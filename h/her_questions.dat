5|$|Bran Stark is {{learning}} how to be the Lord of Winterfell while his older brother is away at war. He has a strange dream, where he sees himself as Summer, his direwolf, running in the Godswood. The next morning, {{he goes to the}} Godswood with Osha, who tries to pry about his dreams, but Bran ignores <b>her</b> <b>questions.</b> The pair notice a red comet in the sky; Bran remarks that the men claim it is an omen of victory for one side or another in the war, but Osha insists it means one thing: dragons have returned.|$|E
5|$|First-millennium Indian scholars, such as Sureshvara (Suresvaracharya, c. 750 CE), {{have viewed}} this male-female {{dialogue}} as profound on both sides; Maitreyi refuses wealth, wishing {{to share her}} husband's spiritual knowledge, and in the four known versions of the Upanishadic story she challenges Yajnavalkya's theory of Atman. Yajnavalkya acknowledges her motivations, and that <b>her</b> <b>questions</b> are evidence she is a seeker of ultimate knowledge and a lover of the Atman.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Tomb Raider III was {{accompanied}} by an extensive marketing campaign. To promote the game, English model Nell McAndrew was hired to appear as Lara Croft on a press tour across Italy, Spain, Germany, the US, and Australia. McAndrew also made appearances on various multimedia outlets, including TV shows, radio stations, and department stores, while Lara Croft appeared on the front cover of most UK games magazines. Other highlights included French TV advertisements for the SEAT car manufacturer and a music video for the German band Die Ärzte. British sports lifestyle brand Animal designed and merchandised a range of Lara Croft clothes and accessories, while Core Design launched its own clothing articles. In May 1998, {{a demonstration of the}} game was presented at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, Georgia. The show included a virtual appearance of Lara, which allowed the audience to ask <b>her</b> <b>questions.</b> According to Core Design's PR manager Susie Hamilton, a total of £1.7 millions was spent on the marketing campaign.|$|E

25|$|Besant {{began to}} {{question}} her own faith. She turned to leading churchmen for advice, going to see Edward Bouverie Pusey, {{one of the leaders}} of the Oxford Movement within the Church of England. When she asked him to recommend books that would answer <b>her</b> <b>questions,</b> he told her she had read too many already. Besant returned to Frank to make a last unsuccessful effort to repair the marriage. She finally left for London.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{made her}} film debut in 2007 in the romance/drama film My Blueberry Nights, {{directed}} by Wong Kar Wai, co-starring Jude Law, David Strathairn, Rachel Weisz and Natalie Portman.

25|$|At {{this point}} Anderson, {{who is no}} longer a {{prisoner}} and has been allowed to be present at the trial, objects, and the Diktatorat permits her to conduct Dredd's defence instead. She immediately calls Orlok as a witness and questions him about his own involvement in the Apocalypse War. Answering <b>her</b> <b>questions</b> truthfully, Orlok concedes that East-Meg One started the war by sending him to attack Mega-City One with the Block Mania virus, as well as launching the first missiles. He also accepts that, had a similar attack been launched against his own city, his response would have been similar to Dredd's.|$|E
25|$|Norma has Max {{deliver the}} edited Salome script to her former director, Cecil B. DeMille (played by himself), at Paramount. Afterwards, {{she begins to}} receive calls from Paramount {{executive}} Gordon Cole, but petulantly refuses to speak to anyone except DeMille. Eventually, she has Max drive her and Joe to Paramount in her 1929 Isotta Fraschini, where she is greeted warmly by the older studio employees. DeMille receives her affectionately and treats her with great respect, but tactfully evades <b>her</b> <b>questions</b> about Salome. Meanwhile, Max learns that Cole merely wants to rent her unusual car for a film.|$|E
500|$|In {{establishing}} {{the office of}} the director, the Bureau of Personnel did not define the responsibilities of the office, nor establish clear lines of authority. [...] "...Lieutenant Commander McAfee was simply told that she was to [...] "run" [...] the women's reserve and she was to go directly to the Chief of Naval Personnel for answers to <b>her</b> <b>questions.</b> Unfortunately, the decision was not made known to the operating divisions of the bureau." ...|$|E

500|$|One {{of these}} was Eros Djarot's 1988 film Tjoet Nja' Dhien, in which Hakim was cast as Acehnese guerilla leader Cut Nyak Dhien. It won the 1989 Cannes Film Festival award for Best International Film, being {{screened}} in Le Semaine de Critique. Hakim later described the role as a [...] "huge honour" [...] and [...] "very challenging"; she has credited the role for answering <b>her</b> <b>questions</b> on her identity. The film later became Indonesia's submission to the 62nd Academy Awards for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E
500|$|During the canvassing, Leslie {{says she}} may {{resort to the}} tactics of Karl Rove, advisor to former President George W. Bush, in phrasing <b>her</b> <b>questions</b> to {{guarantee}} positive responses. Leslie refers to Andy as [...] "a cute FDR", a reference to former President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Leslie says her mother is as respected as charity worker Mother Teresa, as powerful as Soviet Union dictator Joseph Stalin and as beautiful as British politician Margaret Thatcher. A PDF copy of the town hall meeting flyer was posted on NBC's official Parks and Recreation website about Pawnee, Indiana; it included before-and-after pictures of the proposed park.|$|E
500|$|Pharris {{assumed the}} role in 2001, but later {{decided to not}} renew her {{contract}} in order to pursue other projects. During an interview with The Christian Post, she said that her time on Passions helped her to realize that her occupation as an actress {{could be used as}} a platform to advocate for Christianity. Doe was hired for the third and final re-casting after moving to Los Angeles from New York, where she was primarily offered the role of [...] "a runaway teenager, a prostitute, a drug dealer". Initially hesitant to assume a character already established by other actors, she became friendly with Pharris, who answered all of <b>her</b> <b>questions</b> about the character.|$|E

500|$|Lydia of The Observer {{enjoyed the}} [...] "Russian doll" [...] of the novel's {{multiple}} layers, and its [...] "keen emotional pull." [...] Though she had certain misgivings along the way, {{she felt that}} the last few pages answered all <b>her</b> <b>questions</b> and [...] "moved [...] almost to tears." [...] Lucy Kellaway of the Financial Times {{was taken by the}} stories within the story, and though they tended to [...] "suck vivacity from the main narrative", she saw this as a device to illuminate the [...] "different crafts of writing short stories and novels." [...] Benjamin Errett, writing for the National Post, pointed out how McEwan had blended spy fiction and literary criticism to a combination that was both exciting and intellectually stimulating. In reference to Serena and Tom's different literary preferences, he concluded that [...] "his novel is juicy enough to satisfy them both." ...|$|E
500|$|Weeks later, Augustus tells Hazel he has traced Van Houten's assistant, Lidewij, and has {{corresponded with}} Van Houten by email. She writes {{to him to}} find out more about the novel's {{ambiguous}} ending. Van Houten replies that he is only willing to answer <b>her</b> <b>questions</b> in person. Hazel asks her mother if she can travel to Amsterdam to visit him, but Frannie refuses because of financial and medical constraints. Augustus suggests that she use the [...] "cancer wish" [...] she received from Make-A-Wish Foundation but Hazel explains that she has already used hers to visit Disney World. Augustus and Hazel go on a picnic date and begin to fall in love. Augustus surprises Hazel with tickets to Amsterdam. After a medical setback, Hazel's doctors eventually agree to allow the trip, since they expect that she will soon become incapable of doing anything at all.|$|E
500|$|Evanescence re-entered Blackbird Studio in Nashville {{in early}} April 2011 with 19 songs and new {{producer}} Nick Raskulinecz, who previously produced for Alice in Chains and Foo Fighters. The album was mixed by Randy Staub. After an initial denial by band management, on June 12 Lee confirmed that guitarist Troy McLawhorn had rejoined Evanescence. She also {{announced that the}} album would be released on October 4, 2011; the date was later pushed back a week by Wind-up Records. According to Lee, when the band returned to the studio, she wanted the album released {{as soon as possible}} because of the long time since Evanescence's last album. The instruments other than pianos were recorded first, followed by the pianos and then by Lee's vocals; she said the demanding songs made her [...] "push" [...] herself vocally. Raskulinecz's production, she said, made Evanescence a rock album. Lee appreciated his work, including the producer's willingness to answer <b>her</b> <b>questions</b> and determine when the album would be finished: ...|$|E

500|$|At Warren's first Banking Committee {{hearing in}} February 2013, she pressed several banking {{regulators}} to answer {{when they had}} last taken a Wall Street bank to trial and stated, [...] "I'm really concerned that 'too big to fail' has become 'too big for trial'." [...] Videos of Warren's questioning became popular on the Internet, amassing {{more than one million}} views in a matter of days. At a Banking Committee hearing in March, Warren asked Treasury Department officials why criminal charges were not brought against HSBC for its money laundering practices. With <b>her</b> <b>questions</b> being continually dodged, Warren compared money laundering to drug possession, saying: [...] "If you're caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are good you're going to go to jail... But evidently, if you launder nearly a billion dollars for drug cartels and violate our international sanctions, your company pays a fine and you go home and sleep in your own bed at night." ...|$|E
500|$|When Bethlehem Steel Corporation {{permanently}} laid up Fitzgeralds sister ship, SS Arthur B. Homer, {{just five}} years after going to considerable expense to lengthen <b>her,</b> <b>questions</b> were raised as to whether both ships had the same structural problems. The two vessels {{were built in the}} same shipyard using welded joints instead of the riveted joints used in older ore freighters. Riveted joints allow a ship to flex and work in heavy seas, while welded joints are more likely to break. Reports indicate that repairs to Fitzgeralds hull were delayed in 1975 due to plans to lengthen the ship during the upcoming winter layup. Homer was lengthened to [...] and placed back in service by December 1975, not long after Fitzgerald foundered. In 1978, without explanation, Bethlehem Steel Corporation denied permission for the chairman of the NTSB to travel on Homer. Homer was permanently laid up in 1980 and broken for scrap in 1987.|$|E
500|$|Once {{the bear}} was dressed {{and in the}} chair, the {{audience}} would be allowed into the tent. The showman would tell the audience that the Pig-faced Lady could not speak, but would answer questions put to her, with one grunt for [...] "yes" [...] and two for [...] "no". The audience would ask <b>her</b> <b>questions,</b> {{and a member of}} the crew would poke the bear with a stick to make it grunt in reply. The Pig-faced Lady would then eat a meal of gruel, beer and apples, served in a silver trough. The display of [...] "pig-faced ladies" [...] became extremely popular, to the extent that by 1861 Charles Dickens remarked that [...] "no fair was complete without one". Exhibitions of this type were particularly popular in Dublin; an exhibition in Plymouth in the 1880s was less successful, and a disbelieving mob pulled the wig and hat from a [...] "Pig-faced Lady" [...] in her tent and proceeded to attack the showmen. The fate of the bear is not recorded.|$|E
