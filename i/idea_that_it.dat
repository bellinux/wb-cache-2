5|$|Once Pluto was found, its faintness {{and lack}} of a resolvable disc {{cast doubt on the}} <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was Lowell's Planet X. Estimates of Pluto's mass were revised {{downward}} throughout the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Theories {{as to the}} {{derivation}} of the Peak District name {{include the}} <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> came from the Pecsaetan or peaklanders, an Anglo-Saxon tribe who inhabited the central and northern parts of the area from the 6th century AD when it fell within the large Anglian kingdom of Mercia.|$|E
5|$|A {{practical}} use for Twitter's real-time functionality is {{as an effective}} de facto emergency communication system for breaking news. It was neither intended nor designed for high-performance communication, but the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{could be used for}} emergency communication was not lost on the creators, who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on when the company used it to communicate during earthquakes.|$|E

50|$|The {{origin of}} the name Coos is uncertain: one <b>idea</b> is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is derived from a Hanis stem gus- meaning 'south' as in gusimídži·č 'southward'; another <b>idea</b> is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is derived from a southwestern Oregon Athabaskan word ku·s meaning 'bay'.|$|R
5|$|The DOB {{spread to}} Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, and The Ladder {{was mailed to}} hundreds—eventually thousands—of DOB members {{discussing}} the nature of homosexuality, sometimes challenging the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a sickness, with readers offering their own reasons why they were lesbians, and suggesting ways {{to cope with the}} condition or society's response to it. British lesbians followed with the publication of Arena Three beginning in 1964, with a similar mission.|$|E
5|$|The United States' {{declaration}} of independence from Great Britain in 1776 led criollos (Spanish peoples born in the Americas) to believe that revolution and independence from Spain were feasible. Between 1775 and 1783, the American patriots of the Thirteen Colonies waged the American Revolutionary War against both the local loyalists and the Kingdom of Great Britain, eventually establishing a popular government {{in the place of}} the British monarchy. The fact that Spain aided the colonies in their struggle against Britain weakened the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be a crime to end one's allegiance to the parent state.|$|E
5|$|The condor {{on top of}} {{the shield}} {{stretches}} his wings to symbolize power, greatness and strength of Ecuador. The condor also represents the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will always be ready to attack any enemy. The shield is flanked by four national flags. The laurel on the left represents the victories of the republic. The palm leaf on the right side is a symbol of the martyrs of the fight for independence and liberty. The Fasces below the shield represents the republican dignity. The final design of the coat of arms was completed in 1900.|$|E

Everybody can attain that and have that in their life. Consider the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it’s</b> inner God. It’s in every child that’s born; every child carries this ability within them. And I like that sentiment." ...|$|R
5|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} or Liverpool pigeon (Caloenas maculata) is {{a species of}} pigeon which is most likely extinct. It was first {{mentioned}} and described in 1783 by John Latham, who had seen two specimens of unknown provenance and a drawing depicting the bird. The taxonomic relationships of the bird were long obscure, and early writers suggested many different possibilities, though the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was related to the}} Nicobar pigeon (C. nicobarica) prevailed, and it was therefore placed in the same genus, Caloenas. Today, the species is only known from a specimen kept in World Museum, Liverpool. Overlooked for much of the 20th century, it was recognised as a valid extinct species by the IUCN Red List only in 2008. In 2014 a genetic study confirmed it as a distinct species related to the Nicobar pigeon, and showed that the two were the closest relatives of the extinct dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1970s plans {{continued}} to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock {{site and the}} whole of the south docks system in general. Many of these plans were quite extreme including Liverpool City Council's suggestion to use the dock basin as a landfill site. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously was the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> become the new home of Liverpool Polytechnic (now John Moores University). The government was even willing to provide £3m in funding but like so many other plans this too fell by the wayside.|$|E

Space exploration {{in the future is}} going to evolve into this <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> not just about going out there and finding planets to build colonies. It also has this inherent <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the further we go out, the more we learn about ourselves. The characters in this movie are preoccupied with the idea: what are our origins?"

These decisions need however {{to be linked to}} company manufacturing strategies. If we study the manufacturing strategy field, we can see that these decisions give large consequences in many decision categories.

40|$|In {{considering}} {{all of the}} issues and queries that have arisen throughout the SCEiP project, perhaps one of the ones that still surprises me is the “but I can’t do both” statement.

25|$|From the Dutch scholar Cornelius de Pauw, Hoffman {{took the}} <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{forbidden}} {{for women to}} iherit the throne of Egypt, an important plot point in the opera. He also researched details of Egyptian funerary rites in Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus.|$|E
25|$|Uemura {{added an}} eject lever to the {{cartridge}} slot {{which was not}} really necessary, but he felt that children could be entertained by pressing it.

25|$|Nonetheless, {{around the}} same time that Evans was {{publishing}} his theory of a pagan survival, there were also researchers who had examined the origins of the Society and criticised the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had ancient roots. In 1962, Hamish Henderson detailed how it had arisen in the eighteenth century, with his information being expanded upon by Ian Carter in his 1979 study of agricultural life in Scotland.|$|E

25|$|The {{assignment}} of a whole-number oxidation {{state is a}} formalism, as the covalent bonds {{are not required to}} have perfect bond orders involving whole electron transfer. Thus, all three models for paramagnetic Hb-O2 may contribute to some small degree (by resonance) to the actual electronic configuration of Hb-O2. However, the model of iron in Hb-O2 being Fe(III) is more correct than the classical <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> remains Fe(II).|$|E
25|$|In July 2012, Dangote {{approached}} the Nigerian Ports Authorities to lease an abandoned {{piece of land}} at the Apapa Port, which was approved. He later built facilities for his flour company there. In the 1990s, he {{approached the}} Central Bank of Nigeria with the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be cheaper for the bank to allow his transport company to manage their fleet of staff buses, a proposal that was also approved.|$|E
25|$|Robertson {{told the}} War Committee (22 February 1916) that the French desire to {{transfer}} {{more troops to}} Salonika showed a weakening in their resolve for trench warfare. He scorned the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would bring Greece into the war on the Allied side, and at a late March 1916 conference argued with Briand (French Prime Minister) and Joffre, who thumped the table and shouted that Robertson was “un homme terrible”.|$|E
