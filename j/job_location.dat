40|$|Basic {{to several}} key issues in current urban {{economic}} theory {{and public policy}} is a presumption that local imbalances between employment and residential sites strongly influence people's commuting patterns. We examine this presumption by finding the commuting pattern for the Los Angeles region in 1980 which would minimise average commuting time or distance, given the actual spatial distributions of <b>job</b> and housing <b>locations.</b> We find {{that the amount of}} commuting required by these distributions is far less than actual commuting, and that variations in required commuting across <b>job</b> <b>locations</b> only weakly explain variations in actual commuting. We conclude that other factors must be more important to location decisions than commuting cost, and that policies aimed at changing the jobs-housing balance will have only a minor effect on commuting...|$|R
50|$|Commuting cost {{is seen as}} an {{obstacle}} for inner city people to be present for job interviews and furthermore to arrive to work everyday on time.

30|$|Rural-to-urban {{migration}} {{can also}} be used to indicate the impacts of decisions on social conditions and health of rural areas. For example, job creation is a critical factor for rural development and if forests were to be utilized more intensively, new jobs would be created in rural areas since this raw material is mostly located in rural areas. In addition, processing facilities are often located close to the source of raw material for logistic reasons. Hence, decisions fostering the forest bioeconomy could play a role in revitalizing and maintaining inhabited rural areas. Assessing <b>job</b> <b>locations</b> is possible and we would encourage assessing rural development in SIA with rural job creation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The work {{presented}} in this paper concerns the ap-plication of CSPCONS, a distributed constraint logic programming platform to a workforce management problem, namely the BT- 250 - 118 problem instance. The latter is a well-studied problem instance in which the requirement is to create sequences of <b>job</b> <b>locations</b> for the technicians to visit (tours), so as to serve as many jobs as possible, minimizing {{at the same time the}} travel duration. CSPCONS is a logic programming platform that supports program execution over multiple Prolog processes with constraints. It offers channel-based communicating processes and TCP/IP communication and is based on the CSP model introduced by Hoare. This paper demonstrates its applicability to such complex Distributed Constraint Satisfaction problems. I...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{researchers}} have seen living apart {{together as a}} historically new family form. From this perspective LAT couples can pursue both the intimacy {{of being in a}} couple {{and at the same time}} preserve autonomy. [...] Some LAT couples may even de-prioritize couple relationships and place more importance on friendship. [...] Alternatively, others see LAT as just a ‘stage’ on the way to possible cohabitation and marriage. In this view LATs are not radical pioneers moving beyond the family, rather they are cautious and conservative, and simply show a lack of commitment. In addition many may simply be modern versions of ‘steady’ or long term boy/girlfriends. [...] Research using more comprehensive data suggests LAT couples are a heterogeneous social category with varying motivations for living apart. [...] About a third see their relationship as too early for cohabitation, while others are prevented from living together, although they wish to do so, because of constraints like housing costs or (more rarely) <b>job</b> <b>location.</b> Many, however, prefer not to live together even though they have a long term relationship and could do so if they wanted. In practice motivations are often complex, for example one partner might wish to preserve the family home for existing children while the other might welcome autonomous time and space. Sometimes ‘preference’ can have a defensive motivation, for example the emotional desire to avoid the recurrence of a failed or unpleasant cohabiting relationship. Overall, LAT couples may be ‘gladly apart; ‘regretfully apart’ or, for many, undecided and ambivalent where they experience both advantages and disadvantages.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{strippers}} and pornographic actresses, {{who always}} had inherently {{performed in the}} nude with more or less strict regulation laws according to the licenses allowed to their <b>job</b> <b>location,</b> began, {{some time in the}} late 1980s after the widespread fear of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and other STDs and contagions, to a more radical trimming of their pubic hair.The spread of contagious diseases at the time was affecting many in the industry, though it was transmitted by body fluids, not hair. Though, one expert maintains that the sole reason for the removal in pornography was a matter of [...] "technical considerations of cinematography". The fashion progressed to the extremes of reducing ever increasing amounts of pubic hair until its full removal. The widespread consuming of porn film and its watching, increased by the parallel boom of domestic video use, would catapult the adoption and mimicking of the concurrent fashion by the general public of women of the time. The fashion of such practices would reach cult status, and the growth of a whole industry dedicated to its maintenance after its implanted social acceptance and even some universal projection, it soon acquired the negative connotations of discrimination to any pubic hair in women (and even on men) in a totalitarian turn of social intolerance.Observation of most pornographic or artistic nude material before that decade and from the advent of the filming or photography camera, would show most if not all the performers or models with their own pubic hair differences of growth, with no signs of invested rejection or manipulated discrimination. The presentation is regarded by some as being erotic and aesthetic, while others consider the style as unnatural. Some people remove pubic hairs for erotic and sexual reasons or because they or their sex partner enjoy the feel of a hairless crotch.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade the {{importance}} of attitude-related residential self-selection has frequently been recognized. In addition people can theoretically self select them with respect to other location choices, such as <b>job</b> <b>locations,</b> with respect to travel behavior, or {{with respect to the}} exposure to transport externalities such as noise and congestion. In this paper we argue that insights into self-selection processes might significantly improve our knowledge on location choices, travel behavior, and transport externalities.

We think the most important categories that self-selection relates to (1) travel behavior preferences (mode choice, travel frequency, travel time, travel distances) and related location choices, (2) exposure to transport externalities (congestion, safety/risk, noise), and (3) vehicle choice and driving behavior.
