The 2009 Water Resources Law (Ley de Recursos Hídricos) and the draft National Water Resources Management Strategy of 2004 (Estrategia Nacional para la Gestión de los Recursos Hídricos Continentales del Perú) contain the necessary elements for Integrated Water Resources Management as stated in international good practices namely, integration of sectoral policies, participation of stakeholders, decentralization of management to the river basin level and recognition of water as a social and economic good. Despite the new law, several key challenges remain, including limited institutional capacity, increasing water stress in the coastal region, deteriorating water quality, poor efficiency in the <b>irrigation</b> <b>sector,</b> as well as inadequate access to and poor quality of water supply and sanitation.|$|E

2500|$|Until recent history, {{groundwater}} was not {{a highly}} utilized resource. In the 1960s, more and more groundwater aquifers developed. Changes in knowledge, technology and funding have allowed for focused development into abstracting water from groundwater resources away from surface water resources. These changes allowed for progress in society such as the [...] "agricultural groundwater revolution", expanding the <b>irrigation</b> <b>sector</b> allowing for increased food production and development in rural areas. Groundwater supplies {{nearly half of all}} drinking water in the world. The large volumes of water stored underground in most aquifers have a considerable buffer capacity allowing for water to be withdrawn during periods of drought or little rainfall. This is crucial for people that live in regions that cannot depend on precipitation or surface water as a supply alone, instead providing reliable access to water all year round. As of 2010, the world's aggregated groundwater abstraction is estimated at approximately 1,000km3 per year, with 67% used for irrigation, 22% used for domestic purposes and 11% used for industrial purposes. The top ten major consumers of abstracted water (India, China, United States of America, Pakistan, Iran, Bangladesh, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Italy) make up 72% of all abstracted water use worldwide. Groundwater has become crucial for the livelihoods and food security of 1.2 to 1.5 billion rural households in the poorer regions of Africa and Asia.|$|E

In the wake of the Arab Spring, the Egyptian government has lost much of the regional clout that allowed it to maintain it’s ‘lion’s share’ of the Nile as outlined by the 1959 agreement. Population and economic growth in upstream countries, specifically Ethiopia, have resulted in intensified calls for a more equitable water-sharing agreement. Just weeks after Mubarak stepped down, Ethiopia unveiled plans to build the Grand Renaissance Dam. The GRD will significantly reduce the water that reaches Egypt’s borders but will significantly increase Ethiopia’s hydroelectric power and irrigation potential. Egypt’s population and agriculture sector rely heavily on the maintenance of this status quo; the country also faces the mounting effects of climate change, rising food prices and immense population growth. In order to avoid a severe water crisis, Egypt must be proactive and look to improve efficiency within its own borders. This paper will examine the inadequacies of Egypt’s agricultural and <b>irrigation</b> <b>sectors.</b> It will then use examples from Mexico’s successful irrigation reform and advocate a shift of control to local Water User Associations.

40|$|South Asia {{in general}} and India in {{particular}} is heavily dependent on groundwater for supporting its largely agrarian population. Informal pump irrigation services markets have {{played an important role}} in providing access to irrigation to millions of small and marginal farmers and had positive equity, efficiency and sustainable impacts in water-abundant regions such as West Bengal. Quite predictably, in such pump lift-based economy, fortunes of energy and <b>irrigation</b> <b>sectors</b> are closely entwined. This has often been called the 'energy-irrigation' nexus. There are two major sources of energy for pumping groundwater, viz. electricity and diesel. Most of the current discourse in the field has looked only at the 'electricity-irrigation' nexus to the exclusion of the 'diesel-irrigation nexus'. This paper looks at both these aspects. In doing so, it makes two propositions. First, high flat-rate electricity tariff encourages development of water markets whereby the water buyers?who are mostly small and marginal farmers?benefit through access to irrigation. Second, low rate of rural electrification has forced majority of farmers to depend on diesel for groundwater pumping and the steep increase in diesel prices over the last few years has resulted in economic scarcity of groundwater. This in turn has had serious negative impacts on crop production and farm incomes. Using primary field data from West Bengal, India, this paper makes a case for rapid rural electrification and continuation of high flat-rate tariff, which would in turn support developed groundwater markets and provide access to irrigation to the poor and marginal farmers...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. While {{researchers}} have paid considerable {{attention to the}} effect of soil salinity on crop yield, methodological impediments remain when salinity is combined with other growth factors, especially in farmers' fields. A specific methodology was adapted to assess the effect of waterlogging and salinity on date palm yield (Phoenix dactylifera L. cv. Deglet Noor). Materials and methods. Date palm yield, water table depth, irrigation water, groundwater and soil salinity were measured in 167 field plots located in five <b>irrigation</b> <b>sectors</b> of the Wargla basin (Algeria). Variance analysis and a boundary line approach were combined to analyze actual and potential yields according to environmental stresses. Results and discussion. High soil salinity resulted from saline irrigation water and a shallow water table. Actual yield decreased with the increase in soil salinity, the decrease in water table depth, and the presence of a gypsum-cemented horizon within the soil profile. The significant effect of the interaction between water table depth and soil salinity showed that the crop responded to the most severe stress rather than to combinations of the individual effects. Potential yield was assessed according to classes of water table depth, soil salinity and the occurrence of a gypsum-cemented horizon. The relationship between soil salinity and potential yield was calibrated according to two models. The limiting factors in order of decreasing importance were shallow water table, high soil salinity and occurrence of a gypsum-cemented horizon for 38. 3 %, 16. 8 % and 2. 4 % of the field plots, respectively; there was no limiting factor for 42. 5 % of the field plots. In certain sectors, actual yields remained far below potential yields and the additional effect of irrigation water salinity could thus be considered. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
