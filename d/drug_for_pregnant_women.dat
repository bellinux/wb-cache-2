The substance has been reported as “one of the most potent teratogenic substances in medical history” [5].

Twenty-seven middle-aged TE individuals and 27 age- and gender-matched CTR were examined by cervical spine MRI. The presence of malformations, disc herniation(s), osteophytes, nerve and medullary compression and the degree of disc degeneration (DD) were evaluated. Significantly higher degree of DD was seen in the TE group compared with the controls (p< 0. 001). Similar frequencies of disc herniation and disc space narrowing were observed in the two groups, but more foraminal narrowing was seen in the TE group (p = 0. 002). DD was observed relatively frequently at all cervical levels in the TE group, however, mainly at the two lower levels in the CTR. Middle-aged individuals with TE have a higher frequency of degenerative changes in the cervical spine than controls, possibly caused by an altered load on the cervical spine...|$|E
40|$|Too many {{children}} are still being newly infected with HIV. The Global Plan is to eliminate new HIV infections among children by 2015 and keep their mothers alive. The rate of MTCT of HIV- 1 has fallen to less than 2 % in countries {{with the implementation of}} recommendations. The best documented factor that correlates to higher rates of transmission is the maternal level of plasma viremia. Therefore it is important to maximally inhibit HIV replication in order to prevent HIV-associated morbidity and mortality and to prevent MTCT. Durable viral suppression prolongs life by improving immune function and overall quality of life, lowering the risk of both AIDs-defining and non-AIDS-defining complications. Clinical data are more limited on antiretroviral drugs in pregnant women than in non-pregnant individuals due to concerns for maternal and fetal safety, ethical considerations, the difficulty in designing appropriate trials to assess the study objectives, and funding limitations. However there are sufficient data to base recommendations for drug choice for many of the available antiretroviral drugs. Preferred drugs must show durable viral suppression, increased CD 4 cell count, and a favorable safety profile. In addition to the aforementioned characteristics of a preferred drug, preferred antiretroviral drugs for pregnant individuals must pay special attention to maternal toxicity, potential teratogenicity, and fetal safety, efficacy of reducing perinatal transmission, and pharmacokinetics data during the perinatal transmission of HIV. Currently the optimal initial antiretroviral regimens to treat antiretroviral-naïve patients in high resource regions consist of two nucleoside/tide reverse transcription inhibitors in combination with either a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or a protease inhibitor boosted with RTV. Continually re-evaluation is recommended to challenge current paradigms. Treatment advances may lead to safer and even superior alternatives to current first-line therapy. The WHO current first-line therapy in less developed or developing regions includes the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, EFV and considerations of poorer overall efficacy compared to newer drugs, toxicity, resistance, and adverse effects suggest that EFV should be reconsidered for use in first-line therapy. Although preferred protease inhibitors are as effective as EFV with fewer adverse effects, serious issues arise when patients are on concomitant medications with drug interactions. Currently raltegravir is the only integrase strand transfer inhibitor drug (INSTI) with data during pregnancy. Raltegravir is an attractive alternative or additional <b>drug</b> <b>for</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> requiring medications with resistance, incomplete virologic response, or significant interactions with current first-line regimen drugs. Furthermore, based on recent data, raltegravir could provide pre-exposure prophylaxis in the fetus. DTG is a newer generation INSTI with clinical trials data showing safety and efficacy in nonpregnant adults. These studies suggest great promise for DTG and justify its role as first-line therapy for the nonpregnant population with relatively few drug interactions; in addition, it offers the only single tablet regimen for patient with or at risk for renal dysfunction. Although more data must be collected to ensure the safety and efficacy of INSTI as a first-line therapy in pregnant women, current studies show promise and with increasing experience INSTI agents may become part of the recommended first-line regimen for pregnant women...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prescribing}} of psychotropic medicines for the {{paediatric population}} is rapidly increasing. In attempts {{to curb the}} use of psychotropic medicine in the paediatric population, regulatory authorities have issued various warnings about risks associated with use of these products in childhood. Little evidence has been reported about the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of these medicines in practice. As spontaneous reports are the main source for information about previously unknown ADRs, we analysed data submitted to a national ADR database. The objective was to characterise ADRs reported for psychotropic medicines in the Danish paediatric population over a decade. Findings All spontaneous ADR reports from 1998 to 2007 for children from birth to 17 years of age were included. The unit of analysis was one ADR. We analysed the distribution of ADRs per year, seriousness, age and gender of the child, suspected medicine and type of reported ADR. A total of 429 ADRs were reported for psychotropic medicines and 56 % of these were classified as serious. Almost 20 % of psychotropic ADRs were reported for children from birth up to 2 {{years of age and}} one half of ADRs were reported in adolescents, especially for antidepressants and psychostimulants. Approximately 60 % of ADRs were reported for boys. Forty percent of all ADRs were from the category 'nervous and psychiatric disorders'. All but one ADR reported for children below two years were serious and two of these were fatal. A number of serious ADRs reported in children from birth up to 2 years of age were presumably caused by mothers' use of psychotropic medicines during pregnancy. Conclusion The high number of serious ADRs reported for psychotropic medicines in the paediatric population should be a concern for health care professionals and physicians. Considering the higher number of birth defects being reported greater care has to be given while prescribing these <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} three decades, there has been {{unprecedented}} growth in medical research utilizing human subjects, with much promise for new treatments that extend life, improve quality of life, and prevent disease and disability. Safe prescribing of drug therapies requires that researchers design clinical trials to test products {{for the benefit of}} all persons who are likely to utilize them, not just a limited population. For this reason, it is essential that clinical trials include <b>women,</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women,</b> children, and racial minorities, as appropriate, because these populations sometimes exhibit different patterns of response or adverse reactions. Despite some significant progress in including women in clinical research, there is a dearth of sound research data on the safety and efficacy of already approved and commonly used medications <b>for</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> At this point, nearly all medications used to treat illness in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women,</b> including common chronic conditions such as hypertension, depression, diabetes, epilepsy, and cancer, are used off-label; that is, outside of the FDA-approved uses based on clinical trial and post-marketing data. Physicians must make prescribing decisions <b>for</b> their <b>pregnant</b> patients without the benefit of randomized, controlled clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of drugs in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> or the impact of these products on the health of the fetus. This problem of prescribing in the dark is receiving some attention in the medical and scientific community, but progress appears slow. Meanwhile, <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> face the difficult choice between taking untested drugs or foregoing necessary pharmacotherapy during pregnancy, potentially to the detriment of both woman and fetus. The default position — to exclude <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> from clinical research — is untenable. Although serious challenges in study design, institutional review board (IRB) oversight, and research participant safety make the thought of research in <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> daunting, it is important to find ways to test commonly used drugs in pregnant patients. Postponing action until consensus on the ethical and regulatory issues can be achieved is no solution. Women get ill while pregnant or become pregnant while suffering from chronic illness, and therefore must sometimes take prescription and non-prescription medications. Researchers must, therefore, design and implement clinical trials and other types of data collection techniques for both new and already-approved drugs and therapies that will generate data for the safe use of these <b>drugs</b> <b>for</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> and their fetuses. This article will describe the current status of inclusion of <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> in research, and will discuss some of the FDA-related regulatory barriers to collecting safety and efficacy information and approaches to improve the availability of data to support safe drug prescribing during pregnancy. Finally, although pro-life constituencies have significant influence on health policy, efforts to improve {{the quality and quantity of}} safety data should not bow to external, non-science-based attempts at interference with these goals...|$|R

Fear of negative consequences often promotes denial of <b>drug</b> use. <b>For</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women,</b> social stigma {{and fear of}} legal consequences make underreporting of drug use even more likely. An indirect screener that could effectively identify <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> at risk <b>for</b> illicit <b>drug</b> use without reliance on disclosure would be clinically significant. The {{purpose of the current}} study was to develop and validate an indirect measure of prenatal drug use by comparing correlates of prenatal drug use to urinalysis results. METHOD: <b>Pregnant</b> <b>women</b> attending an OB appointment at the VCUHS Women’s Health Clinic were recruited and consented to participate in an anonymous, two-phase study. In Phase 1, women completed a 20 -minute computerized assessment which included a true/false index of items known to tap behavioral, medical, psychological, experiential and demographic correlates of drug abuse and dependence. In Phase 2, participants were asked to provide a urine sample <b>for</b> <b>drug</b> testing. Women received a $ 20 gift card after they participated in each phase. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-one women completed both Phase 1 and 2 (94 % completion rate). Participants were primarily African-American (66 %), single (75 %) and receiving public assistance (70 %). Urinalysis revealed that 16 % of the sample tested positive <b>for</b> recent <b>drug</b> use, while only 5 % of women self-reported past month drug use. After examining the univariate and multivariate relationships between each indirect item and drug status (i. e., positive or negative urinalysis), six indirect items were chosen to comprise the Wayne Indirect Drug Use Screener-Pregnancy (WIDUS-P). Cross-validation analyses resulted in a sensitivity of. 90, specificity of. 75, and AUC of. 85.

40|$|Background & objectives: Mother-to-child {{transmission}} (MTCT) is {{the most}} significant route of HIV transmission in children below the age of 15 yr. In India, perinatal HIV transmission, even after treatment, accounts for 5. 4 per cent of HIV cases. The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of anti-retro viral therapy (ART) or prophylactic treatment (PT) to control maternal viral load in HIV positive women, and its effect on vertical HIV transmission to their infants. Methods: A total of 58 HIV positive women were enrolled at the time of delivery and their plasma samples were obtained within 24 h of delivery for estimation of viral load. Viral load analysis was completed in 38 women. Infants received single dose nevirapine within 2 h of birth and zidovudine for 6 wk. At the end of 18 month follow up, HIV positive or negative status was available in 28 infants. Results: Results revealed undetectable levels of viral load in 58. 3 per cent of women with ART compared to 30. 7 per cent of women with PT. No women on ART had viral load more than 10, 000 copies/ml, whereas seven (26. 9 %, P= 0. 07) women receiving PT had this viral load. Median CD 4 count of women on PT (483 cells/μl) was high compared to the women on ART (289 cells/ μl). At the end of 18 months follow up, only two children were HIV positive, whose mothers were on PT. One had in utero transmission; infection detected within 48 h of delivery, while the other child was infected post partum as HIV was detected at six months follow up. Interpretation & conclusions: Women who received a single dose of nevirapine during delivery had higher levels of viral load than women on ART. Combination <b>drug</b> therapy <b>for</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> is now a standard of care in most of the western countries; use of nevirapine monotherapy at the time of delivery in our settings is not effective in controlling viral load.

40|$|Abstract Background Abuse of {{addictive}} substances is {{a serious}} problem that has a significant impact on areas such as health, the economy, and public safety. Heroin use among young women of reproductive age has drawn much attention around the world. However, {{there is a lack of}} information on effects of prenatal exposure to opioids on their offspring. In this study, an animal model was established to study effects of prenatal exposure to opioids on offspring. Methods Female pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were sub-grouped to receive (1) vehicle, (2) 2 - 4 mg/kg morphine (1 mg/kg increment per week), (3) 7 mg/kg methadone, and (4) 3 mg/kg buprenorphine, subcutaneously, once or twice a day from E 3 to E 20. The experiments were conducted on animals 8 - 12 weeks old and with body weight between 250 and 350 g. Results Results showed that prenatal exposure to buprenorphine caused higher mortality than other tested substance groups. Although we observed a significantly lower increase in body weight in all of the opioid-administered dams, the birth weight of the offspring was not altered in all treated groups. Moreover, no obvious behavioral abnormality or body-weight difference was noted during the growing period (8 - 12 weeks) in all offspring. When the male offspring received morphine injection twice a day for 4 days, the prenatally opioid-exposed rats more quickly developed a tolerance to morphine (as shown by the tail-flick tests), most notably the prenatally buprenorphine-exposed offspring. However, the tolerance development to methadone or buprenorphine was not different in offspring exposed prenatally to methadone or buprenorphine, respectively, when compared with that of the vehicle controlled group. Similar results were also obtained in the female animals. Conclusions Animals prenatally exposed to morphine, methadone, or buprenorphine developed tolerance to morphine faster than their controlled mates. In our animal model, prenatal exposure to buprenorphine also resulted in higher mortality and much less sensitivity to morphine-induced antinociception than prenatal exposure to morphine or methadone. This indicates that buprenorphine in higher doses may not be an ideal maintenance <b>drug</b> <b>for</b> treating <b>pregnant</b> <b>women.</b> This study provides a reference in selecting doses for clinical usage in treating pregnant heroin addicts. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE : To {{evaluate}} {{the safety of}} combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in conception and pregnancy in different health systems. DESIGN : A pilot ART registry to measure the prevalence of birth defects and adverse pregnancy outcomes in South Africa and Zambia. METHODS : HIV-infected <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> on ART prior to conception were enrolled until delivery, and their infants were followed until 1 year old. RESULTS : Between October 2010 and April 2011, 600 women were enrolled. The median CD 4 þ cell count at study enrollment was lower in South Africa than Zambia (320 vs. 430 cells/ml; P< 0. 01). The most common antiretroviral drugs {{at the time of}} conception included stavudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine. There were 16 abortions (2. 7 %), 1 ectopic pregnancy (0. 2 %), 12 (2. 0 %) stillbirths, and 571 (95. 2 %) live infants. Deliveries were more often preterm (29. 7 vs. 18. 4 %; P¼ 0. 01) and the infants had lower birth weights (2900 vs. 2995 g; P¼ 0. 11) in Zambia compared to South Africa. Thirty-six infants had birth defects: 13 major and 23 minor. There were more major anomalies detected in South Africa and more minor ones in Zambia. No neonatal deaths were attributed to congenital birth defects. CONCLUSIONS : An Africa-specific, multi-site antiretroviral <b>drug</b> safety registry <b>for</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>women</b> is feasible. Different prevalence for preterm delivery, delivery mode, and birth defect types between women on preconception ART in South Africa and Zambia highlight the potential impact of health systems on pregnancy outcomes.

The inotropic effect of digoxin is the result of its inhibition of the membrane sodium pump or Na+/K+-ATPase, which {{plays an important role in}} maintaining the resting membrane potential across the plasma membrane through constantly pumping Na+ and K+ across the plasma membrane. Na+/K+-ATPase is not found exclusively in heart muscle. It is also found extensively throughout the brain. As digoxin is the <b>drug</b> of choice <b>for</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>woman</b> with chronic heart failure, this study aimed to examine how digoxin affects brain development and neurons in culture. The well established chicken embryo animal model was used in this study. To probe for deviations from normal brain development, chicken embryos were exposed in ovo. Brains were examined using both transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Microscopy indicated significant damage to the neurons, specifically membranes and mitochondria, as well as cellular death by means of aponecrosis. An unexpected result was premature myelinogenesis in the brain. Chick embryo neurons (CEN) were exposed to digoxin in vitro and cell viability was assessed by performing crystal violet (CV) assays. Results showed that cell number increased over time. This is however, impossible as CEN are non-dividing cells and results were therefore interpreted as an increase in protein synthesis over time, correlating with the myelinogenesis results seen with electron microscopy. To assess membrane integrity, fluorescence microscopy was performed using propidium iodide as stain. Results from this experiment showed a sharp increase in propidium iodide uptake in exposed cells indicative of the membrane damage caused by digoxin. These results also correlated with the aponecrosis seen with electron microscopy, as the nuclei indicated apoptosis while propidium iodide is normally only absorbed by cells undergoing necrosis. Finally, a literature search was conducted to shed some light on the role that digoxin plays in serotonin production and levels in the brain. From the literature it seems that digoxin could increase serotonin production and elevate serotonin levels in the brain, which may influence normal brain development and may therefore play a role in myelinogenesis in the brain.
