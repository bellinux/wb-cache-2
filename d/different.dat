5|$|Design {{management}} {{is not a}} standard model that can be projected onto every enterprise, nor is there a specific way of applying it that leads to guaranteed success. Design management processes are carried out by humans with <b>different</b> responsibilities and backgrounds, who work in <b>different</b> industries and enterprises with <b>different</b> sizes and traditions, whilst having <b>different</b> target groups and markets to serve. Design {{management is}} multifaceted, {{and so are the}} <b>different</b> applications of and views on design management. The function of design management in an organisation depends on its tasks, authority, and practice.|$|E

Kohlberg has responded by saying that although <b>different</b> cultures do indeed inculcate <b>different</b> beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} Noether, Dedekind, and Kähler <b>differents</b> for a 0 -dimensional scheme X in the projective n-space P^n_K over an arbitrary field K. In particular, we focus on studying {{the relations between the}} algebraic structure of these <b>differents</b> and geometric properties of the scheme X. In Chapter 1 we give an outline to the problems this thesis is concerned with, a brief literature review for each problem, and the main results regarding these problems. Chapter 2 contains background results that we will need in the subsequent chapters. We introduce the concept of maximal p_j-subschemes of a 0 -dimensional scheme X and give some descriptions of them and their Hilbert functions. Furthermore, we generalize the notion of a separator of a subscheme of X of degree deg(X) - 1 to a set of separators of a maximal p_j-subscheme of X. In Chapter 3 we explore the Noether, Dedekind, and Kähler <b>differents</b> for 0 -dimensional schemes X. First we define these <b>differents</b> for X, {{and take a look at}} how to compute these <b>differents</b> and examine their relations. Then we give an answer to the question "What are the Hilbert functions of these differents?" in some cases. In Chapter 4 we use the <b>differents</b> to investigate the Cayley-Bacharach property of 0 -dimensional schemes over an arbitrary field K. The principal results of this chapter are characterizations of CB-schemes and of arithmetically Gorenstein schemes in terms of their Dedekind <b>differents</b> and a criterion for a 0 -dimensional smooth scheme to be a complete intersection. We also generalize some results such as Dedekind's formula and the characterization of the Cayley-Bacharach property by using Liaison theory. In addition, several propositions on the uniformities are proven. In Chapter 5 we are interested in studying the Noether, Dedekind, and Kähler <b>differents</b> for finite special classes of schemes and finding out some applications of these <b>differents.</b> First, we investigate these <b>differents</b> for reduced 0 -dimensional almost complete intersections X in P^n_K over a perfect field K. Then we investigate the relationships between these <b>differents</b> and the i-th Fitting ideals of the module of Kähler differentials of the homogeneous coordinate ring of X. Finally, we look more closely at the Hilbert functions and the regularity indices of these <b>differents</b> for fat point schemes...|$|R

5|$|The {{organisation}} of the French 55th Infantry Division was chaotic. Most units {{had been}} involved in construction work and were constantly moved to <b>different</b> tactical positions. Of the nine companies in position by 10 May, only a few had been holding their respective positions for even a few days and were not familiar with them. One of the premier infantry regiments, the 213th Infantry Regiment, was removed from the line altogether and was replaced with the 331st Regiment. In some cases, Infantry regiments were made up of several <b>different</b> companies from several <b>different</b> battalions from <b>different</b> regiments. For example, the 295th Infantry Regiment's 6th Company, 2nd Battalion, was made up of four <b>different</b> companies which were drawn from three <b>different</b> battalions belonging to three <b>different</b> regiments.|$|E
5|$|The {{principles}} of risk parity may be applied differently by <b>different</b> financial managers, {{as they have}} <b>different</b> methods for categorizing assets into classes, <b>different</b> definitions of risk, <b>different</b> ways of allocating risk within asset classes, <b>different</b> methods for forecasting future risk and <b>different</b> ways of implementing exposure to risk. However, many risk parity funds evolve away from their original intentions, including passive management. The {{extent to which a}} risk parity portfolio is managed, is often the distinguishing characteristic between the various kinds of risk parity funds available today.|$|E
