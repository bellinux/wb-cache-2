50|$|The main health concern {{regarding}} e-cigarettes is {{that their}} production is not regulated, and there is immense uncertainty of quality control during manufacturing. Self-rolled tobacco contains more <b>humectants,</b> which are added to tobacco to make it taste better and keep from drying out. As the <b>humectants</b> burn, they unleash chemicals such as acreolein. <b>Humectants</b> are found in most cigarettes and are {{considered one of the}} most dangerous chemicals found in tobacco.|$|R
5000|$|An {{example of}} where <b>humectants</b> {{are used to}} keep food moist is in {{products}} like toothpaste [...] as well as certain kinds of cookies. Regional kinds of cookies often use <b>humectants</b> as a binding agent {{in order to keep}} moisture locked {{into the center of the}} cookie rather than have it evaporate out. <b>Humectants</b> are favored in food products because of their ability to keep consumable goods moist and increase shelf-life.|$|R
25|$|Vegans {{will not}} use {{personal}} care products or household cleaners that contain animal products. Animal ingredients are ubiquitous because they are cheap. After animals are slaughtered for meat, the leftovers are put through the rendering process, and some of that material, particularly the fat, ends up in toiletries. Common ingredients include tallow in soap, and collagen-derived glycerine, used as a lubricant and <b>humectant</b> in many haircare products, moisturizers, shaving foams, soaps and toothpastes.|$|E
25|$|A hand {{sanitizer}} or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent. In the late 1990s and {{early part of}} the 21st century, alcohol rub non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or {{hand sanitizer}}s) began to gain popularity. Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a thickening agent such as Carbomer into a gel, or a <b>humectant</b> such as glycerin into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to decrease the drying effect of the alcohol.|$|E

50|$|<b>Humectants</b> {{are used}} in {{stabilization}} of food products and lengthening shelf life through food and moisture control. The available moisture determines microbial activity, physical properties, sensory properties {{and the rate of}} chemical changes, that if not controlled, are the cause of reduced shelf life. Examples are dry cereal with semi-moist raisins, ice cream in a cone, chocolate, hard candy with liquid centers and cheese. <b>Humectants</b> are used to stabilize the moisture content of foodstuffs and are incorporated as food additives. <b>Humectants</b> are also used in military technology for the use of MREs and other military rations.A number of food items always need to be moist. The use of <b>humectants</b> reduces the available water, thus reducing bacterial activity. They are used for safety issues, for quality, and to have a longer shelf-life in food products.|$|R

40|$|Objective: Confocal Raman {{microspectroscopy}} (CRM) enables non-invasive depth-scanning {{of biological}} tissues. The technique {{has been used}} to obtain information about the molecular composition of the skin, tracking of externally applied compounds and to determine molecular concentration profiles. The objective {{of this study is to}} use CRM in order to evaluate the changes in stratum corneum hydration when applying polyethylene glycol and the <b>humectants</b> urea and glycerol, and thereby also varying the external chemical potential of water. In the present study we also utilize the advantages of CRM to create novel spatial high- resolution Raman images of stratum corneum. Methodology: Excised porcine skin membranes (500 nm in thickness) were equilibrated from the surface with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) together with different types of <b>humectants</b> using Franz cells. The Raman measurements were performed with a WITec alpha 300 system (Ulm, Germany) equipped with a 532 nm laser. The change in stratum corneum hydration after treatment with different <b>humectants</b> was determined from the relative intensity of the water and protein spectra. Raman images were created along a cross section by integrating the Raman intensities for specific vibrational modes. Results and conclusions: The results show that the hydration profiles of stratum corneum correlates well with the gradient in water chemical potential created by the applied <b>humectants,</b> i. e. low molecular weight <b>humectants</b> enable increased hydration of stratum corneum compared to a high molecular weight, non-penetrating polyethylene glycol. In addition the novel results from the Raman imaging experiments illustrates that it is possible to distinguish between water rich domains and the extracellular lipid rich domains along a cross section of the intact skin membrane...|$|R

40|$|<b>Humectants</b> {{belong to}} a group of {{hydrophilic}} compounds frequently used in skin care products with the aim to diminish the clinical symptom of skin dryness. The biochemical and biophysical mechanisms by which <b>humectants</b> interact with the skin barrier are far from fully understood. Increased understanding of such mechanisms can enhance the possibilities to tailor skin care products for various skin abnormalities. The work presented in this thesis centres on one high (hyaluronan) and two low (urea and glycerol) molecular weight <b>humectants</b> and their interactions with water, as well as their effect on the barrier properties of the outermost layer of the skin, i. e. the stratum corneum (SC). We explore the effect of hydration on thermodynamic properties of <b>humectants,</b> in particular hyaluronan, by using isothermal sorption calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry and small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering. By combining data from several methods, a binary phase diagram of the hyaluronan - water system was constructed. We also investigate the effect of hydration and presence of <b>humectants</b> on the SC permeability in vitro by using an experimental set-up that allows for control of the boundary conditions in terms of water activity. In contrast to low molecular weight <b>humectants,</b> like urea and glycerol, it was concluded that hyaluronan (17 kDa) does not penetrate the skin barrier due to size exclusion. Addition of urea, glycerol or hyaluronan to aqueous formulations inevitably lowers the water activity of the formulation, which in tum affects the SC permeability when being applied. Moreover, it was shown that skin permeability of a model drug metronidazole decreases upon addition of hyaluronan to the formulation, while high skin permeability was maintained with addition of urea or glycerol. In addition, skin membrane electrical resistance, which normally increases at dehydrating skin conditions, remained low in presence of urea and glycerol. Excised skin hydrated at different hydration levels were examined with confocal Raman microspectroscopy. Large water inclusions were observed in fully hydrated SC after 24 h exposure to a buffer solution. Addition of urea was shown to promote the formation of these inclusions. Urea and glycerol were also shown to improve the hydration capacity of isolated comeocytes. Similar approach as used in vitro was employed in vivo to explore the effect of hydration and <b>humectants</b> on skin permeability. It was shown that the water activity of the applied formulations have a marked effect on the barrier properties and urea and glycerol was shown to improve skin hydration even at reduced water activity of the applied formulation...|$|R
