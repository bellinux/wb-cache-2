40|$|There is {{presently}} considerable ambiguity and confusion relating to ventilator terminology. This can be eliminated using a simple approach, visualising mechanical ventilation as an inspiratory pump, and defining trigger, limit, and cycling in this context. The trigger is {{the signal that}} starts a breath by opening the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>valve,</b> the limit is the factor which controls the way gas flows into the lung, and the cycle is the signal that stops the breath by closing the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>valve</b> and opening the expiratory valve.

(1) If airway geometry changes occurred between experiments with different gases, flow in theKing, 1966; Duncker, 1971; Jones et al. 1981) has led to speculation that ‘aerodynamic valving ’ is the controlling mechanism for the observed gas-flow patterns (Hazelhoff, 1943; Scheid et al. 1972; Brackenbury, 1971; Kuethe, 1988). Butler et al. (1988), on theoretical grounds, suggested that the convective inertial force of the gas stream (ru 2, strictly, the momentum flux density, where r is gas density and u is velocity) was the aerodynamic mechanism responsible for rectifying flow through the avian lung during inspiration and during inspiration (see Fig. 1). This hypothesis has been confirmed experimentally in intact birds (Banzett et al. 1987). Despite the progress in our understanding of the operation of the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>valve,</b> the mechanisms controlling expiratory valving have not been previously explored in living birds. Expiratory valving is defined here as the mechanism that acts to direct the gas exiting the caudal thoracic and abdominal air sacs to flow through the dorsobronchi and then the parabronchi with no or little flow through the intrapulmonary portion of theIn sharp contrast to most air-breathing vertebrates, gas flows through the major exchange area of the avian lung, the paleopulmonic parabronchi (Fig. 1), in the same direction during both inspiration and expiration (Schmidt-Nielsen et al. 1969...|$|E
40|$|In a {{randomized}} double-blind cross-over study on 20 spontaneously breathing, oxygen-dependent preterm infants {{who had received}} positive pressure ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} one-way non-rebreathing valves of aerosol spacer devices might impair rather than enhance the delivery of aerosols to small infants by metered dose inhalers (MDI). Ten infants were given 2 doses (200 mu g/dose) of MDI albuterol through a neonatal Aerochamber(R) 4 h apart. At tandem sequence, one dose was delivered with the non-rebreathing Valve of the Aerochamber(R) place; for the other dose, the valve had been removed. The experiment was repeated on another ten infants using a different spacer device (Babyhaler(R)) with or without its one-way <b>inspiratory</b> <b>valve</b> removed. During the first hour following aerosol administration, use of the non-valved spacers was associated with a significantly greater degree of tachycardia in both groups, and also lower transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension in the Aerochamber(R) group. All infants showed a reduction in respiratory system resistance and an improvement in functional residual capacity following albuterol treatment. In both groups, maximum reduction in respiratory system resistance, recorded 30 min after aerosol delivery, was significantly greater following the use of the non-valved spacers (Aerochamber(R) : 51. 2 +/- 3. 1 % vs. 35. 0 +/- 2. 8 %, P < 0. 0001; Babyhaler(R) 38. 8 +/- 2. 3 % vs. 19. 2 +/- 1. 4 %, P < 0. 0001) than following the use of the spacers with a valve. The findings provide indirect evidence supporting our hypothesis and suggest that when the MDI is used to deliver therapeutic aerosols to non-ventilated newborns or small infants, a spacer device without a non-rebreathing valve should be used.

40|$|The {{effects of}} 8 wk of inspiratory {{resistive}} loading (30 min/d, 3 x/wk) on diaphragm mass, contractile properties, fatigue, and fiber dimensions were studied in 10 male Wistar rats. They were conditioned to breathe through a Hans-Rudolph device. Half {{of them had}} to overcome a moderate inspiratory resistance (MR; n = 5), whereas the others only had to overcome the small resistance (SR; n = 5) of the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>valve</b> of the device. Results were compared with control rats (C; n = 5) moving and breathing freely. At the end of training, animals submitted to MR and SR generated mean inspiratory pressures of - 2. 5 +/- 1. 1 and - 0. 2 +/- 0. 05 cm H 2 O, respectively. TI/Ttot was 0. 60 +/- 0. 06 and 0. 57 +/- 0. 05, respectively. Body and diaphragm weight were unaffected by loading. Little or no change in in vitro diaphragmatic twitch kinetics, force generation, and fatigability was found between the three groups. Nevertheless, cross-sectional area of all fiber types increased in the two loaded groups compared with control animals. This increase reached statistical significance for type I fibers in the MR group (846 +/- 74 microm 2) compared with the C and SR groups (589 +/- 32 and 683 +/- 96 microm 2, respectively, p < 0. 05). For IIa fibers both training groups were significantly different from the control group (SR: 768 +/- 99 and MR: 790 +/- 108 versus C: 592 +/- 37 microm 2, p < 0. 05). A hypertrophy of type IIx/b fibers was seen in MR compared with control animals (C: 1, 555 +/- 136, SR: 1, 845 +/- 338, MR: 2, 053 +/- 326 microm 2, p < 0. 05). No differences were present in fiber type proportions between the three groups.

40|$|Background: If {{at the end}} of anaesthesia, {{the gases}} on the {{anaesthetic}} machine are not turned off, they continue to flow through the breathing circuit and may dry out the carbon dioxide absorbent in the absorber. At the beginning of the next anaesthetic procedure, the desiccated absorbent decomposes the volatile anaesthetic, resulting in the formation of toxic gas mixtures, which are dangerous for the patient. In such circumstances, the measured level of the volatile anaesthesic in the breathing circuit differs from the selected value. In the paper, we analyse potentially dangerous possible directions of continuous flow of fresh gas mixture in different anaesthetic breathing circuits. 				Methods: In {{the first part of the}} study, we simulated the continuous flow of gases in a Sulla anaesthesia machine using an experimental method in a simulation setting. In the second part, we analysed whether a retrograde flow through the absorber was possible in a convential anaesthetic breathing circuit and in the Fabius GS, Cato, Julian and Primus circuits with the Y-piece connector open or closed. Information on users’ requests for maintenance services due to discrepancies between the desired and measured levels of the volatile anaesthetic in the breathing circuit were obtained from the manufacturer’s local servicing agent. 				Results: In a Dräger ISO 8 circle system (Sulla anaesthetic machine) with a standard gas supply connector, a retrograde flow is not possible. If the Y-piece connector is left open, the gases are vented to the outside via the absorber and the inspiratory tube. If the Y-piece connector is closed or open, the absorbent in the canister dries because of the continuous flow of gas. A retrograde flow is possible only in those Sulla anaesthetic machines where the fresh gas inlet is located below the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>valve.</b> A retrograde flow of gases causing absorbent desiccation can occur in a Cato, Julian, Fabius GS, or Primus anaesthetic machines with the Y-piece connector closed. Maintenance engineers point out that problems are reported mostly on Monday mornings before the first operation. 				Conclusions: After completed anaesthesia, the fresh gas inlets on the anaesthetic machine must always be closed. Especially in older machines, the carbon dioxide absorber must be checked before the first operation on a Monday morning. In new-generation machines, we must make sure that the emergency ventilation valve is closed after the end of anaesthesia...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Assess a {{prototype}} <b>inspiratory</b> impedance threshold <b>valve</b> (ITV) {{designed to enhance}} vital organ circulation during standard and active compression/decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). BACKGROUND: The ITV attaches to commonly used airway assist devices and decreases intrathoracic pressure during the decompression (chest recoil) phase of CPR by creating a vacuum within the thorax, which increases venous {{blood flow to the}} heart and thus increases coronary perfusion pressure and blood flow to the brain. METHODS: The evaluation included laboratory bench testing, according to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and International Standards Organization (ISO) guidelines, and performance testing with pigs in cardiac arrest. A vacuum pull test was developed to determine the inspiratory impedance under various inspiratory flow conditions. RESULTS: The valve passed all minimum ASTM and ISO performance tests. During cardiac arrest in pigs the ITV decreased intrathoracic pressures by 6 – 8 mm Hg during the decompression phase. The vacuum pull test demonstrated that the prototype ITV functioned as intended. CONCLUSIONS: The prototype ITV passed all performance testing recommended by international guidelines and functioned effectively as intended for use. The animal study results, when combined with recent clinical data, suggest that an ITV inspiratory cracking pressure of 12 cm H 2 O should be sufficient to decrease intrathoracic pressure during the decom-pression phase of standard CPR. Clinical studies are now underway.

After 10 min of ventricular fibrillation, and 8 min of standard CPR, ACD ITV CPR was performed in seven 4 - to 6 -wk-old pigs (8 – 12 kg); defibrillation was attempted 8 min later. Within 2 min after initiation of ACD ITV CPR, mean (SEM) coronary perfusion pressure increased from 18 2 to 24 3 mm Hg (p 0. 018). During standard versus ACD ITV CPR, mean left ventricular myocardial and total cerebral blood flow was 59 21 versus 126 32 mL·min 1 · 100 g 1, and 36 7 versus 60 15 mL · min 1 · 100 g 1, respectively (p 0. 028).

40|$|Avian lungs {{are remarkably}} {{different}} from mammalian lungs in that air flows unidirectionally through rigid tubes in which gas exchange occurs. Experimental observations {{have been able}} to determine the pattern of gas flow in the respiratory system, but understanding how the flow pattern is generated and determining the factors contributing to the observed dynamics remains elusive. It has been hypothesized that the unidirectional flow is due to aerodynamic valving during inspiration and expiration, resulting from the anatomical structure and the fluid dynamics involved, however, theoretical studies to back up this hypothesis are lacking. We have constructed a novel mathematical model of the airflow in the avian respiratory system that can produce unidirectional flow which is robust to changes in model parameters, breathing frequency and breathing amplitude. The model consists of two piecewise linear ordinary differential equations with lumped parameters and discontinuous, flow-dependent resistances that mimic the experimental observations. Using dynamical systems techniques and numerical analysis, we show that unidirectional flow can be produced by either effective inspiratory or effective expiratory valving, but that both <b>inspiratory</b> and expiratory <b>valving</b> are required to produce the high efficiencies of flows observed in avian lungs. We further show that the efficacy of the <b>inspiratory</b> and expiratory <b>valving</b> depends on airsac compliances and airflow resistances that may not be located in the immediate area of the valving. Our model provides additional novel insights; for example, we show that physiologically realistic resistance values lead to efficiencies that are close to maximum, and that when the relative lumped compliances of the caudal and cranial airsacs vary, it affects the timing of the airflow across the gas exchange area. These and other insights obtained by our study significantly enhance our understanding of the operation of the avian respiratory system...|$|R
40|$|A {{breathing}} system {{is defined as}} an assembly of components, which delivers gases from the anesthesia machine to the patients′ airways. When the components are arranged as a circle, it is termed a circle system. The flow of exhaled gases is unidirectional in the system. The system contains a component (absorber), which absorbs exhaled carbon dioxide {{and it is not}} necessary to give high fresh gas flows as in Mapleson systems. When the adjustable pressure limiting (APL) valve is closed and all the exhaled gases without carbon dioxide are returned to the patient, the system becomes a totally closed one. Such a circle system can be used with flows as low as 250 to 500 mL and clinically can be termed as low-flow systems. The components of the circle system can be arranged in different ways with adherence to basic rules: (1) Unidirectional valve must be present between the reservoir bag and the patient on both inspiratory and expiratory sides; (2) fresh gas must not enter the system between the expiratory unidirectional valve and the patient; and (3) the APL valve must not be placed between the patient and the <b>inspiratory</b> unidirectional <b>valve.</b> The functional analysis is explained in detail. During the function, the arrangement of components is significant only at higher fresh gas flows. With the introduction of low resistance valves, improved soda lime canisters and low dead space connectors, the use of less complicated pediatric circle systems is gaining popularity to anesthetize children. There are bidirectional flow systems with carbon dioxide absorption. The Waters to and fro system, a classic example of bidirectional flow systems with a canister to absorb carbon dioxide, is valveless and portable. It was widely used in the past and now is only of historical importance...|$|R

Design: Non-randomized crossover study comparing 13 respiratory and eight hemodynamically paired parameters. Eight intubated patients were manually ventilated, each by three different intensive care workers yielding 24 sets of data for comparison. Data were collected during two sessions of manual ventilation, first with the Standard bag {{and then with the}} Smart Bag.

Methods and Results—Using a randomized, prospective, and blinded design, we compared {{the effects of a}} sham versus active ITV on 24 -hour survival and neurological function. After 6 minutes of ventricular fibrillation (VF), followed by 6 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with either a sham or an active valve, anesthetized pigs received 3 sequential 200 -J shocks. If VF persisted, they received epinephrine (0. 045 mg/kg), 90 seconds of CPR, and 3 more 200 -J shocks. A total of 11 of 20 pigs (55 %) in the sham versus 17 of 20 (85 %) in the active valve group survived for 24 hours (P 0. 05). Neurological scores were significantly higher with the active valve; the cerebral performance score (1 normal, 5 brain death) was 2. 20. 2 with the sham ITV versus 1. 40. 2 with the active valve (P 0. 05). A total of 1 of 11 in the sham versus 12 of 17 in the active valve group had completely normal neurological function (P 0. 05).

However, the effect of IMT, alone or with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), on hemodynamic parameters in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) remains unknown. Objective: To assess the effects of an overload of inspiratory muscles using IMT fixed at 30 % of the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and IMT associated with 5 cmH 2 O of PEEP (IMT + PEEP), on the echocardiographic parameters in healthy subjects and patients with COPD. Methods: Twenty patients with COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second 53. 19 ± 24. 71 pred%) and 15 age-matched healthy volunteers were evaluated using spirometry, MIP, the COPD assessment test (CAT), and the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale. The E- (fast-filling phase) and A- (atrial contraction phase) waves were evaluated at the tricuspid and mitral valves during inspiration and expiration in the following sequence: at basal conditions, using IMT, and using IMT + PEEP. Results: Patients with COPD had reduced MIPs versus the control group. Ten patients had CAT scores < 10 and 12 patients had mMRC scores < 2. E-wave values at the mitral valve were significantly decreased with IMT during the inspiratory phase in both groups. These effects were normalized with IMT + PEEP. During the expiratory phase, use of IMT + PEEP normalized the reduction in E-wave values in the COPD group. During inspiration at the tricuspid valve, reduction in E-wave values during IMT was normalized by IMT + PEEP in COPD group. During the expiratory phase, the value of the E-waves was significantly reduced with overload of the inspiratory muscles in both groups, and these effects were normalized with IMT + PEEP. A-waves did not change under any conditions. Conclusion: Acute hemodynamic effects induced by overloading of the inspiratory muscles were attenuated and/or reversed by the addition of PEEP in COPD patients.

These patients when receiving noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) via helmet, experienced more effective output {{with respect to the}} single therapy. Objectives. To evaluate the clinical application of NPPV in ACPE complicated by respiratory effort (RE) hospitalized in ICCU. Population. From January to June 2010, 28 ACPE complicated by RE have been treated with medical therapy and NPPV via helmet. RE is defined by a D-pCO 2 > 2 mmHg value at the entry. D-pCO 2 is the difference between pCO 2 measured and awaited (pCO 2 awaited = 1. 5 *HCO 3 + 8). Intervention. The helmet is made of transparent latex-free PVC. The helmet is secured by two armpit breces at two hooks on the metallic ring that joins the helmet with a soft collar. The pressure increase during ventilation makes the soft collar seal comfortably to the neck and the shoulders, avoiding air leakage. The two ports of the helmet act as inlet and outlet of the gas flow. the <b>inspiratory</b> and expiratory <b>valves</b> are those of mechanical ventilator. Patients with cardiogenic shock, chronic respiratory failure (CRF), anaemia, and other not cardiac causes of dyspnea have been excluded. Initial ventilatory settings were continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode, 5 cm H 2 O, with pressure support ventilation of 10 to 20 cm H 2 O titrated to achieve a respiratory rate less than 25 breaths/min and an exhaled tidal volume of 7 mL/kg or more. Ventilator settings were adjusted following arterial blood gases (ABG) results. Results. Failure to improve ABG values was the reason for ETI in 2 patients (7 %). One patient has died during treatment (3. 5 %). two patients did not tolerate the helmet (7 %). No complications developed {{for the use of the}} helmet. The average duration of NPPV was 27 ± 12 h. After 12 hours of the NINV in these patients has determined an improvement of the cardiac frequency from 109 ± 16 to 81 ± 12 (p= 0. 002), respiratory frequency from 38 ± 6 to 19 ± 3 (p= 0. 002). Arterial blood saturation increased from 74 %± 14 to 96 %± 5 (p< 0. 0001), pH from 7. 21 ± 0. 10 to 7. 40 ± 0. 09 (p= 0. 001), pO 2 from 52 ± 16 to 100 ± 31 (p< 0. 001) as well, while pCO 2 decreased from 66 ± 17 to 41 ± 10 (p= 0. 02). Significant variations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure where not reported. Conclusions. In patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, noninvasive ventilation induces a more rapid improvement in respiratory distress and metabolic disturbance than does standard oxygen therapy, has no effect on short-term mortality.

Uma entrevista prÃvia foi realizada onde a sintomatologia dos pacientes era registrada atravÃs de escores. O exame foi realizado com uma sonda Dentsleeve. O exame consistia em 2 fases. Inicialmente eram realizadas manobras ventilatÃrias padronizadas: arritmia sinusal respiratÃria (ASR), inspiraÃÃo forÃada sob a resistÃncia de uma vÃlvula de resistÃncia inspiratÃria linear (Threshold IMTÂ) com cargas de 17, 35 e 70 cmH 2 O. Finalmente, apÃs uma refeiÃÃo calÃrica padronizada, procedia-se a observaÃÃo dos relaxamentos transitÃrios espontÃneos do EEI (RTEEEIs) por uma hora. Todos os pacientes com esofagite apresentavam pirose. RegurgitaÃÃo ocorreu em 84, 6 % e disfagia em 69, 2 %. A pressÃo basal do EEI nos voluntÃrios com esofagite de refluxo foi semelhante a do grupo de voluntÃrios sadios (GC = 25, 1 Â 4, 1 versus GE = 20, 1 Â 2, 1; p = 0. 251).

The GE was composed of 13 patients diagnosed with mild reflux esophagitis without hiatal hernia or hernias up to 2 cm. The GC was of healthy volunteers. A previous interview was conducted where the symptoms of patients was recorded by scores. The examination was performed with a probe Dentsleeve. The survey consisted of two phases. Initially standardized ventilatory maneuvers were performed: respiratory sinus arrhythmia (ASR), forced inspiration in the strength of a linear <b>inspiratory</b> resistance <b>valve</b> (Threshold Â IMT) with loads of 17, 35 and 70 cmH 2 O. Finally, after a standardized caloric meal, we proceeded to the observation of spontaneous transient relaxation of the LES (RTEEEIs) for one hour. All patients with esophagitis had heartburn. Regurgitation occurred in 84. 6 % and dysphagia in 69. 2 %. The basal LES pressure in subjects with reflux esophagitis was similar to the group of healthy volunteers (GC = 25. 1 Â 4. 1 versus 20. 1 Â GE = 2. 1, p = 0251). The maximum pressure during the maneuver of the EEI during the ASR was lower in GE (94. 3 Â 9. 4 mmHg versus 28. 8 Â 13. 85 mmHg, p = 0. 046). The contraction of the LES pressure during inspiration with a load of 70 cmH 2 O was lower in the GC (166. 6 Â 18 mmHg versus 121. 2 Â 11. 9 mmHg, p = 0. 041). This pressure was positively correlated with basal LES pressure (r 2 = 0. 224; p = 0. 023). The number of spontaneous relaxations of the LES per hour was higher in GE {[15 (6 - 20) ] versus [22 (9 - 38) ], p = 0. 025 }. The total duration of all RTEEEI was also higher in the GC (332. 0 Â 72. 1 versus 711. 2 Â 131. 3, p = 0. 078), but did not reach statistical significance. The average duration of relaxation was not different between the two groups grupos (GC = 23. 3 Â 2. 2 versus GE = 28. 2 Â 3. 1; p= 0. 337). We conclude that the contraction pressure of antireflux barrier in patients with erosive esophagitis is lower than in healthy volunteers, even when they have normal basal pressure of the LES...|$|R
