40|$|The {{culture of}} tiger shrimps (Penaeus monodon) {{with and without}} <b>green</b> <b>mussels</b> (Perna viridis) was {{compared}} in terms of animal growth, survival, production, and pond water quality. Tiger shrimps (2. 6 g) were stocked at 50, 000 /ha in six 1, 000 m 2 earthen ponds. <b>Green</b> <b>mussels</b> (mean shell-on weight of 11 g) were stocked at 100, 000 /ha on ropes suspended from bamboo rafts in three of these ponds.

Higher shrimp production (1, 528. 2 kg/ha) was obtained when these were cultured with mussels than without (1, 327. 5 kg/ha). Water quality did not vary significantly between treatments but ponds with both shrimp and mussel had lesser algae, lower biological oxygen demand and particulate organic matter levels, and generally higher morning dissolved oxygen concentrations compared with ponds without mussels.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the effects of the water quality of Manila Bay on allometric parameters and histological biomarkers of selected organs of P.  viridis. Methods: <b>Green</b> <b>mussels</b> were collected from two coastal sites of Manila Bay, Las Piñas – Parañaque (LPP) and Bacoor, Cavite (BC). Twenty-four <b>green</b> <b>mussels</b> from each site were used for the assessment of allometric parameters, and six <b>green</b> <b>mussels</b> from LPP and eight from BC were used for the assessment of histological structures of gonads, gut, and digestive glands. Gonad development was categorized into five stages, whereas gut and digestive glands were scored into four categories. Results: Allometric parameters that include shell height, weight, and total wet and dry soft tissue weight were significantly different between LPP and BC. It was also observed that exposure to the pollutants in Manila Bay resulted to delays in gonadal development, and detrimental changes and lesions in the histostructure of digestive gland and gut. Conclusions: Pollutants in Manila Bay have detrimental effects to the growth, reproductive development, and histological structure of digestive organs of P. viridis...|$|R

40|$|Trace metals are {{available}} to marine bivalves through uptake from both the aqueous and dietary phases. In this study, I sought {{to determine if there}} is any interaction between these 2 exposure pathways. The uptake of Cd and Se by <b>green</b> <b>mussels</b> Perna viridis from the aqueous phase Was measured at different phytoplankton concentrations (green alga Chlorella autotrophica). Controlled experiments were performed to ensure that, in the presence of algal particles, the majority of metal accumulation by the <b>green</b> <b>mussels</b> was due to uptake from the aqueous phase. The influx rate of metals was independent of the food concentration and the clearance rate of the mussels, indicating that metal uptake from the aqueous phase was not directly related to the food concentration. These results verify the assumption that metal uptake from different exposure pathways is additive and that there is no direct interaction between different routes of exposure, Metal uptake by <b>green</b> <b>mussels</b> was further tested after exposing the mussels to neurotransmitters (serotonin which stimulates ciliary pumping and dopamine which inhibits ciliary pumping). Complete inhibition of ciliary pumping was reached after addition of 100 muM of dopamine, Despite changes in the pumping activity due to exposure to neurotransmitters, there was no evidence showing the reduction or enhancement of metal uptake. A bioenergetic-based kinetic model was then employed to model the influence of seston quantity on the exposure pathways of metals in the mussels, Our calculations indicated that the seston quantity substantially influences the relative importance of aqueous versus dietary exposure, primarily due to the dependence of a <b>green</b> <b>mussel's</b> ingestion activity on seston quantity. At a higher seston concentration, the exposure pathways are not influenced by the change in seston concentration due to the maintenance of a maximum ingestion rate and pseudofeces production...|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{perspective of}} Butyltin (BTs) contamination and its possible implications on the marine and coastal environments of the Philippines is presented using <b>green</b> <b>mussels,</b> marine mammals and skipjack tuna as bioindicators. BTs were detected in mussels {{from all the}} sampling locations investigated {{as part of the}} monitoring surveys under the Asia-Pacific Mussel Watch (APMW) Program conducted in the late 1990 s. The BTs detected in <b>green</b> <b>mussels</b> collected in 1994, 1997 and 1998 from various aquaculture and coastal sites in the country were suggestive of considerable widespread pollution by BTs in the coastal waters. Among BTs, TBT was detected at all locations at relatively higher concentrations, whereas the concentrations of DBT and MBT were found to be at lower residual concentrations. This could be indicative that <b>green</b> <b>mussels</b> have limited ability of metabolize TBT to DBT and MBT. It could also be suggestive of recent TBT inputs into the aquatic environments and the presence of sources along the coastal waters. Concentrations of BTs (MBT+DBT+TBT) in <b>green</b> <b>mussels</b> were reported up to 790 ng g 1 wet weight in a site where intensive maritime activities are occurring. Mussels from rural areas contained TBT at lower proportions indicating that TBT usage as antifouling agents is minimal. Tolerable Average Residue Level (TARL) for seafood in the Philippines was estimated at 173 ng g wet weight for an average person weighing 60 kg. Concentrations of TBT or the sum of TBT and DBT in some <b>green</b> <b>mussels</b> analysed revealed that some values exceeded TARL level, which could suggest that humans consuming this seafood from areas with high BTs contamination could be at risk from elevated exposure to BTs. BTs were likewise detected in skipjack tuna collected from the offshore waters of the Philippines, suggestive of the widespread contamination even in offshore waters. Considerable BTs levels (up to 220 ng g wet weight), with high percentages of BTs in total tin (ΣSn: inorganic tinorganic tin) were noted in the liver tissues. This finding indicates that the anthropogenic BTs represent the major source of Sn accumulation. On the other hand, relatively low concentrations of BTs were found in the liver of cetaceans from the coastal waters of the Philippines, which ranged at 42 - 98 ng g 1 wet weight. Significantly lower hepatic BT concentrations in cetaceans in tropical waters were noted compared with those inhabiting temperate waters proximal to developed nations. This result could imply that, at present, usage of BTs in the Philippines is still minimal...|$|R

50|$|The Asian <b>green</b> <b>mussel</b> has {{separate}} sexes and fertilizes externally. There are a {{very few}} functional hermaphrodites (<0.1%). The mussel's sexual development was shown {{to be affected by}} temperature. Spawning ordinarily occurs twice a year between early spring and late autumn; however, the mussels found in the Philippines and Thailand are known to spawn all year round.The zygote transforms to a larva 7-8 hours after fertilization. The larvae stay in the water column for 10-12 days before undergoing metamorphosis into a juvenile and settling onto a surface. The juveniles become sexually mature when they are 15-30 mm in length, a size reached within 2-3 months. Growth is influenced by the availability of food, temperature, water movement, mussel's age, and caging. Cage culturing can prevent entry of predators and barnacles increases marketability but slows down the mussel's growth rate. The adult can live to up 2-3 years. Due to its fast growth, it can outcompete other fouling organisms and cause changes in marine ecological relationships.|$|E
