The Planning Commission was {{a legacy of the}} Indian Independence movement, although critics said that it was slowing economic growth.

It also reduced the extent of control individual states had over their <b>financial</b> <b>allocation</b> from the union government, and unlike the planning commission, it does not have the power to allocate funds. The planning commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether the change in Illinois higher education governance structure impacted the <b>financial</b> <b>allocations</b> and to compare perceptions of board members and the chief financial officers of Illinois public universities. A survey was used to gather perceptions. The results of the survey were mixed. The majority of individuals responding perceived the change as having had a positive impact on the universities they represented. The minority expressed concerns about "mission creep," the potential loss of cohesiveness in Illinois public universities as a group, and the need for the Illinois Board of Higher Education. The <b>financial</b> <b>allocations</b> were compared by general revenue fund appropriations, university income fund appropriations, and new capital appropriations as reported in Illinois higher education Data Books. The findings indicated relatively little change in the amount that each university received. The exception was in new capital appropriations, which had no clear pattern of distribution. In conclusion, operating funds for Illinois state universities remained at the same distribution level, and the majority of persons surveyed viewed the governance change as a positive change...|$|R

The analysis reveals that both coordination and compatibility with territorial cohesion have not always improved in response to major policy reforms. The territorial â€˜vocationâ€™ of overall Community spending is weakly linked to its distribution among different policies, but it crucially depends upon appropriate â€˜place-basedâ€™ allocation mechanism...|$|R
