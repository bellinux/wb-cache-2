5000|$|CGM HLR: CGM HLR is a <b>hidden</b> <b>line</b> removal (HLR) {{solution}} from Spatial {{based on}} CATIA V6 technology. CGM HLR is an ACIS-dependent development technology - an ACIS license is required. Though 3D {{is now the}} de facto CAD standard in most engineering disciplines, 2D still has a place in industries such as technical illustration, manufacturing, and architecture. Since 3D models are the typical primary output for CAD design, users in these industries require an efficient and accurate method of generating 2D computational drawings directly from the 3D models. <b>Hidden</b> <b>line</b> removal (HLR) is {{an important aspect of}} creating an accurate 2D representation from a 3D model. Using HLR, the converted model only displays those parts visible from a given perspective; hidden (or occluded) edges normally included in a 3D model representation are removed, or drawn in a line style that indicates their obscured position.|$|E

Identification of <b>hidden</b> <b>lines</b> and junctions is essential {{in the creation of}} a complete 3 D model of the sketched object, allowing the interpretation algorithms to infer what the unsketched back of the object should look like. This approach first labels the sketched visible edges of the object with a geometric edge label, obtaining a labelled junction at each of the visible junctions of the object. Using a dictionary of junctions with visible and hidden edges, these labelled visible junctions are then used to deduce the edge interpretation and orientation of some of the hidden edges. A genetic algorithm is used to combine these hidden edges into hidden junctions, evolving the representation of the hidden edges and junctions until a feasible hidden view representation of the object is obtained. peer-reviewe...|$|R

Two algorithms, that yield good results for automatic search of observer's position in terms of orientation and for the computation of <b>hidden</b> <b>lines</b> in case of numerous segments and opaque surfaces, are presented. Some graphic examples are provided. An algorithm of previous classifying of segments and opaque surfaces is propounded. The precision of calculations and the magnitude of tolerances for parametric operations of comparison are discussed.
