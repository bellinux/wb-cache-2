5|$|The Court of Appeal {{rejected}} {{the application of}} the subjective test in favour of the objective test on the following grounds. Firstly, the Court held that Karam Singh and other cases following it were no longer good law <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> they applied Liversidge v. Anderson (1941) and Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1941), which were World War II cases from the United Kingdom. The House of Lords and the Privy Council had since recognized that the majority judgments in Liversidge and Greene had been wrong, and preferred Lord Atkin's dissenting judgment in Liversidge which advocated the objective approach.|$|E

5|$|Civil partnerships, {{introduced}} by the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar, but not equal to, those of civil marriage. The ability {{to enter into a}} civil partnership ended on 16 November 2015. Constitutional protections granted to spouses, such as the spouse of a witness not being compelled to give evidence against their spouse in most cases, is one example of protections granted under civil partnerships. Spouses may further claim privilege <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> necessary to protect the constitutional right to marital privacy. No such constitutional protections exist for civil partnerships. Further inequalities in relation to the family, immigration and other types of Irish law exist. The legislation provides rights for participants in long-term cohabiting relationships (opposite- or same-sex) who have not entered into a civil partnership or marriage. The following entry focuses primarily on the same-sex civil partnership aspect of the Act, as opposed to the cohabitation aspect.|$|E
5|$|Empiricist David Hume's {{requirement}} that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the logical positivist movement, particularly the philosopher A. J. Ayer. The movement proposed that, for {{a statement to}} hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued {{that he could not}} have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher Antony Flew proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, <b>in</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.|$|E
