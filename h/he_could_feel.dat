However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E

A handful of tweets were {{reported}} in September 2014 in which it was claimed that some viewers struggled to understand Capaldi. A speech coach and linguistics expert both suggested that any problems with understanding Capaldi {{had more to do with}} delivery than accent.|$|E

500|$|Harper {{described}} {{the extent to}} which Duvall inhabited his character: [...] "Someone once said to me, 'Well, how's Robert Duvall?' and I said, 'I don't know Robert Duvall. I know Mac Sledge very well. Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> his skin crawling up {{the back of his neck}} the first day of filming. Duvall made an effort to help Harper, who was making her film debut. While preparing to shoot a scene in which Mac and Rosa Lee fight, he yelled at a make-up artist in front of Harper to make her angry and fuel her performance; he apologized to the make-up artist after the scene was shot.|$|E

After he became Columbia University's {{president}} in 1948, Mamie requested that they finally {{have a place to}} call their own. A married couple that were friends with the Eisenhowers, George and Mary Allen, had recently purchased a small farm around Gettysburg, and recommended the area. In 1950, they found a [...] "run-down farm" [...] on the outskirts of Gettysburg, and purchased the farm and its [...] for $40,000 (equal to $ today) from one Allen Redding, who had owned the farm since 1921.

500|$|Mau {{was born}} Pius Piailug in 1932, {{in the village}} of Weiso, on the small coral island of Satawal, in Yap State of the Caroline Islands, a part of the Federated States of Micronesia. Satawal is a wooded island with an area of , located in the western Pacific Ocean about [...] south of Guam. Mau's {{personal}} connection to the sea began early in his life, when he was placed in tide pools in his infancy so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the pull of the ocean. At the age of four or five, Mau was chosen by his grandfather Raangipi to study as an apprentice navigator. Mau initially protested his grandfather's teaching, preferring to spend his time playing on the beach with children his own age. [...] Raangipi trained Mau as a young navigator for many years. Their day would begin at sunrise, when they would eat breakfast together and afterwards, take care of chores before they went fishing. During the evening, Mau would join the men in the canoe house as they drank, listening to their stories about navigation and sailing. Raangipi told the young boy that if he chose to become a navigator, Mau could gain respect from his community, eat well, and maintain a position in Satawalese society higher than that of a chief. Encouraged, Mau learned basic navigational clues regarding the [...] "stars, swells, and birds" [...] from Raangipi, but his grandfather died sometime before Mau was fourteen.|$|E
2500|$|Actress Tess Harper, who co-starred, said Duvall {{inhabited}} the character so fully that she only {{got to know}} Mac Sledge and not Duvall himself. Director Bruce Beresford, too, said the transformation was so believable to him that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> his skin crawling {{up the back of}} his neck the first day of filming with Duvall. Beresford said of the actor, [...] "Duvall has the ability to completely inhabit the person he's acting. He totally and utterly becomes that person to a degree which is uncanny." [...] Nevertheless, Duvall and Beresford did not get along well during the production and often clashed during filming, including one day in which Beresford walked off the set in frustration.|$|E

Isaac demanded that Jacob come close so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> him, but the goatskins felt just like Esau's hairy skin. Confused, Isaac exclaimed, [...] "The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau!" [...] (27:22). Still trying to get at the truth, Isaac asked him point-blank, [...] "Are you really my son Esau?" [...] and Jacob answered simply, [...] "I am" [...] (which can be taken as [...] "I am me", not [...] "I am Esau"). Isaac proceeded to eat the food and to drink the wine that Jacob gave him, and then he blessed him with the dew of the heavens, the fatness of the earth, and rulership over many nations as well as his own brother.|$|E
2500|$|As Barks blossomed creatively, his {{marriage}} to Clara deteriorated. This is the period referred to in Barks' famed quip that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> his creative juices flowing while the whiskey bottles hurled at him by a tipsy Clara flew by his head. They were divorced in 1951, his second and last divorce. In this period Barks dabbled in fine art, exhibiting paintings at local art shows. It was {{at one of these}} in 1952 he became acquainted with fellow exhibitor Margaret Wynnfred Williams (1917 – March 10, 1993), nicknamed Garé. She was an accomplished landscape artist, some of whose paintings are {{in the collection of the}} Leanin' Tree Museum of Western Art. During her lifetime, and to this day, note cards of her paintings are available from Leanin' Tree. Her nickname appears as a store name in the story [...] "Christmas in Duckburg", featured on page 1 of Walt Disney’s Christmas Parade #9, published in 1958. Soon after they met, she started assisting Barks, handling the solid blacks and lettering, both of which he had found onerous. They married in 1954 and the union lasted until her death.|$|E

2500|$|Disguised as Esau, Jacob entered Isaac's room. Surprised that Esau {{was back}} so soon, Isaac asked {{how it could}} be that the hunt went so quickly. Jacob responded, [...] "Because the LORD your God brought it to me." [...] Rashi, on [...] says Isaac's suspicions were aroused even more, because Esau never used the {{personal}} name of God. Isaac demanded that Jacob come close so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> him, but the goatskins felt just like Esau's hairy skin. Confused, Isaac exclaimed, [...] "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau!" [...] Still trying to get at the truth, Isaac asked him directly, [...] "Art thou my very son Esau?" [...] and Jacob answered simply, [...] "I am." [...] Isaac proceeded to eat the food and to drink the wine that Jacob gave him, and then told him to come close and kiss him. [...] As Jacob kissed his father, Isaac smelled the clothes which belonged to Esau and finally accepted that the person in front of him was Esau. Isaac then blessed Jacob with the blessing that was meant for Esau. Genesis 27:28–29 states Isaac's blessing: [...] "Therefore God give thee of the dew of heavens, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: [...] Let people serve thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was a clear}} {{progression}} in his development, from {{an early}} concentration on tap and musical comedy style to greater complexity using ballet and modern dance forms. Kelly himself refused to categorize his style: [...] "I don't {{have a name for}} my style of dancing...It's certainly hybrid...I've borrowed from the modern dance, from the classical, and certainly from the American folk dance – tap-dancing, jitterbugging...But I have tried to develop a style which is indigenous to the environment in which I was reared." [...] He especially acknowledged the influence of George M. Cohan: [...] "I have a lot of Cohan in me. It's an Irish quality, a jaw-jutting, up-on-the-toes cockiness – which is a good quality for a male dancer to have." [...] He was also heavily influenced by an African-American dancer, Robert Dotson, whom he saw perform at Loew's Penn Theatre around 1929. He was briefly taught by Frank Harrington, an African-American tap specialist from New York. However, his main interest was in ballet, which he studied under Kotchetovsky in the early Thirties. As biographer Clive Hirschhorn explains: [...] "As a child he used to run for miles through parks and streets and woods – anywhere, just as long as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the wind against his body and through his hair. Ballet gave him the same feeling of exhilaration, and in 1933 he was convinced it was the most satisfying form of self-expression." [...] He also studied Spanish dancing under Angel Cansino, Rita Hayworth's uncle. Generally speaking, he tended to use tap and other popular dance idioms to express joy and exuberance – as in the title song from Singin' in the Rain or [...] "I Got Rhythm" [...] from An American in Paris, whereas pensive or romantic feelings were more often expressed via ballet or modern dance, as in [...] "Heather on the Hill" [...] from Brigadoon or [...] "Our Love Is Here to Stay" [...] from An American in Paris.|$|E
