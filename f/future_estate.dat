500|$|Prior to the {{enclosure}} of Sleaford in 1794, the lands that {{later became the}} Westholme estate were mostly open fields. The largest was Puddingpan Race behind the houses on Westgate, thought to be named for the muddy puddles that formed there. That field was bounded to the north by Drove Lane, a track running to South Rauceby, {{and parts of the}} <b>future</b> <b>estate</b> also included [...] "Millgatemere Furlong" [...] to the north west and claypits to the north east. Following {{the enclosure}}, Drove Lane was straightened and moved northwards by a third of a mile; the old open fields were reorganised within this new space, producing straight, geometric boundary lines. The future Westholme grounds were divided up between several land-owners, including Lord Bristol and Benjamin Handley.|$|E

6000|$|Lydgate, {{certain that}} his patient {{wished to be}} alone, soon left him; and the black figure with hands behind and head bent forward {{continued}} to pace the walk where the dark yew-trees gave him a mute companionship in melancholy, and the little shadows of bird or leaf that fleeted across the isles of sunlight, stole along in silence as {{in the presence of}} a sorrow. Here was a man who now for the first time found himself looking into the eyes of death--who was passing through one of those rare moments of experience when we feel the truth of a commonplace, which is as different from what we call knowing it, as the vision of waters upon the earth is different from the delirious vision of the water which cannot be had to cool the burning tongue. When the commonplace [...] "We must all die" [...] transforms itself suddenly into the acute consciousness [...] "I must die--and soon," [...] then death grapples us, and his fingers are cruel; afterwards, he may come to fold us in his arms as our mother did, and our last moment of dim earthly discerning may be like the first. To Mr. Casaubon now, it was as if he suddenly found himself on the dark river-brink and heard the plash of the oncoming oar, not discerning the forms, but expecting the summons. In such an hour the mind does not change its lifelong bias, but carries it onward in imagination to the other side of death, gazing backward--perhaps with the divine calm of beneficence, perhaps with the petty anxieties of self-assertion. What was Mr. Casaubon's bias his acts will give us a clew to. He held himself to be, with some private scholarly reservations, a believing Christian, as to estimates of the present and hopes of the future. But what we strive to gratify, though we may call it a distant hope, is an immediate desire: the <b>future</b> <b>estate</b> for which men drudge up city alleys exists already in their imagination and love. And Mr. Casaubon's immediate desire was not for divine communion and light divested of earthly conditions; his passionate longings, poor man, clung low and mist-like in very shady places.|$|E
50|$|Since the 2007 United States {{recession}} one of {{the fastest}} growing sectors in the factoring industry is real estate commission advances. Commission advances work the same way as factoring but are done with licensed real estate agents on their pending and <b>future</b> real <b>estate</b> commissions. Commission advances were first introduced in Canada but quickly made its way to the United States. Typically how the commission advance process works is they apply online, sign contracts selling their <b>future</b> real <b>estate</b> commissions at a discount, and then the funds are wired to their bank account.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{assumptions about}} future prices used {{in real estate}} applications of DCF models. We confirm both the widespread reliance on an ad hoc rule of increasing period-zero capitalization rates by 50 to 100 basis points to obtain terminal capitalization rates and {{the inability of the}} rule to project <b>future</b> real <b>estate</b> pricing. To understand how investors form expectations about future prices, we model the spread between the contemporaneously period-zero going-in and terminal capitalization rates and the spread between terminal rates assigned in period zero and going-in rates assigned in period N. Our regression results confirm statistical relationships between the terminal and next holding period going-in capitalization rate spread and the period-zero discount rate, although other economically significant variables are statistically insignificant. Linking terminal capitalization rates by assumption to going-in capitalization rates implies investors view <b>future</b> real <b>estate</b> pricing with myopic expectations. We discuss alternative specifications devoid of such linkage that align more with a rational expectations view of <b>future</b> real <b>estate</b> pricing...|$|R

25|$|Another {{aim of the}} 1920 Land Commission was {{to promote}} European {{agriculture}} by curbing growing economic crops by Africans where this competed with Europeans, and by reserving for those Africans living outside the estates only as much land as was sufficient for them, making the remainder available to form small to medium size European plantations. The commission considered that 700,000 acres of Crown land was potentially available to create <b>future</b> <b>estates.</b> This was mainly outside the Shire Highlands, which contained many existing estates. The commission estimated that the African population of Nyasaland would double by 1950 but gave a very low estimate that 3.2 million acres of cultivable land and appropriate pasturage that would be sufficient to feed this anticipated future population.|$|R
5000|$|Abeyance (from the Old French abeance meaning [...] "gaping") is a {{state of}} {{expectancy}} in respect of property, titles or office, when the right to them is not vested in any one person, but awaits the appearance or determination of the true owner. In law, the term abeyance can only be applied to such <b>future</b> <b>estates</b> as have not yet vested or possibly may not vest. For example, an estate is granted to A for life, with remainder to the heir of B. During B's lifetime, the remainder is in abeyance, for until the death of B it is uncertain who is B's heir. Similarly the freehold of a benefice, on the death of the incumbent, is said to be in abeyance until the next incumbent takes possession.|$|R
