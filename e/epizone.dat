50|$|Illite {{crystallinity}} {{is useful}} {{when trying to}} determine what type of metamorphic conditions a rock was subjected to during its formation. Illite crystallinity {{can be used to}} trace the low grade metamorphic transition from zeolite facies to greenschist facies (diagenetic zone to <b>epizone).</b> This change is flagged by the change of thin illite grains to thicker illite/muscovite grains. This low grade metamorphic technique can also be put into use when there is an absence in change of mineral structure which applies to higher grade metamorphism. Early use of illite crystallinity was in the petroleum industry to determine the transition from a dry gas phase to an unproductive rock. Recently, this technique has expanded in the field and now is used in areas such as palaeotectonics and geodynamic reconstructions.|$|E
50|$|X-Ray {{diffraction}} plots {{provide information}} on angles and intensities of refracted beams which allow scientists to construct a 3D model of the crystalline structure. The focus of an illite crystallinity XRD plot is the main peak. Width of the peak at one half of its height is measured and this angle (recorded with units of ∆ °2θ), can be plotted on a chart with metamorphic zones and facies {{like the one in}} figure 1. If the illite crystallinity values fall in the 0-0.25 °2θ range, it corresponds with a metamorphic <b>epizone</b> or greenschist facies. If the illite crystallinity values fall in the 0.25-0.30 °2θ range, it corresponds with a metamorphic high anchizone or prehnite-pumpellyite facies. If the illite crystallinity values fall in the 0.30-0.42 °2θ range, it corresponds with a metamorphic low anchizone or prehnite-pumpellyite facies. If the illite crystallinity values fall in the 0.42-1.0 °2θ range, it corresponds with a metamorphic deep diagenetic zone or zeolite facies. If the illite crystallinity is > 1.0, it corresponds with a metamorphic shallow diagenetic zone or zeolite facies.|$|E
40|$|The highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (HPAI) H 5 N 1 virus has been circulating in Asia since 2003 and diversified into several genetic lineages, or clades. Although the {{spatial distribution of}} its outbreaks was extensively studied, differences in clades were never previously taken into account. We developed models to quantify associations over time and space between different HPAI H 5 N 1 viruses from clade 1, 2. 3. 4 and 2. 3. 2 and agro-ecological factors. We found that the distribution of clades in the Mekong region from 2004 to 2013 was strongly regionalised, defining specific epidemiological zones, or <b>epizones.</b> Clade 1 became entrenched in the Mekong Delta and was not supplanted by newer clades, in association with a relatively higher presence of domestic ducks. In contrast, two new clades were introduced (2. 3. 4 and 2. 3. 2) in northern Viet Nam and were associated with higher chicken density and more intensive chicken production systems. We suggest that differences in poultry production systems in these different <b>epizones</b> may explain these associations, along with differences in introduction pressure from neighbouring countries. The different distribution patterns found at the clade level would not be otherwise apparent through analysis treating all outbreaks equally, which requires improved linking of disease outbreak records and genetic sequence data.

In June 2007, ASF was confirmed in the Caucasus region of Georgia, {{and it has}} since spread to neighboring countries. DNA fragments amplified from the genome of the isolates from domestic pigs in Georgia in 2007 were sequenced and compared with other ASF virus (ASFV) isolates to establish the genotype of the virus.

Analysis of these sequences indicated that the Georgia 2007 isolate {{is closely related to}} isolates belonging to genotype II, which is circulating in Mozambique, Madagascar, and Zambia.

40|$|Abstract: The {{chemical}} compositions of micas {{from six}} well-characterised sequences have been jointly evaluated {{in order to}} analyse the behaviour of illitic substitution (SiAl – 1 !

Data from ~ 265 crystals, corresponding to 48 samples, were obtained through EDX analyses in SEM and TEM {{and the influence of}} analytical artefacts, such as contamination and alkali loss, was critically evaluated. From diagenesis to low <b>epizone,</b> the compositions of the micas are highly heterogeneous at the sample level, do not show systematic differences between grades, and include a significant illitic component, ranging from 7 interlayer cations = 0. 6 to 1. 0 a. f. u. At high <b>epizone</b> (Kübler Index < 0. 2 2 ° 2 ’), a very significant textural change is accompanied by homogenisation of the chemical composition and a reduction of the illitic component to very low values. Our data suggest continuity in the composition between illite and muscovite and do not allow us to confirm the existence of a miscibility gap in low-T environment natural samples. Some of the mica analyses reaching Si contents of around 3. 5 a. f. u. correspond to interlayercation population contents in the range of 0. 6 – 0. 7 a. f. u., indicating illitic substitution. Therefore, thermobarometry of lowtemperature phengites based only on the Si-content, without taking into account the illitic component, would result in pressure overestimates.

40|$|We report Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr {{data for}} the fine {{fractions}} of Lower Paleozoic argillaceous rocks from Wales, UK and New York, USA, spanning the range of low-grade metamorphic conditions from the diagenetic zone (zeolite facies) to the <b>epizone</b> (greenschist facies). In all cases, leaching of the fine fractions results in a high 147 Sm/ 144 Nd (0. 09 - 0. 29) acid-soluble component and a complementary low 147 Sm/ 144 Nd (0. 05 - 0. 14) residual component. The observed fractionation is an ancient feature related to diagenesis, burial and metamorphism. The magnitude of Sm-Nd fractionation between leachates and residues, {{as well as the}} resulting Sm-Nd ages, vary as a function of grain size and metamorphic grade. Uncleaved Welsh mudrocks of the diagenetic zone yield Sm-Nd leachate-residue ages of 453 - 484 Ma, in agreement with their Llanviian to Caradocian biostratigraphic ages, whereas higher grade rocks of the anchizone and <b>epizone</b> yield Sm-Nd ages as young as 413 Ma. These ages are transitional between the time of deposition and the time of regional deformation related to the Acadian Orogeny at 390 Ma. Distinct convex-upward rare earth element (REE) patterns of the leachates suggest that the precipitation of early diagenetic apatite controls the trace element budget of the rock, forcing a depletion of middle REEs on the subsequently formed diagenetic phyllosilicates. The amount of organic matter present and the extent of later prograde reactions are probable modifiers of this fractionation process. Ordovician and Devonian clastic rocks associated with the Trenton and Onondaga limestones of New York yield single-sample and multi-sample Sm-Nd isochron ages that agree well with their biostratigraphic ages of 454 Ma and 390 Ma, respectively. The REE fractionation observed in shale leachates of the Ordovician Utica Formation is related to Ca/Mg of the bulk rock and hence to the composition of the diagenetic carbonate cement.

Examination of bulk-rock chemistries indicates that most of the mineralogical changes are the result of the increasing metamorphic grade, with the exception of chloritoid; its growth does appear to be partly controlled by the rocks chemistry (it is Al 2 O 3 dependent).

40|$|High-resolution {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} (HRTEM) measurements of the thickness of white mica crystallites were made on three pelite samples that represented a prograde transition from diagenetic mudstone though anchizonal slate to epizonal slate. Crystallite thickness, measured normal to (001), increases as grade increases, whereas the XRD measured 10 Å peak-profile, the Kubler index, decreases. The mode of the TEM-measured size population can be correlated with the effective crystallite size N (001) determined by XRD. The {{results indicate that the}} Kubler index of white mica crystallinity measures changes in the crystallite size population that result from prograde increases in the size of coherent X-ray scattering domains. These changes conform to the Scherrer relationship between XRD peak broadening and small crystallite size. Lattice ‘strain’ broadening is relatively unimportant, and is confined to white mica populations in the diagenetic mudstone. Rapid increases in crystallite size occur in the anchizone, coincident with cleavage development. Changes in the distribution of crystallite thickness with advancing grade and cleavage development are characteristic of grain-growth by Ostwald ripening.

40|$|Abstract – Illite {{crystallinity}} {{data from}} the Silurian slate belts of England andWales indicate anchizone to low <b>epizone</b> metamorphism during the Acadian deformation in late Early Devonian time. This metamorphic grade implies a substantial overburden, now eroded, of Lower Devonian non-marine sediments of the Old Red Sandstone (ORS) magnafacies. A minimum 3. 5 km pre-tectonic thickness of ‘lost ’ ORS is estimated in the southern Lake District and comparable thicknesses in North Wales and East Anglia. Tectonically driven subsidence of the underlying Avalonian crust is required to accommodate such thicknesses of non-marine sediment. One proposed mechanism is flexure of the Avalonian footwall during convergence that continued from Iapetus closure in the Silurian untilAcadian cleavage formation in the Emsian. The evidence for this model in the critical area of northwest England is reviewed and found to be unconvincing. An alternative model is developed following a recent suggestion that the Early Devonian was a period not of continued convergence but of orogen-wide sinistral transtension. Transtensional accommodation of the lost ORS is evidenced by Early Devonian extensional faults, by synchronous lamprophyric magmatism, and by compatibility with previously diagnosed sediment provenance patterns.

Two juxtaposed tectonic units, the HP–LT Lungro–Verbicaro Unit (in the hanging wall) and the non-metamorphic Pollino–Ciagola Unit (in the footwall) have been analysed. For the Lungro–Verbicaro Unit, clay mineral thermal parameters and vitrinite reflectance underestimate metamorphic conditions (constrained by petrology), suggesting that, in relatively HP units, these indicators are ‘retarded’ and strongly depend on P–T evolution through time. On the other hand, the K-white mica b cell dimension provides a robust estimate of peak pressure. Fluid inclusion textures indicate a fast isothermal decompression during exhumation. Twophase inclusions from early stage syntectonic veins were trapped after isothermal exhumation at a pressure of 0. 3 GPa. For the Pollino–Ciagola Unit, the correlation of analysed parameters effectively unravels the thermal evolution, with maximum palaeotemperatures of c. 150 8 C. Apatite fission tracks provide details of the final stages of exhumation, indicating that both units were coherently exhumed in the Late Miocene, following the tectonic emplacement of the Lungro–Verbicaro Unit on top of the Pollino–Ciagola Unit...|$|E

The entry of African swine fever virus (ASFV) is dynamin-dependent and clathrin-mediated, but other pathways have been described such as macropinocytosis. During endocytosis, ASFV viral particles undergo disassembly in various compartments that the virus passes through {{en route to the}} site of replication. This disassembly relies on the acid pH of late endosomes and on microtubule cytoskeleton transport. ASFV interacts with several regulatory pathways to establish an optimal environment for replication. Examples of these pathways include small GTPases, actin-related signaling, and lipid signaling. Cellular cholesterol, the entire cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, and phosphoinositides are central molecular networks required for successful infection. Here we report new data on the conformation of the viral replication site or viral factory and the remodeling of the subcellular structures. We review the virus-induced regulation of ER stress, apoptosis and autophagy as key mechanisms of cell survival and determinants of infection outcome.

Two phases of regional metamorphism are related to their respective episodes of penetrative deformation in the southern Central Iberian Zone. The data obtained suggest that the rocks did not reach metamorphic equilibrium, but strain favoured the progress of mineral reactions in the more deformed parts. The first deformation is Devonian in age and consists in a heterogeneous ductile shearing coeval with large-scale recumbent folding that were produced under high-anchizone to <b>epizone</b> metamorphic conditions. The heterogeneity of the shearing originated strain gradients {{that can be said}} to enhance the growth of new minerals and the illite polytype transformation in the highly strained overturned limb of the preserved pile of recumbent folds, but illite crystallinity remained constant throughout the structure. The second deformation is Mid-Carboniferous in age and consists in an upright folding that took place under late diagenesis to low-anchizone metamorphic conditions. The distribution of mineral parageneses and illite crystallinity across one of the upright folds suggests that strain gradients favoured the metamorphic reaction progress from the hinge (low strain) towards the limbs (high strain).

This ductile stack was formed in an inclined left-handed transpressional zone at the North African paleomargin during Chattian to Langhian times producing two main deformational events. The first event (D-p) produced a S-p/L-p planar linear fabric generated in a noncoaxial deformation with a top-to-the-WSW sense of movement and was associated to metamorphic P-T conditions varying from late diagenesis in the southernmost Temsamane outcrops to <b>epizone</b> in the north. According to the Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 ages, this deformation occurred at Chattian-Aquitanian times. The second deformational event (D-c event) generated ENE-WSW trending folds with SSE vergence {{and a set of}} anastomosing shear zones with S-m/L-m planar linear fabric. The latter units were generated at around 15 Ma (Langhian), and indicate a strong localization of the simple shear component of the transpression. Moreover, this orientation is compatible with the kinematics of the Temsamane detachment, which can explain most of the uplift of the Temsamane rocks from the middle to the uppermost crust. The described evolution indicates that collision between the western Mediterranean terranes and the North African paleomargin and the formation of the Rifean orogenic wedge occurred at Chattian to Langhian times.

Identification of the different parameters involved in the immune response elicited against FMDV remains unclear, and it is fundamental the understanding of such parameters before effective control measures can be put in place. In the present study, we show that interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) production by dendritic cells (DCs) is drastically increased during acute infection with FMDV in swine. In vitro blockade of IL- 10 with a neutralizing antibody against porcine IL- 10 restores T cell activation by DCs. Additionally, we describe that FMDV infects DC precursors and interferes with DC maturation and antigen presentation capacity. Thus, we propose a new mechanism of virus immunity in which a non-persistent virus, FMDV, induces immunosuppression by an increment in the production of IL- 10, which in turn, reduces T cell function. This reduction of T cell activity may result in a more potent induction of neutralizing antibody responses, clearing the viral infection.

Illite (IC) and chlorite (ChC) crystallinity measurements indicate a metamorphic inversion {{between the two groups}} of mudrocks. The Windermere Supergroup mudrocks are mostly in the high anchizone or <b>epizone,</b> whereas the Ingletonian samples are lower grade in terms of IC, and are mostly deep diagenetic zone or low anchizone. Hence younger strata at higher grades rest on older strata at lower grades, creating a metamorphic inversion. Ingletonian slates exposed at Pecca Falls on the River Twiss show epizonal and anchizonal IC values, and greywacke samples from Ingleton Quarry contain pumpellyite. This suggests that grade in the Ingletonian may increase to the NW from the Horton to Ingleton inliers. K-white mica b cell dimensions show further differences between the Ingleton Group and the Windermere Supergroup. The Ingletonian samples are characterized by low b cell values (8. 989 – 9. 035, mean 9. 007 Å), whereas the Windermere Supergroup has higher values in the range 9. 022 – 9. 034, mean 9. 027 Å. The Windermere Supergroup values are similar to those recorded from the Windermere Supergroup of the southern Lake District, and Lower Palaeozoic rocks from the Scottish Southern Uplands, and are consistent with metamorphism in a low heat flow, convergent geotectonic setting. The Ingletonian b cell values suggest metamorphism in a higher heat flow setting, most likely an extensional basin. The metamorphic inversion at Horton and differences in K-white mica b cell dimensions suggest that the Ingleton Group and Windermere Supergroup strata evolved in different geotectonic settings and record two separate metamorphic events. The discovery of the metamorphic inversion at Horton provides further evidence in favour of an Ordovician rather than Neoproterozoic depositional age for the controversial Ingleton Group...|$|E

In the Antalaha area of NE Madagascar, two distinct cover sequences rest on high-grade metamorphic and igneous basement rocks of the Archaean Antongil craton and the Neoproterozoic Bemarivo belt. The older of these two cover sequences, the Andrarona Group, consists of low-grade metasedimentary rocks. The younger sequence, the newly defined Ampohafana Formation, consists of unmetamorphosed sedimentary rocks. The Andrarona Group rests on Neoarchaean granites and monzogranites of the Antongil craton and consists of a basal metagreywacke, thick quartzites and an upper sequence of sericite-chlorite meta-mudstones, meta-sandstones and a volcaniclastic meta-sandstone. The depositional age of the volcaniclastic meta-sandstone is constrained in age by U–Pb laser-ablation ICP-MS analyses of euhedral zircons to 1875 ± 8 Ma (2). Detrital zircons of Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic age represent an input from the Antongil craton and a newly defined Palaeoproterozoic igneous unit, the Masindray tonalite, which underlies the Andrarona Group, and yielded a U–Pb zircon age of 2355 ± 11 Ma (2), thus constraining the maximum age of deposition of the basal part of the Andrarona Group.

40|$|The unmetamorphosed {{equivalents}} of the regionally metamorphosed clays and marls {{that make}} up the Alpine Liassic black shale formation consist of illite, irregular mixed-layer illite/montmorillonite, chlorite, kaolinite, quartz, calcite, and dolomite, with accessory feldspars and organic material. At higher grade, in the anchizonal slates, pyrophyllite is present and is thought to have formed at the expense of kaolinite; paragonite and a mixed-layer paragonite/muscovite presumably formed from the mixed-layer illite/montmorillonite. Anchimetamorphic illite is poorer in Fe and Mg than at the diagenetic stage, having lost these elements during the formation of chlorite. Detrital feldspar has disappeared. In epimetamorphic phyllites, chloritoid and margarite appear by the reactions pyrophyllite + chlorite = chloritoid + quartz + H 2 O and pyrophyllite + calcite ± paragonite = margarite + quartz + H 2 O + CO 2, respectively. At the epi-mesozone transition, paragonite and chloritoid seem to become incompatible in the presence of carbonates and yield the following breakdown products: plagioclase, margarite, clinozoisite (and minor zoisite), and biotite. The maximum distribution of margarite is at the epizone-mesozone boundary; at higher metamorphic grade margarite is consumed by a continuous reaction producing plagioclase. Most of the observed assemblages in the anchi-and <b>epizone</b> can be treated in the two subsystems MgO (or FeO) -Na 2 O−CaO−Al 2 O 3 −(KAl 3 O 5 −SiO 2 −H 2 O−CO 2). Chemographic analyses show that the variance of assemblages decreases with increasing metamorphic grade. Physical conditions are estimated from calibrated mineral reactions and other petrographic data. The composition of the fluid phase was low in XCO 2 throughout the metamorphic profile, whereas XCH 4 was very high, particularly in the anchizone where aH 2 O was probably as low as 0. 2.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the textural {{characterization}} of very low to greenschist facies metamorphic rocks by means of a conventional X-ray source, possibly establishing a relationship between the extent of morphological orientation of mineral grains and metamorphic degree. For a long time geologists investigated the morphological orientation of mineral grains in polycrystalline rocks by means of petrographic microscope equipped with a Universal stage. More recently diffraction of conventional X-ray sources as well as diffraction (or transmission) of hard X-rays, electrons and neutrons has been applied to these kind of study. However, whereas X-ray conventional sources can be regarded as a routine technology, hard X-ray, electron and neutron sources are only available in a few facilities around the world. Phyllosilicates such as smectite, illite, muscovite, chlorite and biotite {{play a key role in}} the textural characteristics of the mineral assemblages of rocks characterized by increasing metamorphic degree. The present study is focused on the variation of the X-ray intensities of selected reflections of these phases. In short, if a morphologic orientation of the grains of a certain phyllosilicate is present, a variation of the intensity of these reflections will be measured when the rock sample is rotated in a goniometer keeping constant both the incident beam angle and the position of the detector. The samples selected for the study are the following: 1) a Ms, Chl, Qtz, Pl fine grained metapelite from Frassenetto (UD, Italy) (very low grade metamorphism, Anchizone) with some detrital muscovite flakes recognizable by their coarser grain size; 2) Ms, Chl, Qtz, Pl fine grained metapelite from Chiadenis (UD, Italy) (low grade metamorphism, <b>Epizone)</b> with some detrital muscovite flakes recognizable by their coarser grain size; 3) a Ms, Chl, Ilm, Qtz, Pl layered phyllite from Villabassa (BZ, Italy) (Greenschist facies metamorphism, Ms-Chl-Bt), with crenulated main foliation and axial planes defining a second spaced foliation; 4) a Ms, Bt, Grt, Ilm, Qtz, Pl layered phyllite from Luson (BZ, Italy) (Greenschist facies metamorphism, Ms-Bt-Grt), with crenulated main foliation and axial planes defining a second spaced foliation...|$|E
40|$|TEM and XRD {{techniques}} {{were used to}} study crystal growth characteristics of the fabric-forming phyllosilicates which developed in response to low-grade metamorphism and tectonic imbrication in part of the Southern Uplands thrust terrane. Prograde regional metamorphism, ranging from late diagenesis through the anchizone to the <b>epizone,</b> was accompanied {{by the development of}} a slaty cleavage which is commonly bedding-parallel. TEM-measured mean thicknesses of white mica and chlorite crystallite populations increase with advancing grade and correlate with XRD-measured crystallinity indices. Analytical TEM data show that prograde changes in composition lead to a net loss of Si, Ca and minor Fe from the fabric-forming phyllosilicates. White micas are paragonite-poor phengites with a mean b lattice parameter of 9. 037 Å, and indicate an intermediate pressure series of metamorphism with a field gradient of < 25 ° C km - 1. Chlorite compositions evolved from diabantite (with intergrown corrensite) to ripidolite over an estimated temperature range of 150 – 320 ° C. Field gradient and temperature estimates suggest that crystal growth and fabric development occurred at burial depths ranging from 6 km to at least 13 km in the thrust terrane. During late diagenesis, crystal growth of white mica and chlorite was predominantly a consequence of polytypic and phase transitions, and resulted in similar size distributions which resemble typical Ostwald ripening curves. Under anchizonal and epizonal conditions, white mica grew more rapidly than chlorite because of its greater ability to store strain energy and recover from subgrain development; as a result crystal thickness distributions are not typical of Ostwald ripening. In contrast, chlorite crystals which grew under these conditions developed subgrain boundaries at high strain rates which were only partially recovered at low strain rates; these retained dislocations reduce the crystallite thicknesses detected by TEM and XRD, compared with those of white mica. These differences in strain-induced crystal growth indicate that white mica (illite) and chlorite crystallinity indices are likely to show significant differences where low-grade metamorphism is closely associated with tectonic fabric development...|$|E
40|$|The {{southern}} Cantabrian Mountains expose {{sedimentary rocks}} having experienced uplift coeval with alpidic, Variscan {{and in the}} south, possibly Cadomian orogenic cycles; these rocks are referred to by their Variscan tectonic expressions: the Cantabrian Zone and Narcea Antiform. This thesis yields new experimental and geologic information from 32 AFT samples there gathered. The Cantabrian Zone, a nearly complete Palaeozoic succession has been characterised as the thin-skinned tectonism dominated arcuate foreland fold-and-thrust belt. South of the León Line fault system non-metamorphic conditions dominate, to the North anchizone to <b>epizone</b> conditions are recorded. The Narcea Antiform, unconformably overlain by the Palaeozoic succession, represents as a Neoproterozoic sedimentary basement, the Variscan foreland-hinterland transition. Metamorphic conditions increase from anchizone to greenschist facies coincident with hinterland directed increasing deformation. Unconformable and deformed, discontinuous Stephanian intramontane fills, overlay pre-Stephanian successions in both the Narcea Antiform and Cantabrian Zone. At the foreland-hinterland transition, they record anchizone to <b>epizone</b> metamorphic signatures, while those confined to the Cantabrian Zone infer lowest metamorphic grades. Experimental results show uranium concentration {{may be used in}} the absence of data for more often observed substitutions to the apatite chemical formula [Ca_ 10 (PO_ 4) _ 6 (F,Cl,OH) _ 2], to predict correlation between AFT grain-ages and their respective D_par values. Graphs constructed for AFT central-age versus latitude and elevation yield negative slopes, indicating a complex elevation dependent cooling profile affected by differential topography, recent tectonic activity and time dependent changing geomorphic conditions. AFT grain-ages from the Narcea Antiform, the Cantabrian Zone and Stephanian basins reveal thermal conditions coeval with the Variscan orogenic cycle may have been insignificant to totally anneal preexisting fission tracks. AFT grain-age subcomponents indicate AFT partial annealing zone (PAZ) conditions in the Narcea Antiform may have prevailed from as early as Neoproterozoic time. Alternatively, many pre-Stephanian Palaeozoic rocks near major structural lineaments yield AFT-age distributions completely annealed following Late Carboniferous time. Model time-Temperature (t-T) pathways for nineteen samples estimate the thermal evolution of the southern Cantabrian Mountains. Samples from the Narcea Antiform yield AFT single-grain-age cooling signatures, which when evaluated with respect to their 1 ? errors, may be interpreted to signal earliest entry into the AFT-PAZ at Neoproterozoic time, possibly coeval with subduction along Avalonian-Cadomian-Pan African magmatic arc. Pre-Stephanian cooling in Neoproterozoic samples is lowly constrained. Nevertheless pervasive cooling in these samples occurred coeval with ~ 3. 6 km of pre-Stephanian Palaeozoic sedimentation in the adjacent Cantabrian Basin. Following a latest Variscan to early post-Variscan thermal pulse to upper-PAZ conditions the Narcea Antiform experienced denudation related cooling and exited the PAZ by as early as the Middle Jurassic. Palaeozoic rocks in the southern Cantabrian Zone evidence middle to high-PAZ conditions to between Middle Triassic to Late Jurassic time. Sustained palaeothermal conditions may be associated with a) heat from a locally derived sedimentary cover of between 1 km at ~ 85 deg. C/km transitioning to that delivered by an assumed ~ 3 - 4 km at 30 deg. C/km, and/or b) the circulation of thermal convection-heated high salinity brines, possibly of Triassic age. Rapid late Mesozoic cooling to sub-PAZ conditions coeval with the far field onset of Atlantic then Biscay rift episodes, is evidenced in AFT t-T reconstructions. Late Mesozoic-early Cenozoic reheating, coeval with the transitioning interplay between late Biscay rifting, crustal subduction, onset of alpidic orogenesis and an Early Eocene fluid delivered thermal pulse are evidenced in t-T models showing low to middle-PAZ conditions. Cooling at Latest Palaeogene-Neogene time is dominated by processes associated with alpidic shortening and unroofing. A final heterogeneously delivered thermal reactivation, mostly insignificant to the AFT chronometre, occurs coeval with renewed tectonic activity along the northern Iberian margin, climaxing by latest Miocene (Messinian) time. Heterogeneous cooling of samples is evidenced from Early Pliocene time. Post-tectonic denudation is interpreted to have become the dominant infl uence of cooling in the study area. In light of the absence of extensive Mesozoic or Cenozoic covers in the southern Cantabrian Mountains, AFT t-T models present the only method for time-constrained quantitative estimation of post-Variscan cooling in NW Iberia...|$|E
40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} and specific real-time PCR method {{was developed for}} the reliable and rapid detection of African swine fever virus (ASFV). The method uses a commercial Universal Probe Library (UPL) probe combined with a spe-cifically designed primer set to amplify an ASFV DNA fragment within the VP 72 coding genome region. The detection range of the optimized UPL PCR technique was confirmed by analysis of a large panel (n = 46) of ASFV isolates, belonging to 19 of the 22 viral p 72 genotypes described. No amplification signal was observed when closely clinically related viruses, such as classical swine fever, or other porcine pathogens were tested by this assay. The detection limit of the UPL PCR method was established below 18 DNA copies. Validation experi-ments using an extensive collection of field porcine and tick samples (n = 260), coming from Eastern and Western African regions affected by ASF, demon-strated that the UPL PCR technique was able to detect over 10 % more positive samples than the real-time TaqMan PCR test recommended in the OIE manual, confirming its superior diagnostic sensitivity. Clinical material collected during experimental infections with different ASFV p 72 genotypes was useful for assur-ing both {{the capacity of the}} UPL PCR for an early viral DNA detection and the competence of the technique to be applied in any ASF diagnostic target sample. The reliability and robustness of the UPL PCR was finally verified with a panel of ASFV-infected clinical samples which was repeatedly tested at different times. Additionally, an internal control PCR assay was also developed and standard-ized using UPL probes within the endogenous b-actin gene. Finally, the com-plete study offers a new validated real-time PCR technique, by means of a standardized commercial probe, providing a simple, rapid and affordable test, which is ready for application in the routine diagnosis of ASF.

40|$|Background: Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) causes an {{economically}} important and highly contagious disease of cloven-hoofed animals. FMD control in endemic regions is implemented using chemically inactivated whole-virus vaccines. Currently, efforts are {{directed to the}} development of safe and marked vaccines. We have previously reported solid protection against FMDV conferred by branched structures (dendrimeric peptides) harbouring virus-specific B and T-cell epitopes. In order to gain insights into the factors determining a protective immune response against FMDV, in this report we sought to dissect the immunogenicity conferred by different peptide-based immunogens. Thus, we have assessed the immune response and protection elicited in pigs by linear peptides harbouring the same FMDV B-cell or B and T-cell epitopes (B and TB peptides, respectively). Results: Pigs were twice immunized with either the B-cell epitope (site A) peptide or with TB, a peptide where the B-cell epitope was in tandem with the T-cell epitope [3 A (21 - 35) ]. Both, B and TB peptides were able to induce specific humoral (including neutralizing antibodies) and cellular immune responses against FMDV, but did not afford full protection in pigs. The data obtained showed that the T-cell epitope used is capable to induce efficient T-cell priming that contributes to improve the protection against FMDV. However, the IgA titres and IFNγ release elicited by these linear peptides were lower than those detected previously with the dendrimeric peptides. Conclusions: We conclude that the incorporation of a FMDV specific T-cell epitope in the peptide formulation allows a significant reduction in virus excretion and clinical score after challenge. However, the linear TB peptide did not afford full protection in challenged pigs, as that previously reported using the dendrimeric construction indicating that, besides the inclusion of an adecuate T-cell epitope in the formulation, an efficient presentation of the B-cell epitope is crucial to elicit full protection by peptide vaccines.

40|$|Background] New vaccine {{designs are}} needed to control {{diseases}} associated with antigenically variable RNA viruses. Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of livestock that inflicts severe economic losses. Although the current whole-virus chemically inactivated vaccine has proven effective, {{it has led to}} new outbreaks of FMD because of incomplete inactivation of the virus or the escape of infectious virus from vaccine production premises. We have previously shown that serial passages of FMD virus (FMDV) C-S 8 c 1 at high multiplicity of infection in cell culture resulted in virus populations consisting of defective genomes that are infectious by complementation (termed C-S 8 p 260). [Principal Finding] Here we evaluate the immunogenicity of C-S 8 p 260, first in a mouse model system to establish a proof of principle, and second, in swine, the natural host of FMDV C-S 8 c 1. Mice were completely protected against a lethal challenge with FMDV C-S 8 c 1, after vaccination with a single dose of C-S 8 p 260. Pigs immunized with different C-S 8 p 260 doses and challenged with FMDV C-S 8 c 1 either did not develop any clinical signs or showed delayed and mild disease symptoms. C-S 8 p 260 induced high titers of both FMDV-specific, neutralizing antibodies and activated FMDV-specific T cells in swine, that correlated with solid protection against FMDV. [Conclusions] The defective virus-based vaccine did not produce detectable levels of transmissible FMDV. Therefore, a segmented, replication-competent form of a virus, such as FMDV C-S 8 p 260, can provide the basis {{of a new generation of}} attenuated antiviral vaccines with two safety barriers. The design can be extended to any viral pathogen that encodes trans-acting gene products, allowing complementation between replication-competent, defective forms.

40|$|Upper Triassic bedded {{evaporite}} sulfate of the Burano Formation outcropping at Cerreto Pass between Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna in the Northern Apennines {{were analyzed}} for sulfur and oxygen isotope compositions, yielding d 34 S and d 18 O values of 15. 5 ± 0. 4 ‰ and 10. 8 ± 1. 2 ‰, respectively (mean ± 99 % confidence intervals). Combining these values {{with those of}} other Burano Formation sulfate deposits along the Apennine chain, mean for d 34 S and d 18 O values are obtained (15. 2 ± 0. 2 ‰ and 10. 9 ± 0. 5 ‰, respectively). These isotopic signatures are interpreted as preserved primary features, {{despite the fact that the}} Burano Formation underwent anchizone to <b>epizone</b> metamorphism during the Apennine orogenesis. An overall d 18 O value of 10. 9 ± 1. 5 ‰ (mean ± pooled standard deviation), obtained by combining consistent sets of data from Italy and Spain, closely approaches that of gypsum deposited from the Tethys ocean during the Late Triassic. In addition, reviewing the isotope data published on Late Triassic evaporite sulfates from the Mediterranean area and abroad, several d 34 S values appear to be lower than the inferred primary isotopic signature, and seemly decrease from East to West in the Mediterranean region, suggesting a similar trend for the Tethys ocean sulfate. Possibly, 34 S-depleted sulfate entered the ocean through oxidation of volcanic SO 2 emitted in the atmosphere and degassed from the seafloor during the development of Late Triassic rifting. On the other hand, positive shifts of d 34 S and d 18 O values also occur, defining a common trend that may be related to synsedimentary biological effects or post-depositional metasomatic-metamorphic effects, the latter affecting particularly the d 18 O signature. Therefore, the d 34 S and d 18 O signatures of evaporite sulfate may provide a like “slide-rule” diagram to distinguish between isotopic effects related to biological or abiological processes, thus contributing to the reconstruction of paleoenvironments and paleogeographic settings. Based on the d 34 S-d 18 O “slide-rule”, the isotopic composition of sulfate dissolved in spring and stream waters of northern Tuscany was interpreted in terms of origin of the sulfate and modifying processes in solution. It was concluded that sulfate in springs derives from Upper Triassic evaporite existing locally at depth (Burano Formation), whereas sulfate in streams is manifestly a mixture of Burano Formation sulfate with supergene sulfate from oxidation of sulfide in the rocks. In sulfurous springs, both sulfur and oxygen isotope fractionations with respect to the source sulfate signatures may be ascribed to bacterial effects. However, the oxygen isotope exchange of sulfate with water should have been a very minor process as supported by the nearsurface temperature values estimated by sulfate-water oxygen isotope thermometry...|$|E
40|$|The Cantabrian Zone in NW Spain {{represents}} the foreland fold and thrust belt of the Variscan orogen, formed by Precambrian basement covered by an almost complete succession of Palaeozoic sediments, mostly deposited on a passive margin. Most of the succession underwent deformation {{with almost no}} internal strain (Pastor-Galán et al., 2009), and in most areas with only a diagenetic overprint. This includes, however, several thermal events (only locally up to the <b>epizone)</b> and different episodes of fluid flow. One of these epigenetic fluid flow events produced pervasive dolomitization {{on a large scale}} covering over 1000 km 2 in todays outcrops. The present research focused on this post-orogenic hydrothermal dolomitization, which strongly increased porosity and permeability in large volumes of rocks. It affected mainly Carboniferous but to a smaller degree also older carbonate successions. Earlier research (Gasparrini et al., 2006; Lapponi et al., 2007) concentrated on the type of dolomite and its geochemical and isotopic characteristics, as well as the fluids generating this dolomite (very saline, originally evaporitic brines with elevated temperature). Of special interest was the timing of dolomitization (latest Carboniferous/earliest Permian) and the relation with the geodynamic setting: dolomitization was associated, at least time wise, with the bending of the Cantabrian Arch (see Gutiérrez-Alonso et al., 2004; Weil et al., 2013) related with a lithospheric delamination-induced thermal event. These main results were confirmed by this research. The investigated area was distinctly extended compared with the mentioned earlier research. A study of petrophysical properties, geochemistry and fluid inclusions was carried out, in relation to the characterization of the dolomite bodies and the structural setting. Of special interest was the amount, types and regional distribution of porosity and permeability. Various parameters such as crystal size, orientation of the porosity in relation to dolomite textures and fabrics, and eventual rhythmicity of pore space are used to identify regional dolomitization patterns The data from the investigated outcrops within the large area of research serve to outline areas of increased porosity and permeability. The latter favourable factors might allow to predict locations of dolomite reservoirs with enhanced porosity elsewhere. Large bodies of hydrothermal dolomite were favoured by: (i) a restricted and large reservoir of highly evaporated sea water; (ii) intense fracturing acting as fluid flow pathways; and (iii) a high thermal gradient enhancing convectional fluid flow. Positive petrophysical properties are affected by specific dolomite fabrics (Zebra, Vuggy, and Non Macro Porous), over-dolomitization reduced dramatically porosity. The outermost western region of the Cantabrian Orocline provides a combination of the most positive factors for potential dolomite hydrocarbon reservoirs. Here the dolomite bodies are large, petrophysical properties are favourable, fracturation intensity is high and over-dolomitization is low...|$|E
40|$|A {{review is}} given of {{recently}} published and new data on Avalonia {{east of the}} Midlands Microcraton. The three megasequences from Cambrian to mid Devonian described in Wales and Welsh Borderland are also present east of the Midlands Microcraton (Brabant Massif, Condroz, Ardennes, Remscheid and Ebbe inliers, Krefeld high). The three mega-sequences are caused by a tectonic driving mechanism and are explained by three different geodynamic contexts: an earlier phase with extensional basins or rifting and rather thick sequences, when Avalonia was still attached to Gondwana; a second phase with a shelf basin with moderately thin sequences when Avalonia was a separate continent and a later phase with a shelf or foreland basin development and thick sequences. Deformation of the megasequences 1 and 2 or 1 to 3 varies between areas. In Wales and the Lake District the Acadian phase is long-lived and active from early to mid Devonian. In the Ardennes inliers a deformation is active between the late Ordovician and the Silurian (Ardennian Phase), with a similar intensity as {{the core of the}} Brabant Massif, when present erosion levels are compared. The Brabant Massif is partly deformed by the long-lived Brabantian Phase from late Silurian till early mid Devonian. Both the Ardennes inliers and the Brabant Massif are not classic orogenic belts, only slate belts where no more than the <b>epizone</b> is reached at present erosion levels. Areas supposedly close to the microcraton or basement are nearly undeformed (SW Brabant Massif and central Condroz). A model of anticlockwise rotation of Avalonia of about 55 ° from Caradoc to Emsian is proposed to explain the deposition setting of megasequence 3 and the subsequent Acadian and Brabantian deformation. Immediately after the Avalonian microcontinent touched Baltica in Caradoc times it created a short-lived subduction magmatic event from The Wash to the Brabant Massif and soon after the magmatism ended a foreland basin developed. Possibly during and after that development a long-lived and slow compressional event occurred, leading to the deformation of the Anglo-Brabant Deformation Belt. In the early Devonian, contemporaneous with the shortening of the Anglo-Brabant Deformation Belt, extension occurred in the Rheno-Hercynian Zone, possibly caused by the same slow rotation of Avalonia. More evidence emerges that Avalonia cast of the Midlands Microcraton comprises not one but probably two terranes: the remnant of the palaeocontinent Avalonia, and what is called the palaeocontinent Far Eastern Avalonia; the latter is only occasionally observed in the few deep boreholes into the Heligoland-Pomerania Deformation Belt, in southern Denmark, NE Germany and NW Poland, with scant available indirect data in between indicating only Proterozoic basement and no Caledonian deformation. For Far Eastern Avalonia a similar palaeogeographical history is postulated as Avalonia, with rifting from Gondwana in Arenig or earlier times, collision with Baltica before the mid-Ashgill and deformation between the late Ordovician and latest Silurian. The Avalonia concept might need to be expanded to an 'Avalonian Terrane Assemblage' with cratonic cores and small short-lived oceans as in the Armorican Terrane Assemblage.

40|$|Fluid {{inclusions}} in quartz {{veins of}} the High-Ardenne slate belt have preserved remnants of prograde and retrograde metamorphic fluids. These fluids were examined by petrography, microthermometry and Raman analysis {{to define the}} chemical and spatial evolution of the fluids that circulated through the metamorphic area of the High-Ardenne slate belt. The earliest fluid type was a mixed aqueous/gaseous fluid (H 2 O NaCl-CO 2 -(CH 4 -N- 2)) occurring in growth zones and as isolated fluid inclusions in both the epizonal and anchizonal part of the metamorphic area. In {{the central part of}} the metamorphic area (<b>epizone),</b> in addition to this mixed aqueous/gaseous fluid, primary and isolated fluid inclusions are also filled with a purely gaseous fluid (CO 2 -N- 2 -CH 4). During the Variscan orogeny, the chemical composition of gaseous fluids circulating through the Lower Devonian rocks in the epizonal part of the slate belt, evolved from an earlier CO 2 -CH 4 -N- 2 composition to a later composition enriched in N- 2. Finally, a late, Variscan aqueous fluid system with a H 2 O-NaCl composition migrated through the Lower Devonian rocks. This latest type of fluid can be observed in and outside the epizonal metamorphic part of the High-Ardenne slate belt. The chemical composition of the fluids throughout the metamorphic area, shows a direct correlation with the metamorphic grade of the host rock. In general, the proportion of non-polar species (i. e. CO 2, CH 4, N- 2) with respect to water and the proportion of non-polar species other than CO? increase with increasing metamorphic grade within the slate belt. In addition to this spatial evolution of the fluids, the temporal evolution of the gaseous fluids is indicative for a gradual maturation due to metamorphism in {{the central part of the}} basin. In addition to the maturity of the metamorphic fluids, the salinity of the aqueous fluids also shows a link with the metamorphic grade of the host-rock. For the earliest and latest fluid inclusions in the anchizonal part of the High-Ardenne slate belt the salinity varies respectively between 0 and 3. 5 eq. wt% NaCl and between 0 and 2. 7 eq. wt% NaCl, while in the epizonal part the salinity varies between 0. 6 and 17 eq. wt% NaCl and between 3 and 10. 6 eq. wt% for the earliest and latest aqueous fluid inclusions, respectively. Although high salinity fluids are often attributed to the original sedimentary setting, the increasing salinity of the fluids that circulated through the Lower Devonian rocks in the High-Ardenne slate belt can be directly attributed to regional metamorphism. More specifically the salinity of the primary fluid inclusions is related to hydrolysis reactions of Cl-bearing minerals during prograde metamorphism, while the salinity of the secondary fluid inclusions is rather related to hydration reactions during retrograde metamorphism. The temporal and spatial distribution of the fluids in the High-Ardenne slate belt are Indicative for a closed fluid flow system present in the Lower Devonian rocks during burial and Variscan deformation, where fluids were in thermal and chemical equilibrium with the host rock. Such a closed fluid flow system is confirmed by stable isotope study of the veins and their adjacent host rock for which uniform 6180 values of both the veins and their host rock demonstrate a rock-buffered fluid flow system. status: publishe...|$|E
