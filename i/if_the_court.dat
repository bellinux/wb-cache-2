5|$|A more narrow bail-in process {{pertaining}} to federal observer certification is prescribed in Section 3(a). Under this provision, {{a federal court}} may certify a non-covered jurisdiction to receive federal observers <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> determines that the jurisdiction violated the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments.

5|$|The Court's {{right to}} give damages was reiterated in Phelps v Prothero in 1855, where the Court of Appeal in Chancery held {{that if a}} {{plaintiff}} starts an action {{in a court of}} equity for specific performance and damages are also appropriate, the court of equity may choose to award damages. This authorisation was limited to certain circumstances, and was again not regularly used. Eventually, the Chancery Amendment Act 1858 gave the Court full jurisdiction to award damages; the situation before that was so limited that lawyers at the time commented as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> had not previously been able to do so.|$|E
5|$|Veltmann {{scored a}} {{victory at the}} {{beginning}} of his defense: he moved and was granted that each officer's testimony could only be applied to the men they had specifically named as having been given the order to work.

5|$|The {{penalty is}} a fine not {{exceeding}} S$5,000 and, {{in the case of}} a second or subsequent conviction, a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or both.

5|$|Once leave is granted, an {{applicant}} {{moves on to}} the second stage and applies for a prerogative order by filing in the High Court a document called a summons within the legal proceedings already started earlier. This must be done between eight and 14 days after leave {{to do so is}} granted by the Court; beyond that, the leave lapses. The applicant must serve the ex parte originating summons, the statement, the supporting affidavit, the order granting leave, and the summons by which the prerogative order is actually applied for, on all persons directly affected. Where the application relates to court proceedings and is intended to compel the court or a court official to do an act relating to the proceedings, or to quash the proceedings or any order made in them, the documents must be served on the registrar of the court and the other parties to the proceedings. The documents must also be served on the judge if his or her conduct is being objected to. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> is of opinion that any person who ought to have been served with the documents has not been served, the Court may adjourn the hearing on such terms as it may direct in order that the documents may be served on that person.|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> interprets a statute to impose a duty on a public authority, the resources available to the authority are irrelevant to deciding how the duty should be carried out. Conversely, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> interprets a statute to confer a discretionary power on a public authority, then resources are a relevant consideration. Also, public authorities are not required to take into account people's fundamental rights arising under the Human Rights Act 1998 as relevant considerations before arriving at decisions. Their only responsibility is to ensure that the decision itself complies with the European Convention on Human Rights. At present, there are no Singapore cases on these issues.|$|E
