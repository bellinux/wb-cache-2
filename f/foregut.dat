30|$|A {{link between}} RA and SM {{at the onset}} of lung {{development}} was first suspected from the analysis of genome-wide of <b>foreguts,</b> which showed an intriguing upregulation of genes associated with SM differentiation in RA-deficient <b>foreguts</b> compared to the RA-sufficient controls. These genes included alpha SM actin (Acta 2), cysteine- and glycine-rich proteins 1 and 2 (Csrp 1 and Csrp 2), transgelin (Tagln), myosin, heavy chain 11, smooth muscle (Myh 11). Subsequent analysis showed that expression of these genes was also markedly enhanced in lung explants or lung mesenchymal cells in which RA signaling was disrupted by RAR antagonist [14]. Confirmation of this RA-SM regulation in vivo was provided by evidence that restricting maternal vitamin A dietary intake during initiation of airway development resulted in aberrant overly differentiated and ectopic distribution of SM in these airways.|$|R
5000|$|Crabs are {{typically}} scavengers, {{meaning that they}} eat whatever they can find, and as omnivores this includes both plants and other animals. In a study conducted on seaweed crabs living {{on the coast of}} the South Island of New Zealand, the <b>foreguts</b> were opened among a sample of crabs to determine what foods had been consumed. Algae, including calcareous red algae and branched brown algae, was identified as the most commonly eaten substance, as it was found in nearly all of the crabs sampled. Other common foods included isopods, amphipods, and decapods (e.g. small fish, crayfish, other crabs). Bivalves, sponges, bryozans, and more were consumed as well but not commonly. Meat consumed is usually from dead animals because seaweed crabs are slow moving and not very strong.|$|R
40|$|Cynodon dactylon (Poaceae) leaf pieces {{recovered}} from the frass of final-instar Paratrytone melane larvae (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae) were composed of 14 – 22 percent crushed cells and 78 – 86 percent uncrushed cells, yet approximate digestibilities of soluble carbohydrates and protein averaged 78 and 88 percent, respectively. Therefore, nutrients from uncrushed cells were extracted by P. melane. The ability of P. melane and another leaf-snipping lepidopteran, Pseudaletia unipuncta (Noctuidae), to digest the contents of uncrushed bundle sheath and mesophyll cells in C. dactylon was examined with transmission electron microscopy. Organelles and plasma membranes were digested in the <b>foreguts</b> and midguts of both species. These findings suggest that nutrients in uncrushed leaf cells may be extracted through plasmodesmata and cell wall pores after membranes are digested. The generality of leaf-snipping, vis-a-vis leaf crushing, among larval Lepidoptera was assessed by surveying the mandible morphologies of 202 species. In 82 percent of the species surveyed only incisor regions were present. I conclude that leaf-snipping is a common mode of feeding among phytophagous Lepidoptera and that the digestion of cell contents is efficient {{despite the fact that}} few of the cells of ingested plant tissues are crushed...|$|R

40|$|The glassy-winged {{sharpshooter}} (GWSS) {{is an important}} vector of Xylella fastidiosa (Xf), the bacterial pathogen that causes several economically important plant diseases, including citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC), oleander leaf scorch (OLS) and Pierce’s disease (PD) of grapevines. In recent {{years there has been}} an increasing interest in the potential use of biological control agents to halt the spread of Xf. One such strategy is the exploration of symbiotic microorganisms to reduce the spread of the pathogen (symbiotic control). In a symbiotic control strategy a bacterium symbiont that occupies the same niche as the pathogen must be identified. The study of the bacterial community of GWSS <b>foreguts</b> by isolation and DGGE revealed the presence of several potential symbiotic candidates such as Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Methylobacterium sp. and Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens (C. flaccumfaciens). Members of genus Methylobacterium and C. flaccumfaciens are frequently isolated as endophytes from citrus plants with CVC symptoms and without disease symptoms. Recently, an interaction between Methylobacterium, C. flaccumfaciens and Xf was strongly indicated, reinforcing that these bacteria could interact inside the host plant and vector insect. In the future, the genus Methylobacterium and C. flaccumfaciens could be an interesting candidate in a strategy of symbiotic control to Xf...|$|R

The gut content of shrimp was analyzed and the flow of the food web was traced using stable carbon isotope (Î´C) analysis. Twelve 500 -m 2 ponds were stocked with juvenile shrimp (average weight 0. 8 g) and grown for 3 months at the rate of 4000 ha âˆ’ 1. In Ruppia and plankton ponds, the shrimp attained 91 â€“ 92 % survival, and in lumut and lablab ponds, 76 â€“ 80 %.

40|$|The diets of larval Rhyacophilidae (Rhyacophila inculta), Polycentropodidae (Polycentropus variegatus) and Arctopsychidae (Parapsyche almota and P. elsis) {{from five}} streams in the University of British Columbia Research Forest, British Columbia (Canada), are {{recorded}} {{and related to}} feeding mode/constructional activities and prey representation in the habitat. Particular {{attention was paid to}} the extent of dietary overlap and the degree of intraspecific dietary variations between streams. An overall similarity of the diets of the study species was notable and all commonly consumed chironomid (Diptera) larvae, Simulium (Diptera) and Zapada (Plecoptera), although there was interspecific variation in the relative importance of these items. Polycentropus variegatus and Parapsyche spp. ate Baetis and Paraleptophlebia, the latter predators also consuming Hydrachnellae (Acarina). Other prey were generally of minor importance and consequently interspecific dietary overlaps were high. Differences in the range of prey consumed by predaceous Trichoptera were apparent. Free-foraging R. inculta which selectively consumed sedentary simuliid larvae had the narrowest niche breadth. Parapsyche spp. and Polycentropus variegatus <b>foreguts</b> generally contained an over-representation of chironomid larvae compared to their proportionate occurrence in the benthos, and these caddisflies exhibited high niche overlap. The relative importance of chironomids as food for Parapsyche spp. and Polycentropus variegatus is attributed to prey behaviour, i. e. drift, and poorly developed escape responses when they are caught on the predator's net. © 1988 Dr W.

5|$|The main {{structure}} of an insect's digestive {{system is a}} long enclosed tube called the alimentary canal, which runs lengthwise through the body. The alimentary canal directs food unidirectionally from the mouth to the anus. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the <b>foregut.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{central nervous}} system {{consists}} of a brain and paired ventral nerve cords that connect to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. The brain is a ring of four ganglia, masses of nerve cells, positioned round the rhynchocoel near its front end – while the brains of most protostome invertebrates encircle the <b>foregut.</b> Most nemertean species have just one pair of nerve cords, many species have additional paired cords, and some species also have a dorsal cord. In some species the cords lie within the skin, but in most they are deeper, inside the muscle layers. The {{central nervous system}} is often red or pink because it contains hemoglobin. This stores oxygen for peak activity or when the animal experiences anoxia, for example while burrowing in oxygen-free sediments.|$|E

The rhynchocoel of class Anopla has an orifice a little to the front of the mouth, but still under the front of the body. In the other class, Enopla, the mouth and the front of the rhynchocoel share an orifice. The rhynchocoel is a coelom, as it is lined by epithelium.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{morphology}} {{of stomach}} ossicles of decapod crustaceans provides valuable {{information on their}} phylogeny and biology.

Five specimens each of S. pictus and V. serrata were selected for morphological analysis of gastric ossicles. The stomachs were obtained after removing the carapace, and they were fixed in 10 % formalin for 24 hours. After this procedure, the stomachs were immersed in a solution of 10 % Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) and heated to 100 °C during 60 minutes for tissue maceration. At this point, the clean skeletons were colored by adding 1 % Alizarin Red to the KOH solution {{in order to facilitate}} visualization of the internal structures such as the setae and ossicles. The ten new ossicles are: dorsomedial cardiac plate; dorsolateral cardiac plate; suprapectineal lateral ossicle; inferior cardiac valve; lateral mesopyloric ossicle; ampullary roof-medium portion ossicle; process of the ampullary roof-upper portion; lateral-inferior post-ampullary plate; pleuro-pyloric valve’s ossicle; and lateral pleuro-pyloric plate.

40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of Xylella fastidiosa in Europe and its {{involvement in the}} Olive Quick Decline Syndrome (OQDS) in Apulia (Salento, Lecce district, South Italy) led us to investigate the biology and transmission ability of the meadow spittlebug, Philaenus spumarius, which was recently demonstrated to transmit X. fastidiosa to periwinkle plants. Four xylem-sap-feeding insect species were found within and bordering olive orchards across Salento during a survey carried out from October 2013 to December 2014 : P. spumarius was the most abundant species on non-olive vegetation in olive orchards {{as well as on}} olive foliage and was the only species that consistently tested positive for the presence of X. fastidiosa using real-time PCR. P. spumarius, whose nymphs develop within spittle on weeds during the spring, are likely to move from weeds beneath olive trees to olive canopy during the dry period (May to October 2014). The first X. fastidiosa-infective P. spumarius were collected in May from olive canopy: all the individuals previously collected on weeds tested negative for the bacterium. Experiments demonstrated that P. spumarius transmitted X. fastidiosa from infected to uninfected olive plants. Moreover, P. spumarius acquired X. fastidiosa from several host plant species in the field, with the highest acquisition rate from olive, polygala and acacia. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed bacterial cells resembling X. fastidiosa in the <b>foreguts</b> of adult P. spumarius.

5|$|The {{salivary glands}} (element 30 in {{numbered}} diagram) in an insect's mouth produce saliva. The salivary ducts {{lead from the}} glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium, located behind the hypopharynx. By moving its mouthparts (element 32 in numbered diagram) the insect can mix its food with saliva. The mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth, where it begins to break down. Some insects, like flies, have extra-oral digestion. Insects using extra-oral digestion expel digestive enzymes onto their food to break it down. This strategy allows insects to extract {{a significant proportion of}} the available nutrients from the food source. The gut is where almost all of insects' digestion takes place.

5|$|Many {{blood vessels}} serve the {{esophagus}}, with blood supply varying along its course.

The venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus. The upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, {{with the exception of the}} left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Lymphatically, the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes.

Natural enemies, capable of killing A. lusitanicus, may be important to our understanding of its population dynamics in recently invaded regions. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to study predation on A. lusitanicus by carabid beetles in the field. A first multiplex PCR was developed, incorporating species-specific primers, and optimised in order to amplify parts of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox 1) gene of large Arion slugs, including A. lusitanicus from the gut contents of the predators. A second multiplex PCR, targeting 12 S rRNA mtDNA, detected predation on smaller Arion species and the field slug Deroceras reticulatum. Feeding trials were conducted to measure the effects of digestion time on amplicon detectability. The median detection times (the time at which 50 % of samples tested positive) for A. lusitanicus and D. reticulatum DNA in the <b>foreguts</b> of Carabus nemoralis were 22 h and 20 h, respectively. Beetle activity-densities were monitored using pitfall traps, and slug densities were estimated using quadrats. Predation rates on slugs in the field by C. nemoralis in spring ranged from 16 – 39 % (beetles positive for slug DNA) and were density dependent, with numbers of beetles testing positive being positively correlated with densities of the respective slug species. Carabus nemoralis was shown to be a potentially important predator of the alien A. lusitanicus in spring and may contribute to conservation biological control...|$|R
40|$|Xylella fastidiosa is a xylem-limited, insect {{transmitted}} bacterium {{that causes}} fatal diseases in economically important crops, most notably, Pierce’s disease of grapevine. Due to its unique dual lifestyle, X. fastidiosa utilizes different mechanisms to facilitate colonization of its plant and insect hosts. While {{research has focused}} heavily {{on the role of}} surface-associated proteins, we establish the major cell surface carbohydrate, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as an important bacterial virulence factor and modulator of innate immunity in grapevine. We focused our attention on the terminal O antigen moiety of the LPS molecule, which serves as a key point of contact between potential hosts and the environment. Biochemical and structural analysis identified the major O antigen polysaccharide as a linear α 1 - 2 linked rhamnan polymer. By targeting an O antigen polymerase (Wzy), we found that loss of the rhamnose-rich O antigen considerably altered bacterial adhesion dynamics in the blue-green sharpshooter vector. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that this defect in initial attachment compromised subsequent biofilm formation within vector <b>foreguts,</b> thus impairing pathogen acquisition. During the plant host-pathogen interaction, successful pathogens must overcome plant immune responses to establish and cause disease. Due to the fact that X. fastidiosa lacks the quintessential type III secretion system, and its arsenal of effectors, we sought to determine the contribution of O antigen to this complex biological process. Using RNAseq, we found that in intact cells, O antigen functions as a shield; this allows X. fastidiosa to delay early recognition by the grapevine immune system, thus promoting bacterial survival and the establishment of infection. The results presented in this dissertation provide a comprehensive understanding of the composition and structure of this major cell surface polysaccharide and offer valuable insight into its diverse functions. Specifically, the studies detailing the implication of O antigen in the evasion of basal defense responses in grapevine present a novel and unprecedented mechanism employed by this unique xylem-dwelling bacterial pathogen...|$|R
30|$|Starting from 2010, on {{the west}} coast of Salento area (Lecce province, {{southern}} Italy), symptoms of the so-called CoDiRO “Olive Quick Decline Syndrome” were observed (i.e., leaf scorching, twig and branch wilting, tree die-back) [1]. Subsequently, the syndrome spread over many hectares of olive trees causing dramatic effects and currently it represents a serious local emergence [2]. Xylella fastidiosa is a Gram-negative bacterium member of the Xanthomonadaceae (γ-proteobacteria) which colonizes the xylem of host plants and the <b>foreguts</b> of insect vectors [3]. This plant pathogen was recently found associated with the CoDiRO [4, 5]. X. fastidiosa infects a wide range of host plants, such as grapevine, almond, blueberry, cherry, peach, coffee, and citrus trees, causing great economic losses mainly in North, Central and South America [6]. The pathogen is also known to infect landscape and ornamental trees such as oak, maple, and oleander [4]. The introduction of latently infected ornamental plants from Central America was reported as the venue for the subsequent spread of the pathogen in Salento [7]. The main symptoms associated with infections of X. fastidiosa are the marginal and or apical leaf scorching, twig and branch die-back and plant death [3]. The symptoms have been attributed to prolonged water stress caused by bacterium growth and biofilm formation in the xylem vessels [8]. The negative socioeconomic impact of X. fastidiosa infection in North and South America (i.e., USA and Brazil) and now in Italy is well known. In the latter case, the negative impact is due not only to relevant economic losses, but also to the dramatic effect on the typical cultural heritage represented by olive trees. Apulian 1000 -year-old olive trees are protected as local patrimony and considered a symbol of the local identity, also for their massive presence in the territory. Moreover, six over a number of 60  mln of olive trees were classified as monumental, as resulted from the first olive tree census in the whole Apulia region [9]. For these reasons, when implementing a specific control method in order to contain the further disease spread, it is important to study also its social and cultural acceptability as well as its socioeconomic impact [10]. Therefore, the need to adopt specific agronomic and phytosanitary measures to improve the vegetative state of the plants has been recently raised. For these reasons, the study of the CoDiRO effects on symptomatic olive trees by using the NMR-based metabolomics approach was carried out. In this study, we analyzed the effects of a CE approved fertilizer, known as DENTAMET® (i.e., a mixture of zinc and copper complex with hydracids of citric acid [11]) sprayed on symptomatic olive trees located in Salento. This fertilizer can be considered as a product with a dual action formulation by which the correction of Zn and Cu deficiencies occurs very quickly, as well as a resistance is induced by the cyclic peptide resembling the chemical structure of several antimicrobial substances released from the plant in response to different stresses. Thanks to the low environmental impact and few restrictions on its use, DENTAMET® is allowed for organic farming and commercialized in more than 30 countries in the world [11].|$|R

40|$|Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is an {{extremely}} potent neurotoxin that acts by selectively targeting voltage gated sodium channels blocking propagation of action potentials. Long believed to be present only in pufferfish, TTX has now been detected {{in a wide range}} of phylogenetically unrelated terrestrial and aquatic taxa. Despite decades of research the exact origin of TTX remains a mystery. Current literature supports three hypotheses: endogenous, symbiotic bacteria, or bioaccumulation through a dietary source. In 2009, the opisthobranch Pleurobranchaea maculata (grey side-gilled sea slug) was found to contain high concentrations of TTX in New Zealand. A large collaborative project, of which my research was a major part of, was initiated to explore the origin of TTX in P. maculata. During extensive benthic surveys conducted to identify possible dietary sources of TTX, high concentrations (ave. 380 mg kg- 1) were detected in Stylochoplana sp. (Platyhelminthes) from Pilot Bay (Tauranga, New Zealand). Tetrodotoxin concentrations were found to vary temporally, peaking between June and August. The co-occurrence of Stylochoplana sp. and P. maculata in Pilot Bay raised the possibility that Stylochoplana sp. could be a dietary source of TTX for P. maculata. A real-time PCR assay was developed, and detected Stylochoplana sp. in seven out of nineteen P. maculata <b>foreguts.</b> Symbiotic bacterial production of TTX in the tissues of P. maculata and Stylochoplana sp. was also explored. Isolated strains (102; 17 unique strains - identified using 16 S rRNA gene analysis) were analyzed using a recently developed method to detect the C 9 base of TTX. In addition to enhanced sensitivity, this method has the advantage that it might detect precursor and degradation products. To explore the possibility that TTX is produced by a consortium of bacteria, experiments were undertaken where homogenized tissue was spiked into marine broth and samples were collected over two weeks for toxin and molecular analysis. No C 9 base or TTX production was detected in isolates or from bacterial communities, suggesting that a symbiotic microbial source of TTX is unlikely in these organisms. The ability of non-toxic P. maculata to sequester TTX from an environment known to contain toxic populations of the same species was also assessed. Sixteen non-toxic specimens were kept in mesh cages (eight anchored to the benthos and eight suspended 0. 5 m above it) for eight weeks and fed a non-toxic food source. Toxin analysis revealed that more ‘benthic’ specimens (4 verses the 2 from suspended specimens) sequestered TTX and were shown to retain higher concentrations (max. 0. 79 versus 0. 43 mg kg- 1). These data suggest a localized microbial source of TTX that is more readily available from the benthos. Diet analysis, utilizing next generation sequencing of toxic and non-toxic P. maculata identified their diet comprised a wide array of organisms, with Thelepus sp. and Plumularia sp. being prevalent in toxic individuals, and further testing of these organisms is suggested. Lastly, immunohistological methods, employing a monoclonal antibody targeting TTX, were conducted with tissues from P. maculata and Stylochoplana sp [...] Strong TTX signals were detected in the mantle and oocytes of P. maculata and the ova and pharynx of the Stylochoplana sp [...] These data suggest ecological roles for TTX including: defense in adults, protection in progeny, and prey capture in Stylochoplana sp [...] A synthesis of the studies presented in this thesis, and those that were conducted as part of the larger project, are also presented and future studies to elucidate the origin of TTX in New Zealand taxa are suggested...|$|R

Alternately, the <b>foregut</b> may expand into a very {{enlarged}} crop and proventriculus, or the crop could just be a diverticulum, or fluid filled structure, as in some Diptera species.|$|E
25|$|An insect {{uses its}} {{digestive}} system to extract nutrients and other substances {{from the food}} it consumes. Most of this food is ingested {{in the form of}} macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins, polysaccharides, fats, and nucleic acids. These macromolecules must be broken down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as digestion. The main structure of an insect's digestive system is a long enclosed tube called the alimentary canal, which runs lengthwise through the body. The alimentary canal directs food in one direction: from the mouth to the anus. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the <b>foregut.</b> The gut is where almost all of insects' digestion takes place. It can be divided into the <b>foregut,</b> midgut and hindgut.|$|E
