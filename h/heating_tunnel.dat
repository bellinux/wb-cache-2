40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{temperature}} field evolving in the limestone around the district <b>heating</b> <b>tunnel</b> in Copenhagen due to {{operation of the}} long-distance heating pipelines is investigated by means of poro-hydro-thermal numerical analyses. The presented parametric studies illustrate the coupling between the temperature and the groundwater flow. It is shown how a general horizontal groundwater flow and the hydraulic permeability of the surrounding ground influence the distribution and magnitude of the temperature. The {{results of the study}} can be generalised and indicate in which situations a pure conduction analysis without consideration of pore water flow is adequate and when a full conduction/convection analysis is necessary to obtain realistic results for the {{temperature field}} around heated tunnels. The significance of the temperature elevation for the structural design of the segmental tunnel lining is highlighted. ...|$|E

25|$|In January 1971, Horn was {{contacted}} by the FBI, seeking evidence involving Philip Berrigan. Berrigan, a Roman Catholic priest and anti-war activist, was serving a sentence in a nearby federal prison for burning draft files concerning the Vietnam War.

40|$|In <b>heated</b> <b>tunnels</b> such {{as those}} {{designated}} for emplacement of radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain, axial temperature gradients may cause natural convection processes that can significantly influence the moisture conditions in the tunnels and in the surrounding fractured rock. Large-scale convection cells would provide an effective mechanism for axial vapor transport, driving moisture out of the formation away from the <b>heated</b> <b>tunnel</b> section into cool end sections (where no waste is emplaced). To study such processes, we have developed and applied an enhanced version of TOUGH 2 (Pruess et al., 1999) adding a new module that solves for natural convection in open cavities. The new TOUGH 2 simulator simultaneously handles (1) the flow and energy transport processes in the fractured rock; (2) the flow and energy transport processes in the cavity; and (3) the heat and mass exchange at the rock-cavity interface. The new module is applied to simulate the future thermal-hydrological (TH) conditions within and near a representative waste emplacement tunnel at Yucca Mountain.

They were charged with 23 counts of conspiracy including plans for kidnap and blowing up <b>heating</b> <b>tunnels</b> in Washington. Although the government spent $2 million on the Harrisburg Seven trial in 1972, it did not win a conviction.

40|$|In <b>heated</b> <b>tunnels</b> such {{as those}} {{designated}} for emplacement of radioactive waste at the proposed geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, temperature gradients cause natural convection processes that may significantly influence the moisture conditions in the tunnels and in the surrounding fractured rock. Large-scale convection cells in the <b>heated</b> <b>tunnels</b> would provide an effective mechanism for turbulent mixing and axial transport of vapor generated from evaporation of pore water in the nearby formation. As a result, vapor would be transported from the elevated-temperature sections of the tunnels into cool end sections (where no waste is emplaced), would condense there, and subsequently drain into underlying rock units. To study these processes, we have developed a new simulation method that couples existing tools for simulating thermal-hydrological (TH) conditions in the fractured formation with a module that approximates turbulent natural convection in heated emplacement drifts. The new method simultaneously handles (1) the flow and energy transport processes in the fractured rock, (2) the flow and energy transport processes in the cavity, and (3) the heat and mass exchange at the rock-cavity interface. An application is presented studying the future TH conditions within and near a representative waste emplacement tunnel at Yucca Mountain.

40|$|Groundnuts {{cultivated}} in the semiarid tropics are often exposed to water stress (mid-season and end season) and high temperature (>[*] 34 [*]°C) during the critical stages of flowering and pod development. This study evaluated {{the effects of}} both water stress and high temperature under field conditions at ICRISAT, India. Treatments included two irrigations (full irrigation, 100 [*]% of crop evapotranspiration; and water stress, 40 [*]% of crop evapotranspiration), four temperature treatments {{from a combination of}} two sowing dates and <b>heat</b> <b>tunnels</b> with mean temperatures from sowing to maturity of 26. 3 ° (T 1), 27. 3 ° (T 2), 29. 0 ° (T 3) and 29. 7 °C (T 4) and two genotypes TMV 2 and ICGS 11. The <b>heat</b> <b>tunnels</b> were capable of raising the day temperature by >[*] 10 [*]°C compared to ambient. During the 20 -day high-temperature treatment at flowering, mean temperatures were 33. 8 ° (T 1), 41. 6 ° (T 2), 38. 7 ° (T 3) and 43. 5 °C (T 4). The effects of water stress and high temperature were additive and temporary for both vegetative and pod yield, and disappeared as soon as high-temperature stress was removed. Water use efficiency was significantly affected by the main effects of temperature and cultivar and not by water stress treatments. Genotypic differences for tolerance to high temperature can be attributed to differences in flowering pattern, flower number, peg-set and harvest index. It can be inferred from this study that genotypes that are tolerant to water stress are also tolerant to high temperature under field conditions. In addition, genotypes with an ability to establish greater biomass and with a significantly greater partitioning of biomass to pod yield would be suitable for sustaining higher yields in semiarid tropics with high temperature and water stress...|$|R
