40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the reliability of gross efficiency (GE) measurement (the ratio of mechanical power input to metabolic power output, expressed as a percentage) using the Douglas bag method. Methods: The experiment was conducted in two parts. Part 1 examined the potential for errors in the Douglas bag method arising from gas concentration analysis, bag residual volume, and bag leakage or gas diffusion rates. Part 2 of this study examined the within-subject day-to-day variability of GE in 10 trained male cyclists using the Douglas bag method. Participants completed three measurements of GE on separate <b>days</b> at <b>work</b> <b>rates</b> of 150, 180, 210, 240, 270, and 300 W.

40|$|Background: The {{effectiveness}} of the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model of supported employment in helping clients with severe mental illness to work in competitive jobs is well established. However, one key component of the model, ongoing support for clients who obtain employment, has not been adequately specified or empirically validated. This study examined three questions: (1) What are the two-year employment outcomes for competitively employed clients enrolled in supported employment? (2) What are the patterns of employment specialist contacts over time? (3) What {{is the relationship between}} frequency of employment specialist contact and duration of employment over two years? We hypothesized that intensity of support would be positively correlated with duration of employment. Methods: Employment specialists from four IPS programs provided monthly data on their contacts with 142 clients with severe mental illness and employment outcomes for a two-year period after each client obtained a competitive job. Using either web-based or hard copy surveys, employment specialist provided information on employment outcomes (i. e., hours <b>worked</b> per week, <b>days</b> <b>worked,</b> wage <b>rate),</b> employment changes (i. e., job starts, job losses, an...|$|R
40|$|The biomass {{of forests}} {{is one of}} the oldest and most popular sources of {{renewable}} energy. Aside from round wood, logging residue is also being used with increasing frequency to produce energy. Under European conditions, the most frequently implemented technology of using logging residue is chipping, either directly at the cutting site or at the forest roadside. However, for over a dozen years now, with more and more success, solutions have been implemented which make it possible to compress the biomass into bundles. The aim of this study was to estimate the work efficiency of a John Deere 1490 bundler working in clear cuts with various degrees of material preparation. The structure of a working <b>day,</b> <b>work</b> productivity <b>rates,</b> as well as cost and energy consumption were determined for each of three variants. The effectiveness of using a bundler, expressed by the productivity achieved, depends largely on the extent the wood slash is prepared. When the slash is concentrated in rows or piles, the machine does not have to travel over the entire work area to gather scattered material, which increases work efficiency by about 25 to 30 %. The obtained values relevantly affected costs and the amounts of energy consumed...|$|R
40|$|The {{pulmonary}} {{oxygen uptake}} (VO 2) response to incremental-ramp cycle ergometry typically demonstrates lagged-linear first-order kinetics with a slope of ~ 10 - 11 ml·min- 1 ·W- 1, both {{above and below}} the lactate threshold (ӨL), i. e. there is no discernible VO 2 slow component (or "excess" VO 2) above ӨL. We were interested in determining whether a reverse ramp profile would yield the same response dynamics. Ten healthy males performed a maximum incremental -ramp (15 - 30 W·min- 1, depending on fitness). On another <b>day,</b> the <b>work</b> <b>rate</b> (WR) was increased abruptly to the incremental maximum and then decremented at the same rate of 15 - 30 W. min- 1 (step-decremental ramp). Five subjects also performed a sub-maximal ramp-decremental test from 90 % of ӨL. VO 2 was determined breath-by-breath from continuous monitoring of respired volumes (turbine) and gas concentrations (mass spectrometer). The incremental-ramp VO 2 -WR slope was 10. 3 ± 0. 7 ml·min- 1 ·W- 1, whereas that of the descending limb of the decremental ramp was 14. 2 ± 1. 1 ml·min- 1 ·W- 1 (p < 0. 005). The sub-maximal decremental-ramp slope, however, was only 9. 8 ± 0. 9 ml·min- 1 ·W- 1 : not significantly {{different from that of the}} incremental-ramp. This suggests that the VO 2 response in the supra-ӨL domain of incremental-ramp exercise manifest not actual, but pseudo, first-order kinetic...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Clinical asthma {{guidelines}} recommend spirometry for asthma diagnosis, {{but there}} is inconsistent evidence about benefits to patients in using it for ongoing management. Our aim {{was to determine whether}} training in the use of spirometry for management of asthma provided better health outcomes and improved the quality of care in the primary care setting. Design: Pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial. Setting: General practices in two states of Australia. Participants: Forty practices and 397 adults with asthma. Intervention: The staff of 26 intervention practices received comprehensive spirometry training. Fourteen control practices provided usual care. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measures were quality of life, self-reported asthma symptoms and lung function. Secondary measures related to the process of care (e. g. performance of spirometry, preparation of a written asthma action plan) and patient and general practitioner rating of the acceptability and usefulness of spirometry. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the groups at 12 months for quality of life (mean difference = − 0. 23; 95 % CI: − 0. 44, − 0. 01), <b>days</b> off <b>work</b> (<b>rate</b> ratio = 1. 52; 95 % CI: 0. 91, 2. 54), exacerbations (rate ratio = 1. 09; 95 % CI: 0. 85, 1. 41), asthma on waking (rate ratio = 1. 21; 95 % CI: 0. 79, 1. 85), nocturnal asthma (rate ratio = 0. 98; 95 % CI: 0. 63, 1. 51) and post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio (mean difference = − 0. 01, 95 % CI: − 0. 03, 0. 02). There was no improvement in the quality of care provided. Conclusions: Training in spirometry did not result in any measurable improvement in the use of spirometry, quality of management of asthma or patient outcomes in primary care.

40|$|PURPOSE: (i) To {{evaluate}} firefighters 2 ̆ 7 pre- and post-shift hydration status {{across two}} shifts of wildfire suppression work {{in hot weather}} conditions. (ii) To document firefighters 2 ̆ 7 fluid intake during and between two shifts of wildfire suppression work. (iii) To compare firefighters 2 ̆ 7 heart rate, activity, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and core temperature across the two consecutive shifts of wildfire suppression work. METHOD: Across two consecutive days, 12 salaried firefighters 2 ̆ 7 hydration status was measured immediately pre- and post-shift. Hydration status was also measured 2 h post-shift. RPE was also measured immediately post-shift on each <b>day.</b> <b>Work</b> activity, heart <b>rate,</b> and core temperature were logged continuously during each shift. Ten firefighters also manually recorded their food and fluid intake before, during, and after both fireground shifts. RESULTS: Firefighters were not euhydrated at all measurement points on Day one (292 ± 1 mOsm l(- 1)) and euhydrated across these same time points on Day two (289 ± 0. 5 mOsm l(- 1)). Fluid consumption following firefighters 2 ̆ 7 shift on Day one (1792 ± 1134 ml) trended (P = 0. 08) higher than Day two (1108 ± 1142 ml).

This study investigated the correlation between reported injury and illness occurrence, absolute aerobic capacity, and lifestyle/non-occupational risk factors in a sample of 212 young male manual material handlers. The subjects were selected from three locations in the United States (Southeast, Midwest, and West). Estimated maximal aerobic capacity was obtained for all subjects using a submaximal bench-step protocol. Lifestyle and nonoccupational information (smoking and exercise regimens) was acquired from the health history survey form. This investigation consisted of evaluating V 02 max with lifestyle regimens and their interaction, lifestyle regimens and injury/illness information, and with facility location. Analysis results indicate no significance between smoking or smoking/exercise interaction with absolute V 02 max. Exercise did demonstrate significance with V 02 max. Smoking demonstrated significance with injuries and with lost <b>work</b> <b>day</b> <b>rate.</b> Smoking also demonstrated significance among one of the locations sampled.

40|$|Treadmill {{training}} and testing applications combine changes in speed and angle {{to achieve a}} target <b>work</b> <b>rate</b> profile.

Current methods of computing speed and angle are first reformulated in terms of <b>work</b> <b>rate,</b> rather than time, so that the existing limitation to <b>work</b> <b>rate</b> ramps is removed: the new methods allow arbitrary changes in <b>work</b> <b>rate</b> over time. New solutions are derived which allow the speed and angle functions to be positioned arbitrarily within the available speed and angle envelopes. It is shown that the methods can be easily specialised to the particular case of an incremental exercise test where <b>work</b> <b>rate</b> is defined to increase linearly with respect to time.

40|$|Measures of psychophysiological {{recovery}} {{were used}} to evaluate two rest break schedules; 7. 5 minutes of rest after every 50 minutes of work versus 15 minutes of rest after every 100 minutes of work. Eleven examiners using a prototype computer system in the European Patent Office worked under both workhest schedules. Electrodermal activity, heart rate, respiratory frequency, pulse wave transit time, neck electromyogram, and gross body movements were continuously recorded. Measures of emotional well-being and body comfort were obtained eight times per <b>work</b> <b>day.</b> Heart <b>rate</b> variability was significantly higher under the short break schedule, indicating decreased mental strain. Break duration and time of measurement interacted significantly for electrodermal responses, indicating that emotional strain was reduced under the short break schedule until mid-day, and under the long break schedule in the afternoon. The results indicate that a switch to longer breaks in the afternoon may be favorable during highly demanding computer work. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that psychophysiological measures are useful {{for the evaluation of}} worldrest schedules, even if performance data are not available...|$|R
