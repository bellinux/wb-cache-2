There are the art classes at the Slade, and the lectures I am down for, and the Senior Cambridge and cookery and nursing.

2500|$|Tamogami {{is known}} for making jokes, {{particularly}} about his own diminutive stature. When criticized for his outspoken remarks he countered that [...] "he did not lack loftiness (...) of speech, only of height (...) [...] ", and when commenting on defense spending cuts, {{he said of his}} own appointment, [...] "The slimming down of the self defense forces has begun, with the appointment of a more compact Chief of Staff." [...] When criticized for accepting severance pay after the scandal caused by his essay, he quipped, [...] "Well, at last my wife and children are giving me hot food again." [...] During the 2014 gubernatorial campaign, he said [...] "although <b>I</b> <b>make</b> this <b>face,</b> <b>I</b> am actually a good person." ...|$|R
60|$|Even {{the most}} {{valuable}} and expensive pet may become a vexation if it is continually showing ill-temper and fractiousness. Mrs Monnerie merely puckered her lips or shrugged her shoulders at my outbursts of vanity and insolence. But drops of water will wear away a stone. From being Court Favourite I gradually sank to being Court Fool. In sheer ennui and desperation I waggled my bells and brandished my bladder. A cat may look at a Queen, but it should, <b>I</b> am sure, <b>make</b> <b>faces</b> only at her Ladies-in-waiting.|$|R

Now I write you from my mosquito curtain, to the song of saws and planes and hammers, and wood clumping on the floor above; in a day of heavenly brightness; a bird twittering near by; my eye, through the open door, commanding green meads, two or three forest trees casting their boughs against the sky, a forest-clad mountain-side beyond, and close in by the door-jamb a nick of the blue Pacific. It is March in England, bleak March, and I lie here with the great sliding doors wide open in an undershirt and p'jama trousers, and melt in the closure of mosquito bars, and burn {{to be out in}} the breeze. A few torn clouds--not white, the sun has tinged them a warm pink--swim in heaven. In which blessed and fair day, <b>I</b> have to <b>make</b> <b>faces</b> and speak bitter words to a man--who has deceived me, it is true--but who is poor, and older than I, and a kind of a gentleman too. On the whole, I prefer the massacre of weeds.|$|R

6000|$|In {{the darkened}} Strand, {{hundreds}} of khaki-clad figures and girls were streaming by, {{and all their}} voices had a hard, half-jovial vulgarity. The motor-cabs and buses pushed along remorselessly; newspaper-sellers muttered their ceaseless invitations. Again the painter made his gesture of despair: [...] "How am I to get into my picture this modern life, which washes round him as round that church, there, {{standing in the middle}} of the street? See how the currents sweep round it, as if to wash it away; yet it stands, seeming not to see them. If I were a phantasist, it would be easy enough: but to be a phantasist is too simple for me--those romantic gentlemen bring what they like from anywhere, to serve their ends. Moi, je suis realiste. And so, monsieur, I have invented an idea. I am painting over his head while he sits there at the piano a picture hanging on the wall--of one of these young town girls who have no mysteriousness at all, no youth; nothing but a cheap knowledge and defiance, and good humour. He is looking up at it, but he does not see it. <b>I</b> will <b>make</b> the <b>face</b> of that girl the face of modern life, and he shall sit staring at it, seeing nothing. What do you think of my idea?" ...|$|R

40|$|How can <b>I</b> <b>make</b> {{art that}} <b>face</b> {{people in their}} {{everyday}} lives, which is integrated into their lives, becoming {{a part of the}} discussions both in the mundane and in the room of society? Can I do this by working with performative interpretations that are participatory driven? I have explored how artists and participants can create spaces that are both open and confiden- ce-building, and how they at the same time enable us to question established norms. How to engage in dialogues concerning social, political and existential issues like; What is freedom for me - What is freedom to you? What is it that is important? Which topics are never upraised for discussion? The project is about putting thoughts, experiences and bodies (my own, the participants and the viewer’s) in relation {{to each other and to}} the location and context they are in. It ́s about creating a broader perspective where everyone’s voice is important and can take place. It’s about how we in a collective process can collaborate and create artistically through performa- tive expressions in an artwork in which they are participants/actors and I ́m the artistic director. I have also examined whether participatory driven projects is a good condition for creating interpretations that have a critical potential and not just becoming a ”feel-good- experience” for the involved, an instrument to solve social problems or becoming a tool for learning. In the work I’ll try if performative interpretations that are participatory driven are the way to drill into the real world - into the body of humans and the system that we operate under, and how to do so without compromise the artistic intention, ethics and aesthetics...|$|R
