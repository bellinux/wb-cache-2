However, midline diastema is commonly cited as a malocclusion with high relapse incidence by orthodontists. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the stability of maxillary interincisor diastemas closure and the association of their relapse and interincisor width, overjet, overbite and root parallelism. Material and Methods: Sample comprised 30 patients with at least a pretreatment midline diastema of 0. 5 mm or greater after eruption of the maxillary permanent canines. Dental casts and panoramic radiographs were taken at pretreatment, posttreatment and postretention. Results: Before treatment, midline diastema width was 1. 52 mm (SD= 0. 88) and right and left lateral diastema widths were 0. 55 mm (SD= 0. 56) and 0. 57 mm (SD= 0. 53), respectively. According to repeated measures analysis of variance, only midline diastema demonstrated significant relapse. In the overall sample the average relapse of midline diastema was 0. 49 mm (SD= 0. 66), whilst the unstable patients showed a mean space reopening of 0. 78 mm (SD= 0. 66). Diastema closure in the area between central and lateral incisors showed great stability. Multivariate correlation tests showed that only initial diastema width (&# 946;= 0. 60) and relapse of overjet (&# 946;= 0. 39) presented association with relapse of midline diastema. Conclusions: Midline diastema relapse was statistically significant and occurred in 60 % of the sample, while lateral diastemas closure remained stable after treatment. Only initial diastema width and overjet relapse showed association with relapse of midline diastema. There was no association between relapse of interincisor diastema and root parallelism...|$|E
