While South Indian states have improved in some of the socio-economic metrics, poverty continues to affect the region as it does the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years. Basis the 2011 census, HDI in the southern states is high and the economy has <b>grown</b> <b>at</b> a faster rate than most northern states.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the primary}} {{agricultural}} product from Rancho Camulos was wine. Ninety acres (360,000 m²) of vineyards were planted in the 1860s and Camulos wines and brandies were known throughout Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. In 1870, records indicate Camulos was largest of the four vintners in the San Buenaventura Township of Santa Barbara County, with 45 tons (40,900kg) of grapes grown, making 6,000 US gallons (23,000 L) of wine and 800 US gallons (3,000 L) of brandy. In addition to oranges and grapes, the ranch produced almonds, walnuts, apricots, wheat, corn and barley. Flower petals from roses <b>grown</b> <b>at</b> Camulos were shipped to Europe to make perfume.|$|E
5|$|Old Village Farm (on Fishermans Lane) {{is now the}} {{location}} of a wood yard, used since the 1930s to prepare local willow for the production of cricket bats. The trees are <b>grown</b> <b>at</b> Harbour Hill Copse, where 70 trees are felled annually for this purpose. There are approximately 1000 trees growing at any given time. The workers at the yard cut the wood into approximate bat shapes, then cure the wood in a kiln. The clefts of wood are then shipped to India where the final manufacturing can be undertaken under moisture-controlled conditions.|$|E

5|$|South Dakota is {{relatively}} notable for {{its lack of}} large urban centers. Sioux Falls, the largest city in the state, only ranks as the 152nd largest in the country, and the state's third-largest city, Aberdeen, {{has a population of}} less than 25,000. However, because the population in many rural areas has decreased over the last 50 years, and many cities in the state have <b>grown</b> <b>at</b> a rapid pace; the population has become more concentrated and less rural than it once was. According to 2007 census estimates, the three most populous counties in the state, Minnehaha, Pennington, and Lincoln, were home to 38.8% of South Dakotans, while in 1910, those counties held only 9.3% of the population.|$|E
5|$|The type genus, Lily (Lilium), has a {{long history}} in {{literature}} and art, and a tradition of symbolism as well as becoming a popular female name, and a floral emblem, particularly of France (fleur-de-lis). The cultivation of lilies has been described since at least the ninth century, when Charlemagne ordered it to be <b>grown</b> <b>at</b> his imperial palaces. However, the name 'lily' has historically been applied {{to a wide variety of}} plants other than the Lilium genus.|$|E
5|$|There {{are often}} {{substantial}} {{differences between the}} remiges and rectrices of adults and juveniles of the same species. Because all juvenile feathers are <b>grown</b> <b>at</b> once—a tremendous energy burden to the developing bird—they are softer and of poorer quality than the equivalent feathers of adults, which are moulted {{over a longer period}} of time (as long as several years in some cases). As a result, they wear more quickly.|$|E

5|$|Years after independence, West Bengal {{was still}} {{dependent}} on the central government for help in meeting its demands for food; food production remained stagnant, and the Indian green revolution bypassed the state. However, {{there has been a}} significant increase in food production since the 1980s, and the state now has a surplus of grains. The state's share of total industrial output in India was 9.8% in 1980–1981, declining to 5% by 1997–1998. In contrast, the service sector has <b>grown</b> <b>at</b> a rate higher than the national rate.|$|E
5|$|A common mushroom, Mycena nargan {{is found}} growing singly or in {{clusters}} {{on the underside}} of rotting wood in wet and shaded areas, and is especially partial to Eucalyptus and Pinus pinaster. Fruit bodies usually appear from April to June. The species has been recorded from Tasmania, Victoria and southeastern South Australia. The Australian Fungimap initiative has reported isolated collections in Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales, although the majority of sightings have been in Tasmania and Victoria. The fungus is saprobic, meaning it derives nutrients from dead or dying organic matter. A field study conducted in Tasmania showed that it is {{much more likely to be}} found in mature eucalypt forest (defined as having <b>grown</b> <b>at</b> least 70 years before the last wildfire) than young, regenerating forest that had experienced clearfelling, burning, and sowing two to three years previously.|$|E
5|$|Maraba {{coffee is}} {{grown in the}} south of Rwanda at {{coordinates}} , roughly 12kilometres (7mi) from Butare and 150kilometres (93mi) from the capital, Kigali. The project began in the Maraba District of Butare Province, but these entities were replaced under local government organisation in 2006, and the area is now part of Huye District in the Southern Province. The area is very hilly, due to its proximity to the Western Rift Valley and the montane Nyungwe Forest, and features rich volcanic soils. The coffee is <b>grown</b> <b>at</b> altitudes between 1,700 and 2,100 metres (5,577–6,889ft) above sea level, often on steep hillsides with terrace farming. The area experiences an average of 115centimetres (45in) of rainfall annually. The majority of this falls during the rainy season of March to May, the major coffee harvesting season. The high altitude lowers the temperature slightly to an average of about 20 °C (68 °F). There is little seasonal variation.|$|E
