5|$|Carl Linnaeus {{described}} the grey <b>jay</b> as Corvus canadensis in the 12th {{edition of his}} Systema Naturae in 1766. William John Swainson named it Dysornithia brachyrhncha in 1831. French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte assigned the grey <b>jay</b> to the genus Perisoreus in 1838 in A geographical and comparative list of the birds of Europe and North America, along with the Siberian <b>jay,</b> P. infaustus. The grey <b>jay</b> belongs to the crow and <b>jay</b> family Corvidae. However, it {{and the other members}} of its genus are not closely related to other birds known as jays; they are instead close to the genus Cyanopica, which contains the azure-winged magpie. Its relatives are native to Eurasia, and ancestors of the grey <b>jay</b> are thought to have diverged from their Old World relatives and crossed Beringia into North America.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 2001 {{and into}} 2002, CZW's {{territory}} (that is, the area at which they held {{the majority of their}} events) was shifting from Sewell, New Jersey to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in order to hold events regularly at the old ECW arena, beginning with December 15's Cage of Death 3. At this event, they faced Nick Gage and Nate Hatred, but wore masks and were identified as The Midnight Outlaws. This was likely to get around the fact that <b>Jay</b> was only 17 and Mark only 16 at the time; this meant, as they were under 18 years of age, that they could not legally work in a sport wrestling exhibition in the state of Pennsylvania. As CZW regularly began holding shows in the Philadelphia area, the Midnight Outlaws made appearances at the next four CZW events. At A Higher Level of Pain on April 13, 2002, <b>Jay</b> appeared across the ring from the Midnight Outlaws, tagging with Ruckus against Mark and someone else. By this time, he had turned 18. <b>Jay</b> and Ruckus were won the match, and this was the last time either <b>Jay</b> or Mark appeared for CZW until April 12, 2003, where <b>Jay</b> and Mark both returned for Best of the Best 3. <b>Jay</b> was a surprise entrant after being taunted by A.J.

5|$|Caching is {{inhibited}} by {{the presence}} of Steller's <b>jays</b> (Cyanocitta stelleri) and grey <b>jays</b> from adjacent territories, which follow resident grey <b>jays</b> to steal cached food. Grey <b>jays</b> carry large food items to distant cache sites for storage more often than small food items. To prevent theft, they also tend to carry valuable food items further from the source when caching in the company of one or more grey <b>jays.</b> Scatterhoarding discourages pilferage by competitors, while increased cache density leads to increased thievery. In southern portions of the grey <b>jay's</b> range, food is not cached during summer because of the chance of spoilage and the reduced need for winter stores.|$|R
