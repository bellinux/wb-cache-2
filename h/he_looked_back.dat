5|$|Judy {{also pointed}} out the {{approach}} of hostile Japanese aircraft long before any of the human crew could hear them. This first occurred prior to the outbreak of war, when the aircraft would fly low over the Gnat with Judy barking at them until they had passed. On an outing to Jiujiang, Jefferey took Judy for a walk outside of the city but she ran ahead, pulling him with her. He realised as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> {{that she had been}} pulling him away from a Leopard. In November 1937, the Gnat met with the American river gunboat USS Panay. After the Panay held a party for the two ship's companies, the Gnat crew departed and only realised afterwards that Judy was not with them. They contacted the Panay via signal lamp, but they insisted that they had not seen her. The following morning, the crew heard from a Chinese trader that Judy was on board the Panay after all. In retaliation, a party boarded the American vessel and stole the ship's bell. Afterwards they contacted the Panay and offered them the bell back in return for Judy. She was returned within the hour.|$|E

On 21 May 2007, he {{presented a}}n hour-long documentary, Battle for the Holy Land: Love Thy Neighbour, about the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. He visited Bethlehem, Hebron and the Israeli settlement of Tekoa. Liddle sought to examine whether Israel was a true liberal democracy in light of its treatment of the Palestinians. He also appeared in Channel 4's alternative election night episode of Come Dine With Me along with Edwina Currie, Derek Hatton and Brian Paddick.|$|E

500|$|Although {{they came}} to {{learn a great deal}} about the game, neither Kotok nor McCarthy were known as chess players. Mikhail Botvinnik, three times world chess champion, wrote in his book Computers, Chess and Long-Range Planning that the Kotok–McCarthy program's [...] "rule for rejecting moves was so {{constituted}} that the machine threw the baby out with the bath water." [...] The program drew criticism from Richard Greenblatt, who later wrote Mac Hack, which beat a person in tournament play, and more recently, from Hans Berliner, when <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> on it in 2005. During the Cold War, Kotok-McCarthy played (and lost to) the best Russian chess program in the first match between computer programs.|$|E

Now he was charged with emotion.” When the convoy reached a train crossing, Nghĩa said that Nhung “lunged at Nhu with a bayonet and stabbed him again and again, maybe fifteen or twenty times. Still in a rage, he turned to Diệm, took out his revolver and shot him in the head. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> at Nhu, who was lying on the floor, twitching.

500|$|Barbree's {{most recent}} book, [...] "Live from Cape Canaveral: Covering the Space Race, from Sputnik to Today", was {{released}} on August 28, 2007, {{to coincide with the}} 50th anniversary of spaceflight, that began with the Sputnik 1 launch on October 4, 1957. The foreword is written by Tom Brokaw. Barbree's book attempts to illustrate how the media has changed in their coverage of the space programs, from the early enthusiasm to the relative disinterest in the program today. Barbree says he wrote the book because as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> over his career, when recalling all the people he'd worked with, very few were left. Barbree claims that he told himself, [...] "You're {{the only one who has}} covered the whole program going all the way back to the beginning, and if you don't tell the story, who is going to do it?" [...] It received generally poor reviews from space historians.|$|E
500|$|Why Sibelius {{should have}} failed to prepare The Wood Nymph for {{publication}} {{is a question that}} has perplexed scholars. On the advice of Ferruccio Busoni, Sibelius in 1895 offered The Wood Nymph to the Russian music publisher Mitrofan Belyayev but it was not published. Murtomäki has suggested that Sibelius, despite having been fond of The Wood Nymph, was [...] "unsure about the true value" [...] of his output from the 1890s, an ambivalence that is perhaps best illustrated by the piecemeal publication history of, and multiple revisions to, the four Lemminkäinen legends (appearing in the composer's 1911 diary under a list of works to be rewritten, The Wood Nymph, too, seems to have been scheduled by Sibelius for a reexamination, albeit one that never came to pass). Scholars have offered a number of explanations as to why Sibelius may have [...] "turned his back" [...] on his early compositions. Perhaps, as master, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> on the works of his youth as technically [...] "inferior" [...] to his mature output; or, as evolving artist, he sought distance from passionate, nationalistic exclamations as he developed his own, unique musical style and aimed to transition from [...] "local hero" [...] to [...] "international composer"; or, as elder statesman, he feared he might have [...] "revealed himself too much" [...] in early [...] "confessional" [...] works, such as En saga, Lemminkäinen and the Maidens of the Island, and The Wood Nymph. In the absence of any new information from Sibelius's papers, however, the reason why The Wood Nymph was never published ultimately [...] "appears doomed to remain a subject of speculation".|$|E

Truscott maintains that {{when he arrived at the}} bridge, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> toward the intersection where he had dropped Harper off and observed that a vehicle had stopped and that she was in the process of entering it. On June 10, 1959 at 9:30a.m. Steven was interviewed by (Constable) Hobbs in a cruiser at his school. He told Hobbs that while standing on the bridge, he saw Lynne get into a [...] "late model Chevrolet" [...] and there [...] "was a lot of chrome on the car and it could have been a Bellair [...] version."

During his time there, he rented a room from George Stillman Hillard, business partner of Charles Sumner. Hawthorne wrote in the comparative obscurity of what he called his [...] "owl's nest" [...] in the family home. As <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> on this period of his life, he wrote: [...] "I have not lived, but only dreamed about living." [...] He contributed short stories to various magazines and annuals, including [...] "Young Goodman Brown" [...] and [...] "The Minister's Black Veil", though none drew major attention to him.

[...] "I have spent my adult life trying to conceal my Leave it to Beaver past or correcting the historical record. Either way the series has become inescapable. When I was a kid, I loved acting; in fact, I badgered my father and mother until they allowed me to work.

I felt a flash of panic as I lost sight of the Hun, but Leycester must have been able to see him all right as he kept on firing. My sudden turn had done the trick. The Albatros overshot and suddenly appeared right in front of me. Because of the relative motion of our two aircraft, he seemed to hang motionless, suspended in mid-air. I could see the pilot's face as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> at me. I sent a two-second burst of Vickers (machine gun) fire into him. His aircraft seemed to flutter, then slid out of sight below my starboard wing. I was pretty certain that I had hit his petrol tank. Behind me, Leycester was still blazing away. He was using tracer (incendiary bullets), and it may have been one of his bullets that ignited the petrol pouring from the Hun's ruptured tank. When I caught sight of the Albatros again, it was burning like a torch and side-slipping towards the ground, trailing a streamer of smoke.
