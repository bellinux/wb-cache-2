2500|$|Since the 2006 (79th) Academy Awards, {{submitted}} films {{no longer}} have to be in an official language of the submitting country. This requirement had previously prevented countries from submitting films where the majority of the dialogue was spoken in a language that was non-native to the submitting country, and the Academy's executive director explicitly cited as a reason for the rule change the case of the Italian film Private (2004), which was disqualified simply because its main spoken languages were Arabic and Hebrew, neither of which are indigenous languages of Italy. This rule change enabled a country like Canada to receive a nomination for a Hindi-language <b>film,</b> <b>Water.</b> Previously, Canada had been nominated for French-language films only, since films shot in Canada's other official language (English) were ineligible for consideration for the Foreign Language Film category. Before the rule change, Canada had submitted two films in different languages—the invented-language film A Bullet in the Head in 1991 and the Inuktitut language film [...] in 2001. Inuktitut, one of the country's aboriginal languages, is not official throughout Canada, but was (and still is) official in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories. Neither film earned a nomination. The rule change, however, did not affect the eligibility of non-English speaking American films, which are still disqualified from the Foreign Language Film category due to their nationality. Because of this, a Japanese-language film like Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) or a Mayan-language film like Apocalypto (2006) were unable to compete for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, even though they were both nominated for (and, in the case of Letters from Iwo Jima, won) the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, which does not have similar nationality restrictions. The nationality restrictions also differ from the practice of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) for their analogous award for Best Film Not in the English Language. While BAFTA Award eligibility requires a commercial release in the United Kingdom, that body does not impose a nationality restriction.|$|E

The 3 D {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model and fluid structure interaction (FSI) model of water-lubricated rubber bearing with 10 axial grooves was built by ADINA and the influences of axial velocity, rotating speed on deformation of bearing bush and distribution of <b>water</b> <b>film</b> pressure are researched in this article. The results show that elastic deformation of bearing bush reduces <b>water</b> <b>film</b> pressure relative to rigid assumption; with the increasing of axial velocity, the deformation of bearing bush and <b>water</b> <b>film</b> pressure increases; and the axial velocity has a obvious influence {{on the front of}} bearing bush and <b>water</b> <b>film</b> pressure; with the increasing of bearing rotating speed, the deformation of bearing bush and <b>water</b> <b>film</b> pressure raises, but the deformation of bearing bush and <b>water</b> <b>film</b> pressure in <b>water</b> grooves are almost close to zero...|$|R

40|$|The {{interfaces}} between solids and <b>water</b> <b>films</b> in air play fundamental {{roles in}} physicochemical phenomena, biological functions, and nano-fabrication. Though {{the properties of the}} interfaces have been considered to be irrelevant to the <b>water</b> <b>film</b> thickness, we found distinctive mechanical features of the interface between a cleaved muscovite mica surface and a thin <b>water</b> <b>film</b> grown in humid air, dissimilar to those in bulk water, using frequency-modulation atomic force microscopy. The thin <b>water</b> <b>film</b> grew with quasi-stabilized hydration networks of water molecules, tightly bound each other at the interface, to a thickness of ~ 2 [*]nm at near-saturating humidity. Consequently, defective structures of the hydration networks persisted vertically through the hydration layers at the interface, and K^+ ions on the cleaved surface remained without dissolution into the <b>water</b> <b>film.</b> The results provide atomistic insights into thin <b>water</b> <b>films</b> in regard to epitaxial-like growth from vapour and the motion of water molecules and ions therein...|$|R

40|$|Heating {{and thermal}} {{insulation}} {{characteristics of a}} falling hot <b>water</b> <b>film</b> on the roof or the screen sheet of a greenhouse may be analysed by evaluating the temperature profile of the thin <b>water</b> <b>film.</b> The temperature profile of the falling <b>water</b> <b>film</b> {{can be obtained by}} solving the conduction equation with several suitable boundary conditions, based on the concept of “Transfer and Rate of Processes”. The generalized analytical solution of the temperature profile of the <b>water</b> <b>film</b> was given by Eq. (15) and the average temperature at an arbitrary distance along the direction of water flow, ζ=ζ was given by Eq. (18). From the calculated results of illustrative examples by the analytical solutions, the temperature of the <b>water</b> <b>film</b> at the <b>water</b> film-roof interface, ξ= 1 could be approximated by the average temperature of the <b>water</b> <b>film,</b> an effective distance for heating the air in the greenhouse, ζR was determined from the relation between Φav(ζ) and the dimensionless temperature of the greenhouse ΦR and the most suitable thickness of the <b>water</b> <b>film</b> δ could be estimated by plotting Φav (1) against δ with a parameter ΦR, as shown in Fig. 6. The relationship between Φav(1) and δ in Fig. 6 will be also applicable to estimate the suitable flow rate of water. According to the calculated results, the <b>water</b> <b>film</b> performs broadly the task of thermal insulation at the water-roof interface. The corresponding amount of heat to the thermal insulation effect of the <b>water</b> <b>film</b> was given by Eq. (21), theoretically. Figs. 10, 11 and 12 show the over-all heat balance of the <b>water</b> <b>film</b> obtained by Eq. (21) and the amount of heat calculated from Eq. (21) is evaluated quantitatively by the rate of reduction of heating load for heating the greenhouse. Therefore, the analytical solutions and procedures described here are useful for the calculation of actual heat requirement for heating a greenhouse, the design and operations of the practical water curtain system...|$|R
