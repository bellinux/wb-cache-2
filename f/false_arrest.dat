25|$|On January 28, 2007 a {{woman named}} Roberta Shalaby was found badly beaten on the {{sidewalk}} outside the Hells Angels' clubhouse at 77 East Third Street in the East Village, Manhattan. The resulting investigation by the NYPD has been criticized by the group for its intensity. The police were refused access to the Hells Angels clubhouse and responded by closing off the area, setting up sniper positions, and sending in an armored personnel carrier. After obtaining a warrant, the police searched the clubhouse and arrested one Hells Angel who was later released. The group claims to have no connection with the beating of Shalaby. Five security cameras cover {{the entrance to the}} New York chapter's East 3rd Street club house, but the NY HAMC maintains nobody knows how Shalaby was beaten nearly to death at their front door. A club lawyer said they intended to sue the city of New York for <b>false</b> <b>arrest</b> and possible civil rights violations.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the Newsday report came out, the Public Safety Committee had not put police {{misconduct}} on the agenda for years. As a result, impunity for misconduct in Nassau County policing is endemic. Instances range from <b>false</b> <b>arrests,</b> through filing falsified reports, planting evidence to excessive force. Some officers have multiple compensation awards made against them at the taxpayers' expense and yet remain on the payroll.|$|R

5000|$|Harassment via {{the legal}} system: The FBI and police abused {{the legal system}} to harass dissidents and make them appear to be criminals. Officers of the law gave perjured {{testimony}} and presented fabricated evidence as a pretext for <b>false</b> <b>arrests</b> and wrongful imprisonment. They discriminatorily enforced tax laws and other government regulations and used conspicuous surveillance, [...] "investigative" [...] interviews, and grand jury subpoenas {{in an effort to}} intimidate activists and silence their supporters.|$|R
25|$|In 1985, Dr. Humberto Alvarez-Machain, a Mexican national, {{allegedly}} {{assisted in}} the torture and murder of a U.S. DEA agent in Mexico. Notwithstanding that the U.S had an extradition treaty with Mexico (and because the Mexican government declined to extradite a Mexican national to the U.S. for a crime allegedly committed in Mexico), the U.S. Government hired a private citizen and some Mexican nationals to essentially act as mercenaries, who then went into Mexico, kidnapped Dr. Alvarez-Machain, and {{brought him back to}} the U.S. for trial for the crime committed in Mexico. The trial court ruled that since Alvarez-Machain had been brought to the U.S. in violation of the treaty, his arrest was unlawful. The United States Supreme Court, in United States v. Alvarez-Machain, ruled that notwithstanding the existence of an extradition treaty with Mexico, it was still legal for the U.S. government to exercise self-help and essentially grab him off the street in Mexico ("forcible abduction") to bring him back to the U.S. for trial. In Alvarez-Machain's subsequent criminal trial, he was acquitted, and he lost a civil suit he filed for <b>false</b> <b>arrest</b> against the government.|$|E
500|$|A {{couple of}} weeks after her trial, Clark pressed charges of <b>false</b> <b>arrest</b> against the officer who had arrested her. The next day, the officer {{physically}} attacked Clark {{in the presence of}} witnesses for having brought charges against him. [...] Crane, who initially went briefly to Philadelphia to escape the pressure of publicity, returned to New York to give testimony at Becker's trial despite advice given to him from Theodore Roosevelt, who was Police Commissioner at the time and a new acquaintance of Crane. [...] The defense targeted Crane: police raided his apartment and interviewed people who knew him, trying to find incriminating evidence in order to lessen the effect of his testimony. A vigorous cross-examination took place that sought to portray Crane as a man of dubious morals; while the prosecution proved that he frequented brothels, Crane claimed this was merely for research purposes. After the trial ended on October 16, the arresting officer was exonerated, and Crane's reputation was ruined.|$|E

In many cases, Phung Hoang chiefs were incompetent bureaucrats who used their {{positions}} to enrich themselves. Phoenix tried to address this problem by establishing monthly neutralization quotas, but these often led to fabrications or, worse, <b>false</b> <b>arrests.</b> In some cases, district officials accepted bribes from the NLF to release certain suspects.|$|R

District of Columbia, a federal lawsuit for <b>false</b> <b>arrest</b> brought by hundreds of protesters who were arrested at demonstrations against the IMF and World Bank in April 2000, but the groups split over differences in legal tactics and approaches. The case settled in June 2010 for $13.7 million.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tribunal}} {{found that}} several events {{had occurred in}} Johns life to make him perceive that things were getting progressively worse for him.

[...] On May 21, a grand jury indicted the officers on most of the original charges filed by Mosby {{with the exception of the}} charges of illegal imprisonment and <b>false</b> <b>arrest,</b> and added charges of reckless endangerment to all the officers involved.|$|E
5000|$|Operation Ore was a British police {{operation}} that commenced in 1999 following information received from US law enforcement, which {{was intended to}} prosecute thousands of users of a website reportedly featuring child pornography.

Operation Ore identified and prosecuted some sex offenders, but {{the validity of the}} police procedures was later questioned, as errors in the investigations resulted in a large number of <b>false</b> <b>arrests.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Allen v.

The plaintiffs’ claims involved a litany of constitutional violations, including, <b>false</b> <b>arrests,</b> unreasonable seizures, <b>false</b> imprisonments, the planting of evidence, excessive use of force, falsification of police reports, racially biased policing and kidnapping. Ultimately, the 119 individual plaintiffs who joined the lawsuit collectively settled their damage claims with the City of Oakland for $10.5 million.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, the U.S. Department of Justice {{alleged that}} the city and police force had {{subjected}} numerous individuals to [...] "excessive force, <b>false</b> <b>arrests,</b> charges, and reports" [...] and had engaged in practices regarding [...] "improper stops, searches, and seizures". The report from the Department also stated that excessive force was levied against individuals who witnessed incidents of police misconduct, and against those who were known critics {{of the city and}} its police force. Those individuals were also falsely detained if the city and the police agreed that they were [...] "likely to complain of abuse". It further stated that the officers involved falsified reports and tampered with official police recorders so that [...] "misconduct would not be recorded".|$|R

Yagman, who characterized the incident as an example of police brutality, claimed Tabatabainejad was the only person who was asked to show ID. A November 22, 2006 article in the Los Angeles Times reported that Yagman had said on November 21 that he was no longer representing Tabatabainejad.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{decision}} to start treating Downes disappearance as a murder, {{there were a number}} of arrests in the case. In 2007 two men were put on trial. [...] The prosecution alleged at Preston Crown Court that Charlene Downes, 14, was killed by Iyad Albattikhi, a 29-year-old man from Jordan, the owner of [...] "Funny Boyz" [...] fast-food outlet in Blackpool. [...] Mohammed Reveshi, Albattikhi's business partner, was accused of disposing of her body. According to the prosecution, the defendants had sex with Downes. [...] The prosecution alleged the men spoke of disposing of her body by putting it in kebabs sold from a fast food outlet. The jury failed to reach a verdict, and at a re-trial the prosecution withdrew the charges. Both defendants were freed and given compensation for <b>false</b> <b>arrest</b> of around £250,000.|$|E
2500|$|In A.M., {{on behalf}} of her minor child, F.M. v. Ann Holmes (2016), the Tenth Circuit {{considered}} {{a case in which}} a 13-year-old child was arrested for burping and laughing in gym class. The child was handcuffed and arrested based on a New Mexico statute that makes it a misdemeanor to disrupt school activities. The child's family brought a federal 42 U.S.C. §1983 (civil rights) action against school officials and the school resource officer who made the arrest, arguing that it was a <b>false</b> <b>arrest</b> that violated the child's constitutional rights. In a 94-page majority opinion, the Tenth Circuit held that the defendants enjoyed qualified immunity from suit. Gorsuch wrote a four-page dissent, arguing that the New Mexico Court of Appeals had [...] "long ago alerted law enforcement" [...] that the statute that the officer relied upon for the child's arrest does not criminalize noises or diversions that merely disturb order in a classroom.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2000, {{evidence}} {{emerged that}} the respected veteran police officers {{known as the}} [...] "Riders" [...] had {{over the past four}} years made <b>false</b> <b>arrests,</b> planted evidence, used excessive force, and falsified police reports. Scores of drug cases were dropped because of tainted evidence. The alleged leader of the Riders, Frank Vazquez, fled to Mexico shortly after his criminal indictment and remains a fugitive from justice. The Riders' actions resulted in Oakland settling a federal civil rights case, Allen v. City of Oakland, for nearly $11 million. As part of the Negotiated Settlement Agreement, the Oakland Police Department is required to make major reforms to ensure constitutional policing. The court appointed an independent monitor to oversee implementation of these reforms.|$|R

50|$|BAMN and twenty-nine protesters {{sued the}} UC-Berkeley Chancellor Birgeneau, other administrators, UCPD, and other Alameda County Sheriffs for $15 million for {{excessive}} force, <b>false</b> <b>arrests,</b> and violation of First Amendment rights from the November 9 protests. They cited other cases where excessive forced was used on Occupy protestors and instances where camping {{was allowed to}} strengthen their case. The lawsuit {{went on for a}} number of years and the organization BAMN fought hard to present evidence and legal precedent, showing that police and administrator actions were excessive and aimed at repressing political speech. BAMN encouraged people to attend the final hearing on Sept. 10, 2013, claiming that this was a major part of the movement and without the support of the community, the protests on Nov. 9th were in vain. The outcome of the lawsuit awarded the protesters $15 million for punitive and general damages.|$|R
