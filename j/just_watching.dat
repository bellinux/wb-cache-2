Also around 120 B-Eyes by PKG, {{were obtained for}} the tour as well with lighting control from three full-sized grandMA2s and 10 NPUs. According to lighting programmer Jason Baeri, [...] "Bennett's approach to the show was {{to make it an}} immersive rave that reflected Gaga's non-stop party aesthetic... That means active, alive, vibrant and high energy—it requires us to be just as active on stage as in the crowd. The audience is every bit as much a set piece as they are a room of spectators, so we had to include them as part of Gaga's same party not <b>just</b> <b>watching</b> the spectacle from afar. Cue wise, that's almost like programming two shows at once: Both had to behave as one cohesive element." ...|$|E
500|$|The art in Ōkami {{is highly}} {{inspired}} by Japanese watercolor and wood carving {{art of the}} Ukiyo-e style, such {{as the work of}} Hokusai. Ōkami was originally planned to be rendered in a more photorealistic 3D style. However, Clover Studio determined that the more colorful sumi-e style allowed them to better convey Amaterasu's association with nature and the task of restoring it. The change was also influenced by limitations in the PS2 hardware to render the photorealistic 3D graphics. As a result of the switch to the watercolor style, the idea of the Celestial Brush came about. Atsushi Inaba, CEO of Clover, noted that [...] "Once we fixed ourselves on a graphical style and got down to the brushwork, we thought 'Wouldn't it be great if we could somehow get the player involved and participate in this artwork instead of <b>just</b> <b>watching</b> it?' That's how the idea of the Celestial Brush was born". Original concepts for enemies included the use of dinosaurs, but the designs settled onto more demon-like characters.|$|E
500|$|Like other ABC shows, Quantico has a racially-diverse cast (allowing {{viewers to}} relate {{to at least one}} character) as FBI {{recruits}} who deal with their individual problems. Safran had wanted the show to be diverse from the beginning, saying: [...] "You’re not <b>just</b> <b>watching</b> people who have struggled to achieve places of power and they’re there. This show is about the struggle to achieve that. Their politics and their racial makeup and their religious backgrounds are very important to their characterizations and who they are. I really am interested in looking at how every culture handles stress — and in particular, how people from all these different backgrounds find their place in the FBI, an agency that has historically fraught relationships with gay people and people of color." [...] The first actor cast in the series was Tate Ellington, as FBI trainee Simon Asher. Graham Rogers was then cast as another FBI trainee, Caleb Hass. It was announced that Aunjanue Ellis had signed to play Miranda Shaw, assistant director and training supervisor of the academy. Dougray Scott was then cast as Liam O'Connor, Miranda's former partner and current subordinate.|$|E

He is {{also brought}} up by his father, 4-Nova Ed, a man whose life is described as being centered on his sexual activity, and who {{is very different from}} the thoughtful and introverted Luis. Luis also has a memorable experience with the virtual reality tapes, although his occurs in adolescence. Luis subverts a program by remaining in a jungle he is supposed to walk through, and <b>just</b> <b>watching</b> the animal life around him. He sees a large spotted cat, and is [...] "transfixed" [...] by its elegance and the fact that it simply ignores him. The brief experience with [...] "wildness" [...] and independence from humans, even though it is part of a human-made program, [...] "strangely enriches" [...] his thinking. In college Luis studies to become a doctor, and also becomes interested in exploring the educational program for future generations. This leads him to uncover the angels' attempts at erasure and propaganda, and to demanding the creation of a committee on religious manipulation. His role as a conciliator following Hiroshi's announcement leads to his election as Chair of the ship's council. Eventually he also chooses to live on Hsin Ti Chiu.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were mixed}} on Parker and Stone's {{elaborate}} April Fools' Day prank. Diane Werts of Newsday {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Fans rioted. Some jumped ship and never came back.

Philip Martin of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, who said in May 1998 the South Park phenomenon was [...] "dead", described the April Fools' prank as [...] "lamentable" [...] {{and part of the}} reason for the show's apparent decline. Others, however, praised Parker and Stone for making the move at the risk of upsetting fans. Tim Clodfelter of the Winston-Salem Journal said, [...] "It was a funny, clever move [...] quickly separated the fans who truly [...] "got" [...] humor from those who were <b>just</b> <b>watching</b> for the dirty jokes." [...] Jon Casimir of The Sydney Morning Herald said, [...] "It is gratifying, in an entertainment world dominated by market research and common denominators, to see a program that obviously doesn't care if you like it or not." [...] However, he said the characterization of Terrance and Phillip was too thin to be particularly funny, and added that the novelty of the prank is lost in later years.|$|E

500|$|Drive (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) was {{released}} in CD format to stores on September 27, 2011, by Lakeshore Records, and owned by Cutting Edge Film Scores. Prior to that, owing to viral reviews such as those found on social networking website Twitter, the soundtrack sold well on iTunes, climbing as high as number four on the sales charts. The album {{was released}} on vinyl in June 2012, by Mondo. The nineteen-track album has amassed positive reviews. James Verniere of the Boston Herald graded it an A, stating, [...] "The cool crowd isn't <b>just</b> <b>watching</b> Drive; they're listening to it, too... The Drive soundtrack is such {{an integral part of}} the experience of the film, once you see it, you can't imagine the film without it." [...] AllMusic reviewer James Christopher Monger selected opening track [...] "Nightcall", [...] "I Drive", [...] "Hammer" [...] and [...] "Bride of Deluxe" [...] as soundtrack's highlights. Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy gave it a four out of five star rating, finding it as important as the film itself. She stated the album, beginning with non-Martinez songs instead of mixing it up for a more enjoyable listening experience, cost it a star. In September 2016, Lakeshore and Invada Records released a fifth anniversary special edition pressing of the soundtrack, featuring new liner notes and artwork. That same month, Johnny Jewel, College, Electric Youth, and Cliff Martinez discussed the impact of the soundtrack and film on their lives and contemporary music culture. Jewel told Vehlinggo that Drives [...] "blend of sonic and visual nostalgia with a contemporary spin is always deadly." [...] The soundtrack was listed on Spin magazine's list of 40 Movie Soundtracks That Changed Alternative Music.|$|E

[...] Simon Gage of Daily Express awarded it four out of five stars, complimenting Beyoncé's dance moves and praising her vocal capabilities, going on saying that she is [...] "probably the most electric performer since Tina Turner" [...] and calling her the [...] "Queen of R". She also praised the quality of the songs [...] "Crazy In Love", [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] and [...] "Halo". Ian Drew of Us Weekly complimented the [...] "high-energy performances" [...] of Beyoncé on her Destiny's Child songs and enjoyed the black-and-white behind-the-scenes footage. He also added that the singer is [...] "most revelatory when tearing up over [...] missing husband Jay-Z on the road." [...] New Yorks Amy Odell described the DVD as a [...] "cinematic masterpiece". Jam!s Darryl Sterdan gave the album a rating of three-and-a-half stars out of five and said, [...] "More than two hours of powerhouse vocal performances and high-energy choreography, accompanied by endless costume changes, eye-popping production and general fabulousness. You'll get tired <b>just</b> <b>watching</b> it." [...] Scott Kara of The New Zealand Herald awarded it three out of five stars, stating that the good thing about the DVD is that it has a [...] "wider range of songs", nevertheless {{they do not have the}} same [...] "rump-rattling power" [...] of the songs in The Beyoncé Experience simply because some songs are too short in duration, for instance [...] "Bootylicious".

[...] Miranda loves singing and, despite – {{or perhaps}} because of – the satire, becomes an {{evocation}} of something all humans love to do and have done since before we discovered language. The very act of singing, however dire the sound, makes us feel good." [...] Ballinger noted that the TV show Glee (to which Miranda submitted an [...] "audition" [...] in 2010) is causing a resurgence of interest in singing in schools: [...] "Everyone is talking about Glee and choirs and musical theatre, igniting a flame that has been dimmed for a long time. ... Live performance and musical theatre were almost a lost art ... people need to be reminded that it takes a lot more effort to sing than <b>just</b> <b>watching</b> movies or TV shows." [...] Miranda followed up on this idea, saying: [...] "Since I became so famous ... everyone is watching more music and singing more – because everyone wants to be more like me." [...] As the Miranda character matured, its popularity grew especially with younger audiences of the Glee generation, with most of those attending her concerts being teenagers or in their twenties.

[...] Hahn Nguyen of Zap2it wrote: [...] "seeing it live is well worth the money and effort. Not only is there an elevated, infectious energy you don't get from <b>just</b> <b>watching</b> the show at home, but the feeling of togetherness can't be matched." [...] and [...] "One can truly hear the quality of the live vocals, which in the case of Lea Michele is the real deal. She sounds even better than on the show...Her [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade" [...] live is an amazing and thrilling treat." [...] Variety Andrew Barker gave a less favorable review, writing: [...] "while its distinctive blend of high camp and recognizable tunes may click on the small screen, when translated to stage the conceit becomes little more than a frantic, under-imagined jukeboxer, and only occasionally a well-performed one. Four-city tour will likely rake in the cash and merit a reprise, but whether it deserves it is a different matter."

2500|$|Snowden's first {{television}} interview aired January 26, 2014, on Germany's NDR. In April 2014, {{he appeared on}} video from an undisclosed location during President Putin's live annual Q exchange with the public. Snowden asked whether Russia intercepted, stored or analyzed individuals' communications. Putin replied, [...] "Russia uses surveillance techniques for spying on individuals only with the sanction of a court order. This is our law, and therefore there is no mass surveillance in our country." [...] Benjamin Wittes in The New Republic described the exchange as [...] "a highly-scripted propaganda stunt for Vladimir Putin". Snowden insisted his question was designed to hold the Russian president accountable. In an op-ed for The Guardian, Snowden said his question was intended [...] "to mirror the now infamous exchange in US Senate intelligence committee hearings between senator Ron Wyden {{and the director of}} national intelligence, James Clapper, about whether the NSA collected records on millions of Americans, and to invite either an important concession or a clear evasion." [...] Snowden called Putin's response [...] "evasive". A few days later, The Daily Beast reported that Snowden himself [...] "instantly regretted" [...] asking Putin the [...] "softball question", which was crafted with several of his key advisers, and that he was mortified by the reaction. Ben Wizner, one of Snowden's legal advisers, told the Beast that Snowden hadn't realized how much his appearance with Putin would be seen as a Kremlin propaganda victory. [...] "I know this is hard to believe," [...] Wizner acknowledged. [...] "I know if I was <b>just</b> <b>watching</b> from afar, I'd think, 'Wow, they forced him to do this.' But it's not true. He just fucking did it." [...] Asked six months later about the incident, Snowden conceded, [...] "Yeah, that was terrible! Oh, Jesus, that blew up in my face. ...
