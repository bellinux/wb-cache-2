While trying {{to dispose of}} Alejandro's car, Bree and Gabrielle inadvertently attract Chuck's attention and {{have to create a}} series of elaborate lies to avoid him finding out the truth. Later, Bree receives a note reading, [...] "I know what you did. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>sick.</b> I'm going to tell."

In a box of Mary Alice's clothes, the women {{discover}} a blackmail note reading [...] "I {{know what you did}} <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>sick</b> I'm going to tell" [...] The postmark indicates that Mary Alice received it the day she killed herself and the women begin to wonder what secret their friend could have been keeping.|$|E
500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>sick</b> to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a thing going on now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people. God bless the gay people. They are great people." ...|$|E

500|$|Paul asks Mary Alice’s {{neighbors and}} friends, Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Bree (Marcia Cross) and Gabrielle (Eva Longoria), {{to go through}} her clothes and other {{belongings}} and then pack them up, as he thinks {{it will be too}} hard for him. The women end up finding a letter addressed to Mary Alice, a blackmail note reading, [...] "I know what you did, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>sick,</b> I’m going to tell." [...] Thereafter, the women make a series of discoveries concerning Mary Alice’s past and her possible motives for ending her life; she was being treated by Dr. Albert Goldfine (Sam Lloyd) where she revealed that she once went by the name Angela, and she may {{have had something to do}} with a baby that went missing. [...] Paul soon discovers who sent Mary Alice the note, their next-door neighbor struggling with financial difficulty, Martha Huber (Christine Estabrook), whom he ends up strangling to death out of pure rage and burying her body in the nearby forest. Meanwhile, her son Zach begins having flashbacks and is under the impression he killed a baby named Dana, who he believed to be his younger sister and reveals this to Julie Mayer (Andrea Bowen), Susan’s daughter. Paul worries over what Susan is spreading about their family, so he tells Susan in private that Zach accidentally killed his younger sister, Dana, and that he and Mary Alice covered it up to protect him. However, it becomes evident that this is not the case when Paul tells Zach that Dana is still very much alive.|$|E
