In this work {{the propagation of}} electromagnetic radiation emitted from partial discharge in high voltage insulating materials is investigated. Three common dielectric materials used in power industry: polymer, epoxy resin and ceramics are studied. The results obtained are envisaged to support the development of appropriate sensors for partial discharge detection. The radiation pattern is dependent on a multitude of parameters. Among these, the intensity distribution of the source {{as well as the}} dielectric material and its geometry are the main parameters. Significant differences in the radiation spectra are obtained for insulators made of ceramic material compare to non-ceramic insulators...|$|E
