5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in the sea and again, {{the high cost of}} this project meant that <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened.</b> This was a large issue in the area during the whole of the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In a B plot, Andy (Chris Pratt) {{is doing}} well in his new job as the Pawnee shoeshiner, and Ron pays for a shine. Ron is {{impressed}} when Andy actually eases the pain from his bunion, and he later purposely scuffs his shoe {{so he can get}} a second shine. Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary noise that sounds like a sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide {{it would be best to}} simply pretend <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, at two Cabinet {{meetings}} held on 1 April 1965, it {{was decided}} to cancel the TSR-2 on the grounds of projected cost, and instead to obtain an option agreement to acquire up to 110 F-111 aircraft with no immediate commitment to buy. This decision was announced in the budget speech of 6 April 1965. The maiden flight of the second development batch aircraft, XR220, was due {{on the day of the}} announcement, but following an accident in conveying the airframe to Boscombe Down, coupled with the announcement of the project cancellation, <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened.</b> Ultimately, only the first prototype, XR219, ever took to the air. A week later, the Chancellor defended the decision in a debate in the House of Commons, saying that the F-111 would prove cheaper.|$|E

25|$|Carson {{was head}} {{of a group of}} investors who {{purchased}} and operated two television stations. The first was KVVU-TV in Henderson, Nevada, an independent station serving Las Vegas, acquired by the Carson group in 1979. Shortly after buying the station, KVVU was rumored to be acquiring an NBC affiliation as then long-time affiliate KORK-TV {{was in the process of}} being replaced by KVBC (and now KSNV), but <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened.</b> Carson's second station, independent KNAT-TV in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was purchased in 1982. Unlike the Las Vegas operation, KNAT faced stiffer competition for top-quality, syndicated programming. Carson sold both of his stations between 1985 and 1986 with KVVU-TV (FOX 5) going to the James Meredith Corporation and KNAT being sold to Trinity Broadcasting Network.|$|E

In Branco's opinion, the push toward the storyline was the reason Howarth eventually left OLTL for As the World Turns. By contrast, at a fan gathering in 2008, St. John joked about Todd and Marty bonding during the Carlivati storyline, stating, [...] "I'm all for gang rape."

It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] In 2006, Jordan accused Evan of attacking him with a barbell, choking him and spraying his face with Mace. The charges were later dropped. On November 5, 2009, fourteen weeks after Jackson's death, Evan Chandler was found dead following an apparent suicide.|$|E
500|$|The People v. Jackson {{trial began}} in Santa Maria, California, on January 31, 2005.

However, Jordan Chandler {{had left the}} country to avoid testifying. In a lecture at Harvard after the trial, Thomas Mesereau said, [...] "The prosecutors {{tried to get him}} to show up and he wouldn't.

BuddyTV wrote that, [...] "Nothing spells rivalry like the {{on-going}} feud between Jill Foster Abbott and Katherine Chancellor." [...] In 1993, Katherine {{was diagnosed with breast}} cancer and shared several tender scenes with Jill. Nancy Reichardt of the Los Angeles Times noted that the characters were acting out of character; she wrote: [...] "Katherine's breast cancer scare was touching and seeing Katherine and Jill come together added an intriguing new dimension to their relationship. To confuse us, the show has thrown out this budding friendship as if <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened.</b> How much more moving it would have been if these two women faced Katherine's request for Jill to name her child Phillip as former adversaries trying to put the past behind them instead of as bitter enemies of days gone by." [...] Of working with Cooper, Walton has stated: [...] "I thank God every day for that woman. She feeds me. She is like a shot in the arm when you see her in the morning.

500|$|Two weeks later, {{he played}} his 100th AFL match in the sixty-eight point loss to Fremantle at the MCG in round five, {{a game in}} which he managed just seven disposals; after his {{milestone}} match he was condemned by Matthew Lloyd on the Nine Network's Footy Classified, saying [...] "he's been gifted 100 games of AFL football". In the thirty-eight point loss against Sydney at the MCG the next week, he started as the substitute with Paul Roos attempting to ease the burden on Watts, although Roos later admitted starting as the substitute probably increased pressure on Watts. The relentless pressure on Watts saw him omitted the next week for the round seven match against , although it initially appeared he was dropped by the coaching panel, it was later revealed by Paul Roos that Watts asked to be dropped so he could find form playing in the VFL. Leigh Matthews described Watts' decision to drop himself as a shock because <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> in his twenty years of coaching and he found it difficult to take seriously. Recording twenty-four disposals, eight marks and a goal in the VFL, his performance was described as [...] "solid" [...] by AFL Media journalist, Peter Ryan and he was recalled to the senior side after the one week in the VFL for the thirty-nine point win against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Westley {{bought a}} {{controlling}} interest in Farnborough Town and appointed himself as manager. He managed {{the club to}} a 12th-place finish {{in his first season}} in charge, but enjoyed success in the Isthmian Cup; winning the competition in 2000. The following season, Westley guided the club to more success, winning the Isthmian League Premier Division; securing 31 victories out of a possible 42 and amassing a total of 99 points. Westley overhauled the squad shortly after the club's promotion to the Football Conference â€“ something which he now states as a [...] "huge regret". At this point, he also tried to arrange a merger with Kingstonian â€“ citing the club's [...] "Football League rated ground" [...] as the reasoning behind his proposed idea, although <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>happened</b> due to [...] "fans resistance". [...] During the 2001â€“02 season, the club consolidated their position in the first tier of nonâ€“league football; with Westley guiding the club to a 7th-place finish in the league. The following season was to be a memorable campaign for Westley, reaching the Third Round of the FA Cup after a 3â€“0 victory at Southport, where they faced Football League competition in the form of Darlington at Feethams. Westley guided the side to a 3â€“2 win over Darlington, and the club were rewarded with a Fourth Round tie at home to Arsenal. The tie, however, was controversially moved to Highbury â€“ because the tie stood to make around Â£600,000 in gate receipts from playing at Highbury, whereas playing at Cherrywood Road would only have generated the club an estimated Â£50,000. Westley left the club after the sell-out 'home' tie at Highbury, which they lost 5â€“1. Shortly after his resignation, he became manager at Football Conference rivals Stevenage in January 2003, signing a three-year contract. Westley confirmed he would be leaving his shareholding in Farnborough to other existing shareholders, and would also be withdrawing his financial backing at the club. On moving to Stevenage, Westley said [...] "I've enjoyed my time at Farnborough, but I feel that I need to move on now and that I need to concentrate on football management, which is where my ambitions lie". He went on to state that Stevenage's [...] "long-term potential" [...] was another key factor behind the move.|$|E
