5|$|It's good to <b>know</b> <b>people</b> didn't see it coming. That's a {{big concern}} when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
25|$|As Sun He was intelligent, Sun Quan favoured him {{and often}} kept {{him by his}} side. Sun Quan also treated Sun He {{exceptionally}} well; he gave Sun He new clothes, ornaments, toys and other gifts, but did not {{do the same for}} his other sons. Sun Quan's subjects also highly regarded Sun He because he was not only bright, perceptive and well-versed in literary arts, horse-riding and archery, but also respectful and courteous towards his tutors and elders. He was genuinely interested in getting to <b>know</b> <b>people.</b> In 247, Sun Quan ordered Zhuge Yi (諸葛壹) to pretend to defect to Wu's rival state, Wei, and lure the Wei general Zhuge Dan into a trap. When Sun Quan personally led the Wu forces to attack Zhuge Dan, Sun He showed grave concern about his father: he could not rest and have his meals in peace, repeatedly reminded his father to be careful, and hoped that his father would win the battle. He only put aside his worries upon seeing his father return safely to Wu.|$|E

500|$|Burton [...] "loved the idea" [...] {{of playing}} a {{character}} [...] "very different" [...] from Jason Morgan, who was characterized as [...] "Stone Cold". The role of Dylan {{allowed him to}} wear colors other than black, which he was famed for at General Hospital. Of returning to daytime television without Jason Morgan's [...] "uniform" [...] and [...] "black T-shirt", Burton described the experience as [...] "refreshing". Explaining his wardrobe process, he said: [...] "I never had to try stuff on. I'm not used to wardrobe fittings. I had to try on about 20 different outfits! That was really grueling. It was important to shake the leather coat and black t-shirt and do my hair different, because I <b>know</b> <b>people</b> {{are always going to}} see me as Jason." ...|$|E

So, you <b>know,</b> <b>people</b> are just kicking it around like that." [...] Actor Bob Balaban, who portrayed NBC executive Warren Littlefield in The Late Shift {{said he would like}} to portray Jeff Zucker, and said Jason Alexander would also be a good choice to play Zucker. Andy Richter jokingly told Movieline that he would want Justin Bieber to portray him in a film adaptation of the book.|$|E

[...] When asked if her accent [...] "sounded realistic", he noted, [...] "I'm {{going to go with}} that. I <b>know</b> <b>people</b> who sound like that." [...] In response to the accent, Moore explained [...] "I went to school in Boston and worked with a lot of guys from Dorchester, so that's where [...] came from.

Like you talk about Northern Ireland, 'Sunday Bloody Sunday,' people sort of think, 'Oh, that time when 13 Catholics were shot by British soldiers'; that's not what the song is about. That's an incident, the most famous incident in Northern Ireland and it's the strongest way of saying, 'How long? How long {{do we have to}} put up with this?' I don't care who's who – Catholics, Protestants, whatever. You <b>know</b> <b>people</b> are dying every single day through bitterness and hate, and we're saying why? What's the point? And you can move that into places like El Salvador and other similar situations – people dying. Let's forget the politics, let's stop shooting each other and sit around the table and talk about it... There are a lot of bands taking sides saying politics is crap, etc. Well, so what! The real battle is people dying, that's the real battle." ...|$|E
500|$|In the episode, Bart {{appears on}} the talk show Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Conan O'Brien was a writer for The Simpsons during the fourth and {{early part of the}} fifth seasons. During the {{production}} of the episode, he received an audition to replace David Letterman as the host of Late Night on NBC, after Letterman defected to CBS. The writers decided that since the episode featured Bart getting famous, it would give them an opportunity to work in O'Brien's show. The part was written just after O'Brien's audition for Late Night, but before he {{knew he was going to}} be the host. O'Brien recorded his part shortly after Late Night with Conan O'Brien premiered, but he believed NBC would have fired him before the episode aired. He described being a guest star on the show as [...] "really delightful", adding that [...] "it's like being frozen in amber. I <b>know</b> <b>people</b> will be watching The Simpsons long after I'm dead." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1993, Brown {{decided to}} quit EastEnders after {{becoming}} [...] "discontented" [...] {{with the way}} Dot was portrayed. In 1997 she revealed to the Daily Mirror: [...] "I always felt Dot {{was one of those}} characters who should stay the same. She's a simple creature. There are some people who the same things happen to them again and again. They never learn [...] When I left, there was all that rubbish about it getting too much for me [...] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'. It wasn't being written properly. Instead of finding the gossip and passing it on, [...] [...] was living on a reputation. [...] said to me, 'I loved it when [...] had [...] varicose veins.' I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. I was getting so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some good stories coming up." [...] Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she [...] "didn’t like what they were doing with Dot– she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing I <b>know,</b> <b>people</b> are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‘No, this just won’t do’. I was very annoyed, I felt like they had completely changed my character." [...] The character departed on-screen in August 1993, when Dot moved away from the soap's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend, Kent.|$|E

Bieber said, [...] "It's really awesome {{to be able to work}} with professional dancers, you <b>know,</b> <b>people</b> that were in, like, ABDC, and also got an approval from choreographer Jamaica, who said Bieber was [...] "killing it" [...] and that she didn't have to give him any corrections. It made its premiere during the June 17, 2010 results show of the seventh season of So You Think You Can Dance, and was introduced by Usher after his performance of [...] "OMG". It later premiered that night on VEVO and on June 18, 2010 on 20/20. The video features dance crews including, America's Best Dance Crew season 5 winners Poreotics, and Season 3's runner up Beat Freaks, as well as The Syrenz, LXD, Medea Sirkas, solo acts Simrin Player and Bboy Fly, and other dancers and crews. Singer/actress and model Katerina Graham makes a cameo in a scene with Poreotics. Bieber's best friend Ryan Butler, who appeared in the [...] "One Time" [...] video, also appears alongside Bieber, wearing a T-shirt advertising his Twitter account.

500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, likening it to [...] "being mugged {{by a professional}} whose skills in mixed martial arts you can't help but notice and appreciate, even as you are savagely beaten, then dragged upright, bruised and bleeding, and forced to watch as your assailant gives fully 45% of your money to charity." [...] Christy Lemire writing for Roger Ebert's website gave it two stars out of four and criticized the film for being [...] "emotionally inert, despite its many moments that are meant to put a lump in our throats." [...] Lemire criticized Elgort's performance and praised Woodley's [...] "abiding, disarming naturalism." [...] Robbie Collin writing for The Daily Telegraph said: [...] "Gus {{is something of a}} manic pixie dreamboat: the lesser-spotted male version of the kooky, adoring girlfriend-type sometimes played by Kirsten Dunst, Natalie Portman, and Zooey Deschanel." [...] David Edelstein of NPR said: I <b>know</b> <b>people</b> who cried at the trailer of the romantic teen cancer movie The Fault in Our Starsat the movie they'll need a life preserver to keep from drowning in a flood of tears. Me, I didn't cry, though at times my tear ducts tingled; I was on the verge. The film is a little slick for my taste, too engineered. But it's gently directed by Josh Boone and beautifully acted. Whatever the faults, it's not in the stars. Shalini Langer of The Indian Express gave the film {{two and a half stars}} and said: [...] "The film is faithful to a fault from the dialogues to the clothes, the setting and the food, even while skipping over some of the unpleasant details."
