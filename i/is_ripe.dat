5|$|The {{prominent}} flower spikes are {{visited by}} many birds and insects. Honeyeaters are common visitors, particularly the New Holland honeyeater, {{as well as}} the fuscous honeyeater, western wattlebird and western spinebill. Other birds recorded foraging include the grey butcherbird and species of thornbill. Insects recorded include ants, bees, wasps, butterflies, moths, flies and beetles. The short-billed black cockatoo breaks off old cones with follicles to eat the seed, often doing so before the seed <b>is</b> <b>ripe.</b>|$|E
5|$|Narcissus {{plants have}} one to several basal leaves which are linear, ligulate or strap shaped (long and narrow), {{sometimes}} channelled adaxially to semiterete, and may (pedicellate) {{or may not}} (sessile) have a petiole stalk. The leaves are flat and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb. The emerging plant generally has two leaves, but the mature plant usually three, rarely four, and they are covered with a cutin containing cuticle, giving them a waxy appearance. Leaf colour is light green to blue-green. In the mature plant the leaves extend higher than the flower stem, but in some species the leaves are low hanging. The leaf base is encased in a colourless sheath. After flowering the leaves turn yellow and die back once the seed pod (fruit) <b>is</b> <b>ripe.</b>|$|E
5|$|Occurring {{in spring}} (August to October), {{the bright red}} or orange-red inflorescences are {{terminal}} and well displayed, and consist of anywhere from 10 to 52 individual flowers split into smaller groups of 2 to 20 flowers, arranged in a corymb. The flowers sit atop stalks (known as pedicels) up to 3.5cm (1.6in) in length, which arise in pairs off main horizontal stalks within the inflorescence. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth up to 4cm (1.8in) long, which partly splits along one side at anthesis to release the thick style. The stigma is contained within a slanting disc-like structure {{at the tip of}} the style. The tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip, and the anther lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The pedicel and the outer surface of the perianth are pubescent (covered in short fine fur). Flowers are followed by woody rectangular seed pods that sit on long stalks, and are 7–10cm (2.8–4in) long. Each pod contains 8 to 10seeds, and <b>is</b> <b>ripe</b> in February and March. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself. The seedlings have obovate cotyledons that are 0.8–1cm (0.3–0.4in) wide by 1cm (0.4in) long.|$|E

25|$|Firm kiwifruit ripen after a {{few days}} to a week when stored at room temperature, but should not be kept in direct sunlight. Faster {{ripening}} occurs when placed in a paper bag with an apple, pear, or banana. Once a kiwifruit <b>is</b> <b>ripe,</b> however, it is preserved optimally when stored far from other fruits, as it is very sensitive to the ethylene gas they may emit, thereby tending to over-ripen even in the refrigerator. If stored appropriately, ripe kiwifruit normally keep for about one to two weeks.|$|E
25|$|The {{fruit is}} a {{leathery}} capsule, broadly oval in shape. These contain five spaces that split open outwards {{from the base}} of the style when the fruit <b>is</b> <b>ripe</b> by April. Each space contains two shiny black seeds that are shaped like a slightly curved tear drop of 6×3mm, and are partly covered by a conspicuous scarlet aril, both of which starkly contrast with the horny white inside of the fruit (or mericarp). Aborted seeds are greyish. The embryo is green. Ixerba has fifty chromosomes (2n = 50).|$|E

25|$|Plants in {{the area}} {{typically}} have large responses to the change in climate with each season. Monsoon season is the largest of these effects, with leaf buds following {{only a few months}} after the rains begin. Flowering season occurs in the months preceding the summer monsoon. This is only the peak flowering season, with plants flowering throughout the year. Due to the early flowering, fruit <b>is</b> <b>ripe</b> and seeds are dispersed at the beginning of the rains. There are also areas where plants have little response to the seasons, particularly those areas that experience moist conditions, caused by the elevations. These plants may maintain leaves through times when other areas are in the dry season, during which most deciduous trees have no leaves.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} cuisine of Ivory Coast is {{very similar}} to that of neighboring countries in West Africa in its reliance on grains and tubers. Cassava and plantains are significant parts of Ivorian cuisine. A type of corn paste called aitiu is used to prepare corn balls, and peanuts are widely used in many dishes. Attiéké is a popular side dish in Ivory Coast made with grated cassava and is a vegetable-based couscous. A common street food is alloco, which <b>is</b> <b>ripe</b> banana fried in palm oil, spiced with steamed onions and chili and eaten alone or with grilled fish. Chicken is commonly consumed and has a unique flavor due to its lean, low-fat mass in this region. Seafood includes tuna, sardines, shrimp, and bonito, which is similar to tuna. Mafé is a common dish consisting of meat in a peanut sauce.|$|E

25|$|Given the {{versatility}} of both vegetables, {{they were}} usually boiled or steamed, and eaten by itself or as ingredients in soups and strews. Without {{the need for}} advanced agricultural technology, taro and sweet potatoes were a prime preference for farming. Canadian missionary George MacKay said of 19th century Taiwan: ‘the bulb of the sweet potato is planted in March. In about six weeks the vines are cut into pieces eight inches long, which are planted in drills, and from these vine-cuttings the bulbs grow and are ripe {{about the end of}} June. A second crop is planted in a similar way in July and <b>is</b> <b>ripe</b> in November.’ (Ibid). The influence of sweet potatoes and taro has been vast. They are still widely present in modern-day Taiwan, be it on the streets, night markets, or in successful food chains like ‘Meet Fresh’ (or 鮮芋仙).|$|E
25|$|Malthus went on {{to argue}} that under such ideal conditions, the {{population}} could conceivably double every 25 years. However, the food supply could not continue doubling at this rate for even 50 years. The food supply would become inadequate for the growing population, and then:...the mighty law of self-preservation expels all the softer and more exalted emotions of the soul.... The corn is plucked before it <b>is</b> <b>ripe,</b> or secreted in unfair proportions; and the whole black train of vices that belong to falsehood are immediately generated. Provisions no longer flow in {{for the support of}} the mother with a large family. The children are sickly from insufficient food.... No human institutions here existed, to the perverseness of which Mr. Godwin ascribes the original sin of the worst men. No opposition had been produced by them between public and private good. No monopoly had been created of those advantages which reason directs to be left in common. No man had been goaded to the breach of order by unjust laws. Benevolence had established her reign in all hearts: and yet in so short a period as within fifty years, violence, oppression, falsehood, misery, every hateful vice, and every form of distress, which degrade and sadden the present state of society, seem to have been generated by the most imperious circumstances, by laws inherent in the nature of man, and absolutely independent of it human regulations.|$|E

500|$|Bowlby's {{attention}} was first drawn to ethology {{when he read}} Konrad Lorenz's 1952 publication in draft form (although Lorenz had published earlier work). Other important influences were ethologists Nikolaas Tinbergen and Robert Hinde. Bowlby subsequently collaborated with Hinde. In 1953 Bowlby stated [...] "the time <b>is</b> <b>ripe</b> for a unification of psychoanalytic concepts with those of ethology, and to pursue the rich vein of research which this union suggests." [...] Konrad Lorenz had examined the phenomenon of [...] "imprinting", a behaviour characteristic of some birds and mammals which involves rapid learning of recognition by the young, of a [...] or comparable object.

Gandhi thought the Zionists in Palestine represented European imperialism and used violence to achieve their goals; he argued that [...] "the Jews should disclaim any intention of realizing their aspiration {{under the protection of}} arms and should rely wholly on the goodwill of Arabs. No exception can possibly be taken to the natural desire of the Jews to find a home in Palestine. But they must wait for its fulfillment till Arab opinion <b>is</b> <b>ripe</b> for it." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} other {{characteristics}} of B.prionotes {{can be understood as}} secondary responses to weak serotiny. For example, winter flowering ensures that seed <b>is</b> <b>ripe</b> {{by the beginning of the}} bushfire season; this is very important for weakly serotinous species, which rely heavily upon the current year's seed crop. Another example is the deciduous florets of B.prionotes. In strongly serotinous species, the old florets are retained on the cones, where they function as fire fuel, helping to ensure that follicles reach temperatures sufficient to trigger seed release. In B.prionotes, however, seed release is triggered at relatively low temperatures: in one study, 50% of follicles opened at , and 90% opened at in contrast, the closely related but strongly serotinous B. hookeriana required [...] respectively. Floret retention would therefore be to no advantage, and might even prevent seed from escaping spontaneously opened follicles.|$|E
