5|$|At first, {{the film}} was on a tight budget; Giddens used his entire savings and mortgaged his house to raise money, saying that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> to impress ex-girlfriend, who {{provided}} the inspiration for this film's female protagonist, Shen Chia-yi.

5|$|Schindler {{joined the}} separatist Sudeten German Party in 1935. Although {{he was a}} citizen of Czechoslovakia, Schindler became a spy for the Abwehr, an {{intelligence}} service of Nazi Germany, in 1936. He was assigned to Abwehrstelle II Commando VIII, based in Breslau. He later told Czech police that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> because he needed the money; by this time Schindler had a drinking problem and was chronically in debt.|$|E
5|$|When Æthelred made a {{grant to}} Berkeley Abbey in 883, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> with the {{approval}} of King Alfred, thus acknowledging Alfred's lordship. Thereafter he usually acted with Alfred's permission, but issued some charters in his own name without reference to Alfred, such as at a meeting in Risborough in Buckinghamshire in 884, showing that English Mercia extended quite far south-east towards London.|$|E

5|$|Along with Bork, {{the other}} most {{contentious}} Supreme Court nomination in United States {{history has been}} the one for Clarence Thomas. When the Thomas hearings began in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express an opinion about Roe v. Wade, but the nomination appeared headed for success. But when the sexual harassment charges by Anita Hill broke the following month, and the nomination battle dominated public discourse, Kennedy was hamstrung by his past reputation and the ongoing developments in the William Kennedy Smith case. He said almost nothing until {{the third day of}} the Thomas–Hill hearings, and when <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> was criticized by Hill supporters for being too little, too late.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Kinsler hit 20 {{home runs}} (leading all AL second basemen) and was 23-for-25 in stolen base {{attempts}} (a 92% success rate). He {{was one of}} only six batters in the AL to have at least 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases, along with Alex Rodriguez, Gary Sheffield, Grady Sizemore, B.J. Upton, and Curtis Granderson. He also became the sixth player in franchise history to reach the 20–20 plateau, joining Alfonso Soriano (2005), Iván Rodríguez (1999), Rafael Palmeiro (1993), Bobby Bonds (1978), and Toby Harrah (1975 and 1977). <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> despite his stress fracture, which kept him under 500 at bats. His 23 stolen bases and 96 runs led the Rangers.|$|E

Edward takes responsibility for the robbery, telling a surprised Kim <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> because she asked him to. Edward is shunned by the neighborhood except for the Boggs.|$|E

5|$|Frustrated that Gee {{refuses to}} {{consider}} the possibility of a police shooting, Pembleton assures him he will get a confession out of Staley, whether <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> or not. Pembleton starts the interrogation calm and polite, but gradually becomes angrier, frightening Staley. Pembleton makes him feel responsible for allowing Cox to be at the crackhouse, and uses that guilt to break Staley down and confess, even though he is obviously innocent. Pembleton gives the confession to Gee, who is conflicted, especially when Pembleton compares it to past police practices of white detectives getting confessions from black suspects no matter what the cost. Ultimately, Gee tears up the confession and instead visits Staley at jail. Staley admits to Gee that Lt. Jimmy Tyron (Michael S. Kennedy) shot Cox in the back without warning while Cox was running away. Pembleton and Bayliss arrest Tyron at his home, where they confiscate a gun and bullets that appear to match those used against Cox. The arrest deeply saddens Howard, who had previously had an affair with Tyron. The affair ended because Tyron was married with children, but Howard continues to harbor romantic feelings for him.|$|E
5|$|In flashbacks, it is {{revealed}} that as children Tifa and Cloud {{had decided to}} follow a path to a mountain near their hometown of Nibelheim. However, they were both injured and Tifa {{was in a coma}} for a week, with her father holding Cloud responsible for the incident. Cloud eventually left to join Shinra's SOLDIER program in order to become stronger, but it is later revealed that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> primarily to attract her attention. In response, she requested if she was ever in danger, he would return to save her. Years later, after Sephiroth destroyed the town of Nibelheim, Cloud rescued Tifa after she was wounded by Sephiroth. Surviving the incident, Tifa was taken to safety by her martial arts instructor Zangan, eventually arriving in Midgar and meeting AVALANCHE's leader, Barret Wallace. Upon recovering, she joined AVALANCHE so as to get revenge for the destruction of her home.

5|$|What is most {{important}} for us, out of the heathen fancy of a kidnapping man of the moon, which, apart from Scandinavia, was doubtless in vogue all over Teutondom, if not farther, there has evolved itself since a Christian adaptation. They say {{the man in the}} moon is a wood-stealer, who during church time on the holy sabbath committed a trespass in the wood, and was then transported to the moon as a punishment; there he may be seen with the axe on his back and the bundle of brushwood (dornwelle) in his hand. Plainly enough the water-pole of the heathen story has been transformed into the axe's shaft, and the carried pail into the thornbrush; the general idea of theft was retained, but special stress laid on the keeping of the christian holiday; the man suffers punishment not so much for cutting firewood, as because <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> on Sunday.|$|E
5|$|Justice David Josiah Brewer's {{death on}} March 28, 1910 gave Taft a second {{opportunity}} {{to fill a}} seat on the high court; he chose New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes. Taft told Hughes that should the chief justiceship fall vacant during his term, Hughes would be his likely choice for the center seat. The Senate quickly confirmed Hughes, but then Chief Justice Fuller died on July 4, 1910. Taft took five months to replace Fuller, and when <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>it</b> was with Justice Edward Douglass White, who became the first associate justice to be promoted to chief justice. According to Lurie, Taft, who still had hopes of being chief justice, may have been more willing to appoint an older man than he (White) than a younger one (Hughes), who might outlive him, as indeed Hughes did. To fill White's seat as associate justice, Taft appointed Willis Van Devanter of Wyoming, a federal appeals judge. By the time Taft nominated White and Van Devanter in December 1910, he had another seat to fill due to William Henry Moody's retirement because of illness; he named a Louisiana Democrat, Joseph R. Lamar, whom he had met while playing golf, and had subsequently learned had a good reputation as a judge.|$|E

Vanessa witnesses the scene and becomes cold towards him. Rhys apologises to Susan and opens up to Vanessa about why <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
