40|$|Educators’ {{perceptions}} influence academic protocols {{regarding the}} level at which evidence-based <b>design</b> is introduced <b>to</b> <b>design</b> students. Evidence-based design, a research methodology based on quantitative and qualitative inquiry that informs design decisions, permeated healthcare <b>design</b> <b>to</b> the point that the two are almost synonymous (Hamilton 2 ̆ 6 Watkins, 2009; Nussbaumer, 2009). As this research based approach spreads throughout the profession, multiple specialty areas in architecture and interior design adopt evidence-based design into their methodologies (Hamilton 2 ̆ 6 Watkins, 2009). These “developments in design practice now impinge directly upon education” (Zuo, Leonard, 2 ̆ 6 MaloneBeach, 2010, p. 269). Teaching evidence-based <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>design</b> students prepares entry-level designers for the workplace (Nussbaumer, 2009). This research study explores and explains educator perceptions about teaching evidence-based <b>design</b> <b>to</b> beginning <b>design</b> students through surveys administered to National Conference on the Beginning Design Student 2011 attendees and Interior Design Educators Council members. Results showed numerous views. Those in favor of introducing evidence-based <b>design</b> <b>to</b> beginning <b>design</b> students present the method along with the design process. These educators believe evidence-based design forms a basis for design and is an important research/design methodology. Educators against introducing evidence-based <b>design</b> <b>to</b> beginning <b>design</b> students believe the method requires too much information to cover at the beginning level and stifles creativity. Other educators either had little knowledge or were unaware of evidence-based design. Most educators surveyed teach human factors, ergonomics, anthropometrics, and Proxemics, but are not aware that evidence-based design includes these topics. Many state they have no plans <b>to</b> incorporate evidence-based <b>design</b> into their beginning design courses because it is taught in upper-level courses. Educators conveyed openness toward introducing evidence-based <b>design</b> <b>to</b> beginning <b>design</b> students, especially if proven beneficial to the students. Most educators rely on colleagues and teaching publications to learn about evidence-based design. Overall, educators perceive the most significant factor regarding future introduction of evidence-based <b>design</b> <b>to</b> beginning <b>design</b> students <b>to</b> be faculty related. This research acknowledged limitations and future research directions...|$|R
