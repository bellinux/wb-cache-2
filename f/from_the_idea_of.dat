5|$|Kohli {{conceived}} Teri Meri Kahaani <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> soulmates, {{showing the}} strength of love beyond generations by having the same two actors portray all three couples without using a reincarnation theme. He co-wrote the film with Robin Bhatt. Muneesh Sappel created three sets for depicting the different time periods, requiring months of research and detailed designs. Principal photography began in Mumbai in mid-2011 and later moved to London, where it was primarily shot at the Jublee Campus of the University of Nottingham and Stratford-upon-Avon.|$|E
5|$|Geneforge stemmed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{creating}} {{a horde of}} creatures {{and the ability to}} care for those creatures or send them to their deaths. The choice was to be made by the player. From this point, Vogel considered who would be able to gain such powers, how they would control them and how these creatures would be treated. The game was developed with the intention of giving players choices; which factions to side with, how non-Shaper human outsiders are treated and whether to pursue goals through combat or diplomacy. Unlike most role-playing games, Geneforge was designed so that {{it would be possible to}} complete the game without using violence. Vogel cited , , Deus Ex and EverQuest as influences.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{conceived}} South of Nowhere <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a teenager's {{coming out}} after hearing that his friend's son {{had come out}} to his parents. Lynch pitched the premise to The N and was commissioned to write the pilot. After the casting process was complete, the episode was filmed in October 2004, but when the show was picked up for a full season, Lynch decided to recast many of the characters and the pilot was shot again in July 2005 with the new cast. The premiere of the episode was promoted with branded MetroCards that were handed out to teenagers in Manhattan. Generally, critics reviewed the pilot positively, particularly commending its treatment of current social issues; however, some critics found the show's introduction of these issues to be forced and inauthentic.|$|E

5|$|The game's setting stemmed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> players {{being able}} to create and control a group of obedient creatures. The Shapers {{and the world of}} Geneforge were the result of Vogel imagining how would a being possess such power and how would they use it. The game's setting, a mixture of science fiction and fantasy, differs from the pure science fiction setting the game had been envisioned as. Vogel had {{difficulties}} balancing gameplay with the powerful directed-energy weapons players would expect to use in a science fiction game. Sales exceeded the developer's expectations, despite fears that the departure from Spiderweb's Avernum series would deter players. Geneforge received a positive reception from reviewers, despite the quality of the graphics being rated as poor and the game containing one piece of music, the title theme. The plot and setting were praised by reviewers for uniqueness and detail.|$|E

25|$|Lesbians often attract media attention, {{particularly}} {{in relation to}} feminism, love and sexual relationships, marriage and parenting. Some writers who have asserted this trend can lead to exploitative and unjustified plot devices. The lack of lesbian portrayal in the media can also influence the consumer's view of the particular sexuality. Common tropes of lesbians in the media include butch or femme lesbians and lesbian parents. The word Butch lesbian comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a lesbian expressing themselves as masculine by dressing masculine, behaving masculinely, or liking things that are deemed masculine, while the word femme lesbian comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a lesbian expressing themselves as feminine by dressing feminine, behaving femininely, or liking things that are deemed feminine. In the media, lesbian marriage and parenting are depicted in shows such as the live action television show The Fosters and even the children's cartoon Steven Universe.|$|E

Eutychianism is a specific understanding of how the human and divine relate within the person of Jesus Christ (that is, Eutychianism is a Christology).|$|R
25|$|Rousseau portrays Geneva in a {{very romantic}} and {{positive}} light, where people are productive, happy and hard at work, but he also recognizes the extreme wealth and poverty in the city. He first tries to sway Geneva away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> theatre by suggesting {{that it is not}} economically feasible, and that the population is too low to support a theatre.|$|E

It was dedicated to her father, creating the bird house as a tiny home for my dad and Emin thought of the works' title <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> nature and nurture.|$|E
25|$|The {{uprising}} {{was also}} exploited as the pretext for disrupting Tiflis University, which {{was seen by}} the Bolsheviks as a shelter of Georgian nationalism. Despite the fact that several leading academics, who sympathized with or even participated in the anti-Soviet movement, eventually distanced themselves <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an armed revolt and even denounced it in a special statement, the university was purged of unreliable elements and placed under the complete control of the Communist Party. Substantial changes were made in its structure, curriculum, and personnel, including the dismissal of the Rector, a noted historian Ivane Javakhishvili.|$|E

25|$|The Cuban Missile Crisis in the Autumn of 1962, {{in which}} the United States {{blockaded}} a Soviet attempt to put nuclear missiles on Cuba, created widespread public anxiety about imminent nuclear war and CND organised demonstrations on the issue. But {{six months after the}} crisis, a Gallup Poll found that public concern about nuclear weapons had fallen to its lowest point since 1957, and there was a view (disputed by some CND supporters) that U.S. President John F. Kennedy's success in facing down Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev turned the British public away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> unilateral nuclear disarmament.|$|E
25|$|Club Olimpia is a Paraguayan sports club {{based in}} the city of Asunción. The club {{promotes}} the practice of various sports with most importance given to the football and basketball sides, the former being the highest priority and most successful. They were founded on July 25, 1902 by a group of young Paraguayans, and the name stems <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> its principal founding member, William Paats, a Dutchman based in Paraguay, who is considered the father of Paraguayan football for having introduced the practice of the sport in the South America country. Internationally, the club is referred to as Olimpia Asunción in order to distinguish itself from Latin American football clubs of the same name.|$|E
25|$|The 1994 Kangaroo tour saw the {{introduction}} of a special 'tour games only' jersey, leaving the traditional kit for test matches. The jersey was essentially the same though gold hoops of increasing thickness were added to the jumper below the traditional gold chevrons. The 1994 tour was the only time this jersey was used. This had followed on <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> using a different jersey for non-test games on a tour that was started in 1992 when Australia was in England for the World Cup Final. The Kangaroos played three warm up games against Huddersfield, Sheffield and Cumbria wearing a predominantly white jersey with large green and gold diamonds in the shape of kit supplier Umbro.|$|E

500|$|The fancy rat is a domesticated rat (Rattus norvegicus), {{which is}} the most common breed among pet rats.

500|$|On {{the eve of}} war, {{there was}} serious {{domestic}} unrest in the UK (amongst the labour and suffrage movements and especially in Ireland) {{but much of the}} population rapidly rallied behind the government. Significant sacrifices were made in the name of defeating the Empire's enemies and many of those who could not fight contributed to philanthropic and humanitarian causes. Fearing food shortages and labour shortfalls, the government passed legislation such as the Defence of the Realm Act 1914, to give it new powers. The war saw a move away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> [...] "business as usual" [...] under prime minister H. H. Asquith, and towards a state of total war (complete state intervention in public affairs) under David Lloyd George, the first time this had been seen in Britain. The war also witnessed the first aerial bombardments of cities in Britain.|$|E
500|$|The {{philosophy}} of mind also has important {{consequences for the}} concept of self. If by [...] "self" [...] or [...] "I" [...] one refers to an essential, immutable nucleus of the person, some modern philosophers of mind, such as Daniel Dennett believe that no such thing exists. According to Dennett and other contemporaries, the self is considered an illusion. The idea of a self as an immutable essential nucleus derives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an immaterial soul. Such an idea is unacceptable to modern philosophers with physicalist orientations and their general skepticism {{of the concept of}} [...] "self" [...] as postulated by David Hume, who could never catch himself not doing, thinking or feeling anything. However, in the light of empirical results from developmental psychology, developmental biology and neuroscience, the idea of an essential inconstant, material nucleus—an integrated representational system distributed over changing patterns of synaptic connections—seems reasonable.|$|E

He wrote Elements of Morality, for the Use of Children, one of the first books translated into English by Mary Wollstonecraft.|$|R

50|$|The {{hypothesis}} of heat death stems <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, {{who in the}} 1850s took the theory of heat as mechanical energy loss in nature (as embodied {{in the first two}} laws of thermodynamics) and extrapolated it to larger processes on a universal scale.|$|R
500|$|The act was {{something}} that affected Kiedis significantly because he had never before experienced such an enlightening ideology on life. Growing up in Los Angeles, he had always thought differently from Hagen. Instead of giving material possessions away and being free thinking, the vocalist believed one must take what one wants, as {{no one else will}} provide. Instead, he now adopted Hagen's philosophy: [...] "It was such an epiphany that someone would want to give me her favorite thing. That stuck with me forever. Every time I'd be thinking 'I have to keep,' I'd remember 'No, you gotta give away instead.' When I started going regularly to [...] meetings, one of the principles I had learned was that the way to maintain your own sobriety is to give it to another suffering alcoholic. Every time you empty your vessel of that energy, fresh new energy comes flooding in." [...] Flea's bassline for the song allowed Kiedis to recall this incident and he believed the music paired perfectly with the lyrics. During the verses, Kiedis departs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> unselfishness and sings about a variety of topics including long-time friend River Phoenix, musician Bob Marley and various sexual themes including fertility and lust.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} Gus {{installing}} a surveillance camera into the meth lab stemmed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Walter and Gus employing what Gilligan called [...] "brinkmanship and gamesmanship" [...] {{against each other}} after their falling {{out at the end}} of the third season. Gilligan commented: [...] "What's one way Gus can amp up the story there? How can he mess with Walt's head a little bit?" [...] The footage shown from the first-person perspective of the camera is actual footage from the real camera, including the numbers shown at the top and bottom of the screen. This is why that shot is shown in pillarbox and in lower quality than the rest of the episode, which was shot in 35 mm film. The episode features a subplot with Marie engaging in acts of kleptomania, which had been a major part of her character during the first season. Catlin said it was conceived early on that Marie would act this way while brainstorming the ideas for Marie coping with Hank's difficult recovery. Gilligan described Marie's acts of stealing as a respite for her: [...] "She's looking for another life, but she's not actively ready to leave her husband or anything like that. ... We liked the quirkiness of it." [...] Betsy Brandt said [...] "Open House" [...] was her favorite episode of the season to shoot.|$|E
500|$|While {{working on}} Covert Operations, Klepacki {{composed}} Hell March <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> [...] "a rock tune to marching boots," [...] finishing {{the song in}} one day after inventing the guitar riff. Upon listening, director Brett Sperry insisted this song {{be used as the}} signature theme of Command & Conquer: Red Alert. Originally intended for use with the Brotherhood of Nod, it features militaristic samples—including marching, industrial sounds, and a commander shouting orders. Klepacki initially scored Red Alert with sci-fi camp in mind, but early songs were shelved. He switched gears to write gritty pieces, prompting the Red Alert team to expand upon the style of Command & Conquer. In preparing to compose, Klepacki acquired new sample libraries for unique and strange sounds. Particular creative moods would result in a few songs at a time. He first wrote heavy songs like Workmen and Crush, then composed neutral, synthesizer-laden music, such as Vector and Roll Out. Klepacki scored Fogger and Mud, one of his personal favorites, before finishing with Militant Force and Radio 2. He took breaks from working to make cameo appearances as a Soviet soldier killed by Kane and an Allied commander in the cut scenes of Red Alert. He previously appeared as a Nod soldier and the voice of the commando in Command & Conquer and would voice bit parts in future Westwood games.|$|E
5000|$|In 1992, the MRO {{decided to}} leave the MPP (and soon afterwards, the Broad Front) due to {{political}} differences with the direction the MPP was taking, stating that [...] "it was growing apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> Raúl Sendic regarding the foreign debt, the nationalization of banks and external trade".|$|R
