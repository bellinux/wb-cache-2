50|$|The Slovenian Museum of Natural History (Prirodoslovni muzej Slovenije, Museum Historiae Naturalis Sloveniae) is a Slovenian {{national}} museum with natural history, scientific, and <b>educational</b> <b>contents.</b> It {{is the oldest}} cultural and scientific Slovenian institution.|$|E
5000|$|Small {{distance}} {{suggests that}} the narrative and <b>educational</b> <b>content</b> are related {{to one another and}} that the <b>educational</b> <b>content</b> is causally embedded into the plot.|$|R
50|$|This {{principle}} {{suggests that}} priority {{is given to}} comprehension of the narrative <b>content</b> over the <b>educational</b> <b>content</b> assuming all things are equal. This primarily occurs when {{the distance between the}} <b>educational</b> <b>content</b> and narrative content is large. Working memory will be devoted to narrative before <b>educational</b> <b>content.</b> This is largely {{due to the fact that}} people typically select television content for its entertainment value before its educational value. Secondly, narrative content is featured as the primary or “surface” <b>contents,</b> whereas <b>educational</b> <b>content</b> is secondary or “deep” content.|$|R
5000|$|Understanding {{the effect}} {{distance}} has on processing will explain how certain content competes for attention. Large distances {{will require more}} resources due {{to the increase in}} competition, however resources are limited. The process used to encode, store, and retrieve narrative content is the same as <b>educational</b> <b>content.</b> When the narrative and <b>educational</b> <b>content</b> are intertwined, then it {{is said to be a}} small distance, thus reducing the amount of competition for limited resources. The parallel process responsible for comprehending narrative and <b>educational</b> <b>content</b> complement one another, thus increasing information retention.- This model predicts that <b>educational</b> <b>content</b> will be better attended to when the distance from the narrative is small and has been shown in previous studies ...|$|R

The model focuses on children’s allocation of their limited cognitive resources, with {{attention to the}} resources used for comprehending the narrative versus the <b>educational</b> <b>content</b> within the show. The model predicts that, when narrative processing demands are reduced, narrative comprehension will be improved. Reduced narrative demands are also expected to support <b>educational</b> <b>content</b> comprehension as greater cognitive resources are available to process the content. This prediction was tested with 172 American children (102 females, M = 4. 2 years). Narrative processing demands were operationalized via story schema. Results from a correlational analysis supported predictions. Advanced story schema was associated with improved narrative and <b>educational</b> <b>content</b> comprehension.

One of the problems considered in e-learning is the lack of <b>educational</b> <b>contents</b> adaptation for all learners. It means that <b>educational</b> <b>contents</b> are available for all learners equally. So, one way to solve this problem is modeling the learners before recommending <b>educational</b> <b>contents.</b> In fact, learner model is the knowledge about learner that his/her behavior can be predicated by an intelligent system based on his/her knowledge, which offers to user's appropriate <b>educational</b> <b>contents.</b> In this paper, new architecture is suggested for using anthologies contents for modeling users.
