500|$|His pleas were in vain. [...] Three days later, Digby, Robert Wintour, John Grant and Thomas Bates were hanged, {{drawn and}} {{quartered}} {{at the western}} end of St Paul's churchyard. [...] The following day, Rookwood, Thomas Wintour, Robert Keyes and Guy Fawkes were tied to wattled hurdles and dragged by horse from the Tower, to the Old Palace Yard at Westminsterâ€”a longer route than had been suffered by their fellow conspirators. [...] Rookwood had asked to be informed when he passed by his lodgings in the Strand, so that he could open his eyes and see his wife, waiting at the window. [...] He shouted [...] "Pray for me, pray for me!" [...] According to Father Gerard (who was not then present), Elizabeth answered, [...] "I will, and be of good courage. [...] Offer theyself wholly to God. [...] I, for my part, do as freely restore thee to God as He gave thee unto me." [...] For the rest of the journey <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> closed, in prayer. [...] Thomas Wintour was the first that day to be hanged and then killed. [...] Rookwood was next, and made a short speech to the assembled audience. [...] He was repentant, asking God to bless the king, queen, and their [...] "royal progeny", but [...] "spoil all the pottage with one filthy weed" [...] by beseeching God to make the king a Catholic. [...] Nevertheless, he seems to have been left to hang for longer than the others, before suffering the remainder of his grim sentence.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh! Baas, everything," [...] he answered, and I {{noticed that}} <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed upon {{the ground and}} that his lips twitched.|$|E
60|$|She cast {{about in}} her {{thoughts}} again, and <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> upon her as before.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> on the visi-plate. They were {{descending}} too quickly. There was no {{room for}} doubt. Much too quickly.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> on {{the tall}} boy, {{and as soon}} as Ferris was a short {{distance}} ahead Hal left the door-way and followed him.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> on her till he {{had made}} sure--and this deep {{exchange}} between them had a beauty. [...] "So you're now with me?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{knew that}} these snakes often travel in pairs, {{and as he}} went on his way <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> wide open for another attack.|$|E
60|$|Young Jolyon {{was a good}} listener; it was {{his great}} quality. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed on his father's face, putting a {{question}} now and then.|$|E
60|$|As he {{said this}} <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> upon <b>his</b> map, {{following}} his finger, as he moved it about from place to place, {{as if he was}} studying out a good way to go.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> eagerly upon Triscoe, as if {{to follow}} his thought while he read, and keep {{him up to the}} work, and he ignored the Marches so entirely that they began in {{self-defence}} to talk with each other.|$|R
60|$|Thereon he scooted with a subdued grin {{round the}} other side of the bush, whence as I knew well <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> fixed on me to be sure that I made no further attempt to take off the Great Medicine.|$|R
60|$|The words choked Philip, {{but he was}} {{determined}} not to shirk the truth. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> on Lawson and saw his embarrassment. Philip smiled savagely.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well then?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{with his}} head thrown back, on the warm bindings, admirable for old gilt and old colour, that covered the {{opposite}} wall.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> on the alert, {{but none}} of the signs for which he was searching appeared, nor did {{anything}} that looked like a mine entrance show itself.|$|E
60|$|Dirck did not answer, {{until we}} had trotted twenty rods; for {{by this time the}} pipe was at work, and the moment that smoke was seen <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> on it, until he saw a bright light in front of his nose.|$|R
60|$|Luncheon at 94 Grosvenor Square, {{notwithstanding}} the cocktails, was an exceedingly simple meal, a fact which the Marquis himself seemed scarcely to notice. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> on <b>his</b> visitor's plate, however, {{and passed the}} cutlets with an unnoticeable sigh of regret.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do, father. Jeff {{would make}} a good landlord; he's got ideas about a hotel, and I can see that they're the right ones. He's been out in the world, and <b>he's</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> open. <b>He</b> will make Lion's Head the best hotel in the mountains." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} them {{for a moment and}} flushed. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> upon them, as though {{actually}} to force his listeners into believing what he was about to say.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{fixed on}} hers, {{but he could}} not see them change from their pity of him, or light up with a sense of any squalor in his history.|$|E
6000|$|Horne Fisher did {{not seem}} entirely {{satisfied}} with this very sudden repentance; <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> on the man and only said, in a low voice, [...] "What crime do you mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Duval {{saw that}} the object of all this bluster was to see whether he could be intimidated. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> therefore, fixed {{steadily}} on the chief, and the moment he concluded with his menace, seized him by the bosom of his hunting shirt, and clinching his other fist: ...|$|R
60|$|Dr. Bauerstein, I noticed, was {{watching}} the local doctor narrowly. <b>He</b> still <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed on him as he spoke.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{the boat}} was in the stream, Pathfinder sank on his knees, {{continuing}} to use the paddle, though it was slowly, and in a manner not {{to interfere with the}} efforts of his companion. The latter still stood erect; and, as <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> on some object beyond the fall, it was evident that he was carefully looking for the spot proper for their passage.|$|R
60|$|Well, my own curiosity helped me. I cut the cord, {{threw open}} the lid, and looked in. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> turned away, {{as if he were}} frightened to look for himself.|$|E
60|$|The skipper {{nodded and}} slackened out the sheet {{a bit as}} the wind came more astern. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed ahead of him, and the men kept gazing through the gloom.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and ears}} {{open in a}} vain {{endeavor}} to learn something to his advantage. The ticket thieves had taken warning, and not the slightest clew to them could be unearthed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rising of the sun!" [...] slowly {{repeated}} the old man, lifting his tall person from its seat with a deliberate and abstracted air, while <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> riveted on the changing, and certainly beautiful tints, that were garnishing the vault of Heaven. [...] "Rising of the sun! I like not such risings of the sun. Ah's me! the imps have circumvented {{us with a}} vengeance. The prairie is on fire!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In Two Mighty Tribes Australian rugby {{commentator}} Gordon Bray wrote that, [...] "...to <b>his</b> great credit, <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> {{firmly on}} the ball and eventually scored the Bledisloe Cup-clinching try in the third test at Eden Park. It was a measure of his self-belief and pride, and it demonstrated to the broader rugby community that his was not just another frail talent. There was strength of character to stiffen the extravagant skills." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> on {{the provost}} as he uttered the name, {{which he did}} rather at a venture, and from the {{connexion}} which that gentleman, and his real or supposed niece, seemed to have with the fate of Darsie Latimer, than from any distinct cause of suspicion which he entertained. He thought the provost seemed embarrassed, though he showed much desire to assume an appearance of indifference, in which he partly succeeded.|$|R
60|$|The boys {{dispersed}} and {{mingled with}} the arriving guests. Dave did all he could to make everybody feel at home, but all the while {{he was doing it}} <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> wide open.|$|E
60|$|William gave a queer snort of exasperation, {{and opened}} his {{manuscript}} once more, though <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> upon her face as he did so. No face could have been graver or more judicial.|$|E
6000|$|She looked down, and <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{fixed on}} her rather sternly, {{for he had}} never before made a clandestine appointment, {{and he did not}} like feeling ashamed of it. At last she said,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Like {{all young}} persons born far from war, and having no {{knowledge}} of death even in its quiet forms, he had the most powerful organic repugnance toward a corpse. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> on it {{as though it were}} a sleeping horror, likely at a sudden sound to rise and walk. More than this, there had always been something peculiarly sacred in the form of a woman, and in his calmer moments the dead mother appealed to him with irresistible power.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I guess you're right," [...] Mrs. Durgin acquiesced, {{as much to}} Jeff's {{advantage}} as she could. [...] "You know I {{was always}} afraid {{he would make a}} fool of himself, but I guess <b>he's</b> <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> pretty well open all the while. Well!" [...] She closed the subject with this exclamation. [...] "Him and Cynthy's been at me about Jackson," [...] she added, abruptly. [...] "They've cooked it up between 'em that he's out of health or run down or something." ...|$|R
