40|$|As mergers become {{increasingly}} important in the financial services industry, the need for proper sensitivity analysis to assess the financial impact of the merger is essential. Unlike industrial mergers, there is almost always <b>initial</b> <b>dilution</b> in a bank merger. This {{is because of the}} homogenous nature of bank P/E ratios and the high premium over book value that is typically paid. The problem of dilution was further compounded by an SEC ruling in March of 1996 that restricted the repurchase of outstanding shares for two years after merger under a pooling of interests financial recording. Given these factors, the <b>initial</b> <b>dilution</b> can only be overcome by more rapid postmerger earnings growth by the holding company.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of wastewater discharged into coastal waters can be simplified as a turbulent jet under {{the effect of}} waves and currents. Previous studies {{have been carried out}} to investigate the jet behaviors under the current only or the wave only environment. To obtain better understanding of the jet behaviors in a realistic situation, a series of physical experiments on the <b>initial</b> <b>dilution</b> of a vertical round jet in the wavy cross-flow environment are conducted. The diluted processes of the jet are recorded by a high-resolution camcorder and the concentration fields of the jet are measured with a peristaltic suction pumping system. When the jet is discharged into the wavy cross-flow environment, a distinctive phenomenon, namely “effluent clouds”, is observed. According to the quantitative measurements, the jet width in the wavy cross-flow environment increases more significantly than that does in the cross-flow only environment, indicating that the waves impose a positive effect on the enhancement of jet <b>initial</b> <b>dilution.</b> In order to generalize the experimental findings, a comprehensive velocity scale ua and a characteristic length scale l are introduced. Through dimensional analysis, it is found that the dimensionless centerline concentration trajectories yc/l is in proportion to 1 / 3 power of the dimensionless downstream distance x/l, and the dimensionless centerline dilution ScQ/(ual 2) is proportional to the square of the dimensionless centerline trajectory yc/l. Several empirical equations are then derived by using the Froude number of cross-flow Frc as a reference coefficient.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} experimental {{investigation for}} an inclined (to vertical) dense jet in perpendicular crossflow-with a three-dimensional trajectory-is reported. The detailed tracer concentration {{field in the}} vertical cross-section of the bent-over jet {{is measured by the}} laser-induced fluorescence technique {{for a wide range of}} jet densimetric Froude number and ambient to jet velocity ratios. The jet trajectory and dilution determined from a large number of cross-sectional scalar fields are interpreted by the Lagrangian model over the entire range of jet-dominated to crossflow-dominated regimes. The mixing during the ascent phase of the dense jet resembles that of an advected jet or line puff and changes to a negatively buoyant thermal on descent. It is found that the mixing behavior is governed by a crossflow Froude number. For, the mixing is jet-dominated and governed by shear entrainment; significant detrainment occurs and the maximum height of rise is under-predicted as in the case of a dense jet in stagnant fluid. While the jet trajectory in the horizontal momentum plane is well-predicted, the measurements indicate a greater rise and slower descent. For the dense jet becomes significantly bent-over during its ascent phase; the jet mixing is dominated by vortex entrainment. For, the detrainment ceases to have any effect on the jet behavior. The jet trajectory in both the horizontal momentum and buoyancy planes are well predicted by the model. Despite the under-prediction of terminal rise, the jet dilution at a large number of cross-sections covering the ascent and descent of the dense jet are well-predicted. Both the terminal rise and the <b>initial</b> <b>dilution</b> for the inclined jet in perpendicular crossflow are smaller than those of a corresponding vertical jet.

Sediment type greatly affects the staining efficiency of DAPI, and most published studies seem to have underestimated bacterial abundances by using suboptimal concentrations of the fluorochrome. A DAPI concentration of 5 μg ml− 1 is required to effectively stain the bacteria in most sediments that can be sampled with a gravity corer. When the sediments are diluted 687 times (a dilution factor similar to those most often used in the literature), sediment particle masking of stained bacteria is highly variable for different sediment types. By using a measure of turbidity (A 750) to indicate masking and the quartz-corrected water content as a measure of the <b>initial</b> (in situ) <b>dilution</b> of each sediment type, it becomes possible to show a linear relationship between masking and the integrated (<b>initial</b> × experimental) <b>dilution</b> of various sediments. This relationship allows the development of a correction procedure for masking which makes accurate and unbiased counts possible. Data so obtained show a strong relationship between bacteria (cells per milliliter of fresh sediment) and sediment organic matter (grams [dry weight] per milliliter of fresh sediment), one that is not discernable without the correction.

No sugar decomposition occurred during either of the evaporations, while more than 96 % of furfural {{and to a lesser}} extent formic and acetic acids disappeared from the hydrolyzates. However, HMF and levulinic acid remained in the hydrolyzates and were concentrated proportionally. The concentrated hydrolyzates were then fermented in a 4 l bioreactor with 12 - 22 g/l yeast and 0. 14 - 0. 22 h- 1 initial dilute rates (ID). More than 84 % of the fermentable sugars present in the VEH were fermented by fed-batch cultivation using 12 g/l yeast and <b>initial</b> <b>dilution</b> rate (ID) of 0. 22 h- 1, and resulted in 0. 40 ± 0. 01 g/g ethanol from the fermentable sugars in one cycle of fermentation. Fermentation of HPEH was as successful as VEH and resulted in more than 86 % of the sugar consumption under the corresponding conditions. By lowering the <b>initial</b> <b>dilution</b> rate to 0. 14 h- 1, more than 97 % of the total fermentable sugars were consumed, and ethanol yield was 0. 44 ± 0. 01 g/g in one cycle of fermentation. The yeast was able to convert or assimilate HMF, levulinic, acetic, and formic acids by 96, 30, 43, and 74 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Fresh, empty, {{isolated}} sacs of leg {{skin from}} R. pipiens manufacture a salt solution reasonably balanced {{with respect to}} ions and approximating a somewhat dilute Ringer's fluid. Concentrations of ions bear little relationship to concentrations in the external medium even down to 12 mM. An effective regulatory mechanism is indicated whereby the amount of salt transported is adjusted {{to the amount of}} water or vice versa, the rate of movement of either salt or water being largely independent of osmotic or ionic gradients (outer fluid to manufactured inner fluid). Concentrations of the inner fluids appear to be regulated to conform to a fairly constant concentration within the skin. Some evidence is presented that a major factor in regulating concentration of the inner fluid is triggered by an <b>initial</b> <b>dilution</b> of the inner fluid, followed by stimulation of salt uptake...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{minocycline}} hydrochloride (Minocin) on bovine spermatozoa was studied in eggyolk-citrate, Tris buffer and whole milk extenders. Each of the extenders contained penicillin, streptomycin, lincomycin-spectinomycin and four levels of minocin (10, 260, 510 and 760 μg/ml). Split ejaculates from Holstein sires were diluted {{in each of}} the extenders. This was followed by microscopic evaluation for progressive motility after <b>initial</b> <b>dilution</b> at 32 °C, after cooling at 5 °C and complete dilution, immediately after freezing and after 14 days of storage in liquid nitrogen. Under the experimental conditions employed, a decrease in the percent progressive motility was observed in the eggyolk-citrate and Tris buffer extenders with increasing concentration of minocin. Little or no difference in the percent progressive motility in the whole milk extender, either before or after freezing was observed when the minocin concentration was elevated...|$|E
40|$|The data of {{the present}} study were {{collected}} from Bangladesh Milk Producers` Co-operative Union Limited (BMPCUL) at Baghabarighat, Sirajgong, Bangladesh to evaluate the bull performance through semen quality and 30 -day Non Return Rate (NRR). Data on 245 ejaculates and 12, 750 services of almost same aged of 5 Sahiwal bulls (B 1, B 2, B 3, B 4 and B 5) over a period of 5 years were collected from Animal Breeding Section and Cattle Feed Unit of BMPCUL. The significant (p 0. 05) variation was not found for pH. The highest volume of semen per ejaculate, the <b>initial,</b> on <b>dilution</b> and post-thawing sperm motility were found in bull B 4 and representing 5. 60 � 0. 19 mL, 73. 56 � 0. 61, 69. 27 � 0. 33 and 63. 90 � 0. 48 %, respectively. The highest sperm motility was found in initial stage and then declined steadily up to post-thawing stage. Significant (p< 0. 01) positive correlations were observed between the three stages of sperm motility and fertility. The results {{of the present study}} revealed that evaluation of breeding bulls on the basis of semen quality and herd fertility is important and provides the guideline of the way to sire selection for reproductive performance...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{hydrodynamic instability}} of a steady planar detonation wave propa-gating {{in a circular}} tube to three-dimensional linear perturbations, using the normal mode approach. Spinning instability is identied and its relevance to the well-known spin detonation is discussed. The neutral stability curves in the plane of heat release and activation energy exhibit bifurcations from low-frequency to high-frequency spin-ning modes as the heat release is increased at xed activation energy. With a simple Arrhenius model for the heat release rate, a remarkable qualitative agreement with experiment is obtained {{with respect to the}} eects of <b>dilution,</b> <b>initial</b> pressure and tube diameter on the behaviour of spin detonation. The analysis contributes to the explanation of spin detonation which has essentially been absent since the discovery of the phenomenon over seventy years ago. 1...|$|R
40|$|An {{antibody}} reacting with Schwann sheaths of myelinated somatic and unmyelinated autonomic {{peripheral nerve}} {{was found in}} sixty-one out of seventy-one chronic, and {{nine out of ten}} acute, Chagas' disease sera. Indirect immunofluorescence (IFL) was carried out on rat, mouse and human somatic nerves and rat sympathetic nerves with <b>initial</b> serum <b>dilutions</b> of 1 : 10, and the staining reached a final titre of 1 : 320 in some cases. The antibodies fixed complement and were absorbed out by lyophilized epimastigotes of T. cruzi. Lipid extraction of the tissue sections enhanced the staining of myelinated nerve, whereas unfixed unmyelinated sympathetic nerve was strongly reactive. Central nervous tissue did not display any positive staining on neurons, glial cells or periaxonal sheaths. Furthermore, by using a double-labelled IFL technique, it was possible to show that a rabbit antiserum raised against guinea-pig spinal cord and the chagasic anti-nerve antibodies reacted with different structures in the rat sciatic nerve. These findings suggest that the reactive antigen(s) could be located on Schwann cells. The majority, but not all, of the chagasic individuals with anti-nerve antibodies also showed the sarcolemmal and endothelial staining (EVI) previously described in Chagas' disease. The possible recognition of Schwann cell antigens by circulating antibodies in Chagas' disease could be relevant, since an autonomic denervation has been postulated as a pathogenic mechanism of cardiomyopathy and megaviscera in this condition...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} novel integrated remote sensing and hydrodynamic simulation methods for cost effective design, evaluation, inspection, maintenance, and repair of wastewater disposal infrastructure. Wastewater diffusers {{are needed to}} meet minimum dilution requirements within a regulatory mixing zone, a limited region around the discharge structure where the <b>initial</b> <b>dilution</b> occurs. We have created new methods for the CORMIX software system to provide comprehensive analysis of point source mixing zones. The CorHyd internal diffuser hydraulics simulation tool is introduced for design and analysis of multiport discharges. We {{have developed}} new methods to assess diffuser infrastructure physical condition using various remote sensing technologies. Our patent-pending aerial remote sensing platform monitors mixing zone water quality and provides assessment of outfall physical condition through diffuser performance monitoring.

40|$|Abstract This work {{represents}} one of the first successful applications of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for interdisciplinary coastal research. A monitoring mission to study the shape and estimate the <b>initial</b> <b>dilution</b> of the S. Jacinto sewage outfall plume using an AUV was performed on July 2002. An efficient sampling strategy enabling greater improvements in spatial and temporal range of detection demonstrated that the sewage effluent plume can be clearly traced using naturally occurring tracers in the wastewater. The outfall plume was found at the surface highly influenced by the weak stratification and low currents. Dilution varying with distance downstream was estimated from the plume rise over the outfall diffuser until a nearly constant value of 130 : 1, 60 m from the diffuser, indicating the near field end. Our results demonstrate that AUVs can provide high-quality measurements of physical properties of effluent plumes in a very effective manner and valuable considerations about the initial mixing processes under real oceanic conditions can be further investigated...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study on the}} hydrodynamic behaviours of a round buoyant jet under the effect of JONSWAP random waves. A three-dimensional large eddy simulation (LES) model is developed to simulate the buoyant jet in a stagnant ambient and JONSWAP random waves. By comparison of velocity and concentration fields, {{it is found that}} the buoyant jet exhibits faster decay of centerline velocity, wider lateral spreading and larger <b>initial</b> <b>dilution</b> under the wave effect, indicating that wave dynamics improves the jet entrainment and mixing in the near field, and subsequently mitigate the jet impacts in the far field. The effect of buoyancy force on the jet behaviours in the random waves is also numerically investigated. The results show that the wave effect on the jet entrainment and mixing is considerably weakened under the existence of buoyancy force, resulting in a slower decay rate of centerline velocity and a narrower jet width for the jet with initial buoyancy.

40|$|Quantitative {{studies of}} {{cytokine}} gene expression in vivo are {{necessary in order}} to properly describe the cytokine network and to elucidate its role in skin inflammation. Ideally, one should be able to follow cytokine gene expression in epidermal, dermal, and blood compartments. However, such studies are limited by small amounts of available material. Here we report a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cDNA amplification protocol useful for quantification of specific mRNAs in small skin samples. We found that analysis of dilution series of each sample permitted establishment of quantitative PCR amplification conditions using only picogram to nanogram amounts of total RNA. Cytokine mRNA amounts could then be measured relative to an internal standard species, co-reverse transcribed, and co-amplified with the cytokine species as a measure of cDNA input. Large numbers of samples can be screened rapidly with <b>initial</b> short <b>dilution</b> series identifying cytokine-positive samples and the correct dilution range for each, followed by closer analysis in this range. Epidermal samples obtained through curettage of a small skin area, 2 -mm dermal biopsies from the scraped sites, and a few blood drops from the biopsy sites all yielded sufficient RNA for analysis by this protocol. Any mRNA of known sequence can be studied. We analyzed interleukin 8 mRNA levels in more than a hundred epidermal samples from patients and normal test persons and found a variation over several orders of magnitude that seemed to follow the degree of inflammation of the skin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{the present}} work, the model {{reference}} nonlinear controller (MRNC) based on pseudo dynamic model {{is designed to}} a continuous bioreactor which exhibits input multiplicities in dilution rate on productivity. i. e., two values of dilution rate will give the same value of productivity. The performance of MRNC and linear PI controller have been evaluated through simulation studies. The optimal parameters of MRNC have been obtained based on integral square error criterion (ISE) through simulations. As the MRNC provides always the two values of Dilution rate for control action and by selecting value nearer to the operating point, it is found to give stable and better response than linear PI controller. Linear PI controller results in wash out condition or switch over from <b>initial</b> lower input <b>dilution</b> rate to higher input dilution rate or vice versa. Thus, PDMRNC is found to overcome the control problems of PI controller due to the input multiplicitie...|$|R
40|$|Low-field (0. 02 - 4 MHz) proton nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) longitudinal relaxometry was applied to ultrahighly diluted aqueous solutions in order to detect physical modifications induced in the solvent by the dilution process. A mixture of silica-lactose (1. 67 · 10 - 5 M silica, 2. 92 · 10 - 2 M lactose) was initially solubilized in water or in saline, then submitted to eighteen iterative centesimal dilutions in water or in saline under vigorous vortex agitation and rigorously controlled atmospheric conditions, and compared to similarly treated pure water and saline as controls. Several independent series of samples were measured according to a blind protocol (total of 140 code-labelled samples). A slight frequency dispersion (about 4 %) was found within the 0. 02 - 4 MHz range, centered around 0. 55 MHz, and ascribed to combined effects of silica and trace paramagnetic contaminants, both concentrated and in a reduced motion at the borosilicate wall tube interface. The iterative dilution-agitation process in pure water and saline induced no significant effect on relaxivity. Slightly increased relaxivity compared to solvent {{was found in the}} <b>initial</b> silica-lactose <b>dilution</b> (especially in saline, about 4 %), which vanished unexpectedly slowly upon dilution, as adjusted to an arbitrary log-linear model. Statistical analysis was applied to succeed in discriminating solutions from their solvents beyond the 10 - 12 level of dilution. No clear explanation emerged, but post-experiment chemical analysis revealed high amounts (6 ppm) of released silica from the glass material used, with excess in silica-lactose samples, and lower amounts of trace paramagnetic contaminants in highly diluted silica-lactose samples, which could provide a clue.
