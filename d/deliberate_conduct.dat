These are characteristics of that which we call our will. Schopenhauer affirmed that we can legitimately think that all other phenomena are also essentially and basically will.

It appears in every blindly acting force of nature, {{and also in the}} <b>deliberate</b> <b>conduct</b> of man&hellip;." [...] Schopenhauer said that his predecessors mistakenly thought that the will depends on knowledge.

The fraud triangle theory developed by Donald Cressey (1973) has been widely used by professionals as a useful theoretical model to explain why most fraud occurs. This study explores the extension of the fraud triangle theory, previously applied in the financial crimes area, to the academic field. No such model has been developed that specifically addresses academic fraud.

Academic fraud, for the purpose of this study, refers to an intentional or <b>deliberate</b> effort, <b>conduct,</b> or behavior by an individual or group to gain an unfair advantage in academic performance personally or on behalf of another person by deception, cheating, lying, stealing, plagiarism, or otherwise. The incidence of fraud, whether in corporations or academic institutions, has always been of interest as much to researchers as it is to practitioners and managers.

Assumptions about human potential and learning, which challenge language learners, are briefly discussed in terms of the application of the model of communication with those learning.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of the law of vicarious liability and its application within the legal framework of delict in South Africa. A brief overview of the historical development of this branch of law is given, with reference to the influences of Roman, Roman-Dutch and English law. That is followed by an exposition of the 'modem' interpretation of vicarious liability as applied in South African courts, highlighting apparent inconsistencies and the need for reform in what has become a persistently controversial area of law. Specific attention is paid to the so-called 'course and scope enquiry' and to the enduring difficulties associated with attributing liability to employers for the <b>deliberate</b> wrongful <b>conduct</b> of their employees. It is argued that the courts have yet to reach consensus on a general principle capable of being applied to the facts of so-called 'deviation cases', and that consequently the legal divergence on these matters gives rise to uncertainty and concern. It is submitted that {{the way in which the}} traditional test for vicarious liability is currently applied fails to give true effect to the policy considerations upon which this branch of law is founded. By way of comparison with the South African position, a detailed account of the law of vicarious liability in comparable foreign jurisdictions is given, with emphasis placed on recent developments in England and the British Commonwealth. The study then moves to {{an analysis of}} the various policy considerations behind vicarious liability, with particular attention being paid to the role of risk-related liability and the role of risk-assumption in the 'course and scope' enquiry. A comparative analysis follows, highlighting differences between the approaches of the foreign jurisdictions and that taken by the South African courts. The work concludes with a proposal that the South African courts should broaden the scope of vicarious liability and opt for a model similar to that which has recently been adopted in Canada...|$|R

The officers lost sight of the suspect and mistakenly assumed he entered an apartment from which they could detect the odor of marijuana. After police knocked on the door and identified themselves, they heard movements, which they believed indicated evidence was about to be destroyed. Police forcibly entered the apartment and found Hollis King and others smoking marijuana. They also found cash, drugs and paraphernalia. King entered a conditional guilty plea; reserving his right to appeal denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained from what he argued was an illegal search. The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, holding that exigent circumstances supporting the warrantless search were not of the police's making and that police did not engage in <b>deliberate</b> and intentional <b>conduct</b> to evade the warrant requirement. In January 2010, the Kentucky Supreme Court reversed the lower court order, finding that the entry was improper.

As for sleepwalking itself, the Canadian case of R v Parks (1992) 75 CCC (3d) 287 exemplifies a certain judicial willingness to regard a sleepwalker as behaving as an automaton even though he had performed apparently goal-directed acts. The accused fell asleep in his living room. A few hours later he got up and drove 23 kilometres to his in-laws' home. Still asleep, he entered the house, found a knife in the kitchen and went to the bedroom where his in-laws were sleeping. He strangled and cut his father in-law, who survived the attack. The mother in-law died from the repeated stab wounds and the brutal beating. The medical experts at trial unanimously agreed that the accused was sleepwalking and that sleepwalking was not a 'disease of mind'. The Supreme Court agreed and held that sleepwalking can negate the voluntary ingredient of the actus reus. There is widespread disagreement among forensic sleep experts that Kenneth Parks was in fact sleepwalking - it is not entirely clear the reason why the prosecution did not call its own experts on sleepwalking, one explanation being frank disbelief that the defence could succeed.|$|R

This analysis includes development of a light infantry attack simulation which employed object oriented programming in MODSIM II. The simulation models light infantry operations in the NTC environment and is used to explore alternative tactical employment techniques designed to enhance unit performance on the AirLand Battlefield. This thesis also describes the tank and mechanized infantry task force. The light infantry task force, the heavy/light rotation concept, the deliberate attack mission, and the NTC environment and data collection capabilities. The simulation models an infantry attack against opposing forces in fixed, fortified positions. The model is a high resolution simulation which builds object code from infantry platoon level through battalion. The simulation depicts unit movements, attrition to indirect fires, and target engagements. The positioning of enemy forces is extracted from actual battlefield positions during an NTC deliberate attack mission. The simulation replicates close operations in which the light force mission is to gain an initial penetration of enemy barriers and pass the heavy force forward to continue the attack. The simulation study explores the use of light forces in alternative tactical scenarios. [URL] United States Arm...|$|R

In reversing federal or state judgments, the Court often has located direct proof of wrongdoing by the prosecutor. The notorious “bloody shorts” case is an example in point. There, the state introduced as evidence a pair of men’s “blood-stained” undershorts to achieve conviction of the accused. When the blood turned out to be red paint, the Supreme Court granted habeas corpus relief to the defendant because “[ilt was further established that counsel for the prosecution had known {{at the time of the}} trial that the shorts were stained with paint [...] . The prosecution deliberately misrepresented the truth. ” Judicial opinions in this area of the law have frequently emphasized the prosecutor’s historic duty not to convict but rather to do justice. Violations of this duty by the state’s prosecuting officer can create constitutional problems of verdict-rupturing magnitude: “It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one. ” That <b>deliberate</b> evidence-suppressing <b>conduct</b> by the prosecutor voids a conviction is clear. But the problem becomes more difficult when the hiding of documents or witnesses is accomplished not by the prosecutor but by a lower-ranking minion of the state. What if a police officer discovers important evidence which is helpful to the defendant and fails to call it to the attention of either the prosecutor or the defense? Consider a 1967 United States Court of Appeals proclamation on the subject: So far as we have been able to ascertain, all the Supreme Court cases setting aside convictions for want of due process by reason of the reception of false testimony are based upon knowledge of the prosecutor that the testimony received is false or knowledge that material evidence has been suppressed. Such would appear to be a proper limitation of the rule. Absent knowledge by the prosecutor himself, a police officer 2 ̆ 7 s misconduct in suppressing relevant evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the conviction. Other courts have displayed a decided reticence to overturn convictions without proof of complicity by the prosecutor in the wrongdoing. Such proof is frequently hard to come by, leaving open major issues in these cases: Does the conduct of a police officer in suppressing evidence constitute state action which deprives a conviction of its due process base, assuming such suppression is eventually discovered? In the false evidence cases, can a defendant who was condemned by perjured testimony successfully attack his conviction even though he lacks proof of governmental connivance in the perjury? In dealing with these issues this article explores the question of whether the Due Process Clause is addressed to the prosecutor alone, or applies as well to police and others who may traffic in suppressed or false evidence...|$|R

Problems on fossil fuels energy are not only lack of resource but alsocreating the environmental problems. Oil based energy waste such as carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) block heat in atmosphere and accelerate earth surface temperatureto trigger global warming. From this point of view, we need a suitable energy substitute assoon as possible. Dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) using the principle of natural photosynthesis are nowcurrently at the verge of commercialization having similar photoconversion efficiency ascompared to amorphous silicon solar cells. DSSCs or well known as Gr?tzel cells, consist ofn-type semiconductor such as titanium dioxide (TiO 2), tungsten oxide (WO 3), zinc oxide(ZnO) or tin dioxide (SnO 2), with the light absorber. The structure is different from all solarcell mentioned above where light is being absorbed by the semiconductor materials itself. Relatively low cost and easy manufacturing process make DSSCs one of candidates forfuture solar energy resources. DSSCs reached up to 13 % of efficiency in recent days. Thereare several barriers in DSSCs commercialization, for instance, utilization of only visibleregion of solar spectra, high cost of transparent conductive Oxide (TCO) glass, and so on. Our final goals are to extend the photo sensitivity of DSSCs to far-red and NIR area, tochange the structure of DSSCs into back-contact DSSC in order to totally remove the TCOparts, and to fabricated cylindrical structure for harvesting more light in a day and decreasingwind resistance. Chapter 1 deals with our research motivation, kinds of renewable energy, review aboutphotovoltaics cell and propose of our present work.

Furthermore,modification of the side chain at α-position of the sensitizer was done to optimize theHOMO-LUMO level. In chapter 5, novel DSSC structure are discussed. Titanium sheet with micro holes (FTSMH) was utilized as photo-anode and as counter electrode to completely eliminate TCO fromDSSCs in flat {{as well as in}} cylinder structure. In flat back-contact DSSC, hydrogen peroxidetreatment was used to modifu the titanium surface to make TiO 2 nanosheets, which leads toenhancement of short circuit current and open circuit voltage. Reduction of electrolytic gapwas carried out to optimize IPCE in 300 - 400 nm wavelength region. In cylindrical structure,TCO-less cylinder DSSCs ware fabricated by folding the FTS-MH sheet and Ti-basedcounter electrode and inserted into heat shrinkable tubes. It was proved that the processenhanced the photovoltaic performance to the cylinder DSSC. In last chapter we discuss about results and further optimizations prospect from currentworks and hopefully help researcher and industry to accelerate commercialization of DSSCsin near future. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:生工博甲第 242 号 学位授与年月日:平成 27 年 9 月 25 日 1.
