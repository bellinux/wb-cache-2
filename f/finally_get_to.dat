Orci hinted that the {{audience}} was going to meet [...] "many Observers", {{and that in the}} season's eighth episode, [...] "You're going to find out their role in the world, what they're named after, and their connection to some of these characters." [...] Later on, when still leading up to the airing of [...] "August" [...] in another interview, Roberto Orci elaborated that [...] "Individuality {{will be one of the}} things that they will be fanatically struggling with, actually. That was a fun one, because that one was one where you're finally getting to pay off things you've been setting up for a year. You <b>finally</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> open the toy box and really play with those toys". Actor Michael Cerveris, who plays September, commented in an interview that as a result of the episode, viewers would learn that the Observers [...] "are not completely devoid of feelings, and are not incapable of being attached to people they're observing". He also expressed relief that his character was no longer the sole Observer on the show, joking that [...] "it was nice to feel like I'm not the only freak in town for once".|$|E
500|$|Chris Carabott from IGN was {{critical}} of both Shannon and her relationship with Boone before the plane crash, commenting [...] "Shannon's ability to 'sort-of' understand French and Boone's lifeguard training have had little impact and as characters they bring very little to the table. There are also too many more intriguing storylines and characters around them that deserve attention." [...] On their relationship he added, [...] "except for the final act, when they finally succumb to their lust for one another ... There's nothing exciting here or anything that will ultimately be built upon in the Lost universe." [...] In a later review, for the episode following Boone's death, he commented [...] " [...] were both left with {{very little to do}} this season. Especially Shannon, whose high point of usefulness was deciphering Rousseau's documents for Sayid. Well, Maggie Grace is given an opportunity to shine and she does an acceptable job as the distraught sibling who is now looking for someone to blame for Boone's death. We <b>finally</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> see some real depth to Shannon's character and her quest for vengeance is believable."

2500|$|Leno kept The Tonight Show {{number one}} {{for the rest of}} his run, until he handed the {{franchise}} to Fallon in February 2014. Fallon's credibility with younger viewers and presence online was why NBC instituted the change, which was announced only three years following O'Brien's departure. During the show that aired the day of the announcement, Conan congratulated Fallon, stating, [...] "Jimmy is the perfect guy to do it, and he's gonna do a fantastic job." [...] While alluding to (and joking about) the 2010 controversy many times over his last few weeks on the air, Leno did not directly acknowledge his nine-month absence from the franchise nor did he mention O'Brien when he delivered his thank-yous and goodbyes as he concluded his second tenure as host. During the February 6, 2014 episode of Conan, however, which aired the same night as Leno's final Tonight Show, O'Brien referenced Leno in his monologue by alluding to NBC's position as the American broadcaster of the 2014 Winter Olympics, saying:"NBC has the Olympics. It's a big deal. NBC will <b>finally</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> show somebody who is okay with passing the torch. (pause for laughter and applause) I allowed myself one, but it was a good one." ...|$|E

6000|$|The Southern {{papers in}} commenting upon Sherman's {{movements}} pictured him {{as in the}} most deplorable condition: stating that his men were starving, that they were demoralized and wandering about almost without object, aiming only to reach the sea coast and get {{under the protection of}} our navy. These papers got to the North and had more or less effect upon the minds of the people, causing much distress to all loyal persons particularly to those who had husbands, sons or brothers with Sherman. Mr. Lincoln seeing these accounts, had a letter written asking me if I could give him anything that he could say to the loyal people that would comfort them. I told him there was not the slightest occasion for alarm; that with 60,000 such men as Sherman had with him, such a commanding officer as he was could not be cut off in the open country. He might possibly be prevented from reaching the point he had started out to reach, but he would get through somewhere and would <b>finally</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> his chosen destination: and even if worst came to worst he could return North. I heard afterwards of Mr. Lincoln's saying, to those who would inquire of him as to what he thought about the safety of Sherman's army, that Sherman was all right: [...] "Grant says they are safe with such a general, and that if they cannot get out where they want to, they can crawl back by the hole they went in at." ...|$|E
