40|$|In {{this paper}} are {{analyzed}} the genocide, the {{crimes against humanity}} and war crimes {{from the perspective of}} humanitarian law, in order to highlight the relevant aspects regarding the non-applicability of statutory limitations to these crimes. To obtain some efficient legal instruments of protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, and preventing genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, United Nations has established in the international law the "principle of non-applicability of statutory limitations to war crimes and crimes against humanity". A brief analysis is made <b>on</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>acts</b> adopted at European level which regulate the institution of the imprescriptibility of the aforementioned crimes, such as The Convention on the Non-applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity, which was ratified by Romania by Decree no. 547 / 1969 (B. Of. No. 83 of 30 July 1969). The Convention contains references regarding the statute of limitations for criminal liability and enforcement of sentences. The analysis of the Convention is intended to highlight the importance of this European <b>legislative</b> <b>act,</b> since it was the first legal instrument of the international community, through which it was possible to ensure the protection of rights and fundamental freedoms beyond the sovereignty of states, thus representing a success and an innovation in international law...|$|R

In addition to the constitutional provisions which guaranteed the rights of the Jewish community and other communities, the paper focuses <b>on</b> the <b>legislative</b> <b>acts</b> which were productive for the Jewish community as well as on the ordinances and decrees which substantially restricted the rights of the Jews in these territories. In particular, there is a specific reference to the legislative provisions, regulations and orders instituted after the occupation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

40|$|Thank you Chairman Harkin {{and members}} of the {{committee}} for the invitation to be here today. My name is Gary W. Phillips, and I am a Vice President and Chief Scientist at the American Institutes for Research (AIR). AIR is a 65 -year-old, not-for-profit, nonpartisan organization whose mission is to conduct behavioral and social science research to improve people’s lives and well-being, with a special emphasis on the disadvantaged. Previously, I was the Acting Commissioner at the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). My career has been devoted to providing policymakers with better data to help them improve American education. Today I would like to make two central points about No Child Left Behind and the reauthorization of the ESEA. 1. I will demonstrate that No Child Left Behind (NCLB) has a large loop hole that has misled the public and I encourage Congress to close this loop hole in the reauthorization of the ESEA. Other people will be providing you testimony <b>on</b> whether this <b>legislative</b> <b>act</b> will improve education. I will focus <b>on</b> whether this <b>legislative</b> <b>act</b> provides enough information to know if education has been improved. 2. I will propose that Congress encourage states to abandon their outmoded 20 th century paper/pencil-based testing paradigm {{for a new generation of}} 21 st century technology-based tests that are more accurate, less burdensome, faster, and cheaper. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree to}} which European Union (EU) {{policy-making}} is representative of citizens’ preferences is a central contested issue {{in the debate over}} the EU’s ‘democratic deficit’. Previous studies have demonstrated that in many cases political representatives share their voters’ attitudes to the EU. However, this research has rarely considered the substance of actual legislative policy-making in the EU institutions. Scrutinising the popular image that EU policy-making is unresponsive to public demands, the thesis investigates EU-level representation along the ‘domestic route’, on which citizens’ preferences intrude policymaking through their national governments in the Council of the EU. Using a range of original and existing datasets, the four papers investigate three classic assessment criteria of representation (mandate fulfilment, responsiveness, congruence) with methods ranging from mixed effects regressions to quantitative text analysis. Three central findings emerge: first, national governments are responsive to their domestic public opinion when negotiating and voting <b>on</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>acts</b> in the EU. Regarding legislative conflicts over left-right issues, responsiveness is stronger with majoritarian than proportional electoral systems and peaks when national elections are imminent. When it comes to pro-anti integration conflicts, responsiveness is conditional on the salience of EU issues in national political arenas. Second, executive coordination and parliamentary oversight in EU affairs limit the discretion of national ministers in EU negotiations and help governments to deliver their electoral mandates. Third, final EU policy output is most responsive to and congruent with the views of those national publics that have clear-cut opinions on a policy issue and care intensely about it. These findings are evidence of surprising patterns of citizen representation in EU policy-making. They suggest that politicisation of the EU and the diffusion of executive coordination and parliamentary oversight in EU affairs could strengthen representation. Yet, evidence remains scarce that better representation will end the EU’s legitimacy crisis...|$|R
40|$|Europeanization {{has been}} at the core of two {{research}} projects on decision-making processes in Switzerland that we carried out over the last decade. Interestingly enough, Europeanization was initially not supposed to be the central focus of these projects: The first was broader in scope, as it dealt with the effects of globalization and internationalization, and the second was agnostic with respect to Europeanization – it looked at the characteristics of the most important decision-making processes and structures in contemporary Switzerland, and at the related changes that have taken place since the 1970 s. However, in both projects Europeanization has imposed itself as a crucial variable, if not as the most crucial variable. We use insights from these two research projects – and from a database <b>on</b> the <b>legislative</b> <b>acts</b> of the 1995 - 2006 period that emerged from these projects – to address the questions raised by the initiators of this debate and, more especially, to highlight what effects Europeanization has on decision-making processes and related power and conflict structures among actors...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the Trio Presidency {{and its impact}} on voting behavior in the Council of the European Union. Trios of Member States cooperate for eighteen-month periods, with each member holding the Presidency for six months. In particular we study whether belonging to the Trio increases the probability that a Member State vote in favor of a measure. In addition we examine whether holding the Presidency itself further raises that probability. Our study addresses these questions by quantitatively analyzing roll call votes of Member States <b>on</b> 823 <b>legislative</b> <b>acts</b> from January 2007 till December 2012. Conducting probit regression analyses we produce evidence that Member States are indeed more likely to vote in favor during their participation in Trios. Moreover, we find that holding the Presidency itself does not further increase the probability. Earlier work had concluded that, prior to the introduction of the Trios, holding the Presidency made it more likely that a Member State vote in favor. We show that, since the introduction of the Trios, belonging to the Trio rather than holding the Presidency affects voting behavior. status: publishe...|$|R

Due {{to the influence of}} the Napoleonic codes and the 19 th century Exegetic School, we might have a wrong view <b>on</b> the role <b>legislative</b> <b>acts</b> had formerly. The law's subjects didn't have to accept the black letter of the law from the first until its last word, and the text's success was more due to its printed distribution than to its legal validity. Law just interacted with other - even important - formal sources of the law, and is more to be considered a pragmatic programme than an authoritative text. Several examples are given, most of them related to the Edictum Perpetuum of the Archdukes of 1611...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} is what causes and symptoms must be present when the state is democratic and remains democratic {{in the field of}} <b>legislative</b> <b>act.</b> This is a discussion topic of this article with the title of state responsibility <b>on</b> the <b>legislative</b> power <b>acts.</b> If there is a loss of political rights to people from the <b>legislative</b> power <b>acts</b> or the legislator, who will be responsible for it? In this paper, this issue has been examined from the perspective of democratic standards. The legislator must observe democratic measures on the one hand to regulate the rules {{and on the other hand}} since he is selected by people and has the responsibility of determining their destiny should defend the rights of people especially their political rights. Thus, he cannot make the laws when the political rights of people are stated in the constitution especially when it violates the right of freedom and secondly if the laws that enter losses to the rights of people are needed, they should be compensated. Moreover, the exercise of the right of the people makes the representatives to not be offended in the performance of duty. The lack of offending the representatives is not the personal privilege, but is a manifestation of the people's sovereignty under Article 56 of the constitution. 1...|$|R

40|$|The thesis's {{main focus}} is {{discourse}} analysis (both textual {{and in the}} field of policy) of the securitization process in the Netherlands for the period 2004 - 2006, and the implications of it for multiculturalism. The emphasis on culture that multiculturalism entails is the issue at stake. In the Netherlands, especially immigrants are being addressed in relation with their national culture which creates separate communities centred on different ethnicities and cultures. I explore how cultural essentialism and cultural fundamentalism are perceived in regard to the national identity and culture of Dutch people. The assessment of the nature and extend of political discourse reveals to us whether securitization is among one of the causes of the new guises for cultural essentialism. The methodology of this thesis is embedded in a multidisciplinary theoretical framework pertaining to combination of critical discourse analysis (CD A) of Norman Fairclough (his three dimensional model for analysis of the relationship between discursive practice, linguistic analysis of text and social practices) and refined version of the Copenhagen school's securitization theory. Furthermore, the conceptual notion of multiculturalism and the problem of culture are central to this framework for the findings' analysis. The empirical data analyzed are composed by around 50 politicians' speeches, their opinion pieces and written statements on immigration. The social practice is analyzed <b>on</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>acts,</b> adopted policies, government's proposals and press releases of ministries. I claim that speech acts and policy practices are integral components for studying the securitization discourse. In line with Jef Huysmans, Didier Bigo, and Christina Boswell, I argue that securitization is not wholly dependent on the explicit naming of something in terms of security but also on positioning of an issue within a specific policy domain. Furthermore, I widen the assumptions concerning processes of infiltration of security professionals into previously immigration domains. Endast sammandrag.

5000|$|The term {{pork barrel}} {{politics}} usually refers to spending which {{is intended to}} benefit constituents of a politician {{in return for their}} political support, either in the form of campaign contributions or votes. In the popular 1863 story [...] "The Children of the Public", Edward Everett Hale used the term pork barrel as a homely metaphor for any form of public spending to the citizenry. However, after the American Civil War, the term came to be used in a derogatory sense. The Oxford English Dictionary dates the modern sense of the term from 1873. Pork barrel originally came from storing meat. By the 1870s, references to [...] "pork" [...] were common in Congress, and the term was further popularized by a 1919 article by Chester Collins Maxey in the National Municipal Review, which reported <b>on</b> certain <b>legislative</b> <b>acts</b> known to members of Congress as [...] "pork barrel bills". He claimed that the phrase originated in a pre-Civil War practice of giving slaves a barrel of salt pork as a reward and requiring them to compete among themselves to get their share of the handout.More generally, a barrel of salt pork was a common larder item in 19th century households, and {{could be used as a}} measure of the family's financial well-being. For example, in his 1845 novel The Chainbearer, James Fenimore Cooper wrote: [...] "I hold a family to be in a desperate way, when the mother can see the bottom of the pork barrel." ...|$|R
