5000|$|The {{greatest}} number of differences between Tunisian and standard Arabic is not due to the borrowing from other languages but to a shift in meaning of several Arabic roots. For example, [...] means [...] "serve" [...] <b>in</b> Standard <b>Arabic</b> but [...] "work" [...] <b>in</b> Tunisian <b>Arabic,</b> as opposed to [...] means [...] "work" [...] <b>in</b> Standard <b>Arabic</b> but was narrowed to [...] "do" [...] in Tunisian Arabic; and [...] meaning <b>in</b> Tunisian <b>Arabic</b> was broadened to [...] "go" [...] from [...] "walk".|$|R
50|$|However, most Libyans {{were not}} acquainted of these {{previous}} experiments. Moreover, after the political change on September 1, 1969, any alphabet {{other than the}} Arabic one had been banned in writing any signs or tablets, so Libyan officials were uninterested in writing tablets or signs in foreign alphabet. People who were interested, either Libyan or foreign, tried to write the names after bringing {{them back to their}} Standard Arabic origin, sometimes far from reality.

Another place named <b>in</b> Standard <b>Arabic.</b> “Marsa Al Burayqa”, <b>in</b> Libyan <b>Arabic,</b> “Marsa El Breiga”, and the Italians wrote it Mersa Brega.

5|$|Even {{before the}} advent of printing, the visual {{appearance}} of poetry often added meaning or depth.

25|$|As for {{novels and}} short stories, most authors who fluently know Tunisian Arabic prefer to write <b>in</b> Standard <b>Arabic</b> or <b>in</b> French.
