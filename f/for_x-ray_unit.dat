More than 15 hospitals, twenty <b>X-ray</b> <b>units</b> in total, were encompassed in this research. Patient doses were estimated based on results of X-ray tube output measurements. Finally, doses were compared with Reference levels. Higher dose values were observed <b>for</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>units</b> with 50 kVp. In comparison with digital units, doses from other procedures are significantly higher...|$|R

40|$|The pMOS {{dosimeters}} sensitivity (Tyndall National Institute, Cork, Ireland) to gamma and X-ray irradiation and 2000 h fading at {{room temperature}} is presented. The radiation fields were created using a 60 Co source for two dose ranges (1 - 5 Gy and 10 - 50 Gy) as well as <b>for</b> <b>X-ray</b> <b>units</b> of a 280 kV spectrum for a single dose range from 0. 1 to 1 Gy. Irradiation was performed in low-field mode (no gate bias during irradiation, Virr = 0 V), sensitivity characterized by the threshold voltage shift {{as a function of}} the absorbed radiation dose and time after irradiation. Linear dependence between the threshold voltage shift and the absorbed radiation dose was only established for pMOS dosimeters which were irradiated by gamma rays in the dose range of 1 to 5 Gy. Obtained results show that the sensitivity of these components is much higher in case of X-ray radiation than in that of gamma ray radiation. Moreover, the fading of irradiated pMOS dosimeters with X-rays is higher than in the ones irradiated with gamma rays. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. 171007...|$|R

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVES: The aims of {{this study}} were to review the {{literature}} on intraoral digital radiography in endodontic treatment with focus on technical parameters and to propose recommendations for improving the quality of reports in future publications. STUDY DESIGN: Two electronic databases were searched. Titles and abstracts were selected according to preestablished criteria. Data were extracted using a model of image acquisition and interpretation. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 233 titles and abstracts; 61 reports were read in full text. Recent reports presented technical parameters more thoroughly than older reports. Most reported important parameters <b>for</b> the <b>x-ray</b> <b>unit,</b> but <b>for</b> image interpretation only about one-half of the publications cited resolution of the display system and fewer than one-half bit depth of the graphics card.

40|$|The proper {{characterization}} of an <b>X-ray</b> <b>unit</b> is necessary <b>for</b> {{the utilization of}} the source as a dosimetry calibration standard. Upon calibration, the <b>X-ray</b> <b>unit</b> can be used <b>for</b> <b>X-ray</b> calibrations of survey, diagnostic, and reference-class, instruments and <b>for</b> <b>X-ray</b> irradiations of personnel dosimeters. It was {{the goal of this}} research to provide the Radiation Calibration Laboratory at Oak Ridge National Laboratory with a characterized research <b>X-ray</b> <b>unit</b> {{that could be used in}} reference dosimetry. The energy spectra were characterized by performing half value layer measurements and by performing a spectral analysis. Two spectral reconstruction techniques were investigated and compared. One involved using a previously determined detector response matrix and a backstripping technique. The other reconstruction technique was developed for this research using neural computing. A neural network was designed and trained to reconstruct measured X-ray spectra from data collected with a high- purity germanium spectroscopy system. Five X-ray beams were successfully characterized and found to replicate the ANSI N 13. 11 and the National Institute of Standards Technology X-ray beam codes. As a result, these prepared X-ray beams have been used for reference dosimetry. It has been shown that a neural network can be used as a spectral reconstruction technique, which contributes less error to the lower energy portion of the spectrum than other techniques...|$|R

5000|$|During the Spanish-American War, Saÿen was {{assigned}} to the army hospital at Ft McPherson, Georgia. In a brief article published {{at the end of that}} war, Saÿen described his military service, the status of medical x-rays in the Army at that time, and also proposed the construction of a mule-driven <b>x-ray</b> laboratory <b>for</b> field use. This proposal was never implemented. In 1917, as the United States drifted towards war once again, Saÿen updated his 1898 concept to an [...] "Automobile X-Ray Unit". He wrote a detailed proposal for five fully outfitted x-ray ambulances at an estimated cost of $2,000 apiece. They were to be sent to France in support of the volunteer force that was being organized under former president Theodore Roosevelt. The vehicles were to be privately financed and Saÿen had recruited artists from the Philadelphia Sketch Club to staff the ambulance teams. A drawing of the vehicle by Saÿen is attached (NMAH Accession file 267872). It is clear from his proposal that Saÿen had stayed up-to-date with x-ray technology because he recommended the use of the new Coolidge x-ray tube which had made the early tubes, including his own design, obsolete. Preferring to field an expeditionary force of regular army units, President Wilson declined to deploy Roosevelt's army and it was subsequently disbanded. Although Saÿen's plan <b>for</b> mobile military <b>x-ray</b> <b>units</b> was never realized, mobile <b>x-ray</b> <b>units</b> were designed and deployed by England, France and the United States.|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{experience}} {{indicates that}} newly available portable hand-held <b>x-ray</b> <b>units</b> provide advantages compared to traditional fixed properly installed and operated <b>x-ray</b> <b>units</b> in dental radiography. However, concern that hand-held <b>x-ray</b> <b>units</b> produce higher operator doses than fixed <b>x-ray</b> <b>units</b> has caused regulatory agencies to mandate requirements {{for use of}} hand-held units that go beyond those recommended by the manufacturer and can discourage {{the use of this}} technology. To assess the need for additional requirements, a hand-held <b>x-ray</b> <b>unit</b> and a pair of manikins were used to measure the dose to a simulated operator under two conditions: exposures made according to the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations and exposures made according to manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s recommendation except for the removal of the <b>x-ray</b> <b>unit</b> 2 ̆ 7 s protective backscatter shield. Dose to the simulated operator was determined using an array of personal dosimeters and a pair of pressurized ion chambers.

40|$|Background: X-ray {{examination}} {{is associated}} with the patient’s exposure to ionizing radiation. The dose values depend on the type of the medical procedure used, the <b>X-ray</b> <b>unit</b> technical condition and exposure conditions selected by X-ray technicians. The aim of this study has been to assess the entrance surface dose (ESD) values received by patients during the limb X-ray examination. The results should help doctors in making the decision about sending patients <b>for</b> <b>X-ray</b> examination. At the same time the <b>X-ray</b> <b>unit</b> condition and examination method performance are important for the radiological protection of the medical staff. Material and Methods: The study covered the total number of 118 <b>X-ray</b> <b>units</b> located in 56 public healthcare entities and private medical centers in the Masovian Voivodeship. The measurement of the radiation dose rate received by patients was based on our own research procedures. Results: The research has found that there are even more than 10 -fold differences in the dose values received by adult patients with several-fold differences in the case of children patients. The broadest dose value range for adult patients was related to femur radiography. The ESD values for this procedure ranged 70. 9 – 765. 2 μGy (with the average value of 319. 7 μGy). The broadest dose value range for children was related to the knee radiography. The range for children aged 5 years old was 11. 8 – 95. 8 μGy (with the average value of 48. 9 μGy). Conclusions: It is essential to immediately implement X-ray room working procedures for the purpose of performing diagnostic examinations based on the existing model procedures.

40|$|The first {{national}} recommendations for radiation protection were {{given by the}} British Roentgen Society (1915) and American Roentgen Society (1922). The basis for modern radiation protection was given in the recommendations of ICRP (ICRP 26) in 1977. Dental education in all Nordic countries takes five years and leads to the competence of using intraoral radiography in Sweden and intraoral and panoramic radiography Norway and all dentomaxillofacial radiological (DMFR) units in Denmark and Finland. There is obligatory special training for using panoramic units in Sweden. For performing CBCT examinations and interpreting the images, a specialist degree in oral-maxillo-facial radiology is required in Sweden and Norway. Dental assistants and hygienists can perform intraoral radiography under the responsibility of a dentist. In Sweden and Norway dental hygienists can also record caries and periodontal diseases, although in Sweden all radiographs must be shown to the dentist. In Denmark and Norway the dental hygienists may be responsible <b>for</b> a dental <b>x-ray</b> <b>unit,</b> and they can refer the patient for a radiographic examination. Updating education is mandatory only in Finland according to EU guidelines. The demands for dental radiographic units are very similar in all countries. Quality assurance programs are regulated by law in Finland, Sweden and Denmark. The programs comprise daily, monthly or yearly checks of radiographic procedures.

40|$|The modern {{approach}} to the radiation protection of the patients from medical exposure is mainly {{based on the principle}} of optimization using diagnostic reference levels. Implementation of diagnostic reference levels and optimization in Russian radiological practice is limited due to lack of methodology of data collection and patient dose assessment, investigation and management of abnormally high and low patient doses. Current study is focused on the justification of the diagnostic reference levels concept and practical aspects of establishment of diagnostic reference levels <b>for</b> common radiographic <b>X-ray</b> examinations and their use in clinical practice. It is proposed to establish diagnostic reference levels as the 75 %-percentiles of <b>X-ray</b> <b>unit</b> distribution by the patient standard doses <b>for</b> a given <b>X-ray</b> examination. Methodology <b>for</b> standard doses assessment is presented for different types of <b>X-ray</b> <b>units.</b> Based on the results of dose data collection in different regions of the Russian Federation in 2009 – 2014, the national diagnostic reference levels values are estimated in terms of effective dose for the radiographic examinations of skull, chest, cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine, abdomen and pelvis. The methodology of the optimization process is developed for the hospital use. It includes a comparison of the patient standard doses with the national diagnostic reference levels, investigation and correction of abnormally high and low patient doses. A list of corrective measures is proposed: from additional training of the staff and manual adjustment of the parameters of examinations to the replacement of an <b>X-ray</b> <b>unit.</b> It is conferment that even a limited implementation of the optimization methodology would allow to reduce standard doses with a factor of 1, 5...|$|R
40|$|Background: X-ray {{examination}} {{is associated}} with patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Dose values depend {{on the type of}} medical procedure used, the <b>X-ray</b> <b>unit</b> technical condition and exposure conditions selected. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the dose value received by patients during certain conventional radiography X-ray examinations and to assess the technical condition of medical equipment used for this purpose. Material and Methods: The study covered the total number of 118 conventional diagnostic <b>X-ray</b> <b>units</b> located in the Masovian Voivodeship. The methodology used to assess the conventional diagnostic <b>X-ray</b> <b>unit</b> technical condition and the measurement of the radiation dose rate received by patients are based on test procedures developed by the Department of Radiation Protection and Radiobiology of the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (Warszawa, Poland) accredited for compliance with PN-EN 17025 standard by the Polish Centre for Accreditation. Results: It was found that 84. 7 % of <b>X-ray</b> <b>units</b> fully meet the criteria set out in the Polish legislation regarding the safe use of ionizing radiation in medicine, while 15. 3 % of the units do not meet some of them. The broadest dose value range was recorded for adult patients. Particularly, during lateral (LAT) lumbar spine radiography the recorded entrance surface dose (ESD) values ranged from 283. 5 to 7827 μGy (mean: 2183. 3 μGy).
