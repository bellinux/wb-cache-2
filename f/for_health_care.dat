The National Center for Medical Readiness (NCMR) {{is also in the}} Dayton area. The center includes Calamityville, which is a state-of-the-art disaster training facility. Over a period of five years, Calamityville is estimated to have a regional economic impact of $374million. Also, the Neurological Institute at Miami Valley Hospital is an institute focused on the diagnosis, treatment, and research of neurological disorders.|$|E
5|$|Globally, {{there were}} 87 million {{unwanted}} pregnancies in 2005, of those 46 million resorted to abortion, of which 18 million were considered unsafe, resulting in 68,000 deaths. The {{majority of these}} deaths occurred in the developing world. The United Nations considers these avoidable with access to safe abortion and post-abortion care. While abortion rates have fallen in developed countries, but not in developing countries. Between 2010–2014 there were 35 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44, a total of 56 million abortions per year. The United nations has prepared recommendations <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> workers to provide more accessible and safe abortion and post-abortion care. An inherent part of post-abortion care involves provision of adequate contraception.|$|E
5|$|Hobgood et al. {{argue that}} one key {{component}} in equipping nations to develop emergency medical systems {{is to identify}} the aspects of training that are essential <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> providers. In their view, a standard curriculum is useful for identifying core issues, even if countries have very different needs and resources. To address this goal, the International Federation for Emergency Medicine developed a model curriculum in 2009. This initiative seeks to provide a minimum basic standard that can be tailored to {{the specific needs of}} the various nations implementing training in emergency medicine. It is targeted towards all medical students in order to produce a minimum competency in emergency care for all physicians, regardless of their specialty.|$|E

In 2003, the Abahuzamugambi Cooperative made US$35,000 in net profits. Of this, 70 percent was divided among the farmers at US$0.75 per kilogram provided, an amount {{more than three times}} that paid to other coffee growers in Rwanda and sufficient to pay <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> and education services which were not previously affordable. The remaining 30 percent was invested back into the cooperative and spent on buying calcium carbonate, an agricultural lime used to reduce acidity in the soil caused by run off of minerals during rainfall.|$|E
5|$|While in Vietnam, the {{veterans}} were {{told not to}} worry, and were persuaded the chemical was harmless. After returning home, Vietnam veterans began to suspect their ill health or the instances of their wives having miscarriages or children born with birth defects {{might be related to}} Agent Orange and the other toxic herbicides to which they had been exposed in Vietnam. Veterans began to file claims in 1977 to the Department of Veterans Affairs for disability payments <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> for conditions they believed were associated with exposure to Agent Orange, or more specifically, dioxin, but their claims were denied unless they could prove the condition began when they were in the service or within one year of their discharge.|$|E
5|$|C-SPAN {{continues}} to expand its coverage of government proceedings, {{with a history of}} requests to government officials for greater access, especially to the U.S. Supreme Court. In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders in the House and Senate, requesting that negotiations <b>for</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> reform be televised by C-SPAN. Committee meetings on health care were broadcast subsequently by C-SPAN and may be viewed on the C-SPAN website. In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker John Boehner requesting changes to restrictions on cameras in the House. In particular, C-SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated cameras to the existing government-controlled cameras in the House chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request. A previous request to Speaker Designate Nancy Pelosi in 2006, to add C-SPAN's cameras in the House chamber to record floor proceedings, was also denied. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables, the cameras are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress. Requests by C-SPAN for camera access to non-government events such as the annual dinner by the Gridiron Club have also been denied.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in Emergency Department (ED) visits <b>for</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> across North America. Those with mental illness are at an increased risk for frequent ED visitation, often visiting for non-urgent reasons. While a plethora of literature exists examining frequent ED use <b>for</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> there is little known about those who use the ED for non-urgent psychiatric complaints. The purpose of this secondary data analysis was to explore the independent predictors of non-urgent ED use <b>for</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> A total of 13, 114 observations were examined using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations modeling. The findings suggest the following characteristics are predictive of non-urgent ED use <b>for</b> mental <b>health</b> care: age, season, time of day, access to primary <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> mode of arrival, hospital type, patient diagnosis and referral source. Unadjusted analyses also suggest that the wait time, the main provider in the ED, residential status, and the disposition status are associated with non-urgent ED use <b>for</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> Future research should aim to incorporate a prospective study design and a qualitative methodology to gain an understanding of the contextual factors that influence those using the ED <b>for</b> nonurgent mental <b>health</b> <b>care...</b>|$|R
