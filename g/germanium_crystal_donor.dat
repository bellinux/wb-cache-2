The study was conducted using a p- type coaxial GC 1518 detector made of a high-purity germanium produced by Canberra Company and LabSOCS mathematical efficiency calibration program.

Nanowires exhibit up to 1. 48 % strain and an absorption threshold down to 0. 73 eV, which is in good agreement with theoretical computations for the Gamma-LH transition, showing that the nanowire geometry is an efficient way of applying tensile uniaxial stress along the [111] axis of a <b>germanium</b> <b>crystal...</b>|$|R
