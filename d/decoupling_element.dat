Most array coil designs {{typically}} employ a combination of geometrical and additional techniques, such as isolating preamplifiers for element-to-element decoupling. The development of array coils for small animal MRI is of increasing interest. However isolation preamplifiers are expensive and not ubiquitous at the field strengths typically employed for small animal work (4. 7 T, 9. 4 T, etc). In addition, isolating preamps complicates the designs of coils for transmit SENSE since they do not decouple during transmitting. Therefore, this thesis reexamines a "tried and true" method for <b>decoupling</b> coil <b>elements.</b> In this work five different coils for mouse imaging at 200 MHz are presented: a 16 leg trombone design quadrature birdcage coil and four geometrically decoupled volume phased array coils. The first mouse array coil is a two saddle quadrature coil with a circularly polarized field. The second coil is a four channel transmit/receive volume array coil that is decoupled purely geometrically, {{without the need for}} other forms of decoupling. The third array coil is a modified 'open' configuration to facilitate the loading of animals. The fourth coil presented is a 'tunable' decoupling coil, where the geometric <b>decoupling</b> between <b>elements</b> is 'tunable', in order to compensate for different loading conditions of the coil.

40|$|Recent {{evolutions}} in wireless mobile communications {{have shown}} that by employing multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO) technology at both the transmitter and receiver, both the wireless system capacity and reliability can be enhanced {{without the need for}} increasing the power transmitted or using more spectrum. Despite a considerable amount of research have been done on the design of MIMO and diversity handset antennas, the design of low profile, small footprint and multi-standard (wideband or multiband) diversity antennas on handset devices remains a challenging issue. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to present new antenna structures for handset MIMO and diversity applications. As the MIMO antenna design can be conducted either using multiple element antennas (MEA) or isolated mode antenna technology (IMAT), the work in this thesis is fallen in these two general design themes (areas). The first area under investigation concerns multiport antennas (IMAT antennas). It has the following two contributions: • A novel dual-feed water-based antenna is designed from a low cost liquid material with a very high dielectric constant (pure water). The isolation between feeds is achieved by two back to back L-shaped ground plane strips. A prototype is made and the optimised diversity parameters are obtained, the results show that this design has a good diversity performance over the frequency range of 2. 4 – 2. 7 GHz. • A new and low profile (h = 3 mm) planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) with a coplanar-feed is presented. It has a wideband response over the frequency range of 2. 35 – 3. 25 GHz. The design is based on a comparative study on the mutual coupling between different feed arrangements. As a result, the coplanar feed is employed in the proposed antenna; the polarization diversity is achieved by exciting two orthogonal radiation modes. The isolation between the feeds is achieved by an L-shaped ground plane slot. Both simulated and measured results demonstrate that the design is a very good candidate for mobile diversity and MIMO applications. The second investigation area concerns multiple element antenna (MEA) systems for wideband and multiband handset applications. It includes the following contributions: • Three antenna systems of the planar inverted-L (PILA) antenna (h = 5 mm) are employed for wideband handset diversity applications over the frequency range of 1. 7 – 2. 85 GHz: 1) The first design has a dual-element PILA in which both the pattern and spatial diversities are employed; one antenna element is located on the upper edge of the ground plane while the other is located on the lower edge. 2) The second design represents a more compact dual-element PILA antenna in which the two elements are placed on the same ground plane edge (collocated on the same edge). The antenna isolation is achieved using a parasitic <b>decoupling</b> <b>element</b> inserted between the two elements. A novel approach for the design of the parasitic <b>decoupling</b> <b>element</b> is proposed. It is based on stepped impedance resonator circuit theory. As a result, more space is saved with this design (footprint = 385 mm 2) over the first design (footprint = 702 mm 2). 3) The third design is a four-element PILA system in which two antenna pairs (one pair at the upper edge which the other pair is located on the lower edge on the system PCB). All the prototypes are made and evaluated; the results show excellent diversity performance over the applications in the frequency range of 1. 7 - 2. 7 GHz. • A dual-element hexa-band antenna is proposed for smartphone MIMO applications. It consists of two elements: a hexa-band metallic frame antenna and a hepta-band PILA antenna coupled with a meandered shorted strip as an internal antenna. The isolation is achieved due to the resulted orthogonal radiation patterns, especially, at 0. 85 GHz. The optimized antenna is made and tested and the results show that this design covers a hexa-band and is particularly suitable for GSM 850 / DCS 1800 / PCS 1900 / UMTS 2100 / LTE 2500 / LTE 3600 smartphone applications...|$|E
40|$|Adequate {{control of}} the stator {{currents}} is a fundamental requirement for several high-performance induction motor (IM) control schemes. In this context, classical linear controllers remain widely employed due to their simplicity and success in industrial applications. However, the models and methods commonly used for control design lack valuable information –which is fundamental to guarantee robustness and high performance. Following this line, the design and existence of linear fixed controllers is examined using individual channel analysis and design. The studies here presented aim to establish guidelines {{for the design of}} simple (time-invariant, low order, stable, minimum-phase and decentralized), yet robust and highperformance linear controllers. Such characteristics ease the implementation task and are well suited for engineering applications, making the resulting controllers a good alternative for the stator currents control required for high-performance IM schemes; e. g., field oriented, passivity-based and intelligent control. Illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the analysis and controller design of an IM, with results validated in a real-time experimental platform.

40|$|Abstract. Radiatively driven winds {{occur in}} all main {{sequence}} stars (Babel 1995, 1996). However, {{due to the}} weak coupling between the photon absorbing metals and the inert elements H and He, {{the wind in the}} low temperature domain is fractionated: He decouples from the wind at Teff < 25 000 K, and below 17 000 K even H. The <b>decoupled</b> <b>elements</b> fall back {{to the surface of the}} star thus creating overabundances and abundance stratifications. These anomalies, however, become manifest only if atmospheric turbulence is suppressed (say by magnetic fields). In order to prove the validity of the described scenario, all Bp stars for which reliable fundamental parameters exist, are discussed on the basis of the (augmented) (g, Teff) -diagram of Babel (1996). It is shown that the fractionation process is able to explain the observed temperature sequence of He-rich and He-poor stars, additionally to classical diffusion processes. A necessary condition is that a magnetic field is present. This explains why only a fraction of B stars exhibits H/He anomalies. While classical diffusion operates in the quiet zones (no wind) of a star, fractionation takes place above the wind bases...|$|R

40|$|Ever-increasing {{integrated}} circuit (IC) power densities and peak temperatures threaten reliability, performance, and economical cooling. To address these challenges, thermal analysis must be embedded within IC synthesis. However, detailed thermal analysis requires accurate three-dimensional chip-package heat flow analysis. This has typically {{been based on}} numerical methods that are too computationally intensive for numerous repeated applications during synthesis or design. Thermal analysis techniques must be both accurate and fast for use in IC synthesis. This article presents a novel, accurate, incremental, self-adaptive, chip-package thermal analysis technique, called ISAC, for use in IC synthesis and design. It is common for IC temperature variation to strongly depend on position and time. ISAC dynamically adapts spatial and temporal modeling granularity to achieve high efficiency while maintaining accuracy.

Each technique enables orders of magnitude improvement in performance while preserving accuracy when compared with other state-of-the-art adaptive steady-state and dynamic IC thermal analysis techniques.
