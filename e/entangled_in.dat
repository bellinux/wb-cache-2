Hitcham's bequest had meanwhile become <b>entangled</b> <b>in</b> the law courts and work did not begin on the poorhouse until the late 1650s, by which time the internal buildings of castle were being broken up for the value of their stone; the chapel had been destroyed in this way by 1657.|$|E
5|$|All three {{thresher}} shark species were reassessed from Data Deficient to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2007. The rapid {{collapse of the}} Californian subpopulation (over 50% within three generations) prompted concerns regarding the species' susceptibility to overfishing in other areas, where fishery data is seldom reported and aspects of life history and population structure are little-known. In addition to continued fishing pressure, common threshers are also taken as bycatch in other gear such as bottom trawls and fish traps, and are considered a nuisance by mackerel fishers as they become <b>entangled</b> <b>in</b> the nets.|$|E

5|$|During {{the process}} of {{catching}} the commercialized fish, the Amazon river dolphins {{get caught in the}} nets and exhaust themselves until they die, or the local fishermen deliberately kill the dolphins that become <b>entangled</b> <b>in</b> their nets. The carcasses are discarded, consumed, or used as bait to attract a scavenger catfish, the piracatinga (Calophysus macropterus). The use of the Amazon river dolphin carcass as bait for the piracatinga dates back from 2000. The increasing consumption demand by the local inhabitants and Colombia for the piracatinga has created a market for distribution of the Amazon river dolphin carcasses to be used as bait throughout these regions.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{entanglement}} of the inflaton field which initially entangled with those of another field on observables like power spectrum are known {{in the context of}} the Schrödinger field theory. To clarify this effect in Heisenberg picture, there were some attempts to construct the initial entangled state by making use of an entangled transformation (like Bogoliubov transformation) between the Bunch-Davies vacuums and squeezed states. We study the role of the time-dependent <b>entangled</b> transformation <b>in</b> the Schrödinger field theory. We derive the relation between two vacuum states which their mode functions are transformed by the <b>entangled</b> transformation <b>in</b> Schrödinger picture. We discuss that the time-dependency of the entanglement parameter is inevitable and only in the first order of the entanglement parameter perturbation this time-dependency vanishes.

5|$|Entanglement {{can result}} in {{mortality}} because when the seals get trapped in marine debris such as fishing nets they cannot maneuver or reach the surface to breathe. Marine fisheries can potentially interact with monk seals via direct and indirect relationships. Directly the seal can become snared by fishing equipment, <b>entangled</b> <b>in</b> discarded debris, and even feed on fish refuse. International law prohibits the intentional discarding of debris from ships at sea. Monk seals {{have one of the}} highest documented rates of entanglement of any pinniped species.|$|E

5|$|Fisheries {{also have}} {{negative}} effects on seabirds, and these effects, particularly on the long-lived and slow-breeding albatrosses, {{are a source of}} increasing concern to conservationists. The bycatch of seabirds <b>entangled</b> <b>in</b> nets or hooked on fishing lines has had a big impact on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Overall, many hundreds of thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year, a source of concern for some of the rarest species (for example, only about 2,000 short-tailed albatrosses are known to still exist). Seabirds are also thought to suffer when overfishing occurs.|$|E

5|$|Fishing gear is {{the biggest}} threat to loggerheads in the open ocean. They often become <b>entangled</b> <b>in</b> longlines or gillnets. According to the 2009 status review of loggerheads by the Fisheries Service, {{drowning}} from entanglement in longline and gillnet fishing gear is the turtles’ primary threat in the North Pacific. They also become stuck in traps, pots, trawls, and dredges. Caught in this unattended equipment, loggerheads risk serious injury or drowning. Turtle excluder devices for nets and other traps reduce the number being accidentally caught.|$|E
