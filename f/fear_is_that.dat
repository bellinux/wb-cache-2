5|$|Keeping rats as pets {{can come}} with the stigma that rats {{supposedly}} transmit dangerous diseases to their owners. One <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> all rats carry plague, when in fact R. norvegicus is not among the list of species considered a threat. In 2004, an outbreak of salmonella in the United States was connected to people who owned pet rats. However, it has been determined that a pet rat's initial exposure to salmonella, {{along with many other}} zoonotic rat diseases, typically indicates exposure to wild rodent populations, either from an infestation in the owner's home, or from the pet's contaminated food, water, or bedding.|$|E
25|$|Political parties universally tend {{to attract}} those {{addicted}} to fame and careerism.... Clearly, the biggest barrier to green electoral victory {{is the lack}} of proportional representation. Greens have been elected around the world in countries with PR.... The <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a leader will shift the party to the right, cutting the Greens' radical edge....|$|E
25|$|The {{call for}} a single leader would {{compromise}} the party's commitment to radical democracy. It also suggests a failure to think about strategy in any real sense. The <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it {{could be part of}} a more extensive shift towards a new green politics of shallow environmentalism, rather than a thorough critique of an unequal, profit-motivated society.|$|E
60|$|Peter Hope's <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the {{gambling}} fever was spreading to all classes of society.|$|R
60|$|There {{was no time}} to think; {{my great}} <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the devil in the cabin would kill Polly Ann. Just then I heard her calling out to me.|$|R
5000|$|... "My {{father and}} mother's {{greatest}} <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{their four children}} might take their wealth for granted and grow up spoiled and arrogant..... They wanted us to learn early that with wealth comes responsibility." ...|$|R
25|$|Parents {{involved}} in polyamorous relationships often {{keep it a}} secret because of the risk that it will be used by an ex-spouse, or other family member, as grounds to deprive them of custody of or access to their children. The <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it will be used in family disputes much as homosexuality has been used in the past.|$|E
25|$|In early 2006, {{the problem}} of {{wastewater}} management arose during a controversy over a planned arena for the Brooklyn Nets in nearby downtown Brooklyn. The project at that point, now called Pacific Park, was to include a basketball arena and 17 skyscrapers, with the resulting sewage would flow into antiquated combined sewers that can overflow when it rains. The Gowanus Canal has 14 combined sewer overflow points, so the <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the additional wastewater from the arena would lead to more frequent overflows in the canal.|$|E
25|$|Other people {{raise the}} issue of hazards to the animals in their working environments. The risk of {{accidental}} detonation of a mine by an animal is of concern to some; the Navy maintains that the chances of this are minimal, because the animals are trained not to touch the mines, which in any case are specifically designed not to be detonated by marine animals. Another <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> opposing forces, aware of mine-hunting dolphins in a given area, may shoot dolphins in the water, leading to deaths of both NMMP and native animals.|$|E
60|$|Flushed with triumph--for {{her only}} <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{she might not}} be able to locate Joe in time--Rilla rang the Pryor ring. This time she had not such good luck for she drew Whiskers-on-the-moon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pard, I never feared I'd lose <b>that.</b> All I've <b>feared</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I'd <b>be</b> club-footed.... Let me look," [...] {{replied the}} cowboy, and he raised {{himself on his}} elbow. Wade lifted the {{unsightly}} foot.|$|R
50|$|They were {{organised}} into groups of seven {{and they would}} prepare food for themselves, often displaying considerable ingenuity in their recipes. A popular <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they might <b>be</b> poisoned by the government, although this never happened.|$|R
25|$|Many of the world's countries, {{including}} many in Sub-saharan Africa, the Middle East and South East Asia, {{have seen a}} sharp rise in population {{since the end of}} the Cold War. The <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> high population numbers are putting further strain on natural resources, food supplies, fuel supplies, employment, housing, etc.; in some of the less fortunate countries. The population of Chad has, for example, ultimately grown from 6,279,921 in 1993 to 10,329,208 in 2009, further straining its resources. Nigeria is witnessing a similar growth in population, strained resources and a possible over-population problem in the near future.|$|E
500|$|Diocletian found {{much to be}} {{offended}} by in Manichean religion. His championing of traditional Roman cults impelled him to use the language of religious fervor. The proconsul of Africa forwarded Diocletian an anxious inquiry on the Manichees. In late March 302, Diocletian responded: the Manicheans [...] "have set up new and hitherto unheard of sects {{in opposition to the}} older creeds so that they might cast out the doctrines vouchsafed to us in the past by divine favour, for the benefit of their own depraved doctrine". He continued: [...] "..our <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> with the passage of time, they will endeavour...to infect...our whole empire...as with the poison of a malignant serpent". [...] "Ancient religion ought not to be criticized by a new-fangled one", he wrote. The Christians of the empire were vulnerable to the same line of thinking.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the first}} leg, Shankly was adamant that Liverpool would still progress: [...] "This tie {{is by no}} means over yet. We will win easily. We will smash in at least seven goals. This was ridiculous. Ajax played {{defensive}} football on their own ground. We never play well against defensive teams." [...] Such was the shock at the result that Shankly's claim was taken seriously. The defeat convinced Shankly that adopting Ajax's patient, passing style was the key to success in Europe. The defeat is still Liverpool's record defeat in European competition. Michels was worried that Liverpool might adopt aggressive tactics in the second leg: [...] "Our <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Liverpool may try to eliminate us through rough play. They showed some of this rough play in the first leg and they will play even harder in front of their own supporters". He also admitted that his side had some luck in the first leg but was adamant they would progress: [...] "There are not many great players in this Liverpool side, but they are all fighters. I agree we had some luck in Amsterdam, but I am sure we will go through." ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{there would}} <b>be</b> a chain {{reaction}} as the company liquidated its securities to cover its debt, leading to a drop in prices, which would force other companies to liquidate their own debt creating a vicious cycle.|$|R
50|$|Zaire also militarily {{supported}} {{the government of}} Chad's Hissein Habré's during that country's civil war. Mobutu's primary <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a pro-Gaddafi government would take hold in Chad and threaten Sudan and the Central African Republic, both countries contiguous with Zaire.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2012, {{a viewer}} of The 700 Club wrote {{that one of}} her biggest <b>fears</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> her {{children}} and husband would not go to heaven “because they question why the Bible could not explain the existence of dinosaurs.” ...|$|R
500|$|Brisingr begins {{about three}} days after the events in Eldest conclude. It {{continues}} the story of the Inheritance Cycle and takes place on the fictional continent of Alagaësia during a struggle for power as the small country Surda and a rebel group called the Varden attempts to overthrow the larger Empire. They are supported mainly by elves, dwarves, and Urgals, [...] but the Empire is populated with large numbers of humans, who far outnumber Surda and its allies. The Inheritance Cycle focuses on the story of a teenage boy named Eragon and his dragon Saphira. Eragon {{is one of the few}} remaining Dragon Riders, a group that governed Alagaësia in past times but were almost destroyed by a Rider named Galbatorix, who took control of the land. Galbatorix's greatest <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a new Rider will rise up and usurp his position as king of the Empire, so when he finds out about Eragon and his dragon, he sends his servants after them in an effort to capture them. Eragon and Saphira are forced to flee from their home, and decide to join the Varden.|$|E
2500|$|Intense Western {{diplomatic}} {{pressure was}} also being exerted on Abdullah Abdullah {{to cut a}} deal. According to The Telegraph, the <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if Karzai defies Washington and appoints his own choice of allies to key ministerial roles, he would be more [...] "difficult for the West to influence".|$|E
2500|$|Although the memorial's {{brochures}} were {{translated into}} {{at least ten}} languages, the languages did not include Arabic. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) questioned this decision in letters to memorial directors, and ADC director of communications and advocacy Raed Jarrar said: [...] "Our <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there is a political intention behind the exclusion". A memorial representative told the New York Post, [...] "As Arabic-speaking visitors currently represent our 25th-largest group, Arabic translations are not yet among the initial foreign-language editions." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{thought he}} could write it now plainly enough for it to pass; his <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the prison {{authorities}} would not act upon it, unless presented by a well-known official personage, without sending to Robespierre to have it verified.|$|R
6000|$|... "SACRE TONNERRE," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "but it <b>is</b> <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> accursed Englishman himself--the Scarlet Pimpernel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are many}} more inside," [...] Guy said, [...] "and methinks {{that we could have}} held out for another hour yet if it had been needed. Indeed, the only thing <b>that</b> I <b>feared</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they might set fire to {{the lower part of the}} house." ...|$|R
2500|$|There is a {{long history}} in this country of a {{separation}} of church and state, and the exemption of religious property from taxes. I think it's a dangerous precedent to set, because if the government can assess taxes for one purpose, what is to prevent it from assessing taxes on church and synagogue property in general? [...] My great <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> down the line governments might assume that the right to tax gives them the right to regulate. That would be an extremely dangerous breakdown of {{the separation of church and}} state.|$|E
2500|$|... "I'm {{sure that}} I'm a Muslim. My worst <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people in Europe may {{consider}} and treat me as {{a critic of}} Islam. I'm not. I'm not a new Salman Rushdie, and don't want to be welcomed and treated as such. I'm a researcher. I'm critical of old and modern Islamic thought. I treat the Qur'an as a naṣṣ (text) given by God to the Prophet Muhammad. That text is put into a human language, which is the Arabic language. When I said so, I was accused of saying that the Prophet Muhammad wrote the Qur’an. This is not a crisis of thought, but a crisis of conscience." ...|$|E
2500|$|The route {{includes}} unstable {{areas such}} as Trebanos, liable to landslide and earthquake due to extensive historic mineworkings, which are deemed too dangerous for mains gas to be piped to local homes. Local people raised concerns and permission was denied in November 2006, but the pipeline was still laid in the area. As one local said: [...] "If there was a shift or a landslip again, my <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the pipe would fracture, and we'd get an enormous gas leak." [...] National Grid claimed that the pipeline would be secure. An undiscovered Roman road was found during {{the building of the}} pipeline near Brecon and was partially destroyed as a result.|$|E
50|$|Against the norms, the {{authorities}} of the Province then assigned {{him to the}} friary in his hometown. This was contrary to the norms, because the <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> young friars would find themselves distracted by family and friends, thereby stunting their spiritual growth. Yet the level of his detachment <b>was</b> so great <b>that</b> they felt <b>that</b> this <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> largely unwarranted in his case.|$|R
5|$|One of her {{greatest}} <b>fears</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Kenshin might return to wandering, leaving her alone again, {{and she is}} jealous if another girl (such as Takani Megumi) is interested in him. In the series' first story arc, Kaoru gains a student (Myojin Yahiko) and loses one (Tsukayama Yutaro).|$|R
60|$|My <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the brute}} would rush on us. But it did not. For all that dreadful night we saw or heard it no more. Indeed, I began {{to hope that}} after all the bullet had reached some mortal part and that the great ape was dead.|$|R
2500|$|Interpersonal {{communication}} {{has been}} a growing issue {{as more and more}} people have turned to social networking as a means of communication. [...] "Benniger (1987) describes how mass media has gradually replaced interpersonal communication as a socializing force. Further, social networking sites have become popular sites for youth culture to explore themselves, relationships, and share cultural artifacts". Many teens and social networking users may be harming their interpersonal communication by using sites such as Facebook and MySpace. Stated by Baroness Greenfield, an Oxford University neuroscientist, [...] "My <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these technologies are infantilizing the brain into the state of small children who are attracted by buzzing noises and bright lights, who have a small attention span and who live for the moment".|$|E
2500|$|The {{writing is}} also notable for its minimal use of dialogue. Josh Brolin {{discussed}} his initial nervousness with having so little dialogue to work with: I {{mean it was}} a fear, for sure, because dialogue, that's what you kind of rest upon as an actor, you know? [...] Drama and all the stuff is all dialogue motivated. You {{have to figure out}} different ways to convey ideas. You don't want to overcompensate because the <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> you're going to be boring if nothing's going on. You start doing this and this and taking off your hat and putting it on again or some bullshit that doesn't need to be there. So yeah, I was a little afraid of that in the beginning.|$|E
2500|$|However, in a 2012 interview, Ebadi has stated: [...] "The [...] {{people want}} to stop {{enrichment}} but the government doesn't listen. Iran is situated on a fault line and people are scared of a Fukushima type of situation happening. We want peace, security, and economic welfare, and we cannot forgo all of our other rights for nuclear energy. The government claims it is not making a bomb. But I am {{not a member of}} the government, so I cannot speak to this directly. The <b>fear</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if they do, Israel will be wiped out. If the Iranian people are able to topple the government, this could improve the situation. [...] the people of Iran rose up and were badly suppressed. Right now, Iran is the country with the most journalists in prison. This is the price people are paying." ...|$|E
60|$|Joe's {{greatest}} <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> while {{asking for}} shelter, {{he would be}} forced to explain why he was taking the princess with him for a long tramp, when the day was so warm; and, dangerous though such a course might be, he was resolved to tell only the truth.|$|R
50|$|Binns {{was summoned}} to Washington by Thomas O. Enders.I was told to stop human rights {{reporting}} except in back channel. The <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> if it came into the State Department, it will leak, Binns recalled. They wanted to keep assistance flowing. Increased violations by the Honduran military would prejudice that.|$|R
60|$|Now {{that the}} captain had raged himself away from the Delaplaine house her spirits rose, and her great <b>fear</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the {{corvette}} might not leave port before the brig came in. If Dickory should hear {{of the things that}} captain had said--but she banished such thoughts from her mind, she could not bear them.|$|R
