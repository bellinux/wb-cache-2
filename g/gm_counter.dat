40|$|Photon {{spectrometry}} {{was performed}} in monoenergetic neutron fields which are produced by nuclear reactions. For this purpose time-of-flight experiments were carried out employing NE 213 liquid scintillation detectors. The photon spectral fluences were obtained by multichannel unfolding using the HEPRO package. The unfolded spectral fluences served to establish routine and simple prompt photon monitoring with a Geiger Mueller (<b>GM)</b> <b>counter</b> by linking the <b>GM</b> <b>counter</b> counts to the prompt photon ambient dose equivalent calculated with the spectral fluences and the conversion coefficients. With this method the photon dose equivalent holds for photon energies above E_#gamma# #propor to# 300 keV, which for most neutron energies make the main contribution to the dose equivalent. For linking the spectral fluences with the <b>GM</b> <b>counter</b> counts, the latter had to be corrected for neutron and natural photon background induced counts. Further on it is dealt with photons from activation products and prompt photons not originating from the target. (orig.)

40|$|A {{microcomputer}} is used {{to measure}} the radioactive rays generated by radioactive source automatically, and to display its results graphically on real time basis.

The microcomputer sums them up, and displays a running histogram on the CRT screen. All operations of the counter unit and the microcomputer synchronize with the timing clock signal whose period is 0. 1 second.

40|$|GM {{counters}} {{are often}} used in radiation detection since they generate a strong signal which can be easily detected. The working principal of a <b>GM</b> <b>counter</b> {{is based on the}} interaction of ionizing radiation with the atoms and molecules of the gas present in the counter's tube. Free electrons created {{as a result of this}} interaction become initial electrons, i. e. start an avalanche process which is detected as a pulse of current. This current pulse is independent of the energy imparted on the gas, that being the main difference between a <b>GM</b> <b>counter</b> and the majority of other radiation detectors. In literature, the dependence on the incidence of radiation energy, tube's orientation and characteristics of the reading system are quoted as the main sources of measurement uncertainty of GM counters. The aim of this paper is to determine the dependence of measurement uncertainty of a <b>GM</b> <b>counter</b> on the volume of its counter's tube. The dependence of the pulse current on the size of the counter's tube has, therefore, been considered here, both in radial and parallel geometry. The initiation and expansion of the current pulse have been examined by means of elementary processes of electrical discharge such as the Markov processes, while the changes in the counter's tube volume were put to test by the space - time enlargement law. The random variable known as the 'current pulse in the counter's tube' (i. e. electrical breakdown of the electrode configuration) has also been taken into account and an appropriate theoretical distribution statistically determined. Thus obtained theoretical results were then compared to corresponding experimental results established in controlled laboratory conditions...|$|E

The experiment was launched from the ESRANGE Space Center (68 °N, 21 °E) on the 17 th of March 2015 {{at the beginning of the}} most intense geomagnetic storm within the preceding 10 years. The experiment provided the opportunity to measure the intensity of cosmic rays in the Polar Region up to an altitude of 88 km above sea level. 				 					Methods: The experiment employed Geiger-Müller (<b>GM)</b> <b>counters</b> oriented with their axes perpendicular to each other in order to measure the cosmic ray intensity during the flight of the rocket.

The response of these monitors was measured using a set of anodized-aluminum beta sources for the five isotopes: Carbon- 14, Technetium- 99, Cesium- 137, Chlorine- 36 and Strontium/Yttrium- 90. The surface emission rates of the sources are traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with a precision of one relative standard deviation equal to 1. 7 %. All measurements were made in reproducible geometry, mostly using aluminum source holders. All counts, significantly above background, were collected to a precision of 1 % or better. The study of the hand-held probes included measurements of six air gaps from 0. 76 to 26. 2 mm. The energy response of the detectors is well-parameterized {{as a function of}} the average beta energy of the isotopes (C 14 = 50 keV, Tc 99 = 85, Cs 137 = 188, C 136 = 246, and Sr/Y 90 = 934).

Gold foils and TLDs were used to measure the thermal flux in the vicinity of 252 Cf AT sources to compare with the results calculated using MCNP. As the fast neutron energy spectrum did not markedly changed at increasing distances from the AT source, neutron dosimetry results obtained with paired ion chambers using fixed sensitivity factors agreed well with MCNP results and those in the literature.

Further, concentrations of 238 U and 40 K are also high compared to normal abundance in crustal rocks but their magnitude is comparatively less than that of thorium. The average concentrations of 238 U (i. e. U(?–?)), 232 Th and 40 K are found to be 33, 459 ppm and 3 %, respectively, in soils and 312, 1723 ppm and 5 %, respectively, in the granitic rocks. Maximum concentrations of 238 U, 232 Th and 40 K are found to be 95, 1194 ppm and 4 %, respectively, in soils and 1434, 10, 590 ppm and 8 %, respectively, in the granitic rocks.

High energies are utilized to estimate the concentration of actual 238 U, 232 Th and 40 K using a NaI(Tl) detector, however, low energies are used for the same in an HPGe detector.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 A threestage, {{differentially}} pumped ion accelerator is used {{to produce}} low energy argon ions, which in turn, are used to bombard the surfaces of plane nickel single crystals. Nickel atoms ejected from the crystals are counted using the radioac tive tracing method. From {{the analysis of the}} angular distri butions of ejected atoms, the study of low energy single crystal sputtering is made possible. The experimental procedure consisted of pumping down the accelerator to a pressure of 10 ⁻⁹ torr, outgassing the target by electron bombardment, generating a welldefined and singly ionized argon ion beam, and bombarding the target with ions for a time which is shorter than that required for gases to form a monolayer on the target surface at the existing residual partial pressure of absorbable gases. Three targets, consisting of Ni ⁶³ being electroplated on the surfaces of two (110) and one (111) nickel crystals respec tively, were used in this work. Each target was bombarded with 40 - 600 eV argon'ions at normal incidence except one of the (110) crystals which was mounted so that its surface normal made an angle of 20 ° with respect to the incident ion beam. Nickel atoms ejected from the target were collected on a thin molyb denum foil. Immediately after each bombardment, the collector foil was cut into narrow strips, and the residual radioactivity of each strip was analyzed by placing it under a thin endwindow <b>GM</b> <b>counter.</b> The angular distributions of nickel atoms ejected from the crystals were found to peak at directions corresponding to the closepacked crystal directions. The atomic intensity of each peak increased as the ion energy increased while its halfwidth remained about 8. 5 °. These results indicate that at low energy ion bombardment atoms are ejected intensely around the close packed direction from a single crystal and focused collisions may indeed narrow the distribution of the ejected atoms around this direction. The sputtering yield curves for nickel atoms ejected along the [110] direction from a (110) and a (111) nickel crystals showed that the atomic ejection process was affected by the structure and atomic binding of the crystal surface and by the ion energy. At the same ion energy, the [1107 sputtering yield obtained from a (110) crystal was higher than that from a (111) crystal. For ejecting nickel atoms with low energy argon ions along a closepacked crystallographic direction, the most probable threshold energy for a (110) nickel was found to be 10 eV. For a (111) nickel crystal, the threshold appeared to have a value of about 15 eV. These results indicate that the surface binding energy may be a dominant factor in the atomic ejection process because the binding energy in a (111) nickel crystal is higher than that in a (110) nickel crystal. The experimental thresholds are higher than the threshold values predicted by Harrison Magnuson's. theory. This may indicate that the atomic ejection process is a complicated event. Further investigations, both experimental and theoretical, are desired in order to explain the ejection phenomenon near the threshold and to claim the final value of threshold energy...|$|E
