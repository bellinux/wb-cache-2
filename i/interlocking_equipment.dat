2500|$|The {{deployment}} of ATS-A involved upgrading signals to be compatible for future CBTC retrofitting, {{as well as}} consolidating operations from 23 different master towers into the Power Control Center. Parsons Corporation helped the MTA install the system on the [...] of A Division track, as well as did some preliminary planning for ATS on the B Division. The project, valued at $450 million, cost $200 million. The project's completion was delayed by five years, and it ultimately took 14 years to implement ATS-A. The long duration of ATS-A's deployment was attributed to bad communication between workers and contractors; because of {{the uniqueness of the}} New York City Subway's <b>interlocking</b> <b>equipment,</b> which necessitated extra workarounds; because of the MTA's use of its own workers rather than of contractors' workers; because of the poor training that contractors had; and because of bad communication interfaces. In addition, the MTA kept missing deadlines for testing ATS. The single biggest issue during the project, however, was that MTA and the contractors did not cooperate well.|$|E

50|$|The first {{signal box}} was {{provided}} on the seaward platform beside {{the north end}} of the waiting room but this was replaced by a new two-storey signal box on 9 September 1920 on the opposite platform. So as to fit on the narrow platform the brick-built lower storey which contained the <b>interlocking</b> <b>equipment</b> was narrower than usual, with the upper storey was vaulted out from this to give a full size operating floor.|$|E
50|$|This {{is carried}} out by safety {{critical}} computers called 'evaluators' which are centrally located, with the detection points located at the required sites in the field. The detection points are either connected to the evaluator via dedicated copper cable or via a telecommunications transmission system. This allows the detection points to be located significant distances from the evaluator. This is useful when using centralised <b>interlocking</b> <b>equipment</b> but less so when signalling equipment is distributed at the lineside in equipment cabinets.|$|E

It is clad in corrugated iron, and has a pitched roof with bracketed eaves and a raised central roof light. It also has timber platforms supported on large cut logs.|$|E

50|$|In 1999, {{the section}} between Ribnitz-Damgarten West and Stralsund was {{completely}} renovated. The {{appearance of the}} stations on the track changed greatly. The signal boxes were replaced by a new electronic interlocking in Velgast. Consequently, all signal boxes that were no longer needed and freight sidings were demolished and the <b>interlocking</b> <b>equipment</b> that was housed in the old station buildings was removed. The remaining buildings are largely empty, and have been secured against unauthorised entry. The closed stations were completely demolished {{in the course of}} the renovation.

40|$|Objective: To {{discuss the}} {{implications}} of widespread implementation of alcohol ignition interlocks. Method: We base our discussion on data from Finland including crash statistics and surveys collected from criminal justice professionals and general driving population. Results: Alcohol ignition interlocks are an effective preventive measure against drunk driving when installed in the vehicles of convicted drunk drivers. However, once they are removed from the vehicles, drivers typically return to their habit of drinking and driving. Furthermore, {{for a number of}} reasons, the proportion of convicted drunk drivers that install an interlock in their vehicles is quite small. Therefore, many stakeholders believe that the solution to the drunk driving problem will come when <b>interlocks</b> become standard <b>equipment</b> in all new vehicles. However, drunk driving is a complex sociopsychological problem, and technology can rarely offer a solution to such complex problems. Consequently, many aspects of such interventions might be difficult to identify and include in cost-benefit analysis. Conclusion: We express caution about requiring an <b>interlock</b> as standard <b>equipment</b> in all new vehicles...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} lessons about managing radiation safety programs often {{are derived from}} involvement in accidents that release unusual amounts of contamination or result in unusually high doses to persons. Large releases result in contamination levels, air concentrations, and intakes that are measurable and {{can be related to}} amounts and radiotoxicities of nuclides in specific processes, and to probabilities of escape and intake. This information then can be used to better establish design and operational requirements. Lessons presented here include: the need to convince management that at least monthly routine inspection of safety <b>interlocks,</b> <b>equipment</b> and procedures are necessary by independent inspectors (e. g., Radiation Safety staff) when lethal exposures are possible; at least three independent checks of treatment plans and exposures should be required in radiation oncology treatments; detailed quantitative analyses of staffing requirements should be performed at least annually by Radiation Safety Officers to advise their administrators of the minimum staff needed to ensure safe operations; and internal laboratory procedures, or appropriate contractual arrangements with commercial bioassay services, must be prepared in advance of work with highly radiotoxic quantities of radioactive material. Examples of situations managed or audited by the author that revealed these principles are: a Van de Graaff incident ultimately resulting in quadruple amputation of an experienced operator; several overexposures in radiation oncology at a major university medical center that was required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to employ an independent auditing team; an extensive contamination incident at a major medical research center that resulted in the shutdown of a multi-million dollar research program by the NRC; and internal exposure cases managed at the University of Pittsburgh that resulted from inadequate safety and health physics procedures...|$|R

5000|$|Power signalling, however, was {{installed}} in two signal boxes, one at {{the north and the}} other at the south of Doncaster station. The work was planned and some equipment was on site before the Second World War but the installation was not commissioned until 1949. Searchlight colour light signals and electric point machines were controlled from switch panels. The <b>interlocking</b> <b>equipment</b> was unique being a sequence switch interlocking system manufactured by Standard Telephone Company using telephone switching techniques to the technical specification of the signal engineer of the then Southern Area of the London and North Eastern Railway. The sequence switches consisted of a rotary contact shaft which was rotated to a route position and proved a circuit through contact wipers. Each switch had a [...] "home" [...] position and eleven route positions. When a route was initiated, a clutch was engaged on the appropriate switch to rotate it into its correct position thus setting up the appropriate interlocking circuits through other switches and relays. The installations proved to be remarkably reliable, serving a very useful purpose but were eventually life expired.|$|E
5000|$|A new {{signalling}} installation, {{believed to}} be the first in the world to include electronic <b>interlocking</b> <b>equipment,</b> was brought into use recently at Henley-on Thames... The branch was reduced to single track, with a passing loop at Shiplake in 1961. The line is continuously track circuited, and there are acceptance switches or levers at Twyford, Shiplake, and Henley. The equipment is designed to perform the basic functions of railway signalling apparatus by controlling the interlocking of signals, so that correct distances are maintained between trains that follow or cross or approach each other. This is done by means of computor sic techniques using arrangements of plug-in electronic [...] "bogie" [...] units, in which transistors and magnetic cores perform [...] "logical" [...] switching operations. There are no magnetic relays of conventional type... The installation at Henley is operated from a mosaic-type signalling panel, of the pattern already standard on the Western Region, controlling 36 routes on the [...] "entrance-exit" [...] principle with a switch at the entrance point of the route and a pushbutton at its exit. Track, signal, point, and other miscellaneous indications are also shown on the panel in the usual way. For reasons of economy, all points and facing point locks are worked manually from the existing lever frame, from which all the mechanical interlocking has been removed.|$|E

50|$|The {{second major}} way of {{manufacturing}} fibre preforms is Braiding. Braiding is {{suited to the}} manufacture of narrow width flat or tubular fabric and is not as capable as weaving {{in the production of}} large volumes of wide fabrics. Braiding is done over top of mandrels that vary in cross-sectional shape or dimension along their length. Braiding is limited to objects about a brick in size. Unlike standard weaving, braiding can produce fabric that contains fibres at 45-degree angles to one another. Braiding three-dimensional fibres can be done using four step, two-step or Multilayer Interlock Braiding.Four step or row and column braiding utilizes a flat bed containing rows and columns of yarn carriers that form the shape of the desired preform. Additional carriers are added to the outside of the array, the precise location and quantity of which depends upon the exact preform shape and structure required. There are four separate sequences of row and column motion, which act to interlock the yarns and produce the braided preform. The yarns are mechanically forced into the structure between each step to consolidate the structure in a similar process to the use of a reed in weaving. Two-step braiding is unlike the four-step process because the two-step includes a large number of yarns fixed in the axial direction and a fewer number of braiding yarns. The process consists of two steps in which the braiding carriers move completely through the structure between the axial carriers. This relatively simple sequence of motions is capable of forming preforms of essentially any shape, including circular and hollow shapes. Unlike the four-step process, the two-step process does not require mechanical compaction the motions involved in the process allows the braid to be pulled tight by yarn tension alone. The last type of braiding is multi-layer interlocking braiding that consists of a number of standard circular braiders being joined together to form a cylindrical braiding frame. This frame has a number of parallel braiding tracks around the circumference of the cylinder but the mechanism allows the transfer of yarn carriers between adjacent tracks forming a multilayer braided fabric with yarns interlocking to adjacent layers. The multilayer interlock braid differs from both the four step and two-step braids in that the interlocking yarns are primarily in the plane of the structure and thus do not significantly reduce the in-plane properties of the preform. The four-step and two-step processes produce a greater degree of interlinking as the braiding yarns travel through the thickness of the preform, but therefore contribute less to the in-plane performance of the preform. A disadvantage of the multilayer <b>interlock</b> <b>equipment</b> is that due to the conventional sinusoidal movement of the yarn carriers to form the preform, the equipment is not able to have the density of yarn carriers that is possible with the two step and four step machines.|$|R
40|$|There {{are nine}} {{separate}} zones of high sensitivity smoke detection (HSSD) at Dzero. These zones, their coverage, their condition thresholds, and {{their response to}} conditions are described in {{the table in the}} 'Zones & Responses' section of this document. This is an 'air-sampling' smoke detection system. Each zone is formed of a network of pipes which contain strategically sized and located air sampling holes. Each zone has a fanbox/detector head that continuously draws air into the holes and through the pipes to the detector head where it is evaluated for combustion products. The fanbox/detector heads are located on the Dzero detector platform and in the trusses. Each fanbox/detector head has a remotely located display control card (DCC) for monitoring the level of obscuration of the air sample. This remote equipment is located {{on the roof of the}} moving counting house. The DCC for each zone is networked to a single intelligent interface module (11 M), also on the roof of the MCH, that collects the information from all nine zones and delivers it to the Dzero control room via an isolated RS- 485 link to an operators console. This console is replicated via a 'remote video, keyboard, mouse system' in the DAB 4 th floor entry lobby for use by fire response personnel. Internal thresholds that have been set in the DCC via the operators console provides alarm level I (lowest), alarm level 2, and alarm level 3 (highest) for each zone. These alarms are then used as inputs to the Fermilab FIRUS system, and as <b>interlocks</b> to <b>equipment.</b> This system is nearly 2000 times more sensitive than conventional smoke detectors.

40|$|Regional {{computer}} {{interlocking system}} (RCIS) is a signal control system, which performs {{all of the}} interlocking logic operations and implements the centralized control on multiple stations using one set of <b>interlocking</b> <b>equipment</b> alone. There are two diverse RCIS solutions in China, namely, the central-ized interlocking scheme and the distributed interlocking scheme. The main defi ciency of the former lies in that the entire system would be paralyzed once the central <b>interlocking</b> <b>equipment</b> fails. The lat-ter overcomes the fl aw of the former and can disperse the danger. However, it is not suitable for some small stations due to higher upfront investment.

As a safety‚Äìcritical system, the RCIS is broadly applied but the investigations on it are rarely reported in reliability and safety. Based on it, this paper establishes the Markov model of the RCIS and investigates its reliability and safety. During modeling some signifi cant factors, such as common-cause failure, cov-erage rate of diagnostic systems, online maintainability, and periodic inspection maintenance, and as well as diverse failure modes, are fully considered.

The most common equipment types involved were: Continuous miner (12 % of all underground injuries); Bolting machines (6 %); LHD (8 %); Longwall (7 %); Personnel Transport (4 %); and Shuttle Car (3 %). The most common combinations of equipment and mechanism were: strains while handling items associated with continuous miner or bolting machines; strains, or being struck by, or caught between, while drilling or bolting on a continuous miner or bolting machine; driving or traveling over rough roads {{in a variety of}} equipment; being struck by while operating Longwall equipment. Rare, but high potential consequence events reported during the period included: interactions between personnel and mobile equipment; interactions between personnel and Longwall shield movements; transport equipment collisions.

It {{is vital}} to provide safety and {{availability}} of the railway transportation systems. For serving such a purpose, route conflicts should be prevented in the first place. However, railway transportation systems are complex in nature and this {{makes it hard to}} accomplish such a task. That is where railway interlocking systems come into play. Interlocking systems are utilized so that trains can safely move on the railway. This can only be achieved by an efficiently designed interlocking system. Otherwise, any simple flaw in the design would lead to route conflicts, thus rendering the railway transportation system unsafe. Efficient design and implementation of railway interlocking systems constitutes the main subject of this study. In this thesis, Petri Nets would be used for designing and implementation of interlocking systems. Petri Nets is a modeling tool that is able to represent systems both visually and mathematically. Visual aspects of Petri Nets are utilized to model the general structure of a system. Nevertheless, mathematical aspects of Petri Nets are used to realize the system dynamics. Petri Nets makes it possible to represent the system behavior mathematically via state equation. One can exploit mathematical features of Petri Nets to perform modeling, simulation, testing and verification of systems. In order to model large-scale systems using Petri Nets, particular enhancements have become necessary to overcome arising shortfalls and to improve modeling capability. Modular Petri Nets is introduced to model complex systems in modular way. This is useful for simplifying the investigation of the system. Colored Petri Nets is proposed to make it easy to keep track of specific events taking place within the system. Timed Petri Nets is created to represent time-dependent events in the system. Together with these enhancements, Petri Nets has become more powerful modeling tool. Specific arc types are defined to further enhance the modeling capability of Petri Nets. Inhibitor arcs are defined to enable a certain transition to take precedence over the other transitions. Using inhibitor arcs, it becomes possible to visually represent prioritization mechanism in Petri Nets. Enabling arcs are introduced to keep tokens in the input places while triggering the transition. An enabling arc is very similar to an ordinary arc. The only difference is the fact that when a transition is triggered, there is no token removal from the input place(s) connected to enabling arc(s). Nullifier arcs are proposed to remove all of the tokens from an input place at once when a transition is triggered. This functionality is used to implement the resetting mechanism in Petri Nets. In the literature, the state equation for Petri Nets is used to model and analyze systems mathematically. However, there are not any formalized state equations defined in order to cover inhibitor, enabling and nullifier arcs. Therefore, {{we do not have the}} opportunity to represent the systems mathematically when these types of arcs are involved. In this thesis, the state equation for Petri Nets is revisited and modified to obtain a novel state equation called ‚Äúgeneralized state equation‚Äù. This state equation can be used to mathematically represent the behavior of inhibitor, enabling and nullifier arcs. Besides, software is developed and utilized to demonstrate the application of generalized state equation on an industrial automation system. Railway signalization systems play a major role in providing safety and reliability for the railway transportation systems. The main purpose of railway signalization systems is to prevent train collisions from happening. A railway signalization system is composed of three main elements such as traffic control center, interlocking system and the field equipments. Traffic control center is responsible for management and observation of the entire railway traffic. Route requests are created and train positions, switch positions, signal states are observed by traffic control center. There is a two-way communication between the traffic control center and the interlocking system. Route requests originated by the traffic control center is sent to the interlocking system and at the same time the status information coming from the field equipments is sent by the interlocking system to the traffic control center. As a result of this information exchange, the interlocking software processes the route requests and these requests are either accepted or rejected regarding the status of the field <b>equipments.</b> <b>Interlocking</b> software only accepts route requests that do not lead to train collisions. Interlocking system both gathers information from and sends commands to the field equipments. The field equipments form the infrastructure of the railway signalization system. The field equipments are composed of switches, track circuits and signals. Switches are mechanical devices that enable trains to change direction. Generally, switches have two positions such as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and ‚Äúreverse‚Äù. When a switch is in ‚Äúnormal‚Äù position, train crossing over this switch does not change its direction, whereas in ‚Äúreverse‚Äù position switch causes train crossing over it to change its direction. Track circuits inform the interlocking system about the existence of a train on the railway. Signals are used to inform trains about whether the railway is occupied or not. ‚ÄúRed‚Äù light means the railway is occupied, whereas ‚Äúgreen‚Äù light means the railway is free. The interlocking system is the decision maker in a railway signalization system. The main task of the interlocking system is to evaluate route requests coming from the traffic control center. During this evaluation, existing route requests and status of the field equipments are considered by the interlocking system. As a result, reasonable requests are accepted and the field equipments are locked accordingly to apply these requests. Unsuitable requests that cause collisions are rejected and are not applied. Interlocking system uses interlocking table to make these decisions. Interlocking table has entries for all of the possible routes and each of these entries identifies the conditions under which the corresponding route request should be accepted. It is clear that the reliability of a railway signalization system is directly related to the interlocking system. Therefore, safety standards called EN 50126, EN 50128 and EN 50129 are established by CENELEC to define general safety requirements for the railway interlocking systems. Both the hardware and the software components of an interlocking system must fulfill these standards. It is essential to use formal methods for the design of the software in order to meet these security standards. In this thesis, the interlocking system would be implemented using PLC. In order to accomplish this task, at first, the interlocking system would be modeled using Petri Nets. Then, this Petri Nets model would have to be converted into PLC code. During literature research, it is observed that only visual aspects of Petri Nets are used for such a conversion process. And also, in the literature, there are not any available studies that exploit mathematical aspects of Petri Nets in order to realize interlocking systems using PLC code that is defined in IEC 61131 - 3 standards. In order to maintain an infrastructure that is favorable for programming, mathematical aspects of Petri Nets should be used for the conversion process. In this thesis, an efficient method is proposed to make the conversion from mathematical model of Petri Nets into PLC code that is defined in IEC 61131 - 3 standards. Then, this method is used to implement the interlocking system with PLC. In this method, conversion of Petri Nets into PLC code is directly accomplished by making use of the incidence matrix. At the same time, the proposed method also provides elimination of avalanche effect from which most of the systems suffer. In addition, software is developed to implement this methodology and usage of this software is shown on a case study. One can use this software to perform conversion of Petri Nets into PLC code automatically. In this study, in order to apply aforementioned method, a real-life railway station is considered. At first, the interlocking system of this station is designed modularly using Petri Nets. Modularity is provided by means of partitioning the interlocking system into subsystems. Then each of these subsystems is modeled using Petri Nets, which is further converted into PLC code using proposed methodology. This concludes design and implementation of the interlocking system using Petri Nets. Finally, SCADA application is developed to test the interlocking system and on this application, the implementation of this interlocking system is verified. DoktoraPh...|$|R
