5|$|In {{addition}} to combat, {{there is also}} a mild role-playing component. An experience point system levels up the player character and their <b>equipment</b> (weapons, armor, shields, helms, and magic rings). <b>Equipment</b> pieces have special properties and a predetermined amount of experience points required to master them. Mastering a piece of <b>equipment</b> increases its sale value but decreases the player's experience gain by 20%. Upon leveling up or mastering a piece of <b>equipment,</b> players gain attribute points that can be allotted towards four character attributes: health, attack, shield power, or magic. Each point can only be allocated once and is a permanent upgrade to the character. Players can purchase new <b>equipment</b> using in-game money from sacks and treasure chests found throughout the castle, defeated enemies, and sales of unused <b>equipment.</b> In-game money can be purchased with real money within the game.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Distribution {{substations}} {{feed power}} to the actual consumers through distributors and service lines. The main <b>equipments</b> are generators and transformers. To protected these <b>equipments</b> and for stability purpose, over-voltages and over currents protection are important to consider. Lightning {{is one of the}} most serious causes of over-voltage. If the power <b>equipments</b> especially at outdoor substation are not protected, the over-voltage will cause burning of insulation. Lightning arrester can protect the damages of <b>equipments.</b> This paper describes the arrester type, lightning terminal and earthing plan of Dagon East substation in Myanmar. DynaVar station class and intermediated arrester (Vrated = 72 kV and I charge (max) = 10 kA) are used in this substation. Most of substation <b>equipments</b> are designed to match with the insulation coordination. If the insulation <b>equipments</b> are higher, the cost is also high. So, to relax this, the lightning arrester must be put in front of the protected <b>equipments</b> and protected zone. For this purposes, this paper specially indicates the safety and saving cost of <b>equipments</b> for overvoltage protection in distribution substation.
