50|$|The {{unstable}} lava {{formation of}} The Barrier {{has in the}} past unleashed several debris flows in the area below the lake, most recently in 1855-56 forming a large boulder field which gives Rubble Creek its name. Concerns about the Barrier's instability due to volcanic, tectonic, or heavy rainfall activity prompted the provincial government to declare the area immediately below it unsafe for human habitation in 1981. This led to the evacuation of the nearby village of Garibaldi, and the relocation of residents to new recreational subdivisions away from the hazard zone. Should the Barrier completely collapse, Garibaldi Lake would be entirely released and downstream damage in the Cheakamus and Squamish Rivers would be considerable, including major damage to the town of Squamish and possibly an <b>impact</b> <b>wave</b> on the waters of Howe Sound that would reach Vancouver Island.|$|E
5000|$|Friday Night Lights star Taylor Kitsch plays Gambit in {{director}} Gavin Hood's 2009 film X-Men Origins: Wolverine. In the storyline Remy is {{a former}} prisoner of William Stryker for 2 years, who was dubbed [...] "Gambit" [...] from his guards as he kept beating them in poker. After two years he managed to escape the facility, but was later confronted by Wolverine, who {{wanted to know where}} Stryker's base was to destroy it. Gambit, mistakenly believing he was sent to recapture him, attacked and later interrupted a fight between Wolverine and Sabretooth, inadvertently letting Sabretooth escape and robbing Wolverine of his revenge. After Wolverine defeats him, Gambit sees he is sincere and flies him to Stryker's base. At the conclusion, Gambit briefly returns to his side, and, after Wolverine's memories are lost, tells him his 'name': Logan. He offers to help get Logan and Silverfox's body off the island, but Logan turns him down, stating he can find his own way. In Origins, his trademark brown trench coat has been rendered to a dark brown leather duster, the character does not wear gloves or boots, and his signature red on black eyes have been reduced to normal colored eyes that merely glow red when he uses his power (mainly because the producers felt his eyes would be too distracting). Gambit's powers are also altered slightly, in that the objects he charges do not seem to explode, instead merely hitting with much more force—his playing cards hit with enough force to knock people through brick walls, he can strike the ground to create an <b>impact</b> <b>wave</b> to send his foes flying, and he can charge his staff to cleanly punch holes in walls to climb them without damaging the staff. This version of Gambit seems to be lightly inspired by the Ultimate X-Men version of the character, who is a retired thief and sports a [...] "cleaned up" [...] accent that is a Southern/Cajun mix.|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} in numerical simulation of cascading processes involving mass movements and lakes has recently risen strongly, {{especially as the}} formation of new lakes in high-mountain areas {{as a consequence of}} glacier recession can be observed all over the world. These lakes are often located close to potentially unstable slopes and therewith prone to impacts from mass movements, which may cause the lake to burst out and endanger settlements further downvalley. The need for hazard assessment of such cascading processes is continuously rising, which demands methodological development of coupled numerical simulations. Our study takes up on the need for systematic analysis of the effect of assumptions taken in the simulation of the process chain and the propagation of the corresponding uncertainties on the simulation results. We complemented the research of Adv Geosci 35 : 145 - 155, 2014 carried out at Lake 513 in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru, by focusing on the aspects of (a) ice-avalanche scenario development and of (b) analysis of uncertainty propagation in the coupled numerical simulation of the process chain of an <b>impact</b> <b>wave</b> triggered by a rock/ice avalanche. The analysis of variance of the dimension of the overtopping wave was based on 54 coupled simulation runs, applying RAMMS and IBER for simulation of the ice avalanche and the <b>impact</b> <b>wave,</b> respectively. The results indicate (a) location and magnitude of potential ice-avalanche events, and further showed (b) that the momentum transfer between an avalanche and the <b>impact</b> <b>wave</b> seems to be reliably representable in coupled numerical simulations. The assessed parameters—initial avalanche volume, friction calibration, mass entrainment and transformation of the data between the models—was decisive of whether the wave overtopped or not. The overtopping time and height directly characterize the overtopping wave, while the overtopping volume and the discharge describe the overtopping hydrograph {{as a consequence of the}} run-up rather than the wave. The largest uncertainties inherent in the simulation of the <b>impact</b> <b>wave</b> emerge from avalanche-scenario definition rather than from coupling of the models. These findings are of relevance also to subsequent outburst flow simulation and contribute to advance numerical simulation of the entire process chain, which might also be applied to mass movements other than rock/ice avalanches...|$|E

We focused on landslides in lateral moraines as possible triggers. Detailed geomorphological, geophysical, and satellite radar interferometric investigations of the Palcacocha Lake moraine (Cordillera Blanca, Peru) together with laboratory tests on samples from the site provided data for slope stability calculations using GeoSlope software and hydrodynamic <b>impact</b> <b>wave</b> modeling using the Iber code. We identified landslides that could affect Palcacocha Lake and calculated their stability (factor of safety) under specified conditions, including variable water saturation and earthquake effects.

The height of impact waves triggered by a landslide in 2003 and the potential wave heights from newly identified, possibly active landslides were calculated, based on landslide volume estimates, detailed lake bathymetry, and basin topography. Results show that potential future landslide-triggered waves could have similar properties to the 2003 <b>impact</b> <b>wave.</b> Evidence gathered in this study suggests that glacial lake outburst floods triggered by landslides from moraines, however, would be probably smaller than floods resulting from other types of slope processes (e. g., ice/rock avalanches) if dam breach is not taken into account.

40|$|The {{need for}} coastal structures, such as breakwaters, at great water depths is rapidly {{increasing}} {{as a result}} ofthe increasing draught of large vessels and off-shore land reclamations which can, for instance, {{be used for the}} benefit of the expansion of harbours and related industrial activities. In water depths greater than approximately 10 m vertical breakwaters may be the best alternative compared to ordinary rubble mound breakwaters, in terms of performance, total costs, environmental aspects, construction time and maintenance. However, these breakwaters with plane vertical front walls can be exposed to enormous hydraulic loads, such as <b>wave</b> <b>impacts.</b> <b>Wave</b> <b>impacts</b> are dynamical hydraulic loads with, for instance, a very short duration (in the order of magnitude of ms) and a very high peak force which can exceed the quasi-static wave load on a vertical breakwater more than 10 times. As it is described in chapter 1 "Introduction", this report contains the reflection of a research which has been performed on the effect of <b>wave</b> <b>impact</b> loads on the stability of vertical breakwaters. This Master's thesis is divided into three parts: A - <b>Wave</b> <b>impact</b> loads on vertical breakwaters In chapter 2 "Hydraulic loads on vertical breakwaters" different types of quasi-static and <b>wave</b> <b>impact</b> loads are described. Three types of <b>wave</b> <b>impact</b> loads can be distinguished depending on the amount of trapped air between the breaking wave and the plane vertical front wall of a breakwater. In chapter 3 "Wave impact pressures", chapter 4 "Wave impactforces and momentum" and chapter 5 "Special attention to <b>wave</b> <b>impacts</b> with a trapped air pocket" different formulae are presented which can be used to calculate the characteristics of <b>wave</b> <b>impact</b> loads on vertical breakwaters. In chapter 6 "Vertical breakwater design formula and wave impacts" short attention is being paid to the calculation of <b>wave</b> (<b>impact)</b> loads according to the most widely used prediction method for <b>wave</b> (<b>impact)</b> pressures on vertical breakwaters. B - Derivation of models which describe the dynamical behaviour of a vertical breakwater In chapter 7 "Derivation of an analytical mass-spring model of a vertical breakwater", in chapter 8 "Derivation ofa mass-spring-dashpot TILLY model ofthe vertical breakwater" and in chapter 9 "Analysis ofthe structure andfoundation parameters ofthe vertical breakwater" models which can be used to describe the dynamical behaviour and stability of a vertical breakwater which is exposed to <b>wave</b> <b>impacts</b> are treated. A lot of attention is being paid to the influence of the magnitude of the different dynamical properties (mass, stiffuess and damping) of such a model. C - Analysis of different types of <b>wave</b> <b>impact</b> loads on a vertical breakwater and conclusions The "Analysis ofdifferent types ofwave impact loads on a vertical breakwater" is reflected in chapter 10. "Conclusions and recommendations" can be found in chapter 11. It can be concluded that the stability of a vertical breakwater against <b>wave</b> <b>impacts</b> entirely depends on the type ofwave impact load which is to be expected (i. e. rise time, total duration, magnitude of the peak force, the amount of trapped air) and the dynamical properties of the vertical breakwater and its foundation soil (mass, stiffuess and damping). The maximum peak force of a <b>wave</b> <b>impact</b> does not necessarily induce the maximum dynamical response of a vertical breakwater. <b>Wave</b> <b>impacts</b> with relatively low peak forces and long total durations (relative to the eigenperiod(s) of a vertical breakwater, double peaked <b>wave</b> <b>impact</b> forces and <b>wave</b> <b>impacts</b> followed by low frequency force oscillations due to large trapped air pockets seem to be more dangerous for the stability of a vertical breakwater. The amount of momentum is one of the governing properties of a <b>wave</b> <b>impact</b> load concerning the response and stability of a vertical breakwater. The suggestion commonly found in the literature that <b>wave</b> <b>impacts</b> are totally not significant and should not be used for the design of vertical breakwaters could not be confirmed. A dynamical analysis of the behaviour of a vertical breakwater by means of a mass-(elastoplastic) - spring-dashpot computer model should become a necessary part ofthe design process of vertical breakwaters which are exposed to breaking wave loads. The characteristics ofthe <b>wave</b> <b>impact</b> loads to be expected and the foundation characteristics should be obtained form large scale hydraulic model tests and site investigations.

40|$|Since waves have {{enormous}} power {{the design of}} structures to withstand this power is not easy. The history of breakwaters {{is one of many}} failures and damages. This has lead to continuously improving technology in marine construction. Over the years men made it possible to construct breakwaters with high stability against waves. The vertical breakwater is an ideal solution in deep water and in areas where the use of rubble stones is expensive or environmentally less acceptable. Furthermore a vertical breakwater with smooth vertical walls can be exposed to high wave loads, such as impulsive <b>wave</b> <b>impacts.</b> These impacts are characterised by very high pressure and a short duration time. It is believed that these impacts could well be essential to the failure of vertical breakwaters. The duration time of the <b>wave</b> <b>impact</b> is essential for the (dynamic) response of the caisson. For example if the <b>wave</b> <b>impact</b> duration is about the eigenfrequency of the vertical breakwater the response will reach a maximum, and the vertical breakwater could collapse. The objective of this graduation report is to investigate the assumption that <b>wave</b> <b>impact</b> is important with regard to failure of vertical breakwaters. Research has been carried out to investigate the time impact duration for vertical breakwaters and an analogy has been made of <b>wave</b> <b>impacts</b> with impulsive <b>wave</b> load on ships. Also, in order to investigate the (dynamic) response of vertical breakwater a computer model has been designed. With this model the response to the <b>wave</b> <b>impact</b> loads upon the Genoa Voltri breakwater can be estimated. The results of this graduation study is that <b>wave</b> <b>impact</b> do occur, but that the impact duration is much shorter than assumed in the past. The impact forces during these short duration result in little response of the vertical breakwater, since the impact duration is not in the range of the eigenfrequency of the vertical breakwater. It can therefore be concluded that <b>wave</b> <b>impacts</b> are not important for the stability of the Genoa Voltri breakwater. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

The {{purpose of the present}} study is to develop an effective <b>wave</b> <b>impact</b> model to investigate the dynamic behaviors of specific shaped elements as they <b>impact</b> <b>waves.</b> To achieve this objective, a <b>wave</b> <b>impact</b> model with a body swinging on a pendulum system is developed. The body on the pendulum goes through a wave free surface driven by gravity at the pendulum's natural frequency. The system's motion and impact force during the entire oscillation time beginning from the instant of impact are of interest. The impact force is calculated by applying von Karman's method, which is based on momentum considerations. The usual wave forces are presented in the Morison's equation and incorporated into dynamic systems with other wave forces. For each body shape, the dynamic system is described by a strongly nonlinear ordinary differential equation and then solved by a Runge-Kutta differential equation solver. The dynamic response behavior and the impact force time history are obtained numerically and the numerical results show support the selection of a pendulum model as an efficient approach to study slamming loads. The numerical prediction of this model is compared to previous experiments and classification society codes. Moreover, a basic design of <b>wave</b> <b>impact</b> experiments using this pendulum model is proposed to provide a more accurate comparison between numerical results and experimental data for this model. This design will also serve as a first look at the experimental application of the pendulum model for the purpose of forecasting slamming force...|$|R
