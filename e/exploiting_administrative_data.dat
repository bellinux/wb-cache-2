To address these questions, we <b>exploit</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> covering the universe of stamp duty tax returns in the United Kingdom from 2005 - 2011 along with compelling sources of identifying variation.

Second, anticipated and unanticipated changes in the tax schedule allow us to estimate the dynamics of price responses and timing effects on house transactions. Third, a temporary exemption of some properties from the tax—a stamp duty holiday—aimed at stimulating the housing market during recession allows us to provide micro evidence on macro stimulus policy. We find that the effect of transaction taxes on house prices is large (often larger than the tax itself) and that dynamic adjustment to changes in transaction taxes is very fast.

40|$|Though the {{measurement}} and implication of human capital on economic {{growth has been}} well established since the works of Becker in the 1960 s, recently Florida has argued that creative class is superior to human capital in explaining economic growth. The underlying {{difference between the two}} scholars is a measurement approach in which while Becker uses education as indicator of human capital Florida employs occupation as an identifier of the creative class. We <b>exploit</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) over the years 1998 - 2008 and employ system GMM to estimate and compare the effects on regional economic performance of human capital and creative class in Germany where economic performance is measured by GDP growth, employment growth and wage growth. The estimation unveils that analysis of regional economy through creative class in place of human capital can be used as an alternative approach yet the creative class, as has been praised by Florida, is not found to be superior to human capital in explicating economic performance of regions. Indeed, albeit the share of creative class (creative core and creative professionals) and university graduates have positive and robust impacts on GDP growth {{it is by no means}} the share of university graduates that have a far greater impact on economic growth. The opposite holds for employment growth and is inconclusive for wage growth.

Our IV fixed effects estimation results suggest that women?s labor supply is endogenously determined, whereas men?s employment histories can be treated as exogenous. Career interruptions reduce the wage rates of both men and women. Moreover, the wage cuts resulting from unemployment, parental leave and additional home time are larger than the pure human capital effects of missing experience, hinting at a possible stigmatization of workers with discontinuous employment histories.

30|$|The {{frequency}} of labor inspections in Brazil {{increased in the}} late 1990 s. In the years that followed, between 2003 and 2007, formal employment expanded significantly in the country. This paper examines whether these city-level changes in labor inspections could be a significant factor contributing {{to the increase in}} the number of formal labor contracts at the city level. We <b>exploit</b> unique <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> on formal employment on different indicators for job and worker flows—including job creation, destruction, reallocation, accessions, and separations—between 1996 and 2006, and on the intensity of labor inspections, both at the city level. The results show that increases in the enforcement of labor market regulations at the subnational level led to an increase in gross and net formal job creation rates and accession rates in a period when the Brazilian GDP and formal employment were growing and informality rates were declining. In contrast, increases in enforcement of regulations are not significantly correlated with changes in the rate of job destruction. This finding is robust to different specifications and is consistent with a model where formal jobs become more attractive to workers when enforcement of different types of labor regulations increases.|$|R

Using a regression discontinuity design, we first show that the leave extension caused mothers to significantly delay their return to work within the first year after childbirth. We then compare the number and length of spells of long-term sickness absence of returned mothers who gave birth before and after the change in leave legislation. Our findings suggest that among those returned, mothers subject to the leave extension exhibit a higher incidence of long-term sickness absence as compared to control mothers. This also holds true after controlling for observable differences in pre-birth illness histories. At the same time, there are no pronounced effects on mothers' medium-run labor market attachment following the short-run delay in return to work, which might rationalize a negative causal health effect. Breaking down the results by mothers' pre-birth health status suggests that the higher incidence of long-term sickness absence among the treated may be {{explained by the fact that}} the reform has facilitated re-entry of a negative health selection into the labor market...|$|R

Methods: Medical charts for a population-based sample of patients (n = 14, 508) with ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), or TIA discharged from inpatient and emergency departments (ED) in Ontario, Canada, between April 1, 2012 and March 31, 2013, were audited by trained abstractors. Audited data were linked and compared with hospital <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> and physician billing data. The positive predictive value (PPV) of hospital <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> and kappa agreement for the reporting of stroke type were calculated. Kappa agreement was also determined for stroke risk factors and for select stroke-related procedures. Results: The PPV for stroke type in inpatient <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> ranged from 89. 5 % (95 % CI 88. 0 - 91. 0) for TIA, 91. 9 % (95 % CI 90. 2 - 93. 5) for ICH, and 97. 3 % (95 % CI 96. 9 - 97. 7) for ischemic stroke. For ED <b>administrative</b> <b>data,</b> PPV varied from 78. 8 % (95 % CI 76. 3 - 81. 2) for ischemic, 86. 3 % (95 % CI 76. 8 - 95. 7) for ICH, and 95. 3 % (95 % CI 94. 6 - 96. 0) for TIA.
