2500|$|A single {{house could}} have several {{interested}} parties, with the <b>ground</b> <b>landlord</b> or freeholder, being {{unaware of the}} actions of his or her leaseholder. Leaseholders would frequently lease out various parts of a house, while the weekly tenants sublet to lodgers, who sometimes sublet to other lodgers. Per cubic foot the rents in the Old Nichol were four to ten times higher than those of the finer streets of the London West End, averaging between 2s3d to 3s for a single room and around 7s6d for a three-room lodging. This provided high profits to speculative property dealers, which a housing reform campaigner of the time called [...] "the vampyres of the poor". [...] Many of the properties in the Old Nichol were held on fast-expiring leases, and leaseholders thought to {{get to the end of}} the lease without spending any money on maintenance or improvements.|$|E

60|$|The {{incident}} occurred, very luckily, {{during the}} dead season, {{and the evening}} papers took the case up, and made rather a good thing out of it. Jim became quite a hero, I remember. Kind-hearted people wrote, urging that somebody--the <b>ground</b> <b>landlord,</b> or the Government, or some one of that sort--ought {{to do something for}} him. And everybody abused the local vestry. I really think some benefit to Jim might have come out of it all if only the excitement had lasted a little longer. Unfortunately, however, just at its height a spicy divorce case cropped up, and Jim was crowded out and forgotten.|$|E
6000|$|Then it was, as I had no {{idea what}} were the proper [...] "proceedings" [...] to take, the {{brilliant}} idea occurred to me of appealing to Lord Redcar as the <b>ground</b> <b>landlord,</b> and, as it were, our feudal chief, and pointing out to him that his security for his rent was depreciating in old Pettigrew's hands. I added some general observations on leaseholds, the taxation of ground rents, and the private ownership of the soil. And Lord Redcar, whose spirit revolted at democracy, and who cultivated a pert humiliating manner with his inferiors to show as much, earned my distinguished hatred for ever by causing his secretary to present his compliments to me, and his request that I would mind my own business and leave him to manage his. At which I was so greatly enraged that I first tore this note into minute innumerable pieces, and then dashed it dramatically all over the floor of my room--from which, to keep my mother from the job, I afterward had to pick it up laboriously on all-fours.|$|E
60|$|It {{does not}} matter where you look or what {{examples}} you select, {{you will see that}} every form of enterprise, every step in material progress, is only undertaken after the land monopolist has skimmed the cream off for himself, and everywhere to-day the man, or the public body, who wishes to put land to its highest use is forced to pay a preliminary fine in land values to the man who is putting it to an inferior use, and in some cases to no use at all. All comes back to the land value, and its owner for the time being is able to levy his toll upon all other forms of wealth and upon every form of industry. A portion, in some cases the whole, of every benefit which is laboriously acquired by the community is represented in the land value, and finds its way automatically into the landlord's pocket. If there is a rise in wages, rents are able to move forward, because the workers can afford to pay a little more. If the opening of a new railway or a new tramway, or the institution of an improved service of workmen's trains, or a lowering of fares, or a new invention, or any other public convenience affords a benefit to the workers in any particular district, it becomes easier for them to live, and therefore the landlord and the <b>ground</b> <b>landlord,</b> {{one on top of the}} other, are able to charge them more for the privilege of living there.|$|E
50|$|The {{somewhat}} involved {{history of}} the ownership {{and management of the}} Royal Opera House, Covent Garden can be split up into three main categories: the managers of the various theatrical and operatic companies which played there (historically, a mixture of actor-managers and impresarios); the leaseholders of the opera houses built on the land; and the owners of the freehold (ie <b>ground</b> <b>landlords).</b> From the early 20th century the theatre's management tended to be split between a general administrator and a musical/artistic director.|$|R

6000|$|You will {{probably}} {{live as a}} tenant in a house which may either stand alone or {{be part of a}} terrace or collegiate building, but instead of having a private landlord, exacting of rent and reluctant of repairs, your house landlord will very probably be, and your <b>ground</b> <b>landlord</b> will certainly be, the municipality, the great Birmingham or London or Hampshire or Glasgow or such-like municipality; and your house will be built solidly and prettily instead of being jerry-built and mean-looking, and it will have bathroom, electric light, electrically equipped kitchen and so forth, as every modern civilized house might have and should have now. If your taste runs to a little close garden of your own, you {{will probably}} find plenty of houses with one; if that is not so, and you want it badly, you will get other people of like tastes to petition the municipality to provide some, and if that will not do, you will put yourself up as a candidate for the parish or municipal council to bring this about. You will pay very much the sort of rent you pay now, but you will not pay it to a private landlord to spend as he likes at Monte Carlo or upon foreign missions or in financing [...] "Moderate" [...] bill-posting or what not, but to the municipality, and you will pay no rates at all. The rent will do under Socialism what the rates do now. You cannot grasp too clearly that Socialism will abolish rates absolutely. Rates for public purposes are necessary to-day because the landowners of the world evade the public obligations that should, in common sense, go with the rent.|$|E
60|$|Well, then, it is {{said your}} taxes fall too heavily upon the {{agricultural}} landowner and the country gentleman. Now, there is no grosser misrepresentation of the Budget than that it hits the agricultural landowner, and I think few greater disservices {{can be done to}} the agricultural landowner, whose property has in the last thirty years in many cases declined in value, than to confuse him with the <b>ground</b> <b>landlord</b> in a great city, who has netted enormous sums through the growth and the needs {{of the population of the}} city. None of the new land taxes touch agricultural land, while it remains agricultural land. No cost of the system of valuation which we are going to carry into effect will fall at all upon the individual owner of landed property. He will not be burdened in any way by these proposals. On the contrary, now that an amendment has been accepted permitting death duties to be paid in land in certain circumstances, the owner of a landed estate, instead of encumbering his estate by raising the money to pay off the death duties, can cut a portion from his estate; and this in many cases will be a sensible relief. Secondly, we have given to agricultural landowners a substantial concession in regard to the deductions which they are permitted to make from income-tax assessment on account of the money which they spend as good landlords upon the upkeep of their properties, and we have raised the limit of deduction from 12½ per cent. to 25 per cent. Thirdly, there is the Development Bill--that flagrant Socialistic measure which passed a second reading in the House of Lords unanimously--which will help all the countryside and all classes of agriculturists, and which will help the landlord in the country among the rest. So much for that charge.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{not only}} in {{relation}} to investments that this absorption of small parcels of savings goes on. In every town the intelligent and sympathetic observer may see, vivid before the eyes of all who are not blind by use and wont, the slow subsidence of petty accumulations, The lodging-house and the small retail shop are, as it were, social [...] "destructors"; {{all over the country}} they are converting hopeful, enterprising, ill-advised people with a few score or hundreds of pounds, slowly, inevitably into broken-hearted failures. It is, to my mind, the crudest aspect of our economic struggle. In the little High Street of Sandgate, over which my house looks, I should say between a quarter and a third of the shops are such downward channels from decency to despair; they are sanctioned, inevitable citizen breakers. Now it is a couple of old servants opening a [...] "fancy" [...] shop or a tobacco shop, now it is a young couple plunging into the haberdashery, now it is a new butcher or a new fishmonger or a grocer. This perpetual procession of bankruptcies has made me lately shun that pleasant-looking street, that in my unthinking days I walked through cheerfully enough. The doomed victims have a way of coming to the doors at first and looking out politely and hopefully. There is a rich and lucrative business done by certain wholesale firms in starting the small dealer in almost every branch of retail trade; they fit up his shop, stock him, take his one or two hundred pounds and give him credit for forty or fifty. The rest of his story is an impossible struggle to pay rent and get that debt down. Things go on for a time quite bravely. I go furtively and examine the goods in the window, with a dim hope that this time something really will come off; I learn reluctantly from my wife that they are no better than any one else's, and rather dearer than those of the one or two solid and persistent shops that do the steady business of the place. Perhaps I see the new people going to church once or twice very respectably, as I set out for a Sunday walk, and if they are a young couple the husband usually wears a silk hat. Presently the stock in the window begins to deteriorate in quantity and quality, and then I know that credit is tightening. The proprietor no longer comes to the door, and his first bright confidence is gone. He regards one now through the darkling panes with a gloomy animosity. He suspects one all too truly of dealing with the [...] "Stores." ... Then suddenly he has gone; the savings are gone, and the shop--like a hungry maw--waits for a new victim. There is the simple common tragedy of the little shop; the landlord of the house has his money all right, the <b>ground</b> <b>landlord</b> has, of course, every penny of his money, the kindly wholesalers are well out of it, and the young couple or the old people, as the case may be, are looking for work or the nearest casual ward--just as though there was no such virtue as thrift in the world.|$|E

40|$|At {{the dawn}} of the roaring twenties, {{baseball}} was struggling to overcome two of its darkest moments: the death of a player during a Major League game and the revelations of the 1919 Black Sox scandal. At this critical juncture for baseball, two teams emerged to fight {{for the future of the}} game. They were also battling for the hearts and minds of New Yorkers as the city rose in dramatic fashion to the pinnacle of the baseball world. 1921 captures this crucial moment in the history of baseball, telling the story of a season that pitted the New York Yankees against their Polo <b>Grounds</b> <b>landlords</b> and hated rivals, John McGraw’s Giants, in the first all–New York Series and resulted in the first American League pennant for the now-storied Yankees’ franchise. Lyle Spatz and Steve Steinberg recreate the drama that featured the charismatic Babe Ruth in his assault on baseball records in the face of McGraw’s disdain for the American League and the Ruth-led slugging style. Their work evokes the early 1920 s with the words of renowned sportswriters such as Damon Runyon, Grantland Rice, and Heywood Broun. With more than fifty photographs, the book offers a remarkably vivid picture of the colorful characters, the crosstown rivalry, and the incomparable performances that made this season a classic...|$|R

This the landlords did piece by piece, the largest chunk containing 4 acres, 1 rood and 25 perches given to the County Council for allotments in 1941. Nevertheless, the club had sufficient land for two pitches. In 1944 a further portion containing 1.25 acres was taken to build houses on what is now known as Myrtle Avenue. A new lease was then drawn up for the remaining 2 acres and 11 perches for a term of not less than ten years nor more than fifteen years. This meant that the club was reduced to one pitch. Later when a road was made from Royal Terrace to Myrtle Park the club had to give up a small piece of land containing a pavilion.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} compares commonhold, as {{enacted by}} the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002, with 'RMC Leasehold' -long leasehold, with the freehold owned by the leaseholders through a Residents' Management Company. Its thesis is that commonhold is not always superior to RMC Leasehold; that, in several respects, RMC Leasehold may be preferable; and that the two models of ownership should therefore continue to co-exist. It argues that the Aldridge Committee in 1987 ignored the existence of RMC Leasehold, and that therefore its commonhold proposals did not benefit from experience of it. It emphasised the 'wasting asset' deficiency of leasehold, and overlooked the 'mismatch' between the <b>ground</b> <b>landlord's</b> financial stake and its powers, an imbalance which may be advantageous when the leaseholders collectively constitute the landlord. Commonhold and RMC Leasehold are compared, focussing on themes such as the tenurial aspect: how far commonhold can deliver freehold ownership as it is generally understood, {{and the implications of}} its limitations on the control of dispositions; how negative and positive obligations may be enforced within commonhold and RMC Leasehold developments, both between the body corporate and flat-owners and between flat-owners inter se; the levying and status of service charge funds and their commonhold equivalents; how leases and the Commonhold Community Statement may be varied; and the position of the flat-owners if the body corporate becomes insolvent or a majority wishes to sell for redevelopment. The study concludes that, although the inapplicability of forfeiture can be seen as making the unit-holder more secure, the leaseholder has the advantage, both on insolvency, and where the majority wishes a sale; that it is less likely that an RMC Leasehold development will change its character; and that RMC Leasehold may, therefore, be more appropriate for flat-owners who prefer to accept the restrictions inherent in a more regulated community.
