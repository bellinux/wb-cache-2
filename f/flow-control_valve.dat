50|$|Since the {{hydraulic}} pumps are positive-displacement type, the flow rate they deliver is {{directly proportional to}} {{the speed of the}} engine. This means that at high engine speeds the steering would naturally operate faster than at low engine speeds. Because this would be undesirable, a restricting orifice and <b>flow-control</b> <b>valve</b> direct some of the pump's output back to {{the hydraulic}} reservoir at high engine speeds. A pressure relief valve prevents a dangerous build-up of pressure when the hydraulic cylinder's piston reaches the end of its stroke.|$|E

Under suitable conditions, the valve will reflect the pulse back, with increased energy, until a standing wave forms in the tube.|$|E

The 2 -Mw Sodium Test Facility was initially placed in operation on Mar. 15, 1960. Since startup, operation has been continuous except for 12 forced shutdowns required for maintenance of auxiliary steam-system equipment and repair of refractory setting in the gas-fired sodium heater. Essentially no maintenance or adjustment hns been required on sodium components or the steam generator.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} spring valves with the ultimate aim of using them as high pressure hydraulic <b>flow-control</b> <b>valves</b> for agri­cultural applications. A closed helical coil spring, when pressurized, will provide a controlled flow between the coils when extended or later­ally deflected a given distance. Tests revealed severe longitudinal oscillations when operating in the extension mode, resulting in a very low fatigue life. The lateral deflection mode did not exhibit these oscillations but did exhibit a surge phenomenon at higher pressures. A four-way closed center spring valve was built using four exter­nally pressurized springs operating in the lateral deflection mode. A unique cable actuation system provided good proportional control with minimum deadzone and tolerancing. Tests showed that performance was acceptable up to approximately 1, 000 psi but surges at higher pressures deteriorated performance. As {{a result of this}} study it is concluded that spring valves have applications at moderate pressures but operation at higher pressures is not practical...|$|R
40|$|In many {{control system}} {{applications}} Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) {{plays an important}} role to measure the displacement. The performance of the control system depends on the performance of the sensing element. It is observed that the LVDT exhibits the same nonlinear input-output characteristics. Due to such nonlinearities direct digital readout is not possible. As a result we employ the LVDTs only in the linear region of their characteristics. In other words their usable range gets restricted due to the presence of nonlinearity. If the LVDT is used for full range of its nonlinear characteristics, accuracy of measurement is severely affected. So, to reduce this nonlinearities different ANN techniques is being used such as single neuron structure, MLP structure, RBFNN and ANFIS structure. Another problem considered here is with flow measurement. Generally flow measurements uses conventional flow meters for feedback on the flow-control loop cause pressure drop in the flow and in turn lead to the usage of more energy for pumping the fluid. An alternative approach for determining the flow rate without flow meters is thought. The restriction characteristics of the <b>flow-control</b> <b>valve</b> are captured by a neural network (NN) model. The relationship between the flow rate and the physical properties of the flow as well as <b>flow-control</b> <b>valve,</b> that is, pressure drop, pressure, temperature, and <b>flow-control</b> <b>valve</b> coefficient (valve position) is found. With these accessible properties, the NN model yields the flow rate of fluid across the <b>flow-control</b> <b>valve,</b> which acts as a flow meter. The viability of the methodology proposed is illustrated by real flow measurements of water flow which is widely used in hydraulic systems. Control of fluid flow is essential in process-control plants. The signal of flow measured using the flow meter is compared with the signal of the desired flow by the controller. The controller output accordingly adjusts the opening/closing actuator of the <b>flow-control</b> <b>valve</b> {{in order to maintain the}} actual flow close to the desired flow. Typically, flow meters of comparatively low cost such as turbine-type flow meters and venturi-type meters are used to measure the volumetric quantity of fluid flow in unit time in a flow process. However, the flow i meter inevitably induces a pressure drop in the flow. In turn, this results in the use of more energy for pumping the fluid. To avoid this problem, non-contact flow meters, i. e. electromagnetic-type flow meters, have been developed and are widely used in process plants not only because there is no requirement for installation in the pipeline but also because introduction to the differential pressure across pipelines is not necessitated. Unfortunately, the cost of such non-contact measurement is comparatively much higher than that of its conventional counterparts. Here, an alternative approach is proposed to obtain the fluid flow measurement for flow-control valves without the pressure drop and the consequent power loss that appear in conventional flow meters. Without the flow meter, it is a fact that the flow rate can be determined from the characteristics of the control valve for flow measurements. In this method, the restriction characteristics of the control valve embedded in a neural network (NN) model are used in determining the flow rate instead of actual measurement using a conventional flow meter. i...|$|E

The two most promising concepts are: a Variable Stream Control Engine and a Variable Cycle Engine with a rear <b>flow-control</b> <b>valve.</b> Each concept utilizes variable components and separate burners to provide independent temperature and velocity control for two coannular flow streams. Unique fuel control techniques are combined with cycle characteristics that provide low fuel consumption, similar to a turbojet engine, for supersonic operation.

40|$|Abstract — Soft {{pneumatic}} actuators provide many exciting properties, but controlling them {{without the use}} of bulky and expensive <b>flow-control</b> <b>valves</b> can be difficult and computa-tionally expensive. We seek a solution to this problem by introducing an inexpensive and reliable muscle-like linear soft actuator used antagonistically to operate a rigid 1 -DoF joint, resulting in a system that combines the advantages of rigid and soft robotics. Using this setup, we performed precise motion control using a sliding mode feedback controller as well as a sliding mode controller augmented by a feedforward term to modulate the state of solenoid valves that drive each actuator. We found that both controllers performed equivalently well in following a step function and in responding to a disturbance. The feedforward augmented controller performed significantly better when following dynamic trajectories over a range of frequencies and with the addition of an external force. The next step will be to modify our valve control scheme to allow for the determination of both the position and stiffness of the joint, better leveraging the advantages of soft {{pneumatic actuators}}.

Microfiche. xxvi, 196 leaves, bound 29 cmA wave-driven {{artificial}} upwelling device, {{consisting of}} a floating buoy, an inner water chamber, a long tail pipe, and two <b>flow-controlling</b> <b>valves,</b> was developed for this research. Hydrodynamic performance of the device to pump up nutrient rich deep ocean water is evaluated by mathematical modeling analysis and hydraulic laboratory experiments. The mathematical model of the device {{is made up of}} four simultaneous differential equations. The first three equations, which describe the motion of upwelled water inside the device, were formulated based on momentum and mass conservation principles. The fourth equation is the equation of motion of the device in ambient waves. The model is solved numerically by the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The equation of motion of the device in ambient waves contains several parameters, including added mass,damping coefficient, wave exciting force and restoring coefficient. Values of these parameters must be determined before the model equations can be solved. In order to determine these variables, a hydrodynamic problem of wave-device interactions must be solved. The boundary element method is used to solve this hydrodynamic problem of radiation and diffraction. Modeling results are verified by a series of hydraulic experiments conducted in a wave basin in the James K. K. Look Laboratory of Oceanographic Engineering at the University of Hawaii. Comparing analytical and experimental results yields some useful information concerning hydrodynamic coefficients under waves of large amplitude. The mathematical model developed in this study was then used to evaluate the effects of five configuration variables on the rate of upwelling flow at the design wave conditions, and to establish design criteria...|$|R

40|$|In this research, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{algorithm}} for {{simulation of}} complex unsteady flows around moving bodies using an unstructured overset or Chimera grid method is presented. A highly automated three-dimensional tetrahedral unstructured overset grid method is developed to model moving parts of arbitrary geometries. Internal flows in industrial flow-control moving valves, such as butterfly valves, moving piston (regarded {{as a kind}} of <b>flow-control</b> <b>valve)</b> of internal combustion engine, etc., are targeted as the main applications of the research. “Choked” flows, complex system of expansion and shock waves developed downstream of valves and transonic, supersonic flows {{in the vicinity of the}} valve-disk and downstream, turbulent and jet flows in an internal combustion (IC) engine with piston movement have been predicted. Unsteady simulations of the nature of the fluid motion within the cylinder of a piston engine have been performed and compared with experiments. The developed overset-grid method, which has been validated with numerical examples such as a supersonic ramp of oblique shock, a transonic converging-diverging duct and an unsteady case of NACA 0012 quasi- 3 D airfoil with pitching oscillations, can equally be applicable to other types of flows with relative motions, for instance, store-separation problem. The newly developed overset grid algorithm has been integrated into a computer program named SunFlo 3 D, developed at the IUPUI Computational Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, which is a general-purpose three-dimensional CFD code for compressible internal and external flows with features such as finite volume method, implicit-time scheme, Sparlat-Allmaras one-equation turbulence model, and viscous and inviscid flow options. The automated overset grid movements are performed for unsteady flow simulations for continuously moving body parts in the flow domains, which may be rotating or moving back and forth regularly. We have demonstrated the automated mesh cutting and donor cell searching capabilities of the overset grid method. Mesh refinement and conservation studies performed showed the accuracy and efficiency of the developed method. Validations with experimental data for steady and unsteady flows around rigid bodies with relative motions are conducted. ...|$|E
