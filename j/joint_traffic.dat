Five Iraqi National Guard soldiers and four U.S. soldiers, including Sgt Collier and his section chief, SSG Potts, maneuvered between the village and the Tigris River to find the shooter. Sgt Collier was accompanying the fire team when the section came under significant direct fire contact. Sgt Collier waited his turn as the Soldiers conducted buddy team maneuvers around a berm that was pro¬viding cover and concealment for the team. During this maneuver, SSG Christopher Potts, Collier’s section leader, was wounded and pinned down. Sgt Collier handed his M4 to another Soldier instructed him to get his aid bag and left the protection pro¬vided by the berm to provide immediate first aid to SSG Potts.

40|$|We study random band {{matrices}} {{within the}} framework of traffic probability, an operadic non-commutative probability theory introduced by Male based on graph operations. As a starting point, we revisit the familiar case of the permutation invariant Wigner matrices and compare the situation to the general case in the absence of this invariance.

We then show how the traffic space of Wigner matrices completely realizes the traffic central limit theorem.

50|$|The Government of Hungary’s {{anti-human}} trafficking {{law enforcement}} efforts improved during the reporting period. Hungary prohibits {{all forms of}} trafficking through Paragraph 175/b of its criminal code, though prosecutors rely on other trafficking-related statutes to prosecute most trafficking cases. During the reporting period, the government amended Paragraph 175/b to increase penalties for cases involving child victims {{under the age of}} 12. Penalties prescribed in Paragraph 175/b now range from one year up to life imprisonment, which are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Authorities note that because of a ruling by the Hungarian Supreme Court, prosecutors must meet strict evidentiary requirements for proving the crime of human trafficking under Paragraph 175/b, specifically that the prosecutor must prove that a victim of human trafficking is either bought or sold by another person; because of this standard, prosecutors generally use other statues to prosecute trafficking offenders. Police and border guards conducted 27 trafficking investigations, compared with 21 investigations in 2008. Authorities prosecuted 16 traffickers in 2009, compared with 18 in 2008. Convictions were obtained against 23 sex trafficking offenders in 2009, compared with 16 sex trafficking and two labor trafficking convictions in 2008. During the last year, the government did not report any prosecutions or convictions for labor trafficking offenses. In 2009, twenty of 23 convicted offenders were sentenced to time in prison, an improvement from 2008 when 11 out of 18 convicted offenders were sentenced to time in prison. Of those sentenced to prison in 2009, 12 convicted offenders received sentences of up to three years’ imprisonment, three offenders received sentences ranging from three to four years’ imprisonment, and five offenders received sentences of five years’ imprisonment. During the reporting period, 55 law enforcement officials received victim sensitivity training and victim identification training.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study load {{balancing}} in wireless mesh networks when the MAC {{layer of the}} network is modelled by STDMA. We formulate the linear problem for <b>joint</b> optimization of <b>traffic</b> allocation and transmission schedule. Both unconstrained path set, allowing arbitrary routing, and predefined paths are considered. In our numerical examples roughly third of the load of the most congested link can be reduced by load balancing.

40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a traffic {{management}} mechanism to support real-time flows in highly unpredictable sensor network environments. The mechanism {{is based on}} a <b>joint</b> <b>traffic</b> regulation and end-to-end scheduling approach; a traffic regulation component adjusts the incoming packet rate to implicitly control the channel load and intelligently rejects packets that are more likely to miss their deadline while a laxity–based scheduling component projects the packets ’ per-hop delay and compensates for network endto-end delays. Thus, high success ratios without severely degrading the fidelity are achieved. Our mechanism attempts to maintain accuracy in a resource–efficient manner even under extremely unstable network conditions where delays are difficult to model and compute. Furthermore, the adoption of a component–based approach allows for substantial independence from both the MAC and routing layers. We thoroughly evaluate our mechanism and demonstrate its accuracy and performance merits. ...|$|E

In this paper, a new decision-making algorithm based on <b>joint</b> <b>traffic</b> and propagation metrics is proposed for HetNets that can reduce the number of unnecessary handovers in comparison with the traditional handover algorithms especially when the femtocell assignment probability is relatively high. We further analyze the handover probability for the proposed scheme which is in a close agreement with simulation results. Simulation results show that a higher assignment probability to femtocell BS is achieved in the proposed algorithm.

40|$|Applications {{running in}} modern data centers {{interact}} with the underlying network in complex ways, forcing administrators to continuously monitor and tune the system.

This paper proposes the HONE architecture for <b>joint</b> HOst-NEtwork <b>traffic</b> management. Rather than design one specific management solution, HONE is a programmable platform that lowers the barrier for deploying new techniques. The programmer specifies measurement queries (using an SQL-like syntax), analysis operations (using functional streaming operators), and control actions. The HONE run-time system automatically partitions queries and analysis across multiple host agents, with queries running against virtual tables that are materialized lazily. A controller combines the results for further analysis and reconfigures the hosts and switches accordingly.
