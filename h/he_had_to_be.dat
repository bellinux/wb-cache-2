5|$|Johnson {{was lost}} to the Rangers early in the 1928–29 season when he {{suffered}} a broken ankle during a December game against the Maroons. A couple days after his injury, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rescued when a fire threatened the Montreal hospital he was convalescing at. Johnson missed virtually the entire regular season with the injury, but returned {{in time for the}} 1929 playoffs, and was credited with improving the Rangers' play as they reached the final against the Boston Bruins.|$|E

Similar to Abu Hanifa and Malik, he developed a tertiary source of legislation. The Shafi'i school adopted istidlal or inference, a process of seeking guidance from the source. Inference allowed the jurists to avoid strict analogy in a case where no clear precedent could be found. In this case, public interest was distinguished {{as a basis for}} legislation.|$|E
5|$|The Count of Artois did {{not join}} the court-in-exile in Hartwell, preferring to {{continue}} his frivolous life in London. Louis's friend the Count of Avaray left Hartwell for Madeira in 1809, and died there in 1811. Louis replaced Avaray with the Comte de Blacas as his principal political advisor. Queen Marie Joséphine died on 13 November 1810. That same winter, Louis suffered a particularly severe case of gout, which was a recurring problem for him at Hartwell, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> put in a wheelchair.|$|E

5|$|Theobald {{called a}} church council at London in June 1160, which dealt partly {{with the issues}} of the papal schism; his health was poor and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken to the council in a litter. A further cause of {{distress}} to Theobald was what he saw as the ingratitude of Becket, who did not visit the ailing archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{had long}} been neglectful of his health and diet, smoking heavily, and rarely exercising. His heavy {{drinking}} had charmed the reporters in Philadelphia in 1940, but by 1944 it was becoming a problem. In August 1944, Willkie felt weak while traveling by train to his Rushville home. There, he suffered a heart attack, but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> persuaded {{to see a doctor}} and he refused to be admitted to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|At over 80, Mondragón {{was still}} able to mount on horseback, though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> helped by two men and could only wear light armour. He first came to {{prominence}} at the Battle of Mühlberg, in 1547, {{and was one of the}} few Spanish officers of good fame in the rebel provinces, being portrayed in a positive light by contemporaneous Dutch authors such as Hugo Grotius and Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft. Mondragón planned not only to relieve Groenlo, but also to lure Maurice into a pitched battle. The Dutch general, however, on receiving news of his enemy's march, set fire to supplies, tools and ammunitions gathered for the siege and retreated two miles out of Groenlo. Mondragón could therefore ressuply the town unmolested.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands of pounds were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, bunding was installed, warning signs were put up and security patrols took place. However, large sections of the fencing were stolen and the warning signs were ignored. Ultimately this led to one man being trapped on the site for five hours on 22May 1997. He had been looking for scrap metal and power cables, and had climbed through a small hole into an underground room, from which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rescued by fire crews. The site was then designated a danger zone. The derelict site was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the sub-station, creating a fire and damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, Moran {{introduced}} {{a bill that would}} restrict broadcast advertisements for erectile dysfunction or male enhancement medication. He said that such ads were indecent and should be prohibited on radio and television between the hours of 6am and 10pm, in accordance with Federal Communications Commission policy. Later that year, Moran and former presidential candidate and former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean held a town hall meeting on the issue of health care at South Lakes High School in Reston, Virginia. The meeting was interrupted several times by protesters, most notably pro-life activist Randall Terry, who, along with about half a dozen supporters, caused such a commotion that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> escorted out by police. The incident was replayed several times {{over the next few weeks}} on television as an example of the tension at town halls that fall.|$|E
5|$|In late April all the factions {{except the}} Flying Squadron had disappeared, and the {{cardinals}} {{had agreed to}} elect Emilio Altieri. On 29 April 1670 Altieri received three votes at the scrutiny in the morning, which was the same number he had received consistently {{since the beginning of}} the conclave. At the afternoon scrutiny, he received twenty-one votes, and was shortly acclaimed pope by an additional thirty-five cardinals. This brought his final total to fifty-six out of a total possible of fifty-nine electors. Altieri was old and was in poor health, and resisted his own election to the point where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dragged out of his room by two cardinals in order to be acclaimed. His election took place at 3 pm, but he resisted being elected for an hour. He took the name Clement in honour of Clement IX, who had created him a cardinal. At the age of 79, Altieri is the oldest person to have been elected pope.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years, British {{officials}} depended on native officials for advice {{and to act}} as interpreters. However, {{they had to be}} careful about ethnic rivalries. Thus Fadl el-Mula, a Dinka who had been a police quartermaster, greatly impressed the Governor of Mongalla and was appointed assistant superintendent of the Twic Dinka in 1909. He was credited with keeping the peace between the Dinka and the Nuer people, two groups with a history of fighting and cattle raiding. However, Fadl el-Mula was so strongly biased towards the Dinka that his police were attacked by angry Nuer and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> removed from his post.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a local {{businessman}} named Louis Edwards began accruing {{shares in}} Manchester United and was eventually made chairman on Hardman's death in 1965. His son, Martin Edwards, purchased {{a percentage of}} shares from Alan Gibson – son of former owner James Gibson – and became the majority shareholder and chairman when Louis Edwards died in 1980. During Martin Edwards' time as chairman, Manchester United {{was the subject of}} several takeover bids; the first came from media tycoon Robert Maxwell, who bid £10million in February 1984, but the sale fell through before any serious talks could take place. In 1989, property magnate Michael Knighton {{was on the verge of}} completing a £20million takeover, but his financial backers pulled out at the last minute and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> content with merely a seat on the board.|$|E
5|$|Philipp's mother, {{who never}} married, was the eighth child of {{relatively}} poor parents. Her father {{made a living}} as a driver and as a laborer in the construction business. The financial situation was always tight, and taught everyone in the family discipline and to work hard to survive. To support the family, Alma worked as an accountant and clerk. Philipp's father paid a monthly alimony of 35 Reichsmark (RM) until 1933. Initially <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reminded by his mother of his obligations. Philipp was baptized on 29 July 1917, taking the name Johannes Fritz, and was confirmed in 1931.|$|E

5|$|The 2005–06 {{season was}} a disappointing {{one for the}} Rockets, as McGrady {{appeared}} in only 47 games due to injury. At various points during the year, he missed time due to back spasms, including a moment in January where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carried off the court in a stretcher due to a severe flare up. Despite his health concerns, McGrady was able to play in that year's All-Star Game {{in front of his}} home crowd in Houston, exploding for 36 points in just 27 minutes. For the season, he averaged 24.4 points and 6.5 rebounds per game. Due in part to his frequent absences, the Rockets failed to qualify for the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The same day, Bottomley {{wrote to}} Smith, {{saying that he}} and Wilson were disheartened {{by the lack of}} {{progress}} regarding both independence and the Lisbon appointment. He was willing to visit Rhodesia personally, but could not come until October because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in Blackpool to attend the Labour Party Conference, due to commence on 26 September. The next morning, on 8 September, Johnston told Smith that if Reedman proceeded to Portugal in open disregard for Britain's wishes, it would negatively affect future independence negotiations. Rhodesia's delay in justifying the appointment was also having a detrimental affect, Johnston asserted. Finally, he threatened to evict the Rhodesian envoys from Washington, Bonn and Tokyo if Rhodesia did not desist. Smith was yet again unmoved. Any procrastination regarding Lisbon was Britain's fault, he insisted. He told Johnston to wait for the afternoon session in Rhodesia's Legislative Assembly to hear Dupont's official announcement of Reedman's appointment, as well as the full Rhodesian explanation behind it.|$|E
5|$|Tommy Docherty was {{appointed}} manager in 1971 {{and had a}} brief, but successful, time in charge. Docherty lost only three of his 12 matches as manager, but he left the job in late 1972 to become manager of Manchester United. Despite losing 5–0 to England in his first match in charge, Scotland qualified for the 1974 World Cup under the management of Willie Ormond. Scotland performed creditably at the finals, winning against Zaire and drawing against Brazil and Yugoslavia, but were eliminated on goal difference. Ormond suffered from player indiscipline during his tenure, which included an infamous incident where Jimmy Johnstone, after a night out drinking, sat in a rowing boat that was drifting out to sea. Two teammates attempted to rescue Johnstone, but eventually <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> retrieved by local fishermen. Ormond left the Scotland job in 1977 to become manager of Hearts.|$|E

In reality, Li Yuan was considering a rebellion at least {{by the time of}} his appointment to Taiyuan in early 617. In mid-617, Li began raising additional troops from his province and executed his two deputies—who were appointed by Yang to watch over him. He also concluded an alliance with Shibi, the powerful khagan of the Eastern Turks, which secured his northern frontier from a Turkish invasion and provided him with men and, most importantly, horses, which he lacked. Initially, however, Li Yuan portrayed himself a Sui loyalist, and proclaimed his intention of placing Yang's grandson, Yang You, on the throne.|$|E

In order to distract him from the Ruspanti, Violante Beatrice threw banquets, to which she invited the foremost members of Tuscan society. The Grand Duke's behaviour, vomiting, belching and cracking rude jokes, literally sent the guests scrambling to leave. The Electress was more fortunate for her part. She succeeded in making Gian Gastone appear on Saint John the Baptist's day, 1729. However, during the ceremony, the Grand Duke became so intoxicated that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dragged back to his palace, the Pitti, on a litter.|$|E
