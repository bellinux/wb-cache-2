50|$|A {{taxpayer}} may group assets {{together into}} a general asset account. The grouped assets must have the same life, method of depreciation, convention, additional first year <b>depreciation</b> <b>percentage,</b> and year (or quarter or month) placed in service. Listed property or vehicles cannot be grouped with other assets. Depreciation for the account is computed as if the entire account were a single asset.|$|E
50|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} difference in the rate of change in prices at home and abroad—{{the difference in the}} inflation rates—is equal to the <b>percentage</b> <b>depreciation</b> or appreciation of the exchange rate.|$|R
30|$|Results {{from the}} {{external}} food market (Table  5) indicate {{that in the}} long run, a one <b>percentage</b> <b>depreciation</b> of the nominal exchange rate results into a 1.6  % increase in the food price index, and a one percent increase in international cereal price index leads to a 0.2 increase in the food price index. Thus international pass-through from international food prices is weaker. In addition, the error correction term indicates that 4  % of all deviations from equilbirum in the current month are corrected in the following month.|$|R
50|$|There is no widely {{accepted}} {{definition of a}} currency crisis, also called a devaluation crisis, is normally considered {{as part of a}} financial crisis. Kaminsky et al. (1998), for instance, define currency crises as occurring when a weighted average of monthly <b>percentage</b> <b>depreciations</b> in the exchange rate and monthly percentage declines in exchange reserves exceeds its mean by more than three standard deviations. Frankel and Rose (1996) define a currency crisis as a nominal depreciation of a currency of at least 25% but it is also defined as at least a 10% increase in the rate of depreciation. In general, a currency crisis can be defined as a situation when the participants in an exchange market come to recognize that a pegged exchange rate is about to fail, causing speculation against the peg that hastens the failure and forces a devaluation.|$|R

50|$|Most {{income tax}} systems allow a tax {{deduction}} for recovery {{of the cost of}} assets used in a business or for the production of income. Such deductions are allowed for individuals and companies. Where the assets are consumed currently, the cost may be deducted currently as an expense or treated as part of cost of goods sold. The cost of assets not currently consumed generally must be deferred and recovered over time, such as through depreciation. Some systems permit full deduction of the cost, at least in part, in the year the assets are acquired. Other systems allow depreciation expense over some life using some <b>depreciation</b> method or <b>percentage.</b> Rules vary highly by country, and may vary within a country based on type of asset or type of taxpayer. Many systems that specify depreciation lives and methods for financial reporting require the same lives and methods be used for tax purposes. Most tax systems provide different rules for real property (buildings, etc.) and personal property (equipment, etc.).|$|R
40|$|Total {{investment}} {{costs for the}} wineries in this study ranged from $ 560, 894 for the 2, 000 case winery to $ 2, 339, 108 for the 20, 000 case winery. Building and land costs account for {{the largest percentage of}} total {{investment costs}} for all wineries. Cooperage accounts for the second largest percentage of total investment cost. The highest percent of variable costs for each winery are packaging costs. Full time labor, cooperage, and purchasing of grapes are the next highest operating costs by <b>percentage.</b> <b>Depreciation</b> of capital assets makes up the highest percentage of fixed costs. Economies of size exist at a decreasing rate among all of the wineries. That is, as the output of the winery increases, the per unit costs of production decline. Average total costs per case decrease from $ 154. 41 for the 2, 000 case winery to $ 124. 93 for the 20, 000 case winery. The wineries in this study all have the ability to produce positive cash flows by year three, showing that all operating costs and debt obligations can be met. Results show that all wineries have the ability to repay all debt obligations and to operate as selfsustainin...|$|R
40|$|A common {{feature of}} {{numerous}} studies on early warning systems (EWS) of currency crisis {{is the use}} of an index of exchange market pressure, defined as a weighted average of the rate of <b>depreciation,</b> the monthly <b>percentage</b> changes in international reserves, and sometimes the inclusion of the monthly change in the interest rate, in order to identify and proxy the occurrence of currency crisis. Crucial to this approach is the appropriate definition of a currency crisis, and the literature has usually defined currency crisis occurring when the measure of exchange market pressure exceeds a certain threshold. The main theme of the paper is that not only {{is the use of}} a threshold in defining currency crisis as arbitrary, but a much more careful examination of the basic statistical distribution of the measures of exchange market pressure will reveal that the conventional method of defining currency crisis is statistically flawed or inaccurate in capturing the 'true' dispersion of any given exchange market pressure series. This study applies an alternative statistical method known as Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) to three different weighting schemes popularly adopted in the literature in constructing exchange market pressure indexes, namely the Eichengreen-Rose-Wyplosz (ERW), the Sachs-Tornell-Velasco (STV) and the Kaminsky-Lizondo-Reinhart (KLR). The application of EVA leads to more incidences of currency crises being identified or 'captured' compared to the conventional method across a number of countries in East Asia and Latin America from 1985 to 2003 Extreme Value Theory, Currency Crises, Exchange Market Pressure, East Asia, Latin America...|$|R
