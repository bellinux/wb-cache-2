2500|$|Prior to {{recording}} the What's Going On album, Gaye recorded {{a cover of}} the song, [...] "Abraham, Martin & John", which became a UK hit in 1970. Only a handful of artists of various genres had recorded albums that focused on social commentary, including Curtis Mayfield. Despite some politically conscious material recorded by The Temptations in the late 1960s, Motown artists were often told to not delve into political and social commentary, fearing alienation from pop audiences. Early in his career, Gaye was affected by social {{events such as the}} 1965 Watts riots and once asked himself, [...] "with the world exploding around me, <b>how</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to keep singing love songs?"

40|$|When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{studying}} composition we {{had many}} subjects and techniques to learn about, {{and we needed}} to apply them under different circumstances to create music. At that point, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> always wondering, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to create music? <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to use all of this information? One day, during my composition lesson, I asked my very old and classically formed teacher these questions, to <b>be</b> honest <b>I</b> <b>was</b> expecting some kind of technical oriented answer, but he surprised me saying something like: ??ou know? Composing {{is the same as}} improvising, but you write it down?? That thought has been in my mind ever since, and it has helped me realize that musical creativity can be exercised in multiple ways? When I started to get familiar with the study of traditional music I saw that creativity was not an issue that gathered much attention. Instead, it was the concept of variation what <b>I</b> felt <b>was</b> regarded as more adequate to name changes in the constituent musical parameters of a tune. Furthermore, I saw that the efforts were put mostly in conservation of the musical material, rather than in the creation of new items for it. The concept of having an array of tunes that are related to each other became an issue that deeply took my attention. <b>I</b> thought it <b>was</b> a rather sophisticated way of displaying creativity, {{not only because of the}} production of different musical pieces, but also because of the ability to maintain a level of constancy that supported the idea of them being related. I thought it would be an exiting experience to try and elaborate a creative experience pointed in that direction? Departing from the hypothesis that the process of aurally transmitting a tune to an individual would produce difference between the structure of the model tune and its reproduction. And trying to utilize the characteristics and potentialities that individual musicians have, as a musical filter, where the pitch and rhythm differences between the input musical data and the output musical data could be considered as new traits. I commenced the process of elaborating a method to somehow utilize these variations in order to create different versions of the same tune...|$|R

5000|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} if he felt [...] "lucky" [...] to have written the song, Lake responded:I did write “Lucky Man” when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 12. My mum bought me a guitar and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very lucky in that sense, the answer was yes instead of no. There was the first bit of luck because had the answer been no, my life would have probably <b>been</b> totally different. <b>I</b> got the guitar and I learned the first four chords that were D, G, A Minor and E Minor and with those chords I wrote “Lucky Man”. I truly cannot remember everything about writing it other than I think {{it struck me as}} being a sort of minstrel type of event with these chords, G, D, E Minor and A Minor, gave me this sort of minstrel feeling. “Lucky Man” has kind of an almost medieval element tone to it. It is like a medieval folk song in a way. That was the essence of the idea. I wrote the song in its entirety and I finished it and I remembered it. As far as its significance regarding me and <b>how</b> lucky <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> it does really. You cannot disassociate the tune, the song has been very lucky for me. It came about because of a piece of good fortune, which was my mother giving me the guitar and it has been lucky for me ever since. I would say if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to <b>be</b> honest, <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> very lucky in life. <b>I</b> certainly have <b>been.</b>|$|R

It {{was so good}} to hear your voice again, hon. It’s only been four days, {{but it seems like}} four years since I saw you last. Gee whiz, I can’t understand it—I took physics, geometry, 2 ̆ 6 trig in school, and all practical theories say that a minute is a minute, an hour an hour, a week a week, but why are they so different on Saturdays and Sundays? Maybe you {{have something to do with}} it. I guess you’re that certain little corollary that is the exception to every rule. Ah yes, my little corollary;—romantic ain’t it? Gosh I love you. There goes that song, “It could happen to you,” sounds like Gravel Gertie singing it, but it’s still nice. I don’t know why it reminds me of you, we must have heard it somewhere. It was that weekend we went to the Rodeo, the 21 st the night you told me you loved me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> riding back to the Field in a taxi when I heard it, and immediately I thought of you, (for a change). Speaking of that, we were having a squadron meeting today at the flight line, and there <b>was</b> <b>I,</b> listening to the major’s every word, gapin’ out the window like a lovesick dove. Noticing <b>how</b> engrossed <b>I</b> <b>was</b> (in you) he gently asks me what the hell <b>am</b> <b>I</b> thinking about. “The weather, sir. ” “Oh the weather, well Mr. Clark, maybe you can tell me what the visibility is. ” “Visibility? Oh the visibility—about six miles. ” (Hmm, that name again) <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to know there was a fog outside, <b>I</b> thought it <b>was</b> me, I’m in a fog all the time lately. Very embarassing [sic]. Woman, you’re drivin’ me crazy! But I love you, I guess. I’m glad you told your father, Dottie. I’ll have to talk to him sometime. One of these “man-to-man” jobs, you know? Maybe I can change his mind for him. Well hon, it’s quarter of ten. I’ve got to go now. Give my best to your family. I’ll see you the day after tomorrow, it sounds shorter when you say it that way. I love you and miss you darling. As everJudd[Transcription ends...|$|R

60|$|A miserable man <b>am</b> <b>I,</b> cries the poet; for Orlando, {{beyond a}} doubt, died in Roncesvalles; and die {{therefore}} he must in my verses. Altogether impossible {{is it to}} save him. I thought to make a pleasant ending of this my poem, so {{that it should be}} happier somehow, throughout, than melancholy; but though Gan will die at last, Orlando must die before him, and that makes a tragedy of all. I had a doubt whether, consistently with the truth, I could give the reader even that sorry satisfaction; for {{at the beginning of the}} dreadful battle, Orlando's cousin, Rinaldo, who is said to have joined it before it was over, and there, as well as afterwards, to have avenged his death, was far away from the seat of slaughter, in Egypt; and <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> to <b>suppose</b> that he could arrive soon enough in the valleys of the Pyrenees? But an angel upon earth shewed me the secret, even Angelo Poliziano, the glory of his age and country. He informed me how Arnauld, the Provençal poet, had written of this very matter, and brought the Paladin from Egypt to France by means of the wonderful skill in occult science possessed by his cousin Malagigi--a wonder to the ignorant, but not so marvellous to those who know that all the creation is full of wonders, and who have different modes of relating the same events. By and by, a great many things will be done in the world, of which we have no conception now, and people will be inclined to believe them works of the devil, when, in fact, they will be very good works, and contribute to angelical effects, whether the devil be forced to have a hand in them or not; for evil itself can work only in subordination to good. So listen when the astonishment comes, and reflect and think the best. Meantime, we must speak of another and more truly devilish astonishment, and of the pangs of mortal flesh and blood.|$|R

You see I have no allowances to make--you see <b>how</b> far <b>I</b> <b>am</b> from <b>supposing</b> you could show me any neglect.
