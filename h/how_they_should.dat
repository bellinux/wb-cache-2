5|$|Fifty-eight {{cardinals}} {{were present}} on 9 October when the conclave began. Since Charles II was dying at this time, Spain's cardinal electors were unsure of <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> vote, {{and they did}} not work closely with electors that were loyal to the Holy Roman Emperor. From the beginning, {{it was clear that the}} impending death of Charles II was likely to cause a lengthy conclave, because the next pope would be expected to respond to the anticipated political crisis in Spain following Charles' imminent death.|$|E

Dean was apprehensive about delegating the decision on <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be used to MacArthur, who lacked expert technical knowledge of the weapons and their effects. The Joint Chiefs were not entirely comfortable about giving them to MacArthur either, for fear that he might prematurely carry out his orders.

5|$|In early April 1951, the Joint Chiefs became {{alarmed by}} the build up of Soviet forces in the Far East, {{particularly}} bombers and submarines. On 5 April 1951, they drafted orders for MacArthur authorizing attacks on Manchuria and the Shantung Peninsula if the Chinese launched airstrikes against his forces originating from there. The next day Truman met with {{the chairman of the}} United States Atomic Energy Commission, Gordon Dean, and arranged for the transfer of nine Mark 4 nuclear bombs to military control.

The Joint Chiefs were not entirely comfortable about giving them to MacArthur either, for fear that he might prematurely carry out his orders. Instead, they decided that the nuclear strike force would report to the Strategic Air Command (SAC). This time the bombers deployed with the fissile cores. SAC did not intend to attack air bases and depots; the bombers would target industrial cities in North Korea and China. Deployments of SAC bombers to Guam continued {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Real {{schoolchildren}} participated {{throughout the}} movie's filming. Khan credited {{them with the}} film's success, and was reportedly very popular with them. Furthermore, Khan placed a high priority on the day-to-day needs of his child actors, and {{went to great lengths}} to attend to them. The production staff made sure that the students were never idle, and always kept them occupied outside of filming. New Era Faculty Coordinator Douglas Lee thought the experience not only helped the children to learn patience and cooperation, but also gave them a better understanding of <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> behave towards children like Ishaan who have problems in school. Because filming at New Era High School occurred during the winter holiday, those portraying Ishaan's classmates gave up their vacation to participate. To fill out the campus background, students from nearby schools were also brought in. A total of 1,500children were used for wide-shots of the film's art-fair climax; medium shots only required 400students.|$|E
5|$|A {{training}} establishment for parachute troops {{was set up}} at RAF Ringway, near Manchester, on 21 June 1940 and named the Central Landing Establishment, and the initial 500 volunteers began training for airborne operations. A number of gliders were being designed and constructed by the Royal Air Force, which had also provided a number of Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bombers for conversion into transport aircraft. Organizational plans were also being laid down, with the War Office calling for two parachute brigades to be operational by 1943. However, the immediate development of any further airborne formations, {{as well as the}} initial 500 volunteers already training, was hampered by three problems. With the threat of invasion in 1940, many War Office officials and senior British Army officers did not believe that sufficient men could be spared from the effort to the rebuild the Army after the Battle of France to create an effective airborne force; many believed that such a force would only have a nuisance raiding value and would not affect the conflict in any useful way. There were also material problems; all three of the armed services were expanding and rebuilding, particularly the Army, and British industry had not yet been organised to a sufficient war footing to support all three services as well as the fledgling airborne force. Finally, the airborne forces lacked a single, coherent policy, with no clear idea as to <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be organised, or whether they should come under the command of the Army or the RAF; interorganizational rivalry between the War Office and the Air Ministry, in charge of the RAF, was a major factor in delaying the further expansion of British airborne forces.|$|E

5|$|Whilst airport {{development}} in the UK is subject to local planning authority processes, the government regards airports as {{an important part of}} the national infrastructure and which therefore requires their development to be planned with a strategic approach. To support this, the government began a three-year public consultation process with the publication in December 2000 of The Future of Aviation consultation document. This outlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views on <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be addressed in any future policy. One of the main questions asked was whether policy should focus on meeting demand or whether it should focus instead on limiting the negative effects of air transport. Another key issue for which views were sought was how the industry might best meet the environmental costs it incurs. Between July 2002 and February 2003 a further seven regional consultation documents were published. These focussed on the economic, environmental, social and airspace appraisals relating to options for future airport development specific to the regions, and together they generated half a million responses. During the Spring of 2003 workshops based on a consultation document titled Aviation and the Environment - Using Economic Instruments were held to seek stakeholder views on the desirability and effectiveness of various financial measures that might address the environmental impacts of aviation. The consultation process ended in December 2003 with the publication of The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the government's conclusions.|$|E

25|$|The book of Esther is {{traditionally}} read by Jews on the holiday of Purim from a handwritten scroll on parchment {{that must be}} halakhically valid.

Despite this—or {{perhaps because of the}} large numbers of scrolls of Esther that have been written, and the special attention that has therefore been paid to the problem by rabbis and scribes—manuscripts of Esther and opinions about <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> be written betray a relatively large number of discrepancies regarding the parashah divisions.|$|E
