50|$|Compact utility {{tractors}} require special, smaller implements than full-sized agricultural tractors. Very common implements {{include the}} box blade, the <b>grader</b> <b>blade,</b> the landscape rake, the {{post hole digger}} (or post hole auger), the rotary cutter (slasher or a brush hog), a mid- or rear-mount finish mower, a broadcast seeder, a subsoiler and the rototiller (rotary tiller). In northern climates, a rear-mounted snow blower is very common; some smaller CUT models are available with front-mounted snow blowers powered by mid-PTO shafts. Implement brands outnumbere tractor brands, so CUT owners have {{a wide selection of}} implements.|$|E
50|$|Early graders {{were drawn}} by people and draft animals. The era of {{motorization}} by traction engines, steam tractors, motor trucks, and tractors saw such towed graders grow {{in size and}} productivity. The first self-propelled grader was made in 1920 by the Russell Grader Manufacturing Company, which called it the Russell Motor Hi-Way Patrol. These early graders were created by adding the <b>grader</b> <b>blade</b> as an attachment to a generalist tractor unit. After purchasing the company in 1928, Caterpillar went on to truly integrate the tractor and grader into one design—at the same time replacing crawler tracks with wheels to yield the first rubber-tire self-propelled grader, the Caterpillar Auto Patrol, released in 1931.|$|E
40|$|During this {{reporting}} period, work {{continued on}} development of formulations using the materials identified as contenders for the fibrous monolith wear resistant components. The FM structures fabricated were: diamond/WC-Co, B{sub 4 }C/WC-Co, TiB{sub 2 }/WC-Co, WC-Co/Co, WC-Co/WC-Co. Results of our consolidation densification studies on these systems {{lead to the}} down-selection of WC-Co/WC-Co, WC-Co/Co and diamond/WC-Co for further development for mining applications including drill bit inserts, roof bit inserts, radial tools conical tools and wear plates (WC-Co based system only) for earth moving equipment. Prototype component fabrication focused on the fabrication of WC-Co/WC-Co FM conical tools, diamond/WC-Co coated drill bit insert prototypes. Fabrication of WC-Co/WC-Co FM insert prototypes for a <b>grader</b> <b>blade</b> is also underway. ACR plans to initiate field-testing of the drill bit insert prototypes and the <b>grader</b> <b>blade</b> insert this summer (2002). The first WC-Co/WC-Co FM conical tool prototypes were sent to Kennametal for evaluation {{towards the end of}} the current reporting period...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Conventionally steels {{have enjoyed}} some kind {{monopoly}} in automotive and earthmoving applications like ripper tips and <b>grader</b> <b>blades.</b> The limitation of steels {{is that it}} is difficult to get a good combination of properties. Recent research efforts have focussed on austempered ductile iron as an alternative material which exhibits good properties. Before the usage of ADI can flourish, there is a need to thoroughly understand its mechanical and tribological behaviours. In the present Investigation successful attempts were made to subject ductile iron castings (conforming to IS 400 / 15 - C 3. 65 %, Si 2. 75 %, Mn 0. 35 max, P 0. 03 max, S 0. 015 max, Mg 0. 03 %min) to austempering heat treatment cycle to bring about the changes in the structure and hence the properties. Austempering variables studied were austenisation temperature 900 oC for 2 hours duration, austempering temperature selected were 320 oC and 400 oC,austemperin...|$|R
40|$|Graders {{are used}} for ground grading or levelling. The desired profile is {{achieved}} by passing the machine over the ground surface with appropriately positioned <b>grader</b> <b>blade.</b> Grading errors are caused mainly by vertical displacements of grader front wheels. These displacements, despite a considerable wheel base of the grader, are transferred through the frame onto the grade blade. Moreover the quality of surface levelling is also influenced by the compliancies of the ground, the chassis and the blade suspension system. In the paper a blade stabilization system is proposed. The blade adjustment system with hydraulically driven mechanism is controlled using position signals from the selected points of the machine. ...|$|E
40|$|Machine Guidance is used {{regularly}} in construction of roads to aid performance of heavy machinery such as Graders. Machine Guidance technology {{has the ability}} to tell the grader operator what height he is cutting to compared to the road design and even control the height of the Graders Blade if required. This research project analyses the accuracy of a Machine Guided Grader that is used in the formation of roads we use every day. The author demonstrates the accuracy by comparing heights recorded from the grader to heights surveyed in the field. For ease of use and convenience a Trimble Guided Grader is studied with the most up to date grader control system. The Trimble Guided Grader is supported by a Trimble SPS 930 total station achieving 1 ” of error in the Vertical and Horizontal circles. Teaming up of both these systems gives the best opportunity for accurate results whilst eliminating the likelihood of bias creeping in. Modern Trimble Guided Grader technology {{has the ability to}} record the finished surface constructed through a simple push of a button. This surface can then be used in quality and production reports replacing the need for a surveyor to manually survey the area every time. Field Tests were carried out using this surface to compare against what is surveyed off the range pole producing a set of differences between the two approaches. Two field tests were carried out with results showing an average difference of 0. 3 mm in one test and 3. 9 mm in the second giving the author confidence to conclude that the accuracy generated from a machine guided <b>grader</b> <b>blade</b> was demonstrated to within 4 mm of the actual surveyed surface. The 4 mm accuracy demonstrated that opportunities do exist in using the recorded surface as a formal document at times replacing the conformance report that is used for quality assurance purposes. The vision of this occurring would only be achieved through education and research that demonstrated the accuracy to clients like the Department of Transport and Main Roads. ...|$|E
40|$|Saskatchewan Department of Highways and Transportation (SDHT) is {{responsible}} for maintaining approximately 6500 kilometers of northern gravel surfaced roads. Many of these northern gravel roads are built on poorly graded sand subgrades and may contain protruding bedrock and/or large boulders. Because of this, washboarding, protruding rocks, rutting and potholes are common performance problems of many northern gravel roads. Routine blading of these roads is often ineffective because unstable sand does not maintain its shape and compaction, protruding bedrock and boulders damage motor <b>grader</b> <b>blades,</b> boulders may become dislodged leaving holes in the road, and dislodged boulders are a safety hazard when windrowed along road side-slopes. Clay capping and base stabilization {{have been used to}} provide a stable wearing surface, cover protruding bedrock and large boulders, and reduce traffic dust. However, the long-term performance of clay capping and base stabilization can be highly variable and the associated costs can make these conventional solutions untenable. As a result, SDHT investigated the use of in-place rock crushing and stabilization/modification for northern gravel roads with significant proportion of boulders in the grade using a rotomixer/stabilizer. Based on the findings of this study, in-place rock crushing and stabilization/modification is a technically feasible solution for eliminating protruding bedrock and boulders contained near the surface. However, in-place crushing of boulders with unconfine...|$|R
50|$|The {{road was}} built in four stages {{beginning}} in 1955. In early November, the Gunbarrel Road Construction Party (GRCP) assembled near Coober Pedy in South Australia, half coming from Adelaide together with a bulldozer, and half with a grader from Maralinga, led by Len Beadell. The starting point was Victory Downs homestead just over the border with the Northern Territory, and 24 kilometres west of the Stuart Highway. Work began on 13 November 1955, and continued westward to Mulga Park. An interruption occurred after about 35 km when the <b>grader's</b> <b>blade</b> mounting bolts were snapped after hitting a submerged Mulga tree root. Beadell made a hurried return trip to Alice Springs for parts. The road reached Mulga Park on 2 December, where construction ceased for the year, as the bulldozer's starting pilot motor had failed. Beadell continued ahead on a ground reconnaissance, then on 7 December made an aerial survey which departed from a natural airstrip in the Mount Davies vicinity, and flew towards the Rawlinson Ranges where the future weather station was to be located. With the knowledge gained, Beadell led a ground party of four Land Rovers to the site where a stone cairn was built on 12 December. The site was named Giles after Ernest Giles (the first European to explore the area in 1874). Beadell's Land Rover suffered a broken rear axle during the return towards Mount Davies, so an axle was borrowed {{from one of the}} other vehicles which was left behind to be recovered the following year.|$|R
40|$|The work {{performed}} {{on this program}} was to develop wear resistant, tough FM composite materials with efforts focused on WC-Co based FM systems. The materials were developed for use in mining industry wear applications. Components of interest were drill bit inserts for drilling blast holes. Other component applications investigated included wear plates {{for a variety of}} equipment such as pit shovels, wear surfaces for conveyors, milling media for ball milling operations, hydrocyclone cones, <b>grader</b> <b>blades</b> and dozer teeth. Cross-cutting technologies investigated included hot metal extrusion dies, drill bits for circuit board fabrication, cutting tools for cast iron and aluminum machining. An important part of the work was identification of the standard materials used in drilling applications. A materials trade study to determine those metals and ceramics used for mining applications provided guidance for the most important materials to be investigated. WC-Co and diamond combinations were shown to have the most desirable properties. Other considerations such as fabrication technique and the ability to consolidate shifted the focus away from diamond materials and toward WC-Co. Cooperating partners such as Kennametal and Kyocera assisted with supplies, evaluations of material systems, fabricated parts and suggestions for cross-cutting technology applications for FM architectures. Kennametal provided the raw materials (WC-Co and Al-TiCN powders) for the extent of the material evaluations. Kyocera shared their research into various FM systems and provided laboratory testing of fabricated materials. Field testing provided by partners Superior Rock Bit and Brady Mining and Construction provided insight into the performance of the fabricated materials under actual operational conditions. Additional field testing of cross-cutting technology, the extrusion of hot metals, at Extruded Metals showed the potential for additional market development...|$|R
50|$|Roads were {{provided}} and maintained through a committee formed in 1907 by Local Improvement District 15.B.3 around Hanley. The early challenges were the hilly area and creek to the east. Early prairie roads were trails which became so rutted {{that they could}} barely be crossed over. To make roads out of these trails horse drawn <b>blade</b> <b>graders</b> were used to level out hummocks and fill badger holes. Horse drawn slush scrapers filled in sloughs. More advanced fresno scrapers replaced the slush scrapers as they could make longer and wider swaths across the sloughs. By ploughing the prairie soil at the road allowance, and then using road graders to pull in the dirt roads could be made wide enough for the first cars of the area. The rural municipality of Rosedale No. 283 was incorporated December 13, 1909.|$|R
