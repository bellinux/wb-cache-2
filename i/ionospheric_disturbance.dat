25|$|When the Sun is active, strong solar flares {{can occur}} that {{will hit the}} sunlit side of Earth with hard X-rays. The X-rays will {{penetrate}} to the D-region, releasing electrons that will rapidly increase absorption, causing a high frequency (3–30nbsp&MHz) radio blackout. During this time very low frequency (3–30nbsp&kHz) signals will be reflected by the D layer instead of the E layer, where the increased atmospheric density will usually increase the absorption of the wave and thus dampen it. As soon as the X-rays end, the sudden <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> (SID) or radio black-out ends as the electrons in the D-region recombine rapidly and signal strengths return to normal.|$|E

30|$|Various <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> were {{observed}} after the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake by highresolution GPS-TEC observation in Japan. This paper and accompanying papers (Chen et al., 2011; Maruyama et al., 2011; Matsumura et al., 2011; Saito et al., 2011) report {{all the details}} of the commencement and evolution of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> following this earthquake. The ins and outs of post-seismic <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> were first observed by a high-resolution two-dimensional GPS-TEC observation. The concentric ionospheric wave trains following earthquakes were also observed for the first time. In this paper, we will present an overview of all the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> and clarify the characteristics of the concentric <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> propagating away from the epicenter. Saito et al. (2011) discussed the ionospheric variations {{in the vicinity of the}} epicenter. The long-distance propagation of ionospheric waves are discussed by Chen et al. (2011). Maruyama et al. (2011) discussed the vertical structure of the ionospheric variations based on ionosonde observations. Matsumura et al. (2011) studied the atmospheric waves by numerical simulations.|$|R

50|$|The Dellinger effect, or {{sometimes}} Mögel-Dellinger effect, is {{another name for}} a sudden <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance.</b> The effect was discovered by John Howard Dellinger around 1935 and also described by the German physicist Hans Mögel (1900-1944) in 1930. The fadeouts are characterized by sudden onset and a recovery that takes minutes or hours.|$|E
50|$|A sudden <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> (SID) is an {{abnormally}} high ionization/plasma {{density in}} the D {{region of the}} ionosphere caused by a solar flare. The SID results in a sudden increase in radio-wave absorption that is most severe in the upper medium frequency (MF) and lower high frequency (HF) ranges, {{and as a result}} often interrupts or interferes with telecommunications systems.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> affect Global Positioning System (GPS) {{performance}} {{in terms of}} accuracy and integrity, especially over the equatorial region. During {{the period of the}} disturbances, GPS receivers suffer from a high noise level. Not taken into account by the current stochastic model, the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> degrade GPS positioning accuracy. In addition, non-Gaussian tails are observed in the distribution of the noise during the period of the disturbances; therefore the integrity of GPS can also be affected. This paper develops a statistical solution that is able to mitigate effects of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> on GPS accuracy and integrity using a commercial dual frequency receiver. The Rate of Total Electron Content (TEC) change Index (ROTI), a parameter derived from the dual frequency receiver, is used to group the levels of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances.</b> The standard deviations of the pseudorange noise under different groups are evaluated. By incorporating both the ROTI and the satellite elevation, a modified stochastic model is proposed to reduce the effect of the disturbed observation on the positioning accuracy. The performance of the model is evaluated by a test and an inflated sigma for each group is recommended for over-bounding anomalies of observations to protect the user against threats from <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances.</b> This technique, together with results in this paper, can be applied to mitigate the effects of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> on GPS.

50|$|Short wave {{radio waves}} (in the HF range) are {{absorbed by the}} {{increased}} particles in the low altitude ionosphere causing a complete blackout of radio communications. This is called a short wave fading. These fadeouts last {{for a few minutes}} to a few hours and are most severe in the equatorial regions where the Sun is most directly overhead. The <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> enhances long wave (VLF) radio propagation. SIDs are observed and recorded by monitoring the signal strength of a distant VLF transmitter.A whole array of sub-classes of SIDs exist, detectable by different techniques at various wavelengths: the SPA (Sudden Phase Anomaly), SFD (Sudden Frequency Deviation), SCNA (Sudden Cosmic Noise Absorption), SEA (Sudden Enhancement of Atmospherics), etc.|$|E

50|$|When a {{solar flare}} occurs on the Sun {{a blast of}} intense {{ultraviolet}} and x-ray radiation hits the dayside of the Earth after a propagation time of about 8 minutes. This high energy radiation is absorbed by atmospheric particles, raising them to excited states and knocking electrons free {{in the process of}} photoionization. The low altitude ionospheric layers (D region and E region) immediately increase in density over the entire dayside. The <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> enhances VLF radio propagation. Scientists on the ground can use this enhancement to detect solar flares; by monitoring the signal strength of a distant VLF transmitter, sudden ionospheric disturbances (SIDs) are recorded and indicate when solar flares have taken place.|$|E
5000|$|Victor Gilinsky (former {{member of}} the Nuclear Regulatory Commission) argued that the science panel's {{findings}} were politically motivated. There was some data that seemed to confirm that a nuclear explosion was the source for the [...] "double flash" [...] signal. There was the [...] "anomalous" [...] traveling <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> that was measured at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico at the same time, but many {{thousands of miles away}} in a different hemisphere of the earth. A test in Western Australia conducted a few months later found some increased nuclear radiation levels. A detailed study done by New Zealand's National Radiation Laboratory found no evidence of excess radioactivity, and neither did a U.S. Government-funded nuclear laboratory. Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists who worked on the Vela Hotel program have professed their conviction that the Vela Hotel satellite's detectors worked properly.|$|E
50|$|VLF {{signals are}} often {{monitored}} by radio amateurs using simple homemade VLF radio receivers {{based on personal}} computers (PCs). An aerial {{in the form of}} a coil of insulated wire is connected to the input of the soundcard of the PC (via a jack plug) and placed a few metres away from it. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) software in combination with a sound card allows reception of all frequencies below the Nyquist frequency simultaneously in the form of spectrogrammes. Because CRT monitors are strong sources of noise in the VLF range, it is recommended to record the spectrograms with any PC CRT monitors turned off. These spectrograms show many signals, which may include VLF transmitters and the horizontal electron beam deflection of TV sets. The strength of the signal received can vary with a sudden <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance.</b> These cause the ionization level to increase in the ionosphere producing a rapid change to the amplitude and phase of the received VLF signal.|$|E
30|$|Various {{kinds of}} <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> {{following}} strong earthquakes {{have been studied}} for several decades (e.g., Davies and Baker, 1965). The vertical crustal movement during an earthquake causes the displacement of the atmosphere on the Earth’s surface and excites atmospheric waves which propagate up to the thermosphere. They modulate the ionospheric plasma density through ion-neutral collisions. Two-dimensional ionospheric total electron content (TEC) observations using a dense GPS receiver network have recently been employed to examine <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> induced by earthquakes (Ducic et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2010) and tsunamis (Artru et al., 2005). Heki and Ping (2005) revealed circular TEC structures propagating from the epicenter after earthquakes off the Pacific coast of Japan. Although these previous studies revealed some aspects of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> following earthquakes, {{there has been no}} observation of all the details of post-seismic <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> including their commencement near the epicenter and their evolution in a wider area.|$|R
30|$|It is {{well known}} that the primary {{formation}} mechanisms of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> are due to the variations in the electric fields and in the thermospheric parameters. According to the pioneering work by Mayr and Volland (1973), the middle latitude positive <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbances</b> are formed by the meridional component of the thermospheric wind, and the negative disturbances are due to the thermosphere composition variations.|$|R

40|$|The {{specific}} aim of {{the project}} at hand is to study the changes in amplitude and phase of VLF radio waves {{to see if we}} can detect the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> (the change in electron density) caused by a Gamma-Ray burst. The possible advantages of observing gamma-ray bursts through ionospheric disturbances are better localization of burst directions through a large network of VLF receiving points; measurement of total ionizing fluence of gamma-ray bursts; and comparison with satellite data (GOES and GRO) to derive properties of the ionosphere. There is a major problem here: the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> caused by a Gamma-Ray burst is at best extremely difficult and at worse impossible to detect. So far only one vent has been detected via this method. Therefore, it was decided to study the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> caused by solar flares first with the hope that they will teach us how to detect the elusive Gamma-Ray bursts.

40|$|During {{magnetic}} storms, wind disturbances {{produced by}} auroral phenomena {{can affect the}} whole thermospheric circulation and associated ionospheric dynamo currents for many hours {{after the end of}} the storms. In this paper we define criteria to select a new simple type of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> dynamo events that allow a simple interpretation over all longitude sectors. These events exhibit a weak auroral activity during at least 24 UT hours, on the day after the storm. We analyze the magnetic disturbances “Ddyn” observed at equatorial latitudes in the three longitude sectors of such selected events. It is found for all the cases that the amplitude of the H component of the Earth's magnetic field is reduced, on the day after storm at equatorial latitudes, in agreement with the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>disturbance</b> dynamo model (Blanc and Richmond, 1980).
