5|$|The sparsely haired tail {{is about}} as long as the head and body. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> brown above and lighter below. In contrast, the tail of H.megacephalus has little to no {{difference}} in color between the upper and lower surface. In 2006, Weksler and colleagues noted tail coloration as a difference between the two species of Transandinomys (bicolored in T.talamancae and unicolored in T.bolivaris), but in their 1998 study, Musser and colleagues could not find differences in tail coloration between their Panamanian samples of the two species.|$|E
5|$|The tail appears {{naked and}} is shorter than or {{about as long}} as the head and body; it is longer in T.talamancae. Its {{coloration}} is variable; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> brown above and at the sides and light brown and often white to a greater or smaller extent below, and in some specimens the tail has the same color above and below. The scales on the tail are smaller than in T.talamancae.|$|E
5|$|Plotinus {{argued that}} since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on mankind should depend on their {{position}} {{with respect to the}} zodiac. He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's conjunction with a planet as good when the moon is full, but bad when the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of her surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when the moon is full to us, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dark,</b> and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet.|$|E

5|$|The Malagasy {{mountain}} mouse or Koopman's montane voalavo (Monticolomys koopmani) is a rodent {{within the}} subfamily Nesomyinae {{of the family}} Nesomyidae, and {{is closely related to}} Macrotarsomys. It is monotypic within the genus Monticolomys. It is found in the highlands of eastern Madagascar. A small mouse-like rodent, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> brown on the upperparts and dark gray below. It has small, rounded, densely haired ears and broad feet with well-developed pads. The long tail lacks a tuft at the tip. The skull is delicate and lacks crests and ridges on its roof.|$|E
5|$|The {{coloration}} of the upperparts {{is generally}} uniform, with some scattered darker hairs. There is a yellow {{ring around the}} eyes, which is more prominent than in A.sylvanus. The underparts are not strongly demarcated from the upperparts in color and are yellow-brown to gray. There are some scattered white hairs on the chin. Although this white spot is better developed than in A.sylvanus, A.spegazzinii lacks the conspicuous white spot seen in A.simulator. The color of the feet ranges from white and yellow-brown to gray. Ungual tufts of hairs cover the claws; these hairs are grayish-brown at the bases and whitish at the tips. The amount of hair on the tail is variable, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> brown above and white to yellow-brown below. High-altitude animals tend to have hairier ears and tails.|$|E
5|$|The road jersey from 1995 to 2003, {{which became}} the team's home jersey in 2003 when the NHL decided to switch home and road jerseys, is {{predominantly}} burgundy and dark blue in color. Along the jersey, there are two black and white zigzag lines, one in the shoulders, the other near the belly. Between them, the jersey is burgundy, outside those lines <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> blue. Similar lines exist around the neck. The Avalanche logo is {{in the center of}} the jersey. On top of the shoulders, there is the alternate logo, one on each side. The away jersey is similar but with different colors. The burgundy part on the home jersey is white on the away jersey, the light blue part is burgundy and the black and white lines became gray and blue.|$|E

5|$|Hindfoot {{length is}} 37mm (1.5in). The upper {{sides of the}} feet are covered with grayish white fur, which extends around the claws to form ungual tufts. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is {{relatively}} short at 6mm (0.2in); the hallux (first digit) is 8mm (0.3in) long, and the other digits 11 to 12mm (0.4 to 0.5in). The tail is 238mm (9.4in) long and naked in part. At the base, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> brown both above and below, but slightly lighter below. The upper side remains dark brown for much of its length, though the color does become lighter towards the tip. The lower side becomes mottled at about 55mm (2.2in) from the tip and then whitish at about 65mm (2.6in). It has a well-developed tuft at its tail tip, consisting of whitish and occasional light brown hairs. This tuft commences at about 130mm (5.1in) from the base with fairly short hairs and becomes more pronounced at 180mm (7.1in). In contrast, the greater big-footed mouse has a weaker, dark brown tuft.|$|E
25|$|Dive {{lights are}} {{critical}} safety equipment, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> inside caves. Each diver generally carries a primary light, {{and at least}} one backup light.

25|$|The painted swellshark (Cephaloscyllium pictum) is {{a little-known}} species of catshark, {{belonging}} to the family Scyliorhinidae, found in eastern Indonesia. This species reaches a maximum known length of , and has a thick body with a short, broad and flattened head. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> gray with a variegated pattern of irregular darker and lighter blotches above, and lighter below with gray blotches and speckling on the snout. Like other swellsharks, it can inflate itself as a defensive measure.|$|E

25|$|Zoologist, angler and {{television}} presenter Jeremy Wade investigated the creature in 2013 {{as part of}} the series River Monsters, and concluded that it is a Greenland shark. The Greenland shark, which can reach up to 20 feet in length, inhabits the North Atlantic Ocean around Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, and possibly Scotland. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> in colour, with a small dorsal fin. According to biologist Bruce Wright, the Greenland shark could survive in fresh water (possibly using rivers and lakes to find food) and Loch Ness has an abundance of salmon and other fish.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{who work}} at night and attempt to sleep during the day suffer because {{the timing of the}}ir sleep/wake {{schedule}} remains out of phase with the timing of the environmental light. Night workers are particularly prone to vehicle accidents, and their decreased alertness, performance, and vigilance are likely to blame for a higher rate of industrial accidents and quality control errors on the job, injuries and a general decline in work productivity rate. Recent information also suggests that as the body normally releases melatonin when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dark,</b> working under artificial like at night suppresses the released of melatonin, which may increase the risk of developing cancer.|$|E
25|$|Acrylamide {{has been}} found in roasted barley tea, called mugicha in Japanese. The barley is roasted so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> brown prior to being steeped in hot water. The {{roasting}} process revealed 200–600 micrograms/kg of acrylamide in mugicha. This is less than the >1000 micrograms/kg found in potato crisps and other fried whole potato snack foods cited in the same study and it is unclear {{how much of this is}} ingested after the drink is prepared. Rice cracker and sweet potato levels were lower than in potatoes. Potatoes cooked whole were found to have significantly lower acrylamide levels than the others, suggesting a link between food preparation method and acrylamide levels.|$|E

25|$|Common {{ostriches}} {{have been}} farmed in South Africa {{since the beginning}} of the 19th century. According to Frank G. Carpenter, the English are credited with first taming common ostriches outside Cape Town. Farmers captured baby common ostriches and raised them successfully on their property, and were able to obtain a crop of feathers every seven to eight months instead of killing wild common ostriches for their feathers. It is claimed that common ostriches produce the strongest commercial leather. Common ostrich meat tastes similar to lean beef and is low in fat and cholesterol, as well as high in calcium, protein and iron. Uncooked, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> red or cherry red, a little darker than beef. Ostrich stew is a dish prepared using common ostrich meat.|$|E
25|$|When <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dark,</b> {{they use}} {{echolocation}} calls to forage. During daylight hours, they {{can rely on}} vision to look for prey and intruders. The echolocation in T. mauritianus is unique in that their frequency pulses are emitted in patterns of twos and threes separated by long intervals of silence. This helps observers distinguish the species from other kinds of bats. The bats can adjust the frequency they emit to fit a given situation. For example, the bat can decrease the frequency to less than 20 Hertz to hunt insects that are attuned to bat echolocation, which gives them an advantage and increases their number of potential food sources. They are capable of emitting frequencies more than 25 Hertz, which allows them to hunt in less open habitats. This increases their range of habitats, and allows them to be flexible in their choice of environments.|$|E
25|$|At the {{railroad}} tracks, Chanie {{turns in the}} direction away from the school and toward where he thinks his home will be. When <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>dark,</b> he decides to sleep next to a beaver pond, lighting a small fire with the matches {{given to him by}} the girl. However, the fire gives him little to no protection against the extremely cold temperatures that night. He ends up dreaming about the sexual abuse he experienced at the hands of one of his teachers. Back on the tracks, Chanie continues to slowly make his way on his journey, weakened from exhaustion and exposure. He falls a number of times before finally succumbing to the cold. After his death, a mother lynx lifts Chanie’s spirit and carries him into the forest, away from the tracks. In the morning an engineer comes across Chanie's frozen body by the tracks and notifies the authorities. The story ends with Chanie, warm and happy, dancing in the forest with all of the animals featured throughout the novel.|$|E
