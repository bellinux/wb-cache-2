40|$|An {{ensemble}} of nutrient models was applied in 17 European catchments to analyse the variation that appears after simulation of net nutrient loads and partitioning of nutrient loads at catchment scale. Eight models for N and five models for P were applied in three core catchments covering European-wide gradients in climate, topography, soil types {{and land use}} (Vansjø- Hobøl (Norway), Ouse (Yorkshire, UK) and Enza (Italy)). Moreover, each of the models was applied in 3 - 14 other EUROHARP catchments in order to inter-compare {{the outcome of the}} nutrient load partitioning at a wider European scale. The results of the nutrient load partitioning show a variation in the computed average annual nitrogen and phosphorus loss from agricultural land within the 17 catchments between 19. 1 - 34. 6 kg N ha- 1 and 0. 12 - 1. 67 kg P ha- 1. All the applied nutrient models show that the catchment specific variation (range and standard deviation) in the model results is lowest when simulating the net nutrient load and becomes increasingly higher for simulation of the <b>gross</b> nutrient <b>loss</b> from agricultural land and highest for the simulations of the <b>gross</b> nutrient <b>loss</b> from other diffuse sources in the core catchments. The average coefficient of variation for the model simulations of <b>gross</b> P <b>loss</b> from agricultural land is nearly twice as high (67 %) as for the model simulations of <b>gross</b> N <b>loss</b> from agricultural land (40 %).

40|$|A {{myriad of}} {{downstream}} communities and industries rely on streams fed by both groundwater discharge and glacier meltwater draining the Cordillera Blanca, Northern Peruvian Andes, which contains the highest density of glaciers in the tropics. During the dry season, approximately half the discharge in the region's proglacial streams comes from groundwater. However, {{because of the}} remote and difficult access to the region, there are few field methods that are effective at the reach scale to identify the spatial distribution of groundwater discharge. An energy balance model, Rhodamine WT dye tracing, and high-definition kite-borne imagery {{were used to determine}} gross and net groundwater inputs to a 4 -km reach of the Quilcay River in Huascaran National Park, Peru. The HFLUX computer programme () was used to simulate the Quilcay River's energy balance using stream temperature observations, meteorological measurements, and kite-borne areal photography. Inference from the model indicates 29 % of stream discharge at the reach outlet was contributed by groundwater discharge over the study section. Rhodamine WT dye tracing results, coupled with the energy balance, show that approximately 49 % of stream water is exchanged (no net gain) with the subsurface as <b>gross</b> gains and <b>losses.</b> The results suggest that gross gains from groundwater are largest in a moraine subreach but because of large <b>gross</b> <b>losses,</b> net gains are larger in the meadow subreaches.
