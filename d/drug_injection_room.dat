The project was {{initiated}} by private residents residing in Vesterbro, whose {{aim was to}} eliminate drug use on the street whilst providing addicts with an opportunity get better conditions, and create an easier route to treatment. In the summer of 2012, following the launch of private initiatives, a bill passed legalizing the <b>drug</b> <b>injection</b> <b>room.</b> This project examines {{the impact of the}} <b>drug</b> <b>injection</b> <b>room</b> and explains how it can be presented as an aid for addicts seeking recovery. In addition, the moral and political issues surrounding the <b>drug</b> <b>injection</b> <b>room</b> bill will be ad-dressed. Specifically, it will be discussed if <b>drug</b> <b>injection</b> <b>room</b> is in accordance with UN Narcotic Drug Conventions, whilst possible conflicts with regard to national narcotics legislation will be considered, in addition, the police and the health care staff assigned role will be discussed. Follow-ing this, a discussion will be held as to the justification of legislating with specific regard to a cer-tain societal group. In particular, legislating the right to posses and intake narcotics. This paper draws the conclusion – that regardless of complex grey areas – the drug injection room’s aim is to help a vulnerable group in society to obtain better conditions, and potentially move one step closer to receiving rehabilitative care...|$|E

The complications mainly result from iatrogenic reasons and can occur because of vascular variations in the arteries, under circumstances where normal intravenous injection is difficult, or in drug abusers who perform self-injection. The adverse effect associated with intra-arterial <b>drug</b> <b>injection</b> is serious and may lead to necrosis, requiring amputation of the affected extremity, infection, pseudoaneurysm, rhabdomyolysis, compartment syndrome, and permanent disability. However, the etiology of such adverse effects has not been clearly identified and treatment methods {{have not yet been}} established. We encountered a patient who developed necrosis of the thumb after an inadvertent injection of diclofenac sodium in the radial artery due to variations in the forearm arteries. Here, we report the prevention and treatment of, and precautions against, the dangers of intra-arterial <b>drug</b> <b>injection.</b> Keywords: intra-arterial <b>drug</b> <b>injection,</b> diclofenac sodium, thumb necrosi...|$|R

40|$|Few {{data have}} been {{available}} to examine the longitudinal behavioral changes among <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> users despite the favorable findings of previous studies on reduced risk in <b>drug</b> <b>injection</b> and needle sharing. A substantial number of <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> users may either not change their risk behaviors or may lapse later. This study examined the longitudinal risk patterns of <b>drug</b> <b>injection</b> and patterns of unprotected sexual practice over a 48 -month follow-up period. The main {{purpose of this paper}} was to develop predictive models of initiation and maintenance of safer behaviors and, in particular, to identify factors that predict the maintenance or initiation of safer behavior over time. Four patterns of behavioral changes for both <b>drug</b> <b>injection</b> and sexual practice were defined: Initiation of safer behaviors, consistently unsafe practices, lapse into risky practices, and maintenance of risk reductions. A total of 415 <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> users participated in the Risk Assessment Project in Philadelphia. All participants were assessed every six months using the Risk Assessment Battery and HIV antibody test. Each participant had at least two observation points. Using the logit model with generalized estimating equations method, the author found the following results. The longitudinal patterns of risky sexual practice was significantly associated with the patterns of <b>drug</b> <b>injection.</b> Being Black and unemployed at baseline were significant predictors of initiation of cessation of <b>drug</b> <b>injection.</b> Being Black, being in methadone treatment, and receiving the HIV seropositive result were significant predictors of maintenance of cessation of <b>drug</b> <b>injection.</b> Being female and receiving the HIV seropositive result were significant predictors of initiation of safer sexual practice. Being older, being female, and receiving the HIV seropositive result were significant predictors of maintenance of safer sexual practice. Implications for further interventions are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|This project investigates {{how the new}} segment {{has placed}} the drug addicts in an {{aberrant}} and stigmatized position, and how it has influenced {{the location of the}} <b>injection</b> <b>room</b> and the physical surroundings on Plads til Alle. This study shows that the new segment of residents and the drug addicts use the urban space in different ways. The behaviour of drug addicts in the public space varies from the norm, which places them in a deviated position. Because of the greater contrast between the two segments, the physi- cal characteristics of the drug addicts have been more distinct. This leads to a further stig- matization of the drug addicts. The residents of Inner Vesterbro wish to help the drug addicts and they are in favour of an <b>injection</b> <b>room.</b> However they don’t want the <b>injection</b> <b>room</b> placed too close to their homes, and therefore they have a NIMBY-attitude towards the <b>injection</b> <b>room.</b> This project concludes that, despite the dual nature of Plads til Alle, there are room for both drug addicts and the new segment of residents.

40|$|Abstract—Developing patient {{specific}} {{model for the}} simula-tion of chemotherapy <b>drug</b> <b>injection</b> is important in medical application. This paper proposed a two-phase fluidic method to simulate chemotherapy <b>drug</b> <b>injection</b> and an improved lumped element method to simulate deformation of vessel at real-time by using GPU for general computing. Firstly, a three-dimensional (3 -D) model of hepatic vessels is reconstructed from clinical CT-images using multi-layer method. A 3 -D thinning algorithm based on Valence Driven Spatial Median (VDSM) is applied to generate unit-width skeleton of the vessel tree. The two-phase flow simulation of <b>drug</b> <b>injection</b> is based on Hagen-Poiseuille model by introducing a friction factor using bubbly flow Reynolds number. The improved lumped element method achieves good simulation realism at high computational speed to simulate deformable object. Real-time rendering and inter-action of vessel deformation, self collision, and surface tearing has been realized and demonstrated in a virtual experiment. I...|$|R

Sharing of needles/syringes was more prevalent at the first injection (51. 3 %) than at the baseline interview (36. 8 %). Those who shared syringes/needles at first injection {{were more likely to}} be currently engaged in direct/indirect sharing practices. Among young injectors (< 30 years), those reporting sharing of needles/ syringes at the first injection were about four times more likely to have been infected by HCV. Hepatitis C virus prevalence among active IDUs (n = 272) was 11 %. Prison history and longer duration of <b>drug</b> <b>injection</b> were identified as independent predictors of HCV infection. To effectively curb HCV transmission among IDUs and minimize harms associated with risk behaviors, preventive strategies should target individuals initiating <b>drug</b> <b>injection</b> beginning with their very first injection and discourage the transition from non-injecting use to the self-injection of illicit drugs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{designing}} a feedback control strategy for drug release in treatment of solid tumors. The dynamical model comprises three coupled reaction diffusion equations governing the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumor cells, normal tissues and drug concentration. The control input is {{the rate of}} <b>drug</b> <b>injection.</b> By combining the merits of nonlinear dynamic inversion and variational optimization, a control law has been synthesized. This law ensures that the tumor follows an exponential decay while minimizing the spatial drug concentration in the tumor site. The proposed method exploits {{the structure of the}} cancer dynamics to formulate a hierarchical control strategy. First the drug concentration is taken to be a pseudo-control for the tumor and normal cell dynamics which is then controlled via the rate of <b>drug</b> <b>injection.</b> The <b>drug</b> <b>injection</b> is assumed to be spatially discrete with finitely many temporally varying actuators (catheters).
