It is entirely constructed from Rajasthani pink sandstone and Italian Carrara marble. Based on traditional Hindu architectural guidelines (Shilpa shastras) on maximum temple life span, it makes no use of <b>ferrous</b> <b>metal.</b> Thus, it has no support from steel or concrete.|$|E
5|$|Similar alloys {{with the}} {{addition}} of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which <b>ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> dies would be too expensive. For building facades, roofing, and other applications for sheet metal formed by deep drawing, roll forming, or bending, zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used. Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes.|$|E
5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove and solid particles, {{before it is}} released from the chimney. Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from the filters contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored in a sealed silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning is moved by converyor to a bunker. Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes <b>ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> from the ash for recycling. The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in the construction industry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Bottom ash {{contains}} many ferrous materials (e. g. <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals,</b> Fe 3 O 4, Fe 2 O 3, FeS). In addition, <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> include the heavy metals, as Ni and Cr have a chemical attraction to iron, with Cu used to coat with Ni and Cr metals for polishing or to prevent corrosion. For <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals,</b> {{the formation of}} a Fe 3 O 4 -Fe 2 O 3 double layer (similar to pure Fe) was found during air-annealing in an incinerator (1000 C). A strong thermal shock, such as that which takes place during water-cooling of bottom ash, leads to the breakdown of this oxidation layer, facilitating the degradation of <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> and the formation of corrosion products. Therefore, Fe-ion (heavy metal) oxides can be formed on <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals,</b> and magnetic separation can separate it from bottom ash. Thus, in this study the objection is to investigate the separation ratio of heavy metals by magnetic separation along with the mineralogical formation of Fe-ion (a heavy metal) ...|$|R
50|$|Magnetic imaging devices (e.g. MRIs) {{generate}} enormous magnetic fields, {{and therefore}} rooms intended {{to hold them}} exclude <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals.</b> Bringing objects made of <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> (such as oxygen canisters) into such a room creates a severe safety risk, as those objects may be powerfully thrown about by the intense magnetic fields.|$|R
25|$|Like any {{magnetic}} device, compasses {{are affected}} by nearby ferrous materials, {{as well as by}} strong local electromagnetic forces. Compasses used for wilderness land navigation should not be used in proximity to <b>ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> objects or electromagnetic fields (car electrical systems, automobile engines, steel pitons, etc.) as that can affect their accuracy. Compasses are particularly difficult to use accurately in or near trucks, cars or other mechanized vehicles even when corrected for deviation by the use of built-in magnets or other devices. Large amounts of <b>ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> combined with the on-and-off electrical fields caused by the vehicle's ignition and charging systems generally result in significant compass errors.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} crystal structures, {{notably the}} {{perovskite}} structure, which exhibit ferroelectric behavior. This is analogous to ferromagnetism, in that, {{in the absence of}} an electric field during production, the ferroelectric crystal does not exhibit a polarization. Upon the application of an electric field of sufficient magnitude, the crystal becomes permanently polarized. This polarization can be reversed by a sufficiently large counter-charge, in the same way that a ferromagnet can be reversed. However, although they are called ferroelectrics, the effect is due to the crystal structure (not the presence of a <b>ferrous</b> <b>metal).</b>|$|E

In 2000, DOE estimated that <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> currently in scrap yards within the DOE complex plus <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> expected from dismantling of obsolete facilities will amount to about one million tons. Approximately 60 percent of this metal {{is associated with the}} gaseous diffusion plants at Oak Ridge (K- 25 Site), Portsmouth and Paducah. Decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) is in progress at the K- 25 Site. Based on limited frequency distributions of metal surface assays, estimates are made in this chapter of the incremental quantities of <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> associated with specific surface radioactivity levels. Approximately 78 percent of the 511, 000 tons of <b>ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> from D&D of the diffusion plants would have an activity of less than 4, 400 Bq/kg (120 pCi/g).
