5000|$|Because the Heisenberg Hamiltonian presumes the {{electrons}} {{involved in the}} exchange coupling are localized {{in the context of}} the Heitler-London, or valence bond (VB), theory of chemical bonding, it is an adequate model for explaining the magnetic properties of electrically insulating narrow-band ionic and covalent non-molecular solids where this picture of the bonding is reasonable. Nevertheless, theoretical evaluations of the exchange integral for non-molecular solids that display metallic conductivity in which {{the electrons}} responsible for the ferromagnetism are itinerant (e.g. iron, nickel, and cobalt) have historically been either of the wrong sign or much too small in magnitude to account for the experimentally determined <b>exchange</b> <b>constant</b> (e.g. as estimated from the Curie temperatures via TC ≈ 2⟨J⟩/3kB where ⟨J⟩ is the exchange interaction averaged over all sites). The Heisenberg model thus cannot explain the observed ferromagnetism in these materials. [...] In these cases, a delocalized, or Hund-Mulliken-Bloch (molecular orbital/band) description, for the electron wave functions is more realistic. Accordingly, the Stoner model of ferromagnetism is more applicable. In the Stoner model, the spin-only magnetic moment (in Bohr magnetons) per atom in a ferromagnet is given by the difference between the number of electrons per atom in the majority spin and minority spin states. The Stoner model thus permits non-integral values for the spin-only magnetic moment per atom. However, with ferromagnets [...] (g = 2.0023 ≈ 2) tends to overestimate the total spin-only magnetic moment per atom. For example, a net magnetic moment of 0.54 μB per atom for Nickel metal is predicted by the Stoner model, which is very close to the 0.61 Bohr magnetons calculated based on the metal's observed saturation magnetic induction, its density, and its atomic weight. [...] By contrast, an isolated Ni atom (electron configuration = 3d84s2) in a cubic crystal field will have two unpaired electrons of the same spin (hence, [...] ) and would thus be expected to have in the localized electron model a total spin magnetic moment of [...] (but the measured spin-only magnetic moment along one axis, the physical observable, will be given by [...] ). Generally, valence s and p electrons are best considered delocalized, while 4f electrons are localized and 5f and 3d/4d electrons are intermediate, depending on the particular internuclear distances. [...] In the case of substances where both delocalized and localized electrons contribute to the magnetic properties (e.g. rare-earth systems), the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) model is the currently accepted mechanism.|$|E

As expected, the Mn-concentration strongly affects the magnitude of the <b>exchange</b> <b>constants</b> (especially between Mn as first-nearest-neighbors (NNs) in the cation position). Interestingly, the arrangement of Mn atoms is found to be relevant for the behavior of the second-NN exchange-constant along the [110]-bonding direction, which shows either a strongly ferromagnetic or a marked antiferromagnetic behavior, depending on whether the interaction is mediated by a Ge or by an Mn atom, respectively.
