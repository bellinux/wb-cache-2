5|$|Ahead of the spar, the thick-skinned {{leading edge}} of the wing formed a strong and rigid D-shaped box, which took most of the wing loads. At the time the wing was designed, this D-shaped leading edge was {{intended}} to house steam condensers for the <b>evaporative</b> cooling system intended for the PV-XII. Constant problems with the <b>evaporative</b> system in the Goshawk led to the adoption of a cooling system which used 100% glycol. The radiators were housed in a new radiator-duct designed by Fredrick Meredith of the RAE at Farnborough. This used the cooling air to generate thrust, greatly reducing the net drag produced by the radiators. In turn, the leading-edge structure lost its function as a condenser, but it was later adapted to house integral fuel tanks of various sizes – a feature patented by Vickers-Supermarine in 1938.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} main {{mechanisms}} for cooling {{the air to}} its dew point: adiabatic cooling, conductive cooling, radiational cooling, and <b>evaporative</b> cooling. Adiabatic cooling occurs when air rises and expands. The air can rise due to convection, large-scale atmospheric motions, or a physical barrier such as a mountain (orographic lift). Conductive cooling occurs when the air comes into contact with a colder surface, usually by being blown from one surface to another, for example from a liquid water surface to colder land. Radiational cooling occurs due to the emission of infrared radiation, either by the air or by the surface underneath. <b>Evaporative</b> cooling occurs when moisture {{is added to the}} air through evaporation, which forces the air temperature to cool to its wet-bulb temperature, or until it reaches saturation.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans swim {{well with}} their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub {{the backs of}} their heads on their preen glands to pick up an oily secretion, which they {{transfer}} to their plumage to waterproof it. Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface. They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter – rippling the skin of the throat and pouch with the bill open to promote <b>evaporative</b> cooling. They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks and in shallow water.|$|E
5|$|Proper post-harvest storage {{aimed at}} {{extending}} and ensuring shelf life is best effected by efficient cold chain application. Cold storage is particularly useful for vegetables such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, radish, spinach, potatoes, and tomatoes, the optimum temperature {{depending on the}} type of produce. There are temperature-controlling technologies that do not require the use of electricity such as <b>evaporative</b> cooling. Storage of fruit and vegetables in controlled atmospheres with high levels of carbon dioxide or high oxygen levels can inhibit microbial growth and extend storage life.|$|E
5|$|Water {{is needed}} by many birds {{although}} their mode of excretion {{and lack of}} sweat glands reduces the physiological demands. Some desert birds can obtain their water needs entirely from moisture in their food. They may also have other adaptations such as allowing their body temperature to rise, saving on moisture loss from <b>evaporative</b> cooling or panting. Seabirds can drink seawater and have salt glands inside the head that eliminate excess salt out of the nostrils.|$|E
5|$|Wake lows form due to {{adiabatic}} warming {{in the wake}} of mature squall lines at the back edge of their rain shields, where <b>evaporative</b> cooling is unable to offset warming due to atmospheric subsidence, or downward motion. They can be caused by gravity waves which duct through boundary layers which are deep and cold to the north of a weather front. As with mesoscale high-pressure areas behind a squall line, when new thunderstorm development stops along the squall line, the wake low will weaken as well. Clearing conditions will accompany the wake low, due to the descending warm air mass associated with the feature. Within the United States, these systems have been observed to form in the Mississippi river valley, Southeast, Florida, and Great Plains.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Rolls-Royce started {{planning}} its future aero-engine development programme and realised {{there was a}} need for an engine larger than their 21-litre (1,296cu in) Kestrel which was being used with great success in a number of 1930s aircraft. Consequently, work was started on a new -class design known as the PV-12, with PV standing for Private Venture, 12-cylinder, as the company received no government funding for work on the project. The PV-12 was first run on 15 October 1933 and first flew in a Hawker Hart biplane (serial number K3036) on 21 February 1935. The engine was originally designed to use the <b>evaporative</b> cooling system then in vogue. This proved unreliable and when ethylene glycol from the U.S. became available, the engine was adapted to use a conventional liquid-cooling system. The Hart was subsequently delivered to Rolls-Royce where, as a Merlin testbed, it completed over 100 hours of flying with the Merlin C and E engines.|$|E
5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog can travel far {{in a single}} day or night; {{distances}} of 1.0 to 1.5km have been recorded. Tagging experiments have shown that some can move up to 3km in total, and that some travel several kilometres from the closest breeding habitat. However, the species evidently tends to return to or remain at an identified site, provided the habitat stays appropriate for its needs, or else it will move away. The green and golden bell frog also favours areas with the greatest habitat complexity, and as such, this is a core component of habitat-based strategies to protect the species. In general, the frogs stay within areas of 100–700m2 The frog is well equipped for survival on land. It can rehydrate by absorbing moisture through its ventral skin, and <b>evaporative</b> water loss occurs at a rate, indicative of a watertight skin. very low Some have been observed up to 400m from the nearest body of water.|$|E

25|$|Wax is an <b>evaporative</b> finish {{because it}} is {{dissolved}} in turpentine or petroleum distillates to form a soft paste. After these distillates evaporate, a wax residue is left over.|$|E
25|$|The common ostrich has {{no sweat}} glands, and under heat stress {{they rely on}} panting to reduce their body temperature. Panting {{increases}} <b>evaporative</b> heat (and water) loss from its respiratory surfaces, therefore forcing air and heat removal without the loss of metabolic salts. Panting allows the common ostrich {{to have a very}} effective respiratory <b>evaporative</b> water loss (REWL). Heat dissipated by respiratory evaporation increases linearly with ambient temperature, matching the rate of heat production. As a result of panting the common ostrich should eventually experience alkalosis. However, The CO2 concentration in the blood does not change when hot ambient temperatures are experienced. This effect is caused by a lung surface shunt. The lung is not completely shunted, allowing enough oxygen to fulfill the bird’s metabolic needs. The common ostrich utilizes gular fluttering, rapid rhythmic contraction and relaxation of throat muscles, in a similar way to panting. Both these behaviors allow the ostrich to actively increase the rate of <b>evaporative</b> cooling.|$|E
25|$|Deutz AG {{produced}} two-hundred 4-wheel {{internal combustion}} locomotives with an <b>evaporative</b> {{cooling water jacket}} surrounding the single cylinder oil engine. Fifty similar 6-wheel locomotives were produced by Deutz.|$|E
25|$|A similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a {{multistage}} <b>evaporative</b> cooler. The air {{is passed}} through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again. The brine has to be regenerated, {{and that can be}} done economically with a low temperature solar still. Multiphase <b>evaporative</b> coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50°F (28°C), and still control humidity. If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{positive}} effects trees have on reducing temperatures and <b>evaporative</b> emissions in parking lots, cities like Davis, California, have established parking lot ordinances that mandate 50% canopy cover over paved areas.|$|E
25|$|A {{technology}} {{closely related}} to the solar chimney is the <b>evaporative</b> down-draft cooltower. In areas with a hot, arid climate this approach may contribute to a sustainable way to provide air conditioning for buildings.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} light hydrocarbons, {{butadiene}} leaks {{can be detected}} by the formation of ice balls (from the <b>evaporative</b> freezing of {{water out of the}} atmosphere) even when the temperature is well above 0°C.|$|E
25|$|The Rolls-Royce Goshawk was a {{development}} of the Rolls-Royce Kestrel that used <b>evaporative</b> or steam cooling. In line with Rolls-Royce convention of naming piston engines after birds of prey, it was named after the goshawk.|$|E
25|$|Legionella testing {{typically}} involves collecting {{water samples}} and surface swabs from <b>evaporative</b> cooling basins, shower heads, faucets/taps, and other locations where warm water collects. The samples are then cultured and {{colony forming units}} (cfu) of Legionella are quantified as cfu/Liter.|$|E
25|$|In dry summer weather, the Scugog River {{ceases to}} flow {{out of the}} lake, and its {{tributary}} streams of Mariposa Brook and East Cross Creek flow backward into the lake via the river to offset the high <b>evaporative</b> losses off the lake and marsh surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease {{is caused}} by a {{waterborne}} bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most commonly from <b>evaporative</b> cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly placed or maintained <b>evaporative</b> cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to acquire infection.|$|E
25|$|Along with {{adiabatic}} cooling {{that requires a}} lifting agent, there are three major non-adiabatic mechanisms for lowering {{the temperature of the}} air to its dew point. Conductive, radiational, and <b>evaporative</b> cooling require no lifting mechanism and can cause condensation at surface level resulting in the formation of fog.|$|E
25|$|Three-drum boilers are a {{class of}} {{water-tube}} boiler used to generate steam, typically to power ships. They are compact and of high <b>evaporative</b> power, factors that encourage this use. Other boiler designs may be more efficient, although bulkier, and so the three-drum pattern was rare as a land-based stationary boiler.|$|E
25|$|Water mass {{accounts}} for 68% of body mass in adult common ostriches; this is down from 84% water mass in 35-day-old chicks. The differing degrees of water retention {{are thought to}} be a result of varying body fat mass. In comparison to smaller birds ostriches have a lower <b>evaporative</b> water loss resulting from their small body surface area per unit weight.|$|E
25|$|With cooling towers, a {{hyperbolic}} {{structure is}} preferred. At the bottom, the widening {{of the tower}} provides a large area for installation of fill to promote thin film <b>evaporative</b> cooling of the circulated water. As the water first evaporates and rises, the narrowing effect helps accelerate the laminar flow, and then as it widens out, contact between the heated air and atmospheric air supports turbulent mixing.|$|E
25|$|Phodopus species {{display a}} variety of morphological, {{physiological}} and behavioral adaptations to seasonal temperature extremes and aridity. To survive the exceptional cold of winter, they have evolved spherical, compact bodies with excellent insulation, including both fur and fat. Water is scarce in both summer and winter, and these hamsters have developed an excellent ability to conserve water by maintaining low <b>evaporative</b> water loss rates and concentrating urine.|$|E
25|$|To improve {{tenderness}} of beef, it {{is often}} aged (i.e., stored refrigerated) to allow endogenous proteolytic enzymes to weaken structural and myofibrillar proteins. Wet aging is accomplished using vacuum packaging to reduce spoilage and yield loss. Dry aging involves hanging primals (usually ribs or loins) in humidity-controlled coolers. Outer surfaces dry out and can support growth of molds (and spoilage bacteria, if too humid), resulting in trim and <b>evaporative</b> losses.|$|E
25|$|Another {{trick is}} to cool the {{building}}'s thermal mass at night, and then cool the building from the thermal mass during the day. It helps {{to be able to}} route cold air from a sky-facing radiator (perhaps an air heating solar collector with an alternate purpose) or <b>evaporative</b> cooler directly through the thermal mass. On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky facing radiators can cool below freezing.|$|E
25|$|A {{heat pipe}} {{typically}} {{consists of a}} sealed pipe or tube at both the hot and cold ends. Heat pipes utilize <b>evaporative</b> cooling to transfer thermal energy from one point to another by the evaporation and condensation of a working fluid or coolant. They are fundamentally better at heat conduction over larger distances than heat sinks because their effective thermal conductivity is several orders of magnitude {{greater than that of}} the equivalent solid conductor.|$|E
25|$|The main {{difference}} is that lost-foam casting uses an unbonded sand and full-mold casting uses a bonded sand (or green sand). Because this difference is quite small there is much overlap in the terminology. Non-proprietary terms {{that have been used}} to describe these processes include: cavityless casting, <b>evaporative</b> foam casting, foam vaporization casting, lost pattern casting, the castral process, and expanded polystyrene molding. Proprietary terms included Styro-cast, Foam Cast, Replicast, and Policast.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, due {{to severe}} drought {{across much of}} the Murray Darling Basin Catchment area the Darling River ceased to flow and the Menindee Lakes dried out, Broken Hill {{essentially}} ran out of water, with a muddy sludge coming out of some taps around Christmas time in 2004. The high salt content of the water led to a lot of damage to <b>evaporative</b> air conditioners and rusted out hot water systems at an alarming rate.|$|E
25|$|In a vacuum, {{there is}} no medium for {{removing}} heat from the body by conduction or convection. Loss of heat is by radiation from the 310 K temperature of a person to the 3 K of outer space. This is a slow process, especially in a clothed person, so {{there is no}} danger of immediately freezing. Rapid <b>evaporative</b> cooling of skin moisture in a vacuum may create frost, particularly in the mouth, {{but this is not a}} significant hazard.|$|E
