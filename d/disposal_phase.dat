With regard to the possible determinants of ecological product innovations, regulation appears {{to be one of the}} main drivers of ecological innovation. New technology is the second most important stimulus. An increasing number of firms from different industries have identified the ecological and economic potential which lies in the consumption and waste <b>disposal</b> <b>phases.</b> Nevertheless, eco-efficient products still have to grapple with the problem of weak market performance. Neither eco-labels nor life-cycle analyses appear to be of great significance for innovating firms as they are – especially in the short term- far too costly and time-consuming. On the other hand, instruments which take account of manufacturers? product responsibility appear to have a major impact on ecological product design.

The three different options were as follows: usage and disposal criteria with the existing usage behaviour to reuse and governmental policies to recycle (option 1), usage and disposal criteria as per consumer's perception if systems are in place (option 2) and usage and disposal criteria in case of absence of recycling systems (option 3). The first case, which was the bottom-line for other options, involved {{the study of the}} eco-impact of nonwoven and woven bags in their manufacturing phase, without considering their usage and <b>disposal</b> <b>phases.</b> The LCIA was accomplished by means of the Eco-indicator 99, a damage-oriented method for LCIA in SIMAPRO 7. 2. The single score values calculated by the Eco-indicator 99 were used to compare the environmental impact made by these bags and a detailed explanation of results is provided in this paper. The next stage was the study of the eco-impact of these bags including their usage and <b>disposal</b> <b>phases.</b> This was undertaken with the three different options as stated above and the results derived were compared with the results derived from the baseline case, which was the focus of the study under discussion. The values for usage and end-of-life phases were obtained from the questionnaire survey of different user groups of shopping bags in China, Hong Kong and India. The results show that the eco-impact of nonwoven and woven bags is very high if there are no usage and disposal options provided. When the eco-impact values from options of existing possibilities and consumers' perceptions were compared, {{it was found that the}} eco-impact value was lower in option 1 in all the three territories for both types of bags, which was mainly attributed to the fact for option 1, a higher percentage of reuse was preferred to recycle and landfill categories. The eco-impact of these two types of bags was also studied with and without the presence of recycling systems in China, India and Hong Kong, where the eco-impact was lower due to the presence of recycling systems.

40|$|Carbon {{footprint}} {{has become}} a term often used by the media in recent days. The human carbon footprint is professed {{to be a very}} serious global threat and every nation is looking at the possible options to reduce it since its consequences are alarming. A carbon footprint {{is a measure of the}} impact of human activities on earth and in particular on the environment; more specifically it relates to climate change and to the total amount of greenhouse gases produced, measured in units of carbon dioxide emitted. Effort of individuals in minimizing the carbon footprint is vital to save our planet. This article reports a study of the carbon footprint of various types of shopping bags (plastic, paper, non-woven and woven) using life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) technique in two stages. The first stage (baseline study), comprised the study of the impact of different types of shopping bags in the manufacturing phase, without considering their usage and <b>disposal</b> <b>phases</b> (cradle to gate stage). The LCIA was accomplished by the IPCC 2007 method, developed by the Inter Panel on Climate Change in SIMAPRO 7. 2. The GWP (Global Warming Potential) values calculated by the IPCC 2007 method for 100 years were considered as a directive to compare the carbon footprint made by the different types of shopping bags under consideration. The next stage was the study of the carbon footprint of these bags including their usage and <b>disposal</b> <b>phases</b> (cradle to grave stage) and the results derived were compared with the results derived from the baseline study, which is the major focus of this research work. The values for usage and end-of-life phases were obtained from the survey questionnaire performed amongst different user groups of shopping bags in China, Hong Kong and India. The results show that the impact of different types of shopping bags in terms of their carbon footprint potential is very high if no usage and disposal options were provided. When the carbon footprint values from different disposal options were compared, the carbon footprint values were lower in the case where a higher percentage of reuse is preferred to recycling and disposing to landfill. The results indicate that a higher percentage of reuse could significantly scale down the carbon footprint. Once the shopping bags reached the point where they can no longer be reused, they must be forwarded to recycling options, rather than being disposed to landfill. At this juncture, consumer's perceptions and behaviours in connection with the respective government's policies in promoting & facilitating recycling systems could be critical in reducing the carbon footprint of various shopping bags.

40|$|The <b>disposal</b> <b>phase</b> of the retinal rod outer segment {{renewal process}} has been studied by radioautography in adult frogs {{injected}} with tritiated amino acids. Shortly after injection, newly formed radioactive protein is incorporated into disc membranes which are assembled {{at the base of}} the rod outer segment.

When the labeled membranes reach the end of the outer segment, they are detached from it. They subsequently may be identified in inclusion bodies within the pigment epithelium by virtue of their content of radioactivity. These inclusions have been termed phagosomes. Disc membrane formation is a continuous process, but the detachment of groups of discs occurs intermittently. The detached outer segment fragments become deformed, compacted, undergo chemical changes, and are displaced within the pigment epithelium. Ultimately, the material contained in the phagosomes is eliminated from the cell.

Performance-based specifications allow public authorities to specify their needs in general terms by describing what general functions they require (e. g. lighting, mobility, information management) rather than specifying the minute details of the inputs and process required to get there. The private sector can then innovate and generate savings in resource use and in operating costs. Generally speaking, suppliers are better suited than public procurers to know what options are available in the market, or to innovate and commercialize towards new products and services in order to meet a required performance level. Performance-based specifications are thus a tool with which, under the right conditions, public procurers can stimulate markets to deliver innovative and environmentally sound solutions...|$|R
40|$|Lack of {{efficient}} evaluation {{methods to}} help decision makers in making informed decision regarding in-house technology investments, outsourcing technology, and manual {{activities in the}} remanufacturing industry has raised serious concerns in the selection process of technologies based on company size and resources. This {{has resulted in the}} inability of decision makers to broadly assess the scope of alternative technologies against remanufacturing processes. Thus, it has resulted in the choice of a common solution based on inconsistencies and uncertainties. This paper proposes a holistic framework that can assist decision makers in evaluating the remanufacturing operations by offering better understanding of the performance and potential capabilities in the selection of appropriate technology. The salient feature of the proposed framework is its utilization of the fuzzy logic method as guiding tool to analyze criteria for technology selection in order to make informed decisions on whether to invest or outsource a technology or use labor-intensive operations to the specific process. The paper also highlights importance of the technology assessment framework in aligning and consolidating the dedicated thinking for the life cycle of the particular technology.

This makes the mobile phone the consumer electronic device with the highest replacement rate in history. These parallel and growing trends make sustainability in mobile computing an urgent problem to address.
