50|$|High voltage <b>interface</b> <b>relays,</b> a.k.a., <b>interface</b> relays: or {{coupling}} <b>relays</b> or insulating <b>interfaces</b> is {{a special}} class of electrical relays designed to provide informational and electrical compatibility between functional components isolated {{from each other and}} not allowing for a direct connection due to a high difference of potentials.

5000|$|It is {{agreed that}} the most {{important}} characteristic of opto-electronic systems is their noise robustness and insensitivity to electromagnetic fields. What is not considered, however, is that, in addition to the fiber optic line and the output actuator, such a system includes the source of light pulses on the transmitting side and the amplifier on the receiving side that are generally based on micro-circuitry. It is precisely these elements, with low trigger levels, that get damaged by pulse noise (interference, voltage spikes and discharges) of the high voltage power equipment, which negates the main advantage of opto-electronic systems. Moreover, the optical fibers themselves are subject to a severe negative effect of ionizing radiation and external mechanical impacts (which is critically important in military applications). The arrangement of input and output circuits of such systems needs to be widely spaced (requiring a lengthy optical fiber), which drives up the overall dimensions of interface unit.

40|$|The <b>interface</b> between <b>relay</b> and {{converter}} {{domain of}} muscle myosin {{is critical for}} optimal myosin performance. Using Drosophila melanogaster indirect flight muscle S 1 we performed a kinetic analysis {{of the effect of}} mutations in the converter and relay domain. Introduction of a mutation (R 759 E) in the converter domain inhibits the steady-state ATPase of myosin S 1, whereas an additional mutation in the relay domain (N 509 K) is able to restore the ATPase towards wild-type values. The S 1 -R 759 E construct showed little effect on most steps of the actomyosin ATPase cycle. The exception was a 25 - 30 % reduction in the rate constant of the hydrolysis step, the step coupled to the cross-bridge recovery stroke and involving a change in conformation at the relay/converter domain interface. Significantly the double mutant restored the hydrolysis step to values similar to the wild-type myosin. Modelling the relay/converter interface suggests a possible interaction between converter residue 759 and relay residue 509 in the actin-detached conformation, which is lost in R 759 E but is restored in N 509 K/R 759 E.

40|$|ABSTRACT: L-type {{voltage-gated}} Ca 2 + channels (Cav 1. 2) mediate a {{major part}} of insulin secretion from pancreatic â-cells. Cav 1. 2, like other voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels, is functionally and physically coupled to synaptic proteins. The tight temporal coupling between channel activation and secretion leads to the prediction that rearrangements within the channel can be directly transmitted to the synaptic proteins, subsequently triggering release. La 3 +, which binds to the polyglutamate motif (EEEE) comprising the selectivity filter, is excluded from entry into the cells and has been previously shown to support depolarization-evoked catecholamine release from chromaffin and PC 12 cells. Hence, voltage-dependent trigger of release relies on Ca 2 + ions bound at the EEEE motif and not on cytosolic Ca 2 + elevation. We show that glucose-induced insulin release in rat pancreatic islets and ATP release in INS- 1 E cells are supported by La 3 + in nominally Ca 2 +-free solution. The release is inhibited by nifedipine. Fura 2 imaging of dispersed islet cells exposed to high glucose and La 3 + in Ca 2 +-free solution detected no change in fluorescence; thus, La 3 + is excluded from entry, and Ca 2 + is not significantly released from intracellular stores. La 3 + by interacting extracellularlly with the EEEE motif is sufficient to support glucose-induced insulin secretion. Voltage-driven conformational changes that engage the ion/EEEE <b>interface</b> are <b>relayed</b> to the exocytotic machinery prior to ion influx, allowing for a fast and tightly regulated process of release...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} aim, {{structure}} and language {{use of the}} deconstructive critique of developmental psychology as a specific methodology, i. e. a specific practice of critique. The analysis focuses on the past work {{of a group of}} authors captured under the term “critical psychology of development” (e. g., Morss 1996; Walkerdine 1988; Bradley 1989). The aim is to examine why this valuable critique has apparently failed to effectively engage or unsettle the developmental mainstream. Exploring the efficacy of language use within this critique, it is argued that the “language of deconstruction” inadvertently engenders a semiotic of accusation, that is, a self-perpetuating structure of bizarre anti-theses and accusations. Inspired by the work of Deleuze, Stengers, and Latour the paper aims to disentangle the counter-effective use of language from the relevant critique, in order to revive the critique and illustrate its relevance to practice. The analysis is developed alongside a case example from the author's past experience training as a psychological expert assessing child witnesses for courts in Germany. While examining the issues surrounding psychological knowledge used in legal practice, the analysis reflects on the dilemmas of being an expert practitioner, and a researcher with a background in discursive critical psychology trying to theorise psychological and legal practices critically. Highlighting the inherent volatility of practice operations, it is argued that practice itself could be seen as the <b>interface,</b> or <b>relay,</b> through which critical theorising becomes effective, by operating directly upon or alongside practitioners' already existing awareness of the paradoxes and instabilities of their practice. Engaging directly with such epistemologies of practice could open up wider perspectives toward critical methodologies for social change...|$|R

This can be achieved by integrating the satellite-derived forcing data with hydrological models and landslide algorithms. Progress in using the TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) as input to flood and landslide forecasts is outlined, with a focus on understanding limitations of the rainfall data and impacts of those limitations on flood/landslide analyses. Case studies of both successes and failures will be shown, as well as comparison with ground comparison data sets both in terms of rainfall and in terms of flood/landslide events. In addition to potential uses in real-time, the nearly ten years of TMPA data allow retrospective running of the models to examine variations in extreme events. The flood determination algorithm consists of four major components: 1) multi-satellite precipitation estimation; 2) characterization of land surface including digital elevation from NASA SRTM (Shuttle Radar Terrain Mission), topography-derived hydrologic parameters such as flow direction, flow accumulation, basin, and river network etc.; 3) a hydrological model to infiltrate rainfall and route overland runoff; and 4) an implementation <b>interface</b> to <b>relay</b> the input data to the models and display the flood inundation results to potential users and decision-makers.

In those areas identified as "susceptible" (based on the surface characteristics), landslides are forecast where and when a rainfall intensity/duration threshold is exceeded.
