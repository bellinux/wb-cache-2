40|$|The {{immunological}} synapse (IS) {{serves a}} dual role for sustained T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and for TCR downregulation. TC 21 (Rras 2) is a RRas subfamily GTPase that constitutively associates with the TCR and is implicated in tonic TCR signaling by activating phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase. In this study, we demonstrate that TC 21 both cotranslocates with the TCR to the IS and {{is necessary for}} TCR internalization from the IS through a mechanism dependent on RhoG, a small GTPase previously associated with phagocytosis. Indeed, {{we found that the}} TCR triggers T cells to phagocytose 1 – 6 μm beads through a TC 21 - and RhoG-dependent pathway. We further show that TC 21 and RhoG are necessary for the TCR-promoted uptake of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) from antigen-presenting cells. Therefore, TC 21 and RhoG dependence underlie the existence of a common phagocytic mechanism that drives TCR internalization from the IS together with its peptide-MHC ligand. Spain.

40|$|Although it is {{becoming}} clear that certain miRNAs fulfil {{a fundamental role in}} the regulation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a comprehensive study of the miRNAs associated with this process has yet to be performed. Here, we profiled the signature of miRNA expression in an in vitro model of EMT, ectopically expressing in MDCK cells one of seven EMT transcription factors (SNAI 1, SNAI 2, ZEB 1, ZEB 2, TWIST 1, TWIST 2 or E 47) or the EMT inducer LOXL 2. In this way, we identified a core subset of deregulated miRNAs that were further validated in vivo, studying endometrial carcinosarcoma (ECS), a tumour entity that represents an extreme example of phenotypic plasticity. Moreover, epigenetic silencing through DNA methylation of miRNA genes of the miR- 200 family and miR- 205 that are down-regulated during EMT was evident in both the in vitro (MDCK transfectants) and in vivo (ECS) models of EMT. The strong correlation between expression and DNA methylation suggests a major role for this epigenetic mark in the regulation of the miR- 141 - 200 c locus.

40|$|Cancer and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are {{commonly}} found among elderly patients. Chronic inflammation is the characteristic of both diseases. Amyloid-b peptide {{is the main}} inducer of inflammation in AD. Moreover, chronic inflammation promotes cancer, suggesting that AD patients may be more prone to develop cancer than nondemented people. To test this hypothesis, we injected the carcinogen 20 -methylcholanthrene in the brain of transgenic mice overexpressing the mutant forms of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS 1), {{as a model of}} AD, and their wild-type (WT) littermates. Mutant mice developed tumors faster and with higher incidence than their WT counterparts. Expression of the inflammatory markers interleukin (IL) - 1 a, IL- 1 b, IL- 6, IP- 10 and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) was measured in AD and WT mice of 3 and 12 months of age that had not been exposed to the carcinogen. These cytokines were elevated in older AD mice, indicating the existence of a highly inflammatory milieu in these animals. We also found elevated expression of a mutated form of p 53 in older AD mice, suggesting an alternative mechanism for the predisposition of AD brains to develop brain tumors. Clinical studies reporting comorbidity of AD and brain cancer are needed to understand whether our observations hold true for humans.

40|$|ReportVertebrate limbs develop {{three main}} {{proximodistal}} (PD) segments (upper arm, forearm, and hand) in a proximal-to-distal sequence. Despite extensive research into limb development, whether PD specification occurs through nonautonomous or autonomous mechanisms is not resolved. Heterotopic transplantation of intact and recombinant chicken limb buds identifies signals in the embryo trunk that proximalize distal limb cells {{to generate a}} complete PD axis. In these transplants, retinoic acid induces proximalization, which is counteracted by fibroblast growth factors from the distal limb bud; these related actions suggest that the first limb-bud PD regionalization results from the balance between proximal and distal signals. The plasticity of limb progenitor cell identity in response to diffusible signals provides a unifying view of PD patterning during vertebrate limb development and regeneration.

40|$|Uncertainties in {{calculated}} {{impacts of}} climate forecasts on future regional air quality are investigated using downscaled MM 5 meteorological fields from the NASA GISS and MIT IGSM global models and the CMAQ model in 2050 {{in the continental}} US. Differences between three future scenarios: high-extreme, low-extreme and base case, are used for quantifying effects of climate uncertainty on regional air quality. GISS, with the IPCC A 1 B scenario, {{is used for the}} base case simulations. IGSM results, in the form of probabilistic distributions, are used to perturb the base case climate to provide the high- and low-extreme scenarios. Impacts of the extreme climate scenarios on concentrations of summertime fourth-highest daily maximum 8 -h average ozone are predicted to be up to 10 ppbV (about one-seventh of the current US ozone standard of 75 ppbV) in urban areas of the Northeast, Midwest and Texas due to impacts of meteorological changes, especially temperature and humidity, on the photochemistry of tropospheric ozone formation and increases in biogenic VOC emissions, though the differences in average peak ozone concentrations are about 1 – 2 ppbV on a regional basis. Differences between the extreme and base scenarios in annualized PM 2. 5 levels are very location dependent and predicted to range between − 1. 0 and + 1. 5 μg m− 3. Future annualized PM 2. 5 is less sensitive to the extreme climate scenarios than summertime peak ozone since precipitation scavenging is only slightly affected by the extreme climate scenarios examined. Relative abundances of biogenic VOC and anthropogenic NOx lead to the areas that are most responsive to climate change. Overall, planned controls for decreasing regional ozone and PM 2. 5 levels will continue to be effective in the future under the extreme climate scenarios. However, the impact of climate uncertainties may be substantial in some urban areas and should be included in assessing future regional air quality and emission control requirements. United States.

40|$|Blastic {{plasmacytoid}} {{dendritic cell}} neoplasm (BPDCN) {{is a rare}} subtype of leukemia/lymphoma, whose diagnosis {{can be difficult to}} achieve due to its clinical and biological heterogeneity, as well as its overlapping features with other hematologic malignancies. In this study we investigated whether the association between the maturational stage of tumor cells and the clinico-biological and prognostic features of the disease, based on the analysis of 46 BPDCN cases classified into three maturation-associated subgroups on immunophenotypic grounds. Our results show that blasts from cases with an immature plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) phenotype exhibit an uncommon CD 56 - phenotype, coexisting with CD 34 + non-pDC tumor cells, typically in the absence of extramedullary (e. g. skin) disease at presentation. Conversely, patients with a more mature blast cell phenotype more frequently displayed skin/extramedullary involvement and spread into secondary lymphoid tissues. Despite the dismal outcome, acute lymphoblastic leukemia-type therapy (with central nervous system prophylaxis) and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation appeared to be the only effective therapies. Overall, our findings indicate that the maturational profile of pDC blasts in BPDCN is highly heterogeneous and translates into a wide clinical spectrum -from acute leukemia to mature lymphoma-like behavior-, which may also lead to variable diagnosis and treatment.

40|$|Ferrer-Mayorga, Gemma et al. Cystatin D is an {{inhibitor}} of lysosomal and secreted cysteine proteases. Strikingly, cystatin D {{has been}} found to inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion of colon carcinoma cells indicating tumor suppressor activity that is unrelated to protease inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that a proportion of cystatin D locates within the cell nucleus at specific transcriptionally active chromatin sites. Consistently, transcriptomic analysis show that cystatin D alters gene expression, including that of genes encoding transcription factors such as RUNX 1, RUNX 2, and MEF 2 C in HCT 116 cells. In concordance with transcriptomic data, quantitative proteomic analysis identified 292 proteins differentially expressed in cystatin D-expressing cells involved in cell adhesion, cytoskeleton, and RNA synthesis and processing. Furthermore, using cytokine arrays we found that cystatin D reduces the secretion of several protumor cytokines such as fibroblast growth factor- 4, CX 3 CL 1 /fractalkine, neurotrophin 4 oncostatin-M, pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine/CCL 18, and transforming growth factor B 3. These results support an unanticipated role of cystatin D in the cell nucleus, controlling the transcription of specific genes involved in crucial cellular functions, which may mediate its protective action in colon cancer.

40|$|TrwD, the VirB 11 {{homologue}} in conjugative plasmid R 388, is {{a member}} of the large secretion ATPase superfamily, which includes ATPases from bacterial type II and type IV secretion systems, type IV pilus, and archaeal flagellae assembly. Based on structural studies of the VirB 11 homologues in Helicobacter pylori and Brucella suis and the archaeal type II secretion ATPase GspE, a unified mechanism for the secretion ATPase superfamily has been proposed. Here, we have found that the ATP turnover of TrwD is down-regulated by physiological concentrations of magnesium. This regulation is exerted by increasing the affinity for ADP, hence delaying product release. Circular dichroism and limited proteolysis analysis indicate that magnesium induces conformational changes in the protein that promote a more rigid, but less active, form of the enzyme. The results shown here provide new insights into the catalytic mechanism of the secretion ATPase superfamily. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

40|$|RasGRF family guanine {{nucleotide}} exchange factors (GEFs) promote guanosine diphosphate (GDP) /guanosine triphos-phate (GTP) exchange on several Ras GTPases, including H-Ras and TC 21. Although the mechanisms controlling RasGRF {{function as an}} H-Ras exchange factor are relatively well characterized, {{little is known about}} how TC 21 activation is regulated. Here, we have studied the structural and spatial requirements involved in RasGRF 1 / 2 exchange activity on TC 21. We show that RasGRF GEFs can activate TC 21 in all of its sublocalizations except at the Golgi complex. We also demonstrate that TC 21 susceptibility to activation by RasGRF GEFs depends on its posttranslational modifications: farnesylated TC 21 can be activated by both RasGRF 1 and RasGRF 2, whereas geranylgeranylated TC 21 is unresponsive to RasGRF 2. Importantly, we show that RasGRF GEFs ability to catalyze exchange on farnesylated TC 21 resides in its pleckstrin homology 1 domain, by a mechanism independent of localization and of its ability to associate to membranes. Finally, our data indicate that Cdc 42 -GDP can inhibit TC 21 activation by RasGRF GEFs, demonstrating that Cdc 42 negatively affects the functions of RasGRF GEFs irrespective of the GTPase being targeted.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{the role of}} the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) in epidermal homeostasis. Reduced keratinocyte proliferation is found in interfollicular epidermis of mice lacking the thyroid hormone binding isoforms TRα 1 and TRβ (KO mice). Similar results were obtained in hypothyroid animals, showing the important role of the liganded TRs in epidermal proliferation. In addition, KO and hypothyroid animals display decreased hyperplasia in response to 12 -O-tetradecanolyphorbol- 13 -acetate. Both receptor isoforms play overlapping functional roles in the skin because mice lacking individually TRα 1 or TRβ also present a proliferative defect but not as marked as that found in double KO mice. Defective proliferation in KO mice is associated with reduction of cyclin D 1 expression and up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p 19 and p 27. Paradoxically, ERK and AKT activity and expression of downstream targets, such as AP- 1 components, are increased in KO mice. Increased p 65 /NF-κB and STAT 3 phosphorylation and, as a consequence, augmented expression of chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines is also found in these animals. These results show that thyroid hormones and their receptors are important mediators of skin proliferation and demonstrate that TRs act as endogenous inhibitors of skin inflammation, most likely due to interference with AP- 1, NF-κB, and STAT 3 activation.

Although SAMP 8 mice presented a normal paired-pulse facilitation of the hippocampal CA 1 -medial prefrontal synapse, an input/output curve study revealed smaller field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in response to strong stimulations of the CA 1 -prefrontal pathway.

The aim {{of this study was to}} qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the environmental microbiological quality in a pharmaceutical manufacturing unit of human mesenchymal stem cells production for use in advanced therapies. Two hundred and sixty one points were tested monthly during one year, 156 from air and 105 from surfaces. Among the 6264 samples tested, 231 showed contamination, 76. 6 % for bacteria and 23. 4 % for fungi. Microbial genuses isolated were Staphylococcus (89. 7 %), Microccocus (4. 5 %), Kocuria (3. 2 %) and Bacillus (2. 6. %). In the identification of fungi, three genuses were detected: Aspergillus (56 %), Penicillium (26 %) and Cladosporium (18 %).

40|$|Summary. We study a model-based {{clustering}} {{procedure that}} aims to identify geographic regions with distinctive relationships among ecological and environmental variables. We use a finite mixture model with a distinct linear regression model for each mixture component, relating a measure of environmental quality to multiple regressors. Component-specific values of regression coefficients are allowed, for {{a common set of}} regressors. We implement Bayesian inference jointly for the true partition and component regression parameters. We assume a known, prior classification of measurement locations into “clustering units, ” where measurement locations belong to the same mixture component if they belong to the same clustering unit. A Metropolis algorithm, derived from a well-known Gibbs sampler, is used to sample the posterior distribution. Our approach to the label switching problem relies on constraints on cluster membership, selected based on statistics and graphical displays that do not depend upon cluster indexing. Our approach is applied to data representing streams and rivers in the state of Ohio, equating clustering units to river basins. The results appear to be interpretable given geographic features of possible ecological significance. Acknowledgements: We thank Gene Yagow for assistance in geographic analysis.

40|$|NK cells play a {{key role}} in innate {{elimination}} of virally infected or neoplastic cells but they can be circumvented by immunoevasive mechanisms enabling viral spread or tumor progression. Engagement of the NKG 2 D activating receptor with soluble forms of its ligand is one such mechanism of inducing NK cell hyporesponsiveness. Interestingly, this immunoevasive strategy among others is described at the maternal-fetal interface where tolerance of the semi-allogeneic fetus is required to allow successful human pregnancy. Understanding of maternal-fetal tolerance is increasing but mechanisms preventing alloreactivity of fetal immune cells against the maternal host are less well understood. The study of umbilical cord blood has enabled insight of the fetal immune system, which appears immature and inert. We have found that soluble NKG 2 D ligands (sNKG 2 DLs) are present in cord blood plasma (CBP) and associate with adult NK cell hyporesponsiveness demonstrated by reduced CD 107 a expression and secretion of IFN-γ upon stimulation. The capacity of NK cells to kill K 562 cells or proliferate was also reduced by incubation with CBP; however, physical removal of sNKG 2 DL from CBP restored K 562 lytic function and NKG 2 D expression. Therefore, our results strongly suggest sNKG 2 DLs are expressed in CBP as a mechanism of fetal-maternal tolerance in human pregnancyThe work performed in this study was funded by Anthony Nolan (Charity no. 803716 /SC 038827).

Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare subtype of leukemia/lymphoma, whose diagnosis can be difficult to achieve due to its clinical and biological heterogeneity, as well as its overlapping features with other hematologic malignancies. In this study we investigated whether the association between the maturational stage of tumor cells and the clinico-biological and prognostic features of the disease, based on the analysis of 46 BPDCN cases classified into three maturation-associated subgroups on immunophenotypic grounds. Our results show that blasts from cases with an immature plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) phenotype exhibit an uncommon CD 56 - phenotype, coexisting with CD 34 + non-pDC tumor cells, typically in the absence of extramedullary (e. g. skin) disease at presentation. Conversely, patients with a more mature blast cell phenotype more frequently displayed skin/extramedullary involvement and spread into secondary lymphoid tissues. Despite the dismal outcome, acute lymphoblastic leukemia-type therapy (with central nervous system prophylaxis) and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation appeared to be the only effective therapies. Overall, our findings indicate that the maturational profile of pDC blasts in BPDCN is highly heterogeneous and translates into a wide clinical spectrum -from acute leukemia to mature lymphoma-like behavior-, which may also lead to variable diagnosis and treatment.

40|$|Although {{information}} about the molecular pathogenesis of Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) has significantly advanced, the precise cell of origin and the mechanisms behind WM transformation from immunoglobulin-M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) remain undetermined. Here, we undertook an integrative phenotypic, molecular, and genomic approach to study clonal B cells from newly diagnosed patients with IgM MGUS (n = 22), smoldering (n = 16), and symptomatic WM (n = 11). Through principal component analysis of multidimensional flow cytometry data, we demonstrated highly overlapping phenotypic profiles for clonal B cells from IgM MGUS, smoldering, and symptomatic WM patients. Similarly, virtually no genes were significantly deregulated between fluorescence-activated cell sorter-sorted clonal B cells from the 3 disease groups. Interestingly, the transcriptome of the Waldenström B-cell clone was highly different than that of normal CD 25 - CD 22 + B cells, whereas significantly less genes were differentially expressed and specific WM pathways normalized once the transcriptome of the Waldenström B-cell clone was compared with its normal phenotypic (CD 25 + CD 22 +low) B-cell counterpart. The frequency of specific copy number abnormalities [+ 4, del(6 q 23. 3 - 6 q 25. 3), + 12, and + 18 q 11 - 18 q 23] progressively increased from IgM MGUS and smoldering WM vs symptomatic WM (18 % vs 20 % and 73 %, respectively; P =. 008), suggesting a multistep transformation of clonal B cells that, albeit benign (ie, IgM MGUS and smoldering WM), already harbor the phenotypic and molecular signatures of the malignant Waldenström clone.

40|$|Background/nCharacterizing and {{comparing}} the determinant of cotinine concentrations in different populations should facilitate {{a better understanding}} of smoking patterns and addiction. This study describes and characterizes determinants of salivary cotinine concentration in a sample of Spanish adult daily smoker men and women. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out between March 2004 and December 2005 in a representative sample of 1245 people from the general population of Barcelona, Spain. A standard questionnaire was used to gather information on active tobacco smoking and passive exposure, and a saliva specimen was obtained to determine salivary cotinine concentration. Two hundred and eleven adult smokers (> 16 years old) with complete data were included in the analysis. Determinants of cotinine concentrations were assessed using linear regression models. Results: Salivary cotinine concentration was associated with the reported number of cigarettes smoked in the previous 24 hours (R 2 = 0. 339; p < 0. 05). The inclusion of a quadratic component for number of cigarettes smoked in the regression analyses resulted in an improvement of the fit (R 2 = 0. 386; p < 0. 05). Cotinine concentration differed significantly by sex, with men having higher levels. /nConclusion: This study shows that salivary cotinine concentration is significantly associated with the number of cigarettes smoked and sex, but not with other smoking-related variables.

40|$|The Wnt/β-catenin pathway {{has been}} {{associated}} with thyroid cell growth and tumorigenesis. However, little is known regarding its involvement in the response to the key regulators of thyroid cell proliferation and differentiation. Here we show that TSH and IGF- 1 increase β-catenin nuclear accumulation and its transcriptional activity in differentiated thyroid cells. This effect takes place in a Wnt-independent manner because TSH and IGF- 1, through the activation of protein kinase A and protein kinase B/Akt, phosphorylate β-catenin at S 552 and S 675, which results in β-catenin release from E-cadherin at the adherens junctions. Nuclear β-catenin regulates thyroid cell proliferation, because its silencing or the overexpression of a dominant-negative form of T-cell factor 4 resulted in reduced levels of cyclin D 1 and DNA synthesis. Furthermore, the β-catenin silencing markedly reduced the expression of Pax 8, the main transcription factor involved in epithelial thyroid cell differentiation. Finally, we observed that β-catenin physically interacts with the transcription factor Pax 8, increasing its transcriptional activity on the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) gene, a critical gene required for thyroid cell physiology. Taken together, our findings show that β-catenin plays a not yet described role in thyroid function including a functional interaction with Pax 8. © 2014 by the Endocrine Society.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) to trigger apoptosis preferentially in cancer cells, although sparing normal cells, has motivated clinical development of TRAIL receptor agonists as anti-cancer therapeutics. The molecular mechanisms {{responsible for the}} differential TRAIL sensitivity of normal and cancer cells are, however, poorly understood. Here, we show a novel signalling pathway that activates cytoprotective autophagy in untransformed human epithelial cells treated with TRAIL. TRAIL-induced autophagy is mediated by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) that inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, a potent inhibitor of autophagy. Interestingly, the TRAIL-induced AMPK activation is refractory to the depletion of the two known AMPK-activating kinases, LKB 1 and Ca(2 +) /calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase-β, but depends on transforming growth factor-β-activating kinase 1 (TAK 1) and TAK 1 -binding subunit 2. As TAK 1 and AMPK are ubiquitously expressed kinases activated by numerous cytokines and developmental cues, these data {{are most likely to}} have broad implications for our understanding of cellular control of energy homoeostasis as well as the resistance of untransformed cells against TRAIL-induced apoptosis. © 2009 European Molecular Biology Organization | All Rights Reserved.

In this study, we developed and characterized an intra-arterial cell suspension containing human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) {{for the treatment of}} CLI. Equally, the stability of cells was studied in order to evaluate the optimal conditions of storage that guarantee the viability from cell processing to the administration phase. Effects of various factors, including excipients, storage temperature and time were evaluated to analyze the survival of hMSCs in the finished medicinal product. The viability of hMSCs in different packaging media was studied for 60 h at 4 °C. The best medium to maintain hMSCs viability was then selected to test storage conditions (4, 8, 25 and 37 °C; 60 h). The results showed that at 4 °C the viability was maintained above 80 % for 48 h, at 8 °C decreased slightly, whereas at room temperature and 37 °C decreased drastically. Its biocompatibility was assessed by cell morphology and cell viability assays. During stability study, the stored cells did not show any change in their phenotypic or genotypic characteristics and physicochemical properties remained constant, the ability to differentiate into adipocytes and osteocytes and sterility requirements were also unaltered. Finally, our paper proposes a packing media composed of albumin 20 %, glucose 5 % and Ringer's lactate at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL, which must be stored at 4 °C as the most suitable to maintain cell viability (> 80 %) and without altering their characteristics for more than 48 h. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Vascular Endotelial Growth Factors C and D (VEGF-C and VEGF-D) {{are crucial}} {{regulators}} of lymphangiogenesis, a main {{event in the}} metastatic spread of breast cancer tumors. Although inhibition of lymphangiogenic gene expression might be a useful therapeutic strategy to restrict the progression of cancer, the factors involved in the transcriptional repression of these genes are still unknown. We have previously shown that Nuclear Receptor Corepressor 1 (NCoR) and the thyroid hormone receptor β 1 (TRβ) inhibit tumor invasion. Here we show that these molecules repress VEGF-C and VEGF-D gene transcription in breast cancer cells, reducing lymphatic vessel density and sentinel lymph node invasion in tumor xenografts. The clinical significance of these results is stressed by the finding that NCoR and TRβ transcripts correlate negatively {{with those of the}} lymphangiogenic genes and the lymphatic vessel marker LYVE- 1 in human breast tumors. Our results point to the use of NCoR and TRβ as potential biomarkers for diagnosis or prognosis in breast cancer and suggest that further studies of these molecules as potential targets for anti-lymphangiogenic therapy are warranted.

We have evaluated the clinical and biological events that underlie bone marrow fibrotic changes, as well as its prognostic role, in a well-characterized prospective patient cohort (n= 77) of primary MDS patients. The degree of marrow fibrosis was linked to parameters of erythropoietic failure, marrow cellularity, p 53 protein accumulation, WT 1 gene expression, and serum levels of CXCL 9 and CXCL 10, but not to other covariates including the IPSS-R score. The presence of bone marrow fibrosis grade 2 or higher was associated with the presence of mutations in cohesin complex genes (31. 5 % vs. 5. 4 %, p= 0. 006). By contrast, mutations in CALR, JAK 2, PDGFRA, PDGFRB,and TP 53 were very rare.

40|$|Nuclear {{corepressor}} 1 (NCoR) {{associates with}} nuclear receptors and other transcription factors leading to transcriptional repression. We show here that NCoR depletion enhances cancer cell invasion and increases tumor growth and metastatic potential in nude mice. These changes {{are related to}} repressed transcription of genes associated with increased metastasis and poor prognosis in patients. Strikingly, transient NCoR silencing leads to heterochromatinization and stable silencing of the NCoR gene, suggesting that NCoR loss can be propagated, contributing to tumor progression {{even in the absence}} of NCoR gene mutations. Down-regulation of the thyroid hormone receptor β 1 (TRβ) appears to be associated with cancer onset and progression. We found that expression of TRβ increases NCoR levels and that this induction is essential in mediating inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis by this receptor. Moreover, NCoR is down-regulated in human hepatocarcinomas and in the more aggressive breast cancer tumors, and its expression correlates positively with that of TRβ. These data provide a molecular basis for the anticancer actions of this corepressor and identify NCoR as a potential molecular target for development of novel cancer therapies.

Subopti-mal responses to the available medical and surgical treatments are common in these patients, who also demonstrate limited vascular homeostasis. Neovasculogenesis induced by stem cell therapy could be a useful approach for these patients. Neovasculogenesis and clinical improvement were compared at baseline and at 3 and 12 months after autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell (BMMNC) transplantation in diabetic patients with peripheral artery disease. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial administration of autologous BMMNCs (100 - 400 × 10 6 cells) in 20 diabetic patients with severe below-the-knee arterial ischemia. Although {{the time course of}} clinical effects differed among patients, after 12 months of follow-up all patients presented a notable improvement in the Rutherford-Becker classification, the University of Texas diabetic wound scales, and the Ankle-Brachial Index in the target limb. The clinical outcome was consistent with neovasculogenesis, which was assessed at 3 months by digital subtraction angiography and quantified by MetaMorph software. Unfortunately, local cell therapy in the target limb had no beneficial effect on the high mortality rate in these patients.

40|$|Background Recent {{observations}} point {{towards the}} existence {{of a large number of}} neighborhoods composed of functionally-related gene modules that lie together in the genome. This local component in the distribution of the functionality across chromosomes is probably affecting the own chromosomal architecture by limiting the possibilities in which genes can be arranged and distributed across the genome. As a direct consequence of this fact it is therefore presumable that diseases such as cancer, harboring DNA copy number alterations (CNAs), will have a symptomatology strongly dependent on modules of functionally-related genes rather than on a unique "important" gene. Methods We carried out a systematic analysis of more than 140, 000 observations of CNAs in cancers and searched by enrichments in gene functional modules associated to high frequencies of loss or gains. Results The analysis of CNAs in cancers clearly demonstrates {{the existence of}} a significant pattern of loss of gene modules functionally related to cancer initiation and progression along with the amplification of modules of genes related to unspecific defense against xenobiotics (probably chemotherapeutical agents). With the extension of this analysis to an Array-CGH dataset (glioblastomas) from The Cancer Genome Atlas we demonstrate the validity of this approach to investigate the functional impact of CNAs. Conclusions The presented results indicate promising clinical and therapeutic implications. Our findings also directly point out to the necessity of adopting a function-centric, rather a gene-centric, view in the understanding of phenotypes or diseases harboring CNAs.

40|$|Splicing {{remains an}} incompletely {{understood}} process. Recent {{findings suggest that}} chromatin structure participates in its regulation. Here, we analyze the RNA from subcellular fractions obtained through RNA-seq in the cell line K 562. We show that in the human genome, splicing occurs predominantly during transcription. We introduce the coSI measure, based on RNA-seq reads mapping to exon junctions and borders, to assess the degree of splicing completion around internal exons. We show that, as expected, splicing is almost fully completed in cytosolic polyA+ RNA. In chromatin-associated RNA (which includes the RNA that is being transcribed), for 5. 6 % of exons, {{the removal of the}} surrounding introns is fully completed, compared with 0. 3 % of exons for which no intron-removal has occurred. The remaining exons exist as a mixture of spliced and fewer unspliced molecules, with a median coSI of 0. 75. Thus, most RNAs undergo splicing while being transcribed: "co-transcriptional splicing. " Consistent with co-transcriptional spliceosome assembly and splicing, we have found significant enrichment of spliceosomal snRNAs in chromatin-associated RNA compared with other cellular RNA fractions and other nonspliceosomal snRNAs. CoSI scores decrease along the gene, pointing to a "first transcribed, first spliced" rule, yet more downstream exons carry other characteristics, favoring rapid, co-transcriptional intron removal. Exons with low coSI values, that is, {{in the process of being}} spliced, are enriched with chromatin marks, consistent with a role for chromatin in splicing during transcription. For alternative exons and long noncoding RNAs, splicing tends to occur later, and the latter might remain unspliced in some cases.

40|$|Motivation] Although Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) {{genotype}} a {{very large}} number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the data are often analyzed one SNP at a time. The low predictive power of single SNPs, coupled with the high significance threshold needed to correct for multiple testing, greatly decreases the power of GWAS. [Results] We propose a procedure in which all the SNPs are analyzed in a multiple generalized linear model, and we show its use for extremely high-dimensional datasets. Our method yields P-values for assessing significance of single SNPs or groups of SNPs while controlling for all other SNPs and the family wise error rate (FWER). Thus, our method tests whether or not a SNP carries any additional information about the phenotype beyond that available by all the other SNPs. This rules out spurious correlations between phenotypes and SNPs that can arise from marginal methods because the ‘spuriously correlated’ SNP merely happens to be correlated with the ‘truly causal’ SNP. In addition, the method offers a data driven approach to identifying and refining groups of SNPs that jointly contain informative signals about the phenotype. We demonstrate the value of our method by applying it to the seven diseases analyzed by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC). We show, in particular, that our method is also capable of finding significant SNPs that were not identified in the original WTCCC study, but were replicated in other independent studies. E.
