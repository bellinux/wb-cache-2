2500|$|The {{majority}} of hydrogels {{are attached to}} the fibre, one exception being the fibre optic-based sensor made by Itsubayashi’s group to measure glucose in fish (<b>health</b> <b>indicator),</b> which used a dialysis membrane as the support for the hydrogel. To be more specific, it relied on a GOx oxygen-ruthenium quenching assay where the protein was mixed with AWP (azide-functionalized polyvinyl alchool, a photocrosslinkable polymer) and cross-linked to a dialysis membrane that was rolled around a premade ruthenium oxygen probe (ocean optics) and inserted into an 18-gauge needle with eight holes on the side [...] (akin to a recorder). In such a set-up, the integrity of the protein has no effect on the sensor, unless below a certain concentration. As a consequence, the destruction or inaccessibility of a fraction of the protein is not problematic, which is in contrast to [...] or environmentally sensitive sensing. However, the response speed of this sensor is slow and requires a mathematical prediction to be applied to the measurement.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Regular {{physical}} activity (PA) has associated with various positive health aspects {{such as a}} decreased risk of chronic or generic illnesses, furthermore, a sedentary lifestyle {{has been associated with}} health problems such as obesity. To examine the relationship between patterns of PA, screen-based media use (SBM) and social <b>health</b> <b>indicators</b> within a specific demographic group and highlight the regional vs. national differences in these relationships. Methods. The data is drawn from the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) database, a national cross-sectional survey in a representative sample (N =  3920) of students aged 11 - 13 - 15 years and compared to those of the Tuscan region (N =  3381). Variables considered other than PA and SBM use includes positive <b>health</b> <b>indicators</b> such as physical health status, quality of family and peer relationships, fruit consumption, breakfast consumption as well as negative <b>health</b> <b>indicators,</b> such as <b>health</b> complaints, smoking and alcohol use. Results. Some positive <b>health</b> <b>indicators</b> showed a positive correlation with PA. Students adopting healthy behaviours often met the Physical Activity Guide Line (PAGL). On the contrary, negative <b>health</b> <b>indicators</b> were associated with PAGL in a negative way. In general SBM was positively related to several of the negative <b>health</b> <b>indicators</b> and vice versa. SBM was related in a positive fashion to tobacco use that represents a protective factor. Discussion. The results show that met PAGL is associated with positive <b>health</b> <b>indicators</b> and that high levels of SBM use is associated with negative <b>health</b> <b>indicators.</b> The study also emphasizes the relationship between PA, SBM use and social factors. Increasing PA and decreasing SBM use should be an aim in general health behaviour promotion...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies {{labour force}} {{participation}} of older individuals in 11 European countries. The data {{are drawn from}} the new Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). We examine the value added of objective <b>health</b> <b>indicators</b> in relation to potentially endogenous self-reported health. We approach the endogeneity of self-reported health as an omitted variables problem. In line with {{the literature on the}} reliability of self-reported health ambiguous results are obtained. In some countries self-reported health does a fairly good job and controlling for objective <b>health</b> <b>indicators</b> does not add much to the analysis. In other countries, however, the results show that objective <b>health</b> <b>indicators</b> add significantly to the analysis and that self-reported health is endogenous due to omitted objective <b>health</b> <b>indicators.</b> These latter results illustrate the multi-dimensional nature of health and the need to control for objective <b>health</b> <b>indicators</b> when analysing the relation between health status and labour force participation. This makes an instrumental variables approach to deal with the endogeneity of self-reported health less appropriate. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

Moreover, study also points out a rather diminutive role of public health expenditure in determining the per capita GDP. Health Human Capital; Economic Growth; Cointegration, Error Correction...|$|R
