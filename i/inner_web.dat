Friction barbules support lobe-shaped ("lobular") [...] that are broader than the typical barbicel hosted by other vaned feathers, and which in turn support more [...] The theory is that the augmented surface area and other adaptations significantly increases grip through friction when the outer web of barbs of one primary feather come into contact and rub against the <b>inner</b> <b>web</b> of barbs of another primary feather it overlays, thereby preventing slippage during the rigors of flight. Friction barbules are found only on those parts of primary feathers that are in [...] "zones of overlap" [...] with neighboring primaries. The theory (and the use of [...] "friction" [...] in the title of the defined phrase) has been criticized. In Avian Flight (2005), the author notes that [...] "most birds open and close their wings during every wing beat cycle", and proposes that the energetic cost to overcome friction during the [...] "wing extension and flexion" [...] of each beat cycle would be prohibitive. Offered instead is the theory that the function of these specialized barbules is to lock the primary feathers together on the wings' downstroke, during which high pressure from below the wings' surface would otherwise tend to cause the feathers to spread.|$|E

50|$|Its upperparts {{are green}} and its underparts are white. Unlike other similar {{hummingbirds}} in its range (for example the green-and-white hummingbird), the basal {{half of the}} <b>inner</b> <b>webs</b> of the rectrices are white, but this is typically only visible from below.|$|R
50|$|The South Georgia diving petrel is a small, plump petrel, 180 to(-) 220 mm {{in length}} and {{weighing}} around 90 to(-) 150 g. Its plumage is black above and dull white below, {{and it has a}} stubby black bill with pale blue edges. The wings have thin white strips. The face and neck can be more brown than black. The legs are blue with posterior black lines down the tarsi. Unless seen very close, it is almost indistinguishable from the common diving petrel; the common petrel has brown <b>inner</b> <b>web</b> primary feathers, whereas the South Georgia petrel has light <b>inner</b> <b>web</b> feathering. Common petrels have smaller and narrower bills than the South Georgia petrel, and there are also slight size differences.|$|E
50|$|Young {{birds are}} duller, and can lack a crest while {{moulting}} birds can lack the elongate tail streamers. The racket is {{formed by the}} <b>inner</b> <b>web</b> of the vane but {{appears to be on}} the outer web since the rachis has a twist just above the spatula.|$|E
50|$|In autumn {{and winter}} {{the head and}} mantle are {{distinctly}} buff, as are the underparts, including the throat, but the buff varies in intensity. Except for the central pair, the tail feathers are much whiter than in the northern wheatear, the white on the <b>inner</b> <b>web</b> often extending to the tip.|$|E
50|$|The adult ochre-collared piculet {{is between}} 9 and 10 cm in length. The crown is mainly black with small white spots; the male has a red flecked or solid red fore-crown while the female does not. The nape and {{the sides of}} the neck form a {{cinnamon}} collar. The upper parts of the body are brownish and the flight feathers are chocolate. The tail is mostly black but the <b>inner</b> <b>webs</b> of the central two feathers are white, and the <b>inner</b> <b>webs</b> of the outer four feathers are whitish near the tip. The chin and throat are white with slight barring, and the underparts are white or cream heavily barred with black, especially on the lower belly. The iris is brown, the beak is black and slightly curved and the legs are grey.|$|R
50|$|Short {{straight}} bill, male metallic dusky brown above, dark on {{crown and}} ear-coverts. Area of glittering purple on lower back becoming coppery on rump and green on uppertail coverts.

50|$|The head, neck hackle {{and tail}} of the Lakenvelder are solid black, without spots, ticks or stripes; the <b>inner</b> <b>web</b> of the wing {{primaries}} and secondaries is black. The rest of the bird is white with a pale blue-grey under-colour. The black-and-white pattern {{is similar to the}} colouring of the Lakenvelder breed of cattle, which originated in the same area.|$|E
50|$|The quills are brown, {{except for}} {{near the base}} where they are {{externally}} olive. The secondary quills are olive-brown, duller than the back, and transversely barred with a yellow tinged white. The primaries are externally spotted with yellow, notched on the <b>inner</b> <b>web</b> with white, and the shafts are brown. The tail is olive-brown shaded with an almost green color and crossed with six bars of an almost yellow color. The tips of the feathers are a dull golden, while the shafts are golden brown.|$|E
50|$|The adult male's head {{is black}} {{except for the}} white forehead, patch on lower throat, and white line that runs from behind the eye almost {{enclosing}} ear coverts forming a broken ring. The upperparts and wings are a reddish sandy brown. The primary coverts and alula are grey with white margins. The primaries are grey with chestnut inner webs; all but the outer three are tipped white. The secondaries are grey except for the inner secondaries, which have a chestnut <b>inner</b> <b>web.</b> The iris is dark brown and the bill is black.|$|E
50|$|This {{whistling}} thrush is dark violet {{blue with}} shiny spangling on {{the tips of}} the body feathers other than on the lores, abdomen and under the tail. The wing coverts are a slightly different shade of blue and the median coverts have white spots at their tips. The bill is yellow and stands in contrast. The <b>inner</b> <b>webs</b> of the flight and tail feathers is black. The sexes are similar in plumage.|$|R
50|$|The white-bellied nothura is {{approximately}} 27 cm in length. Its upper parts are light brown and barred black with white streaks. Its throat is white, its foreneck is buff with black streaking, its breast is buff and its belly is white. Its crown is dark brown and {{the sides of}} its head are buff. The legs are bright yellow and the <b>inner</b> <b>webs</b> of its primaries are uniformly dark, unlike in the closely related spotted nothura.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{overlap in}} the {{distribution}} of the green-backed and white-tailed trogons, but the two can be separated by the undertail pattern: Unlike the green-backed trogon, the male white-tailed trogon only has a very narrow black base to each feather (the undertail appears almost entirely white), and the female mainly has black-and-white barring to the <b>inner</b> <b>webs</b> of each feather (can be difficult to see). The male white-tailed trogon also has a bluer rump than the green-backed trogon.|$|R
50|$|A {{male and}} a female are known, which {{resemble}} the immature appearance of the common gadwall except for the black bill with a higher number of fuiltering lamellae, black feet, and the much inferior size (which {{may be due to}} the birds not being fully grown). The male resembles a male common gadwall in eclipse plumage save for some white speckling on the breast and back. The female looks like a small common gadwall female; the primary wing coverts were not patterned black, and the <b>inner</b> <b>web</b> of the secondary remiges was grey instead of white.|$|E
50|$|The rock bush quail is {{very similar}} to and {{overlaps}} in range with the jungle bush quail (Perdicula asiatica). These birds are found in small coveys and are often detected only when they suddenly burst out into flight en masse from under vegetation. It is 6.7 - 7.25 in in length and weighs 2.25 - 3 oz. It is some shade of brown barred and mottled with darker colour. A diagnostic feature is that the outermost primary feather is longer than the innermost, and the <b>inner</b> <b>web</b> of the primaries is barred or speckled with buff. The voice is a trill followed by a series of piping notes which start quiet and grow louder.|$|E

50|$|The drab swiftlet has a satin grayish-blue {{back with}} {{slightly}} glossy crown and tail. The throat {{and the upper}} breast is a mid-gray with a lighter margin to the feathers. The lower breast, flanks and belly are white but the rump is dark. There are dull white spots on the <b>inner</b> <b>webs</b> of the tail feathers. Most birds have a tuft of feathers on the hallux, the rear facing toe. Subspecies perneglecta is darker and has more gloss on the feathers.|$|R
50|$|The weebill (Smicrornis brevirostris) is Australia's {{smallest}} bird {{at approximately}} 8 to 9 cm long. It is an olive-yellow songbird with a grey bill, brown wings, pale yellow eyes and grey feet. Its tail feathers are brown {{with a black}} bar and white spot {{on the tip of}} all <b>inner</b> <b>webs</b> but the central pairs. The sexes are similar. The weebill is the only member of genus Smicrornis; gene flow is strong and local variation follows Bergmann's and Gloger's Rules.|$|R
5000|$|These birds {{range from}} 25 to 28 cm (10-11 in), and are {{primarily}} green, with a maroon patch on the belly, a [...] "scaly" [...] yellow-green-barred breast {{and sides of}} neck, a whitish ear-patch often tinged brown, and a maroon undertail. The specific name frontalis is a reference to its dark maroon frontlet - a feature which separates it from most similar species. The primaries are blue on the outer webs, green on the <b>inner</b> <b>webs,</b> and dark on the tips. The beak is black.|$|R
50|$|Like {{others in}} the genus, it has a broad black ventral line and has no crest. This tit {{is part of a}} {{confusing}} group of species but is distinct in having a grey-back, black hood, white cheek patch and a white wing-bar. The underparts are white with the black central stripe running along the length. The female has a narrower ventral line and is slightly duller. The upper tail coverts are ashy while the tail is black with the central 4 pairs of feathers ashy on the outer webs and all but the central pair are tipped white. The fifth pair is white with a black rachis and a band of black on the <b>inner</b> <b>web.</b> The outermost pair of tail feathers are all white with a black shaft. The undertail coverts are black towards the centre but white on the sides.|$|E
50|$|It {{is a large}} gull at 56 - 68 cm long, with a 137 to 155 cm {{wingspan}} and a {{body mass}} of 680 - 1590 g. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 38.5 to 48 cm, the bill is 4.6 to 6.4 cm and the tarsus is 5.8 to 7.7 cm. The Caspian gull has a long, slender bill, accentuated by the sloping forehead. The legs, wings and neck are longer {{than those of the}} herring gull and yellow-legged gull. The eye is small and often dark, the legs vary from pale pink to a pale yellowish colour. The back and wings are a slightly darker shade of grey than the herring gull but slightly paler than the yellow-legged gull. The outermost primary feather has a large white tip and a white tongue running up the <b>inner</b> <b>web.</b>|$|E

50|$|However, the lores are dark, {{creating}} a dark stripe {{through the eye}} (the stripe does not extend through the eye in mangrove kingfisher), and the underwing, primaries and secondaries are black with white underwing coverts (there is a black carpal patch on the white coverts in mangrove kingfisher). The <b>inner</b> <b>webs</b> of {{the base of the}} flight feathers are white, {{creating a}}n indistinct white wingbar (white completely absent from wings in mangrove kingfisher). The breast is white (tends to be much greyer in mangrove kingfisher). The sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller than adults and have a brown bill.|$|R
50|$|Very {{similar in}} plumage to common {{stonechat}} (Saxicola torquata). The male has black head, white collar and bright rufous chest patch. The back and wings are dark, with white on wing coverts and rump. The key differentiating feature from male common stonechat {{is the white}} <b>inner</b> <b>webs</b> of outer tail feathers which is visible when the bird spreads the tail in flight or while landing. Note that {{this may not be}} visible when the tail is folded. The female is very similar to female common stonechat, but is overall paler with duller rump, tail and wings.|$|R
50|$|This {{medium-sized}} hummingbird {{can measure}} up to 10 cm long, and weigh up to 4.3 g. The male has metallic green upperparts that grade to bronze at the rump and tail. It sports a conspicuous rufous wing patch when the wings are folded. The underwing is mostly rufous-cinnamon. The namesake striped tail is formed by dark bronze green central rectrices and outer rectrices which have black outer <b>webs,</b> white <b>inner</b> <b>webs</b> and broad black tips. The female has a metallic green back but her underparts and {{the sides of her}} face are light brownish grey. On both sexes, the bill is straight and black.|$|R
50|$|The {{populations in}} {{mainland}} India, erythropygia has the rump patch uniform dark chestnut without an dark shaft-streaks. The tail fork is shallow {{and the white}} patch on the <b>inner</b> <b>web</b> of the outer-tail feathers is indistinct. Populations of japonica breed in eastern Asia and winter in Thailand, Burma, India and northern Australia. They are heavily streaked on the underside and have faint streaks on the rump. The populations along the Himalayas nipalensis migrate to peninsular India in winter and breed from Kulu {{in the west to}} Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh in the east. This population has the rump paler with dark shaft streaks. Subspecies rufula of Southern Europe, the Iberian Peninsula east to Baluchistan and Kashmir is resident and winters further south. The chestnut of rump fades to white towards the tail base. The nominate population breeds in Mongolia and Trans-Baikailia wintering in South and Southeast Asia. Subspecies gephyra of inner Mongolia is considered indistinguishable from the nominate subspecies. The African populations include kumboensis from the highlands of Sierra Leone and Cameroon; melanocrissus of the Ethiopian highlands and emini of Sudan, Uganda, Kenya and Zambia. Many of the variations are separable only on tail and wing lengths and these vary with overlap across populations.|$|E
50|$|The Emei leaf warbler {{is a small}} passerine, {{measuring}} 11 - 12 cm in length. Its crown is greyish-green, slightly darker at rear than in front, with a pale median crown-stripe that {{is poorly}} marked in front, and slightly but noticeably broader, paler and more distinct at rear. It has a prominent pale yellowish-tinged supercilium and a distinct dark eye-stripe; the rest of ear-coverts are paler, with faint dark mottling. Its upperparts are dull green, clearly paler than the sides of its crown and eye-stripe. The wings and tail are primarily greenish, with distinct pale yellowish tips to the median coverts and broad pale yellowish tips to greater coverts, forming two prominent wing-bars. Its outermost tail-feather has a whitish edge measuring less than 0.5 mm on the <b>inner</b> <b>web</b> and a indistinctly paler tip; the second outermost tail-feather has an even less distinct pale inner edge and tip. The bird's underside is whitish, indistinctly streaked with pale yellowish, and with slightly more yellowish undertail-coverts. Its iris is dark brown. Its upper mandible is blackish while the lower is pale orange. The tarsus, toes and claws are pinkish-grey, but the tarsus is slightly paler than the toes and claws. The Emei leaf warbler {{is very similar to}} the sympatric Claudia's leaf warbler, but differs mainly in having a less contrasting crown pattern, with lighter lateral crown-stripes and a darker median crown-stripe. The Emei leaf warbler’s estimated generation length is 3.6 years.|$|E
40|$|Amongst {{material}} from the island of Flores forwarded by the Rev. Fr. J. A. J. Verheijen SVD and the Rev. Fr. E. Schmutz SVD is a monarchine flycatcher which appears to represent an undescribed species. It may be known and diagnosed as follows. Monarcha sacerdotum species nova Type and unique specimen, ♂ ad., with large gonads (the testes measured about 7 X 41 / 2 mm each), 25 September 1971, Sesok, Flores, 1000 m, collected in the lower stages of primary forest by E. Schmutz. Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie no. 68135. Diagnosis. — A morphologically very normal member of the genus Monarcha; measurements, including {{size and shape of}} bill, similar to those of M. t. trivirgata (Temminck), but plumage different in two conspicuous characters : 1 ° there is no trace of rust colour or brown in the plumage, the underparts (except for the black throat patch) being pure white; 20 the outer pair of rectrices with much more white : the outer web is white to its base, the <b>inner</b> <b>web</b> is distally white over a length of 38 mm. In M. t. trivirgata the white part of the <b>inner</b> <b>web</b> varies from 24 - 33 mm in length, and on the outer web it is at most a few millimetres longer. The second and third pairs of rectrices have a decreasing amount of white, but also much more than in the corresponding pairs of M. t. trivirgata. The upper parts {{are similar to those of}} M. t. trivirgata : forehead, sides of head, chin and throat patch glossy black, central three pairs of rectrices and upper tail coverts black, remiges and upper wing coverts blackish with grey outer edges, remainder of upper parts grey.

50|$|This {{relatively}} large trogon is 28 to 30 cm long. As most trogons, it is strongly sexually dimorphic. In the male {{the head and}} upper breast are dark blue (appears blackish in poor light), and the back is green, becoming bluer on the rump. The lower underparts are orange-yellow. The wings are black, vermiculated with white. The undertail is almost entirely white with only a very narrow black base to each feather. The complete eye-ring is pale bluish. The female white-tailed trogon resembles the male, but has a grey back, head and breast, and rather indistinct black-and-white barring mainly to the <b>inner</b> <b>webs</b> of each tail feather (less on outer webs).|$|R
50|$|This {{species has}} been split by Rasmussen and Anderton (2005) from: the Indian {{nuthatch}} and Burmese nuthatch. The chestnut-bellied nuthatch {{is very similar}} to the previous but with a heavier bill, crown and mantle of the same shade. The wing and tail markings show contrasting markings; silvery-edge to primaries, blackish <b>inner</b> <b>webs</b> to tertials and tail with large white spots in the tail. White on ear coverts does not extend into chin unlike in the former. Race almorae of Nepal and NW Himalayas has paler underparts; race koelzi of the eastern Himalayas has the female darker than in other races. Resident from Murree Hills to the Uttaranchal foothills extending to the Assam Valley, Arunachal Pradesh into the Lushai Hills.|$|R
50|$|Red-tailed amazons weigh around 425 g and are {{approximately}} 35 cm long. As expected from its common name, {{it has a}} broad red band on its tail, but as it largely {{is limited to the}} <b>inner</b> <b>webs</b> of the feathers, it is mainly visible from below or when the tail is spread open. Additionally, the tail has a broad yellow tip, and the outer rectrices are dark purplish-blue at the base. The remaining plumage is green, while the throat, cheeks and auriculars are purple-blue, the forecrown is red, and the retrices are broadly tipped dark blue. It has a yellowish bill with a blackish tip to the upper mandible, a pale gray eye ring, and orange irises. Juveniles have a duller plumage and a brown irises.|$|R
