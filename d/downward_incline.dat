The air was maintained at room temperature and the wall is heated by Joule effect. The temperature difference between the wall and the air was prefixed at 25 K and the wall placement had been varied from the vertical to different <b>downward</b> <b>inclined</b> positions (5 °, 10 °, 15 °, 20 °, 25 ° and 30 °). The experimental results had shown an increase in the heat transfer coefficient, at the different wall inclinations, due to the jets; actually they had induced turbulence in the dynamic field, by interrupting the laminar flow. Our aim was to optimize the variables involved in the phenomenon, in order to find out the highest enhancement of the heat transfer coefficient values, caused by the jets. The variables were the number of active horizontal lines of jets, their activity and the inactivity time and their velocity. We had also investigated the conditions without jets and we found out that the heat transfer coefficient trend versus the downward inclination angles, could not be described by correlations present in literature. In fact, in the investigated range of the downward wall inclinations, the heat transfer coefficient did not may be simply correlated with the cosine of the angle, but it increased up to a maximum value, reached at 15 °, and then decreased. The visualization by smoke had confirmed these results: the boundary layer thickness had followed this trend. In correspondence to the wall inclination equal to 15 °, it reached its minimum value. Finally, to the purpose to link the experimental data, we had proposed a numerical correlation.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{constitutes}} a preliminary {{study of the}} two-phase flow in a Gas-Liquid Cylindrical Cyclone (GLCC 1) separator. A GLCC consists in a vertical pipe with a <b>downward</b> <b>inclined</b> tangential inlet. The incoming flow forms a swirling motion producing a centrifugal force. The gas and liquid are thus separated due to both centrifugal and gravity forces. Therefore the separation efficiency is higher than for conventional vessel type separators, allowing more compactness. In this study, {{the aim is to}} better understand the swirling hydrodynamics of this separator via CFD simulations. Therefore, the single-phase hydrodynamics is calculated for swirling flows generated by means of tangential injection(s) in a straight pipe. Geometry and flow conditions are chosen according to the experimental study of Erdal (2001 a), who performed local measurements of the axial and tangential velocities. BANS, URANS and LES simulations are carried out using different turbulence models and different near wall treatments. Among the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models, the high-Reynolds realizable kappa-epsilon model performs the best for predicting the local mean axial and tangential velocities. Its results are as good as the LES ones when the fluid is injected through only one inlet, while LES predicted flow is closer to the experimental one for two inlets. Numerical results also show that, contrary to the common approximation of the literature, the radial velocity magnitude is not negligible. The vortex core precession is well predicted by the simulations, which show that its direction is the opposite of the swirl one. We think that the growth of the turbulence kinetic energy in the core of the flow is directly linked to this phenomenon. Finally computations are conducted to investigate the effect of the inlet geometry on the cyclone hydrodynamics. According to simulations, the rectangular inlet performs better than a circular one, since it reduces the vortex distortion, which is supposed to improve the separation efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Undesired air {{entrainment}} in bottom outlet conduits of dams may cause pressure transients, leading to conduit vibrations, blowback, discharge pulsation and even cavitation, and jeopardize the operational safety. Due to design limitations or construction costs, {{it is impossible}} to create an air free environment in a pressurized pipe. Therefore, it is essential to understand the air transport in enclosed pipes in order to provide guidance in bottom outlet design and operation. The commonly used criterion of the air-pocket movement in pipe flow is the water flow velocity for starting moving an air pocket, the so-called critical velocity. In this thesis, the classical Volume of Fluid (VOF) model combined with the k-ε turbulence model is adopted for the computation of the critical velocity of a 150 -mm pipe. The computed critical velocities are compared with the experimental results. The governing parameters investigated in this study include pipe slope and diameter, wall shear stress and air-pocket volume. Meanwhile, the carrying capacity (air-pocket velocity/ flow velocity) at all pipe slopes are analyzed. The simulation results of air pockets with different volumes in the bottom outlet conduit of Letten Dam in Sweden are presented in this study. Moreover, experimental study was conducted to measure the critical velocity for a 240 -mm Plexiglas pipe. The results are in agreement with the experiments performed by HR Wallingford (HRW) in 2003 in terms of the effects of pipe slope and air-pocket volume; however, the critical Froude pipe number is slightly smaller in this study. In rough pipes, a larger critical velocity is required compared with that in the smooth pipe. The removal mechanism in the rough pipe involves the successive loss of air caused by turbulence. This explains that the air-pocket size, with the dimensionless air-pocket volume n <  0. 015, has little impact on the critical velocity for the rough pipe. In addition, roughness has little impact on the air-pocket velocity when it moves upstream in the <b>downward</b> <b>inclined</b> pipe. The trapped air bubbles most likely remain permanently in the rough pipe. QC 2012011...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} this work is to gain insight into the {{behaviour}} of two-phase flow in horizontal and <b>downward</b> <b>inclined</b> pipes. An experimental flow facility was built to investigate flow patterns developed over three pipe orientations of 0 º, - 15 º and - 30 º, using air-water as the fluid combination and a 19 mm diameter test section. Superficial velocities for air ranged from 0. 5 to 5. 0 m/s with an increment of 0. 5 m/s and for water from 0. 1 m/s to 0. 9 m/s with a 0. 1 m/s increment. Flow visualization was conducted for flow pattern identification, and a high-speed video system was employed to obtain image sequence of the flow under different pre-selected conditions. Flow pattern maps were developed showing the effect of pipe orientation on flow pattern transition. Liquid hold-up, using a volume collection method, and pressure drop, using a differential pressure transducer, were measured. Also, stratified to slug flow transition regime in horizontal pipes was investigated using a non-intrusive optical technique – Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) – to evaluate the velocity field of the liquid phase. This was achieved by {{the application of a}} PIV laser-induced fluorescence technique (LIF), whereby seeding particles impregnated with fluorescent dye (Rhodamine B); Fluorescent Polymer Particles 20 - 50 micrometers, 100 g was used.

Typical production loss could be as high as 50 %, affecting the ability to meet growing energy demand. This work is based on numerical simulation using OLGA (OiL and GAs) a one- dimensional and two-fluid equations based commercial tool for the simulation and analysis of a typical field case study in West Africa. Numerical model was adopted for the field case. Based on the field report, Flow Loop X 1 consisted of well X 1 and well X 2, (where X 1 is the well at the inlet and X 2 is the well connected from the manifold (MF)). Slugging was experienced at Flow Loop X 1 at 3000 BoPD; 4 MMScf/D and 3 %W/C. This study investigated the conditions causing the slugging and the liquid and gas phase behaviour at the period slugging occurred. The simulation work involved modelling the boundary conditions (heat transfer, ambient temperature, mass flowrate e. t. c). Also critical was the modelling of the piping diameter, pipe length, wall thickness and wall type material to reflect the field geometry. Work on flow regime transition chart showed that slugging became more significant from 30 % water-cut, especially at the riser base for a <b>downward</b> <b>inclined</b> flow on the pipeline- riser system. Studies on diameter effect showed that increasing diameter from 8 ” – 32 ” gave rise to a drop in Usg (superficial velocity gas) and possible accumulation of liquids on the riser- base position and hence a tendency for slugging formation. Depth effect study showed that increasing depth gave rise to increasing pressure fluctuation, especially at the riser- base. Studies on the Self-Lift slug mitigation approach showed that reducing the internal diameter of the Self-lift by-pass pipe was effective in mitigating slug flow. S 3 (Slug suppression system) was also investigated for deepwater scenario, with the results indicating a production benefit of 12. 5 %. In summary, the work done identified water-cut region where pipeline-riser systems become more susceptible to slugging.

Weight and small footprint requirements for {{applications such as}} subsea separation, downhole separation, and compact gas monetization systems is driving interest in using cyclonic separator for bulk gas-liquid separation. Unfortunately, the challenge of coping with the effect of unsteady inlet flow behaviour on the separator performance limit it acceptance for bulk gas-liquid separation. Fundamental understanding of the flow behaviour inside the separator under various inlet flow conditions is required {{to deal with the}} challenge. While most published work have addressed flow behaviour in the lower half of cyclonic separator, this thesis concentrated on the upper half. A gas-liquid pipe cyclonic separator was setup at Cranfield University for bulk gas-liquid separation. Large amount of data at the inlet and upper part of the separator were acquired using electrical resistance tomography (ERT), wire meshes sensor (WMS), conductivity hold up probe and pressure transducers. The acquired data were used in analysing flow regimes, upward swirling liquid film (USLF), zero-net liquid flow (ZNLF), liquid holdup and, general separator performance. It was found from analysis of USLF data that a maximum USLF height exists for every constant superficial liquid velocity. A correlation based on dimensionless numbers was proposed for predicting this height. Experimental results on ZNLF showed that a critical ZNLF also exist above which liquid carryover can take place. The liquid holdup for this critical ZNLF was measured under separator operating condition using ERT and a correlation for predicting the liquid holdup was proposed. Four flow regimes were identified as swirling annular, light-mist heavy-mist and churn using visual observations, ERT, WMS and pressure transducer. A flow regime map was proposed based on gas and liquid Froude number. The performance based on the operating envelope for liquid carryover and pressure drop for horizontal and 270 <b>downward</b> <b>inclined</b> tangential inlet was compared. It was concluded that the separation performance was marginally improved by using an inclined tangential inlet. The pressure drop for the inclined inlet was far greater than that of horizontal inlet.

The change in shape of the bubble is almost instantaneous and has a significant effect on the localised hydrodynamics around the bubble, which could influence the dynamics of the flow patterns in the Hall-Heroult cell.
