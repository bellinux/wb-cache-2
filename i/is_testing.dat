5|$|In rabbinical tradition, {{the age of}} Isaac at {{the time}} of binding is taken to be 37, which {{contrasts}} with common portrayals of Isaac as a child. The rabbis also thought that the reason for the death of Sarah was the news of the intended sacrifice of Isaac. The sacrifice of Isaac is cited in appeals for the mercy of God in later Jewish traditions. The post-biblical Jewish interpretations often elaborate the role of Isaac beyond the biblical description and primarily focus on Abraham's intended sacrifice of Isaac, called the aqedah ("binding"). According to a version of these interpretations, Isaac died in the sacrifice and was revived. According to many accounts of Aggadah, unlike the Bible, it is Satan who <b>is</b> <b>testing</b> Isaac as an agent of God. Isaac's willingness to follow God's command at the cost of his death has been a model for many Jews who preferred martyrdom to violation of the Jewish law.|$|E

25|$|An {{innovative}} use of {{the diamond}} anvil cell <b>is</b> <b>testing</b> the sustainability and durability of life under high pressures. This innovative use {{can be used in}} the search for life on extrasolar planets. One reason the DAC is applicable for testing life on extrasolar planets is panspermia, a form of interstellar travel. When panspermia occurs, there is high pressure upon impact and the DAC can replicate this pressure. Another reason the DAC is applicable for testing life on extrasolar planets is that planetary bodies that hold the potential for life may have incredibly high pressure on their surface.|$|E
25|$|Screening by {{hysteroscopy}} {{to obtain}} cell samples obtained for histological examination is being developed. This {{is similar to}} the current pap smear that is used to detect cervical cancer. The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening <b>is</b> <b>testing</b> a screening technique that combines CA-125 blood tests with transvaginal ultrasound. Other studies suggest that this screening procedure may be effective. However, it's not yet clear if this approach could actually help to save lives—the full results of the trial will be published in 2015. One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. Another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery. The ROCA method combined with transvaginal ultrasonography is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method. It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population. Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.|$|E

500|$|Q {{returns to}} the bridge too, to talk Picard into setting a wager. He {{explains}} that the Q Continuum <b>is</b> <b>testing</b> Commander Riker {{to see if he}} is worthy of being granted their powers. Picard, having the utmost faith in his First Officer, takes the bet, as winning it would mean Q would get off their backs. [...] Meanwhile, Riker and his team are attacked by what Lt. Worf reports as [...] "vicious animal things" [...] wearing French soldier's uniforms from the Napoleonic era and armed with muskets that fire energy bolts instead of the classic projectiles. Q returns to Riker and tells him that he has granted him the powers of the Continuum, and Riker promptly returns his crew mates to the ship but remains behind with Q to ultimately reject the powers. Q brings the crew back to the landscape, this time without their phasers and with Picard. The crew are attacked once more by the aliens, and both Worf and Wesley Crusher are killed. Riker uses the powers of the Q to return the crew again and bring both Worf and Wesley back to life.|$|E

The results are interpreted as indicating the use of rationalizations to buttress a decision not to <b>be</b> <b>tested,</b> the powerful influence on HIV decision-making exerted by salient perceptible features, and the ‘status quo bias’.
