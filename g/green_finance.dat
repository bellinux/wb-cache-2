40|$|Green {{bonds and}} fossil {{divestment}} {{has emerged as}} a bottom-up approach to climate action within the business community. Recent pledges by large banks and institutional investors have reached levels that have the potential to contribute markedly to a low carbon transition. This paper traces the impact of <b>green</b> <b>finance</b> in a multiregional global general equilibrium model with non-fossil and non-coal segments of financial flows in addition to the usual unconstrained market for funding. Our high <b>green</b> <b>finance</b> scenario reflects a reasonable upscaling of current level of pledges towards 2030. The study shows that <b>green</b> <b>finance</b> shifts the investments towards industries generating more value added and increasing GDP, future savings and investments. The <b>green</b> <b>finance</b> leads to a lower return on investments and a transfer of income from investors to wage income. Russia and China see the largest cost increase in coal investments due to constraints on finance for fossil industries. The <b>green</b> <b>finance</b> reduces coal consumption by 2. 5 per cent below BAU in 2030 and raises the share of non-fossil electricity from 42 to 46 per cent at the global level. Over the whole period towards 2030, the <b>green</b> <b>finance</b> avoids global CO 2 emissions corresponding to the total emissions of European Union and Japan in a recent year...|$|E

The research considers established entrepreneurial firms attempts to acquire <b>green</b> technology <b>financing.</b> By observing a <b>green</b> technology <b>financing</b> scheme (GTFS) a competency trap is identified that constrains established entrepreneurial firms, regardless of their excellent financing track record and previous business success in other ventures. Utilising Rasmussen et al. ’s (2011, 2014) evolutionary entrepreneurial competency framework, the research examines how established entrepreneurial firms develop the entrepreneurial competencies to overcome this trap and acquire <b>green</b> technology <b>financing.</b> By comparing different established entrepreneurial firms during the process to acquire financing, the research examined the GTFS contextual influence on the deployment of competencies, revealing the multi-faceted nature of the competency trap. In order to acquire GTFS financing the research identified two sets of entrepreneurial necessary competencies; (i) opportunity refinement competencies (ii) resource acquisition competencies. However, development of these competencies {{is influenced by the}} established entrepreneurial firms’ paths and the competency trap. Four different pathways to address the competency trap are highlighted. This emphasizes the need for more contextual based research at multiple levels of analysis to understand established entrepreneurial firms’ transition into sustainable entrepreneurship ventures...|$|R
