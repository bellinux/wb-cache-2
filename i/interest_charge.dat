2500|$|The Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Program, as {{designed}} by Westbrook and his team, called for government construction of houses or apartments to be occupied—and eventually owned—by middle-income defense workers. [...] A {{key to the}} plan was the commitment made {{by the federal government}} to sell the projects, {{at the conclusion of the}} emergency period, to a non-profit Mutual Housing Corporation made up of the projects' residents. This cooperative, non-profit corporation would be initially supported and advised by the government and later turned over completely to the members. This corporation would be responsible for amortizing the government backed mortgage over a 45-year period through monthly payments that included a 3% <b>interest</b> <b>charge</b> on the unpaid balance. Each of the project's residents would be a member of the corporation, and receive a contract from the corporation entitling him/her to perpetual use of his/her unit and one share of stock in the corporation. The monthly payment made by each member to the corporation would include individual amortization payments based on a 30-year rate, as well as set costs for maintenance, taxes, insurance, major repairs, etc. Each share was interchangeable among residents, thus allowing families to easily exchange different size units as family sizes and needs changed over the years.|$|E

6000|$|The {{relative}} {{amount of}} the United States public debt may be seen, [...] by Chart No. XXII, from an early date down to 1880. Since the war, [...] the surplus revenue of the United States has been constantly [...] appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during [...] the late war, until, what with the reduction of debt and the fall [...] in the <b>interest</b> <b>charge,</b> our income is now so much greater than [...] expenditure that we are (1884) actually in difficulties owing to [...] the surplus. To the present time the Treasury {{has been able to}} use [...] its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt; but the rapidity [...] of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured [...] debt will exist to be redeemed: $250,000,000 of 4-½ per cent bonds [...] remain, but they do not fall due until 1891; and the 4 per cent [...] bonds to the amount of $737,620,700 do not mature until 1907. [...] Having once raised a large revenue under war pressure, it seems [...] very difficult for people to understand now why heavy duties were [...] originally levied, and the extraordinary suggestion is often made [...] that the surplus should remain, and new channels of expenditure [...] should be made (such as enormous pensions), simply in order to [...] keep up the heavy taxation. The difficulty is, however, that the [...] unnecessary surplus exists because of customs duties levied for [...] war purposes. But the heavy burden of war taxation ought not to be [...] continued, adding to the cost of production in all industries, [...] without doing a greater wrong than would be done by the [...] passing—and only possible—trouble of a redistribution of capital [...] in a few cases; especially since that distribution of capital will [...] be one from less productive to more productive industries; [...] otherwise, no change would be made.|$|E

6000|$|... 5. But {{even this}} is not all. There is a further {{provision}} of devastating significance. Bonds representing payments in excess of $15,000,000,000 {{are not to be}} issued until the Commission is satisfied that Germany can meet the interest on them. But {{this does not mean that}} interest is remitted in the meantime. As from May 1, 1921, interest is to be debited to Germany on such part of her outstanding debt as has not been covered by payment in cash or kind or by the issue of bonds as above,[114] and [...] "the rate of interest shall be 5 per cent unless the Commission shall determine at some future time that circumstances justify a variation of this rate." [...] That is to say, the capital sum of indebtedness is rolling up all the time at compound interest. The effect of this provision towards increasing the burden is, on the assumption that Germany cannot pay very large sums at first, enormous. At 5 per cent compound interest a capital sum doubles itself in fifteen years. On the assumption that Germany cannot pay more than $750,000,000 annually until 1936 (i.e. 5 per cent interest on $15,000,000,000) the $25,000,000,000 on which interest is deferred will have risen to $50,000,000,000, carrying an annual <b>interest</b> <b>charge</b> of $2,500,000,000. That is to say, even if Germany pays $750,000,000 annually up to 1936, she will nevertheless owe us at that date more than half as much again as she does now ($65,000,000,000 as compared with $40,000,000,000). From 1936 onwards she will have to pay to us $3,250,000,000 annually in order to keep pace with the interest alone. At the end of any year in which she pays less than this sum she will owe more than she did at the beginning of it. And if she is to discharge the capital sum in thirty years from 1930, i.e. in forty-eight years from the Armistice, she must pay an additional $650,000,000 annually, making $3,900,000,000 in all.[115] ...|$|E

5000|$|The sum of {{the daily}} {{balances}} of the previous two cycles is used, but interest is charged on that amount only over the current cycle. This can result in an actual <b>interest</b> <b>charge</b> that applies the advertised rate to an amount that does not represent the actual amount of money borrowed over time, much different that the expected <b>interest</b> <b>charge.</b> The interest charged on the actual money borrowed over time can vary radically from month-to-month (rather than the APR remaining steady). For example, a cardholder with an average daily balance for the June, July, and August cycles of $100, 1000, 100, will have interest calculated on 550 for July, which is only 55% of the expected interest on 1000, and will have interest calculated on 550 again in August, which is 550% higher than the expected interest on the money actually borrowed over that month, which is 100.|$|E
