[...] Windsor said that she was [...] "over the moon" [...] to return, adding: [...] "I had a great time when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> to film {{for a couple of weeks}} recently.

500|$|It {{was around}} this time that Nirvana's Nevermind was making waves in the rock and pop scene.

Jackson got Cobain on the phone so that Yankovic could make his request. Cobain agreed, although he asked if the new parody was [...] "going to be a song about food".

500|$|Many {{viewers and}} fans of EastEnders {{expected}} Poppy's return {{to be only}} temporary, and thought that she would depart soon after her return. However, it was announced on 24 October that Kirkwood's successor Lorraine Newman decided that Bright will remain with EastEnders {{for the foreseeable future}} as a regular character. Upon this news, Digital Spy announced that Wood-Davis had been cast as Tansy Meadow, Poppy's younger sister, who appeared for one episode. Poppy is [...] "less than enthusiastic" [...] to hear about her sister's visit. In 30 October 2012 episode, Poppy, along with Fatboy (Norwood) host a Halloween ghost tour of the Square organised showing people where former residents have died. A BBC representative said, [...] "The backroom staff {{had a lot of fun}} planning this one". Newman stated in an interview in November 2012 that there is [...] "plenty more on the table" [...] for Poppy adding, [...] "We'll see Poppy become involved in a relationship very soon, which is progressing very well in the material we're working on at the moment. She'll become far more involved in the Square and the friendships within those groups". Digital Spy also revealed Poppy's new relationship, adding that [...] "viewers will have to wait and see who she falls for and how things pan out as the new plot develops". This was confirmed as Fatboy, and the two kiss in 22 November's episode. The pair [...] "grow close" [...] after Tansy's visit, where Fatboy acts as Poppy's [...] "high-flying" [...] businessman boyfriend in front of Tansy, trying to make herself look good in front of her [...] "successful sibling". Bright said of their relationship, [...] "It's really sweet. I don't think Poppy or Fatboy realised they liked each other as they've been friends for a while. She's unsure at first because she doesn't want to ruin a friendship. She's also been unlucky in love, so she's a little bit wary. But I think she can trust Fatboy". Bright expressed her delight at working with Norwood upon her return, after being disappointed she did not work with him during her first stint. In an interview with Metro she said, [...] "Before I started the show Fatboy was one of my favourite characters. I was gutted I didn’t work with him the first time round so when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> and they told me about Poppy and Fatboy’s relationship, I was just so excited. Their characters are perfect for each other. Poppy and Fatboy are a little bit of light in a lot of gloom around the Square. It’s important to have a bit of comedy between everything else. I’m very lucky". She also expressed her wish for the two to get married, adding that their relationship [...] "looks long term".|$|E
