The first batch of 85 NABI diesel-electric hybrid 42-foot buses <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> order, with delivery expected within a year. The new buses will replace some of Metroâ€™s older Orion V, Neoplan AN460A and New Flyer C40LF buses, which were delivered in 1997-2002. Going forward, the contract gives Metro the option to order up to 498 additional 42-foot buses and up to 71 60-foot buses over the five-year period. Red/silver painted buses will be used on [...] "Local" [...] routes and blue/silver buses will be used on [...] "MetroExtra" [...] routes. These buses will have either a red stripe {{in front of the}} bus for [...] "Local" [...] routes or a blue stripe in front of the bus for [...] "MetroExtra" [...] routes for easy identification. The numbering represents its region of operation. To differ the regions numbering system, Maryland letter is (prefix) to the route number and Virginia letter is (suffix) to the route number. For example: C22 (Maryland) & 15L (Virginia).|$|E
500|$|... "Hello Kitty" [...] was {{generally}} panned by music critics. While labeling it [...] "weird", Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "a dubstep track {{that seems to}} acknowledge its own tokenism by adopting a 'J-Pop American Funtime Now!' sheen." [...] Despite praising her [...] "techno-pop" [...] influence, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard felt that [...] "it's a bold stab at a genre outside of Lavigne's oeuvre, but it never comes together. By the 20th time 'Hello Kitty, you're so pretty' is declared, the listener's attention <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> the next track." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that the song [...] "bypasses bubblegum so it can settle into the embarrassing". While reviewing and stating {{that most of the}} album was [...] "soggy", Chuck Eddy from Rolling Stone felt that [...] "Hello Kitty" [...] was the most playful song on the album and called it [...] "J-pop-via-Kesha". Robert Corpsey from Digital Spy was mixed on his opinion of the song, writing that [...] "the juddering electro-pop beats of 'Hello Kitty' serve as an ode to her you-know-what as well as her sizeable Japanese fanbase. As a curveball, it works brilliantly; but as an attempt to make her sound current in today's EDM-pop dominated charts, it falls considerably short." ...|$|E

Novak) comes to Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch, and after a talk with Toby, Ryan tells Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that he is giving him an official warning about his job performance. Ryan denies that his action is motivated by Jim's previous complaints to David Wallace, saying he thrives on constructive criticism (while Toby's comments to the documentary crew indicate he is not upset about the warning, owing to his envy of Jim's relationship with Pam). [...] Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) is selling his 2001 Nissan Xterra for $8,700, and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) pressures him into selling it for $1,500 less than the asking price, because according to Dwight, [...] " [...] car is crap". Dwight assures Andy that he will only use it as a wagon and dragged by a mule on Dwight's beet farm. Andy then sells it to Dwight, who, in a passive-aggressive method of getting back at him for dating Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), washes it and posts a sign asking for $9,995 for the vehicle, which upsets Andy when he finds Dwight's advertisement posted on the cabinet in the office kitchen. Dwight declares that it <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> Ebay which he claims is the subject of a three-way bidding war.|$|E

500|$|The Satanic Bible {{has also}} {{received}} {{a large amount of}} criticism from people and organizations who find its content to be dangerous. Much of this criticism came during the period of [...] "Satanic panic," [...] when Satanic ritual abuse was feared to be epidemic. Much of this media coverage, however, has been denounced as [...] "uncritical and sensationalized." [...] Tom Harpur condemns the book as [...] "blasphemous" [...] and [...] "socially seditious," [...] and blames it for causing an increase in gruesome violence, ritual abuse, and other obscene acts. Critics have also accused The Satanic Bible of encouraging violence and murder, particularly in young people considered to be impressionable. Dawn Perlmutter criticizes it for providing adolescents with bad messages and messages that can be easily misinterpreted. Possession of The Satanic Bible has been used by some studies to identify adolescents who are antisocial, and some warn that possession of the book is a warning sign of emotional issues. The Council on Mind Abuse took a very negative view of The Satanic Bible. Former Executive Director Rob Tucker warned parents to look for The Satanic Bible in their children's bedrooms, saying, [...] "You have to help the child fight this obsession like any other addiction" [...] and [...] "It's like giving drugs to a kid who <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> the edge." [...] Attempts to ban the book from schools and public libraries have been made in various places around the world, and bans or limitations on the book in prisons have been repeatedly challenged in court. However, opposition to The Satanic Bible has rarely led to its removal; these bans are rare. The book was banned in South Africa from 1973 to 1993.|$|E

When a rhyme surprises and extends the fixed relations between words, that in itself protests against necessity.

Often overlooked and underestimated in the direction of his work is his profound poetic debts to and critical engagement with 20th-century Eastern European poets, and in particular Nobel laureate CzesÅ‚aw MiÅ‚osz.|$|E

2500|$|The double slit experiment, {{like the}} other six {{idealized}} experiments (microscope, split beam, tilt-teeth, radiation pattern, one-photon polarization, and polarization of paired photons), imposes a choice between complementary modes of observation. In each experiment we {{have found a way}} to delay that choice of type of phenomenon to be looked for up to the very final stage of development of the phenomenon, and it depends on whichever type of detection device we then fix upon. That delay makes no difference in the experimental predictions. On this score everything we find was foreshadowed in that solitary and pregnant sentence of Bohr, [...] "...it...can make no difference, as regards observable effects obtainable by a definite experimental arrangement, whether our plans for constructing or handling the instruments are fixed beforehand or whether we prefer to postpone the completion of our planning until a later moment when the particle <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> its way from one instrument to another." ...|$|E

2500|$|Once hooked, a small trout can {{be easily}} {{retrieved}} [...] "on the reel" [...] or by simply pulling in the fly line with the reel hand while pinching {{the line between the}} rod handle and the index finger of the rod hand. It is important to keep the rod tip high, allowing the bend of the rod to absorb the force of the fish's struggles against the line. Larger trout will often take line in powerful runs before they can be landed. Unlike spin fishing where the line <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>on</b> the reel, playing a large fish with fly line and a fly reel can present a special challenge. Usually, when a fish is hooked, there will be extra fly line coiled between the reel and the index finger of the rod hand. The challenge is to reel up the loose fly line onto the reel without breaking off a large fish (or getting the line wrapped up around the rod handle, one's foot, a stick or anything else in the way). With experience, really large trout can be put on the reel simply by applying light pressure on the outgoing line using the fisher's fingers. Once the extra line is on the reel, an angler can use the reel's drag system to tire the fish. It is important to use heavier tippet material if it won't spook the fish. The reason why this is important is an exhausted fish can easily die if released too soon. Heavier tippet material enables the angler to land the fish while not over exhausting it.|$|E
