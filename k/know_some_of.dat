Thorson later stated his belief that the USAF accident investigation report and subsequent proceedings had been manipulated in order to avoid holding Wickson and May accountable for their actions. Thorson also stated that he believed that Starr had submitted an inaccurate and misleading report on May's Article 32 hearing to the USAF commanding officers, including Dallager and Santarelli. With regard to the AWACS personnel, Thorson added that, [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the AWACS crew were incompetent beyond belief, and there is more than adequate evidence to conclude that several crewmembers were grossly negligent." ...|$|E
500|$|The Elder {{election}} {{is an old}} tradition at Seio Girls' Academy where every June {{one of the students}} is elected by her peers to be the [...] "Elder", who is seen as the number one [...] "Elder Sister" [...] in the school. Until her graduation, she is referred to by her peers as [...] To become an Elder, a candidate must gain at least 75% of the votes. If none of the candidates get at least 75% {{in the first round of}} voting, one of the candidates hands over her votes to another candidate, and the candidate who finally obtains at least 75% of the votes becomes the Elder. If there is no one else in the election, the current year's student council president becomes the Elder. In Otoboku, Mizuho gains 82% of the votes in the first round, effectively becoming the 72nd Elder in the school's history. After becoming Elder, Mizuho progressively gets more popular among the student body since he is now a symbol of the school's excellence.

When National Semiconductor, which made their own microprocessor chips in '77 or '78, decided they needed a BASIC [...] they asked, 'What's the most popular BASIC?' And the answer was Microsoft BASIC because everybody had copied it and everybody was using it. So we made Microsoft the standard BASIC. National Semiconductor went to Microsoft and bought a license, they were in business that way. This was the marketing function and the hobbyists did the marketing with a complete antipathy of the company in question.

2500|$|Within the church, {{there have}} also been a number of {{unofficial}} statements regarding gender. For example, [...] "Strengthening Our Families: An In-Depth Look at the Proclamation on the Family" [...] (a book compiled by the School of Family Life at the church-owned Brigham Young University) states, [...] "Although we do not fully understand the eternal nature of gender, we should acknowledge its meaning and purpose, and humbly seek to understand and appreciate the nature of divine gender distinctions in God's plan for His children." [...] The book also states: God created us male and female. This is not a mistake or a variety of genetic or hormonal chance. What we call gender is an essential characteristic of our existence prior to our birth. Gender is part of our eternal identity and essential to our eternal progression. Although we may not know all the reasons why this is so, we do <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the reasons why gender is essential to our eternal progression. To achieve our exaltation, an eternal marriage {{between a man and a}} woman is necessary. ...The sexual union between a married man and woman is, among other things, the means God has ordained to bring His spirit children into mortality, which is an essential step in the plan of salvation.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{returning}} from a year of study at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence (cut short by the First World War), Schmitt returned to Warren, where he received a number of commissions from prominent local citizens including Joseph G. Butler, Jr. and Henry K. Wick. In 1916 Schmitt returned to New York, where he established a studio in the Stuyvesant Square neighborhood. Hart Crane, then an unknown poet and newly arrived in New York, was a frequent visitor to Schmitt’s studio apartment {{in the early part}} of 1917. Crane and Schmitt had met in Warren the previous year through Crane’s aunt and Schmitt’s patron Zell Hart Deming. Just before moving to New York, Crane wrote to Schmitt about his life in Cleveland, Ohio. In one of his first letters to his mother from New York, Crane wrote, “Carl is a more wonderful man than you have any idea. A tremendous thinker!” A little later he wrote to his father: “Nearly every evening since my advent has been spent in the companionship of Carl. Last night... we talked until twelve, or after, behind our pipes. He has some splendid ideas.” Crane got to <b>know</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the poets and writers in Schmitt's circle, including Conrad Aiken. Although they would each pursue their own interests and friends in later years, Schmitt and Crane carried on an extensive correspondence, Crane sending drafts of his poems to Schmitt for his review. They saw each other for the last time in 1925 in New York with Zell Hart Deming. Crane described his friend at this meeting: [...] "He was as always, looked and acted exactly the same as we remember him." [...] A portrait of Crane by Schmitt, done almost 50 years later, is now in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC.|$|E
