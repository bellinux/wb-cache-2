5|$|On 15 January 2014, a {{spending}} bill {{passed by the}} House appropriated $100 million for the GCV program, even though the Army had requested $592 million for the program for FY 2014. The Army planned to spend 80 percent of its <b>ground</b> <b>vehicle</b> modernization budget on the GCV over the next 5 years, with costs ranging from $29-$34 billion depending on overruns and setbacks. Several options were being considered to make the program more affordable, including reducing the squad size from their optimum goal of nine men and using new emerging, and undeveloped, technologies to reduce {{the weight of the}} vehicle to 30 tons for operations in urban environments. The two contractors would run out of money for development of their prototype vehicles by June 2014 unless the Army funded the rest of the technology development phase. The Pentagon and Army tried to find ways to continue the program, without actually starting vehicle production, through new technologies like advanced fire control systems and hybrid engines. Although the Army wanted 1,894 Ground Combat Vehicles with a target price of $9–10.5 million per unit, the Pentagon's Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation estimated a unit cost of up to $17 million. The 83-percent cut in funding essentially scaled back the GCV program to a research effort. The program had declined in support over the past months with the Army determining that the desired vehicle was no longer feasible in the near term due to budget reductions, suspicion from the contractors that the program would not move past technology development, and Congress's believing it would not succeed.|$|E

25|$|Thermal {{management}} and acoustic noise reduction would be utilized to avoid detection. The vehicle {{would be able}} to avoid threats by laying obscurants. An array of hit avoidance systems would be leveraged and the Army offered the various active protection systems developed for the manned <b>ground</b> <b>vehicle</b> program. The GCV enabled the detection and neutralization of mines at standoff ranges. The vehicle was also to be equipped with an engagement detection system. The Army required the IFV to have the passive blast protection level equal to the MRAP. The Army made available the composition of the armor of the manned <b>ground</b> <b>vehicle</b> program. A transparent armor shield would provide protection for the vehicle commander when exposed through the turret. Personnel would leverage harnesses and restraints to mitigate trauma. In addition, a Vehicle Health Management System would provide vehicle diagnostic monitoring systems for commanders. A fire suppression system and ammunition detonation protection would be utilized for damage control.|$|E
25|$|The Army {{emphasized}} affordability, rapid deployment, and {{low risk}} {{technology for the}} GCV. The Army required that {{all aspects of the}} Ground Combat Vehicle be at technology readiness level 6. The shortfalls of rapid deployment would be mitigated through an incremental addition of components as technology matures. The Army provided details from the Manned <b>Ground</b> <b>Vehicle</b> effort to utilize on the GCV. The GCV was required to have better protection than any vehicle in the military's inventory.|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{technology}} of unmanned <b>ground</b> <b>vehicles,</b> {{it is necessary to}} conduct a proper evaluation on various technologies. Previous evaluation methods are mainly based on completion of the task; this may mislead most of teams of unmanned <b>ground</b> <b>vehicles</b> using a conservative strategy during the evaluation. In this paper, a new evaluation method is proposed. Based on typical working conditions including intersection, car-following, and obstacle-avoiding, the new evaluation indicator system is established, and the entropy-cost function method is applied to the comprehensive evaluation of unmanned <b>ground</b> <b>vehicles.</b> As reported in a numerical example, the proposed evaluation method can get a quantitative result that authentically reflects the intelligent behavior level of unmanned <b>ground</b> <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R

25|$|Fw 190 V5g: (große Fläche — large surface) In August 1940 a {{collision}} with a <b>ground</b> <b>vehicle</b> damaged the V5 and it {{was sent back to}} the factory for major repairs. This was an opportune time to rebuild it with a new wing which was less tapered in plan than the original design, extending the leading and trailing edges outward to increase the area. The new wing had an area of 18.30m² (197ft²), and now spanned 10.506m (34ft 5in). After conversion, the aircraft was called the V5g for große Fläche (large surface). Although it was 10km/h (6mph) slower than when fitted with the small wing, V5g was much more manoeuvrable and had a faster climb rate. This new wing platform was to be used for all major production versions of the Fw 190.|$|E

25|$|Upon the airplane's {{arrival at}} the gate, {{soldiers}} boarded the airplane to arrest Aquino. The soldiers escorted him off the airplane and onto the jet bridge; however, instead of following the jet bridge to the terminal, they exited the jet bridge down the service staircase onto the apron, where a military vehicle was waiting {{to bring him to}} prison. Sometime between his egress from the aircraft and his boarding of the <b>ground</b> <b>vehicle,</b> several gunshots were heard. When the firing stopped, Aquino and a man later identified as Rolando Galman lay dead on the apron, both from gunshot wounds. Aquino's body was carried into an Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM) van by two AVSECOM SWAT soldiers, while another soldier at the bumper of the van continued to fire shots at Galman. The AVSECOM van sped away, leaving behind the bullet-riddled body of Galman. The subsequent Sandiganbayan ruling later established that Aquino had died before arriving at Fort Bonifacio General Hospital. However, this remains controversial due to contrary evidence presented in court interviews of General Custodio.|$|E
25|$|After the war the Hispano {{variants}} disappeared {{fairly quickly}} as fighter armament {{due to the}} introduction of revolver cannon, based on the prototype versions of the never-produced German wartime Mauser MG 213 cannon. The British introduced the powerful revolving 30mm ADEN cannon in most of their post-war designs, while the French used the very similar DEFA cannon, firing similar ammunition. Similarly, the USAF introduced the 20mm M39 cannon to replace the M24, while the Navy instead combined the original Hispano design with a lighter round for better muzzle velocity in the Colt Mk 12 cannon. As a <b>ground</b> <b>vehicle</b> mounted gun, either anti-aircraft or as a general-purpose autocannon, the HS.404 lasted into the 1960s. A powered turret variant is still in production in Honduras, and is used as a light anti-aircraft gun by the army and navy in several nations. The A/N M3 was developed into the Mk16 Colt 20mm automatic cannon, one of the main weapons on boats of the Mobile Riverine Force in the Vietnam War and also used on some larger amphibious ships.|$|E
25|$|If {{designed}} {{strictly to}} deliver the performance required by the original specification, the interceptor would {{have been forced to}} glide back to ground from heights of up to 100,000ft (30,500m), perform an unpowered landing many miles away, after which it would then have to be recovered and taken back to the airfield by <b>ground</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Revised specifications from the Ministry were issued to Avro and Saunders-Roe, under which the auxiliary turbojet engine had become an official and explicitly-stated requirement. The auxiliary engine was required to provide sufficient power to allow the interceptor to fly back to its base {{in the aftermath of a}} combat mission. On 12 December 1952, further refinement of the rocket interceptor concept had led to the release of the defined Specification OR 337. The changes contained within the defined specification mainly revolved around armament changes, such as the adoption of the Blue Jay (as it was codenamed at the time) infrared-guided air-to-air missile under development, which replaced the originally-envisaged retractable battery of 2-inch rockets.|$|E

Army Chief of Staff Robert Gates announced his intention of halting funding for the XM1206 Infantry Carrier Vehicle of the FCS manned <b>ground</b> <b>vehicle</b> program in April 2009. In late May, Army and Department of Defense representatives outlined plans for the cancellation of Future Combat Systems and the initiation of the Ground Combat Vehicle program in its place.

It was concluded at this meeting that an Infantry Fighting Vehicle {{was to be the}} first vehicle variant fielded.

On 23 June, Future Combat Systems was formally dissolved and many programs including the Manned <b>Ground</b> <b>Vehicle</b> program were canceled with it.
