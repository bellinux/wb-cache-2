40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the confinement time of a non-neutral 7 Be <b>ion</b> <b>plasma</b> in a Malmberg-Penning trap we have implemented an electron dump system to expel electrons from the plasma.

The electron dump shifts the voltages on the plasma confinement rings to make them all negatively charged, thus forcing the electrons to leave. Theoretically, this can be accomplished without disrupting the <b>ion</b> <b>plasma.</b> We built an AC coupling box to coordinate the ring shifts and arranged the system to be run automatically through LABVIEW.

The experimental conditions address both single ion and binary <b>ion</b> <b>plasma</b> flows for the case of a body whose size is large in comparison with the Debye length, when the potential difference between the body and the plasma is relatively small.

This instability is understood as a continuous secular transfer of energy from the electrostatic wave to the ion sound wave through the ponderomotive force. The exact mechanism of this transfer is exposed.

Both of these characteristics are important because the plasma in LEO is relatively cold (e. g., Te ~ 0. 1 eV) and the ram energy of the ions due to the motion of the satellite relative to the LEO plasma is high (e. g., 7, 800 m/s which corresponds to ~ 5 eV for O+ <b>ions).</b> <b>Plasma</b> source operational conditions of flow rate and discharge power are presented that allow the electron temperature to be adjusted over a range from 0. 14 to 0. 4 eV.
