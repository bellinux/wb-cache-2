5|$|Stone and Blackwell {{developed}} a private agreement aimed at preserving and protecting Stone’s financial independence and personal liberty. In monetary matters, {{they agreed that}} the marriage be like a business partnership, with the partners being “joint proprietors of <b>everything</b> <b>except</b> <b>the</b> results of previous labors.” Neither would have claim to lands belonging to the other, nor any obligation for the other’s costs of holding them. While married and living together they would share earnings, but if they should separate, they would relinquish claim to the other’s subsequent earnings. Each would {{have the right to}} will their property to whomever they pleased unless they had children. Over Blackwell’s objections, Stone refused to be supported and insisted on paying half of their mutual expenses. In addition to financial independence, Stone and Blackwell agreed that each would enjoy personal independence and autonomy: “Neither partner shall attempt to fix the residence, employment, or habits of the other, nor shall either partner feel bound to live together any longer than is agreeable to both.” During their discussion of marriage, Stone had given Blackwell a copy of Henry C. Wright’s book Marriage and Parentage; Or, The Reproductive Element in Man, as a Means to His Elevation and Happiness, and asked him to accept its principles as what she considered the relationship between husband and wife should be. Wright proposed that because women bore the results of sexual intercourse, wives should govern a couple’s marital relations. In accordance with that view, Blackwell agreed that Stone would choose “when, where and how often” she would “become a mother.” In addition to this private agreement, Blackwell drew up a protest of laws, rules, and customs that conferred superior rights on husbands and, as part of the wedding ceremony, pledged never to avail himself of those laws.|$|E

25|$|Because Judaism prohibits suicide, Josephus {{reported}} that the defenders had drawn lots and killed each other in turn, {{down to the last}} man, who would be the only one to actually take his own life. Josephus says that Eleazar ordered his men to destroy <b>everything</b> <b>except</b> <b>the</b> foodstuffs to show that the defenders retained the ability to live, and so had chosen death over slavery. However, archaeological excavations have shown that storerooms which contained their provisions were also burnt, though whether this was by Romans, by Jews, or natural fire spreading is unclear.|$|E
25|$|The {{only part}} of the railway {{property}} that remained Lowe's was the observatory on Echo Mountain. It boasted a 16-inch (406.4mm) reflective telescope from which many astronomical finds were made. It was blown down in a gale in 1928. The railway fell in stages to the Echo Mountain House fire, a kitchen fire on February 4, 1900; a wind-aided brush fire on Echo Mountain in 1905, which wiped out <b>everything</b> <b>except</b> <b>the</b> observatory and the astronomer's cabin; a Rubio Canyon flash flood in 1909 that destroyed the Pavilion; and an electrical fire that razed the Tavern in 1936. The line was abandoned after the Los Angeles deluge of March 1938.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 the summer-only {{operation}} of Geauga Lake continued. Rumors {{ranging from the}} total closing of Geauga Lake to closing <b>everything</b> <b>except</b> <b>the</b> water park to scaling back the rides area even more were rampant. Cedar Fair {{refused to comment on}} the rumors. The 2007 Oktoberfest held on September 14–16, 2007, was the final weekend for the amusement park. On Friday, September 21, 2007, Cedar Fair announced its decision to permanently close the ride side of Geauga Lake park and that Wildwater Kingdom side would reopen exclusively as a water park called Geauga Lake's Wildwater Kingdom. This led to efforts to save Geauga Lake, especially landmarks such as the Big Dipper and the Carousel, including an online petition and letters to public officials.|$|E

Alexandra is rescued from a larger misfortune, that of marrying the repugnant Leo, by Birdie, the only person able to do so, who wills herself the courage to tell the younger woman not to marry the wrong man (i.e. Leo), lest she bear the consequences {{for the rest of}} her life. Unfortunately, Oscar overhears part of the conversation and, after Alexandra is out of earshot, slaps Birdie hard.|$|E
25|$|In one of {{the caves}} on the Kyffhäuser, lives Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor {{surrounded}} by his cavaliers, somewhat {{similar to those of}} Fruela and Bernardo del Carpio. The Covadonga area is also rich with astonishing stories, such as the one which is said to have happened in a shepherd village where today Enol and Ercina lakes are situated. Mary, mother of Jesus, disguised as a pilgrim, is said to have visited that village and asked for food and shelter from every house of that village. She was rudely rejected by every person, except for a shepherd who gave her refuge and warmly shared everything he had. On the following day, as punishment for their lack of hospitality, a flood of divine origin devastated the village, which completely covered <b>everything</b> <b>except</b> <b>the</b> cottage of the good shepherd. In front of him, the mysterious guest started to cry, and her tears became flowers when they reached the floor. Then the shepherd realized that the pilgrim was actually Mary.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{said that}} Freeman's casting {{developed}} {{the way in}} which Cumberbatch played Holmes. The theme of friendship appealed to both Gatiss and Moffat. Gatiss asserted the importance of achieving the correct tone for the character. [...] "Watson is not an idiot, although it's true that Conan Doyle always took the piss out of him," [...] said Gatiss. [...] "But only an idiot would surround himself with idiots." [...] Moffat said that Freeman is [...] "the sort of opposite of Benedict in <b>everything</b> <b>except</b> <b>the</b> amount of talent... Martin finds a sort of poetry in the ordinary man. I love the fastidious realism of everything he does." [...] Freeman describes his character as a [...] "moral compass" [...] for Sherlock, who does not always consider the morality and ethics of his actions.|$|E

500|$|The Pirates of Penzance (New Year's Eve, 1879) also poked fun at grand opera conventions, {{sense of}} duty, family obligation, the [...] "respectability" [...] of {{civilisation}} and the peerage, and {{the relevance of}} a liberal education. The story also revisits Pinafores theme of unqualified people in positions of authority, {{in the person of}} the [...] "modern Major-General" [...] who has up-to-date knowledge about <b>everything</b> <b>except</b> <b>the</b> military. The Major-General and his many daughters escape from the tender-hearted Pirates of Penzance, who are all orphans, on the false plea that he is an orphan himself. The pirates learn of the deception and re-capture the Major-General, but when it is revealed that the pirates are all peers, the Major-General bids them: [...] "resume your ranks and legislative duties, and take my daughters, all of whom are beauties!" ...|$|E
500|$|Thome's {{friendly}} personality {{has been}} the subject of much attention. In a 2007 poll of 464 MLB players, he tied with Mike Sweeney for second-friendliest player, behind Sean Casey. After Thome hit his 600th home run, Twins closer Joe Nathan said, [...] "He is the world's nicest man." [...] Teammate Michael Cuddyer added, [...] "He is the nicest, gentlest, kindest guy you will ever meet... to <b>everything</b> <b>except</b> <b>the</b> baseball, he still hits that really hard." [...] His kindness comes up in conversations with many MLB players. When he signed with the Phillies in the offseason before the 2012 season, Phillies general manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. cited Thome's constant positive attitude as a main reason for his signing. As an exercise in remaining humble, he annually visited his high school prior to spring training. A Sports Illustrated article said that Thome frequently signs autographs for fans and that he is [...] "endlessly patient with requests". In a piece for Philadelphia magazine discussing Thome's Baseball Hall of Fame prospects, sportswriter Stephen Silver wrote, [...] A fan poll in The Plain Dealer in 2003 named him the most popular athlete in Cleveland sports history.|$|E

Each would have the right to will their property to whomever they pleased unless they had children. Blackwell advised Stone to secure all her money {{in the hands of a}} trustee for her benefit. Stone agreed to <b>everything</b> <b>except</b> <b>the</b> issue of marital support. She refused to be supported by Blackwell and insisted on paying half of their mutual expenses. Despite Blackwell's strenuous objection, Stone remained adamant.|$|E
