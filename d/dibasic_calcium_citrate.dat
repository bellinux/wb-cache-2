We therefore measured serum and urinary aluminum before and following <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> therapy in patients with moderate renal failure and in normal subjects maintained on constant metabolic diets with known aluminum content (967 - 1034 mumol/day, or 26. 1 - 27. 9 mg/day, in patients and either 834 or 1579 mumol/day, or 22. 5 and 42. 6 mg/day, in normal subjects). Seven patients with moderate renal failure (endogenous creatinine clearance of 43 ml/min) took 50 mmol (2 g) calcium/day as effervescent <b>calcium</b> <b>citrate</b> with meals for 17 days. Eight normal women received 25 mmol (1 g) calcium/day as tricalcium dicitrate tablets with meals for 7 days. In patients with moderate renal failure, serum and urinary aluminum were normal before treatment at 489 +/- 293 SD nmol/l (13. 2 +/- 7. 9 micrograms/l) and 767 +/- 497 nmol/day (20. 7 +/- 13. 4 micrograms/day), respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of polymer level and type of some hydrophobic polymers, including hydrogenated castor oil (HCO); Eudragit RS 100 (E-RS 100); Eudragit L 100 (E-L 100), and some fillers namely mannitol [soluble filler], <b>Dibasic</b> <b>calcium</b> phosphate dihydrate (Emcompress) and anhydrous <b>dibasic</b> <b>calcium</b> phosphate [insoluble fillers] on the release rate and mechanism of baclofen from matrix tablets prepared by a hot-melt granulation process (wax tablets) and wet granulation process (E-RS 100 and E-L 100 tablets). Statistically significant differences were found among the drug release profile from different classes of polymeric matrices. Higher polymeric content (40 %) in the matrix decreased the release rate of drug because of increased tortuosity and decreased porosity. At lower polymeric level (20 %), the rate and extent of drug release was elevated. HCO was found to cause the strongest retardation of drug. On the other hand, replacement of Emcompress or anhydrous <b>dibasic</b> <b>calcium</b> phosphate for mannitol significantly retarded the release rate of baclofen, except for E-L 100 (pH-dependent polymer). Emcompress surface alkalinity and in-situ increase in pH of the matrix microenvironment enhanced the dissolution and erosion of these matrix tablets.

OVX rats supplemented with CPs or CP-calcium citrate showed osteoprotective effects, with reductions in the OVX-induced decreases in their femoral bone mineral density. Moreover, CP-calcium citrate prevented trabecular bone loss, improved the microarchitecture of the distal femur, and significantly inhibited bone loss with increased bone volume, connectivity density, and trabecular number compared with OVX control rats. CP or CP-calcium citrate administration significantly increased serum procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide levels and reduced serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and C-telopeptide of type I collagen levels.
