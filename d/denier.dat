5|$|The various Germanic {{states in}} the west all had coinages that imitated {{existing}} Roman and Byzantine forms. Gold continued to be minted {{until the end of}} the 7th century, when it was replaced by silver coins. The basic Frankish silver coin was the denarius or <b>denier,</b> while the Anglo-Saxon version was called a penny. From these areas, the <b>denier</b> or penny spread throughout Europe during the centuries from 700 to 1000. Copper or bronze coins were not struck, nor were gold except in Southern Europe. No silver coins denominated in multiple units were minted.|$|E

In The Eleventh Hour, Tyndall spoke approvingly of Holocaust <b>denier</b> David Irving. In promoting Holocaust denial, Tyndall and those close to him may have been seeking to rehabilitate Hitler and the Nazi government in the British public's view.|$|E
5|$|David John Cawdell Irving (born 24 March 1938) is an English Holocaust <b>denier</b> {{and author}} {{who has written}} on the {{military}} and political history of World War II, {{with a focus on}} Nazi Germany. His works include The Destruction of Dresden (1963), Hitler's War (1977), Churchill's War (1987), and Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich (1996). In his works, he argued that Hitler did not know of the extermination of Jews or, if he did, opposed it. Though Irving's revisionist views of World War II were never taken seriously by mainstream historians, he was once recognised for his knowledge of Nazi Germany and his ability to unearth new historical documents.|$|E

Irving visited Stiefel unannounced and tried to find out the name of the source, but the collector misled him as to the origin. Irving examined Priesack's photocopies and saw a number of problems, including spelling mistakes and the change in writing style between certain words.|$|E
