25|$|Ghostface {{has been}} parodied and {{referenced}} numerous times in media following his {{appearance in the}} Scream series of slasher films, most prominently in the parody film Scary Movie (2000) where a killer dressed as Ghostface commits a series of murders and is later revealed to be several people as in Scream. In the parody film Shriek If You <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>Did</b> Last Friday the Thirteenth (2000), a killer wearing a Jason Voorhees-style hockey mask is set on fire, his mask melting to resemble that of Ghostface. The film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001) features Ghostface, as Shannen Doherty and Craven provide cameos as themselves making the then non-existent Scream 4, but Doherty objects when Ghostface {{turns out to be}} played by the orangutan, Suzann.|$|E

2500|$|Swank again won the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Actress {{for playing}} a female boxer in Clint Eastwood's 2004 film Million Dollar Baby, {{a role for}} which she {{underwent}} extensive training in the ring and weight room gaining 19 pounds of muscle, aided by professional trainer Grant L. Roberts. With her second Oscar, she had {{joined the ranks of}} Vivien Leigh and Luise Rainer as the only actresses to have been nominated for Academy Awards twice and won both times. After winning her second Oscar, she said, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in this life to deserve this. I'm just a girl from a trailer park who had a dream." ...|$|E

2500|$|International {{opposition}} and criticism {{from both the}} Catholic Party and the Labour Party caused the Belgian parliament to compel the king to cede the Congo Free State to Belgium in 1908. The deal {{that led to the}} handover cost Belgium the considerable sum of 215.5 million Francs. This was used to discharge the debt of the Congo Free state and to pay out its bond holders as well as 45.5 million for Leopold's pet building projects in Belgium and a personal payment of 50 million to him. [...] The Congo Free State was transformed into a Belgian colony known as the Belgian Congo under parliamentary control. Leopold {{went to great lengths to}} conceal potential evidence of wrongdoing during his time as ruler of his private colony. The entire archive of the Congo Free State was burned and he told his aide that even though the Congo had been taken from him, 'they have no right to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> there.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Different {{opinions}} and questions started to surface over the magazine editors' negligence and choice of dress. There were also suspicions that {{the incident was}} a set-up to ruin Zhao's career. [...] On 28 December 2001, during her performance at a concert, Zhao was attacked on stage by Fu Shenghua, a construction worker who later said his grandparents were killed during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Reflecting upon his actions, Fu told a Chinese magazine: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> wasn't right. But I believe my cause was just... As a famous Chinese person, {{she should have been}} aware of such an important event in Chinese history." [...] Later, a Chinese newspaper, Beijing Youth Daily published a special report after a two-month investigation and alleged that Fu had lied to the media, claiming that no one in his family had died during the war and that he was not a construction worker but instead had been unemployed for several years. The journalist noted that it was difficult to have conversations with Fu due to his alleged extremist views. More and more people started to believe that the incident was a set-up and the public views started shifting more empathetically towards Zhao. After this report was published, the hype surrounding the incident died down and the Chinese media seldom mentioned it again.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Manchester, indeed!' said Coningsby; 'if you <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> about Manchester! A pretty state we {{have been}} in in London this week past with your Manchesters and Birminghams!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I feel that. Only, it's {{so hard to}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> really think--there's always such a lot {{trying to}} make one feel that only what's nice and cosey is right!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's just it. I couldn't {{accept your}} offering. After The Morning came in, my soul revolted. I ordered the Alessandra {{manuscript}} brought in. Do you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with it?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But it {{has been}} so," [...] she said. [...] "I cannot wash out the past. <b>Knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> of myself, Sir Peregrine, I should never have put my foot over your threshold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{this is so}} unusual, that--that--well, you see indeed I am so unprepared--I don't quite <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> mean. Dear me, can't you explain? Don't you {{see that}} this is a most ex----" ...|$|R
6000|$|She replied confidentially, 'Why I am so earnest {{not to be}} {{seen with}} you is that I may appear to people to be {{independent}} of you. <b>Knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> of your weaknesses <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> no otherwise. You must be schooled into--' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, Madam Budd, yes; I {{dare say}} it is so, {{and ought to be}} so; and I ask pardon for having said as much as I did. But my love for your niece is of so {{animated}} and lastin' a natur', that I scarce <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said Charles, [...] "the defence {{that would}} have served my {{innocent}} cousin cannot serve me, who <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> to Oakshott. I am now aware that {{it is quite possible}} that the sword might not have killed him, but when I threw him into that vault I sealed his fate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear, good Maynard,' she said, {{stretching}} out her little hand, and taking {{two of his}} large fingers in her grasp, while her tears flowed fast; 'I am very cross to you. But my heart is breaking. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Good-bye.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> want now. <b>I</b> {{had made}} up my mind a minute ago, and now it's all gone again--oh yes, I remember, the red. Yes, I'll have the red. No, I don't mean the red, I mean the grey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I am ashamed," [...] replied Joan. [...] "I don't mean that. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> mean. But still I'm {{sorry for}} Kells.

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{must see}} them. I {{told you that}} I had a {{commission}} from them to the Zamenoys, which I have performed, and I must let them <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Besides, father, if this man is to be my husband, is it not well that I should see him?" [...] Old Balatka groaned, but said nothing further, and Nina went forth to the Jews' quarter.|$|E
6000|$|I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Perhaps I sobbed and cried, but {{the first}} words I could get out were, 'Does he know? Oh! {{it may be too}} late.

I sent off a special messenger last night, as soon as I saw my way--' ...|$|E
60|$|At first I smiled; next I chided him. Then I {{told him}} flatly that I stood {{in need of}} no wet-nursing. After that I did not see him when I {{came out of the}} club.

I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stranger," [...] said he, [...] "excuse me for troubling you, but do {{you know}} anybody in this here town named Solomon Smothers?

6000|$|... "Now I don't {{know what}} {{happened}} to the others, but I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I got turned about.

6000|$|... "So {{much the}} better for you, Mr. Daggett. <b>Knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> shall only give up the assets I hold to the {{executor}} and heir.

60|$|I think, verily, this rude {{treatment}} {{of him was}} for some time {{the effect of a}} violent fermentation in my blood; for the very motion which the steady contemplation of my fancied greatness had put my spirits into had thrown me into a kind of fever, and <b>I</b> scarce <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
