50|$|As the London and South Western Railway served Portsmouth, Southampton and Weymouth, it {{developed}} {{a number of}} shipping routes, operating them with its <b>own</b> <b>vessels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The PLA owns three piers and jetties on the River Thames. These are {{available}} for other river users {{as well as the}} PLA's <b>own</b> <b>vessels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pound's naval rank was {{restored}} {{and he was}} later given command of his <b>own</b> <b>vessel,</b> his brief piratical career apparently forgotten. He died in 1703.|$|R
50|$|By 1913 they <b>owned</b> 26 <b>vessels,</b> {{with another}} two under construction, plus a further five under joint {{ownership}} with the London and North Western Railway. The L&YR ran steamers between Liverpool and Drogheda, Hull and Zeebrugge, and between Goole and many continental ports including Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Hamburg, and Rotterdam. The jointly <b>owned</b> <b>vessels</b> provided services between Fleetwood, Belfast and Derry.|$|R
50|$|In 1895 {{the company}} took over two other {{shipping}} concerns, the Humber Steam Shipping Company which <b>owned</b> 3 <b>vessels,</b> and the Yorkshire Coal and Steamship Company which <b>owned</b> 11 <b>vessels.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Somali seamen barred entry to their ports along the coast, while {{engaging}} in trade with Aden and Mocha in adjacent Yemen using their <b>own</b> <b>vessels.</b>|$|R
50|$|They {{tried again}} the {{following}} year (1648). Fedot Alekseyev was joined by two others, Andreev and Afstaf'iev, representing the Guselnikov merchant house, with their <b>own</b> <b>vessels</b> and men, while Alekseyev provided five vessels {{and the majority of}} the men. Gerasim Ankudinov, with his <b>own</b> <b>vessel</b> and 30 men, also joined the expedition. Dezhnyov recruited his own men, 18 or 19, for fur gathering for private profit, as was the custom at the time. The whole group numbered between 89 and 121 people, travelling in traditional koch vessels. At least one woman, Alekseyev's Yakut wife, was with this group.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{all in the}} Master's hands," [...] replied Peter, {{looking up}} with a glad {{expression}} on his weatherworn face. With these words he left the mission smack {{and returned to his}} <b>own</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In February 2011 {{the vessel}} was {{chartered}} to Seatruck Ferries and was deployed on the Heysham to Dublin route until 15 January 2012 when Seatrucks <b>own</b> <b>vessel</b> [...] took over Anglia Seaways operations.|$|R
50|$|The 1945 fleet {{comprised}} 9 starters. Of the 9 starters, 8 yachts {{completed the}} race. Illingworth's <b>own</b> <b>vessel,</b> Rani, won the inaugural race {{in a time}} of 6 days, 14 hours and 22 minutes.|$|R
5000|$|LR's Rules for Ships {{are derived}} from {{principles}} of naval architecture and marine engineering, and govern safety and operational standards for numerous merchant, military, and privately <b>owned</b> <b>vessels.</b> LR's Rules govern a number of topics including: ...|$|R
6000|$|... “That {{will keep}} them a good bit astern,” Will said; “otherwise, if the wind were to drop at night, they might haul their <b>own</b> <b>vessel</b> up to us, and carry out their plan of blowing us up.” ...|$|R
60|$|Before {{he could}} decide {{as to the}} course he ought to pursue, the report {{of one of the}} guns of his <b>own</b> <b>vessel</b> boomed loud and {{distinct}} in the distance. It was almost immediately followed by another.|$|R
60|$|Having wandered so {{far from}} their <b>own</b> <b>vessel,</b> they had taken refuge on the strange {{schooner}} just before the storm broke. She was a Canadian sealer on her first voyage, and as was now apparent, her last.|$|R
50|$|Norden has {{its head}} office in Copenhagen and offices in Singapore, Shanghai, Annapolis, Rio de Janeiro and Mumbai. At its offices {{the company has}} in total 209 {{employees}} and about 300 are employed on the Company’s <b>owned</b> <b>vessels.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not {{the crews}} of {{captured}} vessels often rise upon their captors, and recapture their <b>own</b> <b>vessels?</b> and were {{any of them}} ever called pirates? Besides, nations at war authorise almost every sort of hostile act against their enemies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What if they should?" [...] asked Joe, quickly, {{beginning}} {{to think that the}} yacht-owner did not appear to have many rights on board of his <b>own</b> <b>vessel.</b> [...] " [...] Can't you take your boat when you want to?" ...|$|R
60|$|Much was now said, chiefly by {{the party}} of the other part, but our boatman paid little {{attention}} to any of it. The boys scrambled on board their <b>own</b> <b>vessel.</b> We pushed apart, hoisted sail, and were soon speeding away.|$|R
50|$|Because of his skills, by {{the time}} he was twenty, Truxtun had {{garnered}} command of his <b>own</b> <b>vessel,</b> Andrew Caldwell. Before the Revolution he was impressed into the Royal Navy and was offered a midshipman's warrant, which he turned down.|$|R
30|$|There {{are also}} a number of crucial {{internal}} factors. Companies can be locked in transport contracts that bind them {{to continue with the}} existing logistics structure even though there might be cheaper alternatives. If the company <b>owns</b> its <b>own</b> <b>vessels</b> and built a logistics structure for maritime transport it will be harder to shift freight to land-based modes of transport. On the other hand, implementation of operational measures {{such as the use of}} larger vessels and slow steaming for companies that <b>own</b> their <b>own</b> <b>vessels</b> can help reduce operational costs. The next section addresses the issue of research design with the purpose of analysing the above mentioned aspects in the context of the Swedish forest industry.|$|R
50|$|The Biskop Hvoslef is {{a veteran}} Norwegian sailing vessel built in 1933 {{that was used in}} search and rescue by the Redningsselskapet (Norwegian Society for Rescue at Sea) on the Norwegian coast between 1933 and 1969. It is now a privately <b>owned</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|R
60|$|But, alas! {{before they}} could do {{anything}} the Peters crowd was entirely out of range. They saw the big row-boat taken over to where the yacht lay at anchor. Harry's craft was tied fast to the stern and the Rockpointers clambered aboard their <b>own</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Silsbee was {{the eldest}} child of Capt. Nathaniel and Sarah (Becket) Silsbee. At {{the age of}} fourteen, to support his family upon the {{financial}} failures of his father, he went to sea and learned navigation. His able seamanship won him, {{at the age of}} nineteen, command of Elias Hasket Derby's Sloop [...] "Sally". Silsbee continued commanding Derby vessels and had many interesting adventures and exploits with privateers, French Consuls, and such. In 1795 he became part owner of the Schooner [...] "Betsy" [...] and continued to prosper and master his <b>own</b> <b>vessels.</b> In 1801 he placed his brothers, William and Zachariah, in charge of his ships. Nathaniel continued <b>owning</b> <b>vessels</b> in partnerships until the 1840s, but he actively retired from shipping when he commenced his political career.|$|R
6000|$|The ship's {{course was}} altered, and {{long before the}} wreck was reached her decks swarmed with {{men and women who}} had got up in haste at the first mention of the word [...] "fire"--some of them with a {{confused}} notion that their <b>own</b> <b>vessel</b> was in danger! ...|$|R
60|$|Bonnet {{was in a}} discontented and {{somewhat}} sulky mood, but when Blackbeard's full plans were made known {{to him and he}} found that he might again resume command of his <b>own</b> <b>vessel,</b> the Revenge, if he chose to do so, his eyes began to sparkle once more.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy {{loved the}} sea; {{and now he}} was to go afloat again, in his <b>own</b> <b>vessel,</b> bound by no {{restrictions}} except the necessity for making the voyage pay. This would not be easy; but there was a romance about the undertaking that gave it a zest.|$|R
50|$|After {{moving to}} Boston with his mother, he {{traveled}} extensively, first attending school in Charleston and then serving as second mate on a missionary {{trip to the}} Hawaiian Islands. He arrived in Monterey, Alta California as master of his <b>own</b> <b>vessel,</b> the trading schooner Rover, in 1823.|$|R
50|$|He {{first went}} to sea as a {{volunteer}} aboard the privateer Trinité, under Captain Legoux, on the 16 December 1690. Trinité subsequently captured François Samuel and Seven Stars of Scotland. In 1692 his family provided him with command of his <b>own</b> <b>vessel,</b> a 14-gun lugger, Danycan.|$|R
60|$|The {{tremendous}} {{and close}} volley that succeeded this order nearly accomplished {{the command of}} Barnstable to the letter, and {{the commander of the}} Alacrity, perceiving that he stood alone, reluctantly fell back on the deck of his <b>own</b> <b>vessel,</b> in order to bring on his men once more.|$|R
50|$|He {{brought back}} {{specimens}} for the British Museum and Royal Botanic Gardens, {{as well as}} live polar bears for the London Zoo. By his fourth expedition, Leigh Smith's enthusiasm for Arctic exploration had advanced {{to the point that}} he had his <b>own</b> <b>vessel</b> - Eira - specially built.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{production}} units of the army, navy and air force, as well as units in charge of maintenance for this exhibition, the National People's Army has also worked {{in recent years to}} upgrade the armament and equipment acquired and the construction of its <b>own</b> <b>vessels</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Board her! graybeards and boys, idlers and all!" [...] shouted Barnstable, {{springing}} {{in advance}} of his crew--a powerful arm arrested {{the movement of the}} dauntless seaman, and before he had time to recover himself, he was drawn violently back to his <b>own</b> <b>vessel</b> by the irresistible grasp of his cockswain.|$|R
50|$|He {{began to}} build his <b>own</b> <b>vessels,</b> {{essentially}} selling them to himself at a considerable profit. He built a commercial empire by also selling or renting ships to merchants and this was initially solidified during the American Revolution during which he was given military command {{of most of the}} Great Lakes.|$|R
