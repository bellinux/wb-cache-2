5|$|Negron, in a {{flashback}} tells of his war {{experiences as a}} young corporal of the segregated 92nd Infantry Division in Italy in 1944. A disastrous attack ensues on German positions across the Serchio River. An officer, Captain Nokes, calls down artillery on the 92nd's own position, refusing to believe their reports of <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>they</b> have advanced. Many American soldiers are killed, leaving Negron stranded {{on the wrong side}} of the river with three men: Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps, Sergeant Bishop Cummings, and Private Sam Train. Sam carries the Head of the Primavera that he found in Florence, which he believes to carry magical powers. Sam and Bishop rescue an Italian boy named Angelo from a collapsing building. While traveling through the mountains of Tuscany, the soldiers enter a small village, where they form a bond with the residents. Sam grows especially fond of Angelo, becoming the boy's father figure. One Italian villager, Renata, soon becomes entangled in a love triangle with Stamps and Bishop, which creates conflict.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{intention was}} to fill the aircraft with one gallon of fuel and see <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>they</b> got. Seeing that this would lead to aircraft retrieval problems, the organisers decided that all flights must begin and end at Lypmne. Instead, each was fuelled over a gallon by a standard amount, landing when they judged they had insufficient fuel for another 12.5 miles. If they had used more than one gallon, the calculated consumption was pro rata; if they had used less than one gallon the consumption was nevertheless based on one gallon used.|$|E
25|$|The {{downward}} movement of large, solid objects by scour and settling processes {{has been documented}} by Jesse E. McNinch, John T. Wells, and other researchers.

25|$|C. The All-Ireland Senior Football Championship is {{the premier}} inter-county competition, contested by 31 of Ireland's 32 {{counties}} (plus New York and London). Each county participates {{in their respective}} provincial championship (in Derry's case the Ulster Championship) which operate through a knock-out cup competition format. The winners {{of each of the}} four Provincial Championships earn one of eight places in the All-Ireland quarter-finals. The 28 teams that fail to win their respective provincial championships receive a second opportunity to reach the All-Ireland quarter-finals via the All Ireland Qualifiers. The counties enter the Qualifiers at different stages (depending on <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>they</b> reached in their provincial championship). Four teams come through this system and join the four provincial champions in the All-Ireland quarter-finals. See here for more details.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} aspects of The Magician's Nephew {{parallel}} Lewis' own life. Both Digory and Lewis were {{children in the}} early 1900s, both wanted a pony, and both were faced {{with the death of}} their mothers in childhood. Digory is separated from his father, who is in India, and misses him. Lewis was schooled in England after his mother's death, while his father remained in Ireland. He also had a brother in India. Lewis was a voracious reader when a child, Digory is also, and both are better with books than with numbers. Digory (and Polly) struggle with sums when trying to work out <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>they</b> must travel along the attic space to explore an abandoned house, Lewis failed the maths entrance exam for Oxford University. Lewis remembered rainy summer days from his youth and Digory is faced with the same woe in the novel. Additionally Digory becomes a professor when he grows up, who takes in evacuated children during World War II.|$|E
25|$|The Mona Lisa example pictured {{at right}} {{provides}} a simple illustration. Each {{point on the}} painting can be represented as a vector pointing {{from the center of}} the painting to that point. The linear transformation in this example is called a shear mapping. Points in the top half are moved to the right and points in the bottom half are moved to the left proportional to <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>they</b> are from the horizontal axis that goes through the middle of the painting. The vectors pointing to each point in the original image are therefore tilted right or left and made longer or shorter by the transformation. Notice that points along the horizontal axis do not move at all when this transformation is applied. Therefore, any vector that points directly to the right or left with no vertical component is an eigenvector of this transformation because the mapping does not change its direction. Moreover, these eigenvectors all have an eigenvalue equal to one because the mapping does not change their length, either.|$|E

25|$|Interpretations of {{the role}} of Viola have been given by many well-renowned actresses {{in the latter half of}} the 20th century, and have been {{interpreted}} in the light of <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>they</b> allow the audience to experience the transgressions of stereotypical gender roles. This has sometimes correlated with how far productions of the play go towards reaffirming a sense of unification, for example a 1947 production concentrated on showing a post-World War II community reuniting at the end of the play, led by a robust hero/heroine in Viola, played by Beatrix Lehmann, then 44 years old. The 1966 Royal Shakespeare Company production played on gender transgressions more obviously, with Diana Rigg as Viola showing much more physical attraction towards the duke than previously seen, and the court in general being a more physically demonstrative place, particularly between males. John Barton's 1969 production starred Donald Sinden as Malvolio and Judi Dench as Viola; their performances were highly acclaimed and the production as a whole was commented on as showing a dying society crumbling into decay.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} running events are {{held on the}} track which fall into three broad {{distance}} categories: sprints, middle-distance, and long-distance track events. Relay races feature teams comprising four runners each, who must pass a baton to their teammate after a specified distance {{with the aim of}} being the first team to finish. Hurdling events and the steeplechase are a variation upon the flat running theme in that athletes must clear obstacles on the track during the race. The field events come in two types – jumping and throwing competitions. In throwing events, athletes are measured by <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>they</b> hurl an implement, with the common events being the shot put, discus, javelin, and hammer throw. There are four common jumping events: the long jump and triple jump are contests measuring the horizontal distance an athlete can jump, while the high jump and pole vault are decided on the height achieved. Combined events, which include the decathlon (typically competed by men) and heptathlon (typically competed by women), are competitions where athletes compete {{in a number of different}} track and field events, with each performance going toward a final points tally.|$|E
500|$|Officially {{known as}} the [...] "NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting", but more often called the NFL draft, the event is the NFL's primary {{mechanism}} for distributing newly professional players finished with their college football careers to its teams. The draft order is determined based on the previous season's standings; the teams with the worst win–loss records receive the earliest picks. Teams that qualified for the NFL playoffs select after non-qualifiers, and their order depends on <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>they</b> advanced. The final two selections {{in the first round}} are reserved for the Super Bowl runner-up and champion. Draft picks are tradable, and players or other picks can be acquired with them.|$|E
50|$|Bomber {{aircraft}} can {{release all}} of their bombs at one time ("salvo") or drop individual bombs at intervals.

The game also features two forms of online leaderboards: [...] "Ranking Attack", which challenges players to obtain the best time and score on each level, and [...] "30 Second Trial", which challenges players to see <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>they</b> can get through a level in 30 seconds. The original 1991 Sonic the Hedgehog game can be unlocked in the console versions of the game.|$|E
500|$|By {{six o'clock}} in the evening the Swedes had lost two flagships along with two fleet admirals, {{including}} the supreme commander of the navy. The entire force now began a disorderly retreat: the smaller ships Enhorn, Ekorren, Gripen and Sjöhästen were outsailed and captured {{and the rest of}} the ships sought shelter in friendly harbors. [...] Most set course for Dalarö, north of Stockholm; others tried for Kalmar Strait, between Öland and the Swedish mainland. The allied fleet tried to capitalize further on its victory by giving chase, but the dash up the coast had scattered its forces and there was disagreement among the Danish commanders on <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>they</b> should pursue the Swedish ships.|$|E
500|$|Flanking {{the open}} reading frame, genes contain a {{regulatory}} sequence {{that is required}} for their expression. First, genes require a promoter sequence.

[...] A gene can {{have more than one}} promoter, resulting in messenger RNAs (mRNA) that differ in <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>they</b> extend in the 5'end.
