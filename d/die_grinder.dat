2500|$|The {{condition}} of the material at hand determines what type of abrasive will be applied. The first stage, if the material is unfinished, starts with a rough abrasive (perhaps 60 or 80 grit) and each subsequent stage uses a finer abrasive, such as 120, 180, 220/240, 320, 400 and higher grit abrasives, until the desired finish is achieved. The rough (i.e. large grit) passes remove imperfections within the metal surface like pits, nicks, lines and scratches. The finer abrasives leave progressively finer lines that are not {{visible to the naked}} eye. To achieve a #8 Finish (Mirror) it requires polishing and buffing compounds, polishing wheels and high speed polishing machines or other machine tools {{that can be used for}} polishing, like an electrical drill. Lubricants like wax and kerosene may be used as lubricating and cooling media during these operations, although some polishing materials are specifically designed to be used [...] "dry." [...] Buffing may be done by hand with a stationary polisher or <b>die</b> <b>grinder,</b> or it may be automated using specialized equipment.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Die</b> <b>grinder,</b> {{which is}} a {{high-speed}} hand-held rotary tool with a small diameter grinding bit. They are typically air driven (using compressed air), but can be driven with a small electric motor directly or via a flexible shaft.|$|E
50|$|The <b>die</b> <b>grinder</b> is {{the stock}} in trade of the head porter and are used {{with a variety of}} carbide cutters, {{grinding}} wheels and abrasive cartridges. The complex and sensitive shapes required in porting necessitate a good degree of artistic skill with a hand tool.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{pneumatic}} <b>die</b> <b>grinder</b> throttles (also called triggers) {{feature a}} spring-loaded [...] "kickstand" [...] mechanism between the throttle lever {{and the body}} of the grinder. This prevents the throttle from opening (being pressed down towards {{the body of the}} grinder) without operator intervention and inhibits accidental activation. It is similar in principle to the safety catches used on many handguns.|$|E
50|$|The {{temperature}} of the environment affects how quickly the piece must be completed to avoid the effects of melting; if the sculpting does not {{take place in a}} cold environment, then the sculptor must work quickly to finish his piece. Some sculptures can be completed in as little as ten minutes if the carver is using power tools such as chainsaws and specialty bits fitted to a <b>die</b> <b>grinder.</b>|$|E
5000|$|He {{follows the}} same {{sequence}} of steps when crafting his spoons. First, {{he uses a}} bandsaw to roughly shape the overall form of the spoon. Then, an inflatable sanding drum with very coarse 24-grit sandpaper is used to remove saw marks, smooth out the facets of the cuts, and shape the convex curves of {{the exterior of the}} bowl. He determines the exterior shape first before working {{on the inside of the}} spoon bowl. [...] "It fixes the outside form," [...] he has said, [...] "which is sculpturally what one sees first." [...] A <b>die</b> <b>grinder</b> (rotary tool) with a carbide cutter is then used to remove mass from the concave interior of the bowl. Small cutters are used to further shape the piece, particularly the transition between the bowl and the handle, which he sees as particularly critical. [...] The fine details of the spoon are made with a carving knife, then a <b>die</b> <b>grinder</b> with a ball-shaped burr is used to clean up and refine the interior of the spoon bowl. This is followed by hours of hand work, sanding, scraping, and polishing the work.|$|E
5000|$|Dremel is an American {{brand of}} power tools known {{primarily}} for its rotary tools. Dremel's rotary tools {{are similar to}} the pneumatic <b>die</b> <b>grinders</b> used in the metalworking industry by tool or moldmakers.|$|R
50|$|Burrs (sometimes called rotary files) {{are small}} cutting tools used in <b>die</b> <b>grinders,</b> rotary tools, or dental drills. The name may be {{considered}} appropriate when their small-sized head (3 mm diameter shaft) is compared to a bur (fruit seed with hooks) or their teeth are compared to a metal burr.|$|R
50|$|Collets {{are most}} {{commonly}} found on milling machines, lathes, wood routers, precision grinders, and certain handheld power {{tools such as}} <b>die</b> <b>grinders</b> and rotary tools. There are many different systems, common examples being the ER, 5C, and R8 systems. Collets can also be obtained to fit Morse or Brown and Sharpe taper sockets.|$|R
5000|$|Die {{grinders}} and rotary {{tools are}} handheld power tools used for grinding, sanding, honing, polishing, or machining material (typically metal, but also plastic or wood). All such tools are conceptually similar, with no bright {{dividing line between}} die grinders and rotary tools, although the <b>die</b> <b>grinder</b> name tends {{to be used for}} pneumatically driven heavy-duty versions whereas the rotary tool name tends to be used for electric lighter-duty versions. Flexible shaft drive versions also exist. The <b>die</b> <b>grinder</b> name comes from one of their earliest and archetypal applications, tool and die work, where they were used to create the precise contours of dies or molds. Especially before the advent of widespread CNC usage, they were heavily relied upon for contouring via manual skill comparable to a sculptor's. CNC now provides much of the contouring for die and mold interior surfaces, but die grinders are still very useful for hundreds of cutting needs, from sculpture-like contouring in the absence of CNC, to cut-off of bar stock, to any of the cutting and grinding needs of fabrication, such as in the work of welders, boilermakers, millwrights, ironworkers (steel erectors), sheet metal workers (such as auto body workers and HVAC technicians), to woodworking (especially cabinet making), hacking, and other hobby or business pursuits. Die grinders are often used for engraving, cylinder head porting, and general shaping of a part.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of control {{technologies}} such as numerical control (NC and CNC) and programmable logic control (PLC), duplicate parts being milled on a milling machine could not have their contours mapped out by moving the milling cutter in a [...] "connect-the-dots" [...] ("by-the-numbers") fashion. The only ways to control {{the movement of the}} cutting tool were to dial the positions by hand using dexterous skill (with natural limits on a human's accuracy and precision) or to trace a cam, template, or model in some way, and have the cutter mimic the movement of the tracing stylus. If the milling head was mounted on a pantograph, a duplicate part could be cut (and at various scales of magnification besides 1:1) simply by tracing a template. (The template itself was usually made by a tool and die maker using toolroom methods, including milling via dialing followed by hand sculpting with files and/or <b>die</b> <b>grinder</b> points.) This was essentially the same concept as reproducing documents with a pen-equipped pantograph, but applied to the machining of hard materials such as metal, wood, or plastic. Pantograph routing, which is conceptually identical to pantograph milling, also exists (as does CNC routing). The Blanchard lathe, a copying lathe developed by Thomas Blanchard, used the same essential concept.|$|E
50|$|When a {{modification}} is decided upon through careful flow testing {{with an air}} flow bench, the original port wall material can be carefully reshaped by hand with <b>die</b> <b>grinders</b> or by numerically controlled milling machines. For major modifications the ports must be welded up or similarly built up to add material where none existed.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, {{working from}} {{engineering}} drawings developed by engineers and technologists, tool makers lay out (mark out) the design on {{the raw material}} (usually metal), then cut it to size and shape using manually controlled machine tools (such as lathes, milling machines, grinding machines, and jig grinders), power tools (such as <b>die</b> <b>grinders</b> and rotary tools), and hand tools (such as files and honing stones).|$|R
50|$|A pin chuck is a {{specialized}} chuck {{designed to hold}} small drills (less than 1 mm in diameter) {{that could not be}} held securely in a normal drill chuck. The drill is inserted into the pin chuck and tightened; the pin chuck has a shaft which is then inserted into the larger drill chuck to hold the drill securely. Pin chucks are also used with high-speed rotary tools other than drills, such as <b>die</b> <b>grinders</b> and jig grinders.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{failure cause}} and failure mode of cutting tool is {{analyzed}} {{based on the}} reliability analysis on cutting tool of vertical shearing machine. Reliability calculation model is established, and experimental research on cutting tool is operated. The {{results show that the}} critical failure mode of cutting tool is electric <b>die</b> <b>grinder.</b> The crucial failure cause is that in the shearing process, the UO 2 ceramic in the fuel components is crushed into particles with high hardness, these hard material will lead to tool wear. The reliability of cutting tool is 0. 892, which can’t achieve the spent fuel reprocessing working shearing machine reliability requirements. The structure and materials of cutting tool must be improved. The parallel distance between the upper surface of cutting tool and the lower surface of the pressing block has to be adjusted...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{quantify}} the temperature {{changes in the}} dental pulp associated with equine dental procedures using power grinding equipment. Design A matrix experimental design with replication on the same sample was followed to allow the following independent variables to be assessed: horse age (young or old), tooth type (premolar or molar), powered grinding instrument (rotating disc or <b>die</b> <b>grinder),</b> grinding time (15 or 20 seconds) and {{the presence or absence}} of water coolant. Procedure Sound premolar and molar teeth from a 6 -year-old horse and a 15 -year-old horse, which had been removed postmortem, were sectioned parallel to the occlusal plane to allow placement of a miniature thermocouple at the level of the dental pulp. The maximum temperature increase, the time taken to reach this maximum and the cooling time were measured (n= 10 in each study). The teeth were placed in a vice and the instrument used on the tooth as per clinical situation. Results Significant differences were recorded for horse age (P < 0. 001), instrument type (P < 0. 001), grinding time (P < 0. 001) and presence or absence of coolant (P < 0. 001). There was no significant difference for tooth type. Conclusion Thermal insult to the dental pulp from the use of power instruments poses a significant risk to the tooth. This risk can be reduced or eliminated by appropriate selection of treatment time and by the use of water irrigation as a coolant. The increased dentine thickness in older horses appears to mitigate against thermal injury from frictional heat...|$|E
