Continuous monitoring of environmental variables was carried out at 6 stations in Oso Bay over a 9 -month period beginning in February and ending in December of 2013.

Each zone was different in terms of the physical and biochemical processes occurring there. In April, no hypoxia was observed on the shelf because of water column mixing by winds, even though high discharge occurred from the MARS. Nutrients were abundant in the surface waters but present only in little amounts at the bottom. In June, the water column was highly stratified. Because of the presence of upwelling favorable winds no vertical mixing occurred and caused extensive hypoxia on the shelf. <b>Dissolved</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>concentrations</b> were negatively correlated with nutrients {{at the bottom of the}} water column. Nutrients were considerably higher at the bottom than at the surface (except for zone A, where high nutrients were seen even at the bottom), indicating remineralization below the pycnocline.
