500|$|This {{movie was}} also the subject of comment from feminist critics. Mimi Nguyen says the film [...] "pokes fun at the {{ultimately}} repressive gender roles that seek to make Mulan a domesticated creature". Nadya Labi agreed, saying [...] "there is a lyric in the film that gives the lie to the bravado of the entire girl-power movement." [...] She pointed out that Mulan needed to become a boy {{in order to accomplish}} what she did. Kathleen Karlyn, an assistant professor of English at the University of Oregon, also criticized the film's portrayal of gender roles: [...] "In order to <b>even</b> <b>imagine</b> female heroism, we're placing it in the realm of fantasy". Pam Coats, the producer of Mulan, said that the film aims to present a character who exhibits both masculine and feminine influences, being both physically and mentally strong.|$|E
500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could <b>even</b> <b>imagine.</b> So when we get there, they already know how to play our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E
500|$|During the game's planning, it {{was decided}} that it should not be {{directly}} connected to Shin Megami Tensei, ensuring that it would hold interest independent from the first game; because of this, Kaneko envisioned it as a story loosely based on Shin Megami Tenseis future. At first, he imagined it to take place ten years after the first game, as he thought that would be roughly the amount of time needed for society to rebuild, but another staff member wanted it to take place hundreds of years later. Kaneko disagreed, saying that culture would have changed a lot over a hundred years, and that he could not <b>even</b> <b>imagine</b> what the world would look like a hundred years into the future or what it had been like during the Meiji period. The two had different ideas about the timeline of the series, but eventually decided to set the game [...] "several decades" [...] after Shin Megami Tensei. They made use of the tree of life as a central theme of the story.|$|E

500|$|After {{the death}} of Batory in 1586, Zamoyski helped Sigismund III Vasa gain the Polish throne, {{fighting}} in the brief civil war against the forces supporting Habsburg archduke Maximilian III of Austria. The camp supporting Sigismund was rallied around Zamoyski, whereas Maximilian {{was supported by the}} Zborowski family. Zamoyski defended Kraków and defeated Maximilian's forces in the Battle of Byczyna in 1588. In that battle, which Sławomir Leśniewski describes as [...] "one of the most important in Polish history, and the most important in Zamoyski's military career", Maximilian was taken prisoner and in the resulting Treaty of Bytom and Będzin of 1589 had to give up all pretenses to the Polish crown. Later that year Zamoyski proposed a reform of the royal elections, which failed to pass the Sejm. Zamoyski presented to this Sejm a project that in case the present King should die without issue none but a candidate of some Slav stock should henceforth be eligible to th Polish throne. This was a project which could <b>even</b> <b>imagine</b> the possibility of some kind of union between Catholic Poland, Orthodox Moscovy and semi-Protestant Bohemia. In fact, it was a circuitous and clumsy counter-proposal against pro-Hapsburg policy.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{started to}} {{participate}} in climbing competitions in the mid-1980s, but {{one of her first}} significant accomplishments was in 1979. She became the first person to free climb Ophir Broke in Ophir, Colorado, which has a difficulty rating of 5.12d and was the hardest route ever climbed by a woman at that time. It was the hardest crack climb in Colorado at the time and there were only one or two harder ones in Yosemite. Long was amazed by her feat. He has said [...] "that's when I knew for certain that this woman had extraordinary talent". The regional guidebook credits Long with the first free ascent of the route; Hill speculates {{the reason for this is}} that at the time she was an unknown climber and known only as Long's partner and protege. In her autobiography, Hill explains that it was during this climb that she realized it is not a person's size or strength but ability to be creative on the rock that is important: [...] "The big lesson for me... was to realize that despite what appeared to be a limitation due to my small stature, I could create my own method of getting past a difficult section of rock. John's size and power enabled him to make long reaches and explosive lunge moves that were completely out of my range. I, on the other hand, often found small intermediate holds that John couldn't <b>even</b> <b>imagine</b> gripping... Short or tall, man or woman, the rock is an objective medium that is equally open for interpretation by all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Afterwards, {{the subject}} is alluded to during {{specific}} cases, such as when the team deals with a rape victim {{at the end of}} Season 7 and an abused wife in the middle of Season 8. In the latter case, Head Medical Examiner Ducky Mallard (David McCallum) suggests that Gibbs have Ziva be the one to confront the woman, saying, [...] "Agent David has been through things you and I can't <b>even</b> <b>imagine,</b> and she knows what it's like to be controlled." [...] Michael Nouri was brought back to guest star as Eli David during the eighth season, and the consequences of his actions are addressed. Ziva is able to forgive him somewhat, and he tries to reach a full reconciliation in Season 10's [...] "Shabbat Shalom". However, he is killed in a targeted shooting before he is able to make peace with his daughter, greatly devastating Ziva and prompting her to embark on a campaign of revenge against the man responsible: Ilan Bodnar.|$|E

2500|$|The {{contest between}} the King and the Chancellor began during Sigismund's first Sejm sitting, the {{so-called}} [...] "Pacification Sejm", which met at Warsaw in March 1589. Zamoyski presented {{the project of}} a political combination between Poland, Moscovy, and Bohemia, coupled with a suggestion that in case the present King should die without issue (a somewhat premature and gratuitous assumption in the circumstances), none but a Prince of some Slavonic stock should henceforth be eligible to the Polish throne. The extravagance of a project that could <b>even</b> <b>imagine</b> any sort of union between Catholic Poland, Orthodox Moscovy, and semi-Protestant Bohemia struck even {{the majority of the}} Sejm with amazement. It was only explicable as a circuitous and clumsy attempt to traverse the Habsburg influence. The Parliament promptly rejected it, accepting instead the royal proposition of a marriage between Sigismund and the Archduchess Anne. The way had already been opened for this rapprochement with Austria by the Treaty of Bytom and Będzin (March 1589), negotiated by the Nuncio Ippolito Aldobrandini, afterwards Pope Clement VIII, whereby the Emperor resigned all his claims to the Polish Crown.|$|E
2500|$|Critic John Simon {{wrote in}} a review of the play, [...] "Selective patrons cannot <b>even</b> <b>imagine</b> what horrors reviewers are exposed to, night after nightmarish night." [...] Associated Press drama critic Jay Sharbutt {{described}} the play as comprising [...] "a lot of labored skulduggery, frantic slapstick, dashes upstairs, downstairs and sideways, assorted gunshots and half the population of this caper dispatched to a better world, if not better play" [...] and declined to identify the cast [...] "pending notification of [...] kin". Douglas Watt of the New York Daily News called it an [...] "incredibly sappy murder mystery farce" [...] that shouldn't happen to a moose and said that he had forgotten how it ended, while the New York Posts Clive Barnes said that it was [...] "so indescribably bad that I do not intend to waste anyone's time by describing it." [...] He commended Eve Arden for leaving it before it opened and commented: [...] "Some people have all the luck." [...] Arthur Bicknell has also said that one member of the public, on spotting him in the street, shouted 'Officer, arrest that show!' ...|$|E
2500|$|The second {{approach}} is to embed the higher-dimensional objects in three-dimensional space, using methods analogous {{to the ways in}} which three-dimensional objects are drawn on the plane. For example, the fold out nets mentioned in the previous section have higher-dimensional equivalents. Some of these may be viewed at [...] One might <b>even</b> <b>imagine</b> building a model of this fold-out net, as one draws a polyhedron's fold-out net on a piece of paper. Sadly, we could never do the necessary folding of the 3-dimensional structure to obtain the 4-dimensional polytope because of the constraints of the physical universe. Another way to [...] "draw" [...] the higher-dimensional shapes in 3 dimensions is via some kind of projection, for example, the analogue of either orthographic or perspective projection. Coxeter's famous book on polytopes (Coxeter, 1948) has some examples of such orthographic projections. Other examples may be found on the web (see for example [...] ). Note that immersing even 4-dimensional polychora directly into two dimensions is quite confusing. Easier to understand are 3-d models of the projections. Such models are occasionally found in science museums or mathematics departments of universities (such as that of the Université Libre de Bruxelles).|$|E

2500|$|In May 1962, the Tenth Panchen Lama sent Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai {{a report}} {{detailing}} {{the suffering of}} the Tibetan people, which became known as the 70,000 Character Petition. [...] "In many parts of Tibet people have starved to death.[...] [...] In some places, whole families have perished and the death rate is very high. This is very abnormal, horrible and grave," [...] according to the, a confidential report by [...] "In the past Tibet lived in a dark barbaric feudalism but there was never such a shortage of food, especially after Buddhism had spread....In Tibet from 1959 to 1961, for two years almost all animal husbandry and farming stopped. The nomads have no grain to eat and the farmers have no meat, butter or salt," [...] the report continued. [...] It was the opinion of the Panchen Lama that these deaths were a result of official policies, not of any natural disasters, which was the situation understood in Beijing by Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government. The Panchen Lama also described the uniqueness of the famine that Tibet suffered from: [...] "There was never such an event in the history of Tibet. People could not <b>even</b> <b>imagine</b> such horrible starvation in their dreams. In some areas if one person catches a cold, then it spreads to hundreds and large numbers simply die." [...] The destruction of most of Tibet's more than 6,000 monasteries happened between 1959 and 1961.|$|E
