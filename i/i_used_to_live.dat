I'll tell you exactly how I came to write that. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> on Galvez Street and my girlfriend and I liked {{to go down to}} the drug store and buy ice cream. One day we went in and saw this new flavor, Tutti Frutti. Right away I thought, 'Boy, that's a great idea for a song'. So I kept it in the back of my mind until I got to the studio that day. I also wrote the flip side of 'Tutti Frutti', 'I'm Just A Lonely Guy', and a spiritual, 'Blessed Mother', all in the same day." [...] LaBostrie was still receiving royalty checks on the average of $5,000 every three to six months from the song in the 1980s.|$|E

I've watched the show since I was about four years old, and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in a house that backed onto the EastEnders set so I used to watch them filming all the time.

But how just has it been, and how should all men reflect, that, when they compare their present conditions with others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the exchange, and be convinced of their former felicity, by their experience; I say, how just has it been, that the truly solitary life I reflected on in, an island of mere desolation should be my lot, who had so often unjustly compared it with the life which I then led, in which had I continued, I had in all probability been exceeding prosperous and rich.|$|R

6000|$|... "Hers is {{a strange}} story, Mr. Allan. I will tell you. You must know that all these {{mountains}} and the country beyond are full of baboons. When I was a girl of about ten <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> wander a great deal alone in the hills and valleys, and watch the baboons as they played among the rocks. There was one family of baboons that <b>I</b> watched especially--they <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in a kloof {{about a mile from}} the house. The old man baboon was very large, and one of the females had a grey face. But the reason why I watched them so much was because I saw that they had with them a creature that looked like a girl, for her skin was quite white, and, what was more, that she was protected from the weather when it happened to be cold by a fur belt of some sort, which was tied round her throat. The old baboons seemed to be especially fond of her, and would sit with their arms round her neck. For nearly a whole summer I watched this particular white-skinned baboon till at last my curiosity quite overmastered me. I noticed that, though she climbed about the cliffs with the other monkeys, at a certain hour a little before sundown they <b>used</b> <b>to</b> put her with one or two other much smaller ones into a little cave, while the family went off somewhere to get food, to the mealie fields, I suppose. Then I got an idea that I would catch this white baboon and bring it home. But of course I could not do this by myself, so I took a Hottentot--a very clever man when he was not drunk--who lived on the stead, into my confidence. He was called Hendrik, and was very fond of me; but for a long while he would not listen to my plan, because he said that the babyans would kill us. At last I bribed him with a knife that had four blades, and one afternoon we started, Hendrik carrying a stout sack made of hide, with a rope running through it so that the mouth could be drawn tight.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a longstanding}} {{historical}} and cultural relationship between Congo and Cuba via the slave trade and the ‘return’ of Cuban music to Africa, a relationship that has apparently been very scantily documented. It is acknowledged that Congolese roots are present in Cuban music {{but there is little}} musical analysis of the actual elements concerned. My contribution to existing research is to investigate what links, if any, exist between contemporary Congolese and Cuban music. I explore the relationship between Congolese and Cuban music through working with musicians from the two traditions, bringing them together in a band. Using performance as research methodology and working through the composition, rehearsal and performance process together {{we have been able to}} look in depth at details of our musical traditions. At previous BFE study days I have discussed some of the similarities that we have recognized in our music. One significant shared feature is a two part song structure, with an extended ‘dancing part’ ending the song. In his insightful writings on Congolese Popular Music, Rumba Rules (2008), Bob White cites this ‘unique’ two part song structure as central to the pan-African popularity of the music. I draw parallels between this and the structure of Cuban Son, demonstrating that the tight formula with open and improvised sections within the form, allows for exciting and engaging performance. In this presentation I will focus in detail on common ground within this dancing section, reflecting on the similarities and differences in creation of groove and presentation between the two styles. <b>I</b> intend <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>live</b> and recorded musical examples, scores and videos to illustrate my observations.
