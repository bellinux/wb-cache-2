40|$|The primary {{mechanism}} of action of the antibiotic <b>dihydrostreptomycin</b> is binding to and modifying {{the function of the}} bacterial ribosome, thus leading to decreased and aberrant translation of proteins; however, the routes by which it enters the bacterial cell are largely unknown.

The strain, P. aeruginosa PAO 2401 had increased resistance to all aminoglycosides tested but exhibited no change for other antibiotics. The mutation designated aglA (aminoglycoside resistance) was 50 % cotransducible with the 8 -min ilvB,C marker on the P. aeruginosa chromosome. It showed a marked reduction in cytochrome c 552 and nitrate reductase (Nar) {{and a change}} in terminal oxidase activity. Cytochrome c 552 is {{a component of the}} P. aeruginosa Nar. No changes in succinate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenases, ubiquinone content, Mg 2 +/Ca 2 + membrane adenosine triphosphatase, and energy coupling of electron transport to adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate synthesis were detected. Transport of gentamicin and <b>dihydrostreptomycin</b> was impaired in PAO 2401, but transport of proline, arginine, glutamine, glucose or the polyamine spermidine was not reduced. Ribosomes of PAO 2401, and PAO 503 bound <b>dihydrostreptomycin</b> equally well, and cell extracts did not inactivate gentamicin or <b>dihydrostreptomycin.</b> Strain PAO 2401 is resistant to gentamicin and <b>dihydrostreptomycin</b> because of impaired transport of these compounds.

40|$|The {{most serious}} side-effect of the widely used {{aminoglycoside}} antibiotics is irreversible intracellular {{damage to the}} auditory and vestibular hair cells of the inner ear. The mechanism of entry into the hair cells has not been unequivocally resolved. Here we report that extracellular <b>dihydrostreptomycin</b> not only blocks the mechano-electrical transducer channels of mouse outer hair cells at negative membrane potentials, as previously shown, but also enters the cells through these channels, which {{are located in the}} cells' mechanosensory hair bundles. The voltage-dependent blocking kinetics indicate an open-channel block mechanism, which can be well described by a two barrier¿one binding site model, quantifying the antibiotic's block of the channel as well as its permeation in terms of the associated rate constants. The results identify the open transducer channels as the main route for aminoglycoside entry. Intracellularly applied <b>dihydrostreptomycin</b> also blocks the transducer channels, but at positive membrane potentials. However, the potency of the block was two orders of magnitude lower than that due to extracellular <b>dihydrostreptomycin.</b> Extracellular Ca 2 + increases the free energy of the barrier nearest the extracellular side and of the binding site for <b>dihydrostreptomycin.</b> This reduces both the entry of <b>dihydrostreptomycin</b> into the channel and the channel's affinity for the drug. In vivo, where the extracellular Ca 2 + concentration in the endolymph surrounding the hair bundles is < 100 µM, we predict that some 9000 <b>dihydrostreptomycin</b> molecules per second enter each hair cell at therapeutic drug concentrations...|$|E

In addition, a thin, single seeded assay layer was used to maximize diffusion. Levels of <b>dihydrostreptomycin</b> as low as 0. 06 microgram/ml in milk and 0. 2 to 0. 4 microgram/g in cheeses were measurable; these levels were some fourfold more sensitive than those presently recommended by the Food and Drug Administration...|$|E
