5|$|Parallel-coupled {{lines is}} another popular {{topology}} for printed boards, for which open-circuit lines are the simplest to implement since the manufacturing consists of {{nothing more than}} the printed track. The design consists of a row of parallel λ/2 resonators, but coupling over only λ/4 to each of the neighbouring resonators, so forming a staggered line as shown in figure 9. Wider fractional bandwidths are possible with this filter than with the capacitive <b>gap</b> <b>filter,</b> but a similar problem arises on printed boards as dielectric loss reduces the Q. Lower-Q lines require tighter coupling and smaller gaps between them which is limited by the accuracy of the printing process. One solution to this problem is to print the track on multiple layers with adjacent lines overlapping but not in contact because they are on different layers. In this way, the lines can be coupled across their width, which results in much stronger coupling than when they are edge-to-edge, and a larger gap becomes possible for the same performance. For other (non-printed) technologies, short-circuit lines may be preferred since the short-circuit provides a mechanical attachment point for the line and Q-reducing dielectric insulators are not required for mechanical support. Other than for mechanical and assembly reasons, there is little preference for open-circuit over short-circuit coupled lines. Both structures can realize the same range of filter implementations with the same electrical performance. Both types of parallel-coupled filters, in theory, do not have spurious passbands at twice the centre frequency as seen in many other filter topologies (e.g., stubs). However, suppression of this spurious passband requires perfect tuning of the coupled lines which is not realized in practice, so there is inevitably some residual spurious passband at this frequency.|$|E

The crank and shaft pins of the crankshaft are heat-hardened. Due to the air-cooling of the engine, the cylinders have cooling fins made of centrifugal cast metal. The combustion chamber of the engine {{is a part of}} the piston bowls because of the direct injection. The pistons are made of a special highly heat resistant light metal alloy, they have three piston rings and one oil control ring. The connecting rods are cranked as well as the lower crank ends.

The overhead valves are pushed by rockers and pushrods. The cylinder head {{is a single}} piece made of low pressure chill cast highly heat resistant light metal alloy. The air filter of the engine is a wet filter. For dusty environments MWM offered an oil bath air filter. The air intake must not draw in hot air; this would reduce the engine power output. The fuel is pumped by a Bosch pump. The fuel pump is controlled by a centrifugal control mechanism using a pushrod. The control trap makes it possible to change the injection time at the engine start-up to pump more fuel into the cylinder. A forced feed lubrication system lubricates the engine, powered by a gear oil pump. The oil is filtered by a strainer in the low pressure circuit and a fine sieve strainer in the high pressure circuit. A <b>gap</b> <b>filter</b> in the high pressure circuit was also available. The cooling is done by an axial cooling fan powered by the crankshaft using a belt. The power can be taken off the flywheel or the PTO-shaft.

In this case, each pair of parallel-coupled lines is connected to the next pair by a short link. The [...] "U" [...] shapes so formed give rise to the name hairpin filter. In some designs the link can be longer, giving a wide hairpin with λ/4 impedance transformer action between sections. The angled bends seen in figure 10 are common to stripline designs and represent a compromise between a sharp right angle, which produces a large discontinuity, and a smooth bend, which takes up more board area which can be severely limited in some products. Such bends are often seen in long stubs where they could not otherwise be fitted into the space available. The lumped-element equivalent circuit of this kind of discontinuity is similar to a stepped-impedance discontinuity.

I understand that my thesis may be made electronically available to the public. ii This thesis presents {{the design of a}} two-dimensional phononic band gap crystal simulator, and phononic crystal analysis. Phononic crystals and their application to microwave acoustic filters are studied. Wave mechanics is introduced. A two-dimensional phononic crystal simulator is developed. Simulator operation is validated through comparison with published data. Design parameters for phononic crystal band gap engineering are outlined. Digital signal processing and wave mechanics are utilized to analyze fractal and circular inclusion based phononic crystals. Topics for further study are given. Phononic crystal band structure is found to be sensitive to inclusion boundary geometry. Fractal inclusion based crystals provide multiple pass band characteris-tics. The evolution of a fractal inclusion in a phononic crystal may cause band gap widening and the formation of new band gaps. Circular inclusion based phononic crystals have piecewise-linear phase characteristics and quality factors up to 600. iii Acknowledgments I would like to recognize Professor John Starr Hamel for his inventiveness in com-bining the disciplines of microwave acoustic filter engineering, phononic band gap crystal engineering, and micro-electro-mechanical-system engineering to create the novel class of filtering devices known as silicon integrated phononic band gap filters.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{there has}} been a surge of {{interest}} in <b>gapped</b> q-gram <b>filters</b> for approximate string matching. Important design parameters for filters are for example the value of q, the filter-threshold and in particular the shape (aka seed) of the filter. A good choice of parameters can improve the performance of a q-gram filter by orders of magnitude and optimising these parameters is a nontrivial combinatorial problem. We describe a new method for analysing <b>gapped</b> q-gram <b>filters.</b> This method is simple and generic. It applies to a variety of filters, overcomes many restrictions that are present in existing algorithms and can easily be extended to new filter variants. To implement our approach, we use an extended version of BDDs (Binary Decision Diagrams), a data structure that efficiently represents sets of bit-strings. In a second step, we define a new class of multi-shape filters and analyse these filters with the BDD-based approach. Experiments show that multi-shape filters can outperform the best single-shape filters, which are currently in use, in many aspects. The BDD-based algorithm is crucial for the design and analysis of these new and better multi-shape filters. Our results apply to the k-mismatches problem, i. e. approximate string matching with Hamming distance. ...|$|R

Motivated by better quality and continuity of the series AAM (NCEP) Reanalysis, the problem of the seasonal imbalances in the solid Earth-atmosphere axial angular momentum budget is re-examined. To assess better the estimates of the annual and semiannual oscillations in LOD and AAM and of the residual oscillations derived as difference series between LOD and AAM, the series of LOD data from three analysis centers (IERS, GFZ, JPL) and of AAM data in terms of #chi#_ 3 (W), #chi#_ 3 (P) and #chi#_ 3 (P+IB) from four meteorological centers (NCEP, JMA, ECMWF and UKMO) are used.

40|$|By {{carrying}} out two-dimensional two-fluid global simulations, we {{have studied the}} response of dust to gap formation by a single planet in the gaseous component of a protoplanetary disk - the so-called "dust filtration" mechanism. We have found that a gap opened by a giant planet at 20 AU in a α= 0. 01, Ṁ= 10 ^- 8 Msun/yr disk can effectively stop dust particles larger than 0. 1 mm drifting inwards, leaving a sub-millimeter dust cavity/hole. However, smaller particles are difficult to filter by a planet-induced gap due to 1) dust diffusion, and 2) a high gas accretion velocity at the gap edge. An analytic model is also derived to understand what size particles can be <b>filtered</b> by the <b>gap</b> edge. Finally, with our updated understanding of dust filtration, we have computed Monte-Carlo radiative transfer models with variable dust size distributions to generate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of disks with gaps. By comparing with transitional disk observations (e. g. GM Aur), {{we have found that}} dust filtration alone has difficulties to deplete small particles sufficiently to explain the near-IR deficit of transitional disks, except under some extreme circumstances. The scenario of gap opening by multiple planets studied previously suffers the same difficulty. One possible solution is by invoking both dust filtration and dust growth in the inner disk. In this scenario, a planet induced <b>gap</b> <b>filters</b> large dust particles in the disk, and the remaining small dust particles passing to the inner disk can grow efficiently without replenishment from fragmentation of large grains. Predictions for ALMA have also been made based on all these scenarios. We conclude that dust filtration with planet(s) in the disk is a promising mechanism to explain submm observations of transitional disks but it may need to be combined with other processes (e. g. dust growth) to explain the near-IR deficit.

50|$|As {{part of its}} {{marketing}} effort, ISM has also taken the sub-competencies and aligned them with its educational and training products to help supply management professionals close their skill <b>gaps.</b> Users can <b>filter</b> available learning products based on the applicable experience level in which they need to achieve mastery. For those studying for an ISM certification, such as the Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM) or Certified Professional in Supplier Diversity (CPSD), the model identifies specific locations in ISM’s examination study guides where relevant information is found.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{modification}} of the filtered importance sampling method, and improves the quality of virtual spherical Gaussian light (VSGL)-based real-time glossy indirect illumination using this modification. The original filtered importance sampling method produces large overlaps of and <b>gaps</b> between <b>filtering</b> kernels for high-frequency probability density functions (PDFs). This is because {{the size of the}} filtering kernel is determined using the PDF at the sampled center of the kernel. To reduce those overlaps and gaps, this paper determines the kernel size using the integral of the PDF within the filtering kernel. Our key insight is that these integrals are approximately constant, if kernel centers are sampled using stratified sampling. Therefore, an appropriate kernel size can be obtained by solving this integral equation. Using the proposed kernel size for filtered importance sampling-based VSGL generation, undesirable artifacts are significantly reduced with a negligibly small overhead.|$|R
