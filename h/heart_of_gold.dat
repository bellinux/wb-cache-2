Matte paintings throughout the series were created by Jean Peyre. Music and sound effects were by Paddy Kingsland, {{with the exception of the}} theme music; the familiar Journey of the Sorcerer theme by Bernie Leadon was used again, in the arrangement by Tim Souster that had previously been used for the Hitchhiker's LP. Video effects using the Quantel system were done by Dave Jervis. Other puppets, including insects seen in Episode 5, were designed by Susan Moore. Some of the actual puppeteering was done by Stuart Murdoch, including operating parts of the Dish of the Day animal.|$|E

500|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} for the episode, Gilligan {{revealed that}} he wrote {{the character of the}} genie, Jenn, with Janeane Garofalo in mind, but she was unavailable at the time of filming. However, he was ultimately very pleased with Paula Sorge's performance, stating [...] "In fact, she was even better than how I had written the character. In Paula's audition, she came off like a world-weary wise-ass who was not only tough and smart, but had a <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold.</b> She made it a really fun character." [...] The casting process to find an actress for the part took so long that an idea Gilligan had to give the character double pupils had to be scrapped when the production team ran out of time to source them. Instead, she wore contacts over her already blue eyes to make them brighter, and a blue jewel on her cheekbone.|$|E

500|$|According to {{film critic}} Roger Ebert, Susie adheres to the Hollywood {{tradition}} of being {{depicted as a}} hooker with a <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold,</b> while her tough demeanor {{is little more than}} an act. Matt Brunson of Creative Loafing described Susie as a [...] "tough-talking, street-smart" [...] character who is [...] "always ready with a quip (or a sharp counter to a quip)." [...] Writing for The Daily Beast, Elizabeth Kaye identified Susie as [...] "a woman who must battle to keep her emotions from showing". Film Quarterlys Steve Vineberg wrote that the character boasts [...] "a cannily concealed underlayer of childlike dreaminess," [...] comparing her appearance and wardrobe to that of singer Ricky Lee Jones. Wounded by life, Susie wears an [...] "armor" [...] that is both impenetrable yet makes others want to experience more of the character. Kaye felt that the role was especially poignant for Pfeiffer, who in real life had still been recovering from an affair with actor John Malkovich {{at the same time she}} was filming The Fabulous Baker Boys. According to Cinapse's Frank Cavillo, Pfeiffer [...] "had never been as open or vulnerable on screen until starring in The Fabulous Baker Boys." ...|$|E

500|$|Levi's {{performance}} has garnered widespread acclaim from critics, who enjoyed the actor's comedic delivery and singing voice. Praising the directors' decision to [...] " [...] big-name stars {{in favor of}} lesser-known talent", TV Guide described Levi's performance as [...] "charming, roguish, and, well, generic enough". Similarly, Mike Scott of The Times-Picayune wrote that Levi [...] "comes off as an exaggerated, narcissistic version of the rascally Tory Belleci from TV's MythBusters", complimenting the fact that [...] "the cast's names are less than household stature". Rafer Guzman of Newsday described Levi's performance as [...] "terrific". ABC Online appreciated the fact that [...] "the voices of the hero and heroine were not recognisable", concluding, [...] "Zachary Levi and Mandy Moore ... do {{a really good job}} on the voices". Dustin Hucks of Film School Rejects wrote that Levi [...] "creates a significant amount of range and emotion with his voice that truly makes the suave thief with a <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> Flynn pop on the screen". Hucks went on to call Flynn [...] "one the better [...] that have come out of the Disney stable in quite a while". Mathew DeKinder of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch appreciated the comedy in Levi's [...] "quick-tongued delivery", while Rolling StonesPeter Travers wrote that the actor [...] "does a nice job" [...] as Flynn. James Luxford of The National wrote that both Levi and Moore [...] "adeptly flesh out what could have been basic characters", while Digital Spys Simon Reynolds described Levi as [...] "excellent as the rogueish hero". Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger called Levi [...] "a surprisingly perfect choice for the self-mocking Flynn". Also pleasantly surprised, David Nusair of About.com wrote that [...] "Levi effortlessly captures the character's transformation from a vain (yet charismatic) rogue to a compassionate love interest". Praising the actor's singing voice, Jim Vejvoda of IGN described it as [...] "impressive".|$|E
