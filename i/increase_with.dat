30|$|Besides, the HTC ratio <b>increases</b> <b>with</b> <b>increasing</b> {{heat flux}} at all {{operating}} temperatures. This {{effect can be}} explained by the Brownian motion, and the thermophoresis effect [28]. The thermophoresis effect holds that nanoparticles can diffuse under the effect of a temperature gradient. The diffusion <b>increases</b> <b>with</b> <b>increasing</b> temperature gradient. In the boiling heat transfer, a great temperature gradient exists for the nanofluid near the heated surface. It <b>increases</b> <b>with</b> <b>increasing</b> heat flux and correspondingly increases the diffusion of nanoparticles, and hence the heat transfer is enhanced. Meanwhile, higher temperature leads to stronger Brownian motion, which also enhances the energy transportation. Therefore, the HTC enhancement <b>increases</b> <b>with</b> <b>increasing</b> heat flux.|$|R

5|$|The idea {{of group}} living has been {{discussed}} by many evolutionists for its costs and benefits. Alexander predicted that the cost to large groups {{is that they are}} more likely to suffer from parasitism, but at the same time, they benefit by defense against predation. This theory is not supported in the case of P.exclamans because the parasitism does not always <b>increase</b> <b>with</b> nest size and the predation rate was independent of size.|$|E
5|$|The new SuperSpeed mode {{provides}} a {{data signaling rate}} of 5.0Gbit/s. However, due to the overhead incurred by 8b/10b encoding, the payload throughput is actually 4Gbit/s, and the specification considers it reasonable to achieve only around 3.2Gbit/s (0.4GB/s or 400MB/s). However, this should <b>increase</b> <b>with</b> future hardware advances. Communication is full-duplex in SuperSpeed transfer mode; earlier modes are half-duplex, arbitrated by the host.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 {{study by}} Milan Ćirković and colleagues {{extended}} {{the notion of}} a time-dependent galactic habitable zone, analyzing various catastrophic events as well as the underlying secular evolution of galactic dynamics. The paper considers that the number of habitable planets may fluctuate wildly with time due to the unpredictable timing of catastrophic events, thereby creating a punctuated equilibrium in which habitable planets are more likely at some times than at others. Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulations on a toy model of the Milky Way, the team found that the number of habitable planets is likely to <b>increase</b> <b>with</b> time, though not in a perfectly linear pattern.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{cross-sections}} {{of these}} fusion-evaporation reactions <b>increase</b> <b>with</b> the asymmetry of the reaction, titanium {{would be a}} better projectile than chromium for the synthesis of element 121. This necessitates an einsteinium target, since titanium has 22 protons and the remaining 99 must be supplied by the target, and einsteinium is element 99. This poses severe challenges due to the significant heating and damage of the target due to the high radioactivity of einsteinium-254, but it would probably be the most promising approach to element 119 with 48Ca beams and possibly element 121 with 50Ti beams. It would also require working on a smaller scale due to the lower amount of 254Es that can be produced. This small-scale work could in the near future only be carried out in Dubna's SHE-factory.|$|E
5|$|Dementia, and {{specifically}} Alzheimer's disease, may {{be among the}} most costly diseases for society in Europe and the United States, while their costs in other countries such as Argentina, and South Korea, are also high and rising. These costs will probably <b>increase</b> <b>with</b> the ageing of society, becoming an important social problem. AD-associated costs include direct medical costs such as nursing home care, direct nonmedical costs such as in-home day care, and indirect costs such as lost productivity of both patient and caregiver. Numbers vary between studies but dementia costs worldwide have been calculated around $160billion, while costs of Alzheimer's disease in the United States may be $100billion each year.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{blood lead}} levels {{steadily}} <b>increase</b> <b>with</b> increasing age. In adults of all ages, men have higher blood lead levels than women do. Children {{are more sensitive}} to elevated blood lead levels than adults are. Children may also have a higher intake of lead than adults; they breathe faster and {{may be more likely}} to have contact with and ingest soil. Children of ages one to three tend to have the highest blood lead levels, possibly because at that age they begin to walk and explore their environment, and they use their mouths in their exploration. Blood levels usually peak at about 18–24months old. In many countries including the US, household paint and dust are the major route of exposure in children.|$|E

In a study of impala in South Africa, the number of worms in juveniles showed an <b>increase</b> <b>with</b> age, reaching a peak when impala turned a year old. This study recorded worms of genera such as Cooperia, Cooperoides, Fasciola, Gongylonema. Haemonchus, Impalaia, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus; some of these showed seasonal variations in density.|$|E
5|$|Resistivity is {{a measure}} of how {{strongly}} a material opposes the flow of electric current. The resistivity of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal, and it gets even higher with lower temperatures, which is unusual for metals. This trend continues down to 100K, below which resistivity rapidly decreases for fresh samples. Resistivity then begins to <b>increase</b> <b>with</b> time at around 20K due to radiation damage, with the rate dictated by the isotopic composition of the sample.|$|E

5|$|Some {{conformation}} flaws {{common in}} the breed that may hinder a trotter's success include a heavy forehand and overangulated hind legs. Another problem that affects some Finnhorses {{is a tendency to}} trot with the front and hind legs directly in line with other, which creates a high probability of forging, where the hind hooves hit the front pasterns, which can cause breaking gait. This can be helped to a degree with careful shoeing. There is also a tendency toward ossification of the hoof cartilages of the front feet, which tends to <b>increase</b> <b>with</b> age, and appears to be heritable. This condition, called sidebone when it affects the lateral and medial cartilages of the foot, is common in draught breeds. However, a study of affected Finnhorses also noted that horses with long toes and low heels were common and ossification correlated with the length of the heels.|$|E
