500|$|All {{of these}} new things {{entering}} my life are changing the way I view my purpose, but 'Dance in the Dark' in particular is about me wanting to liveâ€”but also, the song isn't called 'Dance in the Light'. I'm not a gospel singer trying to cross people over. What I'm saying is, 'I get it. I feel you, I feel the same way, and it's OK.' I <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> I can inspire some sort of change in people subliminally through the show. They're singing 'Dance in the Dark,' but they're dancing and they're free, they're letting it out. But the songs are not about freedom, they're about [...] I get it. I feel the way you feel.|$|E
2500|$|On July 14, 2009, the Episcopal Church's House of Bishops voted that [...] "any ordained ministry" [...] {{is open to}} gay men and lesbians. The New York Times {{said the}} move was [...] "likely to send shockwaves through the Anglican Communion." [...] This vote ended a {{moratorium}} on ordaining gay bishops passed in 2006 and passed in spite of Archbishop Rowan Williams's personal call {{at the start of}} the convention that, [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> there won't be decisions in the coming days that will push us further apart." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{president}} of the Independent Democrats, Patricia de Lille, told the court she was handed information by people whose identity she did not disclose. She first asked for a commission of inquiry into the arms deal. When that was refused she asked Mbeki to issue a proclamation to allow the Heath unit to investigate. She said that her [...] "role was {{to pass on the}} information and <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> it will be investigated. I was ostracised, but I did it {{for the people of the}} country. I wanted to assist government to root out the few bad apples." [...] She was accused by Van Zyl of using the arms deal to attack the ANC, but she retorted that her [...] "attack was on corruption." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was a sad}} {{time for}} the whole nation, and men and women watched the bulletins eagerly, <b>hoping</b> <b>and</b> <b>praying</b> <b>that</b> President McKinley might recover. Every hour there was some slight change, and people would talk it over in a whisper.|$|R
6000|$|... "Read him, Monsieur? There {{is scarce}} {{a line in}} all his 'Discourses' that I do not know by heart, and that I do not treasure, vaguely <b>hoping</b> <b>and</b> <b>praying</b> <b>that</b> some day such a state as he dreamt of may find itself established, and may sweep aside these corrupt, tyrannical conditions." ...|$|R
2500|$|Gasparri {{approached}} Ratti before voting {{began on}} the third day and told him he would urge his supporters to switch their votes to Ratti, who was shocked to hear this. When it became clear that neither Gasparri nor del Val could win, the cardinals approached Ratti, thinking him a compromise candidate not identified with either faction. Cardinal Gaetano de Lai approached Ratti and was believed to have said: [...] "We will vote for Your Eminence if Your Eminence will promise that you will not choose Cardinal Gasparri as your secretary of state". Ratti is said to have responded: [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> among so highly deserving cardinals the Holy Spirit selects someone else. If I am chosen, it is indeed Cardinal Gasparri whom I will take to be my secretary of state".|$|E
2500|$|The same General Convention also voted that [...] "any ordained ministry" [...] {{is open to}} gay men and lesbians. The New York Times {{said the}} move was [...] "likely to send shockwaves through the Anglican Communion." [...] This vote ended a {{moratorium}} on ordaining gay bishops passed in 2006 and passed in spite of Archbishop Rowan Williams's personal call {{at the start of}} the convention that, [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> there won't be decisions in the coming days that will push us further apart." [...] A noted Evangelical scholar of the New Testament, N.T. Wright, who is also Bishop of Durham in the Church of England, wrote in The Times (London) that the vote [...] "marks a clear break with the rest of the Anglican Communion" [...] and formalizes the Anglican schism. [...] However, in another resolution the Convention voted to [...] "reaffirm the continued participation" [...] and [...] "reaffirm the abiding commitment" [...] of the Episcopal Church with Anglican Communion.|$|E

6000|$|A man was {{lingering}} {{along the}} public path {{on the other}} side of the river; she fancied she knew the form. Her resolutions, taken in the presence of Owen, did not fail her now. She <b>hoped</b> <b>and</b> <b>prayed</b> <b>that</b> it might not be one who had stolen her heart away, and still kept it. Why should he have reappeared at all, when he had declared that he went out of her sight for ever? ...|$|R
5000|$|The song's lyrics {{describe}} {{the thoughts and}} feelings {{of a man who}} is in a one-way relationship: He has a girlfriend, but she does not love him and only stays in the relationship for appearances, a fact of which he is painfully aware. He <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> <b>prays</b> <b>that,</b> {{at some point in the}} future, the woman whom he is in love with will return his love, but laments that, at present, [...] "it's only make believe." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{said that}} the Managing Committee of the temple would in all {{probability}} bring a criminal action against us for insulting their religion. There was {{a section of the}} Indian Penal Code which exactly met Fleete's offence. Strickland said he only <b>hoped</b> <b>and</b> <b>prayed</b> <b>that</b> they would do this. Before I left I looked into Fleete's room, and saw him lying on his right side, scratching his left breast. Then. I went to bed cold, depressed, and unhappy, at seven o'clock in the morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is better}} than he was, dear, and we must <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> he will soon be well again; but at present you must not speak to him. He must be kept very quiet and not allowed to talk." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. H. I <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> {{it may be}} so; but I {{am afraid}} that it goes deeper than you imagine. Still, I see hope in her extreme unhappiness, and in the remembrance of your dear mother's last words and prayers.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good evening, mother,' Ronald replied, in {{his natural}} voice. 'Miss Briggs, {{will you come}} with me? I'm very sorry that this unhappy scene should have been inflicted upon you against my will; but I <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> you won't have lost all {{confidence}} in my wish to help you, {{in spite of these}} unfortunate accidents.' ...|$|E
60|$|At any rate, {{there were}} a few {{faithful}} little women in the grand stand--Milly and Nan and Rose Stringer and Kate Bogart--who sat with compressed lips <b>and</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>and</b> <b>prayed</b> for <b>that</b> game to begin and end.|$|R
60|$|Had he {{given up}} the fight? Cynthia fervently <b>hoped</b> <b>and</b> <b>prayed</b> <b>that</b> he had, but she <b>hoped</b> <b>and</b> <b>prayed</b> in silence. Well she knew, if the event in the tannery shed had not made him abandon his affairs, no appeal could do so. Her happiest days in this period were the Saturdays and Sundays spent with him in Coniston, and as the weeks went by she began {{to believe that the}} change, miraculous as it seemed, had indeed taken place. He had given up his power. It was a {{pleasure}} that made the weeks bearable for her. What did it matter--whether he had made the sacrifice {{for the sake of his}} love for her? He had made it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I could {{forgive him}} {{doing what he}} does if he didn't seem to enjoy it," [...] said the senior churchwarden. [...] "But, as you say, dear, he is going, <b>and</b> all I <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> is <b>that</b> we never see his like again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{traveled}} all night," [...] she said, half closing her eyes. [...] "Directly I {{saw that it}} was my duty, I came here without waiting a single second. I shall lie down and rest and hope, Julien, until I see you both. I shall <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> you will bring Anne here to luncheon with me and that we shall have a little family gathering." ...|$|E
60|$|Does this seem {{to you a}} small difference? A fine-drawn {{question}} of words? Is it, then, a small difference whether I say to my fellow- man, I <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> you may be stricken with disease, or whether I say, You are stricken with disease, whether you know it or not. I warn you of it, and I warn {{you to go to}} the physician? For so great, and no less, is the difference.|$|E
6000|$|... "Monseigneur," [...] he ended, [...] "knowing what danger awaited {{you along}} the road, I have sat up all night, praying God and His saints {{that you might}} come this far, and that thus I might warn you. Had I been less bruised and sore, I had got myself a horse and ridden out to meet you; as it was, I could but <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> you would reach Blagnac, and that--" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 5 March in the Royal Marsden Hospital, Goody {{asked to}} be baptised; two days later, she and her sons were christened. Clifford {{confirmed}} that this was her last public appearance, and she had already said her goodbyes to her family: [...] "We're <b>hoping</b> <b>and</b> <b>praying</b> <b>that</b> Jade pulls through, {{but the fact of}} the matter is that she now only has a short time to live." [...] He confirmed that during the next 24 hours her doctors could assess how long Goody had to live, but she had a very short time left in any case. Jack Tweed was allowed to extend his curfew, spending a last night with his wife before she said goodbye to the rest of her family.|$|R
5000|$|Williams {{said about}} the song (when he was at RTL Late Night on 2 November 2016): [...] "Angels is a song that myself and Guy Chambers wrote {{and it was the}} first of our songs that we wrote together. We could tell <b>and</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>and</b> <b>prayed</b> <b>that</b> we got {{something}} incredibly special. After we wrote the song, Guy got very ill, straight away. I kind of walked back from his house to my flat in the cold and in the snow with this tape in my hand and about a mile and a half in, I hailed a cab down. He played it and said [...] "that is great, that is, Robbie, that is gonne be number 1", and you know what: it never was number one.|$|R
60|$|Then {{it would}} be over, {{one way or the}} other. Besides, and this was strange and opportune enough, never had he felt so deeply and truly {{attracted}} to Mary. Whether it was because her soft, indolent beauty showed at its best this evening in that gown and setting, or because her conversation, with its sub-acid tinge of kindly humour amused him, or--and this seemed more probable--because her whole attitude towards himself was so gentle and so full of sweet benevolence, he could not say. At any rate, this remained true, she attracted him more than any woman he had ever met, <b>and</b> sincerely he <b>hoped</b> <b>and</b> <b>prayed</b> <b>that</b> when he asked her to be his wife she might find it in her heart to say Yes.|$|R
6000|$|... "They tell me Milton {{could not}} get along with his wife, and Shakespeare {{was no more than}} respectable by times. As for the Bible, of course things were {{different}} in those sacred days-- although I never had a high opinion of King David, say what you will. I never knew any good to come of writing poetry, and I <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> blessed boy will outgrow the tendency. If he does not--we must see what emulsion of cod-liver oil will do." ...|$|E
60|$|MADAM: The Committee of the Glasgow University Abstainers' Society, {{representing}} {{nearly one}} hundred students, embrace the opportunity {{which you have}} so kindly afforded them, of expressing their high esteem for you, and their appreciation of your noble efforts in behalf of the oppressed.

6000|$|... "I doubt thee not, {{my young}} friend," [...] said Bridgenorth; [...] "and I trust {{to see that}} name rank high amongst those by whom the prey shall be rent from the mighty. At present, thy prejudices occupy thy mind like the strong keeper of the house {{mentioned}} in Scripture.

50|$|After {{the murder}} of his wife, and his son's kidnapping, Dr. Vidya Bhushan decides to devote {{the rest of his life}} as a Poojary, living on the {{premises}} of a princely-donated temple, <b>hoping</b> <b>and</b> <b>praying</b> <b>that</b> one day he will be reunited with his estranged son. One day a wounded bandit named Sher Singh comes to him for protection, and he not only shields the man from the police, but also tends to his wounds, and lies to the townspeople that the man's name is Amrit, When Amrit recovers, he is grateful to Vidya for looking after him, and he falls in love with a town belle by the name of Shalu. What Vidya does not know that is that Amrit is really interested in the gold and jewellery hidden in a secret underground chamber below the temple; and what Amrit does not know is Shalu is seeking vengeance against Sher Singh for killing her father.|$|R
6000|$|You see, Robert {{might go}} to stay till Mr. Edward Kenyon arrives--if it were only till then. I still <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> our dearest friend may rally, to recover at least a {{tolerable}} degree of health. He has certain good symptoms; {{and some of the}} bad ones, such as the wandering, &c., are constitutional with him under the least fever. You may suppose what painful anxiety we are in about him. Oh, he has been always so good to me--so true, sympathising, and generous a friend! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> {{dear old}} George {{may be the}} first of such a band of fellow-workers. Others--Henry Tagalana, who is, I suppose, about eighteen, Fisher Pantatun, about twenty-one, Edward Wogale (George's own brother), about sixteen, Robert Pantatun, about eighteen--are excellent, all that I could wish; and many younger ones are coming up. They stay with us voluntarily two or three years now without any going home, and the little ones read and write {{surprisingly}} well. They come to me very often and say, [...] " [...] Bishop, I wish to stop here again this winter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It grieves me to {{find you}} in this {{negative}} state," [...] she returned, [...] "and I can only <b>hope</b> <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> you will not always continue in it. You do not deny the truth of Christianity, you say; but tell me, putting aside all that men say for and against our holy faith, and the arguments that have pulled you this way and that, is there not something in your own soul that tells {{you that you are}} not here by chance, that there is an Unseen Power that gave us life, and that it is good for us, even here in this short existence, if we do that which is pleasing to Him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the course}} of my rambles I met sundry natives whom I had known in the old days, some of them a long while ago. They all seemed glad to see me and were quite ready to talk of past times, but of the present they would say little or nothing, except that they were certain there would be war. Of Anscombe and Heda I could hear nothing, and indeed did not dare to make any direct {{inquiries}} concerning them, but several reliable men assured me that the last missionaries and traders having departed, there was not a white man, woman or child left in Zululand except myself. It was [...] "all black" [...] they said, referring to the colour of their people, as it had been before the time of Chaka. So I was forced to eat out my heart with anxiety in silence, <b>hoping</b> <b>and</b> <b>praying</b> <b>that</b> Zikali had played an honest part and sent them away safely.|$|R
60|$|DEAR JOE, Well, it's all right, anyway. Diplomacy couldn't {{have saved}} it--{{diplomacy}} of mine--at that late day. I hadn't any diplomacy in stock, anyway. In {{order to meet}} Jones's requirements I had to surrender the old contract (a contract which made me boss {{of the situation and}} gave me the whip-hand of Paige) and allow the new one to be drafted and put in its place. I was running an immense risk, but it was justified by Jones's promises--promises made to me not merely once but every time I tallied with him. When February arrived, I saw signs which were mighty plain reading. Signs which meant <b>that</b> Paige was <b>hoping</b> <b>and</b> <b>praying</b> <b>that</b> Jones would go back on me--which would leave Paige boss, and me robbed and out in the cold. His prayers were answered, and I am out in the cold. If I ever get back my nine-twentieths interest, it will be by law-suit--which will be instituted in the indefinite future, when the time comes.|$|R
500|$|Chotiner {{had worked}} on Warren's 1942 campaign, but had parted ways from him, and the popular {{governor}} {{did not want to}} be connected to the Nixon campaign. Nonetheless, Chotiner sought to maneuver him into an endorsement. Chotiner instructed Young Republicans head and future congressman Joseph F. Holt to follow Douglas from appearance to appearance and demand to know who she was supporting for governor, as other Young Republicans handed out copies of the Pink Sheet. Douglas repeatedly avoided the question, but with four days to go before the election and the Democratic candidate near exhaustion from the bitter campaign, she responded <b>that</b> she <b>hoped</b> <b>and</b> <b>prayed</b> <b>that</b> Roosevelt would be elected. Holt contacted a delighted Chotiner, who had a reporter ask Warren about Douglas's comments, and the governor responded, [...] "In view of her statement, I might ask her how she expects I will vote when I mark my ballot for United States senator on Tuesday." [...] Chotiner publicized this response as an endorsement of Nixon, and the campaign assured voters that Nixon would be voting for Warren as well.|$|R
