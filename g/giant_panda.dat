5|$|In modern Chinese, the {{red panda}} is called xiăoxióngmāo (/, lesser or small panda), or / (hóngxióngmāo, red panda). In contrast, the <b>giant</b> <b>panda</b> is called dàxióngmāo (/, giant or big panda), or simply xióngmāo (/, panda, {{literally}} bear-cat).|$|E
5|$|Like the <b>giant</b> <b>panda,</b> they cannot digest cellulose, so {{they must}} consume a large volume of bamboo to survive. Their diets consist of about two-thirds bamboo, but they also eat mushrooms, roots, acorns, lichens, and grasses. Occasionally, they {{supplement}} their diets with fish and insects. They {{do little more than}} eat and sleep due to their low-calorie diets.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of extant bear {{species is}} shown in a cladogram based on complete mitochondrial DNA sequences from Yu et al., 2007. The <b>giant</b> <b>panda,</b> followed by the spectacled bear are clearly the oldest species. The relationships of the other species are not very well resolved, though the polar bear and the brown bear form a close grouping.|$|E

5|$|The {{red panda}} is {{specialized}} as a bamboo feeder with strong, curved and sharp semi-retractile claws standing inward for grasping narrow tree branches, leaves, and fruit. Like the <b>giant</b> <b>panda,</b> {{it has a}} “false thumb” which {{is an extension of}} the wrist bone. When descending a tree head-first, the red panda rotates its ankle to control its descent, one of the few climbing species to do so.|$|E
5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous <b>giant</b> <b>panda</b> still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must {{spend much of their}} time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E
5|$|The {{red panda}} {{is the only}} living species of the genus Ailurus and the family Ailuridae. It has been {{previously}} placed in the raccoon and bear families, but the results of phylogenetic analysis provide strong support for its taxonomic classification in its own family, Ailuridae, {{which is part of}} the superfamily Musteloidea along with the weasel, raccoon and skunk families. Two subspecies are recognized. It is not closely related to the <b>giant</b> <b>panda,</b> which is a basal ursid.|$|E

5|$|Most {{bears are}} {{opportunistic}} omnivores and consume more plant than animal matter. They eat anything from leaves, roots, and berries to insects, carrion, fresh meat, and fish, and have digestive systems and teeth adapted {{to such a}} diet. At the extremes are the almost entirely herbivorous <b>giant</b> <b>panda</b> and the mostly carnivorous polar bear. However, all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available. For example, Asiatic black bears in Taiwan consume large numbers of acorns when these are most common, and switch to ungulates at other times of the year.|$|E

5|$|The {{red panda}} is {{considered}} a living fossil and only distantly related to the <b>giant</b> <b>panda</b> (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), as it is naturally {{more closely related to}} {{the other members of the}} superfamily Musteloidea to which it belongs. The common ancestor of both pandas (which also was an ancestor for all living bears; pinnipeds like seals and walruses; and members of the family Musteloidea like weasels and otters) can be traced back to the Early Tertiary period tens of millions of years ago, with a wide distribution across Eurasia.|$|E

30|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>pandas</b> {{primarily}} feed {{on young}} bamboo shoots (Hu 2001; Zhang et al. 2009), and young bamboo provides high-quality food for <b>giant</b> <b>pandas.</b> This research confirms that proportions of young bamboo at both forage and non-forage sites were all {{significantly lower than}} that at control sites. Furthermore, no {{significant difference was found}} between forage and non-forage sites, which indicates that <b>giant</b> <b>pandas</b> would need to leave their current use plots when the proportion of young bamboo falls below average in the environment and search for sites with higher-quality food.|$|R
40|$|This study, {{using the}} method of direct {{collection}} feces, investigated captive <b>giant</b> <b>pandas</b> daily intakes and apparent digestibility coefficients of diet dominantly comprised of Phyllostachys vivax bamboo shoots. The {{results showed that the}} captive <b>giant</b> <b>pandas</b> daily ingested ~ 2818 g (dry mass) of bamboo shoots (corresponding to ~ 42 kg of fresh bamboo shoots with shells). Based on this daily intake of bamboo shoots, we further analyzed the daily intakes of dietary components, including energy, crude protein, lipids, hemicelluloses, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF). The results demonstrate that: i) the trials bamboo shoot diet provides <b>giant</b> <b>pandas</b> with sufficient and readily digestible, energy and crude protein; ii) the lipid (in low content) was efficiently utilized by giant pandas; and iii) the digestibility of fiber was very low in <b>giant</b> <b>pandas...</b>|$|R

25|$|For many decades, {{the precise}} taxonomic {{classification}} of the <b>giant</b> <b>panda</b> was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons. However, molecular studies indicate the <b>giant</b> <b>panda</b> {{is a true}} bear, {{part of the family}} Ursidae. These studies show it differentiated early (about 19 million years ago) from the main ursine stock; since it is the most basal member of the group, it is equidistant from all other extant ursids. The <b>giant</b> <b>panda</b> has been referred to as a living fossil.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{described}} the bacterial community residing in the guts of <b>giant</b> <b>pandas,</b> together {{with the presence of}} lignocellulolytic enzymes. However, a more comprehensive understanding of the intestinal microbial composition and its functional capacity in <b>giant</b> <b>pandas</b> remains a major goal. Here, we conducted a comparison of bacterial, fungal and homoacetogenic microbial communities from fecal samples taken from two geriatric and two adult captive <b>giant</b> <b>pandas.</b> 16 S rDNA amplicon pyrosequencing revealed that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria are the most abundant microbiota in both geriatric and adult <b>giant</b> <b>pandas.</b> However, members of phylum Actinobacteria found in adult <b>giant</b> <b>pandas</b> were absent in their geriatric counterparts. Similarly, ITS 1 amplicon pyrosequencing identified developmental changes in the most abundant fungal classes from Sordariomycetes in adult pandas to Saccharomycetes in geriatric pandas. Geriatric pandas exhibited significantly higher abundance of a potential probiotic fungus (Candida tropicalis) as compared to adult pandas, indicating their importance in the normal digestive physiology of aged pandas. Our study also reported the presence of a lignocellulolytic white-rot fungus, Perenniporia medulla-panis, and the evidence of novel homoacetogens residing in th...|$|R
