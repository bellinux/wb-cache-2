40|$|Since {{information}} technologies (IT) {{such as the}} 2 ̆ 2 Internet 2 ̆ 2 are being heralded as vehicles for increasing economic integration, {{the focus of this}} study is to determine ways that Internet technology can be used to increase West African subregional trade. The research design used both the survey and case methods to determine (1) perceptions of how the four independent variables (political, economic, social and technical) influence Internet adoption, and (2) whether Internet adoption has an influence on subregional trade in West Africa. The multilingual questionnaire (English, French and Portuguese) was based on an extensive review of literature and exploratory information taken from Internet discussion groups. The respondent sample frame was taken from embassy trade lists, commercial trade directories, and convenience samples of Internet discussion groups focusing on technological development in Africa. Questionnaires from seven countries were received. Case analysis consisted of a series of structured interviews which took place at a technology conference in Accra, Ghana. These interviews were conducted to supplement the survey response rate. After the data were tested for both reliability (alpha coefficient) and validity (factor analysis), five hypotheses were tested. The study found that (1) out of the four independent variables chosen for the study, only the political variable had a profound influence on Internet adoption and (2) Internet adoption is strongly correlated with subregional trade. Conclusions drawn from this study suggest that, despite the lack of ability to regulate the Internet, the government plays an important role in producing the a hospitable climate for its development. While cost is still a concern for most trade companies, awareness of the Internet is widespread and 2 ̆ 2 technophobia 2 ̆ 2 has been surmounted. Alternative power sources are needed to sustain growth and collaborative efforts are encouraged for subregional integration. Some recommendations are: formation of Internet advocacy groups to influence government technological initiatives; collaboration between subregional organs such as Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), West African Monetary Agency (WAMA) and West African Enterprise Network (WAEN); proliferation of subregional 2 ̆ 2 telecenters 2 ̆ 2; 2 ̆ 2 West African Internetwork 2 ̆ 2 topology using <b>Internet</b> and <b>Electronic</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Interchange</b> (EDI) to promote subregional integration...|$|R

Despite its potential benefits, however, many enterprises are still reluctant to implement EDI at least partly due to the difficulties of justifying the investment. This paper describes a long-term research project investigating the development of a generic EDI cost/benefit metric. The project is divided into two phases: an initial phase, in which individual researchers develop metrics for individual organisations; and a second phase, in which these metrics are tested and refined into a generic format.

This paper contrasts two strategies for implementing Internet-EDI systems. McKesson, Corp. treated its Internet-EDI system as a traditional information systems development project while Bank of America built its Internet-EDI system with a prototyping approach. The paper discusses the conditions in which either approach may be appropriate in terms of project goals, time constraints, environmental uncertainty; and organizational structures employed. It also suggests that emerging Internet-EDI applications could transform trading partners relationships by reducing the import of EDI-capability as a competitive asset.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{study the}} effects of the {{introduction}} of <b>electronic</b> <b>data</b> <b>interchange</b> between primary and secondary care providers on speed of communication, efficiency of data handling, and satisfaction of general practitioners with communication. DESIGN [...] Comparison of traditional paper based communication for laboratory reports and admission-discharge reports between hospital and general practitioners and <b>electronic</b> <b>data</b> <b>interchange.</b> SETTING [...] Twenty-seven general practitioners whose offices were equipped with a practice information system and two general hospitals. OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Paper based communication was evaluated by questionnaire responses from and interviews with care providers; electronic communication was evaluated by measuring time intervals between generation and delivery of messages and by assessing doctors' satisfaction with <b>electronic</b> <b>data</b> <b>interchange</b> by questionnaire. RESULTS [...] Via paper mail admission-discharge reports took a median of 2 - 4 days, and laboratory reports 2 days, to reach general practitioners. With <b>electronic</b> <b>data</b> <b>interchange</b> almost all admission-discharge reports were available to general practitioners within one hour of generation. When samples were analysed on the day of collection (as was the case for 174 / 542 samples in one hospital and 443 / 854 in the other) the laboratory reports were also available to the general practitioner the same day via <b>electronic</b> <b>data</b> <b>interchange.</b> Fifteen general practitioners (of the 24 who returned the questionnaire) reported that the use of electronic admission-discharge reports provided more accurate and complete information about the care delivered to their patients. Ten general practitioners reported that electronic laboratory reports lessened the work of processing the <b>data.</b> CONCLUSION [...] <b>Electronic</b> communication between primary and secondary care providers is a feasible option for improving communication...|$|R
