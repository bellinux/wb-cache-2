5|$|After {{the second}} lacuna, Hymir <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boat, unhappy and totally silent, as they row back to shore. On shore, Hymir {{suggests}} that Thor should help him carry a whale {{back to his}} farm. Thor picks both the boat and the whales up, and carries it all back to Hymir's farm. After Thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at Hymir's head on Týr's mother's suggestion, Thor and Týr are given the cauldron. Týr cannot lift it, but Thor manages to roll it, and so with it they leave. Some distance from Hymir's home, an army of many-headed beings led by Hymir attacks the two, but are killed by the hammer of Thor. Although one of his goats is lame in the leg, the two manage to bring the cauldron back, have plenty of ale, and so, from then on, return to Ægir's for more every winter.|$|E
5|$|Michael sneaks {{back into}} the office, {{crawling}} on the floor below the desks so Charles, who <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conference room, will not notice him. Michael grabs his customer list and makes a final desperate offer for the other employees to join him. Charles notices Michael and physically threatens him, prompting Michael to leave without the customer list. After Charles angrily closes the conference room door, Pam follows Michael out of the building, announcing that she is leaving with him. However, she tells Michael {{she wants to be}} a salesperson at his new company, not a receptionist. Michael agrees, then asks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he wants to come with them, but he declines. Pam and Michael leave together, feeling both exhilarated and apprehensive.|$|E

The ornament also has large letters interlaced by shoots with leaves and flowers. The Holy Virgin <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Oriental way with Child. The pattern of the rug is visible with drooping tassels. In Syunik temples of the thirteenth-fourteenth centuries the cult of the Holy Virgin was widely spread. She was depicted in relief, and many churches were dedicated to her.|$|E

[...] One tale describes how Wooden Leg and Little Bird chase a fleeing Reno soldier. [...] Neither Indian was willing to shoot a fleeing man, as it [...] "seemed not brave" [...] to do so.

As he <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> electric chair, it is suddenly revealed to Homer that he is on a new reality TV show, Frame Up that airs on Fox TV. The whole thing was just part of an elaborate hidden camera scheme, the [...] "man with the braces" [...] was the show's host, and Mrs. Bellamy is guest host Carmen Electra in disguise. Homer and Marge are reunited with the kids, and Homer is angry that he had to suffer so the show could get higher ratings. Carmen Electra tries to explain, but Homer is too busy looking at her breasts. Chief Wiggum, on the other hand, is irritated that the police department used was wasted on what turned out to not even be a real case, but he learns he will be in the show and Eddie and Lou will be given producer credits.|$|E

60|$|While {{they sat}} thus, {{one of the}} sons of Pallas--the Pallantidæ they were called--slouched into the hall to see if dinner was ready.

Then they all came together, and growled out their threats and fears, kicking at the stones in the courtyard, and quarrelling as {{to what it was}} best for them to do.|$|E

A Page Boy's voice, monotonously calling for Dr. Paramore, is heard approaching outside on the right.) ...|$|E
60|$|SCENE--Same as Act Three, {{about nine}} o'clock of a foggy night two days later. The {{whistles}} of steamers {{in the harbor}} can be heard. The cabin is lighted by a small lamp on the table. A suitcase {{stands in the middle}} of the floor. ANNA <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rocking-chair. She wears a hat, is all dressed up as in Act One. Her face is pale, looks terribly tired and worn, as if the two days just past had been ones of suffering and sleepless nights. She stares before her despondently, her chin in her hands. There is a timid knock on the door in rear. ANNA jumps to her feet with a startled exclamation and looks toward the door with an expression of mingled hope and fear.|$|E
6000|$|Hicks <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> court too, smoking his cigar. He and Lankin {{met in the}} fortifications.

[...] "And one man can about everything," [...] says I; at which Lankin blushes; and we take our flaring tallow candles and go to bed. He has us up {{an hour before the}} starting time, and we have that period to admire Herr Oberkellner, who swaggers as becomes the Oberkellner of a house frequented by ambassadors; who contradicts us to our faces, and whose own countenance is ornamented with yesterday's beard, of which, or of any part of his clothing, the graceful youth {{does not appear to have}} divested himself since last we left him. We recognize, somewhat dingy and faded, the elaborate shirt-front which appeared at yesterday's banquet. Farewell, Herr Oberkellner! May we never see your handsome countenance, washed or unwashed, shaven or unshorn, again! ...|$|E

6000|$|Dinner is over, and he <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garden, {{surrounded}} by those he most cares {{for in the}} world. It is the 1st of June, a day upon which a small party always assembles at his house. By his side is his wife, and next to her are Harry Shepherd and Nelly. Between the ladies a warm friendship has sprung up of late years, while that between the three friends has never diminished in the slightest. On Jack's other hand sits an artist, bearing {{one of the most}} honoured names in England, whose health Jack always proposes at this dinner as [...] "the founder of his fortune." [...] Next to the artist sits Mr. Brook, and beyond him Mrs. Simpson's father, a permanent resident in the house now, but some years back a professor of mathematics in Birmingham. Playing in the garden are six children, two of whom call the young Simpsons cousins, although there is no blood relationship between them; and walking with them are an old couple, who live in the pretty cottage just opposite to the entrance of the grounds, and whom Jack Simpson still affectionately calls [...] "dad" [...] and [...] "mother." ...|$|E
60|$|Busy is Mrs Miff {{this morning}} at the church-door, beating and dusting the altar-cloth, the carpet, and the cushions; and much has Mrs Miff to say, about the wedding {{they are going to}} have. Mrs Miff is told, that the new {{furniture}} and alterations in the house cost full five thousand pound if they cost a penny; and Mrs Miff has heard, upon the best authority, that the lady hasn't got a sixpence wherewithal to bless herself. Mrs Miff remembers, like wise, as if it had happened yesterday, the first wife's funeral, and then the christening, and then the other funeral; and Mrs Miff says, by-the-bye she'll soap-and-water that 'ere tablet presently, against the company arrive. Mr Sownds the Beadle, who <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun upon the church steps all this time (and seldom does anything else, except, in cold weather, sitting by the fire), approves of Mrs Miff's discourse, and asks if Mrs Miff has heard it said, that the lady is uncommon handsome? The information Mrs Miff has received, being of this nature, Mr Sownds the Beadle, who, though orthodox and corpulent, is still an admirer of female beauty, observes, with unction, yes, he hears she is a spanker--an expression that seems somewhat forcible to Mrs Miff, or would, from any lips but those of Mr Sownds the Beadle.|$|E

You see, we could not be sure whether the note would reach you; the man whom we bribed might have turned traitor and given it to the governor. My nurse {{arranged}} it; for it would never have done for Filippo to have appeared in the matter, and I am so well known in the place {{that it would have been}} very dangerous. However, we hoped that all would be well, for half the man’s bribe was not to be paid to him until you were free. However, we placed her at the corner of the street this afternoon in order to watch if anyone came to this house or stopped to look at it earnestly. The people are away in the country, and my nurse, who knew the woman who is left in charge here, got her to lend her the key until to-morrow morning, on some excuse or other. Filippo brought me round just before dark; there is an entertainment to-night at the Viceroy’s, and he had to be there. Indeed, it was the best place he could be, as no suspicion can now fall upon him of having aided in your escape. How did you manage it, señor?” ...|$|E
