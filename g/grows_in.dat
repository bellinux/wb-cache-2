5|$|Banksia ilicifolia grows {{exclusively}} on sandy soils; its range ends where heavy soils are evident. It especially favours low-lying areas. It generally <b>grows</b> <b>in</b> open woodland alongside such trees as jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), candlestick banksia (Banksia attenuata), firewood banksia (B. menziesii) and Western Australian Christmas tree (Nuytsia floribunda). Along the south coast, it <b>grows</b> <b>in</b> heath, sometimes forming stands with bull banksia (B. grandis).|$|E
5|$|Coprinellus disseminatus resembles C.impatiens, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} by its slightly larger fruit body, somewhat deliquescent gills, and tendency to fruit in smaller groups on the ground, rather than on or around rotting wood. Also, C.disseminatus has smaller spores than C.impatiens, typically 6.6–9.7 by 4.1–5.8μm. C.eurysporus is similar to C.disseminatus but usually <b>grows</b> <b>in</b> groups on fallen branches, and has broader spores that measure 8.3–10.3 by 6.7–8.4µm. C.hiascens usually <b>grows</b> <b>in</b> small dense clumps, has narrower spores (typically 9–11 by 4.5–5.5μm, and produces smaller fruit bodies.|$|E

5|$|Boletus auripes, {{commonly}} known as the butter-foot bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. First described from New York in 1898, the fungus is found in eastern Asia, Central America, and eastern North America from Canada to Florida. It is a mycorrhizal species and typically <b>grows</b> <b>in</b> association with oak and beech trees.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis <b>grows</b> <b>in</b> {{some areas}} {{where it is}} not {{believed}} to be indigenous. It is often found underneath oak and silver birch in Hagley Park in central Christchurch, New Zealand, where {{it is likely to}} have been introduced, probably on the roots of container-grown beech, birch, and oak in the mid-19th century—around the time exotic trees began to be planted in the Christchurch area. Similarly, it has been collected in Adelaide Hills region of Australia in association with three species of introduced trees. It has been growing plentifully in association with pine forests in the southern KwaZulu-Natal Midlands in South Africa for more than 50 years and {{is believed to have been}} introduced with the import of pine trees. It also <b>grows</b> <b>in</b> pine plantations in neighboring Zimbabwe.|$|E
