40|$|Results {{obtained}} in long-term carcinogenicity studies with animals should be evaluated, first and foremost, by statistical {{comparisons of the}} data obtained from the treated group with that from the concurrent control group. Often the results are compared with data from so-called historical control groups {{in order to take}} variations in the incidences of spontaneous tumours into account. Because <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> <b>data</b> change in the course of time and for a variety of reasons, certain requirements must be met before they may be used in the evaluation of the results of long-term studies. The present paper discusses potential sources of variability of tumour incidences in untreated animals, presents databanks for <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> <b>data,</b> mentions the factors that affect tumour incidences in untreated animals and describes biostatistical data evaluation. Finally, details are given of the criteria used by the DFG Commission for the Investigation of Health Hazards of Chemical Compounds in the Work Area to decide whether <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> <b>data</b> may be applied. These include the requirement that the <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> <b>data</b> were obtained with animals of the same species and strain and from the same breeder. The data were {{obtained in}} the same laboratory, the study design, experimental methods and assessment criteria were the same, and the studies used for the comparison were carried out within a limited time window. <b>Historical</b> <b>control</b> <b>data</b> that have not been published may be used provided they fulfil the above criteria and have been made available in sufficient detail to be comprehensible.

40|$|Historical control tumor {{data are}} useful in the {{interpretation}} of long-term rodent carcinogenicit y bioassays, especially to assess the occurrence of rare tumors and marginally increased tumor incidences. The major prerequisites to compare <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> <b>data</b> with studies under evalua-tion are the validity and consistency of the respective databases. The RITA (Registry of Industrial Toxicology Animal-data) database for histori-cal data of tumors and pre-neoplastic lesions collects data according to highly standardized procedures including tissue sampling and trimming, histopathology according to internationally harmonized nomenclature and diagnostic criteria, and peer review. All lesions that are entered are unanimously diagnosed according to IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) /WHO criteria. The validity of data is additionally con- rmed by a complete peer review performed by a database pathologist. Equivocal diagnoses and selected cases are additionally submitted to a panel of RITA pathologists. In the RITA database, there are currently 10, 896 rats from 106 studies with more than 17, 604 primary tumors and 16, 551 pre-neoplastic lesions. The RITA database for <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> <b>data</b> for Wistar and Sprague Dawley rats as well as for different mouse strains is brie y described. Based upon RITA background data, the survival rate of Wistar rats has been consistent over a period of 10 years. The occurrence of tumor-bearing animals also shows a stable percentage over a decade.

Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is a common method used to treat ARF in hospital. The main objective of our {{study was to investigate}} the effect of CPAP prior to admission to the emergency room, on the reduction of endotracheal intubation, in-hospital mortality and on the length of stay in hospital (HLOS). METHODS: A prospective, observational (non-randomised) study with a <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> group. <b>Data</b> from 3 groups of patients with ARF, irrespective of cause, was collected: pre-hospital CPAP (PHCPAP) group, i. e., 35 patients treated with a helmet CPAP in the ambulance, by trained nurses (mean age, years 80. 1 +/- 7. 9 SD; 14 males); hospital CPAP (HCPAP) group, i. e., 46 patients treated with helmet CPAP in the hospital emergency room (mean age 78. 6 +/- 6. 9 SD; 27 males), and a <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> group of 125 patients treated with medical therapy only (mean age 76. 7 +/- 5. 5 SD; 52 males).

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the use of}} <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> <b>data</b> {{in the evaluation of}} tumor incidences from carcinogenicity studies in rodents. Although the most appropriate control group for interpretative purposes is always the concurrent control, there are instances in which the use of historical control information can aid an investigator in the overall evaluation of tumor incidence data. One example is rare tumors; another is a tumor that shows a marginally significant result relative to concurrent controls. However, before <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> <b>data</b> {{can be used in a}} formal testing framework, a number of important issues must first be considered. The nomen-clature conventions and diagnostic criteria for each study should be identical to insure unambiguous identification of all relevant tumors in the historical control database. Criteria should be established that will aid in determining whether a particular study should be included in the database. This will assure a homo-geneous set of studies upon which to base statistical comparisons. Since study-to-study variability in tumor rates may exceed what would be expected by chance alone, these sources of variability should be identified and controlled. Finally, statistical procedures should be employed that adjust for extra-binomial va r ia bi I i ty. This paper also summarizes tumor incidence data from untreated Fischer 344 rats and B 6 C 3 F 1 mice in the National Toxicology Program (NTP) historical control database. All studies in the database are of two years duration, and all neoplasms occurring with a frequency of 0. 5 % or more are reported...|$|E
40|$|Based on our {{extensive}} pre-clinical {{data that}} show that ischemia/reperfusion-induced Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), an essentially treatment resistant complication in patients, can be effectively treated by the administration of allogeneic Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC), an FDA approved, Phase I Clinical Trial (www. clinicaltrials. gov; NCT 00733876) in patients who {{are at high risk}} of developing severe AKI post open heart surgery is currently being conducted. In this safety trial, patients who are undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass surgery or cardiac valve repair, who are older than 65 years, with underlying renal disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease will be infused with allogeneic MSC following completion of surgery. The MSC are dosed in an escalating fashion, the initial five patients being infused via a femoral catheter that is placed into the suprarenal aorta with a defined low dose of MSC/kg body weight. This report summarizes the clinical course of the first five patients that have been treated according to this protocol. The renal function did not deteriorate post operatively in any of these patients, nor were adverse (AE) or severe adverse events (SAE) observed to date. However, one patient died suddenly 26 days after discharge from causes that both the principal investigator {{and the members of the}} Data and Safety Monitoring Board judged as being unrelated to the study drug and its route of administration. The next group of five study subjects will receive an intermediate dose of MSC/kg body weight, and if no safety concerns arise with this dose, the final five patients will be treated with a high dose of MSC/kg body weight. Preliminary efficacy of MSC therapy in the prevention and treatment of post-operative AKI in this high risk cohort of cardiac surgery patients will be assessed by comparing outcomes in study subjects (frequency, severity and duration of post-operative AKI, dialysis dependency [temporary, permanent], length of stay, and death at 30 days) to those in a large number of <b>historical</b> <b>controls</b> (<b>data</b> base at www.

40|$|Background: Respiratory tract {{infection}} with Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurs inmost people with cystic fibrosis. Once chronic infection is established, Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{is virtually impossible}} to eradicate and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Early infection may be easier to eradicate. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003, and previously updated in 2006 and 2009. Objectives: To determine whether antibiotic treatment of early Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in children and adults with cystic fibrosis eradicates the organism, delays the onset of chronic infection, and results in clinical improvement. To evaluate whether there is evidence that a particular antibiotic strategy is superior to or more cost-effective than other strategies and to compare the adverse effects of different antibiotic strategies (including respiratory {{infection with}} other micro-organisms). Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search: 08 September 2014. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials of people with cystic fibrosis, in whom Pseudomonas aeruginosa had recently been isolated from respiratory secretions. We compared combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous antibiotics with placebo, usual treatment or other combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous antibiotics. We excluded non-randomised trials, cross-over trials, and those utilising <b>historical</b> <b>controls.</b> <b>Data</b> collection and analysis: Both authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Main results: The search identified 49 trials; seven trials (744 participants) with a duration between 28 days and 27 months were eligible for inclusion. Three of the trials are over 10 years old and their results may be less applicable today given the changes in standard treatment. Some of the trials had low numbers of participants and most had relatively short follow-up periods; however, there was generally a low risk of bias from missing data. In most trials it was difficult to blind participants and clinicians to treatment given the interventions and comparators used. Two trials were supported by the manufacturers of the antibiotic used. Evidence from two trials (38 participants) at the two-month time-point showed treatment of early Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection with inhaled tobramycin results in microbiological eradication of the organism from respiratory secretions more often than placebo, odds ratio 0. 15 (95...|$|R

Examples are given for analyses of these data for dependency on variables considered to be of possible influence on the spontaneous incidence of Leydig cell tumors. In the 7453 male rats available for analysis, only one case of a Leydig cell carcinoma was identified. The incidence of Leydig cell adenomas differed markedly between strains. High incidences of close to 100 % {{have been found in}} F 344 rats, while the mean incidence was 4. 2 % in Sprague-Dawley rats and 13. 7 % in Wistar rats. Incidences in Wistar rats were highly variable, primarily caused by different sources of animals. Mean incidences per breeder varied from 2. 8 to 39. 9 %. Analyses for the dependency on further parameters have been performed in Wistar rats. In breeders G and I, the Leydig cell tumor incidence decreased over the observation period and with increasing mean terminal body weight. The incidence of Leydig cell tumors increased with mean age at necropsy and was higher in studies with dietary admixture compared to gavage studies. These parameters had no effect on Leydig cell tumor incidence in breeders A and B. Animals from almost all breeders had a considerably higher mean age at necropsy when bearing a Leydig cell adenoma than animals without a Leydig cell adenoma. Studies with longitudinal trimming of the testes had a higher incidence than studies with transverse trimming.

Since the most relevant endpoints for our study are length and weight at test end, we decided to use the 15 % deviation as model performance criteria for all predicted endpoints (Additional file 1 : Table S 2). The general model performance of the physiological model was evaluated by deriving the MRE. The data from 13 publications that were used for calibration, together with the RE, are listed in Additional file 1 : Tables S 2, S 3. Corresponding model predictions are shown in Additional file 1 : Figures S 1, S 2.|$|E
40|$|Water {{distribution}} systems {{throughout the}} world are deteriorating {{in part due to}} corrosion of cast iron pipes. Developing {{a deeper understanding of the}} operational association with failure may lead to operational improvements extending asset life. Operations engineers can be expected to develop credible theories of pipe failure based on their experience dealing with failures in the field. However, these failure theories can be more rigorously tested by a systemwide investigation of a large number of pipe failures. A forensic framework was developed to investigate how system operations are associated with large-diameter trunk-main failures. The framework utilizes a pipe failure database and <b>historical</b> supervisory <b>control</b> and <b>data</b> acquisition (SCADA) data to analyze trunk-main failures. Using the framework, about 141 largediameter (≥ 300 mm) trunk-main failures were investigated in the Lake Zone in Newcastle, Australia. A predominant system failure mode called pump offpeak (POP) was identified that accounted for approximately 38 % of the failures. POP was characterized by an increasing static pressure in low demand periods with limited pressure relief from downstream reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|The cost of {{operation}} and maintenance of wind turbines is {{a significant part of}} the overall cost of wind turbines. To reduce this cost a method for enabling early fault detection is proposed and tested in this paper. The method is taking advantage of the fact that wind turbines in wind farms are located near similar wind turbines. This is done by generating a model for each turbine, the model is then used to evaluate the performance of that turbine and the nearby turbines. The evaluations from the models are then combined and used as votes to identify the faulty turbines. The method is applied and tested on <b>historical</b> Supervisory <b>Control</b> And <b>Data</b> Acquisition (SCADA) data from nine operational turbines over a testing period of nine months. The performance of the fault detection is found to be acceptable based on the testing period. During the testing period several gear related services were performed, some of these were predicted by the proposed fault detection systems. The advantage of the purposed method is that it applicable for operational turbines without requiring any extra measurements, since the used SCADA data is available from most modern wind turbines.

40|$|Background: Acute {{behavioural}} disturbance (ABD) {{is an increasing}} problem in emergency departments. This study aimed to determine {{the impact of a}} structured intramuscular (IM) sedation protocol on the duration of ABD in the emergency department. Methods: A <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> study was undertaken comparing 58 patients who required physical restraint and parenteral sedation with the structured IM sedation protocol, to 73 <b>historical</b> <b>controls</b> treated predominantly by intravenous sedation, according to individual clinician preference. The primary outcome was the duration of the ABD defined as the time security staff were required. Secondary outcomes were the requirement for additional sedation, drug related-adverse effects and patient and staff injuries. Results: The median duration of the ABD in patients with the new sedation protocol was 21 minutes (IQR: 15 to 35 minutes; Range: 5 to 78 minutes) compared to a median duration of 30 minutes (IQR: 15 to 50 minutes; Range: 5 to 135 minutes) in the <b>historical</b> <b>controls</b> which was significantly different (p = 0. 03). With IM sedation only 27 of 58 patients (47 %; 95 % CI: 34 % to 60 %) required further sedation compared to 64 of 73 <b>historical</b> <b>controls</b> (88 %; 95 %CI: 77 % to 94 %). There were six (10 %) drug-related adverse events with the new IM protocol [oxygen desaturation (5), oxygen desaturation/airway obstruction (1) ] compared to 10 (14 %) in the <b>historical</b> <b>controls</b> [oxygen desaturation (5), hypoventilation (4) and aspiration (1) ]. Injuries to staff occurred with three patients using the new sedation protocol and in seven of the <b>historical</b> <b>controls.</b> Two patients were injured during the new protocol and two of the <b>historical</b> <b>controls.</b> Conclusion: The use of a standardised IM sedation protocol was simple, more effective and as safe for management of ABD compared to predominantly intravenous sedation...|$|R
40|$|W e {{know that}} we have to be wary of waxing tooenthusiastic about a report on seven pregnancies in 5 women, but the article by Barua et al. in this issue of CJASN is the most {{encouraging}} report I have seen since the first time I started a pregnant woman on dialysis in 1984 and since the first successful pregnancy in a dialysis patient re-ported in 1971 (1). In 1984, our information on pregnancy in dialysis patients was based on a report from the European Dialysis and Trans-plant Association, which recorded surviving infants in 22. 9 % of pregnant dialysis patients (excluding therapeutic abortions) (2). For a brief period in the 1980 s, we believed that continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis might lead to better outcome in pregnant dialysis patients (3), but the difference was based on the inclusion of women who started dialysis after conception and the European Dialysis and Transplant Association report as a discouraging <b>historical</b> <b>control.</b> <b>Data</b> from the Registry o...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} part of a series of three {{articles}} on trimming instructions of rat and mouse protocol organs and tissues in regulatory type toxicity studies. It is based on the experience made in the European RITA and American NACAD working groups and is an extended revision of trimming guides published in 1995 (Bahnemann et al.). The optimum localization for tissue preparation, the sample size, the direction of sectioning and the number of sections to be prepared is described organ by organ. These descriptions are illustrated for each organ by a schematic drawing and a macro-photograph showing the plane of section as well as a low power view of the H&E stained slide demonstrating the optimum "end-produc". This revision will improve the quality and efficiency of routine procedures and facilitate daily work in the histotechnical lab. It will promote intra- and inter-study reproducibility and comparability and thus lead to a further coherence within each study and improvement of the validity of <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> <b>data...</b>|$|E
40|$|Reference {{ranges of}} {{standard}} experimental parameters {{are useful for}} comparisons in toxicology. The {{aim of this study}} was to collect data from 13 -week repeated toxicity studies in Crl:CD (SD) rats, a strain widely used for toxicity and efficacy research, for establishing domestic reference values. Data on body weight, food consumption; urinalysis, hematological, and blood biochemical parameters; and organ weights were collected from 11 toxicity studies in 220 Crl:CD (SD) rats (110 males and 110 females). The studies had been performed at a single testing facility over the last 5 years and involved animals sourced from a single breeder. The findings were collated as means, standard deviations, percentages, and ranges. Urine volume, uterus weight, eosinophil, and basophil counts, and triglyceride, total bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels showed standard deviations of 30 % or more. These <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> <b>data</b> would help to interpret the effects of test substances in routine toxicity and efficacy studies...|$|E
40|$|A Bayesian {{approach}} with an iterative reweighted least squares {{is used to}} incorporate <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> information into quantal bioassays to estimate the dose-response relationship, where the logit of the <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> responses are assumed to have a normal distribution. The parameters from this normal distribution are estimated from both empirical and full Bayesian approaches with a marginal likelihood function being approximated by Laplace's Method. A comparison is made using real data between estimates that include the <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> information {{and those that do}} not. It was found that the inclusion of the <b>historical</b> <b>control</b> information improves the efficiency of the estimators. In addition, this logit-normal formulation is compared with the traditional beta-binomial for its improvement in parameter estimates. Consequently the estimated dose-response relationship is used to formulate the point estimator and confidence bands for ED(100 p) for various values of risk rate p and the potency for any dose level.

Into this scenario, Pharmaceutical Care (PC) has been inserted in order to improve the management of SAH and reduce its risks. To evaluate the outcomes and healthcare assistance achieved after discharge of hypertension patients from the PC program. This is a quasi-experimental study with <b>historical</b> <b>controls.</b> Retrospective <b>data</b> collection from 2006 to 2012 was begun in 2013 and included a PC program performed over one year. PC was performed in two basic units of the public health system in Ribeirão Preto-SP, Brazil, where the pharmacist followed up 104 hypertensive patients. The clinical indicators of systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), triglycerides, total-cholesterol, high and low density lipoprotein cholesterol were collected, as well as care indicators related to the number of consultations (basic, specialized and emergency care) and antihypertensive drugs used. The coronary risk of patients by the Framingham risk score was also calculated. For the analysis, the data were divided into three periods, 2006 - 2008 as pre-PC, 2009 as PC and 2010 - 2012 as post-PC. In the pre-PC period, 54. 4 %, 79. 0 % and 27. 3 % of patients presented satisfactory levels of SBP, DBP and total-cholesterol, respectively. In the post-PC period, the percentages were 93. 0 % for SBP and DBP [p < 0. 001] and 60. 6 % for total-cholesterol [p < 0. 001]. The average number of consultations per patient/year in primary care was 1. 66 ± 1. 43 and 2. 36 ± 1. 73, [p = 0. 012]; and for emergency care was 1. 70 ± 1. 43 and 1. 06 ± 0. 81, [p = 0. 002] in the pre-PC and post-PC periods, respectively. The pre-PC Framingham risk in the last year was 14. 3 % ± 10. 6 and the average post-PC was 10. 9 % ± 7. 9.
