5|$|By the 1990s, new {{historical}} research (especially by Air Force historians Earl Tilford, Bernard Nalty, and Jacob Van Staaveren) and the publications of the Military Institute of Vietnam finally opened new perspectives on aerial interdiction during the Vietnam War. During Commando Hunt for example, the Air Force claimed that 46,000 PAVN trucks {{had been destroyed}} or damaged by air strikes in Laos. These figures were hard to reconcile with the 6,000 trucks imported annually into North Vietnam between 1965 and 1970 – {{for all of its}} operations. American claims that 80 percent of the materiel that started <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> was destroyed while en route to the southern battlefields had to be altered in the face of loss claims of only 15 percent by the Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|Sixty {{members and}} {{associates}} of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg, and Eddy families {{set up for}} the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when it rained. The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and Murphys another, and Reeds and Graveses the third. Keseberg built a lean-to for his family {{against the side of the}} Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. The cabins had no windows or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, 6 of whom were toddlers or younger. Farther <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: 6 men, 3 women, and 12 children in all. It began to snow again on the evening of November 4—the beginning of a storm that lasted 8 days.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1960s, when U.S {{military}} forces increased {{their presence in}} South Vietnam, the Laotian units at Ban Houei Sane also detected increasing North Vietnamese movement along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Towards the end of December 1967 six thousand trucks carrying supplies for Communist forces in southern Vietnam were detected moving <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trail.</b> That tremendous build-up came {{as a result of}} North Vietnam's decision to launch an all-out attack on Allied forces during the Tet celebrations.|$|E

25|$|A {{group of}} hikers were walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> as Welden was walking up. She {{approached}} them {{and asked them}} a few questions about the Long Trail. She continued walking in a northerly direction on the road portion of the trail now known as Harbour Road. Welden was on the Long Trail {{late in the afternoon}} and darkness was falling as she approached the end of Harbour Road. She may have continued into quickly darkening woods and it was presumed that she must have continued her Long Trail walk along the Bolles Brook valley, although there are no known confirmed sightings of her past the Fay Fuller Camp.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} North Korean armor came <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> {{from the north}} and shot up the {{artillery}} positions, enemy infantry closed on the 555th Artillery emplacements and fired on the men with small arms and automatic weapons. Three of the 105mm howitzers managed to continue firing for several hours after daybreak, perhaps until 0900. Then the North Koreans overran the 555th positions. The 90th Field Artillery Battalion suffered almost as great a calamity. Early in the pre-dawn attack, the North Koreans scored direct hits on two 155mm howitzers and several ammunition trucks of A Battery. Only by fighting resolutely as infantrymen, manning the machine guns on the perimeter and occupying foxholes as riflemen, were the battalion troops able to repel the North Korean attack.|$|E
25|$|By 1969 the Ho Chi Minh Trail was a {{sophisticated}} logistical web with paved roads, truck parks, maintenance and supply depots, and well organized and defended terminuses and bases, moving {{thousands of men}} per month into the battle zone. A fuel pipeline complete with pumping stations was even in place by 1969, and this was to multiply, together with other installations such as missile batteries, as the conflict extended. The need for massive amounts of manual labor for construction actually decreased on the Trail as heavy equipment like bulldozers and rock crushers were deployed, and both miles of road built and truck traffic expanded. By the war's end almost a million soldiers had made the trip <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trail</b> {{and tens of thousands}} of tons were being transported annually.|$|E

500|$|At the Flag Station Wilkes and {{his eight}} {{remaining}} men built a circular wall of lava rocks {{and covered the}} shelter with a canvas tent. A snowstorm was in progress and several suffered from altitude sickness. That night (December 23), the snow on the canvas roof caused it to collapse. At daylight some of the group went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> to retrieve firewood and the gear abandoned on the trail the day before. After another day's climb, nine men reached the rim of Mokuʻāweoweo. They {{could not find a}} way down its steep sides so chose a smooth place on the rim for the camp site, at coordinates [...] Their tent was pitched within [...] of the crater's edge, secured by lava blocks.|$|E
500|$|Turkey Path (blue trail markers) is a {{difficult}} trail, [...] long (down and back within the park), that follows Four Mile Run {{down the side of}} the canyon, descending over [...] to Pine Creek and the rail trail at the bottom of the gorge. It was originally a mule drag used to haul timber to the creek. [...] There is a [...] cascading waterfall about [...] <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> The park website classifies it as a [...] "down and back trail" [...] since there is no bridge across Pine Creek. The Turkey Path continues in Leonard Harrison State Park, going from a point on Pine Creek just downstream of the end of the trail in Colton Point up to the Leoanrd Harrison overlook on the east rim of the gorge. According to Owlett, the creek can be forded with care when the water is low, and the Turkey Path connects the two parks.|$|E

2500|$|The runner found Smoak {{with the}} rest of the {{battalion}} at 12:00. They were about [...] south of the trail junction, having been delayed by the late arrival of the forward observer team. Their progress had been further delayed due to the swampy ground which had made it difficult to bring up supplies to the assembly area. In response to the news of the ambush, Smoak led the rest of the battalion <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> as rapidly as possible in order to provide support to Company E. One platoon of Company F was left behind to provide security for the forward observer's wire team.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{days after}} the battle with Conner, on August 31, 1865, warriors from the same Arapahoe village {{attacked}} a large wagon train of road-builders led by [...] "Colonel" [...] James A. Sawyers, who were traveling on the Bozeman Trail, improving it as they went. The wagon train was besieged for 13 days at the Bozeman Trail ford on the Tongue River about halfway between Ranchester, Wyoming and Dayton, Wyoming. As the siege dragged on {{and a number of}} men were killed, Sawyers faced mutiny from his employees. Sawyers had started to retreat <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> when he met a contingent of army cavalry moving up the trail, who agreed to escort them to the Big Horn River, after which the wagon train proceeded on to the Montana gold fields.|$|E
2500|$|Camouflage and concealment. By 1968, {{business}} was brisk on the Trail. Ten thousand trucks could move at a time, and improvements were made continuously by the 559th Transportation Group. US air interdiction against the Trail increased as PAVN {{stepped up its}} activities. As noted above, the risk of air attack caused men and material to move along linked, but separate routes, and truck loading operated in shuttle fashion. The sheer volumes moving <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> however meant that the PAVN effort came under severe strain. Great pains were taken to camouflage movement. Bridges across water obstacles were often built under water, difficult to detect from the air, and multiple crossing points were developed. Wherever possible PAVN units minimized disturbances to the jungle cover, and even transplanted foliage from elsewhere to cover and conceal signs of movement. PAVN sources claim that the 559th Transport group camouflaged some [...] out of the [...] of trail.|$|E

2500|$|Nolan now {{decided on}} plan B, {{one that was}} made earlier by Jim Harvey. Eight men were to move forward {{following}} Tafoya's trail to Silver Lake and return with water. [...] Unknown to Nolan he would not see these men until August 9 {{and he would never}} see Tafoya or his horse again. After dark Nolan pressed the men another nine miles (14km) before stopping for the night near a mound called [...] "Nigger Hill." [...] Today it is located in Roosevelt County, New Mexico about a mile west of the Texas border. Nolan could hear men <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> and thinking they were lost fired shots into the air for them to find camp. [...] Some straggled into camp. Sergeant Umbles, the former First sergeant, was still out in the dark with two sick men. Captain Nolan then had the bugler, also named Nolan, to take a horse and to find and return the men to camp. Those four men never returned. Nolan would charge them with desertion upon his return.|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday, November 21, {{a hunting}} party of about 15 {{people were in}} a cabin on this private land. [...] Terry Willers, {{one of the two}} co-owners of the land, left the cabin and saw Vang sitting in a deer stand. He used a {{handheld}} radio to ask the people still in the cabin whether or not anyone should be in the stand. Upon receiving a response in the negative, he approached Vang and told him to leave the property. Vang then apologized and started moving south towards a trail through a forested area of the property. According to Terry Willer's testimony, [...] "As Bob got back on the radio and asked me where he was at and I said, uh, he's heading south down on the food plot right now. I radioed in to the cabin that I had a tree-rat and I had chased him off." [...] At that point five of the hunters from the cabin who had heard the radio message arrived at the tree stand. Lauren Hesebeck a surviving victim stated, [...] "Bob had said I'm going to go talk to him to find out who he is, why he's there, and make sure he doesn't, you know, knows that he's on private property and that he's not welcomed there. Denny had said to me this ought to be interesting, let's go and see what's going on. We got in the back of it standing up (ATV), hanging on the rear bar."After following the directions given by Willers, they proceeded to approach Vang further <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> Crotteau then suggested making a note of his hunting license number to make a report to the DNR and, according to Hesebeck's testimony, Crotteau [...] "flipped over the hunting tag on Vang's back to get his license number".|$|E
