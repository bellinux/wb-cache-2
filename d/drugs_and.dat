40|$|The <b>Drug</b> <b>and</b> Alcohol (D&A) Psychosocial Interventions Professional Practice Guidelines are {{the first}} generic {{professional}} guidelines for psychosocial interventions to be developed in NSW for <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol practice. The Guidelines take a stepped care approach to <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol treatment, which focuses on the adoption of best practice models for people with <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol issues, and reflects current best evidence and practice in the <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol counselling field. Responsibility for implementation of the Guidelines is shared across all levels of <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol clinical practice, and the Guidelines aim to increase the effectiveness of staff as psychosocial clinicians and systematise the use of psychosocial interventions for problematic <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol use across NSW. The Guidelines are intended to be applicable across the various allied health disciplines within <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol specialist services that are providing clinical psychosocial interventions. This includes Specialist and Generalist D&A professionals across public and private sectors. These Guidelines are not intended to provide detailed information relating {{to the implementation of}} all psychosocial therapies relevant to problematic <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol use. Rather, a range of psychosocial models are described with reference to the available evidence base for treating problematic <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol use, with readers referred to a range of additional resources, texts, and training courses that can provide advice and skills in the use of these psychosocial models. A range of treatment processes are described in Section 3 of these Guidelines, which are considered fundamental to any psychosocial intervention, regardless of the theoretical model on which the intervention is based...|$|R

Lilly hired his first full-time research chemist, Ernest G. Eberhards, and botanist, Walter H. Evans, in 1886. The department's methods of research were based on Lilly's.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to explore problem <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol users' {{perceptions}} of family members' coping in a cross-sectional interview study of problem <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol users, using a long semistructured interview. Participants comprised nine problem drinkers, five problem <b>drug</b> users <b>and</b> one problem <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol user (two-thirds male). Detailed qualitative analysis of interview reports suggested that <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol users have clear ideas regarding family members' coping. Coping strategies which encompass clear elements of concern for them appear to be well-received, in particular supportive coping and, in some cases, assertive coping. Controlling coping may be viewed positively by <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol users provided it is used in conjunction with supportive coping, thereby indicating concern. Furthermore, results suggested that users found all other forms of coping such as emotional, tolerant, inactive and avoidance to be unsupportive, the only exception being tolerant coping, which was found to be supportive when <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol users had no intention of altering their use. <b>Drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol users' perceptions of family members' coping may be viewed in terms of the stress-coping model. <b>Drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol users appreciate supportive coping actions, while coping strategies which involve family members withdrawing from them, making them feel guilty or forcing them to take actions against their will are felt to be unsupportive. The findings have implications for the way in which family members are advised to cope, not only in terms of their own physical and psychological well-being, but also in terms of how their actions are perceived by the users themselves...|$|R

40|$|The homelessness, <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol, {{and mental}} health service systems are {{separate}} service structures in Australia. They have their own unique funding and governance arrangements and work in separate domains. The homelessness service system fits largely within a community services support framework, while <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol, {{and mental health}} services are embedded within their respective health systems. Despite the fact that the homelessness, <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol, and mental health service systems are separate, they share many of the same clients and address similar problems among clients. Homelessness services, for example, provide support to clients who also have <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol, and mental health needs. Therefore, the homelessness, <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol, and mental health service systems interact. Service integration and effective working relationships between services across the homelessness, <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol, and mental health systems is, a priori, critical in achieving good outcomes for clients wherever they may be located. Service integration has become a point of policy focus in recent years. Despite the focus on systems and service integration in the present policy environment and among practitioners, there has been no study, as far as we are aware, of the integration of homelessness, <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol, {{and mental health services}} in Australia that also considers the perspective of clients. This study aims to fill this critical gap in the literature. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to increase our understanding of the extent and ways in which homelessness, <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol, and mental health services are working together to provide services to clients with particular emphasis on the needs of homeless people. The study also considers the barriers, costs and benefits of service integration and the perceived effectiveness of various integrated service delivery responses. It focuses at both the service level and at the level of the client and addresses the question as to client perceptions of the integration of services and the effectiveness of the services they are receiving...|$|R
