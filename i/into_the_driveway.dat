25|$|Six months earlier, down-on-his-luck screenwriter Joe tries selling Paramount Pictures {{producer}} Sheldrake on a {{story he}} submitted. Script reader Betty Schaefer harshly critiques it in Joe's presence, unaware {{that he is the}} author. Later, while fleeing from men trying to repossess his car, Joe turns <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> of a seemingly deserted mansion. After concealing the car, he hears a woman calling him, apparently mistaking him for someone else. Ushered in by Max, her butler, Joe recognizes the woman as almost-forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond. Learning he is a writer, she asks his opinion of a script she has written for a film about Salome. She plans to play the title role herself in a comeback attempt. Joe finds her script abysmal, but flatters her into hiring him as a script doctor.|$|E

50|$|The {{court also}} ruled that intruding <b>into</b> <b>the</b> defendant's <b>driveway</b> {{did not make}} the search any more {{intrusive}} or impermissible, as <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> “is only a semi-private area”. Since <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> is visible from the street, and serves as an entrance to the house for those who might, for example, deliver a newspaper to the house, there is no expectation of privacy in the area.|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} {{revolves}} around the fantasy of a computer store employee, as he dreams about a relationship with Carey. Throughout the video, the pair is seen to have a pillow fight; play laser tag, Guitar Hero and slot cars; and throw a frisbee. The video also features Carey in various revealing outfits. The video begins with a small Compu Nerd Volkswagen, parodying Geek Squad, pulling up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> of Carey's large manor. As the employee introduces himself, Carey flippantly refers {{to him as a}} [...] "CompuNerd", and asks him to follow her to the broken computer. As he attends to it, Carey removes her robe, and enters her large closet, leaving McBrayer to begin his fantasy with her. The first scene is of Carey wearing a tight pink number, laying seductively on the bed, as the computer employee plays with an electric guitar. He joins her on the bed, and she begins playfully spanking him as the two enter a pillow fight. Another scene is interspersed, of Carey sporting a mini silver dress, with tall socks and heels, flaunting her body. The fantasy then adapts to a new scenery, of the pair dressed in medieval clothing, while walking a unicorn, followed by the duo in a large room in the mansion, racing electronic cars. As they proceed to play laser tag, they are shown outside, laying on a picnic bed, with Carey dressed in a [...] "naughty school girl outfit". They both get up, and begin to throw a frisbee, before relocating in front of the main stairwell in the mansion. The final scenes of the fantasy are of Carey, wearing a shortened red gown, standing atop the staircase, and McBrayer climbing on his knees while carrying flowers. All the scenes begin to fade, with the last being Carey feeding him by hand by the refrigerator, as he wakes up with Carey, now dressed, poking him. She tells the employee that security will let him out when he is finished, and leaves him while he is still fantasizing about her.|$|E
2500|$|Referring to an {{incident}} that occurred on , 2013, Rodger wrote that [...] "he tried to shove girls at a party over a ten-foot ledge after being mocked but failed", and instead other boys pushed him over it. He said that he [...] "felt a snap in [...] ankle, followed by a stinging pain" [...] and [...] "tried {{to get away from}} there as fast as [...] could". Realizing that he left his sunglasses at the party, Rodger returned to retrieve them but the [...] "same people he had tangled with before began mocking him and calling him names, then dragged him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> to beat him up". One of Rodger's neighbors said that [...] "he saw Rodger come home, crying" [...] and said that Rodger claimed {{that he was going to}} kill the men involved, and [...] "kill myself". Rodger told investigating officers that he had been assaulted, but they determined that he might have been the aggressor. He wrote in his manifesto that the incident was the final trigger for his planning of the attack.|$|E
60|$|He led {{her back}} to the garage and helped her into the seat beside him. As silently as {{possible}} he ran the machine <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> A hundred yards to the left, half hidden by intervening trees and shrubbery, rose the dark bulk of a house. A subdued light shone through the drawn blinds of several windows--the only sign of life about the premises until the car had cleared the garage and was moving slowly down the driveway. Then a door opened in the house letting out a flood of light in which the figure of a man was silhouetted. A voice broke the silence.|$|E

50|$|The opening {{sequence}} of Ask This Old House {{consisted of a}} GMC van towing the blue Ask This Old House trailer from around Boston and rural Massachusetts before finally reaching its destination, the barn.

60|$|Madeline bolted the door, and, {{flying into}} the kitchen, she told the scared {{servants}} to shut themselves in. Then she ran to her own rooms. It {{was only a matter}} of a few moments for her to close and bar the heavy shutters, yet even as she was fastening the last one in the room she used as an office a clattering roar of hoofs seemed to swell up to the front of the house. She caught a glimpse of wild, shaggy horses and ragged, dusty men. She had never seen any vaqueros that resembled these horsemen. Vaqueros had grace and style; they were fond of lace and glitter and fringe; they dressed their horses in silvered trappings. But the riders now trampling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> were uncouth, lean, savage. They were guerrillas, a band of the raiders who had been harassing the border since the beginning of the revolution. A second glimpse assured Madeline that they were not all Mexicans.|$|E

Rockwell assumed that it was another prank by local teens. As a party member cleared the obstruction, two shots were fired at Rockwell from behind one of <b>the</b> swastika-embossed brick <b>driveway</b> pillars. One of the shots ricocheted off the car, right next to his head. Leaping from the car, Rockwell pursued the gunman. On June 30, Rockwell petitioned the Arlington County Circuit Court for a gun permit; no action was ever taken on his request.|$|R

500|$|On Wednesday, March 3, 1993, in Rancho Viejo, Texas, an {{affluent}} community {{just north of}} Brownsville, Fischer woke up early {{to get ready for}} school. Just before 7:00a.m., he went to the garage and reversed his mother's car <b>into</b> <b>the</b> circular <b>driveway</b> at his home at 3 Cortez Avenue. He then walked toward {{the corner of the house}} and grabbed a garden hose to spray water on the car's windows, which were covered in dust. As he sprayed the car, someone came from behind and shot him twice at point-blank range with what would later be identified as a [...]38 Super pistol. One of the shots penetrated his chest and the others his brain. Fischer's mother looked out the window to see what had happened, thinking the noise came from one of the house's palm tree branches falling on the roof, or that the car had backfired. She did not see the car, and thought that perhaps her son had gone to a convenience store to pick up something, but Fischer's brother Eric told her he could see the car parked on <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b>|$|R

60|$|We {{drove back}} to Mohair, Mr. Cooke and the Celebrity on the box, Mrs. Cooke and I behind. Except to visit the boathouses I had not been to Mohair since the day of its completion, and now the full beauty of the {{approach}} struck {{me for the first}} time. We swung by the lodge, the keeper holding open the iron gate as we passed, and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wide <b>driveway,</b> hewn, as it were, out of the virgin forest. The sandy soil had been strengthened by a deep road-bed of clay imported from the interior, which was spread in turn with a fine gravel, which crunched under the heavy wheels. From the lodge to the house, a full mile, branches had been pruned to let the sunshine sift through in splotches, but the wild nature of the place had been skilfully retained. We curved hither and thither under the giant trees until suddenly, as a whip straightens in the snapping, one of the ancient tribes of the forest might have sent an arrow down <b>the</b> leafy gallery <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open, and at the far end we caught sight of the palace framed in the vista. It was a triumph for Farrar, and I wished that the palace had been more worthy.|$|R
