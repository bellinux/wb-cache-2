5000|$|In September 1985 Daf {{introduced}} the legendary DAF 3600 ATi with [...] "Advanced turbo intercooling". Daf had taken several efficiency measurements at the engine, including new <b>hypoid</b> <b>drive</b> axle, whereby greater fuel efficiency and power was reached. It helped boost {{sales of the}} range until it was superseded. The most powerful iteration of the new ATi engines was the 1160 DKZ. With ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{develop a}} good quality of <b>hypoid</b> gear <b>drive,</b> the authors test the {{vibration}} and noise of {{two kinds of}} <b>hypoid</b> gear <b>drives</b> under different working conditions. The test object {{is a pair of}} <b>hypoid</b> gear <b>drive</b> used in the back axle of one minivan and a designed <b>hypoid</b> gear <b>drive</b> with high teeth based on the former. The results indicate that the <b>hypoid</b> gear <b>drive</b> with high teeth has lower vibration and noise...|$|R
50|$|The chassis {{was also}} new and {{features}} independent torsion bar front suspension and live rear axle with <b>hypoid</b> final <b>drive.</b> The braking system is Lockheed hydraulic.|$|R
25|$|A minor {{evolution}} of the preceding One-O-Four, the Majestic, like all new Daimlers following 1937's New Fifteen, was designed around that same massive cruciform-braced box-section chassis equipped with André Girling's design of coil-sprung independent front suspension with a well-located <b>hypoid</b> bevel <b>driven</b> 'live' rear axle using semi-elliptic springs.|$|R
50|$|The Melville {{was used}} in the 1976 movie King Kong, {{starring}} Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges. It was used specifically because of its <b>Hypoid</b> propulsion <b>drive</b> (at that time), which allowed it to move sideways. This type of drive is used, on research vessels, for station keeping in the ocean over drill and coring sites.|$|R
5000|$|An {{entirely new}} design of four-speed gearbox {{provided}} four speeds (constant mesh third) and reverse with a single-plate dry clutch which sent power through a <b>hypoid</b> bevel final <b>drive</b> {{to the rear}} axle and its 21" [...] Rudge-Whitworth wire centre-lock wheels.|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{supplied}} with the Daimler Fluid Flywheel coupled to a 4-speed Wilson Pre-selector gearbox. The {{independent front suspension}} used coil springs, while the back axle was suspended using a traditional semi-elliptical set-up. The chassis was [...] "underslung" [...] at the rear with the main chassis members passing below the rear axle. In mid-1950 the restricted ground clearance was improved by {{the adoption of a}} conventional <b>hypoid</b> bevel <b>drive</b> to the rear axle replacing the traditional Daimler underslung worm drive which had hampered sales outside Britain.|$|R
5000|$|The DC 27 {{used the}} Twenty-seven engine with a {{modified}} distributor {{and a single}} Solex carburettor {{in place of the}} DE 27's twin SUs. In this tune, the engine delivered [...] at 3,600 rpm, which gave a maximum speed of 60 mph. Typical of Daimler vehicles of the time, the transmission was a four-speed Wilson-type pre-selector gearbox with a fluid flywheel. Like the DE chassis on which it was based, the DC 27 had <b>hypoid</b> gear <b>drive,</b> independent front suspension, and hydro-mechanical brakes. The engine was positioned at a slight angle from longitudinal and the final drive and differential were offset toward the left. The DC 27 had a wheelbase of 150 in.|$|R
40|$|A {{computerized}} {{investigation of}} the influence of alignment errors on the transmission errors and the shift of the bearing contact is performed. The investigation is performed for an imaginary <b>hypoid</b> gear <b>drive</b> with conjugate tooth surfaces. The transmission error functions caused by misalignment are shown to be periodic discontinuous almost linear functions with the frequency of the cycle of meshing. The above functions can be totally absorbed by a predesigned parabolic function. The shift of the bearing contact caused by misalignment has been determined as well. The investigation is based on computerized simulation of meshing and contact of gear tooth surfaces. The machine-tool settings for the generation of the designed gear drive have been determined. A numerical example that illustrates the developed theory is given. ...|$|R
5000|$|Hypoid {{bevel gears}} {{are similar to}} spiral bevel but the pitch {{surfaces}} are hyperbolic and not conical. Pinion can be offset above, or below,the gear centre, thus allowing larger pinion diameter, and longer life and smoother mesh, with additional ratios e.g., 6:1, 8:1, 10:1. In a limiting case of making the [...] "bevel" [...] surface parallel with the axis of rotation, this configuration resembles a worm <b>drive.</b> <b>Hypoid</b> gears were widely used in automobile rear axles.|$|R
5000|$|The Phantom II used a {{refinement}} of the Phantom I's 7.7 L (...) pushrod-OHV straight-6 engine {{with a new}} crossflow cylinder head. Unlike on previous 40/50 hp models, the engine was bolted directly to the 4-speed manual transmission. Synchromesh was added on gears 3 and 4 in 1932 and on gear 2 in 1935. Power was transmitted to the rear wheels using an open driveshaft, a <b>hypoid</b> bevel final <b>drive,</b> and Hotchkiss drive, replacing the torque tube from a remotely mounted gearbox used on earlier 40/50 hp models.|$|R
50|$|The {{bodies were}} mounted on an updated pre-war Alvis 12/70 chassis that was widened and {{lengthened}} but retained the rigid-axle leaf spring suspension. Employing Silentbloc bushes (except {{at the front}} of the front springs to maintain steering precision) it is controlled by double acting Armstrong hydraulic dampers. <b>Hypoid</b> bevel final <b>drive</b> was fitted for the first time and greatly reduced the height of the transmission tunnel. Steering is by Marles with a spring spoked steering wheel. Mechanically operated brakes are two-leading-shoe type by Girling. Disc wheels replaced the 12/70's wire wheels and are fitted with larger tyres.|$|R
