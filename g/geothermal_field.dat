40|$|The {{conceptual}} hydrogeological {{model of}} the low to medium temperature Daying and Qicun <b>geothermal</b> <b>fields</b> has been proposed, based on hydrochemical characteristics and isotopic compositions. The two <b>geothermal</b> <b>fields</b> {{are located in the}} Xinzhou basin of Shanxi, China and exhibit similarities in their broad-scale flow patterns. Geothermal water is derived from the regional groundwater flow system of the basin and is characterized by Cl center dot SO(4) -Na type. Thermal water is hydrochemically distinct from cold groundwater having higher total dissolved solids (TDS) (> 0. 8 g/l) and Sr contents, but relatively low Ca, Mg and HCO(3) contents. Most shallow groundwater belongs to local flow systems which are subject to evaporation and mixing with irrigation returns. The groundwater residence times estimated by tritium and (14) C activities indicate that deep non-thermal groundwater (130 - 160 m) in the Daying region range from modern (post- 1950 s) in the piedmont area to more than 9. 4 ka BP (Before Present) in the downriver area and imply that this water belong to an intermediate flow system. Thermal water in the two <b>geothermal</b> <b>fields</b> contains no detectable active (14) C, indicating long residence times (> 50 ka), consistent with this water being part of a large regional flow system. The mean recharge elevation estimated by using the obtained relationship Altitude (m) = - 23. 8 x delta(2) H (parts per thousand) - 121. 3, is 1980 and 1880 m for the Daying and Qicun <b>geothermal</b> <b>fields,</b> respectively. The annual infiltration rates in the Daying and Qicun <b>geothermal</b> <b>fields</b> can be estimated to be 9029 x 10 (3) and 4107 x 10 (3) m(3) /a, respectively. The variable (86) Sr/(87) Sr values in the thermal and non-thermal groundwater in the two fields reflect different lithologies encountered along the flow path(s) and possibly different extents of water-rock interaction. Based on the analysis of groundwater flow systems in the two <b>geothermal</b> <b>fields,</b> hydrogeochemical inverse modelling was performed to indicate the possible water-rock interaction processes that occur under different scenarios.

The latter scaling rule does not apply to discharge data for boreholes with two-phase feedzones. Data from Oguni and Sumikawa <b>geothermal</b> <b>fields</b> indicate that the productivity (for boreholes with liquid feeds) and injectivity indices are more or less equal.

Information from 91 electric-power producing <b>geothermal</b> <b>fields</b> shows that: a reinjection plan {{should be developed}} {{as early as possible}} in field development and it should be flexible as it is likely to change with time. The optimum reinjection strategy depends on the type of geothermal system. For vapour-dominated systems which can run out of water reinjection should be infield. While for hot water and liquid-dominated two-phase systems (low-enthalpy and medium-enthalpy) reinjection is likely to involve a mix of infield and outfield injection. In general infield reinjection provides pressure support and thus reduces drawdown and the potential for subsidence, whereas outfield reinjection reduces the risk of cold water returning to the production area. Deep reinjection reduces the risk of groundwater contamination and ground surface inflation. The proportion of infield to outfield reinjection and the location (deep or shallow) is case specific and typically the infield reinjection rate will vary with time as part of the steam field management strategy.

40|$|Abstract. Resistivity {{techniques}} {{have been used}} successfully to identify and delineate geothermal resources in Iceland. The most frequently used techniques include Schlumberger, central loop TEM and head-on profiling. Geothermal systems in Iceland are located both within and outsite the active volcanic regions. Outsite the active volcanic regions {{the temperature in the}} upper most kilometer of the geothermal systems is below 150 °C whereas the temperature in the <b>geothermal</b> <b>fields</b> within the active volcanic regions exceeds 200 °C. The resistivity of the rock in <b>geothermal</b> <b>fields</b> located outside the active volcanic regions ranges from about 10 ~m to some hundreds of f~m, and are characterized by considerably ower resistivity than of the surrounding rocks. Most of the geothermal systems within the active volcanic regions, show common resistivity structure with low resistivity of 1 - 5 f~m surround-ing an inner core of higher esistivity. This increasing resistivity with depth is associated with a change in the conduction mechanism, from interface conduction to electrolyte conduction due to a change in alteration minerals at about 240 ° C. Examples of resistivity surveys of <b>geothermal</b> <b>fields</b> from both outsite and within the active volcanic regions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{processes}} that enhance fluid flow in crustal rocks is a key step towards extracting sustainable thermal energy from the Earth. To achieve this, geoscientists need to identify the fundamental parameters that govern how rocks respond to stimulation techniques, {{as well as the}} factors that control the evolution of permeability networks.

2500|$|The {{volcanic}} activity {{took place in}} several phases. In the first phase, uplift and extension of the Precambrian basement occurred in the central area. The first structure to be formed was probably Tarso Abeki, followed by Tarso Tamertiou, Tarso Tieroko, Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, and Ehi Yéy. The product of this early {{volcanic activity}} has been completely obscured by later eruptions. In the second phase, the volcanic activity moved north and east, forming Tarso Ourari and the ignimbrite bases of the vast tarsos, as well as Emi Koussi to the southeast. Thereafter, during the third phase, the outpouring of lava and ejecta deposits increased from Tarso Yega, Tarso Toon, Tarso Tieroko and Ehi Yéy; the collapse of these structures formed the first calderas. This phase also saw {{the formation of the}} Bounaï lava dome and Tarso Voon. To the east, the lava flows formed the large plateaus of Tarso Emi Chi, Tarso Ahon and Tarso Toon. Emi Koussi increased in height. The fourth phase saw the formation of Tarso Toussidé and the lava flows of Tarso Tôh in the west, the collapse of the caldera on the summit of Tarso Voon and associated ejecta deposits in the center, and the decline in lava production in the east, with the exception of Emi Koussi, which continued to rise. The end of this phase coincided with the beginning of the Holocene. The Yirrigué volcano emitted pyroclastic ignimbrite up to [...] in all directions, filling in valleys. In the fifth phase, volcanic activity became much more localized and lava production continued to wane. Calderas form on top of Tarso Toussidé and Emi Koussi, and the lava domes Ehi Sosso and Ehi Mousgou appeared. Finally, in the sixth phase, Pic Toussidé formed on the western rim of several pre-Trou au Natron calderas, along with new lava flows, including Timi on the northern slope of Tarso Toussidé. With scarce time for erosion, these lava flows have a dark, youthful appearance. The Trou au Natron and Doon Kidimi craters have formed even more recently, with the former dissecting the earlier Toussidé calderas. Lava flows, minor pyroclastic deposits, and the appearance of small cinder cones, and the formation of the Era Kohor crater are the most recent volcanic activities on Emi Koussi. Presently, there are reports of volcanic activity {{in various parts of the}} massif, including hot springs at the Soborom <b>geothermal</b> <b>field</b> and fumaroles on Tarso Voon, Yi Yerra near Emi Koussi and Pic Toussidé.
