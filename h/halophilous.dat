On {{the banks of the}} ditch a lot of Scirpus maritimus L. grows and a salty meadow is bordering the ditch. A total of 150 species were identified, belonging to 18 insect and 5 spider families. Seven species are <b>halophilous</b> or halobiont, comprising Stratiomyidae (two species), Dolichopodidae (three species), Muscidae (one species) and Cicadellidae (one species). Four other species are not true <b>halophilous,</b> but tolerate high salt concentrations. Amongst the non-halophilous species there are habitat specialists of reed vegetations, marshes and oligotrophic grasslands.

40|$|Abstract. Pollen {{analysis}} was conducted on a 290 cm deep core collected from {{the central part of}} the former Straldzha mire in northeastern Toundzha Hilly Plain. The radiocarbon dating indicated that the sediments were deposited during the last ca. 4200 years. Three stages of vegetation development were established: a) distribution of wet meadow and <b>halophilous</b> herbaceous mire communities and groups of deciduous and coniferous trees on the surrounding hills (4200 – 2830 cal. yrs. BP); b) expansion of <b>halophilous</b> vegetation dominated by Chenopodiaceae (2830 – 1330 cal. yrs.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the influence of weather (precipitation and temperature) and plant communities on grasshopper density over a 14 -year period (1996 – 2009) in Benito Juárez County, Southern Pampas, Argentina. Total density strongly varied among plant communities. Highest values were registered in 2001 and 2003 in highly disturbed pastures and in 2002 and 2009 in <b>halophilous</b> grasslands. Native grasslands had the lowest density values. Seasonal precipitation and temperature had no significant effect on total grasshopper density. Dichroplus elongatus (Giglio-Tos) (Orthoptera: Acridoidea), Covasacris pallidinota (Bruner), Dichroplus pratensis Bruner, Scotussa lemniscata Stål, Borellia bruneri (Rehn) and Dichroplus maculipennis (Blanchard) comprised, on average, 64 % of the grasshopper assemblages during low density years and 79 % during high density years. Dichroplus elongatus, S. lemniscata and C. pallidinota were the most abundant species in 2001, 2002 and 2003, while D. elongatus, B. brunneri and C. pallidinota in 2009. Dichroplus elongatus and D. pratensis, mixed feeders species, were positively affected by summer rainfall. This suggests that the increase in summer precipitation had a positive effect on the quantity and quality forage production, affecting these grasshopper populations. Scotussa lemniscata and C. pallidinota were negatively affected by winter and fall temperature, possibly affecting the embryonic development before diapause and hatching. Dichroplus elongatus and D. pratensis were associated with highly disturbed pastures, S. lemniscata with pastures and B. bruneri and D. maculipennis with <b>halophilous</b> grasslands. Covasacris pallidinota was closely associated with <b>halophilous</b> grasslands and moderately disturbed pastures. Weather conditions changed over the years, with 2001, 2002 and 2003 having excessive rainfall while 2008 and 2009 were the driest years since the study started.

Changes in the composition of a large spectrum of species of the local fauna and flora allowed the reconstruction of environmental conditions during the Late Glacial and Holocene in the Szczecin Lagoon. Succession of the diatom communities is the main topic of the present paper. In the Late Glacial sediments, the diatom flora was scarce and occurred only in core 42 / 99. In other cores, diatom assemblages characteristic for three phases of the Holocene development (limnic-swampy, marine/brackish-water and lagoonary) of the Szczecin Lagoon were distinguished. The Late Glacial (Older-Dryas (?), Allerød and Younger Dryas) record is incomplete and the flora is predominantly represented by Actinocy-clus normanii, Aulacoseira spp, Cocconeis placentula, and Fragilaria brevistriata.

40|$|International audienceWe have {{investigated}} the potential effects of global sea-level rise on Mediterranean coastal wetlands by studying the Coleoptera and pollen fossil remains in a 7000 -year sedimentary record, which we obtained from a coastal marshy area on a small Mediterranean island (Cavallo, southern Corsica). Using beetle structural diversity and plant composition as recorded prior to marine and human influences as a `past analogue', we reconstructed {{the impact of the}} Holocene relative sea-level rise on the coastal ecosystem. Our results show that beetle species richness and diversity were highest when freshwater was predominant, which was the case until about 6200 years ago. We also found that a major increase in salinity had occurred over the last 5300 years, experiencing a peak rate of increase at about 3700 years ago. These changes are clearly reflected in the fossil records of the following key taxa: <b>halophilous</b> beetles (Ochthebius sp., Pterostichus cursor), <b>halophilous</b> plants (Chenopodiaceae, Tamarix) and non-pollen palynomorphs (microforaminiferal linings). In particular, we note that the majority (60 %) of wetland beetle fauna became locally extinct in response to the salinity changes, and these changes were exacerbated by the recent aggravation of human pressures on the island. The major part of this diversity loss occurred 3700 years ago, when the relative Mediterranean sea-level rose above - 1. 5 +/- 0. 3 meters. These findings demonstrate the value of fossil beetle assemblage analysis as a diagnostic for the response of coastal wetland biodiversity to past salinity increases, and serve as a means of forecasting the effects of sea-level rise in the future. The conservation of inland freshwater bodies could ultimately prove essential to preserving freshwater insect diversity in threatened coastal environments...|$|E

In the case of S. media, a correlation between the occurrence of populations with a high representation of plants with unwinged and subalate seeds and the degree of extremity of the abiotic factors prevailing in the habitat seems to be manifest. In some cases overgrazing by sheep or cattle also results in a relatively high representation of such plants in the population, even if the abiotic factors are favourable. The possible causes of a selective advantage of winged seeds over exalate seeds in certain types of habitats (and vice versa) are discussed. The predominantly autogamous S. marina occurs in populations consisting of plants with unwinged seeds. However, one population was found containing plants with winged seeds; the possible ecological causes of this phenomenon are mentioned...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{studying}} the response of vegetation to environmental gradients, based on the community niche and fuzzy set theory, is presented. The approach is illustrated using an example from perennial <b>halophilous</b> vegetation along the Northern Adriatic coast of Italy. Compatibility curves are obtained by fuzzy set theoretical methods, and are used tomodel the response functions of plant associations to environmental gradients, including soil and ground water salinity, soil pH, soil and ground water temperature, percentage of sand, and variations in the ground water level. The compatibility curves summarize the similarity of a given plant community, with a particular value of an environmental variable, to the species combination of a given plant association. Compatibility curves offer an alternative approach to non-linear regression and best fit analyses normally used to model single species responses to environmental gradients. The approach is particularly useful given there is no singlemechanisticmodel that can capture the exact shape of the functional response along environmental gradients, and given that environmental data are commonly affected by high levels of noise...|$|E
40|$|In {{the article}} the {{analysis}} of life forms from 8 floristic complexes of the Aktobe flora region is given on 30 years of field and literary data. In every complex the life forms were described according to C. Raunkiaer and I. G.   Serebryakov; for a meadow floristic complex we applied the method of L. I. Kazakevich. In the steppe floristic complex of the Aktobe flora region the hemicryptophytes were the dominants and had 52. 4 % from all the species, the subdominant were therophytes – 26. 7 % or 122 species. Species distribution according to Serebryakov’s life forms showed obvious predominance of polycarpics that were 60. 7 % from all the species. The study of life forms of calciphilous floristic complex by Raunkiaer defined obvious predominance of hemicryptophyte compiled about of 54. 8 % from the total species number. Analysis of petrophilous floristic complex by Serebryakov showed the next pattern: pivot root grass herbares made – 26. 4 %, short rhizome plants – 10. 5 %, long rhizome plants – 4. 6 %, and turf rhizome plants – 4. 1 %. The analysis of life form of <b>halophilous</b> floristic complex defined the predominance of therophytes (38. 2 %) ...|$|E
