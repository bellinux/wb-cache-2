However, the radioactive half-life of 28Mg, the most stable of the radioactive magnesium isotopes, is only 21 hours. This severely restricts the experiments involving the nuclide. Also, since 1990, no facility has routinely produced 28Mg, and the price per mCi is now predicted to be approximately US$30,000. The chemical nature of Mg2+ is such that it is closely approximated by few other cations. [...] However, Co2+, Mn2+ and Ni2+ have been used successfully to mimic the properties of Mg2+ in some enzyme reactions, and radioactive forms of these elements have been employed successfully in cation transport studies. The difficulty of using metal ion replacement {{in the study of}} enzyme function is that the relationship between the enzyme activities with the replacement ion compared to the original is very difficult to ascertain.|$|E
40|$|The gamma {{particles}} of Blastocladiella emersonii are 0. 5 -micron (diameter), electron dense, membrane-enclosed organelles in the cytoplasm of zoospores {{that have been}} reported (E. C. Cantino and G. L. Mills, in P. Lemke, ed., Viruses and Plasmids in Fungi, 1979, and R. B. Myers and E. C. Cantino, in A. Wolsky (ed.), Monographs in Developmental Biology, 1974) to store the enzyme chitin synthetase. These particles were isolated from zoospores, and the two major proteins were purified for an analysis of their composition and function. The lower-molecular-weight protein (apparent molecular weight, 41, 000) was insoluble in aqueous buffers, had an unusual, very basic amino acid composition, and comprised the characteristic electron-dense inclusions seen in micrographs of sections of fixed and stained gamma particles. After dispersal of the <b>gamma</b> <b>particle</b> membranes with detergent, the higher-molecular-weight protein (apparent molecular weight, 43, 000) and a third minor protein (apparent molecular weight, 45, 000) sedimented through sucrose cushions with the 41 kilodalton inclusion body protein but were dissociated from it by sonication in buffer containing 7 M urea. Together, the two major proteins represent 60 to 70 % of the total protein in the <b>gamma</b> <b>particle</b> and 2. 9 % of the total protein in zoospores. Tests with specific antisera showed that the two major proteins were not antigenically related, a result consistent with the differences in amino acid composition. When zoospore lysates were centrifuged in sucrose density gradients, the major <b>gamma</b> <b>particle</b> proteins and chitin synthetase activity migrated to regions of different density. Proteins from sporulating thalli and germinating zoospores were separated by gel electrophoresis, and the two major <b>gamma</b> <b>particle</b> proteins were detected by reaction with specific antisera after electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose filters. Neither protein {{could be found in}} growth phase cells; the appearance and disappearances of both proteins were correlated with the formation of the gamma particles during sporulation and their decay during zoospore germination. The results indicate that gamma particles do not store chitin synthetase in the proteinaceous inclusion, but an alternative function has not yet been identified...|$|E

Specifically, we observe power law indices consistent with p ≈ − 2. 2 for high <b>gamma</b> <b>particles,</b> and p ≈ 0. 5 for low <b>gamma</b> <b>particles.</b> The break is found at a gamma higher by ∼ 0. 5 Mi/me than the gamma of the up-stream plasma relative to the shock. Further, we find that ultra relativistic counter-streaming plasmas create large scale magnetic fields and that the generated field propagate at v ∼ c. The magnetic field generation is due to a Weibel-like two-stream instability. These results may help explain the origin of the magnetic fields and accelerated electrons responsible for afterglow synchrotron radiation from gamma ray bursts. ...|$|R

The {{measurements were}} performed in nadir mode. The spectral domain 210 – 310 nm is considered. A comparison with a prior orbit which passed above {{almost the same}} path 6 days before the storm near Argyre Planitia has shown a significant decrease of the radiance factor. The difference grows at shorter wavelengths and shows significant dust absorption in the UV. The data {{have been used to}} retrieve the dust optical thickness τ, single scattering albedo w and asymmetry factor g. The fitting of the spectra by a radiative transfer code has revealed a set of solutions which could be constrained by Mie modeling of the parameters τ, w, and g for a <b>gamma</b> <b>particle</b> size distribution. The following estimates of the dust optical parameters are obtained: w = 0. 64 ± 0. 04 at λ = 300 nm and decreases to 0. 6 ± 0. 045 at 213 nm, g = 0. 86 ± 0. 03 at 300 nm and slightly grows to 0. 88 ± 0. 04 at 213 nm, τ = 2. 5 ± 0. 5 for the first dust event and τ = 2. 0 ± 0. 5 for the second one.

40|$|Powder forging is a {{technique}} {{that has been used}} to produce fully dense near-net parts from metal powders. Due to a “low cost titanium” product manufacturing initiative, targeting a reduction in the cost of titanium components, a titanium powder forging technique has gained significant interest. In titanium powder forging, powder consolidation is a key factor that influences successful component manufacture. Consolidation during titanium powder forging is dependent on the densification and deformation mechanisms involved. In this study, a finite element method is used to model the densification and deformation behaviour of titanium powder compacts during powder forging. The research focuses on developing a simulation capability and identifying a suitable constitutive model to simulate the powder forging process that can predict the relative density distribution. The simulation is carried out in Abaqus software and the results are compared with experimental results. A <b>gamma</b> <b>particle</b> radiography technique is used to compare the experimental density results with the simulated results. The Gurson and Gurson-Tvergaard models are used to predict the relative density of porous titanium powder compacts during upset-powder forging and are used to include the effect of hydrostatic stresses and the extent of densification. Three different modes of densification, related to powder forging were studied i. e. upset forging, hot-repressing and closed die forging. The simulation results indicate that both models can be used to determine the relative density during powder forging. By comparing the simulated results with the experimental results, it is found that the density prediction given by the Gurson-Tvergaard model showed closer agreement with the calculated parameters...|$|E
40|$|The high {{reactivity}} between the fiber and matrix in silicon carbide/titanium aluminide MMCs {{leads to the}} formation of brittle reaction products at the fiber/matrix (F/M) interface. Also, the high thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the fiber and matrix leads to high tensile residual stresses at the F/M interface, and this can lead to premature cracking during cooldown. One solution to these problems is the use of a metallic fiber coating like Ta which acts as an F/M diffusion barrier and reacts with the matrix to form a beta stabilized compliant layer. A finite element micromechanics analysis was performed to study the effects of Ta and beta interphase layers on the thermal residual stresses during consolidation. A 5 -micron-thick beta layer reduced cool-down stresses by 8 percent compared to a 2 percent reduction computed for a Ta layer of the same thickness. Plastic yielding in the Ta was not effective in reducing cool-down stresses. Compliant alpha- 2 particles next to the stiffer <b>gamma</b> <b>particles</b> reduced stresses in the <b>gamma</b> <b>particles</b> by less than 2 percent.
