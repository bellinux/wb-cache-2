50|$|For gas appliances, a flame {{supervision}} device (FSD) - alternative name: <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> device (FFD) - is {{a general}} term for any device designed to stop flammable gas going to the burner of a gas appliance if the flame is extinguished. This is to prevent a dangerous buildup of gas within the appliance, its chimney or the room. Causes of <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> include chimney downdraught, temporary interruption of the gas supply, gas under-pressure, liquid overspill on cooker hotplates or the draught from an oven door being opened and closed.|$|E
50|$|The intense {{ionization}} {{within the}} body of a flame can be measured by means of a current that flows when a voltage is applied by the phenomena of Flame Rectification. This current can be used to verify flame presence and quality. Such detectors are used in large industrial process gas heaters and are connected to the flame control system. They usually act as both flame quality monitors and for <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> detection.|$|E
50|$|Gas stoves today use {{two basic}} types of {{ignition}} sources, standing pilot and electric. A stove with a standing pilot has a small, continuously burning gas flame (called a pilot light) under the cooktop. The flame {{is between the}} front and back burners. When the stove is turned on, this flame lights the gas flowing out of the burners. The advantage of the standing pilot system is that it is simple and completely independent of any outside power source. A minor drawback is that the flames continuously consume fuel even when the stove is not in use. Early gas ovens did not have a pilot. One had to light these manually with a match. If one accidentally left the gas on, gas would fill the oven and eventually the room. A small spark, such as an arc from a light switch being turned on, could ignite the gas, triggering a violent explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> device for gas hobs and ovens. The safety valve depends on a thermocouple that sends a signal to the valve to stay open. If a draft blows out the flame or it goes out due to loss of gas pressure, the thermocouple cools and signals the valve to close, shutting off the gas supply. In gas ranges that come with a <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> device, lighting when there's no power can prove to {{be a bit of a}} challenge because unless the user is quick at lighting a match and then turning on the gas valve, the <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> device cuts off the gas supply within seconds if it senses that the burner isn't lit and there's not much of a point trying to light it once it has already cut off the gas supply.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, the term [...] "space rock" [...] {{came to be}} used when {{describing}} numerous American and British alternative rock bands of the time. Shoegazing, stoner rock/metal and noise pop genres emerged into the mainstream with the explosion of bands such as Kyuss, Monster Magnet, Slowdive, The Verve, My Bloody Valentine, Flying Saucer Attack, Loop, Ride, Shiner, The <b>Flaming</b> Lips, <b>Failure,</b> Year of the Rabbit, Cave In, Sun Dial, Hum, Orange Goblin, Spacemen 3, Spiritualized, and Mercury Rev. The sonic experimentation and emphasis placed on texture by these bands led them to be dubbed [...] "space rock", although most would more readily be categorized in other genres such as shoegazing or stoner metal.|$|R
40|$|The {{reliability}} of 45 state-of-the-art strain gage systems under full scale engine testing was investigated. The flame spray process {{was used to}} install 23 systems on the first fan rotor of a YF- 100 engine; the others were epoxy cemented. A total of 56 percent of the systems failed in 11 hours of engine operation. <b>Flame</b> spray system <b>failures</b> were primarily due to high gage resistance, probably caused by high stress levels. Epoxy system failures were principally erosion failures, but only on the concave side of the blade. Lead-wire failures between the blade-to-disk jump and the control room could not be analyzed...|$|R
40|$|The Los Alamos Controlled Air Incinerator (CAI) is {{a system}} {{designed}} to accept radioactive mixed waste containing alpha-emitting radionuclides. A mathematical model was developed to predict the pressure response throughout the offgas treatment system of the CAI during three hypothetical incident scenarios. The scenarios examined included: (1) loss of burner <b>flame</b> and <b>failure</b> of the <b>flame</b> safeguard system with subsequent reignition of fuel gas in the primary chamber, (2) pyrolytic gas buildup from a waste package due to loss of induced draft and subsequent restoration of induced draft, and (3) accidental charging of propellant spray cans in a solid waste package to the primary chamber during a normal feed cycle. For {{each of the three}} scenarios, the finite element computer model was able to determine the transient pressure surge and decay response throughout the system. Of particular interest were the maximum absolute pressures attainable at critical points in the system as well as maximum differential pressures across the high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. Modeling results indicated that all three of the scenarios resulted in maximum HEPA filter differential pressures well below the maximum allowable levels...|$|R
50|$|Snap action {{control systems}} are often run with electricity, where a {{stand-alone}} thermostat {{acting as a}} switch is activated by the capillary bulb fluid. The thermostat switches an electrical signal on-or-off to an associated solenoid valve, controlling gas flow to the burner. This construction allows integration of other control mechanisms into the system, such as pilot <b>flame</b> <b>failure,</b> but {{requires the use of}} components known to be sensitive to high temperatures and water damage. Solenoids and associated wiring are known to degrade over time, even if operating within their design parameters, due to the cumulative effects of thermal cycling and ambient grease and oil coating their surfaces - environmental aspects known to attack the integrity of plastics.|$|E
5000|$|Gas stoves {{became less}} {{unwieldy}} when the oven was {{integrated into the}} base and the size was reduced to fit in better {{with the rest of}} the kitchen furniture. By the 1910s, producers started to enamel their gas stoves for easier cleaning. Ignition of the gas was originally by match and this was followed by the more convenient pilot light. This had the disadvantage of a continual consumption of gas. The oven still needed to be lit by match, and accidentally turning on the gas without igniting it could lead to an explosion. To prevent these types of accidents, oven manufacturers developed and installed a safety valve called a <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> device for gas hobs and ovens. Most modern gas stoves have electronic ignition, automatic timers for the oven and extractor hoods to remove fumes.|$|E

40|$|A {{case study}} is {{presented}} of a fatal incident in which a man poured denatured alcohol on the wick of an alcohol stove {{with the intention of}} later lighting the wick, failed to first notice the wick had already been lit, and was engulfed in flames after the wick's flame followed the stream of fuel into the can, and caused an explosion that spewed flaming fuel onto his torso. A survey was conducted to examine common knowledge about the invisible flame of burning denatured alcohol, and showed that none of the participants were aware that denatured alcohol burned with an invisible flame before the survey, and that a small percentage recognized it as a hazard after reading the product label.

40|$|Incineration is a {{promising}} technique for {{the disposal of}} organic hazardous wastes. However, the waste destruction characteristics of turbulent spray flames have not been characterized. In the present research two reactors are used to simulate various aspects of liquid injection incinerator flame zones. The following questions are addressed: (1) Under what conditions do flames quantitatively destroy waste compounds, and (2) how must the flame be perturbed to cause it to fail to quantitatively destroy wastes. The two reactors operated on a simulated waste stream consisting of acrylonitrile, benzene, chlorobenzene, and chloroform. A microspray reactor was used to investigate destruction processes associated with individual droplets of waste compounds. A turbulent flame reactor used a heptane-fueled waste-doped turbulent spray flame to simulate incinerator flame-zone processes. The flames {{were found to be}} capable of quantitative waste destruction without the necessity of using common post-flame processes such as afterburners. Furthermore, the high waste destruction efficiency conditions corresponded to high combustion efficiency conditions (i. e., minimum CO and hydrocarbon emissions). Failure to achieve high destruction efficiency resulted from the perturbation of <b>flame</b> parameters. <b>Failure</b> conditions were identified with high and low theoretical air, low temperature, poor atomization quality, and flame impingement on a cold surface. Each failure condition also resulted in elevated CO and hydrocarbon emissions. Thus, the results suggest that CO and hydrocarbon measurements can be used as an indirect, continuous means of monitoring incinerator flame-zone performance. © 1985 Combustion Institute...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} investigates two generalized methods, i. e., {{a simple}} universal index and oscillation frequency, for the {{quantitative assessment of}} flame stability at fossil-fuel-fired furnaces. The index is proposed to assess the stability of flame {{in terms of its}} color, geometry, and luminance. It is designed by combining up to seven characteristic parameters extracted from flame images. The oscillation frequency is derived from the spectral analysis of flame radiation signals. The measurements involved in these two methods do not require prior knowledge about fuel property, burner type, and other operation conditions. They can therefore be easily applied to flame stability assessment without costly and complex adaption. Experiments were carried out on a 9 -MW heavy-oil-fired combustion test rig over a wide range of combustion conditions including variations in swirl vane position of the tertiary air, swirl vane position of the secondary air, and the ratio of the primary air to the total air. The impact of these burner parameters on the stability of heavy oil flames is investigated by using the index and oscillation frequency proposed. The experimental results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods and the importance of maintaining a stable flame for reduced NOx emissions. It is envisaged that such methods can be easily transferred to existing flame closed-circuit television systems and <b>flame</b> <b>failure</b> detectors in power stations for flame stability monitoring...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel millimeter wave radar sensor for UAS applications, in particular autonomous navigation in indoor GPS-denied environment. The sensor {{is aimed at}} both navigation with obstacle detection and highresolution 3 D mapping with moving target detection. Poor visibility due to dust, fog, smoke or <b>flames</b> often causes <b>failure</b> of state-of-the-art sensors for UAS, which {{are very sensitive to}} environmental conditions. On the contrary, a sensor based on the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) principle has been identified as potential candidate to satisfy stringent requirements set by indoor autonomous operations. Main features of the architectural solution based on frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) scheme and millimeter-wave technology are discussed. New procedures for system design are outlined and a set of nominal values for the system are provided. Finally, a software simulator, developed in order both to demonstrate that high-resolution, high-quality observation of an assigned control volume can be achieved and to assess mapping capabilities, is presented...|$|R

40|$|In {{support of}} the Apollo 13 {{investigation}} of the oxygen tank <b>failure,</b> <b>flame</b> propagation rates were determined for Teflon insulation in cryogenic and ambient temperature oxygen for upward, downward, and zero g burns. The propagation rates depended heavily on configuration and varied from 4. 8 to 10. 9 cm/sec for upward one g burns to 0. 48 cm/sec for zero g burns. In addition to the flame propagation rates, tests were conducted to determine if Teflon burning in cryogenic oxygen could ignite metals (promoted ignition) with which it came in contact. Tests conducted on various metal alloys used in the oxygen tank indicated {{that most of the}} alloys could be ignited by burning Teflon in certain configurations. After the propagation rates and promoted metal ignitions had been evaluated, a test was conducted on a quantity gauge and wire harness used in the oxygen tank to determine if flame propagation to the tank wall was possible.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{risk assessment}} (QRA) tool has been developed by TNO for the external safety of industrial plants with a dust explosion hazard. As a first step an industrial plant is divided into groups of modules, defined by their size, shape, and constructional properties. Then the relevant explosion scenarios are determined, together with their frequency of occurrence. These include scenarios in which one module participates, as well as domino scenarios. The frequency is partly based on casuistry. A typical burning velocity is determined depending on the ignition type, the dust properties and the local conditions for flame acceleration. The resulting pressure development is predicted with the 'thin <b>flame</b> model'. Module <b>failure</b> occurs when the explosion load exceeds thresholds, which are derived from single degree of freedom (SDOF) calculations for various types of modules. A model has been developed to predict the process of pressure venting after module failure and the related motion of launched module parts. The blast effects of the primary explosion are based on results from calculations with BLAST 3 D. The blast and flame effects of the secondary external explosion due to venting are calculated using existing models. The throw of fragments and debris is quantified with a recently developed model. This model is based on trajectory calculations and gives the impact densities, velocities, and angles as output. Furthermore the outflow of bulk material is taken into account. The consequences for external objects and human beings are calculated using existing models. Finally the risk contours and the Societal risk (FN curve) are calculated, which {{can be compared to}} regulations. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
