In June 2008, citing hikes in the price of oil and the need to contain operational costs, the airline reduced frequencies across its network and announced an increase in airfares to offset the increased costs, whilst taking advantage of the lower cost of jet fuel at Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok airports. Due to its small network which is reliant on fifth-freedom rights, Drukair regularly leases its aircraft to other airlines, such as Myanmar Airways International, Indian Airlines and Bangkok Airways in order to keep utilisation rates on its aircraft higher than they would under normal circumstances, whilst at the same time earning extra revenue.|$|E

25|$|Chickenpox is an {{airborne}} disease which spreads easily {{through the}} coughs and sneezes of an infected person. It may be spread {{from one to}} {{two days before the}} rash appears until all lesions have crusted over. It may also spread through contact with the blisters. Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters. The disease can usually be diagnosed based on the presenting symptom; however, in unusual cases it may be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the blister fluid or scabs. Testing for antibodies may be done to determine if a person is or <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune.</b> People usually only get chickenpox once. Although reinfections by the virus occur, these reinfections usually do not cause any symptoms.|$|E

25|$|In {{its earlier}} years, Mac OS X enjoyed a near-absence {{of the types}} of malware and spyware that have {{affected}} Microsoft Windows users. macOS has a smaller usage share compared to Windows, but it also has traditionally more secure Unix roots. Worms, as well as potential vulnerabilities, were noted in 2006, which led some industry analysts and anti-virus companies to issue warnings that Apple's Mac OS X <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> to malware. Increasing market share coincided with additional reports of a variety of attacks. In early 2011, Mac OS X experienced a large increase in malware attacks, and malware such as Mac Defender, MacProtector, and MacGuard were seen as an increasing problem for Mac users. At first, the malware installer required the user to enter the administrative password, but later versions were able to install without user input. Initially, Apple support staff were instructed not to assist in the removal of the malware or admit the existence of the malware issue, but as the malware spread, a support document was issued. Apple announced an OS X update to fix the problem. An estimated 100,000 users were affected. Apple releases security updates for macOS regularly.|$|E

500|$|Patrick Duffy {{returned}} to Dallas in 1986 after being absent {{for an entire}} season. The whole year's worth of episodes was written off entirely as Pam's dream. The storyline garnered the show a lot of publicity, both good and bad. The Staff of UGO Networks.com said: [...] "Soap Operas are known (and at times hated) for their ridiculously implausible storylines, and while '80s primetime suddser Dallas {{is still one of}} our favorite guilty pleasures, even the great Ewing empire <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> to the absurd storytelling techniques the genre has become associated with. While your average primetime soap operas don't usually mingle with the stuff of sci-fi and horror, there's an incredibly high rate of characters returning from the dead in the genre. Case in point: Bobby Ewing. Presumed dead after being run over by his sister-in-law, Katherine Wentworth, who also happened to be obsessed with him, fans (and CBS) had to do without Patrick Duffy, and even worse, ratings, for one whole season. Thus, Larry Hagman, who played Duffy's onscreen brother and despised oil baron J.R. Ewing, along with network execs, persuaded Duffy to return, making it possible (we're talking in soap opera terms here), for Bobby Ewing's character to come back by writing off the ratings nightmare of a season as a dream... a very bad one." ...|$|E

[...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times enjoyed The Frighteners, but [...] "walked out the theater with mixed emotions," [...] she commented that [...] "Peter Jackson deserves more enthusiasm for expert, imaginative effects than for his live actors anyhow. These lively touches would leave The Frighteners looking more like a more frantic Beetlejuice if Jackson's film weren't so wearyingly overcrowded. The Frighteners <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> to overkill, even though most of its characters are already dead." [...] Jeff Vice of the Deseret News praised the acting in the film, with the performances of Fox and Alvarado in particular, but said that there were also [...] "bits that push the taste barrier too far and which grind things to a screeching halt", and that if [...] "Jackson had used the restraint he showed in Heavenly Creatures, the movie could have [...] "been the best of its kind". Critic Christopher Null praised the film, as he described it as a mixture between Ghostbusters and Twin Peaks. Michael Drucker of IGN said that although the film wouldn't make Jackson's top five of movies, it [...] "is a harmless and fun dark comedy that you'll enjoy casually watching from time to time". The Frighteners received mixed reviews from critics from Jackson's native country, New Zealand.|$|E

2500|$|A {{controversial}} GCHQ case {{determined the}} scope of judicial review of prerogative powers (the Crown's residual powers under common law).

It was held that executive action <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> from judicial review simply because it uses powers derived from common law rather than statute (thus the prerogative is reviewable).

2500|$|In 1994 two set of {{complaints}} (Doe v. Karadžić and Kadić v. Karadžić), both with multiple plaintiffs, filed suits under the Alien Tort Claims Act and the Torture Victims Protection Act in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, against Radovan Karadžić for various atrocities [...] "carried out by Bosnian-Serb military forces {{as part of}} a genocidal campaign". The district court dismissed both cases claiming that named statutes required [...] "state action", however the court of appeals revised and remanded that judgment, stating that [...] "Karadžić may be found liable for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in his private capacity and for other violations in his capacity as a state actor, and that he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> from service of process". Karadžić was personally served with summons and complaint in each action during his visits to U.N. in New York, and he actively participated through his lawyers in the proceedings (Ramsey Clark, as his attorney), until the Supreme Court of the United States denied his request to review the decision of the court of appeals. In 2000, the district court entered order of default in Kadić v. Karadžić, after which the case proceeded to a damages phase in which the jury returned a verdict of US$745 million (US$265 million in compensatory damages and US$480 million in punitive damages), which was then incorporated in the judgment of the court, in favour of fourteen plaintiffs. The court also issued a permanent injunction by which Karadžić and his subordinates were enjoined and restrained from committing or facilitating [...] "any acts of 'ethnic cleansing' or genocide (...) or any other act committed in order to harm, destroy or exterminate any person on the basis of ethnicity, religion and/or nationality". In the same year, in Doe v. Karadžić, the court decided in favour of twenty-one plaintiffs, and awarded them US$407 million in compensatory damages and US$3.8 billion in punitive damages. As of 2008 the plaintiffs did not receive damages. Deputy High representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, , stated that OHR was considering ways of confiscating Karadžić's property, including that of his closest relatives and network of his supporters, and that EUFOR had taken measurements of his family house in Pale.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 November, The Court of Administrative Justice said {{it would}} hold a first hearing on 4 December in a case brought by lawyers and activists against the declaration. Morsi met {{with representatives of the}} Supreme Judicial Council in an effort to settle the crisis over the extent of his powers {{following}} his 22 November constitutional declaration. He agreed to limit his decree on his decisions related to [...] "sovereign matters" [...] only. Morsy [...] "did not give himself judicial power" [...] but did provide [...] "immunity for his presidential decisions," [...] said Jihad Haddad, a senior adviser in the Freedom and Justice Party. Haddad added that [...] "the president himself (<b>is)</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> from judicial oversight," [...] though it wasn't clear in what circumstances that might apply, or if there was anything preventing Morsi from issuing a new decree to forestall that. According to Al-Jazeera [...] "sovereign matters" [...] were widely interpreted to cover the declaration of war, imposition of martial law, breaking diplomatic relations with a foreign nation, or dismissing the cabinet. Activists on Monday camped in Cairo's Tahrir Square for a fourth day, blocking traffic with makeshift barricades to protest against what they said was a power-grab by Morsi. Nearby, riot police and protesters clashed intermittently. In addition to popular outbursts on the street, Egypt's judges reacted. All but seven of Egypt's 34 courts and 90% of its prosecutors went on strike Monday in protest, according to Judge Mohamed al-Zind of the Egyptian Judge's Club. Muslim Brotherhood supporters staged a counter-demonstration, while they were relocated from central Cairo to a location in front of Cairo University in Giza. Egypt's stock market, which had seen a fall of almost 10% on 25 November 2012, recovered some ground on Monday morning. Islam Fathy Massoud member of the Muslim Brotherhood was killed during protests in Damanhour. Gaber Salah, a member of the April 6 Youth Movement, was pronounced dead. He had received a rubber bullet shot at close range during clashes with riot police in downtown Cairo. The funeral of Islam Fathy Massoud, who died in the Nile Delta town of Damanhour in a clash between the president's supporters and opponents, was held on Monday, while in Cairo thousands of people marched through Tahrir Square for the funeral of Gaber Salah.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{difficult}} to maintain true perspective in large affairs. I have criticized the work of Paris, and have depicted in somber colors the condition and the prospects of Europe. This is {{one aspect of the}} position and, I believe, a true one. But in so complex a phenomenon the prognostics do not all point one way; and we may make the error of expecting consequences to follow too swiftly and too inevitably from what perhaps are not all the relevant causes. The blackness of the prospect itself leads us to doubt its accuracy; our imagination is dulled rather than stimulated by too woeful a narration, and our minds rebound from what is felt [...] "too bad to be true." [...] But before the reader allows himself to be too much swayed by these natural reflections, and before I lead him, as is the intention of this chapter, towards remedies and ameliorations and the discovery of happier tendencies, let him redress the balance of his thought by recalling two contrasts--England and Russia, of which the one may encourage his optimism too much, but the other should remind him that catastrophes can still happen, and that modern society <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>immune</b> from the very greatest evils.|$|E
