40|$|Because of {{the fishing}} {{pressure}} and frequent marine engineering lead to {{the deterioration of the}} offshore marine environment, hair-tail (Trichiurus haumela) resource was in a serious recession in East China Sea. For sustainable use of <b>hairtail</b> resource, a bottom trawl inves-tigation was conducted for selective test <b>hairtail</b> by using diamond mesh 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 mm and 80 mm in the East China Sea in sum-mer 2014. Selectivity for different sizes of codend was analyzed and compared by using the method of set of network. The results showed that <b>hairtail</b> fish anal long range was 55 ~ 283 mm, the average anal was 159 mm long, advantage anal group was 140 ~ 190 mm long. The main anal codend <b>hairtail</b> fish long group distributed in 140 ~ 220 mm and major sets of anal distribution was in 130 ~ 190 mm long. Longer the average anal codend <b>hairtail,</b> body quality also increased gradually, as the mesh changed from small to big. The quantity and quality of body escape rate first decreased and then increased as the mesh increased. Because other non-target fish and shape of <b>hairtail</b> easy to hang net, the blocking effect of codend catches accumulation caused serious impact on relevant <b>hairtail</b> escape rate in the mesh.

The average bandsharing value (mean±SD) within <b>hairtail</b> population from Korea showed 0. 859 ± 0. 031, whereas 0. 752 ± 0. 039 within population from China. Also, bandsharing values between two <b>hairtail</b> populations ranged from 0. 470 to 0. 611, with an average of 0. 542 ± 0. 059. As compared separately, the bandsharing values of individuals within <b>hairtail</b> population from Korea were comparatively higher than those of individuals within population from China. The hierarchical dendrogram resulted from reliable oligonucleotides primers, indicating two genetic clusters composed of cluster 1 (KOREANHAIR 1 ~KOREANHAIR 11) and cluster 2 (CHINESEHAI 12 ~CHINESEHAI 22). The genetic distances between two geographic populations ranged from 0. 038 to 0. 476.

As a result, {{the fishing industry}} has begun developing devices to prevent jellyfish capture. In this study, we assessed {{the performance of a}} conical jellyfish exclusion device in the coastal areas of Yokji Island in southern Korea during 2009. After hauling, we measured the length, diameter, and weight of the jellyfish and fish that were captured by the cod end and cover net. We found that the captured species included N. nomurai, silver croakers Pennahia argentata, yellow croakers Larimichthys polyactics, shotted halibut Eopsetta grigorjewi, largehead <b>hairtails</b> Trichiurus lepturus, and melon seeds Psenopsis anomala. The catch ratios of the giant jellyfish that entered the cod end in terms of weight ranged from 0. 005 to 0. 027. In contrast, the catch ratios of total fish in terms of weight and number were 0. 793 and 0. 835, respectively. On selectivity analysis of a conical separator for individual fish species, their exclusion ratios were independent of their length, and were similar to their observed exclusion ratios in terms of number. These results indicated that the conical jellyfish exclusion device performs well; however, some improvements are needed to minimize the escape of fish from the net...|$|E

40|$|Diurnal {{variation}} in trawl catches {{and its influence}} on energy efficiency of trawler operations are discussed in this paper, based on data on landings of a Japanese factory trawler which operated in the Indian waters during 1992 - 93. The factory vessel equipped for stern trawling had a length overall of 110 m, GT of 5460 and installed engine power of 5700 hp. Operations were conducted off west coast of India between 31 and 278 m depth contours, using a 80. 4 m high opening bottom trawl with an adjusted vertical opening of 7. 6  0. 9 m. The catch data was grouped according to the median towing hour, {{by the time of}} the day. CPUE obtained was 3713. 4 kg. h- 1 for day time operations and 1536. 6 kg. h- 1 for night-time operations. Mean daily catches were 31367 kg. day- 1 (SE: 2743) for day time operations and 9430 kg. day- 1 (SE: 966) for night-time operations. Fuel consumption were 0. 399 and 0. 982 kg fuel. kg fish- 1, respectively for day and night-time operations. Total catch and catch components such as threadfin bream, bulls eye, <b>hairtails,</b> trevelly, lizard fish showed significant improvement during day-time operations while swarming crabs showed a significant improvement in the night-time operations. The difference in catch rates between day and night could be attributed to diurnal {{variation in}} the spatial distribution and schooling behaviour of the catch categories, their differential behaviour in the vicinity of trawl systems under varying light levels of day and night and consequent effect on catching efficiency and size selectivity at different stages in the capture process. The results obtained in addition to its importance in the operational planning of trawling in order to realise objectives of maximising catch per unit effort and minimising fuel consumption per unit volume of fish caught, has added significance in the use of bottom trawl surveys in stock abundance estimates...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The spatial {{distribution}} of fish on feeding grounds {{is an important factor}} in determining their prey composition. Of the factors that may influence the {{spatial distribution}} on the feeding ground and sub-sequent diet composition is the fish maturation stage. Using <b>hairtail</b> (Trichiurus japonicus) as an example, we evaluated the impacts of gonad development stage on diet composition. <b>Hairtail</b> supports one of the most valuable and largest fisheries in the East China Sea. As one of the top predators, it plays an important role in the ecosystem. We analyzed <b>hairtail</b> stomach samples collected on their feeding grounds from a fisheries-independent survey program in September 2005. Our analyses suggest that females in their third maturity stage tended to feed more intensively. Fish were the most important preys for <b>hairtail,</b> accounting for 72. 6 % of the total stomach contents in weight. The four most important fish species were juvenile <b>hairtail</b> (25. 2 %), Japanese scad (11. 4 %), Japanese jack mackerel (7. 7 %), and small yellow croaker (5. 9 %), suggesting strong cannibalism. A cluster analysis suggests that <b>hairtail</b> could be divided into three groups in their spatial distribution based on their diets: one group with similar percentages of fish and crustacean preys mainly distributed in the south of East China Sea far from the coast; one group mainly consuming fish and distributed over the north of East China Sea near the coast; and the third group consuming mainly crustacean species mainly distributed in the open sea. We hypothesize that gonadal development stage of <b>hairtail</b> may deter-mine their movement from spawning ground to feeding ground, and subsequently spatial distribution on the feeding ground, which in turn results in different feeding intensities and prey compositions...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} method for {{building}} a simple and reproducible electronic nose based on commercially available metal oxide sensors (MOS) to monitor the freshness of <b>hairtail</b> fish and pork stored at 15, 10, and 5 °C. After assembly in the laboratory, the proposed product was tested by a manufacturer.

The compensation method and pattern recognition based on PCA are discussed in the current paper. PCA compensation can be used for all storage temperatures, however, pattern recognition differs according to storage conditions. Total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) and aerobic bacterial counts of the samples were measured simultaneously with the standard indicators of <b>hairtail</b> fish and pork freshness. The PCA models based on TVBN and aerobic bacterial counts were used to classify <b>hairtail</b> fish samples as “fresh” (TVBN ≤ 25 g and microbial counts ≤ 106 cfu/g) or “spoiled” (TVBN ≥ 25 g and microbial counts ≥ 106 cfu/g) and pork samples also as “fresh” (TVBN ≤ 15 g and microbial counts ≤ 106 cfu/g) or “spoiled” (TVBN ≥ 15 g and microbial counts ≥ 106 cfu/g). Good correlation coefficients between the responses of the electronic nose and the TVBN and aerobic bacterial counts of the samples were obtained. For <b>hairtail</b> fish, correlation coefficients were 0. 97 and 0. 91, and for pork, correlation coefficients were 0. 81 and 0. 88, respectively.
