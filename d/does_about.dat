5|$|The average {{urbanisation}} rate in Croatia stands at 56%, {{with a growing}} urban population and shrinking rural population. The largest city and the nation's capital is Zagreb, with an urban population of 686,568 in the city itself. Zagreb's metropolitan area encompasses 341 additional settlements and, by the year 2001, {{the population of the}} area had reached 978,161; approximately 60% of Zagreb County's residents live in Zagreb's metropolitan area, as <b>does</b> <b>about</b> 41% of Croatia's urban population. The cities of Split and Rijeka are the largest settlements on the Croatian Adriatic coast, with each city's population being over 100,000. There are four other Croatian cities exceeding 50,000people: Osijek, Zadar, Pula and Slavonski Brod; the Zagreb district of Sesvete, which has the status of a standalone settlement but not a city, also has such a large population. A further eleven cities are populated by more than 20,000.|$|E
5|$|The male becomes broody {{after his}} mate starts laying, and {{may begin to}} {{incubate}} the eggs before the clutch is complete. From this time on, he does not eat, drink, or defecate, and stands only to turn the eggs, which he <b>does</b> <b>about</b> ten times a day. He develops a brood patch, a bare area of wrinkled skin which is in intimate contact with the eggs. Over {{the course of the}} eight-week incubation period, he will lose a third of his weight and will survive on stored body fat and on any morning dew that he can reach from the nest. As with many other Australian birds, such as the superb fairywren, infidelity is the norm for emus, despite the initial pair bond: once the male starts brooding, the female usually wanders off, and may mate with other males and lay in multiple nests; thus, as many as half the chicks in a brood may not be fathered by the incubating male, or even by either parent, as emus also exhibit brood parasitism.|$|E

500|$|The {{education}} that Beiderbecke {{did not receive}} from the University of Iowa, in other words, he sought through Whiteman. In the meantime, Beiderbecke played on four number-one records in 1928, all under the Whiteman name: [...] "Together", [...] "Ramona", [...] "My Angel", and [...] "Ol' Man River", which featured Bing Crosby on vocals. This accomplishment says less about the jazz excellence of these records than it <b>does</b> <b>about</b> the tastes of the largely white, record-buying public to which Whiteman (and Goldkette before him) catered.|$|E
500|$|Cheryl L. Nixon {{suggested}} in Jane Austen in Hollywood that Darcy's dive is a [...] "revelation of his emotional capabilities", expressing a [...] "Romantic bond with nature, {{a celebration of}} his home where he can 'strip down' to his essential self, a cleansing of social prejudices from his mind, or...a rebirth of his love for Elizabeth". Linda Troost and Sayre Greenfield wrote that the scene [...] "tells us more about our current decade's obsession with physical perfection and acceptance of gratuitous nudity than it <b>does</b> <b>about</b> Austen's Darcy, but the image carves a new facet into the text".|$|E

I think part of the element of Darla is how strong she is and how fierce she can be and Lisa definitely adds to that element. I would be a doing huge disservice to Darla if I didn’t allow her to do the work that she does and to help add to that element that’s so important to Darla, which is her strength." ...|$|E

500|$|Fear of Scientology's {{litigiousness}} rendered American networks {{unwilling to}} license any {{material to the}} filmmakers, which Gibney found [...] "astounding". He commented that he [...] "found it interesting that universally this subject — {{more than any other}} — provoked all the networks to decline to license. I {{think at the end of}} the day, that tells you more about Scientology than it <b>does</b> <b>about</b> the networks, which is how ruthless they've been in trying to silence any criticism." [...] The church's reputation for harassing its critics made it necessary for Gibney to use burner phones to contact interviewees and film in secret: [...] "Sometimes for the on-camera interviews we'd set up gear in somebody's house and I'd make sure I'd be there hours before. Then the person would show up there so it was like they were just going to somebody’s house." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the song's {{commercial}} success, [...] "We Are the World" [...] received {{mixed reviews}} from journalists, music critics {{and the public}} following its release. American journalist Greil Marcus felt that the song sounded like a Pepsi jingle. He wrote, [...] "... the constant repetition of 'There's a choice we're making' conflates with Pepsi's trademarked 'The choice of a new generation' in a way that, {{on the part of}} Pepsi-contracted song writers Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, is certainly not intentional, and even more certainly beyond the realm of serendipity." [...] Marcus added, [...] "In the realm of contextualization, 'We Are the World' says less about Ethiopia than it <b>does</b> <b>about</b> Pepsi—and the true result will likely be less that certain Ethiopian individuals will live, or anyway live a bit longer than they otherwise would have, than that Pepsi will get the catch phrase of its advertising campaign sung for free by Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, and all the rest." [...] Author Reebee Garofalo agreed, and expressed the opinion that the line [...] "We're saving our own lives" [...] was a [...] "distasteful element of self-indulgence". He asserted that the artists of USA for Africa were proclaiming [...] "their own salvation for singing about an issue they will never experience on behalf of a people most of them will never encounter".|$|E
500|$|The New York Times Stephen Holden gave a mixed review {{saying the}} film [...] "does a better-than-average job of {{conveying}} the panic and helplessness of men terrorized by a sadist in a degrading environment, {{but it is}} still not especially scary. What sets its demon apart from run-of-the-mill movie serial killers is his impulse to humiliate and torture his victims and justify it with some twisted morality." [...] He said the film is [...] "seriously undermined by the half-baked, formulaic detective story in which the horror is framed." [...] Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times also gave the film a mixed review saying, [...] "Saw is so full of twists it ends up getting snarled. For all of his flashy engineering and inventive torture scenarios, the Jigsaw Killer comes across as an amateur. Hannibal Lecter would have him for lunch." [...] She said the film [...] "carelessly underscores its own shaky narrative at every turn with its mid-budget hokiness." [...] She also noted that Elwes and Whannell had trouble keeping an American accent. Another mixed review came from Roger Ebert, who gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and lamented the gimmicks and plot contrivances but nonetheless described Saw as [...] "well made and acted, and does what it <b>does</b> <b>about</b> as well as it could be expected to." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Historia Ecclesiastica {{has more}} to say about episcopal events than it <b>does</b> <b>about</b> the monasteries of England. Bede does shed some light on monastic affairs; in {{particular}} he comments in book V that many Northumbrians are laying aside their arms and entering monasteries [...] "rather than study the arts of war. What the result of this will be the future will show." [...] This veiled comment, another example of Bede's discretion in commenting on current affairs, could be interpreted as ominous given Bede's more specific criticism of quasi-monasteries in his letter to Ecgberht, written three years later.|$|E
2500|$|More {{recent work}} has debated the {{suitability}} of the term cargo cult arguing {{that it does not}} refer to an identifiable empirical reality, and that the emphasis on [...] "cargo" [...] says more about Western ideological bias than it <b>does</b> <b>about</b> the movements concerned. Nancy McDowell argues that the focus on cargo cult isolates the phenomenon from the wider social and cultural field (such as politics and economics) that gives it meaning. She states that people experience change as dramatic and complete, rather than as gradual and evolutionary. This sense of a dramatic break is expressed through cargo cult ideology.|$|E
2500|$|In woodworking, surforms {{are used}} for rapidly {{removing}} wood from curved surfaces. They remove less wood than a drawknife, so they are easier to control. Even though surforms leave very coarse finishes, the worked areas can be easily smoothed with finer tools, such as files and sanding blocks. Woodworker Sam Maloof described their use in chairmaking: [...] "Once I have roughed out the arm on the bandsaw, I use a Surform® (Stanley® model No. 295). This tool <b>does</b> <b>about</b> the same job as a spokeshave -- it can take {{off a lot of}} wood very quickly -- but I can use it without worrying about grain direction." ...|$|E

Saxby Chambliss echoed Shelby's sentiments, saying [...] "I feel exactly as Senator Shelby <b>does</b> <b>about</b> the Banking Committee negotiations.", but voiced his concern about maintaining an active derivatives market and not driving financial firms overseas. Kay Bailey Hutchison indicated her desire to see state banks {{have access to the}} Fed, while Orrin Hatch had concerns over transparency, and the lack of Fannie and Freddy reform.|$|E
2500|$|Burr's weight, {{always an}} issue for him in getting roles, became a public {{relations}} problem when Johnny Carson began making jokes about him during his Tonight Show monologues. Burr refused to appear as Carson's guest from then on, and told Us Weekly years later: [...] "I have been asked {{a number of times}} to do his show and I won't do it. Because I like NBC. He's doing an NBC show. If I went on I'd have some things to say, not just about the bad jokes he's done about me, but bad jokes he <b>does</b> <b>about</b> everybody who can't fight back because they aren't there. And that wouldn't be good for NBC." [...] In later life, his distinctive physique and manner {{could be used as a}} reference that would be universally recognized. One journal for librarians published a writer's opinion that [...] "asking persons without cataloging experience to design automated catalogs … is as practical as asking Raymond Burr to pole vault." [...] A character in a 1989 short story refers to Burr as [...] "grossly overweight" [...] in Ironside.|$|E
