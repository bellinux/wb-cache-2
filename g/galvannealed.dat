40|$|<b>Galvanneal</b> {{steel is}} {{considered}} to be better for automotive applications than its counterpart, galvanized steel, mainly because of its superior coating and surface properties. <b>Galvanneal</b> steel is produced by hot dipping sheet steel in a bath of molten zinc with small, controlled, levels of aluminium, followed by annealing which creates a Fe-Zn intermetallic layer. This intermetallic layer of the coating improves spot weldability and improves subsequent paint appearance. However, if the microstructure of the coating is not properly controlled and forming parameters are not properly selected, wear of the coating could occur during stamping. Frictional sliding of the sheet between the tool surfaces results in considerable amount of coating loss. An Interstitial Free steel with a <b>Galvanneal</b> coating of nominally 60 g/m 2 was used for the laboratory experiments. Flat Face Friction (FFF) tests were performed with different forming conditions and lubricants to simulate the frictional sliding in stamping.

50|$|Production of <b>galvannealed</b> {{sheet steel}} begins with hot dip {{galvanization}} of sheet steel. After passing through the galvanizing zinc bath the sheet steel passes through air knives to remove excess zinc, and is then heated in an annealing furnace for several seconds causing iron and zinc layers to diffuse into one another causing the formation of zinc-iron alloy layers at the surface. The annealing step is performed with the strip still hot after the galvanizing step, with the zinc still liquid. The galvanising bath contains slightly over 0.1% aluminium, added to form a layer bonding between the iron and coated zinc. Annealing temperatures are around 500 to 565 °C. Pre-1990 annealing lines used gas-fired heating; post-1990s the use of induction furnaces became common.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of the exposure to humidity and UV radiation (UVCON test) of an organic coating (lacquer) containing chromating reagents applied on galvanised steel, <b>galvanneal</b> and galfan substrates. An attempt is made to establish possible relationships between the degradation of the lacquered surface during its exposure and {{the presence or absence of}} alloying elements on the original zinc-based substrate. With the galvanised steel and galfan coatings, 60 days of exposure to the UVCON test are necessary for a slight reduction in the lacquer content to be observed. Removal of the lacquer leaves the Cr(III) formed on the surface of the zinc-based substrate exposed. With the galfan coating, the chromate layer grows on the initial aluminium oxide film. With the <b>galvanneal</b> coating, in contrast to the lacquered galvanised steel and galfan, 15 days are sufficient for detachment of the lacquer to be observed. Longer exposure times lead to an appreciable increase in the percentage of lacquer removed. Surprisingly, the chromate layer remains on the surface of the <b>galvanneal</b> coating, preventing its corrosion, even after 60 days of exposure. XPS data suggest the presence of Cr-O-C type bonds at the interface, due to the oxidation of the lacquer surface associated with the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), which contribute significantly to the increase in lacquer adhesion. © 2003 Elsevier B.

Acceptable welding conditions were determined {{as a function of}} the resistance spot welding process parameters such as electrode force, welding time, and welding current. The lower limit of the welding lobe was the minimum shear tension strength for 590 MPa-grade steel while the upper limit was determined whether or not expulsion was detected.

In the present study, the surface defect was characterized by visual inspection, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopic analysis to understand the source and mechanism of the defect. In the visual inspection, these peculiar surface appearances were observed in fuel tank at three distinct locations. The SEM examination exhibited two distinct regions {{on the surface}} apart from the normal galvanized surface: (1) <b>galvannealed,</b> (2) mixture of galvanized and <b>galvannealed</b> texture.

40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to {{establish}} possible relationships between the quantity of oxides and hydroxides of the alloying elements on the outer interstitial-free steel surface after the annealing process and {{the characteristics of the}} <b>galvanneal</b> coating formed. XPS measurements reflect a clear influence of the alloying element contents and the water vapour content or dew point (DP) of the atmosphere on the oxide and hydroxide coverage of the steel surface. In general, much less Fe–Zn intermetallic formation is seen on the Ti steel substrate than on the Ti–Nb steel. The reason for this may be related with the higher oxide/(Fe + Mn) atomic ratio on the external surface of the Ti steel substrate. With the Ti–Nb–P steel, an absence of Fe was observed in the coatings obtained on the surface of this steel annealed in atmospheres with a DP of − 45 or − 10 °C. A clear direct relationship has been found between the inhibition of growth of Fe–Zn intermetallic compounds and the fraction of the steel substrate surface covered by manganese oxides {{as a result of the}} annealing process. For the Ti–Nb–P steel the increase in the DP of the <b>galvannealing</b> atmosphere to 10 °C resulted in the incorporation of a significant Fe content in the coating.

These rapid emissivity changes preclude standard radiometric measurement techniques. The objectives of the research were to explore the behavior of the spectral emissivity during the process as influenced by the heating cycle and metallurgical properties of the product and to develop an appropriate dual-wavelength emissivity compensation algorithm to accurately infer temperature. ^ The <b>galvanneal</b> process was simulated in the laboratory for 63 samples, and in situ emissivity and temperature data were obtained using a dual-wavelength radiation thermometer at spectral bands of 2. 18 and 2. 4 μm. <b>Galvanneal</b> temperatures simulated ranged from 753 - 833 K.

A modified approach examined splitting the data into three sets corresponding to specific process conditions, each with its own compensation equation, and using these equations in a similar algorithm. This approach performed slightly better than the first, more global approach, but does require knowledge of process conditions in addition to spectral radiance data. A final, completely new approach, utilized an adaptive technique for adjusting the compensation equation within the algorithm according to the behavior of the data being measured.

The feasibility of depositing a surface coating onto Cu/Cr electrodes to mitigate the formation of alloy layers and thus extend electrode life was also investigated. Physical vapour deposition of Cr using unbalanced magnetron sputtering and filtered arc evaporation extended the life of Cu/Cr electrodes by 100 % from approximately 420 to 840 welds when welding Al- 45 %Zn sheet steel. Although extension of electrode tip life was achieved it has been established that the life determining failure mechanism of coated electrodes is by gross plastic deformation of the electrode tip due to the extreme temperatures and repeated compressive forces generated during the welding operation. It is therefore proposed that future work should aim to improve the mechanical properties of the electrode material in order to provide a strong base capable of supporting a thin liquid metal resistant coating.
