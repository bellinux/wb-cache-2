500|$|The Sindy doll {{entered the}} digital world in 2000 when Pedigree Toys {{introduced}} an official website. Monitor Media, the website design company, said, [...] "Sindy.com brings Sindy {{to life for}} six-year-old girls <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> grips with computers while sitting on their Mum's knee. They can dress her up, paint her bedroom in different colours, read her secret diary, chat with other Sindy fans and send her e-mails".|$|E
500|$|After {{reforming}} {{in early}} 2009, Blink-182 toured worldwide {{and the group}} released its sixth studio album, Neighborhoods (2011). The band members recorded {{the majority of the}} album on their own in different studios, resulting in an extension of the bandmates' miscommunication and tension. The trio parted ways with their record label, Interscope in 2012, later self-releasing an extended play, Dogs Eating Dogs, that holiday season. Plans for a seventh Blink-182 album were delayed numerous times, reportedly due to guitarist Tom DeLonge's involvement in his other group, Angels & Airwaves, as well as other projects. In the interim, the band mounted an anniversary tour for its self-titled fifth album, and headlined the Reading and Leeds festivals. By the time DeLonge spoke to Rock Sound in November 2014, there was still little work completed on the album: [...] "We're <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> that point of starting... there's no timeline at the moment." [...] By the time a record deal was finalized one month later, DeLonge backed out of recording and performing commitments by email—which led bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker to seek legal separation from him in what Hoppus described as a [...] "friendly divorce" [...] from DeLonge.|$|E

6000|$|... "Simultaneously {{with the}} sinking of the vessel," [...] the E11 goes on, [...] "smoke was {{observed}} to the eastward." [...] It was a steamer who had seen the explosion and was running for Rodosto. E11 chased her till she tied up to Rodosto pier, and then torpedoed her where she lay--a heavily laden store-ship piled high with packing-cases. The water was shallow here, and though E11 bumped along the bottom, which does not make for steadiness of aim, she was forced to show a good deal of her only periscope, and had it dented, but not damaged by rifle-fire from the beach. As she moved out of Rodosto Bay she saw a paddle-boat loaded with barbed wire, which stopped on the hail, but [...] "as we ranged alongside her, attempted to ram us, but failed owing to our superior speed." [...] Then she ran for the beach [...] "very skilfully," [...] keeping her stern to E11 till she drove ashore beneath some cliffs. The demolition-squad were <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> work when [...] "a party of horsemen appeared on the cliffs above and opened a hot fire on the conning tower." [...] E11 got out, but owing to the shoal water it was some time before she could get under enough to fire a torpedo. The stern of a stranded paddle-boat is no great target and the thing exploded on the beach. Then she [...] "recharged batteries and proceeded slowly on the surface towards Constantinople." [...] All this between the ordinary office hours of 10 A.M. and 4 P.M.|$|E
