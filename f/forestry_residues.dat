A proposed cellulosic ethanol biorefinery in Sweden was simulated with Aspen Plus. The plant was assumed to convert different forestry assortments (sawdust and shavings, fuel logs, early thinnings, tops and branches, hog fuel and pulpwood) to ethanol, pellets, biogas and electricity. The intention was not to obtain absolute ethanol production costs for future facilities, but to assess and compare the future potential of utilizing different <b>forestry</b> <b>residues</b> for bioethanol production.

Under the basic assumptions, all the <b>forestry</b> <b>residues</b> apart from sawdust and shavings exhibited a negative net present value at current market prices. The profitability decreased with increasing bark content of the raw material.

40|$|Abstract: Biomass (roundwood, {{agricultural}} residues, <b>forestry</b> <b>residues,</b> organic municipal waste) has {{the largest}} carbon reserve with potential to replace unsustainable fossil energy sources. Furthermore, off grid communities produce significant amounts of loose biomass through agricultural and forestry activities. These include maize stalks, tobacco stalks, ground nut leaves and stalks, tree leaves, elephant grass etc. These are traditionally burnt in fields after harvesting. In addition, annually, <b>forestry</b> <b>residues</b> such as elephant grass, yellow thatching grass, dry tree leaves etc. are destroyed in perennial veld fires. Such loose biomass can be harnessed for cooking and heating and thus minimise the use of round wood, which results in defor! estation that cause desertification if not done sustainably. The major challenge in harnessing energy from loose biomass is their low energy density. This can be overcome by developing loose biomass briquetting technologies. This paper reports {{on the development of}} loose biomass briquetting technologies at the University of Johannesburg over the past five years. These include shredding, pre-treatment, compaction, off grid solar drying, and combustion. Briquetting required the selection of good feed stock and binders. Cow dung and cactus leaves were found to be good binders producing briquettes with good combustion behaviour. The developed loose biomass briquettes were tested for moisture content, energy content and combustion behaviour and were found to be adequate for domestic cooking and heating requirements...|$|E

Null and negative effects of biochar on growth were found in most cases. One potential cause for null and negative plant responses to biochar is plant exposure to mobile compounds produced during pyrolysis that leach or evolve following additions of biochars to soil. In a second glasshouse experiment we {{examined the effects of}} simple leaching and heating techniques to ameliorate potentially phytotoxic effects of volatile and leachable compounds released from biochar. We used Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) –gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to qualitatively describe organic compounds in both biochar (through headspace extraction), and in the water leachates (through direct injection). Convection heating and water leaching of biochar prior to application alleviated growth inhibition. Additionally, growth was inhibited when filtrate from water-leached biochar was applied following germination. SPME-GC-MS detected primarily short-chained carboxylic acids and phenolics in both the leachates and solid chars, with relatively high concentrations of several known phytotoxic compounds including acetic acid, butyric acid, 2, 4 -di-tert-butylphenol and benzoic acid. We speculate that variable plant responses to phytotoxic organic compounds leached from biochars may largely explain negative plant growth responses and also account for strongly species-specific patterns of plant responses to biochar amendments in short-term experiments...|$|R
