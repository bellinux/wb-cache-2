40|$|The {{effect of}} daily oral {{administration}} of flumethrin on the tissue enzyme activity on albino rats was investigated. In {{the present study}} twenty albino Wister rats were used and divided into two groups. The first group (10 rats) served as the control group; the second group (10 rats) {{both male and female}} received flumethrin (1 % pour on formulation) at the rate of 5 mg/kg bw orally daily for 14 days. On day 15, animals were sacrificed and liver tissue samples were collected. Flumethrin leads to increased MDA, ALT, AST levels and decreased catalase, SOD and protein level.

40|$|In {{clinical}} practice hepatic coma is not in-frequent; usually {{it is due}} to <b>hepato-toxic</b> drugs, severe infective hepatitis and portal cirrhosis. Drug allergy giving rise to the same phenomenonis uncommon, though cases of jaundice following PAS therapy have been recorded (Cuthbart, I 950; McKendrick, 1951; Mann, 1953).

40|$|Hepatocyte (HPC) {{apoptosis}} {{occurs in}} association with <b>hepato-toxic</b> responses and chronic liver disease, and is coupled to activa-tion of the blood coagulation cascade. HPCs {{have been shown to}} ex-press tissue factor (TF), the primary activator of blood coagulation, in a form that lacks procoagulant activity. In this study, we deter-mined the effect of inducingHPCapoptosis on the procoagulant ac-tivity of TF. Treatment of primary mouse HPCs with the Fas death receptor agonist (anti-CD 95 antibody, Jo 2) triggered apoptosis as shown by cleavage of caspase- 3, increased caspase- 3 proteolytic ac-tivity, and cell surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS). Jo 2 -induced apoptosis significantly increased TF-dependent factor Xa generation by HPCs. Moreover, Jo 2 treatment was associated with increased levels of microparticle-associated TF procoagulant activ-ity in the culture medium. Pretreatment with a caspase- 3 inhibitor significantly reduced Jo 2 -induced HPC TF activity and prevente...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition of canalicular {{bile acid}} efflux by {{medications}} is asso-ciated with clinical liver toxicity, {{sometimes in the}} absence of major liver effects in experimental species. To predict the <b>hepato-toxic</b> potential of compounds in vitro and in vivo, we investigated the effect of clinical cholestatic agents on [3 H]taurocholic acid transport in regular and collagen-sandwich cultured human hepa-tocytes. Hepatocytes established a well-developed canalicular net-work with bile acid accumulating in the canalicular lumen within 15 min of addition to cells. Removing Ca 2 and Mg 2 from the incubation buffer destroyed canalicular junctions, resulting in bile acid efflux into the incubation buffer. Canalicular transport was calculated based on the difference between the amount of bile acid effluxed into the Ca/Mg 2 -free and regular buffers with linear efflux up to 10 min. Hepatocytes cultured in the nonsandwich configuration also transported taurocholic acid, but at 50 % th...|$|E
40|$|International audience'Alarmins' are a {{group of}} {{proteins}} or molecules that are released from cells during cellular demise to alert the host immune system. Two of them, Interleukin- 33 (IL- 33) and high-mobility group box- 1 (HMGB 1), share many similarities of cellular localization, functions and involvement in various inflammatory pathologies including hepatitis. The expressions of IL- 33 and HMGB 1, and their receptors ST 2 and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), are substantially up-regulated during acute and chronic hepatitis. Recent data evidence a possible protective role of IL- 33 /ST 2 axis during liver injury. A contrast in expression of IL- 33 and HMGB 1 alarmins were associated with type of hepatocellular death mediated by immune cells or <b>hepato-toxic</b> agents. The massive release of active form of IL- 33 from hepatocytes may affect the recruitment and activation of its ST 2 -positive target immune cells in the liver to confer its alarmin functions. This review highlights the emerging roles of alarmin proteins in various liver pathologies, by focusing on classical HMGB 1 and a newly discovered alarmin, the IL- 33...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the hepatoprotective activity of Limonia acidisssima leaves (LAL) and flowers of Clitoria ternatae (CTF) in experimental animals. Materials and Methods: The leaves and flowers {{of the selected}} plant were shade dried and the plant extract was prepared by using soxhlet apparatus using the solvent ethanol at constant temperature and it {{was used for the}} invivo work. Biochemical parameters like bilirubin, albumin, total protein, transaminase, phosphatase and LPO were tested in carbon tetra chloride induced experimental animals were tested. Results: The ethanolic plant extract of both plant parts (leaves of LA and flowers of CT) were found to be effective against the carbon tetra chloride induced hepatotoxicity in experimental male albino rats. The results shows the elevated level of total protein, albumin, liver glycogen and reduced level of phosphatase, transaminase, lipid peroxide enzyme, and bilirubin than the carbon tetra chloride treated experimental animals. Conclusion: The leaves of Limonia acidisssima and flowers Clitoria ternatae has the efficacy to protect against <b>hepato-toxic</b> disease and hepatic necrosis may due to the presence of phyto-constituents present in it.

40|$|AbstractCiprofloxacin, a broad-spectrum {{antimicrobial}} agent {{belonging to the}} fluoroquinolone family, is prescribed off-label in infants {{less than one year}} of age. Ciprofloxacin is included in the European Medicines Agency priority list of off-patent medicinal products requiring evaluation in neonates. This evaluation is undergoing within the TINN (Treat Infections in Neonates) FP 7 EU project. As part of the TINN project, the present preclinical study was designed to assess the potential adverse effects of Ciprofloxacin on neurodevelopment, liver and joints in mice. Newborn mice received subcutaneous Ciprofloxacin at 10, 30 and 100  mg/kg/day from 2 to 12 postnatal days. Peak plasma levels of Ciprofloxacin were in the range of levels measured in human neonates. We examined vital functions in vivo, including cardiorespiratory parameters and temperature, psychomotor development, exploratory behavior, arthro-, nephro- and <b>hepato-toxic</b> effects. We found no effect of Ciprofloxacin at 10 and 30  mg/kg/day. In contrast, administration at 100  mg/kg/day delayed weight gain, impaired cardiorespiratory and psychomotor development, caused inflammatory infiltrates in the connective tissues surrounding the knee joint, and moderately increased extramedullary hematopoiesis. The present study pleads for careful watching of cardiorespiratory and motor development in neonates treated with Ciprofloxacin, in addition to the standard surveillance of arthrotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted at the International Livestock Research Institute's Debre Zeit Research Station in Ethiopia. Leucaena pallida 14203, Sesbania sesban 1198 and Lablab purpureus were grown, harvested and dried at the research station. Seventy individually penned Menz ewes with a mean initial weight of 18. 6 +/- 0. 41 kg (mean+/-S. D.) were used in a randomized block design experiment that lasted for 6 months. Treatments consisted of supplementing ewes with L. pallida 14203 or S. sesban 1198 at 0. 9 %, 1. 2 % or 1. 5 % of live weight (LW). L. purpureus, offered at 1. 2 % of LW {{was used as a}} positive control. The basal feed tef straw (Eragrostis tef) was offered at 20 % of refusal. Data on feed intake, LW gain, reproductive parameters and plasma activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), [gamma]-glutamyletransferase ([gamma]-GT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were collected and analyzed. Graded levels of L. pallida 14203 promoted superior intakes of basal feed dry matter (DM) (PPPS. sesban 1198. Intake of basal feed DM was higher (PL. pallida 14203.

40|$|Metformin is {{the first}} choice oralantidiabetic drug for type 2 dia-betes and {{currently}} the most con-sumed. Althoughgastrointestinal intolerance is frequent, metformin-induced hepato-toxicity is rare. Fewer than 10 cases have been reported (1). In all of those cases, metformin was associated with concomi-tant intake of other potentially <b>hepato-toxic</b> drugs. We present what we feel {{may be the first}} documented case of hep-atotoxicity due to metformin with no other drug interference. A 61 -year-old man was admitted to the hospital with a 3 -day history of painless jaundice. He had no history of liver disease or toxic habits and denied previous con-sumption of drugs or herbal products, but had been taking metformin (1, 700 mg/day for 6 weeks) after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Laboratory tests showed a mixed pattern of liver damage (total bilirubin 2. 9 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 2. 4 mg/dL, as-partate aminotransferase [AST] 290 units/L [# 40], alanine aminotransferase [ALT] 861 units/L [# 35], g-glutamyltransferase [GGT] 861 units/L [# 35], and alkaline phosphatase [ALP] 622 units/L [# 120]). International normalized ratio and eosin-ophil counts were normal. Diagnostic work-up ruled out viral hepatitis A, B, and C, as well as autoimmune and meta-bolic liver disease (negative antinuclear antibodies, anti-mitochondrial antibod-ies, smooth muscle antibodies, anti-liver/ kidney microsomal antibodies; normal ceruloplasmin, a- 1 antitrypsin, cop-per). Abdominal ultrasound and chol-angio-MRI showed no pathological find-ings. The patient refused a liver biopsy. After stopping metformin, the patient’s clinical condition progressively im-proved and liver enzymes normalized in 30 days. He was discharged with only recommendations to modify his lifestyle. Six weeks after discharge, the pa-tient again developed malaise, nausea, and jaundice 24 h after deciding on his own to take a dose of 850 mg of metformin.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that hepatocytes cultured in a {{collagen}} sandwich configuration maintain cell viability, morphology, and drug metabolizing activities for several weeks. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize chemically induced general toxicity in this system by exposing hepatocytes to eight different <b>hepato-toxic</b> compounds. Cell function and viability was measured by analyzing the secretions of urea and albumin and the release of lactate dehydrogenase. Significant decreases in urea and albumin secretions were detected after treatments with 32 nM aflatoxin B 1 and 1 mM doses of cadmium and the alkylating agents N-methyl-N’-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and methyl meth-ane sulfonate (MMS). However, no significant toxicity could be measured following exposures to 5 mM carbon tetrachloride, 1 mM N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 1 mM vinyl acetate, and 1 mM acetaminophen. Western blots of cell lysates showed that hepatocytes maintained CYP 1 A, 2 B, 3 A 2 but gradually lost CYP 2 E 1, which is the main metabolic enzyme for acetaminophen, carbon tetrachloride, and DMF. The metabolites of acetamino-phen were identified using liquid chromatography and electro-spray mass spectrometry. It was determined that the hepatocytes converted most of the acetaminophen to the glucuronide and sulfate metabolites and only formed a small amount of the glutathione adduct. This research shows that the collagen sandwich culture system can only be used selectively for detecting hepatotoxicity and for identifying major metabolites of xenobiotic compounds. Key Words: toxicity; collagen; sandwich; hepatocytes; aflatoxin; acetaminophen. Cultured hepatocytes rapidly lose liver-specific functions, which limits their use for studying drug metabolism and toxicity. This phenomenon is thought to be due to the lack of proper extracellular matrix, cell-cell contacts, and humoral factors in the in vitro systems, which are known to regulate gene expression in the liver (Ben Ze#ev et al., 1988; Gomez...|$|E
40|$|In the {{preceding}} report, the author studied the changes of tissue mast cells (TMC) in the specimens of liver biopsy specimens of viral hepatitis. The {{present study was}} attempted to confirm, by animal experiments, the data described in the previous report. Animals used were male dogs, mice and rabbits. Chloroform and carbon tetrachloride were administrated for experimental damage of the liver tissue. The experiments gave the following results: 1. TMC were found both in intralobular and periportal region of the liver. Destructive processes such as dispersion, degranulation, destruction and condensation of the granule in TMC were found in {{an early stage of}} the liver damage. A marked increase in number and morphological changes of TMC as the remarkable proliferation of the connective tissue in periportal and intralobular regions were noted in such chronic stage. 2. A marked decrease in number and remarkable morphological changes of TMC were observed in the cases on an adrenocorticosteroid hormon therapy. 3. TMC were chiefly found in the periportal region of rat's liver, and a increase in number and morphological changes were found when the connective tissue increased in the periportal field after long-term administration of <b>hepato-toxic</b> drugs. 4. The asministration of the adrenal cortical hormones induced a marked decrease in number and destractive and condensed chages of TMC granules at this stage. 5. Administrations of the remedies for liver damage such as glucronic acid, thioctic acid, multi-vitamines and communin induced a slight increase in mumber and slight changes in the morphological findings comparing with control groups. The only remarkable change were the condensation of TMC granules. 6. Only a few TMC were found in rabbit's liver, and there were minimal or no changes in TMC, even in the stage of marked damage of the liver tissue. 7. These results lead to the following conculsions: There is a close relation between the proliferation of the connective tissue in dog's and rat's liver and the changes of TMC...|$|E
