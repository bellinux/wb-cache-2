5|$|The first lengthy {{report of}} torture by the Chicago police was {{published}} beginning in January 1990 {{in the alternative}} weekly Chicago Reader.

5|$|After a touch-line {{argument}} with then-club captain Gareth Owen, Gannon gave a forthright interview explaining that <b>disciplinary</b> <b>action</b> would be taken, and Owen would be stripped of the captaincy. Owen, who was later {{released by the}} club, did not play another game for County. Meanwhile, Gannon was left threatening police action over a strong challenge that left Stockport striker Matty McNeil unconscious and in hospital.|$|E
5|$|Blount called Hout and Petersen to {{apologize}} on September 5. Kelly {{participated in the}} calls.

40|$|Abstract The {{current study}} {{longitudinally}} investigated relations between proactive (goal-oriented, calculated) and reactive (response to perceived threat) aggression and <b>disciplinary</b> <b>actions</b> in an after-school care {{program in a}} sample of 147 school-age children (Mean age = 8. 22 years; 54. 4 % male). In addition, perceived best friend delinquency was examined as a moderator of the relations between proactive and reactive aggression and <b>disciplinary</b> <b>actions.</b> As expected, high levels of proactive aggression were associated with high levels of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>actions.</b> Reactive aggression, in contrast, was negatively associated with <b>disciplinary</b> <b>actions</b> 2 -months later. Finally, perceived best friend delinquency moderated the association between proactive, but not reactive, aggression and <b>disciplinary</b> <b>actions.</b> However, this interaction effect was only marginally statistically significant (p=. 06). Implications for findings and future directions are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Nan Chiau High School {{is known}} for its strict {{regulations}} and discipline, with minimal tolerance to misbehaviour of its students. In 2004 the school gained attention for its <b>disciplinary</b> <b>action</b> on a student over misconduct, which was deemed overly harsh. This came despite the backing of many alumni, educators and parents stressing that the action taken was justified.|$|E
5|$|Pollard was at {{the center}} of a small brawl with the San Francisco 49ers in their game on September 28, 1953. The brawl erupted in the fourth quarter, when San Francisco's Charley Powell squared off against Pollard. The Eagles ended up losing 31-21, and Pollard {{received}} no <b>disciplinary</b> <b>action,</b> although Powell was ejected.|$|E
5|$|While she was incarcerated at HM Prison Durham, {{a routine}} {{security}} check in 1996 uncovered letters which revealed McNeilly {{had been having}} an affair with the prison governor, Mike Martin. The married officer resigned his position before <b>disciplinary</b> <b>action</b> could be taken. McNeilly, who was sharing a wing with Rosemary West and Myra Hindley, was immediately transferred to HM Prison New Hall.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to look at}} various {{characteristics}} of institutions of higher learning in conjunction with each institution’s number of arrests and internal <b>disciplinary</b> <b>actions</b> for drug and liquor law violations. The goal is to determine correlations between these characteristics and the arrests and internal <b>disciplinary</b> <b>actions.</b> While a lot of studies have looked at data collected from student surveys, this one collects data that is self-reported by each institution. It is found that there are some school characteristics, especially percent of applicants admitted, that correspond to a higher number of arrests and internal <b>disciplinary</b> <b>actions...</b>|$|R

5|$|After {{his release}} from prison in 2010, Chen was placed under house arrest against Chinese law, and was closely {{monitored}} by security forces. Legally, he was proclaimed {{by the government to}} be a free man, but in reality the local government offered no explanation for the hundreds of unidentified agents monitoring his house and preventing visitors or escape. The national propaganda organ, the Global Times, expressed confusion over the issue, and suggested that the local government may not know how to handle it, but no <b>disciplinary</b> <b>action</b> was taken at the national level.|$|E
5|$|Gil Stein, {{president}} of the NHL, indicated that the league would not take <b>disciplinary</b> <b>action</b> against Aubut, and the Rangers did not challenge the arbitrator's decision. Stein further stated that as of August 1, all trades needed to be confirmed with the league office by all involved parties before they would be considered consummated. Lindros signed a five-year contract with the Flyers worth an estimated $24million. As a rookie, he earned $2million, while Gretzky, with the largest NHL contract, earned $3million. Lindros did not accompany the Flyers to Quebec for an exhibition game prior to the 1992–93 season due to concern about the reception he would receive. Hextall and Ricci initially {{did not want to}} report to Quebec, but relented.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Parkinson {{was made}} {{commander}} of the Royal New Zealand Artillery, having been made a temporary lieutenant colonel. He was demoted to major the following year; this reduction in rank was {{as a result of}} <b>disciplinary</b> <b>action</b> after using the workshop facilities at Trentham Military Camp for personal work. In 1939, he was returned to his temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. A lot of his work as {{commander of the}} artillery involved the implementing programs for the upskilling of gunners and non-commissioned officers to perform leadership roles normally the preserve of officers. Likewise, officers were expected to learn basic gunnery tasks.|$|E

The USAF did not reveal whether any other officer involved in the chain of events leading to the crash received any type of administrative or <b>disciplinary</b> <b>action.</b> Critics of USAF's safety record stated that this crash was an example of a pattern of problems related to enforcement of safety procedures within USAF.|$|E
5|$|That Chandler {{supported}} Robinson and {{the integration}} of baseball is evidenced by his actions during the 1947 season. First and foremost, as commissioner, Chandler {{had the power to}} void Robinson's contract, but he chose to approve it. Further, following extreme, race-based jeering at Robinson by the Philadelphia Phillies and their manager, Ben Chapman, Chandler threatened both the team and Chapman personally with <b>disciplinary</b> <b>action</b> for any future incidents of race-based taunting. Later that season, he decisively supported Ford Frick's decision to indefinitely suspend any members of the St. Louis Cardinals who followed through on a threat to strike in protest of integration.|$|E
5|$|While Shay was {{managing}} at Kansas City in early 1910, American Association president Thomas Chivington imposed new conduct {{rules for the}} league. The new system emphasized fines for players and managers rather than simply ejecting them when they behaved poorly. After Shay was ejected from three games in a four-game span, a Minnesota newspaper article questioned whether his behavior {{would be subject to}} additional <b>disciplinary</b> <b>action.</b> The next month, Shay released 48-year-old Jake Beckley, prompting his retirement after one of the longest careers in professional baseball history. The first baseman had tried to make the Kansas City team after 20 years in the National League.|$|E

5|$|Yugoslav Ministry of Defence {{announced}} that it had initiated criminal proceedings against an officer, with four other officers facing military <b>disciplinary</b> <b>action.</b> The commander of the Yugoslav Air Force, Colonel General Zvonko Jurjević was suspended. The federal defense minister, General Veljko Kadijević officially apologized for the incident and resigned his post. Šišić was court-martialled in Belgrade in 1992, and acquitted based on claims that he shot at a ZNG helicopter illegally escorting the two ECMM helicopters. In a 2008 interview, Šišić claimed that the ECMM helicopter crashed after {{being hit by a}} fireball caused by the exploding third helicopter. His account is contradicted by crash scene eyewitnesses, as well as Željava Air Base radar data, both of which indicate that only two aircraft were flying to Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|Drogba {{suffered}} {{a string of}} injuries {{early on in the}} 2008–09 season and struggled to regain fitness, missing games from August to November due to knee problems. He scored his first goal of the season in mid-November but there was little reason to celebrate: he incurred <b>disciplinary</b> <b>action</b> and a three-match ban for throwing a coin back into the stands and Chelsea {{suffered a}} League Cup defeat against Burnley. Drogba scored his second goal of the season in a 2–1 victory against CFR Cluj in the UEFA Champions League, while his first Premier League goal of the season came in a 2–0 win against West Bromwich Albion in late December 2008. Having missed many games through injury and suspension, Drogba had lost his first team place and manager Scolari favoured playing Nicolas Anelka as a lone striker rather than pairing the two. However, he resolved to regain his position in the squad.|$|E
5|$|During June, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that Miller's squadron would be deployed to Burma {{to fight against}} Japan. In the meantime, the airmen continued to practice their flying, Miller earning Reeves' ire by making unauthorised leisure flights. Later, {{he was ordered to}} fly tour flights over Germany. Not wanting to do so, Miller lodged bogus reports saying that the Mosquitoes were malfunctioning, causing unnecessary maintenance work. Thus, Reeves ordered Miller to take his plane instead, which caught fire in mid-flight. With one functional engine and no navigator to assist him, Miller came back to the air base and bellylanded. The fuselage and one of the wings was broken off and the plane became engulfed in flames. Miller escaped physical injury, but was shaken by the accident. Again Miller escaped <b>disciplinary</b> <b>action,</b> and was playing sport an hour later.|$|E

5|$|For {{the second}} time in his career, Costa was an unused {{substitute}} as Atlético won the UEFA Super Cup on 1 September 2012. That December, Costa was involved in several on-field altercations in two separate matches. The first was in a 0–2 local derby loss against Real Madrid where he avoided <b>disciplinary</b> <b>action</b> after spitting incidents between him and Sergio Ramos. He was sent off in the following game at Viktoria Plzeň in the UEFA Europa League for headbutting opponent David Limberský, and was handed a four-match ban by UEFA. This, however, did not deter coach Diego Simeone from continuing to start him, and he responded by netting three goals in two home contests, against Deportivo de La Coruña in the league (6–0) and Getafe in the season's Copa del Rey (3–0).|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, he {{was made}} joint {{caretaker}} manager at Vale, along with Mark Grew, following the departure of Adams. Vale were beaten 5–0 by Rotherham United {{in his first game}} in charge, but rallied to beat Burton Albion 2–1, before Jim Gannon was appointed manager. Gannon retained Horsfield as his assistant. On the way to a match at Aldershot on 25 February, Gannon left the team bus after an apparent bust-up with Horsfield. The national media reported that Gannon granted Horsfield's request for a day off for family reasons but then wrote to the board complaining about his conduct. Having been shown the letter by a director, Horsfield confronted Gannon over the issue. After an internal inquiry, during which Horsfield stayed away from the club, no <b>disciplinary</b> <b>action</b> was taken against either party. Gannon was sacked on 21 March, and Grew was appointed as caretaker-manager with Horsfield as his assistant.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012 it was {{reported}} that police have been given the power to issue £50 on-the-spot fines for littering, cycling outside designated areas and for dog fouling offences. In August 2012 a dog owner was ordered to pay £315 after allowing five dogs to chase ducks in the park. Since 2013 commercial dog-walkers have been required to apply for licences to walk dogs in the park and are allowed to walk only four dogs at a time. In September 2013 a cyclist was successfully prosecuted for speeding at 37mph in the park. In March 2015 a cycling club member was fined for speeding at 41mph and faced <b>disciplinary</b> <b>action</b> from his cycling club, which uses the park for training. In 2014 and 2015 two men were prosecuted for picking mushrooms in the park.|$|E

50|$|Depending on {{the number}} of people {{involved}} and severity of the acts, the state executive or legislature may be compelled to demand that the department be scrutinized and its policies corrected. This can involve replacing individual officers, mid-level leadership, or asking for a resignation by the department chief. <b>Disciplinary</b> <b>actions</b> depend on the severity of the act, but typically result in <b>disciplinary</b> <b>actions</b> by the department and negative media coverage for the department. In 1970, the New York City Knapp Commission began holding officers and supervision accountable and instituting real <b>disciplinary</b> <b>actions</b> for police corruption. In countries where corruption is a major issue, such as China and Russia, state government is often directly involved in investigating and disciplining cases of corruption, such as in the Chongqing gang trials, where police chief Wen Qiang was detained and put on trial for accepting bribes, rape, and other crimes during the Chongqing gang crackdown.|$|R
