50|$|Wedding {{traditions of}} Chinese Filipinos, {{regardless}} of religious persuasion, usually involve {{identification of the}} dates of supplication/pamamanhikan (kiu-hun), engagement (ting-hun), and wedding (kan-chhiu) adopted from Filipino customs, through feng shui based on the birthdates of the couple, {{as well as of}} their parents and grandparents. Certain customs found among Chinese Filipinos include the following: During supplication (kiu-hun), a solemn tea ceremony within the house of the groom ensues where the couple will be served tea, egg noodles (misua), and given ang-paos (red packets containing money). During the supplication ceremony, pregnant women and recently engaged couples are forbidden from attending the ceremony. Engagement (ting-hun) quickly follows, where the bride enters the ceremonial room walking backward and turned three times before being allowed to see the groom. A welcome drink consisting of red-colored juice is given to the couple, quickly followed by the exchange of gifts for both families and the Wedding tea ceremony, where the bride serves the grooms family, and vice versa. The engagement reception consists of sweet tea soup and misua, both of which symbolizes long-lasting relationship. Before the wedding, the groom is expected to provide the matrimonial bed in the future couples new home. A baby born under the Chinese sign of the Dragon may be placed in the bed to ensure fertility. He is also tasked to deliver the wedding gown to his bride on the day prior to the wedding to the sister of the bride, as it is considered ill fortune for the groom to see the bride on that day. For the bride, she prepares an initial batch of personal belongings (ke-chheng) to the new home, all wrapped and labeled with the Chinese characters for sang-hi. On the wedding date, the bride wears a red robe emblazoned with the emblem of a dragon prior to wearing the bridal gown, to which a pair of sang-hi (English: marital happiness) coin is sewn. Before leaving her home, the bride then throws a <b>fan</b> <b>bearing</b> the Chinese characters for sang-hi toward her mother to preserve harmony within the brides family upon her departure. Most of the wedding ceremony then follows Catholic or Protestant traditions. Post-Wedding rituals include the two single brothers or relatives of the bride giving the couple a wa-hoe set, which is a bouquet of flowers with umbrella and sewing kit, for which the bride gives an ang-pao in return. After three days, the couple then visits the brides family, upon which a pair of sugar cane branch is given, which is a symbol of good luck and vitality among Hokkien people.|$|E
40|$|As {{commonly}} used forced convection air cooling devices in electronics, cooling fans are crucial for guaranteeing {{the reliability of}} electronic systems. In a cooling fan assembly, <b>fan</b> <b>bearing</b> failure is a major failure mode that causes excessive vibration, noise, reduction in rotation speed, locked rotor, failure to start, and other problems; therefore, {{it is necessary to}} conduct research on the health assessment of cooling fan bearings. This paper presents a vibration-based <b>fan</b> <b>bearing</b> health evaluation method using comblet filtering and exponentially weighted moving average. A new health condition indicator (HCI) for <b>fan</b> <b>bearing</b> degradation assessment is proposed. In order to collect the vibration data for validation of the proposed method, a cooling fan accelerated life test was conducted to simulate the lubricant starvation of fan bearings. A comparison between the proposed method and methods in previous studies (i. e., root mean square, kurtosis, and fault growth parameter) was carried out to assess the performance of the HCI. The analysis results suggest that the HCI can identify incipient <b>fan</b> <b>bearing</b> failures and describe the bearing degradation process. Overall, the work presented in this paper provides a promising method for <b>fan</b> <b>bearing</b> health evaluation and prognosis...|$|E

40|$|Rolling {{bearings}} are {{key components}} of rotary machines. To ensure early effective fault diagnosis for bearings, a new rolling bearing fault diagnosis method based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and an improved kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) is proposed in this paper. A fault signal is decomposed via VMD to obtain the intrinsic mode function (IMF) components, and the approximate entropy (ApEn) of the IMF component containing the main fault information is calculated. An eigenvector is created from the approximate entropy of each component. A bearing diagnosis model is created via a KELM; the KELM parameters are optimized using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to obtain a KELM diagnosis model with optimal parameters. Finally, {{the effectiveness of the}} diagnosis method proposed in this paper is verified via a <b>fan</b> <b>bearing</b> fault diagnosis test. Under identical conditions, the result is compared with the results obtained using a back propagation (BP) neural network, a conventional extreme learning machine (ELM), and a support vector machine (SVM). The test result shows that the method proposed in this paper is superior to the other three methods in terms of diagnostic accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Self-organizing maps {{have been}} used {{extensively}} for condition-based maintenance, where quantization errors of test data referring to the self-organizing maps of healthy training data {{have been used}} as features. Researchers have used minimum quantization error as a health indicator, which is sensitive to noise in the training data. Some other researchers have used the average of the quantization errors as a health indicator, where the best matching units of the trained self-organizing maps are required to be convex. These requirements are not always satisfied. This paper introduces a method that improves self-organizing maps for anomaly detection by addressing these issues. Noise dominated best matching units extracted from the map trained by the healthy training data are removed, and the rest are used as healthy references. For a given test data observation, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is applied to identify neighbors of the observation that occur in the references. Then the Euclidean distance between the test data observation and the centroid of the neighbors is calculated as a health indicator. Compared with the minimum quantization error, the health indicator extracted by this method is less sensitive to noise, and compared with the average of quantization errors, it does not put limitations on the convexity or distribution of the best matching units. The result was validated using data from experiments on cooling <b>fan</b> <b>bearings.</b> 1...|$|R

The leading bogies and coupled wheels had Cannon-type axle boxes. The cylinders and frames were cast in one piece, while the steel cylinders and steam chests were fitted with cast iron liners. The tender frames of both locomotive types were also one-piece steel water-bottom castings. Since they were entirely mounted on roller bearings, very little effort was required to move these big locomotives.|$|R

50|$|Efficiency of {{automotive}} alternators {{is limited by}} <b>fan</b> cooling loss, <b>bearing</b> loss, iron loss, copper loss, and the voltage drop in the diode bridges. Efficiency reduces dramatically at high speeds mainly due to fan resistance. At medium speeds efficiency of today's alternators is 70-80%. This betters very small high-performance permanent magnet alternators, such as those used for bicycle lighting systems, which achieve an efficiency around 60%. Larger permanent magnet electric machines (that can operate as motors or alternators) can achieve today much higher efficiencies. Pellegrino et al., for instance, propose not particularly expensive designs that show ample regions in which efficiency is above 96%. Large AC generators used in power stations run at carefully controlled speeds and have no constraints on size or weight. They have very high efficiencies as high as 98%.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In [SH 08] we {{introduced}} {{a method for}} the calculation and visualization of the whole TMA solution space. So, not only the best TMA solution, but also other solution areas with high probability can be seen. If by sensor data fusion (SDF) techniques measurements of the same or different type(s), or constraints to kinematic parameters are associated to a target, one expects an improvement in the TMA result. This influence on the TMA solution space can be made visible by the described method and is substantiated by various examples. Finally, we show, that the method is able to visualize the observability, which can be gained {{in the case of}} a missing own manoeuvre by exploiting a target manoeuvre instead. 1 Calculation of the TMA Solution Space Let’s assume, that a sensor, e. g. a Flank Array (FA) on a submarine tracks a target and delivers prefiltered bearings B 1,…,Bn together with their time references t 1,…,tn.

50|$|It {{has since}} been {{established}} that the rocks {{that make up the}} Witwatersrand Ridge dip downwards and southwards to form the largely underground “Witwatersrand Basin” which covers an elliptical area with a 300 km long major axis from Evander in the north-east to Theunissen in the south-west, and 150 km wide stretching from Steynsrus in the south-east to Coligny in the north-west, with a small subsidiary basin at Kinross. Gold occurs only along the northern and western margins of this basin, but not in a continuous band. The gold bearing rocks are limited to 6 sites where Archean rivers from the north and west formed fan deltas, with many braided channels, before flowing into the “Witwatersrand Sea” to the south, where the earlier sediments that form the older rocks of the Witwatersrand Supergroup had been deposited. Some of these gold <b>bearing</b> <b>fan</b> deltas are now at depths of 4 km below the surface.Although many of the older mines, around Johannesburg, are now nearly exhausted, the Witwatersrand Basin still produces most of South Africa's gold and much of the total world output. Silver, uranium, and iridium are recovered as gold-refining by-products.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Bearing is a {{component}} {{that affects the}} performance of a rotating machine in order to be used properly. The purpose of using ball bearing is to reduce rotational friction and support radial and axial loads. Diagnosis of bearing vibration data is an important process to identify either the bearing is normal or defect. In this paper, we consider a single bearing system that consists of one normal or defect <b>Fan</b> End (FE) <b>bearing</b> in which an accelerometer is attached to both normal and defect FE bearing to capture the vibration data. These vibration data are grouped into several samples data. Five parameters are extracted from each sample to be used as the input in neural network model and class of target output is either normal or defect. Those five parameters are standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, absolute mean and root mean square. Our objectives are to find the dominant parameters and the best model for fault diagnosis of single bearing system. It is important to find the dominant parameters since the selection of dominant parameter can reduce the pre-processing data phase. According to our observation that the dominant parameter is either of standard deviation, absolute mean or root mean square and the best BPNN model is the model with one input neuron and one neuron in hidden layer...|$|R
40|$|NASA s {{plans for}} Extravehicular Activity (EVA) {{portable}} {{life support systems}} for future exploration missions result in different design requirements than those {{which led to the}} combined fan / pump / separator in the current ISS Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). To meet these new requirements, NASA contracted with Hamilton Sundstrand to provide two new prototype fans designed to meet anticipated future system requirements. Based on design trade studies, a high speed <b>fan</b> with mechanical <b>bearing</b> support of the rotating elements and a novel non-metallic barrier canned motor design was developed and implemented in the deliverable prototypes. The prototypes, which used two different bearing lubricants, have been extensively tested in both stand-alone and integrated system tests in NASA laboratories and proven to meet the anticipated performance requirements. Subsequently, they have been subjected to post test inspection and analysis in Hamilton Sundstrand laboratories to assess the effects of integrated operation and resultant exposure to vent loop contaminants. Results have confirmed expectations that one of the lubricants would be superior in this application and the prototype fans have been reassembled with new bearings with the superior lubricant. They have now been returned to the Johnson Space Center for further testing and maturation as part of NASA s PLSS 2. 0 integrated test effort. This paper will discuss the test history of these units, resulting test data, the results of post test evaluation, and plans for further testing in the near future...|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: Australia’s {{coal fired}} power {{stations}} {{are the most}} efficient form of providing bulk base load power generation (i. e. electricity) to consumers. This is due to Australia having an abundance of thermal coal reserves, which is the fuel used in coal fired power stations. Therefore it is extremely important that these power stations operate at maximum availability and reliability to ensure the consumer receives cost effective and uninterrupted electricity. Callide C Power Station in Biloela Queensland is a 900 Megawatt (MW) coal fired power station that was commissioned in 2001. Unfortunately Callide C Power Station has been plagued with continuous operational and reliability problems caused from the induced draft (ID) fans since initial commissioning. The ID fan problems have arisen from the bearing lubrication system which provides oil recirculation to the induction motor <b>bearings</b> and <b>fan</b> main shaft <b>bearings.</b> Consequently these issues have caused half-load unit (225 MW) run-backs and full unit (450 MW) trips over the past decade. This project’s aim is to analyse the ID fan lubrication system and then identify and define all root causes and their associated failure modes. Once all root causes are identified through Root Cause Analysis (RCA) process, effective design solutions can be researched and evaluated so a proposed modification design project can be finalised. This final design proposal {{will be used to}} justify capital expenditure so implementation can occur in the near future...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{aerodynamic}} noise generated by centrifugal fans is receiving increasing attention because of strict environmental noise level restrictions and customer demands. The noise generated by fans {{is due to}} aerodynamic sources and to other several sources, such as, for instance, by the <b>fan</b> drive, by <b>bearings</b> and gearing, and, when present, by the inverter. Additional noise sources can be also due to structural resonance effects induced by periodic forces associated with the blade passing frequency or vortex shedding. Usually, these additional noise sources are dominated by {{aerodynamic noise}} generated by the fan, in particular when the intake and outlet of the fan are free. On the other side, if fan intake and outlet are ducted, the additional sources can relevantly contribute to overall sound generation. In this paper, an experimental characterization of the noise generated by industrial centrifugal fans when both inlet and outlet are ducted is presented.. To do this, an experimental facility has been design and set up, and the sound power measured {{by means of the}} procedures outlined in the ISO 3746 international standard. A number of different type of centrifugal fan (straight-, forward- and backward blade) in different working conditions were tested, resulting in 133 different runs. These amount of data were then processed and a general formula for fan noise estimation obtained {{as a function of the}} geometrical and fluid dynamic parameters is derived. Moreover, specific coefficients with respect to blade geometry for the determination of the A-weighted frequency spectrum are presented. Finally, auxiliary devices or other features, such as inverter, thickness of the casing, acoustic insulation, electric motor shaft, are analyzed and some general rules to estimate their influence on sound power level quantified...|$|R
