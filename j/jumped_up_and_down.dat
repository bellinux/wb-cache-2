5|$|In the end, Sounders FC {{was able}} to {{withstand}} D.C.'s late push for a 2–1 victory, becoming the second MLS expansion team in league history (Chicago Fire was the first) to win the U.S. Open Cup in their inaugural season. Players and coaches ran onto the field after the final whistle, <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> together and hurried to {{a corner of the}} field to acknowledge the Sounders FC fans cheering in the upper deck.|$|E
25|$|Another craze that City {{supporters}} {{decided to}} implement in England {{is a celebration}} or dance that has been given the nickname of 'The Poznan'. It first started on 21 October 2010 {{in a game against}} Lech Poznań in the Europa League, during the game the whole of the Poznan end turned their back to the pitch, joined arms and <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> in unison.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} during the promotional tour for the Hard Candy album, and the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour; both performances were similar. In the promotional tour, [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] was performed as the fifth {{song of the}} setlist. Madonna wore a shiny black dress with black tails, Adidas track pants and high-heeled, lace-up boots. Every time the chorus played, Madonna and her back-up dancers <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> while waving their hands up in the air. The performance was backed by laser lights {{in the background and}} two movable screens, which displayed Williams, performing his lines.|$|E

500|$|The {{sequence}} {{then moved}} on to celebrate British children's literature. J. K. Rowling began by reading from J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan (whose copyright was given to Great Ormond Street Hospital). The Child Catcher appeared amongst the children, followed by giant puppet representations of villains from British children's literature: the Queen of Hearts, Captain Hook, Cruella de Vil and Lord Voldemort. [...] Minutes later, 32 women playing Mary Poppins descended on flying umbrellas, as the villains deflated and the actors resumed dancing. The music for this sequence included partially rearranged sections from Tubular Bells (with a giant set of tubular bells {{at the rear of the}} stage), Tubular Bells III and, after the villains had been driven away by the Mary Poppins characters, In Dulci Jubilo. [...] During this performance the children in pyjamas <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> on their brightly lit beds, creating a memorable image amid the darkness of the stadium.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} added to the 2009 leg of her Sticky & Sweet Tour. It {{replaced}} the song [...] "Heartbeat" [...] from Hard Candy and was used as a tribute to singer Michael Jackson who died a week {{prior to the start of}} the second leg of the tour. As Madonna sang the song, a picture of a young Jackson appeared on stage, followed by a Jackson impersonator wearing garments in Jackson style. The music then switched to a medley of his songs, like [...] "Billie Jean" [...] and [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'", and the impersonator worked through his moves, including the moonwalk as well as the spinning and gyrating. Madonna clapped her hands, swayed from side to side and <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> while images of Jackson over the years flashed on a big screen. After the performance, Madonna told the crowd, [...] "Let's give it up for one of the greatest artists the world has ever known," [...] and the crowd applauded.|$|E
2500|$|Yorke had {{recorded}} an early demo of [...] "The National Anthem" [...] when {{the band was}} still in school. In 1997, Radiohead recorded drums and bass for the song, intending to develop it for an OK Computer B-side, but decided to save it for their next album. For Kid A, Greenwood added ondes Martenot and sampled sounds from radio stations, and Yorke's vocals were processed with a ring modulator. In November 1999, Radiohead recorded a brass section inspired by the [...] "organised chaos" [...] of Town Hall Concert by the jazz musician Charles Mingus. Yorke and Greenwood directed the musicians {{to sound like a}} [...] "traffic jam"; according to Yorke, he <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> so much during his conducting that he broke his foot. Radiohead also worked on several songs that were not completed until recording sessions for future albums, including [...] "I Will" [...] and [...] "A Wolf at the Door" [...] (released on Hail to the Thief), [...] "Nude" [...] (In Rainbows), [...] "Burn the Witch", and [...] "True Love Waits" [...] (A Moon Shaped Pool).|$|E

60|$|I {{can well}} {{remember}} {{the explosion of}} human joy which marked the sudden starting of that train; all the factory girls who could not find seats (and {{they must have been}} the majority) relieving their feelings by <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> Now I have never seen any rationalistic idealists do this. I have never seen twenty modern philosophers crowd into one third-class carriage for the mere pleasure of being together. I have never seen twenty Mr. McCabes all in one carriage <b>and</b> all <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R

60|$|But Betty, {{ignoring}} these, <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> {{before the}} dingy clock, demanding further trumpetings, and, turning to Mrs. Oakley, as one possessing influence, {{she was aware}} of a curious, intent look in the old lady's eyes.|$|E

60|$|Still no one {{moved to}} obey him. From white {{he went to}} red, {{and then back to}} white again. He fairly frothed at the mouth as he <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> cursing the men, and threatening. But all to no avail. They would not go.|$|E
60|$|The lad {{came out}} of his trance and looked back at his companions, who edged nearer. Jones ate a lump of sugar, then handed one to the little Indian. He took it gingerly, put it into his mouth and {{immediately}} <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E

60|$|The Nome was so {{furious at}} this refusal that he <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> with rage and spluttered and choked {{for a long}} time before he could control his passion.

30|$|We analyze {{solutions}} using fast-slow analysis. The {{basic idea}} is that the solutionevolves on two different time scales: During the <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> thesolution evolves on a fast time scale, while during the silent and activephases, the solution evolves on a slow time scale. The fast-slow analysis allows usto derive reduced equations that determine the evolution of the solution during eachof these phases. In particular, we derive explicit formulas for the times when eachcell <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> use these to determine the outcomes of the races tothreshold, depending on parameters and initial conditions. To derive these formulas,we will make some simplifying assumptions on the equations; in situations in whichsuch formulas cannot be obtained, then a similar analysis can be donenumerically.|$|R
50|$|To {{coincide}} {{with the release of}} the Scum DualDisc in March 2007, a music video produced by Earache Records was released for the song. The video shows a crying girl <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then {{he put a}} tight {{compress}} on {{my upper}} arm, stopped my pulse with his fingers, and squeezed a rubber bulb connected with an apparatus on a stand {{that looked like a}} thermometer.

60|$|Rabba Kega, {{seeing that}} he had the {{attention}} of Mbonga, Ibeto, and Momaya, blew suddenly into the vessel, with the result that the leaves commenced to smolder, and smoke issued {{from the mouth of the}} receptacle. Rabba Kega was careful to hold it so that none might see the dry leaves. Their eyes opened wide at this remarkable demonstration of the village witch-doctor's powers. The latter, greatly elated, let himself out. He shouted, <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> and made frightful grimaces; then he put his face close over the mouth of the vessel and appeared to be communing with the spirits within.|$|E
6000|$|Tommy {{arranged}} {{with her that}} she should always be on the outlook {{for him at the}} window, and he would come sometimes, and after that they met frequently, and she proved a credit to him, gurgling with mirth at his tales of Thrums, and pinching him when he had finished, {{to make sure that he}} was really made just like common human beings. He was a thin, pale boy, while she looked like a baby rose full blown in a night because her time was short; and his movements were sluggish, but if she was not walking she must be dancing, and sometimes when there were few people in the street, the little armful of delight that she was <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> like a ball, while Tommy kept the time, singing [...] "Thrummy, Thrummy, Thrum Thrum Thrummy."
