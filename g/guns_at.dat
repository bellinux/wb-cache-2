5|$|The heavy Ottoman fire forced Canopus and Swiftsure to {{withdraw}} from their bombardment position, though this placed them in range of the <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> Erenköy as well, while those at Dardanus could still engage them. Cornwallis, having silenced the <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> Intepe, started shelling Erenköy, while Canopus and Swiftsure kept their fire on Dardanus. The Ottomans repeatedly straddled the three battleships, but being further out in the strait, they had more room to manoeuvre and so avoided any direct hits. By 16:40, the <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> Dardanus fell silent, allowing all three ships to concentrate their fire at Erenköy, where the batteries were quickly neutralised. The three ships then withdrew, seemingly having achieved their objective, though that night, when destroyers and minesweepers tried to clear the minefields blocking the straits, they were met with very heavy fire and were forced {{to withdraw}}.

5|$|In spiking the <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> the Red House battery, the Americans had {{accomplished}} {{the more important}} of their two objectives: an invading force could now land between Chippawa and Fort Erie without facing artillery fire. However, subsequent events would render their service useless.|$|E

5|$|The {{quality of}} guns, armor, ordnance, and design was {{changing}} rapidly, so experience could quickly become irrelevant. Combat {{experience in the}} Spanish–American War had shown the value of many smaller <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> close range, where the larger guns had been inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|At 03:00, the 8th Heavy Company, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment with 75mm SP guns, 20mm AA guns, and mortars {{attacked}} 'A' and 'C' Companies, 7th Parachute Battalion, {{from the}} south. The paratroops were forced {{back and the}} Germans established their own positions in Bénouville, but were unable to break the British line. They dug in and waited for tank support before moving forward again. The Germans fired mortar bombs and machine <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> the paratroopers and attempted small assaults on their positions throughout the night.|$|E
5|$|At 05:30 on 22 May, the Anglo-Egyptian advance continued, but {{the nature}} of the country, which {{consisted}} mainly of rolling low level sand-hills, with plenty of concealed ground and scattered bushes, reduced visibility down to just a few hundred yards. From the start, large groups of Fur camaliers and cavalry were observed. So instead of sending out his scouts Kelly formed an advance guard of the mounted infantry, a camel company and four Maxim machine <b>guns.</b> <b>At</b> 10:30, the Fur troops were observed in a strong entrenched position around the village of Beringia.|$|E

5|$|At {{about six}} {{o'clock in the}} morning, some of the protesters {{discovered}} a small gate to the palace was unguarded. Making their way inside, they searched for the queen's bedchamber. The royal guards raced throughout the palace, bolting doors and barricading hallways {{and those in the}} compromised sector, the cour de marbre, fired their <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> the intruders, killing a young member of the crowd. Infuriated, the rest surged towards the breach and streamed inside.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s, the castle's defences {{had become}} {{obsolete}} once again {{due to the}} development of torpedo boats and superior breech-loading guns. In response, five 6-pounder quick-firing guns and searchlights were installed to deal with the torpedo boat threat and, between 1899 and 1901, the east battery was converted to hold breech-loading <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> a cost of £16,670.|$|E
5|$|Gunports {{for early}} {{gunpowder}} artillery {{had begun to}} be installed in English castles during the 15th century. At Kirby Muxloe, six gunports were constructed in the ground floor walls of both the gatehouse and west tower; these were then temporarily filled with bricks, probably to prevent vermin and to limit the drafts. Several more gunports were built lower down in the gatehouse, presumably in error as they were ultimately below the waterline of the moat and permanently blocked up. The range of any <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> the castle would have been quite limited, as they were positioned relatively low to the ground. Historians are uncertain to what extent any <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> Kirby Muxloe would have been useful in a conflict. The gunports are of early design {{and may have been}} intended to be symbolic rather than practical; they were well positioned across the castle's defences, however, and might well have been intended to deter a serious attack.|$|E

5|$|In 1593 {{there was}} a fresh crisis with Spain and the brass guns needed for the English navy were in short supply. Brass {{artillery}} pieces were therefore rounded up from the forts along the south coast, including Camber. The number of <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> the castle remained around the same, but the larger, brass culverins and demi-cannon were removed, being replaced with smaller iron demi-culverins, sakers and a minion. In 1594 another royal survey suggested that £95 of repair work was needed on the fortifications.|$|E
5|$|In case of B license {{the person}} is allowed to use their <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> {{shooting}} ranges. The C license is required by other laws for hunting.

5|$|James IV {{brought in}} experts from France, Germany and the Netherlands and {{established}} a gun foundry in 1511. Edinburgh Castle had a house of artillery where visitors could see cannon cast for what became a formidable train, allowing him to send cannon to France and Ireland and to quickly subdue Norham Castle in the Flodden campaign. However, his 18 heavy artillery pieces had to be drawn by 400 oxen and slowed the advancing Scots army, proving ineffective against the longer-range and smaller-calibre English <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Flodden Field.|$|E
5|$|Many of Gibraltar's fortifications {{were already}} {{redundant}} {{well before the}} British garrison was withdrawn from the territory in the 1990s, and the rapid military rundown in the 1980s and the 1990s left the civilian authorities with {{a large amount of}} surplus military property. Many of the best-preserved fortifications are in the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, a conservation area that covers about 40% of the area of Gibraltar. A few of the Upper Rock batteries have been preserved intact; all three of the 5.25-inch <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> Princess Anne's Battery are still in place, making it {{the only place in the}} world where a complete 5.25-inch battery can still be seen. The 9.2 inch <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> Breakneck, Lord Airey's and O'Hara's Batteries are still in situ and can now be visited. Elsewhere, most of the ordnance has been removed. Two surviving 6-inch guns remain at Devil's Gap Battery, one of which is the gun that engaged a German U-boat in August 1917. At Napier of Magdala Battery one of the two 100-ton RML 17.72 inch guns is still in situ and has been restored, along with a 3.7 inch quick-firing anti-aircraft gun. The site is now run by the Gibraltar Tourist Board in conjunction with the Nature Reserve.|$|E
5|$|On 28 November—after 23 October 1983 Beirut barracks bombing—the U.S. {{government}} announced that New Jersey would be retained off Beirut although her crew would be rotated.

5|$|On 31 May, Conqueror, {{under the}} command of Captain Hugh Tothill, was the seventh ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. The ship may have had engine {{problems}} during the battle because she was having trouble maintaining 20 knots as a signal from Jellicoe at 17:17 instructed Thunderer to overtake Conqueror if she could not maintain speed. During the first stage of the general engagement, the ship fired three salvos from her main <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> one battleship at 18:31 without visible effect. She then shifted her fire to the crippled light cruiser , although the number of hits made, if any, is unknown. At 19:12, Conqueror fired her main <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> enemy destroyers without result and then again, at different destroyers at 19:25 with her aft turrets. This was the last time that the ship fired her guns during the battle, having expended a total of 57 twelve-inch shells (41 common pointed, capped and 16 armour-piercing, capped).|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{response of the}} British was a two-hour cannon barrage at the heights, which had no effect because the British guns could not reach the American <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> such height. After {{the failure of the}} barrage, Howe and his officers agreed that the colonists must be removed from the heights if they were to hold Boston. They planned an assault on the heights; however, due to a storm the attack never took place, and the British elected instead to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|The {{only time}} Yamato fired her main <b>guns</b> <b>at</b> enemy surface targets was in October 1944, {{when she was}} sent to engage American forces invading the Philippines during the Battle of Leyte Gulf.
