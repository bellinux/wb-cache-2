5|$|Kinslow {{was known}} to have a <b>genial,</b> sunny disposition, and was quick to make friends. In the 1900 United States Census, he living {{with his father and}} working as an oyster dealer. He is listed as being married for ten years, but his wife was not living in the same home. He died in his {{hometown}} of Washington, D.C. after a year-long battle with consumption (tuberculosis), and is interred at Congressional Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Dave Lister, {{played by}} Craig Charles, is a <b>genial</b> Liverpudlian and {{self-described}} bum. He was the lowest-ranking of the 169 crew {{members on the}} ship before the accident. He has a long-standing desire to return to Earth and start a farm and/or diner on Fiji (which is under three feet of water following a volcanic eruption), but is left impossibly far away by the accident, which renders him the last (known) surviving member of the human race. He likes Indian food, especially chicken vindaloo, which is a recurring theme in the series.|$|E
5|$|He was {{a member}} of the Washington Light Infantry, a local Washington, D.C. militia, and played in many of their amateur {{baseball}} games throughout his life. When not playing, he tended to his bar. Noted for being a <b>genial,</b> friendly individual, he was quick to make friends, and was a fan-favorite in his hometown of Washington, D.C. Kinslow was a heavy drinker however, which caused him to miss games and team movements on occasion. Late into his career, these alcohol issues were much less tolerated, eventually hastening his exit from the game. He died at the age of 35, after a year-long battle with tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Three short {{plays by}} Shaw were premiered during the war. The Inca of Perusalem, written in 1915, {{encountered}} {{problems with the}} censor for burlesquing not only the enemy but the British military command; it was performed in 1916 at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. O'Flaherty V.C., satirising the government's attitude to Irish recruits, was banned in the UK and was presented at a Royal Flying Corps base in Belgium in 1917. Augustus Does His Bit, a <b>genial</b> farce, was granted a licence; it opened at the Royal Court in January 1917.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{importance}} of his title, Thơ rarely appeared with Diệm in public and was a figurehead with little influence. The real power lay with Diệm's younger brothers, Nhu and Cẩn, who commanded private armies and secret police, as well as giving orders directly to ARVN generals. Nhu reportedly once ordered a bodyguard to slap Thơ because he felt Thơ had shown him a lack of respect. Diệm held Thơ in contempt and did not allow him {{to take part in}} major policy decisions, despite theoretically being the second most powerful man in the country. Thơ had a rapport with the military officers, having befriended Minh years earlier. He was regarded as a <b>genial</b> and affable administrator with a reputation for making compromises.|$|E
5|$|In 1860, Edward {{undertook}} {{the first}} tour of North America by a Prince of Wales. His <b>genial</b> good humour and confident bonhomie made the tour a great success. He inaugurated the Victoria Bridge, Montreal, across the St Lawrence River, {{and laid the}} cornerstone of Parliament Hill, Ottawa. He watched Charles Blondin traverse Niagara Falls by highwire, and stayed for three days with President James Buchanan at the White House. Buchanan accompanied the Prince to Mount Vernon, to pay his respects at the tomb of George Washington. Vast crowds greeted him everywhere. He met Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes. Prayers for the royal family were said in Trinity Church, New York, {{for the first time}} since 1776. The four-month tour throughout Canada and the United States considerably boosted Edward's confidence and self-esteem, and had many diplomatic benefits for Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Botha {{suffered}} a stroke; although he would retain the state presidency, {{he stepped down}} {{as leader of the}} National Party, to be replaced by F. W. de Klerk. In a surprise move, Botha invited Mandela to a meeting over tea in July 1989, an invitation Mandela considered <b>genial.</b> Botha was replaced as state president by de Klerk six weeks later; the new president believed that apartheid was unsustainable and released a number of ANC prisoners. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, de Klerk called his cabinet together to debate legalising the ANC and freeing Mandela. Although some were deeply opposed to his plans, de Klerk met with Mandela in December to discuss the situation, a meeting both men considered friendly, before legalising all formerly banned political parties in February 1990 and announcing Mandela's unconditional release. Shortly thereafter, {{for the first time in}} 20 years, photographs of Mandela were allowed to be published in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Julian Carlton was a 31-year-old man {{who came}} {{to work as a}} chef and servant at Taliesin for the summer. Carlton was an Afro-Caribbean of West Indian descent, ostensibly from Barbados. He was {{recommended}} to Wright by John Vogelsong, Jr., the caterer for the Midway Gardens project. Carlton and his wife Gertrude had previously served in the house of Vogelsong's parents in Chicago. Originally a <b>genial</b> presence on the estate, Carlton grew increasingly paranoid. He stayed up late at night with a butcher knife, looking out the window. This behavior had been noticed by Wright and Borthwick, who issued an ad in a local paper for a replacement cook. Carlton was given notice that August 15, 1914 would be his last day in their employ.|$|E
25|$|The <b>genial</b> Foster {{was also}} an {{excellent}} table tennis player, and at one time was West Indies champion. He is the brother of West Indian table tennis champions Joy Foster and the late Dave Foster.|$|E
25|$|In private life, Dent possessed {{qualities of}} mind and heart, having their visible outcome in a courteous, <b>genial</b> manner that endeared him very closely to his friends. With all his wealth of learning, which was very great, he was light-hearted, witty and companionable.|$|E
25|$|Rizal, {{through his}} reading of Morga {{and other western}} historians, knew of the <b>genial</b> image of Spain's early {{relations}} with his people. In his writings, he showed the disparity between the early colonialists and those of his day, with the latter's injustices giving rise to Gomburza and the Philippine Revolution of 1896.|$|E
25|$|The {{apparently}} <b>genial</b> Moríñigo quickly {{proved himself}} a shrewd politician with {{a mind of}} his own, and Liberal ministers resigned on September 30, when they realized {{that they could not}} impose their will on him. Having inherited Estigarribia's near-dictatorial powers provided by the new 1940 Constitution, Moríñigo quickly banned febreristas and Liberals and clamped down drastically on free speech and individual liberties.|$|E
25|$|Lyons {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{genuinely}} popular men to hold the office of prime minister, and his death caused widespread grief. His <b>genial,</b> laid-back appearance often led to cartoon portrayal as a sleepy koala. A devout Catholic, he was the second Catholic to become prime minister, after his immediate predecessor Scullin, and the only non-Labor Catholic prime minister until Tony Abbott.|$|E
25|$|His contemporaries {{considered}} Clayton one of {{the most}} skilled debaters and orators in the Senate. He was always accessible, and was noted for his <b>genial</b> disposition and brilliant conversational powers. Clayton Hall at the University of Delaware is named in his honor, as are towns in Delaware, New York, North Carolina and a county in Iowa. In 1934, the state of Delaware donated a statue of Clayton to the National Statuary Hall Collection.|$|E
25|$|For his own {{experiments}} on vision, Rivers worked {{with two of}} his graduate medical students, Charles S. Myers and William McDougall who assisted him at this period in a series of {{experiments on}} vision and with whom he formed close friendships. Rivers also collaborated with the pioneer instrument maker Sir Horace Darwin in the improvement of apparatus for recording sensations, especially those involved in vision. This collaboration was the basis of a lifelong friendship between Rivers and the <b>genial</b> son of Charles Darwin.|$|E
25|$|In April 1901 Lee {{was elected}} as the {{compromise}} {{leader of the}} new Liberal Reform Party of New South Wales, which had emerged from the former Free Trade Party, and consequently the first official Leader of the Opposition, after {{the withdrawal of the}} favoured candidate Joseph Carruthers. Lee's party was divided and unprepared for the elections ten weeks later, at which they were defeated. Although respected as an MP, Lee's <b>genial</b> and quiet manner proved highly unsuited for leadership and he eventually resigned on 17 September 1902 in favour of Carruthers.|$|E
25|$|A heavily built man, Burge was a combative {{player who}} was {{regarded}} as quiet and <b>genial</b> off the field. An attacking player, he {{was known for his}} penchant for the hook shot and his ability against fast bowling. Burge {{is one of the few}} cricketers to be given out handled the ball. In a Shield match against New South Wales in 195859, the ball struck him on the pad and went up in the air. Unconsciously, he put up a hand and the ball landed in his palm.|$|E
25|$|The {{trouble with}} our <b>genial</b> humorist {{is that he}} is beyond his depth. He would not make a success if he turned statesman. He would not make much of a success if he turned missionary; as a humorist he is incomparable. Every man to his trade. Let Mark {{remember}} this, and let him choose as a target for his satire something other than the heroic men who have been through the nightmare of blood and ruin in China, while he has been comfortably basking in the sunlight that makes eternal summer for a genius admired of both old world and new.|$|E
25|$|The <b>genial,</b> undemanding Da was {{the polar}} {{opposite}} of Charlie's other father figure, Drumm, a high-level civil servant. Since Drumm {{was one of}} the few prosperous, educated Irishmen in the vicinity, Charlie's parents hoped he could find Charlie a job. In 1945, they invited Drumm to their home to introduce him to 17-year-old Charlie. The introduction went disastrously, as Da made a series of foolish, embarrassing statements (Da believed that a German victory in World War II was imminent, and he was plainly rooting for this outcome). Charlie was humiliated, and was astonished to learn that, despite everything, Drumm had actually taken a liking to him.|$|E
25|$|His {{literary}} {{career began}} in 1842 {{with the publication}} of an essay, in Russian, on Dilettantism in Science, under the pseudonym of Iskander, the Turkish form of his Christian name. His second work, also in Russian, was his Letters on the Study of Nature (1845–46). In 1847 appeared his novel Who is to blame? This is a story about how the domestic happiness of a young tutor, who marries the unacknowledged daughter of a Russian sensualist of the old type, dull, ignorant and <b>genial,</b> is troubled by a Russian sensualist of the new school, intelligent, accomplished, and callous, with there being no possibility of saying who is most to blame for the tragic ending.|$|E
25|$|Hosts such as Jack Narz and Hal March {{continued}} to work on television after the scandals. March died in January 1970 from lung cancer. Narz, who passed a lie-detector test {{at the time of}} the Dotto affair, had an extensive career as a game show host after the incident (as did his brother Tom Kennedy), retiring in 1982; he died in October 2008 after suffering two massive strokes. Sonny Fox, the original host of The $64,000 Challenge, left that show long before it could become tainted and became a popular children's host in the northeast, remembered best as the suave, <b>genial</b> host of the Sunday morning learn-and-laugh marathon Wonderama. Fox's replacement, Ralph Story, went on to become a newscaster for KNXT-TV/KCBS-TV in Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|Lee's {{new start}} was {{initially}} impeded by a broken leg, suffered while playing football, {{but he soon}} established himself in the team in the 1954 season and was awarded his cap in the 1956 season. A canny right-hander, he made 1,000 runs for eight successive seasons, nudging {{the ball into the}} gaps without often dominating the bowling. He cut loose in the occasional run chase, hitting five sixes off Jim McConnon at Swansea in the 1958 season and five more at Lord's in the 1961 season. In the 1963 season, he became county captain but, with their fast bowler Les Jackson in decline, he had little ammunition to work with. Derbyshire took the wooden spoon in his first season at the helm, but recovered to 12th in the 1964 season under his <b>genial</b> leadership before he decided to return to teaching.|$|E
25|$|Chola rulers took {{an active}} {{interest}} {{in the development of}} temple centres and used the temples to widen the sphere of their royal authority. They established educational institutions and hospitals around the temple, enhanced the beneficial aspects {{of the role of the}} temple, and projected the royalty as a very powerful and <b>genial</b> presence. A record of Virarajendra Chola's reign relates to the maintenance of a school in the Jananamandapa within the temple for the study of the Vedas, Sastras, Grammar, and Rupavatara, as well as a hostel for students. The students were provided with food, bathing oil on Saturdays, and oil for pups. A hospital named Virasolan was provided with fifteen beds for sick people. The items of expense set apart for their comforts are rice, a doctor, a surgeon, two maid servants for nursing the patients, and a general servant for the hospital.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, King Khalid {{was not an}} {{effective}} leader. Although {{he seemed to be}} reluctant to rule the country initially, he later warmed to the throne and displayed an apparent interest in improving the education, health-care and infrastructure of the country during his seven-year reign. King Khalid is also considered to have been a <b>genial</b> caretaker during his reign. However, King Khalid failed to monopolize the power during his reign, leading to the empowerment of the princes who had been in powerful posts in late King Faisal's reign. He had some personal characteristics that made him a respected king. Although he did not have an active interest in affairs of state and his health was not good, he was admired as an honest man who managed to have good relations with the traditional establishment of Saudi Arabia. Therefore, he was granted support by other princes and powerful forces of the country.|$|E
25|$|After the {{fireworks}} of the First Test the MCC team drove to Toowoomba with their reputation much enhanced by their performance and were welcomed as heroes. Rugby League was strong in Queensland's largest inland {{town and the}} <b>genial</b> John Bapty, who covered both rugby and cricket in the Yorkshire Evening Post, gave a speech of thanks after a dinner was given for the Lancastrians and Yorkshiremen in the team. The MCC belted 428/6 off 54.5 overs against light-hearted bowling with David Sheppard (72), Reg Simpson (98), Gilbert Parkhouse (57), acting captain Denis Compton (92) and wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans (94) helping themselves, but Brian Close going for a duck. Compton declared {{in the afternoon and}} the Queensland Country XI were 88/3 by stumps and 220 all out the next day with captain Tom Allen hitting 2 sixes and 10 fours in his top-scoring 83 as Doug Wright (5/52) and Eric Hollies (3/33) served up old-fashioned leg-spin. Rather that enforce the follow on and going for a win Compton good-naturedly put on another batting display and the MCC hit 297/7 off the remaining 37 overs of the day. Sheppard made 42, Parkhouse 58 and even the stonewaller Trevor Bailey gave the bowling the long handle with 68 not out, but Close bagged a pair.|$|E

500|$|The book {{centers on}} Horton, a <b>genial</b> elephant, who is {{convinced}} by Mayzie, a lazy, irresponsible bird, {{to sit on}} her egg while she takes a short [...] "break", which turns into her permanent relocation to Palm Beach.|$|E
500|$|The short plays {{range from}} <b>genial</b> {{historical}} drama in The Dark Lady of the Sonnets and Great Catherine (1910 and 1913) {{to a study}} of polygamy in Overruled; three satirical works about the war (The Inca of Perusalem, O'Flaherty V.C. and Augustus Does His Bit, 1915–16); a piece that Shaw called [...] "utter nonsense" [...] (The Music Cure, 1914) and a brief sketch about a [...] "Bolshevik empress" [...] (Annajanska, 1917).|$|E
500|$|McGregor was a {{committed}} Christian who was widely respected for his honesty and integrity. He worshipped {{for forty years}} at the Congregational church in Wheeler Street, Aston. His pastor, the Revd. W.G. Percival said {{that the best thing}} about him [...] "was not so much the <b>genial,</b> kindly, honest sportsman, but the Christian behind it all". He described him as [...] "a man of absolutely unblemished personal character".|$|E
500|$|Tillypronie is a Victorian era house between Ballater and Strathdon in Scotland, {{just east}} of the Cairngorms National Park, {{overlooking}} the valley of the River Dee; the gardens are open to the public. Lady Clark collected thousands of recipes for her own use between 1841 and 1897; among her house-guests in the 1870s was Henry James, who commented in a letter [...] "I bless the old house on the mountain and its <b>genial</b> and bountiful tenants".|$|E
500|$|... {{a living}} coincidentia oppositorum; half giant, yet wholly a [...] "lovely" [...] knight"; {{as full of}} demoniac energy as old Karamazov, yet in his own house, as jolly as a Dickensian Christmas host; now exhibiting a ferocity so gleeful that it is almost <b>genial,</b> and now a geniality so {{outrageous}} that it borders on the ferocious; half boy or buffoon in his shouts and laughter and jumpings; yet at the end judging Gawain with the tranquil superiority of an angelic being ...|$|E
500|$|Berger {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "blustery", cynical, and [...] "one of Himmler's most competent and ruthless war-time lieutenants". An ardent anti-Semite, he was also a proponent of the Final Solution. The historian Gerhard Rempel described him as a skilled bureaucratic manipulator, who was [...] "unscrupulous, blunt, and inelegant in manner and expression, yet also full of <b>genial</b> loquacity and racy humour". Despite his own unassailable position {{at the head of the}} SS, Himmler was often distracted by Berger's gossip and subterfuge against other leaders within the SS.|$|E
500|$|Margalit Fox, writing Newby's {{obituary}} in the New York Times, {{notes that}} the trip {{was the one that}} made him famous, and states that [...] "As in all his work, the narrative was marked by <b>genial</b> self-effacement and overwhelming understatement." [...] She cites a 1959 review in the same publication by William O. Douglas, later a Supreme Court judge, who called the book [...] "a chatty, humorous and perceptive account", adding that [...] "Even the unsanitary hotel accommodations, the infected drinking water, the unpalatable food, the inevitable dysentery are lively, amusing, laughable episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|Goebel {{was never}} {{known as a}} {{particularly}} <b>genial</b> person in public. He belonged to few social organizations, and greeted none but his closest friends with a smile or handshake. [...] He was rarely linked romantically with a woman, {{and is the only}} governor of Kentucky who never married. His physical features bespoke his taciturn nature. Journalist Irvin S. Cobb remarked that Goebel's appearance was [...] "reptilian", while others commented on his contemptuous lips, sharp nose, and humorless eyes. Neither was Goebel a gifted public speaker, eschewing flowery imagery and relying on his deep, powerful voice and forceful delivery to drive home his points.|$|E
500|$|Regarding his own personality, Duncan compares {{himself to}} Will Hunting {{of the movie}} Good Will Hunting, which centers on the <b>genial</b> and {{antagonistic}} character of Will Hunting, portrayed by Matt Damon. He stated: [...] "I'm just a taller, slightly less hyperactive version of the Damon character in the movie. I really enjoyed how he probed people and found out their weaknesses just by asking questions and stating outlandish remarks." [...] He also admitted shunning the limelight because [...] " [...] is not me." [...] Off the court, he has stated that his best friend is former Spurs colleague Antonio Daniels, who describes Duncan as a cheerful, funny person off the hardwood.|$|E
