5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{prerogative}} is in much {{use in the}} realm of foreign affairs. It is the monarch who recognises foreign states (although several statutes regulate the immunities enjoyed by their heads and diplomatic representatives), issues declarations of war and peace, and forms international treaties. The monarch also has the power to annexe territory, as was done in 1955 with the island of Rockall. Once territory has been annexed, the monarch has complete discretion as {{to the extent to which}} the government will take over the former government's liabilities; this was confirmed in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v The King. The monarch also has the power to alter British territorial waters and cede territory. Her freedom to <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> in practice is doubtful, in that they might deprive British citizens of their nationality and rights. When the island of Heligoland was ceded to Germany in 1890, Parliamentary approval was first sought. The monarch can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through Orders in Council. The courts have long fought against the monarch's use of this power: in R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No 2), the Court of Appeal ruled that using Orders-in-Council to frustrate judicial rulings was an unlawful abuse of power, although this ruling was later overturned.|$|E

25|$|If {{the wife}} dies, {{even if not}} due to illness, the Talmud's stipulations require the husband to arrange, and pay for, her burial; the burial must, {{in the opinion of}} the Talmud, be one {{conducted}} in a manner befitting the husband's social status, and in accordance with the local custom. Prominent rabbis of the Middle Ages clarified this, stating that the husband must make any provisions required by local burial customs, potentially including the hiring of mourners and the erection of a tombstone. According to the Talmud, and later rabbinic writers, if the husband was absent, or refused to <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> a rabbinical court should arrange the wife's funeral, selling some of the husband's property in order to defray the costs.|$|E

500|$|According to the literature, {{it appears}} that the {{majority}} of free Athenians owned at least one slave. Aristophanes, in Plutus, portrays poor peasants who have several slaves; Aristotle defines a house as containing freemen and slaves. Conversely, not owning even one slave was a clear sign of poverty. In the celebrated discourse of Lysias For the Invalid, a cripple pleading for a pension explains [...] "my income is very small and now I'm required to <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> myself and do not even have the means to purchase a slave who can <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> for me." [...] However, the huge slave populations of the Romans were unknown in ancient Greece. When Athenaeus cites the case of Mnason, friend of Aristotle and owner of a thousand slaves, this appears to be exceptional. Plato, owner of five slaves {{at the time of his}} death, describes the very rich as owning 50 slaves.|$|E

500|$|During the {{classical}} period, the main justification for slavery was economic. From a philosophical point of view, {{the idea of}} [...] "natural" [...] slavery emerged at the same time; thus, as Aeschylus states in The Persians, the Greeks [...] "f no man are they called the slaves or vassals", while the Persians, as Euripides states in Helen, [...] "are all slaves, except one" [...] — the Great King. Hippocrates theorizes about this latent idea {{at the end of}} the 5th century BC. According to him, the temperate climate of Anatolia produced a placid and submissive people. This explanation is reprised by Plato, then Aristotle in Politics, where he develops the concept of [...] "natural slavery": [...] "for he that can foresee with his mind is naturally ruler and naturally master, and he that can <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> with his body is subject and naturally a slave." [...] As opposed to an animal, a slave can comprehend reason but [...] "…has not got the deliberative part at all." ...|$|E

The idea for the episode was pitched by Vitti, who suggested an episode in which Lisa meets girls who {{thought she was a}} college student. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 12, 2002. Jean thought the idea was [...] "brilliant", and the subplot involving Bart in a [...] "germ-free" [...] plastic bubble was conceived by the writers wanting to make [...] "the most different subplot from an intellectual college plot" [...] they could think of. A scene in the episode shows Lisa talking to Bart on the branch of a tree in their garden. Bart says the line [...] "You can't believe what that sunset looks like to me", to which Lisa replies [...] "That's not a sunset, that's a bird on fire." [...] Originally, Lisa's line read [...] " [...] that's a plane on fire," [...] however, after the September 11 attacks, the line was considered offensive and was changed. [...] " [...] since we work so far ahead we usually <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> that are sort of timeless stories," [...] Jean said, [...] "but {{every once in a while}} there's something that turns out to be ironic in a bad way, then we have to change it." ...|$|E

The official Neighbours website states that Donna has become a warm, loveable, charming and playful girl. Her integration into the street and the lives of the other residents has matured Donna and she leads the normal life she always wanted. In May 2009, Robbie said that Donna is a [...] "really likeable character" [...] and that she gets to play out funny and crazy storylines while playing her. In November of that year, it was revealed that Robbie had begged the scriptwriters to let Donna go off the rails or go to rehab. Robbie said that she would like a dramatic storyline, but the show's G rating makes it difficult. Robbie also said that she enjoys playing Donna, as she is [...] "great" [...] and a [...] "bit crazy". She added [...] "I'm really glad I get to play her and not an average, boring teenage girl.
