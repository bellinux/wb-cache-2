Major discontinuities in slope approximate the ratio 12 / 88 for Cr to Fe in the 20 and 40 % Ni alloy series, and 14 / 86 for Cr to Ni in the 50 and 60 % Ni alloy series. These ratios correspond to observed critical composi-tions for passivity in the Cr-Fe and Cr-Ni binary systems.

40|$|Molybdenum-bearing alloys {{are widely}} used in {{industry}} because of their excellent corrosion resistance. However, the role of molybdenum in passivation is a subject {{which has been a}} matter for discussion and controversy for many years. In the previous work carried out in this laboratory, Professor Castle and Dr Qiu suggested that molybdenum oxide might provide the nuclei for formation of the passive film. This hypothesis is the basis of the present work. In order to find out the evidence for the existence of the molybdenum oxide nuclei, furthermore, to establish a model of passivation for the molybdenum-bearing alloys, the passivation of molybdenum-bearing alloys are investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), especially in-situ AFM, in conjunction with SEM and TEM. During the passivation study, {{it was found that the}} chemical composition on anodically polarised surfaces varied with potential. For 516 alloy, the peak value of molybdenum in the surface is at the low potential of the passive region close to the <b>Flade</b> <b>potential.</b> Therefore, molybdenum exerts its greatest function in this potential region. A further AFM study at this potential revealed, surprisingly, that a platelet layer formed on the passivation surface. The dendritic structure on the surface of the platelets presented under the high resolution of STM, which shows the crystallization property of the platelets. These platelets are mainly composed of chromium and molybdenum oxides and they are only found in the passivation of the molybdenum-bearing alloy, so the formation of the platelets may be associated with molybdenum nucleation in passivation. The in-situ AFM studies provide the evidence for the formation and disappearance of the platelets during the passivation of molybdenum-bearing alloys, i. e. the platelets form at the early stage of passivation and they gradually merge into the passive film if they are not disturbed by the environment. Based on the above finding, the role of molybdenum in passivation is proposed as following: molybdenum oxide precipitated on the surface seeds chromium oxide to form platelets at the early stage of passivation and the formed platelet layer prohibits the dissolution of the passive species from the metal. By this way, molybdenum facilitates the formation of the passive film on alloys. Using Fe-Cr-Mo duplex stainless steels, the corrosion of molybdenum-bearing alloys are studied in HCl and the kinetics of the corrosion are traced by in-situ AFM. During corrosion, it was observed that the ferritic phase in duplex stainless steel dissolves more rapidly than the austenitic phase and the dissolution occurs on the austenite preferentially along grain boundaries, sub-grain boundaries and the planes with high energy. By switching the electrochemical condition from active dissolution to passivation and then changing it back, it is found that under the passivation condition after the active dissolution, the corrosion changes from selective dissolution of the crystallographic feature to general corrosion. This situation persists even though the electrochemical condition changes back to the active condition from the passivation condition. Since AFM is a new technique and this is one of the first attempts at applying it to a corrosion study, an in-depth explanation of the images obtained from a corroded rough surface is an important topic on which so far little work has been reported. In this study, therefore, the artifacts and the reality of the structure in AFM images obtained in the corrosion study are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Texturing {{of silicon}} wafers is an {{important}} process step in fabrication of solar cells {{in order to reduce}} the reflection of incoming light radiation on the solar cell surfaces. The conventional wet chemical etching methods have clear limitations in etching and texturing of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers. Chemical etching of mc-Si wafers in alkaline solutions results in a coarse and non uniform surface morphology since the dissolution rate depends on the grain orientation. In contrast to alkaline etching, textures formed by acidic etchants (HF+HNO 3) are uniform. However, acidic etching is difficult to control, the disposal of the waste is expensive and the method is in general environmentally hazardous. The aim of this thesis is to study an environmentally friendly etching method, which is supposed to be an alternative to acidic texturing of both single and multicrystalline B-doped silicon wafers. The method is based on anodic polarization of Si in alkaline solutions. In spite of the fact that silicon is one of the most studied elements due to its applicability in electronic devices, its electrochemistry in alkaline solutions at increased temperatures and at high potentials has been scarcely investigated. In the first part of the thesis monocrystalline (100) and (111) silicon samples were polarized in a strong alkaline solution at different temperatures and potentials in order to study anodic passivation mechanism. In the second part single- and multicrystalline Si-wafers were textured by utilizing electrochemical treatment in hot alkaline solutions. Anodic dissolution and passivation of Si (100) and Si (111) were studied by potentiodynamic and potentiostatic polarizations in 2 M KOH at temperatures ranging from 23 oC to 70 oC and at potentials from the open circuit potential (OCP) to 14. 5 V (with respect to Ag/AgCl reference electrode). Potentiostatic polarization experiments were performed on as-received (mechanically sawed or polished) and pre-etched (at OCP in the alkaline test solution) samples. The composition and thickness of the reaction products formed on the surfaces were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The morphology of the surfaces was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The oxide products formed during passivation was analyzed after polarization to the <b>Flade</b> <b>potential</b> at about 1 V. A thin (about 1 nm) homogeneous layer of Sioxyhydroxide (H 2 SiO 3) is formed at this potential. It is formed on both crystal orientations independent of temperature. The hydrated silica layer is gradually transformed into the stoichiometric oxide SiO 2 by polarizing Si (100) above the <b>Flade</b> <b>potential</b> at 23 oC or 30 oC. The phase change is indicated by an oxidation peak at around 4 V during potentiodynamic polarizations. Further, XPS analysis shows that both hydrated and dehydrated silica coexist at this potential. The oxide thickness formed during potentiodynamic polarization to 14. 5 V is 22 nm. Oxygen evolution is observed at about 4 V. At higher potentials the oxygen evolution is inhibited due to growth of thick oxide. The stoichiometric oxide SiO 2 forms and grows with increasing potential and exposure time on Si (111) at all temperatures irrespective of pre-etching. The thicknesses of the oxide are in the range 3 nm to 40 nm depending on the polarization method, potential and exposure time. The formation and growth of SiO 2 on Si (100) at 40 oC and higher temperatures depends on surface pre-etching. Polarization of pre-etched Si (100) at 40 oC and higher temperatures does not form SiO 2 on the surface. The compound present after polarization at all potentials was the thin, 1 nm thick hydrated silica layer. It was formed irrespectively of the polarization method or potential. Thus, pre-etching {{is an important}} parameter in the oxidation mechanism of Si (100). Oxide growth on non-pre-etched Si (100) at the high temperatures was similar to that of Si (111). However, pre-etching of Si (100) for more than 10 min at the high temperatures results in formation of pyramidal hillocks on the surface. During polarization at the high temperatures, the pyramidal hillocks are dissolved and the surface becomes flattened. Hydrated silica layer is the only detected oxidation product at all potentials. In the second part of the thesis a method is developed for electrochemical texturing of as-cut multicrystalline and single crystals, Si (111) and Si (100), in alkaline solutions. The wafers are potentiostatically polarized in 2 M KOH and 4 M KOH at temperatures in the range 30 oC to 70 oC. The applied potentials are varied from 20 V to 50 V (referred to Pt-counter electrode). Before the polarization, the samples are pre-etched in the test solution to remove the deformed zone on the as-cut surfaces. The morphology of the textured surfaces, the composition and thickness of the surface products and the light reflectivity are analyzed by utilizing SEM, XPS and Lambda UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer, respectively. Pre-etching of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers results in anisotropic surface morphology with protrusions and valleys due to etching of different grains at different etch rates in alkaline solutions. During anodic polarization at potentials above 20 V and at temperatures at 40 oC and above, all the grains are uniformly textured. At 25 V and 30 V, micro-pits are formed on the protrusions. With increasing the potential to 40 V and 50 V, concave cavities are formed on the entire surface. Isotropic texturing is achieved. Isotropic texturing on mc-Si wafers is characterized by formation of the concave cavities of 1 to 10 μm. Inside the micropits and cavities, nano-pits are formed. Their lateral size is in the range 100 nm to 200 nm. At 50 V, the nano-pits are etched away and the cavities become shallower due to enhanced dissolution. The lowest average reflectivity, 17 %, is achieved on electrochemically textured surface after polarization at 40 V for 10 min in 4 M KOH at 50 oC, which is 50 % lower than the reflectivity on the pre-etched surface. A model for the isotropic texturing mechanism is proposed based on XPS analysis and electrochemical measurements. It is suggested that the formation of pits and concave cavities is due to local pH variations caused by oxygen evolution reaction, which control formation and dissolution of the surface oxide. Protons formed during oxygen evolution reduce the pH on the surface locally. Hereby, SiO 2 becomes stable and grows on the surface in the low pH area. For prolonged exposure the growth of the oxide passivates the surface and lowers the oxidation rate of Si and water. Due to high alkalinity of the electrolyte, oxide dissolves at weak points thus creating pits. Oxidation of silicon and oxygen evolution occurs at the oxide breakdown sites. Continuous formation and local dissolution of oxide causes the formation of micro-pitted surface. Formation of pits and concave cavities are not affected by changes in the electrolyte concentration and temperature. However, pre-etching is an important factor in obtaining the uniform textures on all the grains of the mc-Si wafers. This is due to the fact that pre-etching influences the formation of SiO 2 on (100) grains at high temperatures. Isotropic textures are not obtained on mc-Si wafers containing significant number of (100) grains when pre-etched for more than 10 min. On Si (111) wafer surfaces, pre-etching results in formation of steps and terraces. The terraces contain true (111) planes are stable and steps contain fast etching planes such as (100) and (110) are more reactive. During polarization, terrace planes are passivated by formation of a stable oxide, and pits are initiated at the step edges. With increasing potential, temperature and exposure time, pitting spreads over the terrace planes. The surface reflectance is decreased with increasing pit coverage. It is demonstrated that the electrochemical texturing method can effectively replace the present isotropic etching by acidic etchants. Both single crystal and multicrystalline materials have successfully been textured. PhD i materialteknologiPhD in Materials Science and Engineerin...|$|E
