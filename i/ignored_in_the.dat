5|$|Microscopic {{theoretical}} {{treatment of}} fluid phases can become quite complicated, {{owing to the}} high material density, meaning that strong interactions, hard-core repulsions, and many-body correlations cannot be <b>ignored.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of liquid crystals, anisotropy {{in all of these}} interactions further complicates analysis. There are a number of fairly simple theories, however, that can at least predict the general behavior of the phase transitions in liquid crystal systems.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} dealt with {{comparative}} studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot, among others. The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth {{has been done by}} several authors such as Martin Aronson, and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who believe that they have parallels that should not be <b>ignored.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these religions are similar.|$|E

Nurses encounter swearing from patients and their carers, staff and managers and use swearwords in communication with each other.

50|$|As {{early as}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hellenistic period, {{there was a}} {{tendency}} towards a state of diglossia between the Attic literary language and the constantly developing vernacular Koiné.

5|$|Castelli {{is largely}} <b>ignored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> historiography of Argentina. Most historians focus {{instead on the}} {{disputes}} between Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra in the Junta, with Castelli described in passing as a supporter of Moreno. Despite of {{his role in the}} May Revolution, he was not the clear leader of it, as José Gervasio Artigas was for the Cry of Asencio or Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla for the Cry of Dolores. The May Revolution was instead the result of the convergence of diverse factions that shared the desire to remove the viceroy, and different historians highlight different specific factions. Castelli is largely ignored in Bolivia as well. His support of indigenous rights—still an ongoing issue in the country—and his religious ideas strongly affect the way he is perceived there.|$|E
5|$|Henry and his {{crusade to}} Finland {{were also a}} part of the legend of King Eric. The {{appendix}} of the early 13th century Västgötalagen, which has a short description of Eric's memorable deeds, also makes no reference to Henry or the crusade. Henry and the crusade are both fully present only in a version of Eric's legend that dates to 1344. Similarities in the factual content and phraseology regarding the common events indicate that either one of the legends has acted as the model for the other. Henry's legend is commonly considered to have been written during the 1280s or 1290s at the latest, for the consecration of the Cathedral of Turku in 1300, when his alleged remains were translated there from Nousiainen, a parish not far from Turku. Yet, even as late as in the 1470s, the crusade legend was <b>ignored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chronica regni Gothorum, a chronicle of the history of Sweden, written by Ericus Olai, the Canon of the Uppsala cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in the Arab world, by 900 {{the great}} Greek herbals had been {{translated}} and copies lodged in centres {{of learning in}} the Byzantine empire of the eastern Mediterranean including Byzantium, Damascus, Cairo and Baghdad where they were combined with the botanical and pharmacological lore of the Orient. In the medieval Islamic world, Muslim botanists and Muslim physicians made a major contribution to the knowledge of herbal medicines. Those associated with this period include Mesue Maior (Masawaiyh, 777–857) who, in his Opera Medicinalia, synthesised the knowledge of Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Indians and Babylonians, this work was complemented by the medical encyclopaedia of Avicenna (Ibn Sina, 980–1037). Avicenna’s Canon of Medicine was used for centuries in both East and West. During this period Islamic science protected classical botanical knowledge that had been <b>ignored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West and Muslim pharmacy thrived.|$|E

5|$|Most in {{the crowd}} {{believed}} they knew what would follow; Constantine and Maxentius, the only adult sons of a reigning emperor, men who had long been preparing to succeed their fathers, would be granted the title of caesar. Constantine had traveled through Palestine at the right hand of Diocletian, and {{was present at the}} palace in Nicomedia in 303 and 305. It is likely that Maxentius received the same treatment. In Lactantius' account, when Diocletian announced that he was to resign, the entire crowd turned to face Constantine. It was not to be: Severus and Maximin were declared caesars. Maximin appeared and took Diocletian's robes. On the same day, Severus received his robes from Maximian in Milan. Constantius succeeded Maximian as augustus of the West, but Constantine and Maxentius were entirely <b>ignored</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transition of power. This did not bode well for the future security of the tetrarchic system.|$|E
5|$|Until late 1939, A/S {{work had}} largely been <b>ignored.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> opening {{months of the}} trade defence war, September 1939 to early 1940, three main points arose in this respect. Firstly, the Germans were {{incapable}} of maintaining a sustained anti-shipping campaign owing to {{a small number of}} U-boats. Second, the Air Staff's fear of massed air attacks on shipping did not take place and could be discarded. Thirdly, despite the first two points, losses to Allied shipping from U-boat attack was enough for importance of A/S to increase. The Royal Navy's belief in an ASDIC equipped surface fleet to effectively sweep the seas clear of U-boats proved unfounded (owing to the limitations of ASDIC and vulnerability of surface vessels). Coastal Command aircraft had proven best able to locate U-boats, but the flawed anti-submarine bombs (ASBs) meant that they could not inflict severe damage to enemy submarines.|$|E
5|$|Once Jardine left Oxford, {{he began}} to qualify as a {{solicitor}} while still playing for Surrey. He made steady progress {{over the next three}} seasons but was overshadowed by other amateur batsmen. His contemporaries at Oxford and Cambridge attracted more attention in the press, as did the next generation of amateur batsmen. He was appointed vice-captain to Fender for the 1924 season. Several professionals, such as Jack Hobbs, could have been made captain, but Jardine was preferred as an amateur. In that season, Jardine was selected for the Gentlemen v Players match {{for the first time and}} came third in the Surrey averages. In all first-class matches, he scored 1,249 runs at an average of 40.29. In the following season, Jardine was less successful, scoring fewer runs at a lower average and with a highest score of 87 (1,020 runs at 30.90). Suggestions made in the press that Jardine should captain the Gentlemen with a view towards the future of the England Test team, were <b>ignored.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> event, owing to an injury sustained playing village cricket, he was unable to appear in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. In 1926, Jardine had his most successful season to date, with 1,473 runs (average 46.03), although he was again overshadowed by other players and by the attention given to the Ashes series being played. Towards the end of the season, his batting became more attractive and his rate of scoring increased as {{he began to}} play more shots. His assurance and judgement against all bowling, even international bowlers, increased and he scored 538 runs in his final ten innings.|$|E
