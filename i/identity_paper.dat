40|$|The European Commission’s draft {{directive}} (October 2002) proposes {{to introduce a}} squeeze-out right and a sell-out right and to set the price in a mandatory bid equal to the highest price paid in the 6 or 12 preceding months.

In takeovers of widely held targets, the squeeze-out right and the sell-out right {{have the potential to}} resolve the collective action problem among shareholders, thereby ensuring the success of value-increasing takeovers and the failure of value-decreasing takeovers. Unlike the sell-out right, the mandatory bid rule requires competition by the incumbent to provide additional shareholder protection.

40|$|Abstract Purpose – In {{the context}} of a merger, the {{management}} of corporate identity – in particular of corporate names and logos – assumes a critical role. This paper aims to explore how name and logo design characteristics, and specifically figurativeness, influence consumer preferences in {{the context of}} a brand merger, in the banking sector. Design/methodology/approach – This study develops a typology of the alternative corporate identity structures that may be assumed in {{the context of a}} brand merger by drawing on a literature review and secondary data, as well as an exploratory study analyzing consumers’ preferences regarding alternative branding strategies. Findings – The results suggest that there is a clear preference for figurative logos. Furthermore, there is evidence that logos may be as important as the company name in a merger situation, in terms of assuring consumers that there remains a connection to the brand’s past. The data show that the logo chosen by consumers reflects their aesthetic responses, whereas the selected name reflects their evaluation of the brand’s offers or its presence in the market. Originality/value – The paper uses an innovative research design which gives respondents freedom to choose their preferred solution; hence, the richness of the results is enhanced. The results should guide managers in their evaluation and choices regarding post-merger branding strategies.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{explores the}} impact of {{institutional}} changes in the Australian Higher Education Sector (AHES) on academics in entrepreneurial graduate schools of business. It addresses questions about the causes, nature and effects of change, and ultimately, {{the impact on the}} values and lives of 21 academics at two points in time, 2002 - 3 and 2008. In addition to reviewing literature, qualitative methods of document analysis and interviews provide the data for the research. The framework for the analysis of data is based on Laughlin’s (1991) ‘skeletal’ theory of organisation change which adapts concepts from Habermas’ (1984; 87) theory of societal change. The impacts of change are viewed from the perspective of organisation participants, the academics. For the majority of these academics, the findings of the research indicate that, in the face of loss of ownership and the imposition of modernisation practices, they maintained their belief in academic values but withdrew from active engagement with their school and institution. The thesis is presented in six chapters and six papers. With the exception of Chapter One, which introduces the thesis and its contributions, and Chapter Six, which summarises and concludes the work, the four chapters in between provide background detail on the literature; the theoretical approach; the research design and method; and the findings. The six papers complement the chapters by presenting the outcomes of the research at various stages. They are ordered {{in such a way as}} to offer general overviews of the Australian Higher Education Sector (Paper One) and business schools (Paper Two) before providing more specific focus on the impacts of modernisation practices (Paper Three); effects of change on academic <b>identity</b> (<b>Paper</b> Four); and the role of disciplinarity on academic values and <b>identity</b> (<b>Paper</b> Five). Research results from the first period of research, 2002 - 3, are reported in Papers Three, Four and Five. Paper Six is the final paper. It provides a comparison of results for both periods with an analysis of change and its impacts using Laughlin’s (1991) framework for organisation change. Chapter Six concludes the thesis with suggested implications for policy and further research. In relation to policy, it is suggested that current government intentions to shift higher education institutions from economic to social institutions will be dependent on the ability of institutions to unravel ten years of modernisation practices aimed at controlling rather than supporting academic endeavour. Arising from this is a challenge to business schools to develop value propositions that better reflect their role as part of a social institution and not an institutional ‘cash cow’. Further research is suggested in two areas: first, in understanding the lifeworld perspectives of academic executives and heads of school about their role in absorbing or facilitating change; and second, in understanding how business schools are able to develop and implement appropriate value propositions. Overall this thesis is a response to Henkel’s (2005, p. 166) call for further empirical research into academics’ lives “to test the strength of values and identity in different institutional settings”. It does this by addressing several gaps in the literature on higher education, specifically Australian higher education. The production of a qualitative and longitudinal study within a theoretical framework contributes to overcoming the paucity of research employing these methods or applying theoretical interpretations of data within higher education. Additionally, the thesis makes a contribution to the under-researched areas of academic values and value change generally, and Australian business schools, specifically by focusing on the values of Australian business school academics in times of change...|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy by Published Works. A reflexive analysis of five peer reviewed published papers reveals how socio-cultural and political discourses and individual agency compete to shape {{the identity of the}} learner-writer. It is posited that although hegemonic political discourses construct ‘schooling literacy’ (Meek 1988) which frame the socio-cultural contexts in which texts, authors, teachers and leaners develop; the socio-cultural standpoint of the individual makes possible conscious construction of counter discourses. Writer identity is integral to the compositional process. However, writer identity is mediated by, on the one hand, dominant discourses of literacy that inform current pedagogies of writing (Paper One) and on the other by socio-cultural narratives that shape <b>identity</b> (<b>Paper</b> Three). A synthesis of Gramsci’s notion of cultural hegemony and Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory is used to explain the constraining function of dominant discourses in literacy education. These works largely fall within a qualitative paradigm, although a mixed-method approach was adopted for the data collection of Papers Four and Five. The methods these papers had in common were the use of survey and documentary analysis of reflective journals. A semi-structured interview with a focus group was the third method used to collect data for Paper Five. Individual semi-structured interviews were used to collect partial life-histories for Paper Two and textual analysis of pupils’ narrative writing was the main method used for Paper One. Paper Three involved a rhizotextual auto-ethnographic analysis of original poetry. Findings suggest pedagogies which minimise or negate the identity of the writer are counter-productive in facilitating writer efficacy. It is suggested, the teaching of writing should be premised on approaches that encourage the writer to draw upon personal, inherited and secondary narratives. In this conceptualisation of writing, the writer is simultaneously composing and exploring aspects of self. However, the self is not a fixed entity and writing is viewed as a process by which identity emerges through reflexive engagement with the compositional process. The corollary is that pedagogy of writing needs to embrace the identity of the writer, whilst also allowing space for the writer’s ‘becoming’...|$|E
40|$|As media personalities such as Ellen DeGeneres, Melissa Etheridge, k. d. Lang, and Elton John openly "come out," or {{disclose}} their sexual orientation, people are generally becoming {{more aware of}} homosexuality (Handy, 1997). Within the school system gay and lesbian adolescents are more willing than ever before to be open about their sexual orientation. However, these students face an array of problems stemming from such difficulties as lack of family and peer support, resources, and positive role models (Shortall 1998). What follows {{is a series of}} three papers that attempt to inform school counsellors, and others working within the school system, about homosexuality and the issues that adolescent homosexuals must confront. [...] Paper one describes the historical basis underlying the current views held about homosexuality. Understanding the historical development of homosexual identity helps us to recognize why mainstream society reacts as it does to homosexuals and homosexual behaviour. These reactions reflect the attitudes that most North Americans hold towards homosexuality. The impact that these attitudes have upon homosexual adolescents can be devastating, as the manifestation of internal and external homophobia can be grave. By being knowledgeable about the current attitudes towards homosexuality and how these views are expressed, counsellors and other professionals within the school system, may be more effective in working with gay and lesbian students and the issues they face. [...] Home and school environments can be stressful for a homosexual adolescent or for any adolescent still unsure of his or her sexual <b>identity.</b> <b>Paper</b> two concentrates on the issues faced by homosexual students within each of these environments. Regardless whether adolescents are unsure of their sexual identity or if they are open about their homosexuality, the homophobic atmosphere in which they live may result in several developmental problems. The school counsellor can {{play an important role in}} the healthy development of adolescent homosexuals as they lack the traditional venues of support and guidance that are available for their heterosexual peers. [...] Paper three concentrates on the role a counsellor can play in the school environment to help make it a safer place for both those homosexual students who have declared their sexual orientation, and for those still unsure. Not only will the school counsellor's role includes working with students, but it is crucial for services to be provided to the homosexual adolescent's family, to the other personnel working within the school, and to the general school population. Hopefully, paper three will provide useful material that school counsellors can draw upon when they find themselves working with gay and lesbian adolescents. As well, it is hoped that these papers will bring attention to the importance of this issue within the school system and the need for further knowledge and exploration into adolescent homosexuality...|$|E

40|$|According to a {{dominant}} discourse in contemporary writings and research, {{we are living}} in a Knowledge Economy where knowledge is seen as the pre-eminent resource and the key to success for individuals as well as organizations and nations. Consequently, much effort in management research has been dedicated to devising new concepts and theories such as the knowledge-based theory of the firm and the intellectual capital perspective, all premised on the assumption that knowledge work is somehow different from other forms of work. But what, actually, is knowledge work? And what is it that makes it so different? This dissertation represents an attempt to make some sense of this discourse. Research themes investigate the role of tangible and intangible dimensions of knowledge work and organizations. Particular attention is paid to organizational identity and the physical work environment. The notion of identity is central to the Knowledge Economy Rhetoric, while the physical setting is a neglected, but potentially important, aspect of knowledge work and identity construction. Various theoretical and methodological perspectives were applied throughout the research process to illuminate these themes. The thesis covers two empirical case studies; one of a small high-tech firm in the telecommunications sector as it developed a knowledge based strategy. The other study explored the relationship between the design of the office and identity construction in a large IT/management consulting firm. In addition, a study of the literature on the organizational category of knowledge-intensive firms was conducted to explore the dominant constructions of knowledge work within the research community. The results from these studies are presented in five papers. While addressing different questions, the papers all deal with some aspect of sensemaking of, or in, knowledge work. The first paper describes how the management team in the case company went through a process {{to make sense of the}} intangible dimensions of their organization. The second paper is a conceptual treatise outlining an alternative conceptualization of strategy for knowledge-intensive firms that emphasizes the importance of <b>identity.</b> <b>Paper</b> three provides an analysis of how the category of knowledge-intensive firms is used in the research literature and the consequences thereof. In paper four branding is analyzed as a management practice. The last paper discusses the role of emotion, ambivalence and embodied experience of the physical environment in identity construction. The exposition reflects further on the insights from this journey and what they entail for making sense of knowledge work. It is argued that a better understanding of knowledge work has to take the knowledge worker – the individual – as the starting point for theorizing. Taking this position requires us to scrutinize the theoretical perspectives that guide our conceptualizations of the knowledge worker. Theoretical perspectives are constructions that allow us to see certain things and not others. Current conceptualizations are, by necessity, extensions of earlier dominant perspectives or worldviews. Based on the findings from the empirical studies, an alternative perspective is proposed that takes the embodied experience of the knowledge worker as a point of departure. Implications of this perspective for conceptualizing and studying knowledge work are then discussed. QC 2010091...|$|E
40|$|Tobacco smoking {{constitutes}} the largest cause of impaired health and premature death in Norway. Notwithstanding this fact, 26 {{percent of the}} Norwegian population smoke daily, 11 percent smoke occasionally and still large numbers of adolescents are recruited to the smoking population each year. Thus, there is evidently a need to develop more effective strategies to increase the quit rate among smokers {{and to ensure that}} those who do not smoke refrain from smoking. Several authors have emphasised that to further improve our understanding of smoking uptake and cessation, studies need to be theory-driven. This thesis demonstrates how theoretical perspectives from various social psychological frameworks may contribute to explaining smoking cessation and initiation. Paper I concerned parents' intentions not to smoke indoors in the presence of their children. Paper II addressed students' intentions to quit smoking (Time 1) and the subsequent making of the quitting attempt six months later (Time 2). Paper III concerned adolescents' intentions to reduce smoking (Time 1) and the subsequent behaviour one year later (Time 2), and Paper IV addressed adolescents' intentions to refrain from smoking (Time 1) and self-reported smoking behaviour one year later (Time 2). The impact of the school-based smoking prevention programme BE smokeFREE was also examined. Common to the papers was that the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was used as a theoretical framework. According to the TPB, the more positive a person’s attitude, the stronger the subjective norms and the greater the perceived control over the behaviour (PBC), the stronger the intention to perform the behaviour and correspondingly, the more likely the person is to perform the behaviour. The TPB has been successfully applied in predicting a wide range of behaviours, including smoking. Nevertheless, several authors have argued that the model has some important limitations, e. g., (i) the TPB does not capture affective processes, (ii) it does not account for all sources of social influence, and (iii) the specified predictors are not always sufficient in terms of behavioural prediction. Accordingly, research has shown that moral norms, self-identity, group identity, descriptive norms/group norms, anticipated affective reactions, past behaviour, and action planning are useful additions to the TPB. However, these variables have seldom been applied in the domain of smoking. Thus, one aim of this thesis was to obtain a better understanding of factors that are important with respect to smoking initiation and cessation. A second aim was to empirically illuminate the TPB by including additional variables in the model. Hence, in addition to the TPB components, self-identity was assessed in all papers, along with moral norms. Moreover, the impact of past behaviour (Paper I, II & III), descriptive norms/group norms (Paper III & IV), positive and negative anticipated affective reactions (Paper I & II), group <b>identity</b> (<b>Paper</b> II), action planning (Paper III), smoking by valued others (Paper IV), and alcohol use (Paper IV) was examined. Several interaction effects were also tested he thesis is based on empirical data from three different studies. Data were collected by questionnaires in three target groups in Norway: Parents of children born in 1998 (mean age = 33 years, Paper I), university students aged 26 years at Time 1 (Paper II), adolescents aged 14 years at Time 1 (Paper III & Paper IV). The samples contained data from 145 - 722 participants. Two of the surveys were longitudinal, with 6 and 12 months between the measurement points. The results from Paper I revealed that subjective norms and PBC accounted for 56 % adjusted R 2) of the variance in parents’ intentions not to smoke indoors in the presence of their children...|$|E
40|$|Background: Faecal {{incontinence}} (FI) and constipation {{affects a}} significant amount of the nursing home (NH) patients. In addition, many of the patients use laxatives regularly. Both faecal incontinence and constipation are bothersome conditions associated with increased risk of morbidity and reduced quality of life. There is a lack of studies investigating bowel problems among NH patients using validated and comprehensive instruments able to capture the complexity in NH patients. The level of awareness among health care staff regarding assessment and treatment options for FI seems limited. Aim: The aim of this thesis was to investigate prevalence and associations of faecal incontinence, constipation and laxative use among NH patients using the standardized and comprehensive Resident Assessment Instrument for Long-Term Care Facilities (interRAI LTCF). Secondly, the aim was to develop an implementation strategy for change in FI care in order to achieve a reduction in FI prevalence rates among patients. Results: Study I and II had a cross-sectional design including 261 patients in NHs in one Norwegian municipality. Study I showed prevalence rate of FI was 42. 1 % or 54 %, depending on the chosen cut-off on the scale measuring FI in interRAI LTCF. In order to get some additional information on FI St. Mark’s Incontinence score was used, resulting in a prevalence rate of 70. 1 %. This illustrates the importance of using clear definitions together with standardized instruments when investigating FI. Deficiencies in ADL, cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence and diarrhea were identified as risk factors, and involvement in activities and instability in health/frailty were identified as protective factors. In study II the prevalence of constipation was 23. 4 % and 67. 1 % of the patients used laxatives regularly. Balance problems, urinary incontinence, hypothyroidism, and Parkinson’s disease were identified as risk factors for constipation. Risk factors for laxative use were reduced ability to communicate and number of drugs other than laxatives, while anti-dementia drugs and being involved in activities were protective factors. Analyses using mixed effects models showed that most of the total variance in prevalence rates of faecal incontinence (88 %), constipation (90. 3 %) and laxative use (97 %), was due to differences in individual patient characteristics, not variance between NH units. Study III was a pilot study preceding a cluster-randomized controlled trial (C-RCT). The pilot was designed as a three armed external pilot study investigating feasibility, acceptability, and adherence of two educational programmes for care staff concerning NH patients’ FI. Data was collected at baseline (t 0) and after 3 months (t 1). The study included patients (t 0 n = 62, t 1 n = 57) and registered nurses (t 0 n = 7, t 1 n = 7) in NHs. Quantitative data was analysed by descriptive statistics. Qualitative data from one focus group interview and four individual interviews were analysed by qualitative content analyses. The pilot study found the planned C-RCT to be feasible with one major and some minor modification. The major modification was the necessity to reduce the main study from a three-armed design to a two-armed design. Important barriers identified were sub-optimal use of skill-mix, problems of communicating assessments and care plans, and isolated RNs with an indistinct nurse <b>identity.</b> <b>Paper</b> IV is the protocol describing the C-RCT evaluating a multifaceted educational programme for care staff on assessment and treatment of patients’ FI. Conclusion: Prevalence of FI, constipation and laxative use are confirmed high. Variance in prevalence rates is mainly explained by different patient characteristics/ health deficiencies. Hence, individualized care matching the patients’ deficiencies might be a key to managing bowel problems. There is a need for studies evaluating interventions targeting bowel problems in NHs. Further, {{there is a need for}} studies evaluating different implementation strategies. The interRAI LTCF is a useful instrument by its combination of a comprehensive range of individual items and scales that make it possible to capture a holistic picture of the complex NH patient, allowing for comparison of immediate and long-term change in patients across setting...|$|E

40|$|Symposium Theme: Attitudes and PrestigeSession - C 01 - 05 : Polycentric {{approaches}} to language and transnational migrationTransnationality research {{has emerged in}} the past 20 years in cultural anthropology, population studies, economics, social and cultural geography. Research in sociolinguistics, however, has produced little on this subject, yet a sociolinguistic approach can provide unique insights into the micro social relations of these people in transition and complement the often quantitative {{approaches to}} transnationalism and globalization. Ong (1999) exposes needs for observing the environs concerning transnationals, arguing that if “we {{pay attention to the}} transnational practices and imaginings of the nomadic subject and the social conditions that enable his flexibility, we obtain a different picture of how nation states articulate with capitalism in late modernity”. Chinese who migrate from their original homeland to the West no longer always settle permanently in their host countries. Instead, a growing number of Chinese emigrants have become a “moving population”. Once they have acquired foreign citizenship, many return to their original homeland to seek better economic and social opportunities. In 2000 the Hong Kong census and statistics department reported that 118, 400 people in Hong Kong are return migrants who hold dual nationalities. With this new trend in mobility and flexibility in citizenship in Hong Kong, there have been studies done in population research and the social geography of returnees (Ley and Kobayashi 2005, Sussman 2005, Waters 2005, 2007, 2008; Salaff et al. 2010) and China (Ip 2006), but little has been done in linguistics/sociolinguistics except the researcher’s previous research on returnees’ linguistic practices and ideologies (Chen 2008, 2015). This research takes a multi-methodological approach to return migration by incorporating current cultural anthropological theories on transnationalism and mobilities, sociolinguistic analysis of multilingualism, and theories of language ideologies and identities. Examples from the Multilingual Hong Kong Corpus (data collected by the researcher from 2002 to 2016) will be presented to reveal sociolinguistic insights of these returnee multilingual practices as compare to their local counterparts. The paper will further examine the transnational practices of individuals and the condition (or lack of) that enable their mobilities both in physical and symbolic/social levels, and how these practices can be understood in times of sweeping sociopolitical changes with evolving relationship between individuals and the nation states.

40|$|When {{looking into}} officer cadets’ {{identity}}, social identity appears {{to play a}} decisive role among officer cadets when participating in exercises. In the winter time, using the uniqueness of a military exercise, cadets were left standing half-naked and blindfolded on a wharf and given the offer of jumping into the icy ocean or not jumping. The offer {{was the first step}} into a reflecting dialogue, fundamental to the topic this thesis is exploring: how reflection in situation discloses identity and how this identity influences action. Paper I (N= 21) explores the tension between the individual self and social identity as it came into play in an ambiguous military situation. In the reflecting dialogue the cadets reflected on the reasons for the decision they made. The analysis of the reflecting dialogue developed three categories: The personal level, jumping was associated with a possibility to learn about stress and coping; the group level, the cadets took on a social identity in which refusing to jump elicited feelings of exclusion from the group; the organizational level, the officer role and norms associated with the exercise facilitated action that confirmed the values of duty and honor. The social influence that emerged as a central force in this first paper was then examined further. Paper II (N= 128) examines the relative influence of the officers’ personal and social identity as predictors of action in a military situation. When the officers were given the option of jumping into the ocean, 69 % of them decided to jump. The reasons for such behavior were explored through logistic regression in two steps. Step 1, Personal Characteristics, with such predictors as hardiness, resilience, and risk perception, predicted in different directions and with limited power. Step 2, Social Reference in Situation, predicted jumping positively with great power. The probability of jumping was. 31, given no social reference, compared to. 93, given social reference. The social reference in the situation was associated with social comparison and social identity as officer cadets. Academy affiliation was the background for further exploration of their social identity. Given participants from the Norwegian Air Force, Navy, Army, and Police Academies, Paper III (N= 128) explores differences between the academies with respect to identity in a given situation. Analysis of each cadet’s reflection process disclosed different identities related to academy affiliation. Navy: Personal –emphasizing rationality and free will. Air Force/Police: Relational – emphasizing the fear of being the only one not jumping. Army: Collective – emphasizing the social identity of being a soldier and a man. The behavioral response mirrored such differences through a range from 43. 2 % at the Naval Academy to 78. 6 % at the Army Academy. Thus, the educational background had an influence with respect to reflection and action in the situation. Examining the influence of social <b>identity,</b> <b>Paper</b> IV (N= 75) tests the effect of an induced social norm on action in the water jump situation. Participants in the experiment were given the offer of jumping within different experimental conditions. The different proportions of jumping between people having no norm induced and those who received an induced anti-jump norm were significant. The simple presence of a peer who modeled the anti-jump position was sufficient to reduce the jump rate from 76 % to 51 %. This demonstrated how the minority influenced the majority. From a psychological perspective, the picture emerging is that uncertain stress situations involve a complex process in which it could be difficult to explore the mechanisms involved. As opposed to the personality tradition, officers seem to enter into a person-situation interaction which predicts action. Moreover, this power of the situation is merely explained by whether social comparison takes place and whether a social identity is taken on. It seems as though people are subject {{to the power of the}} situation and social identity. However, perhaps the most promising finding was that the minority has influence, as the inducement of an anti-jump norm inhibited action. From an educational perspective, the design of the current study could make a contribution to military education. With respect to classroom lecturing, this study argues for a kind of pedagogy that takes place in extreme situations, between a harsh physical environment and social environment. However, the greatest contribution is made by the reflection dialogue that takes place as the situation plays out. In addition to the empirical findings, this reflection process provided knowledge on personal versus social identity to people in the situation. Finally, this thesis argues that the reflection process described in this study has potential for giving insights into a person’s self-regulation in situations of greater importance than the water jump.

This symposium presents recent empirical findings from research projects in four European countries: Spain, Italy, Poland the UK. Respected contributors discuss topical issues in the field such as the link between place {{attachment and}} action; place appropriation; identification with place at different scales and behavioural responses to place-related identity threats, {{using a variety of}} methodological approaches including qualitative and quantitative methods. The result is a symposium that reflects current directions in the field of study and will deepen understandings of place attachment and place <b>identity.</b> <b>Paper</b> 1 : Place inherited or place discovered? On the relationship between different forms of place attachment and place-related action. Author: Maria Lewicka, Faculty of Psychology, University of Warsaw, Poland. Place attachment is usually defined as an emotional bond that people develop with their places (usually places of residence). Despite the apparent commonsense link between this concept and motivation to act on behalf of the place (place attached people should be more willing to be involved in various place-related activities), the empirical evidence for a direct link between attachment and action is usually quite weak and/or the link is mediated by other variables. In this paper I will distinguish between two different forms of place attachment, “place inherited” and “place discovered”, corresponding to D. Hummon's “everyday attachment” and “ideological attachment”, and present data from representative country surveys showing that the two forms of attachment, although correlated, form two qualitatively different ways of relating to a place. Place attachment understood as emotional bonds with place of residence was more strongly related to the concept of “place inherited” than “place discovered”. Of the two forms of attachment only “place discovered” was found to be systematically related to various forms of activity (e. g., membership in local organizations, or participation in actions of protest). A large array of measures, including demographic variables, measures of cultural and social capital, and of accepted values, differentiated the two forms of place attachment. Key words: place attachment, activity, place inherited vs. place discoveredPaper 2 : Malls as a place at Barcelona metropolitan area: Searching for appropriation phenomenaAuthors: Jose V. Pestana, Tomeu Vidal, Nuria Codina, Sergi Valera & Enric Pol (University of Barcelona, Department of Social Psychology, Barcelona, Spain). Malls constitute outstanding elements of the urban landscapes, not only for their presence in the built environment, but also for the human activities they comprise (Chebat, Gelinas-Chebat, & Therrien, 2005). These activities may influence from consumer habits (Green, Cordell, Betz & DiStefano, 2006) to the identifications among people and their environment (Childress, 2004) —what is interesting to the processes of space appropriation (Korosec-Serfaty, 1976, 1984; Moser, Ratiu & Fleury-Bahi, 2002; Pol, 1996; Vidal & Pol, 2005) and time appropriation (Codina, 2007). In this contribution, malls from Barcelona metropolitan area were analyzed through an on-line survey applied to a sample of 417 men and 384 women. Specifically, perceptions about malls, the activities performed in them, and the participants' attendance to other city spaces were studied. Results are discussed from a perspective based on space and time appropriation, as well as the social practices —environmental and culturally situated— that may indicate changes in the urban settings participation. This research has been supported by the Ministry of Education and Science from Spain (general project “Conflictive experiences in public space: New modes of coexistence, uses and opportunities for the participation in urban cohesion” —reference SEJ 2006 - 08975 /PSIC). Paper 3 : Relations between place, landscapes and identity at different scalesFerdinando Fornara*, Renato Troffa°, Marina Mura°*University of Cagliari, Department of Psychology °University of Cagliari, Department of Economic and Social ResearchesLiterature on place identity and related issues has underlined how those places that are considered {{as the basis for the}} development of an identitarian bond may differ in scale (Lewicka, 2008). In the present time, the relationship among sovra-national, national and regional identification deserve to be studied, because of the different level of salience they are acquiring by virtue of the processes of integration and globalization (Martini, Forsthofer, 2000). The present contribution concerns an overview of a cross-cultural research project focusing on the relationship among place, landscape and identity. In particular, the target places are different regions of two EU nations, i. e. Italy and Spain. The main objective of the study was to verify how different landscape prototypes (derived by combining three dimensions in a 2 x 2 x 2 research design, i. e. : built vs. natural, European vs. non-European, Mediterranean vs. non-Mediterranean) can be perceived as sources of identification. Both a survey study (taking into account place identity at different territorial scales, i. e. regional, national, and European) and an experiment (using the Implicit Association test) were carried out. Results showed some differences across regions for as regards the identitarian value of the different territorial scales. Moreover, it emerged how prototypical European as well as natural landscapes are able to elicitate identitarian answers. Practical implications of the study will be discussed. Paper 4 : Identity, traditions and environmental behavior: “Gli sciusci di Gaeta” and “Our lady of the Hens”Caterina Arcidiacono and Fortuna ProcenteseIncoparde(Intercultural, Community, Participation Development) Laboratory, University Federico II, Naples caterina. arcidiacono@unina. itAccording to Mankosky & Rappaport (1995) and Rappaport (2000) local memories, transmitted through art and collective stories of a community, are key elements for the construction of social identity, both individual and collective, connected to specific places. On these basis we investigate whether a rich cultural tradition constitutes an element of social identity and how it influences environmental behaviour. More specifically we examined how the representation of traditions can affect social identity and how the cultural heritage of the town influence environmental behaviour in two local contexts: Pagani (a small town which has many ancient cultural traditions linked to specific locations and their rituals such as the festival of Our Lady of the Hens) and Gaeta(an old historical centre with a very long tradition of collective popular ritual songs “Gli sciusci”). Our contribution tends towards a qualitative approach in examining the data gathered and a participative methodology for examining social identity and the relationship of the inhabitant with ancient towns where history and traditions are still very much alive. Narrative interviews with various protagonists of the local culture (grass-root experts) in both towns, analysed by grounded theory, showed a strong social identity connected to place identity. We explored then the possible actions that could be taken to promote sustainable development and at the same time we focus on how feelings of impotence and social distrust influence relations between citizens and their local environment. Key-words: traditions; place identity; place attachment; environmental behaviour; community trust, agency. Paper 5 : Rethinking NIMBYism: emplacing identities, social representations and valuesDr. Patrick Devine-Wright*Manchester Architecture Research Centre, School of Environment and DevelopmentUniversity of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester M 13 9 PL, UKpdwright@manchester. ac. uk*(from September 1 st, I will take up the position of Professor of Environmental Psychology, School of Geography, University of Exeter, UK) Expanding the generation of energy from renewable sources, in order to counter the threat of climate change, is one of the most formidable challenges facing policymakers. This paper argues that the application of theoretical concepts from environmental and social psychology can help to meet this challenge. To date, the ‘NIMBY' concept (‘Not in my back yard') has been the typical means used by policy makers and industrialists to explain renewable energy opposition, whereby individuals or groups are thought to support renewable energy in principle, yet due to supposed ignorance or selfishness, oppose specific projects in their locality. I propose that so-called ‘NIMBY' behavioural responses (e. g. signing petitions or joining a protest group) arise in contexts where the changes proposed to specific places (e. g. from siting a wind farm) are constructed by local residents as a threat to place-related identity processes. To empirically examine this proposal, public responses to a proposed offshore wind farm in North Wales were investigated, with data collected from residents in two coastal towns using group discussion and survey methods (n = 501). Analysis suggests that opposition was founded in the symbolic contradiction between divergent representations of a scenic, natural and restorative place on the one hand, and a large-scale, industrial technology project on the other, prompting negative emotional responses (anger, anxiety and threat), and protest behaviour. Opposition to the wind farm was more likely in residents with a strong sense of attachment to the locality, who emphasised social values of conservatism over openness to change, and who placed more trust in the local opposition group than the project developer. Implications of the research for theory, policy and practice are discussed. Key words: NIMBYism, renewable energy, place identities, social representations, values...|$|E
