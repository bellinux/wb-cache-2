50|$|The estate's {{specimen}} flourished {{and attracted}} much attention from visitors and the horticultural community. Cuttings were often taken from the tree for propagation throughout the Kingdom. It became so popular that in 1820, the tree was commercially propagated. It is believed that almost all the Irish yew (<b>fastigiated)</b> specimens common in churchyards throughout the world are derived from this one tree.|$|E
50|$|Bark {{included}} branch junctions {{are commonly}} found {{in a wide range}} of tree species, and are considered to occur due to genetic traits in individual trees (e.g. <b>fastigiated),</b> tightly-angled joins and branches competing for light (phototropism). In amenity trees, it is common practice for arborists to prune out young branches with such malformed attachments, subordinate the branch by reducing its length or brace the weakened branch to the rest of the tree, ideally using a flexible brace.|$|E

40|$|Using super-hydrophobic {{butterfly}} wings as templates, {{we developed}} an aqueous sol–gel soakage process assisted by ethanol-wetting {{and followed by}} calcination to fabricate well-organized porous hierarchical SnO 2 with connective hollow interiors and thin mesoporous walls. The exquisite hierarchical architecture of SnO 2 is faithfully replicated from the lightweight skeleton of butterfly wings at the level from nano- to macro-scales. On {{the basis of the}} self-assembly of SnO 2 nanocrystallites with diameter around 7. 0 nm, the interconnected tubes (lamellas), the <b>fastigiated</b> hollow tubers (pillars) and the double-layered substrates further construct the biomorphic hierarchical architecture. Benefiting from the small grain size and the unique hierarchical architecture, the biomorphic SnO 2 as an ethanol sensor exhibits high sensitivity (49. 8 to 50 ppm ethanol), and fast response/recovery time (11 / 31 s to 50 ppm ethanol) even at relatively low working temperature (170 [*]°C) ...|$|E

5000|$|... 'Afghanica' (syn. 'Thevestina'). Most, if not all, {{specimens}} {{of the variety}} 'Afghanica' are of a single clone, and many botanists therefore treat it as a cultivar rather than a botanical variety. It is <b>fastigiate,</b> similar to 'Italica', but with a striking whitish bark; it also differs from 'Italica' in being a female clone. This is the common <b>fastigiate</b> poplar in southwest Asia and southeast Europe (the Balkans), where it was introduced during the Ottoman Empire period.|$|R

6000|$|In {{manner of}} growth, we have weeping or {{pendulous}} varieties of the willow, ash, elm, oak, and yew, and other trees; and this weeping habit is sometimes inherited, {{though in a}} singularly capricious manner. In the Lombardy poplar, and in certain <b>fastigiate</b> or pyramidal varieties of thorns, junipers, oaks, etc., we have an opposite kind of growth. The Hessian oak (10/147. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1842 page 36.), which is famous from its <b>fastigiate</b> habit and size, bears hardly any resemblance in general appearance to a common oak; [...] "its acorns are not sure to produce plants of the same habit; some, however, turn out {{the same as the}} parent-tree." [...] Another <b>fastigiate</b> oak {{is said to have been}} found wild in the Pyrenees, and this is a surprising circumstance; it generally comes so true by seed, that De Candolle considered it as specifically distinct. (10/148. Loudon's 'Arboretum et Fruticetum' volume 3 page 1731.) The <b>fastigiate</b> Juniper (J. suecica) likewise transmits its character by seed. (10/149. Ibid volume 4 page 2489.) Dr. Falconer informs me that in the Botanic Gardens at Calcutta the great heat caused apple-trees to become fastigiate; and we thus see the same result following from the effects of climate and from some unknown cause. (10/150. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 91 describes four varieties of Robinia remarkable from their manner of growth.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{cultivar}} Ulmus glabra ''''Insularis'''', a <b>fastigiate</b> form of Wych Elm, {{was identified}} by Nilsson in Lustgården 30: 127. 1949, as f. insularis. [...] Krüssman {{noted that the}} cultivar arose in Sweden.|$|R
50|$|It is {{occasionally}} {{grown as}} an ornamental tree in northern Europe, primarily for its autumn colour. The cultivar 'Skyline' {{has been selected}} for its <b>fastigiate</b> growth.It may be considerably more invasive than originally thought.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Lobel' is a <b>fastigiate,</b> small-crowned, tree {{not unlike}} the {{pyramidal}} Hornbeam Carpinus betulus 'Fastigiata'. The typically acuminate leaves are < 11 cm long × < 7 cm broad, and notably late to flush, rarely before mid-May.|$|R
5000|$|The vast {{majority}} of the trees in cultivation are selected cultivars with a <b>fastigiate</b> crown, with erect branches forming a narrow to very narrow crown often less than a tenth as wide as the tree is tall. The dark green [...] "exclamation mark" [...] shape of these trees is a highly characteristic signature of Mediterranean town and village landscapes. Formerly, the species was sometimes separated into two varieties, the wild C. sempervirens var. sempervirens (syn. var. horizontalis), and the <b>fastigiate</b> C. s. var. pyramidalis (syn. var. fastigiata, var. stricta), but the latter is now only distinguished as a Cultivar Group, with no botanical significance.|$|R
50|$|Quercus robur 'Fastigiata' ("Cypress Oak"), {{probably}} the most common cultivated form, it grows to a large imposing tree with a narrow columnar habit. The <b>fastigiate</b> oak was originally propagated from an upright tree that was found in central Europe.|$|R
50|$|Carpinus betulus is {{cultivated}} as an ornamental tree, {{for planting}} in gardens and parks. There are several cultivars, notably C. betulus 'Fastigiata' or 'Pyramidalis', a very <b>fastigiate</b> tree when young, {{which has become}} a popular urban street tree in the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|The tree is <b>fastigiate</b> when young, {{but like}} its parent 'Dampieri' can become more {{spreading}} with age. It has broad, crinkled leaves clustered on short shoots; when these are young they are suffused yellow, {{but as the}} tree ages they revert to green.|$|R
5000|$|The Field Elm {{cultivar}} Ulmus minor ''''Viminalis Stricta'''' (:'narrow') {{is probably}} a <b>fastigiate</b> form of Ulmus minor 'Viminalis'. A herbarium specimen at Kew labelled U. campestris var. viminalis f. stricta [...] was considered by Melville a form of his U. × viminalis.|$|R
50|$|Ulmus ''''Clusius'''' is a Dutch hybrid elm {{cultivar}} {{raised at}} Wageningen and released to commerce in 1983. 'Clusius' {{was derived from}} a crossing of the same Dutch clones that produced the <b>fastigiate</b> 'Lobel' released in 1973: '202' ('Exoniensis' × U. wallichiana) and '336' ('Bea Schwarz' selfed).|$|R
5000|$|... 'Rebona' bears a close {{resemblance}} to its sibling 'New Horizon', but requires less maintenance owing {{to a better}} leader. The tree grows rapidly, developing a <b>fastigiate</b> pyramidal shape with ascending branches. The glossy clear-green leaves are comparatively small, though slightly larger than those of 'New Horizon'.|$|R
