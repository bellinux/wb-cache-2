25|$|There {{have been}} at least two glacial periods {{in the history of the}} {{mountains}} and they were glaciated as little as 2,000 years ago. During the Last ice age, the Bale Mountains were one of the most extensively glaciated areas in present day Ethiopia, with a total area of ice in Bale of approximately 180km2. There was a 30km2 ice cap around the peak of Tulu Dimtu (the second highest mountain in Ethiopia) on the Sanetti Plateau and individual glaciers of considerable thickness reached down to 3,200 meters. As a consequence, the landscape as we see it today is the lava outpourings much modified by over 20 million years of <b>erosion</b> <b>by</b> <b>water,</b> wind and ice.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} many {{different}} theories about the formation of Valles Marineris that have changed over the years. [...] Ideas in the 1970s were <b>erosion</b> <b>by</b> <b>water</b> or thermokarst activity, which is the melting of permafrost in glacial climes. Thermokarst activity may contribute, but <b>erosion</b> <b>by</b> <b>water</b> is a problematic mechanism because liquid water cannot exist in most current Martian surface conditions, which typically experience about 1% of Earth’s atmospheric pressure and a temperature range of [...] to [...] Many scientists agree that there was liquid water flowing on the Martian surface in the past. Valles Marineris may have been enlarged by flowing water at this time. Another hypothesis by McCauley in 1972 was that the canyons formed by withdrawal of subsurface magma. Around 1989 Tanaka and Golombek proposed a theory of formation by tensional fracturing. The most agreed upon theory today is that Valles Marineris was formed by rift faults like the East African Rift, later made bigger by erosion and collapsing of the rift walls. It has also been proposed that Valles Marineris was formed by flowing lava.|$|E

2500|$|The {{negative}} effects of fire include hazard to life and property, atmospheric pollution, and water contamination.

50|$|In {{other regions}} of the world (e.g. western Europe), runoff and erosion result from {{relatively}} low intensities of stratiform rainfall falling onto previously saturated soil.

50|$|A {{problem with}} {{defining}} land degradation {{is that what}} one group of people might view as degradation, others might view as a benefit or opportunity.

50|$|In {{some areas}} of the world (e.g. the mid-western USA), {{rainfall}} intensity is the primary determinant of erosivity, with higher intensity rainfall generally resulting in more soil <b>erosion</b> <b>by</b> <b>water.</b> The size and velocity of rain drops is also an important factor. Larger and higher-velocity rain drops have greater kinetic energy, and thus their impact will displace soil particles by larger distances than smaller, slower-moving rain drops.|$|E
