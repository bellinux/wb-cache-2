40|$|Depending on process conditions, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and {{polychlorinated dibenzofurans}} (PCDFs) may be {{generated}} as low-level byproducts of chlorophenol and chlorophenoxy herbicides manufacture. A {{stratified random sample}} of 20 active employees from a cohort of phenoxy herbicide workers was selected in 1995 for determining PCDD and PCDF congeners in blood lipids to assess the extent of past PCDD and PCDF exposure in this cohort and whether that exposure might explain site-specific cancer findings in the total cohort. This cohort {{is included in the}} IARC International Registry of Persons Exposed to Phenoxyacid Herbicides and Their Contaminants. For the 19 persons who participated, median PCDD and PCDF concentrations were comparable to background concentrations in the general population. Median levels of 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, the sum of <b>hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin,</b> pentachlorodibenzofurans, and two dioxin toxicity equivalents values were statistically higher in 7 employees assigned to synthesis operations than for 12 employees assigned to other operations. However, the PCDD and PCDF concentrations were low relative to those seen in other dioxinexposed cohorts. We conclude that PCDD and PCDF exposures of cohort members are unlikely to explain the elevated standardized mortality ratios observed in this cohort for several cancer sites.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To find whether {{concentrations}} of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in serum increased in workers at municipal incinerators that burn continuously.  METHODS— 30 Workers employed at three municipal {{waste incineration plants}} (incinerator workers) and 30  control workers were studied. The incinerator workers had worn dust masks or airline masks during the periodic repair work inside the incinerators. Previous job, dietary habit, smoking habit, distance from residence to the incineration plant, and body weight and height were obtained from a questionnaire survey. Concentrations of PCDDs/PCDFs were measured in the serum of the workers and the dust deposited in the plants. The influence of various factors on serum {{concentrations of}} PCDDs/PCDFs was examined by multiple regression analysis.  RESULTS—Dust analysis showed {{the greatest amount of}} octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD), followed by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HpCDD), 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -heptachlorodibenzofuran (HpCDF), and octachlorodibenzofuran (OCDF). The toxicity equivalents (TEQs) of PCDDs and PCDFs in the deposited dust were 4. 8,  1. 0, and 6. 4  ng TEQs/g, respectively, for plants A, B, and C.  The mean serum TEQs of PCDDs and PCDFs in the incinerator workers and control workers were 19. 2  and 22. 9  pg TEQs/g lipid, respectively, for area A, 28. 8  and 24. 5  pg TEQs/g lipid for area B, and 23. 4  and 23. 6  pg TEQs/g lipid for area C.  No {{significant differences were found between}} the incinerator workers and the controls for TEQs of PCDDs and PCDFs separately, and TEQs of PCDDs and PCDFs together. However, the serum 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -HpCDF concentration was significantly higher in the incinerator workers than in the controls for all the three areas. When the exposure index to 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -HpCDF is defined as the product of the concentration of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -HpCDF in the deposited dust and duration of employment, the concentration of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -HpCDF in serum increased as the exposure index increased. Multivariate analysis suggested that the serum concentration of HpCDF increased with duration of employment at the incineration plants and OCDF increased with employment of ⩾ 21 years. The other significant variables (p< 0. 01 or p< 0. 001) were area for <b>hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin</b> (HxCDD) and tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF), Brinkman index for HpCDD, and body mass index (BMI) for tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), HpCDD, and TEQs of PCDDs.  CONCLUSION—The serum TEQs of PCDDs and PCDFs was not significantly higher among the incinerator workers, but the serum concentration of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -HpCDF was. This suggests that the incinerator workers had inhaled dust containing PCDDs and PCDFs while working in plants equipped with incinerators that burn continuously.    Keywords: serum dioxins; municipal waste incinerators; continuous burning; heptachlorodibenzofura...|$|E
