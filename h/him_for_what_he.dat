25|$|In New York Harbor, filmmaker Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), {{famous for}} making {{wildlife}} films in remote and exotic locations, charters Captain Englehorn's (Frank Reicher) ship Venture {{for his new}} project, but is unable to secure an actress for a female role he has reluctantly added to the script. Due to set sail that night, Denham searches the streets of New York for a suitable woman. He meets penniless Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) and convinces her to join <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> proposes as the adventure of a lifetime.

25|$|When Henry {{tried to}} divorce Queen Catherine of Aragon, Fisher became the Queen's chief supporter. As such, he {{appeared}} on the Queen's behalf in the legates' court, where he startled the audience by the directness of his language and by declaring that, like St John the Baptist, {{he was ready to}} die on behalf of the indissolubility of marriage. Henry VIII, upon hearing this, grew so enraged by it that he composed a long Latin address to the legates in answer to the bishop's speech. Fisher's copy of this still exists, with his manuscript annotations in the margin which show how little he feared the royal anger. The removal of the cause to Rome brought Fisher's personal involvement to an end, but the King never forgave <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had done.|$|E
25|$|It transpires that Husk's {{personality}} {{shifts and}} subsequent mental breakdown and betrayal where {{caused by a}} secondary mutation which means her powers now also affect her mind {{as well as her}} body. Husk is forgiven for her betrayal since she was of unsound mind and is made the Academy's new guidance counselor, however Toad is fired. As he is leaving Husk apologizes to him for being unable to remember what happened between them, he claims he knew it was too good to last. Before he leaves she arranges a date at a local coffee shop, but the city is attacked by self-replicating energy bots built by Maximilian Frankenstein so he and Manuel Endque could escape the Grey Academy. The X-Men defeat the robots, and half the coffee shop has been destroyed. Endque was found by the X-Men having been severely beaten by Toad on Frankenstein's orders, Toad seemingly now working for Frankenstein, wanting to go someplace nobody can hurt them. Endque passes on a message to Husk that Toad left because he knew even if things went well between them one day she'd wake up and see <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> really was. Husk breaks down in tears.|$|E

500|$|Billy Childish wrote a song {{entitled}} [...] "Louis Riel", {{which was}} performed by Thee Headcoats. Texas musician Doug Sahm wrote a song entitled [...] "Louis Riel," [...] which appeared on the album S.D.Q. '98. In the song, Sahm likens the lore surrounding Riel to David Crockett's legend in his home state, spinning an abridged tale of Riel's life as a revolutionary: [...] "...but you gotta respect <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought was right... And all around Regina they talk about him still – why {{did they have to}} kill Louis Riel?" ...|$|E

As Neku walks from Udagawa to Hachiko to meet Beat, Rhyme, and Shiki, he {{discusses}} how {{the past three weeks}} have changed him for the better. In a statement directed at an absent Joshua, Neku says that although he will not forgive <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has done, he trusts him. Neku then asks if Joshua will be present at Hachiko as well. Secret reports that can be obtained by completing additional missions after beating the game reveal that Joshua, after seeing the change in personality of Neku over the weeks of playing the game, decides to spare Shibuya, now believing the city to be ideal. The game ends with Neku abandoning his headphones, before a title card appears entitled [...] "The World Begins with You".|$|E
500|$|During {{the final}} years of the Clinton administration, Moran was {{critical}} of the President: In 1998, during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Moran was one of only 31 House Democrats to support launching a formal impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton. He told Time magazine that [...] "This whole sordid mess is just too tawdry and tedious and embarrassing ... It's like a novel that just became too full of juicy parts and bizarre, sleazy characters." [...] Moran is also reported to have told First Lady Hillary Clinton that if she had been his sister, he would have punched her husband in the nose. Moran eventually decided not to vote for impeachment, explaining that Clinton had not compromised the country's security, and that he still respected <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had accomplished as President. Moran proposed a resolution demanding that Clinton confess to a pattern of [...] "dishonest and illegal conduct" [...] surrounding his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.|$|E

500|$|Psycho-Pass further {{suggests}} {{that the price of}} living without stress includes overriding the individual's needs in favor of general social value. It is morally and socially acceptable to kill individuals who may potentially commit crimes, so long as we accept that the harm that a criminal causes to society outweighs the harm we cause to an individual who is falsely charged. In other words, the Sibyl System operates on the principles of opportunity cost and acceptable risk. But relying on the Sibyl System paradoxically creates a society which fears no crime as a whole, but individuals who personally fear the consequences of the Sibyl System's verdicts. As such, Urobuchi himself has said that one of the series' central thematic ideas is [...] "fear" [...] as seen through Shogo Makishima's feeling of being out of place - because the Sibyl System cannot recognize <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> actually is, he feels displaced and deviant within the structure of society itself.|$|E
500|$|One day, Vivien hears {{crying in}} the {{basement}} and goes down to investigate where she finds an exhausted and stressed Nora (Lily Rabe), taking care of a baby. Vivien approaches a confused Nora who mistakes her for a nanny and demands she be called Mrs. Montgomery. Vivien complies and Nora confesses the baby took one breath before dying, thus keeping the baby's ghost in the house. Nora recognizes Vivien and insults her for having a baby that won't stop crying to which Vivien defends the baby. Vivien asks for permission to hold him, to which Nora angrily refuses and proclaims the baby as hers as arrangements were made with which Vivien regretfully complies. Vivien offers help in calming her still crying son to which Nora finally agrees. Vivien calms her child almost immediately, Nora confesses she does not have the constitution to be a caring mother and she wanted to hurt the baby and leaves the baby to Vivien to get a [...] "good rest". Finally free of anyone trying to claim her child, [...] Vivien asks Moira to join their family as the baby's godmother, which she happily accepts. Vivien names their baby Jeffrey. Together, as one happy family, they all celebrate Christmas by decorating a tree in the abandoned house with various ornaments found in the attic. Watching from outside, Hayden tells Tate that Violet will never forgive <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did and that he should get over her, but he resolves to wait for her [...] "forever".|$|E

Don't expect the next modern manga masterpiece." [...] Katherine Dacey, writing for The Manga Critic, criticises Misao for not defending herself even as [...] "demons slash her throat, poison her, push her off rooftops, and slam her against walls." [...] Dacey comments that [...] "younger readers may find [...] sexy, but older readers will see <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is: a wolf in knight’s clothing, posing as Misao’s savior while manipulating her for his own selfish interests." ...|$|E

The killer is sentenced to the same [...] "death of personality" [...] {{punishment}} as his victim. The sentence is carried out and, in a twist of reconciliation, the killer is welcomed into the Order by Brother Theo as Brother Malcolm. Theo is willing to forgive <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> done and challenges Sheridan that forgiveness, while a hard thing, is always something worth striving for. After first being enraged at seeing the [...] "new" [...] Brother Malcolm, Sheridan grudgingly sees the wisdom in Theo's words and wishes Brother Malcolm well.|$|R

2500|$|Thom Jurek {{wrote about}} him after his death, [...] "Willy DeVille is America's loss even if America doesn’t know it yet. The reason is simple: Like {{the very best}} rock and roll writers and {{performers}} in our history, he’s {{one of the very}} few who got it right; he understood what made a three-minute song great, and why it matteredbecause it mattered to him. He lived and died with the audience in his shows, and he gave them something to remember when they left the theater, because he meant every single word of every song as he performed it. Europeans like that. In this jingoistic age of American pride, perhaps we can revisit our own true love of rock and roll by discovering Willy DeVille for the first timeor, at the very least, remember <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> really was: an American original. The mythos and pathos in his songs, his voice, and his performances were born in these streets and cities and then given to the world who appreciated him much more than we did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rebellion {{against an}} {{authority}} seen as unfair is woven throughout the story. Established institutions {{are seen as}} inhumane or selfish, and therefore fallible (Stoneman, 1987); Mr. Hale breaks with the church on a matter of conscience, and Frederick Hale participates in a mutiny against the navy and is forced into exile because the law would hang <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> considered a just cause. His rebellion parallels the strike by workers who take up the cause to feed their children (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 17). Both are impotent and engaged in a struggle (a war, {{in the eyes of}} the workers) whose terms are dictated by those who maintain their power by force: the law and the mill masters (Stoneman, 1987, pp 122–126). Margaret rebels in ways which express her liberty: ignoring social proprieties and challenging authority by lying to the police to protect her brother, from whom she learns that arbitrary, unjust and cruel power can be defied not for oneself but on behalf of the unfortunate. Even Mrs. Hale rebels in her own way; she is [...] "prouder of Frederick standing up against injustice, than if he had been simply a good officer" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 14).|$|E
2500|$|In February 2011, Susan Hill {{from the}} Daily Star {{reported}} that Lynsey {{would become the}} next target of serial killer Silas Blissett. Hassan revealed that executive producer Paul Marquess brought her into his office {{to tell her that}} she would be involved in a [...] "really big storyline", which he outlined to her, leaving her really excited. The storyline began when Lynsey angered Silas, who then attacked her. Silas was scared off after Lynsey's screams alerted his grandson Riley Costello (Rob Norbury) to the situation. Hassan thought Lynsey's [...] "steeliness" [...] helped her break free from Silas. Lynsey realised Silas was the one who attacked her, after she heard his voice which [...] "triggers a flashback" [...] to the moment of the attack. Hassan added that when nobody believed Lynsey, it [...] "makes her want to bring Silas down even more. She's determined to find the evidence she needs to expose <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is". Waugh, who plays Lynsey's best friend Cheryl, explained that everyone believes that Lynsey is crazy and has made up the allegations. Lynsey then turns to Cheryl for help and although she hates seeing her best friend in such a state, Cheryl believed Lynsey was just being paranoid.|$|E

Outside the hotel, Gilcrest finds Ng, who is preparing to leave. He tells her he loves her, is staying in Hawaii and will be waiting for her to return. Later that night, Gilcrest stands outside Grace's hula class and watches her dance. She notices him, he nods at her and she suddenly realizes he is her father. With tears of joy in her eyes, she runs outside and embraces him then returns to her class to continue her hula dancing.|$|R

2500|$|According to Theodoret, {{when the}} emperor tried {{to enter a}} Milanese church, where Ambrose was about to {{celebrate}} a mass, the bishop stopped him and rebuked <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had done. And because the emperor “had been brought up according to divine words and understood well that some affairs are handled by priests, others by emperors”, he could do nothing but return [...] "weeping and sighing" [...] to the palace. Eight months had passed and Theodosius still sat in the palace, moaning and sobbing. His magister officiorum Rufinus, who [...] "used great freedom of speech due to the familiarity with the emperor", noticed this behaviour, approached and {{asked him why he}} was weeping. Having been told, he volunteered to see the bishop and ask him to reconsider. Theodosius hesitantly agreed and even chose to follow Rufinus from a distance. Ambrose was not restrained at all when negotiating with Rufinus, scolding him and even accusing him of complicity in the massacre: [...] "Rufinus, you are as impudent as a dog, because it was you who advised the emperor such a bloodshed." [...] When the emperor showed up, Ambrose at first remained stubborn and changed his mind only after Theodosius promised to promulgate a law, which in cases of death sentences would introduce a thirty-day lag before the execution.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1858, Li was reassigned to serve in Zeng Guofan's office, where {{he was in charge}} of {{drafting}} documents. Li led a carefree life, flouted rules and regulations, and often woke up late. Zeng Guofan once chided him, [...] "Shaoquan, now that you're working in my office, I only have this piece of advice for you: 'Commitment' is the only thing that matters to us here." [...] Li was shocked and he improved his behaviour after that. In the same year, Weng Tongshu (翁同書), the xunfu of Anhui, abandoned his post when he came under attack by the Taiping rebels. Zeng Guofan drew from Li's draft when he wrote a memorial to the imperial court to accuse Weng Tongshu of failing in his duty. The lines from Li's draft that were included in Zeng Guofan's actual memorial included: [...] "It is my duty, as Your Majesty's subject, [...] I do not dare to let this pass just because of Weng Tonghe's fame and prestige." [...] Although Li earned Zeng Guofan's praise for drafting the memorial, he also caused Weng Tonghe (Weng Tongshu's brother) to bear a grudge against <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wrote. While serving under Zeng Guofan, he was put in charge of Yanjianshao Circuit (延建邵道) in Fujian Province but did not take up his appointment and remained with Zeng.|$|E
2500|$|In Britain, where Henry {{had spent}} much of his club career, The Suns {{headline}} was [...] "Le Hand of God: Cheat Theirry Does A Maradona.", while The Daily Mirror was [...] "French Nickers.", with The Independent using [...] "Hand Gaul!". The Los Angeles Times speculated the incident had the potential to ruin his reputation with a moment of [...] "eternal notoriety". The Guardian's chief sportswriter Richard Williams wrote that the incident was worse than Maradona's foul, describing his handball as [...] "a street kid's instinct", while Henry's was [...] "a sophisticated man, and a much-decorated one." [...] Williams also critiqued Henry's decision not to inform the referee, citing previous club football examples of players not taking advantage of a referee's mistake: Robbie Fowler in 1997 unsuccessfully pleading for the referee not to give a penalty in his favour, Paolo Di Canio in 2000 catching the ball rather than scoring past an incapacitated goalkeeper, and Costin Lazăr in 2009 successfully insisting he would not take the penalty awarded to <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw as a fair challenge. Henri Astier wrote for BBC News that the reaction in France, a [...] "nation not particularly known for its moral qualms", had ranged from [...] "embarrassment to outrage". Dominic Lawson wrote in The Sunday Times that [...] " [...] has taken on the role of unjustly oppressed victim – something the Irish do well, having had several centuries of practice".|$|E
