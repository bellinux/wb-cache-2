5|$|From November 1984 to June 1987 the DeKalb County Courthouse {{underwent}} {{an interior}} restoration, which {{was completed in}} time for the sesquicentennial celebration for DeKalb County. The restoration, at an approximate cost of $100,000, was undertaken by Conrad Schmitt Studios of New Berlin, Wisconsin. The modern front doors to the courthouse hide the original, beveled <b>glass</b> <b>front</b> doors from view. Once inside the modern doors, the nonfunctional original doors can be seen, standing wide open, to be admired; each door weighs several hundred pounds. Past the doors, in the building's main lobby, is the large, marble staircase to the second floor. The staircase, as well as the lobby's wainscoting, is done in gray Tennessee marble. Most of the first floor is original to the building, including the hexagonal marble flooring, stained glass windows and two original, first floor courtrooms. The plasterwork along the walls and ceilings of the lobby is ornately decorated.|$|E
5|$|The American Air Museum {{was opened}} by Queen Elizabeth II on 1 August 1997. The {{total cost of}} the project had been £13.5 million. The museum was re-dedicated on 27 September 2002, in a {{ceremony}} attended by former President George H. W. Bush and by Prince Charles. Since being opened, the museum has had its <b>glass</b> <b>front</b> removed, and then reinstalled, to allow the bringing-in of an SR-71 Blackbird and Consolidated B-24 Liberator. The SR-71, serial number 61-7962, is the only example of its type on display outside the United States, and set a flight altitude record of 85,069 feet (25,929m) in July 1976. Besides the Blackbird, nineteen other American aircraft are on display. Notable examples include a C-47 Skytrain which flew with the 316th Troop Carrier Group and participated in three major Second World War airborne operations; the June 1944 Normandy landings, Operation Market Garden and Operation Varsity, the airborne crossing of the River Rhine in March 1945. The museum's B-29 flew during the Korean War as part of the 7th Bomb Wing; it is the only example in Europe and one of only two preserved in museums outside the United States. The B-52 flew 200 sorties during the Vietnam War as part of the 28th Bomb Wing. The General Dynamics F-111 on display flew 19 missions during the 1991 Gulf War as part of the 77th Fighter Squadron.|$|E

25|$|In the Victorian {{era in the}} United Kingdom, {{a common}} design for the home {{aquarium}} was a <b>glass</b> <b>front</b> with the other sides made of wood (made watertight with a pitch coating). The bottom would be made of slate and heated from below. More advanced systems soon began to be introduced, along with tanks of glass in metal frames. During {{the latter half of}} the 19th century, a variety of aquarium designs were explored, such as hanging the aquarium on a wall, mounting it as part of a window, or even combining it with a birdcage.|$|E
25|$|In September 2013, Khan stated {{his plans}} to 'make Bolton better', by doing so, he would invest £5 million into a wedding and banqueting hall in Washington Street, Deane. This would also help create up to 125 jobs in the local area. Original plans were {{for it to be}} ready within 18 months, with an all <b>glass</b> <b>front.</b> On 23 November, 2016 Khan made an {{announcement}} of the other businesses that would open alongside the banqueting hall, This included FMK make-up shop, to be run by his wife Faryal, Argeela Lounge, which is a shisha bar and restaurant, popular British-Asian curry firm My Lahore, another buffet restaurant and coffee shop.|$|E

500|$|The {{design of}} the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus is {{influenced}} by that of the iPad Air with a <b>glass</b> <b>front</b> that is curved {{around the edges of}} the display, and an aluminum rear that contains two plastic strips for the antenna. Both models come in gold, silver, and [...] "space gray" [...] finishes. The iPhone 6 has a thickness of , while the iPhone 6 Plus is [...] in thickness; both are thinner than the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s, with the iPhone 6 being Apple's thinnest phone to date. The most significant changes to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are its displays; both branded as [...] "Retina HD Display" [...] and [...] "ion-strengthened", the iPhone 6 display is 4.7 inches in size with a [...] resolution of 1334x750 (326ppi, minus one row of pixels), while the iPhone 6 Plus includes a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 (1080p) display (401PPI). The displays use a multiple-domain LCD panel, dubbed [...] "dual-domain pixels"; the RGB pixels themselves are skewed in pattern, so that every pixel is seen from a different angle. This technique helps improve the viewing angles of the display.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s the {{grandstand}} received a <b>glass</b> <b>front</b> {{to accommodate a}} restaurant and offered 14 buffet bars and 10 licensed bars. Such was Harringay's reputation that in the 1950s Sporting Life called the track [...] "the best running circuit in Britain". In 1959 the Oaks was switched to Harringay from White City.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, at {{approximately}} 4:15–4:20 pm, {{a group of}} people approached the Pay-Less Liquor and Deli on Florence Avenue just west of Normandie. A gang member in an interview explains that the group [...] "just decided they weren’t going to pay for what they were getting." [...] The store owner's son was hit with a bottle of beer, and two other youths smashed the <b>glass</b> <b>front</b> door of the store. Two officers from the 77th Street Division of the LAPD responded to this incident and, finding that the instigators had already left, completed a report.|$|E

2500|$|The {{interior}} {{has been}} described as [...] "cathedral-like", [...] "lofty [...] noble". Comparisons have been made between it and the mid 19th-century works of French architect Henri Labrouste, such as the Sainte-Geneviève Library and the Bibliothèque nationale de France, and also the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. The two-storey forum-style space is interspersed with large white-painted concrete columns splayed at the top. Natural light comes in through the south-facing <b>glass</b> <b>front</b> and is directed by a giant screen {{in the form of a}} louvre which, along with steel and glass passageways, divide the outer glass wall from the interior. These passages form a -shaped surround at first-floor level, behind which are staff rooms, stock rooms, conference facilities and other administrative functions. [...] They are partly lined with beech panels.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1912, {{the vast}} number of imitators {{prompted}} Houdini to replace his milk can act with the Chinese water torture cell. In this escape, Houdini's feet were locked in stocks, and he was lowered upside down into a tank filled with water. The mahogany and metal cell featured a <b>glass</b> <b>front,</b> through which audiences could clearly see Houdini. The stocks were locked {{to the top of}} the cell, and a curtain concealed his escape. In the earliest version of the torture cell, a metal cage was lowered into the cell, and Houdini was enclosed inside that. While making the escape more difficult – the cage prevented Houdini from turning – the cage bars also offered protection should the front glass break. The original cell was built in England, where Houdini first performed the escape for an audience of one person as part of a one-act play he called [...] "Houdini Upside Down". This was so he could copyright the effect and have grounds to sue imitators, which he did. While the escape was advertised as [...] "The Chinese Water Torture Cell" [...] or [...] "The Water Torture Cell", Houdini always referred to it as [...] "the Upside Down" [...] or [...] "USD". The first public performance of the USD was at the Circus Busch in Berlin, on September 21, 1912. Houdini continued to perform the escape until his death in 1926.|$|E
60|$|He {{lifted his}} rather heavy eyelids, which fluttered in {{considerable}} embarrassment. Then his dubious eye roamed {{again to the}} white lettering on the <b>glass</b> <b>front</b> of the public-house. The young woman's eyes followed his, and rested there also, but in pure puzzledom.|$|E
5000|$|Stringent {{precautions}} {{were taken}} to prevent accidental detonation in the cartridge stores. These included [...] "spark free" [...] copper fittings, rope shoes and the obvious measure of lighting magazines through plate <b>glass</b> <b>fronted</b> passages or niches.|$|R

60|$|It was a wet {{night and}} the streets seemed like a perfect sea of umbrellas. The rain was coming down in sheets, beating against the closed <b>glass</b> <b>front</b> of our cab and dimming its surface, until it became {{impossible}} to see farther than the horse's head. I leaned back by Mr. Marx's side with a sigh, and found {{that he had been}} watching me with an amused smile.|$|E
60|$|A {{man came}} up the road between the pines. It {{was a relief to}} see one man instead of a party, but she went to the <b>glass</b> <b>front</b> and watched him with keen curiosity. He {{vanished}} among the trees where the road curved and when he came out not far off she set her lips. It was Walters and her vague fears were realized, but he would not reach the hotel {{for a few minutes and}} this gave her time to brace herself.|$|E
60|$|When {{it began}} to get dark, she stood near the <b>glass</b> <b>front</b> of the veranda and glanced at her watch. She could see for some {{distance}} down the valley and knew that the smoke of a locomotive would spread in a dark cloud across {{the tops of the}} pines. The train was late, but there was no smoke yet. It was a long climb from sea-level at Vancouver Inlet and in winter the line was sometimes blocked. There was no obvious ground for alarm, but somehow she was worse afraid of Walters than before.|$|E
50|$|Transient {{modelling}} is {{the basis}} of weather forecasting, of managing ecosystems, rail timetabling, managing the electricity grid, setting the national budget, floating currency, understanding traffic flows on a freeway, solar gains on <b>glass</b> <b>fronted</b> buildings, or even of checking the day-to-day transactions of one's monthly bank statement.|$|R

60|$|The diligences in France {{are very}} large, and {{are divided into}} {{different}} compartments, with a different price for each. There are usually three compartments below and one above. In the Italian diligences, however, {{or at least in}} the one in which Mr. George and Rollo travelled to Rome, there were only three. First there was the interior, or the body of the coach proper. Directly before this was a compartment, with a <b>glass</b> <b>front,</b> containing one seat only, which looked forward; there were, of course, places for three persons on this seat. This front compartment is called the coupé.[1] It is considered the best in the diligence.|$|E
60|$|Once more {{he put out}} {{his hand}} frankly to poor Flora; once more poor Flora couldn't accept it frankly, found it worth nothing openly, must make the old intrigue and mystery of it. As much to her own {{enjoyment}} as to his dismay, she covered it with a corner of her shawl as she took it. Then, looking towards the <b>glass</b> <b>front</b> of the counting-house, and seeing two figures approaching, she cried with infinite relish, 'Papa! Hush, Arthur, for Mercy's sake!' and tottered back to her chair with an amazing imitation of being in danger of swooning, in the dread surprise and maidenly flutter of her spirits.|$|E
60|$|Then we {{proceeded}} to the Lunatic Asylum, {{to which we}} were admitted by a porter at the gate. Within doors we found some neat and comely servant-women, one of whom showed us into a handsome parlor, and took my card to the Governor. There was a large bookcase, with a <b>glass</b> <b>front,</b> containing handsomely bound books, many of which, I observed, were of a religious character. In {{a few minutes the}} Governor came in, a middle-aged man, tall, and thin for an Englishman, kindly and agreeable enough in aspect, but not with the marked look of a man of force and ability. I should not judge from his conversation that he was an educated man, or that he had any scientific acquaintance with the subject of insanity.|$|E
