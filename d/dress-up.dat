500|$|The use of {{the wedding}} {{industry}} is, per Snodgrass, [...] "a wry reprise of Roberts' career in fictional matchmaking". [...] The novel celebrates the joy of a traditional wedding ceremony, including the playful ceremonies arranged by children playing <b>dress-up.</b> [...] Roberts' treatment of these themes [...] "validates the <b>dress-up</b> game of playing bride as both fantasy and a stabilizing preface on women's devotion to mate and family". [...] Roberts included significant detail on the wedding planning industry, which Snodgrass posits is meant to highlight and celebrate the success the female characters had at niche marketing.|$|E
500|$|Mileena is {{featured}} in the 1995 collectible card game Mortal Kombat Kard Game, {{as well as in}} the 2006 crossover collectible card game Epic Battles where she is one of the characters representing the Mortal Kombat universe that were featured already in the Premiere Edition. Io9's Charlie Jane Anders included Mileena <b>dress-up</b> apparel among 2011's [...] "sluttiest and weirdest" [...] store-bought Halloween costumes, but Justin Amirikhani of Complex praised it as one of [...] "last-minute video game costumes that actually look cool" [...] and Brian Altano of IGN included it among [...] "ten ridiculous (or ridiculously sexy) video game inspired Halloween costumes" [...] of 2012.|$|E
500|$|During the {{pre-production}} for the episode, {{the cast}} and crew realized that the Halloween conceit would allow the various cast members to wear costumes, rather than their [...] "usual, realistically plain suits". B. J. Novak called the <b>dress-up</b> experience [...] "fun", noting that [...] "seeing the most serious of our plotlines play out alongside such silly and bizarre visuals was, I think, one of the most inspired ideas of the episode's writer, Greg Daniels." [...] The idea for Pam to be dressed as a cat was inspired by several unused stories, created by Gene Stupnitsky, in which [...] "Pam Beesley must disguise herself as a cat". The plot lines were vetoed by the shows writers, but Stupnitsky successfully petitioned to allow Pam to wear a cat costume.|$|E
500|$|The film drew {{a number}} of {{negative}} reactions from the film critics. Subhra Gupta gave the film a half-star out of five in The Indian Express, saying [...] "After all the shoot-outs and bang-bangs are over, you are left with a film which leaves you with so little new that you wonder if there's any juice left in this style of retro gangsta flick. Or are we heading for a third-time-in-Mumbai-Tibara?" [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 1.5 out of five stars, describing the film as the [...] "equivalent of getting a root canal". He criticised the naivety of the three leads: Kumar for his [...] "in-your-face flamboyance", Khan for playing an [...] "urban rich kid slumming it out at a <b>dress-up</b> party" [...] and both for [...] "rat-a-tat punch lines", but praised Sonali Bendre's cameo as Mumtaz. Mohar Basu gave the film two out of five stars in Koimoi, criticising the melodrama and the [...] "lacklustre chemistry", remarking that the film [...] "lacks the effervescence and naturalness of its prequel".|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the single}} was shot on March 15, 2010 in the deserts of Lancaster, California, {{directed}} by Hype Williams. When talking to 'MTV News' about the video Minaj stated, [...] "I didn't want to shoot the typical new-artist vision. Thank God I have a wonderful label that stands behind me and my vision. I met Hype in a freakin' airport...and {{it happened to be}} a week before I wanted to shoot a video. I told him the idea. Of course, I had to let Baby and Slim know and hope they would understand my expensive taste. It all came together." [...] It's just beautiful — the clothes, everything. The ambiance..It's for all the girls that like to play <b>dress-up.</b> They're gonna love this one...we get on the walkie-talkie, like, 'Mayday! Mayday!' It's really fashion and beauty shots, and we're acting like we're doing something important. We wanted to make it pretty in the dirt. We wanted to have a very crazy contrast. I didn't want to do everything clean. I like the dirt. All that pink stuff looks even prettier in the dirt." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Wild and the Innocent" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B-, {{noting that he}} was unsure whether it was [...] "one of the series' very best episodes or one of its very worst". VanDerWerff praised McComb's performance, but felt that Donovan was [...] "a kid playing <b>dress-up</b> as the bad guy"; he also noted the episode's similarity to the works of Flannery O'Connor, and described it as [...] "nicely baroque, filled with lots of nice little moments and characters along the way". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 1 out of 5, describing it as [...] "irritating, poorly cast and terribly written". Gibron felt that the episode's setting [...] "reduces Millennium to a ridiculous movie of the week", adding that the voice-over narration makes it [...] "a chore to sit through". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five, describing it as [...] "a quirky failure". Shearman and Pearson felt that [...] "The Wild and the Innocent" [...] was a [...] "curious mix of the cloyingly sentimental and the unremittingly bleak", finding similarities to the works of Cormac McCarthy; however, they felt {{that it did not}} work well as an episode of Millennium, finding the minimal involvement of the series' main characters and the distinct difference in setting to detract from the episode as a whole.|$|E
500|$|Laura Fissinger from South Florida Sun-Sentinel {{felt that}} [...] "'Virgin Tour' {{establishes}} Madonna {{more as a}} bimbo, rather than the strong, independent woman people think her to be." [...] David O'Reilly from Philadelphia Daily News said that with the concert [...] "Madonna proved once more why she was called a 'talentless bimbo'; it was utter trash." [...] Richard Defendorf of Orlando Sentinel gave a positive review, saying [...] "Madonna's 'Virgin Tour' was very enjoyable and she put her music video charms in her live performances." [...] Maya Hathoray from The Miami Herald said that [...] "We know [...] sexy, exotically beautiful and her funk/pop songs make us want to dance, but on stage, she is extremely tame compared to her raw persona in her music videos. She is like daddy's little girl." [...] Mary Edgar Smith from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution observed that [...] "It was obvious from the apparel of the young girls at last week's Virgin Tour concerts in Tampa and Orlando, Fla., that the 26-year-old singer [...] had more {{to give to the}} music world than what others suggest. She will be {{a force to be reckoned}} with." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times commented, [...] "While her pubescent lookalike fans cheer approvingly, the star's manipulation of such symbols as a wedding gown, a cross, furs and jewels becomes a lighthearted communal psychodrama. Madonna has brought traditional little girl's games of <b>dress-up</b> and playing with dolls (using oneself as model) into the television age by turning them into a public spectacle." [...] A review in Variety by John Gleeson said that [...] "Madonna's singing was like a soundtrack to a more visceral display of herself, her persona, her nonstop dancing and her surprisingly explicit sexual dare, which included a visual climax—so to speak—to every other song." [...] Paul Grein from Billboard said that [...] "Madonna's show was stylish, well-paced and consistently entertaining." ...|$|E
2500|$|In this children's spoof show on CBBC, three {{sketches}} spoofing Doctor Who are shown. The first {{begins with}} the Doctor and Rose {{stepping out of the}} TARDIS into a darkened room. The Doctor, using his Sonic Screwdriver as a torch, reveals several aliens who are all blasted by Rose's ray gun. The Doctor then turns on the light and sees that they have materialised at a child <b>dress-up</b> party. The child then comes in. The Doctor and Rose wish him a happy birthday. He calls them to get a doctor. [...] "Funny you should say that" [...] says the Doctor.|$|E
2500|$|For 1971, the SS option {{could be}} ordered with any {{optional}} V8 and became {{more of a}} <b>dress-up</b> option than a performance option. The SS option was reduced to one RPO code, RPO Z15, and was only available for the Chevelle Malibu. [...] This RPO code required any optional engine and transmission available in the Chevelle lineup. [...] Since the 307 V8 was the standard base V8 in 1971, {{it could not be}} ordered with the SS option; one had to order the LS3 402 or the LS5 454, or one of the two 350 V8 engines (L65 or L48 - which reintroduced the small block to the SS option {{for the first time since}} the 1965 model year for USA market Chevelles).|$|E
2500|$|She {{was educated}} in the liberal arts and learned Latin, Italian, and {{geography}} at Mrs. Draper's School for girls located in Park Street, Westminster between 1719 and 1721 and then moved {{to live with her}} mother in Middlesex. [...] She suggested that her gender identification with men showed up early in her life, as she recalled impersonating her father as a small child, and, when she moved in with her mother, she taught herself shooting, gardening, and horse racing, but this may also be normal <b>dress-up</b> for a child, and especially one with a famous father. [...] In 1724, she and her mother moved to Hertfordshire, and there she continued engaging in country sports and education, focusing on subjects and pursuits usually associated with males. [...] According to her anecdotes, she also [...] "studied medicine" [...] there and, in 1726, tried to set herself up as a doctor (she was thirteen years old). [...] This only lasted several years because when she hit the age of sixteen she moved back home with her father.|$|E
2500|$|An SS option {{remained}} available, but it {{was merely}} a $123 <b>dress-up</b> package that included a blackout grille and Rally wheels. It could be ordered {{with any of the}} Nova engines. 35,542 SS packages were installed, making 1973 the best-selling year for the option. A modified rear side window shape was also introduced, eliminating the vent windows on both two- and four-door models. A revised rear suspension was adapted from the second generation Camaro with multi-leaf springs replacing the mono-leaf springs used on Novas since the original 1962 model. By this time, six-cylinder and V8 engines were de rigueur for American compact cars, with the [...] and [...] V8s becoming fairly common. The 1973 Nova with a six-cylinder engine or 307 cu. in.(5.0 L) [...] V8 were among the last Chevrolets to be offered with the two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission, which was in its final year. A dressy Custom series joined the Nova line and a Custom hatchback listed for $2,701 with a six-cylinder engine. That was $173 more than the six-cylinder base-model two-door hatchback. Air conditioning added $381. Every 1973 Chevrolet Nova got side guard door beams and additional sound insulation, as well as flow-through ventilation systems. A sunroof could be installed, and fold-down rear seats were available.|$|E

Mr. Lawrence, he's wonderful. Most comic! I shall never forget the night he came down as the Char of Persia, I think he called it--a sort of Eastern King it was. He had the big paper knife in his hand, and 'Mind, Dorcas,' he says, 'you'll have to be very respectful. This is my {{specially}} sharpened scimitar, and it's off with your head if I'm at all displeased with you!' Miss Cynthia, she was what they call an Apache, or some such name--a Frenchified sort of cut-throat, I take it to be. A real sight she looked. You'd never have believed a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into such a ruffian. Nobody would have known her." ...|$|E
