5|$|Jim Martin, {{positioned}} {{in the lower}} right, gives a coy and perhaps mischievous <b>glance</b> <b>back</b> at the viewer. He {{is a microcosm of}} the entire scene in which no one appears to be giving thanks in a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner. Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. She sees it as an example of treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the Last Supper and that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E
500|$|Many reviews complimented the episode's songs. Huffington Post {{reviewer}} Mike Moody {{noted that}} both the dry humor in the episode and its songs were humorous, writing, [...] "I usually find myself heading to the kitchen when the songs come on -- but I usually <b>glance</b> <b>back</b> at the TV to see if Jemaine is making a funny face – and I rush back to the couch once the last note drops. But I can't wait to download tonight's Police-inspired [...] jam." [...] The Guardian named [...] "Sugalumps" [...] {{one of the top}} five best season two Flight of the Conchords songs.|$|E
500|$|In 1930, Birkett was {{involved}} in the so-called Blazing Car murder case. On 6 November 1930, two men returning home in Northampton noticed a bright light in the distance and saw a man come out of a ditch {{at the side of the}} road, <b>glance</b> <b>back</b> toward the light and say [...] "looks like somebody has had a bonfire". The two young men ran toward the light, saw it was a burning car and fetched a policeman. When the fires died away, a body was found inside the boot of a car with a face so charred it was impossible to determine the identity of the man; the numberplate of the car was intact, however, and traced to an Alfred Arthur Rouse. Rouse was arrested and appeared at Northampton Crown Court on 26 January 1931, charged with the murder of an unknown man. He was defended by Donald Finnemore, and the Crown was represented by Birkett and Richard Elwes. Rouse was damned by a series of events. When arrested, he made statements such as [...] "I'm very glad it's over" [...] and [...] "I'm responsible" [...] and that the car engine had been off at the time of the fire, ruling out the possibility of accidental ignition. When he appeared as a witness, the defendant claimed that after giving an unknown man a lift, he had found that he was running out of petrol and had asked the passenger to take the spare can in the car and fill up the fuel tank. While he was doing this, Rouse testified that he went to the side of the road to urinate, and while there heard a large explosion. He said he saw a large flame and became convinced the petrol tank would explode. As such he ran away as fast as possible, at which point he ran into the two young men on the road.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Ghodsee {{published}} one of {{the first}} articles considering the gendered aspects of the growing nostalgia for the communist era in Eastern Europe. [...] Already beginning in the late 1990s, various scholars were examining the phenomenon of Ostalgie in former East Germany and what had been called “Yugo-nostalgia” in the successor states of the former Yugoslavia. This earlier work on the emergence of communist nostalgia focused on its consumer aspects and considered the phenomenon a necessary phase that post-socialist populations needed to pass through in order to fully break with their communist pasts. In contrast, her concept of [...] "red nostalgia" [...] considered how individual men and women experienced the loss of the real material benefits of the socialist past. Rather than just a wistful <b>glance</b> <b>back</b> at a lost youth, red nostalgia formed the basis of an emerging critique of the political and economic upheavals that characterized the post-socialist era. More recently, Ghodsee has explored the politics of public memory about communism, World War II, and the Bulgarian Holocaust.|$|E
