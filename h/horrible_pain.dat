60|$|Washington, May 18, 1864. DEAREST MOTHER--I {{will only}} write you a hasty note this time, as I am pretty tired, {{and my head}} feels disagreeable from being in too much. I was up {{yesterday}} to Carver hospital and again saw {{the man of the}} 51st, Thos. McCowell, who told me of George, up to latter part of Thursday, 12th inst. I questioned him, and his story was very clear, so I felt perfectly satisfied. He is wounded in hand; will be transferred soon to New York and may call on you. He is a young Irishman, and seems {{to be a very good}} fellow indeed. I have written to George, day before yesterday. Did you send my last letter to Han? If not, send it yet. Mother, I see such awful things. I expect one of these days, if I live, I shall have awful thoughts and dreams--but it is such a great thing to be able to do some real good; assuage these <b>horrible</b> <b>pains</b> and wounds, and save life even--that's the only thing that keeps a fellow up.|$|R

If I had only myself to think of, I should prefer the sharp pains to the frightful dreams. But the physical suffering exhausts me. If I let myself sink, it may end in my becoming useless to Mr. Blake at the time when he wants me most.|$|E
50|$|Once in Livorno, Artusi {{went to a}} {{restaurant}} to have dinner. After eating minestrone, he decided to rent {{a room in the}} building belonging to a man called Domenici. As Artusi would later recount, he spent the whole night suffering from <b>horrible</b> stomach <b>pains,</b> which he blamed on the minestrone he had eaten. The next day, returning to Florence, he got the news that Livorno had been hit by cholera and that Domenici had been a victim. It was only then that he realized what had happened: it had not been the minestrone that made him ill, but the early symptoms of the disease. The event inspired Artusi to write an excellent recipe for minestrone.|$|R
60|$|Then as I rode furiously {{round the}} last patch of {{intervening}} trees {{the sound of}} a pistol shot. I was out of them now and saw everything. There was the cart on the further side of a swamp. The horses were standing still and snorting. Holding the rein of one of the leaders was Rodd, whose horse also stood close by. He was rocking on his feet and as I leapt from my mare and ran up, I saw his face. It was <b>horrible,</b> full of <b>pain</b> and devilish rage. With his disengaged hand he pointed to Anscombe sitting in the cart and grasping a pistol that still smoked.|$|R
60|$|It was {{ten o'clock}} when Spencer went away and Vivienne LeMar passed up {{the hall to}} her room. Estella clenched her hands in an access of {{helpless}} rage. She was very angry, but under her fury was a <b>horrible</b> ache of <b>pain.</b> It could not be only three hours since {{she had been so}} happy! It must be more than that! What had happened? Had she made a fool of herself? Ought she to have behaved in any other way? Perhaps Spencer had come out to look for her after she had gone upstairs and, not finding her, had gone back to Miss LeMar to show her he was angry. This poor hope was a small comfort. She wished she had not acted as she had. It looked spiteful and jealous, and Spencer did not like people who were spiteful and jealous. She would show him she was sorry when he came back, and it would be all right.|$|R
60|$|In {{place of}} it he went downhill, falling into bushes, floundering to the {{shoulders}} through withered fern, {{and now and}} then stumbling over rotting trees, but the splashes grew closer, and he fancied the sound before him a little nearer. It was significant {{that there was any}} sound at all, because a deer usually clears every obstacle in its almost silent flight, and the gasping man took heart again. The quarry's strength was evidently failing as its life drained away, but darkness was also close at hand, and Alton knew that he could not hold out very long. Already there was a <b>horrible</b> <b>pain</b> in his left side and his sight was growing dim.|$|E

40|$|Differences {{in ethnic}} {{beliefs about the}} {{perceived}} need for local anesthesia for tooth drilling and childbirth labor were surveyed among Anglo-Americans, Mandarin Chinese, and Scandinavians (89 dentists and 251 patients) matched for age, gender, and occupation. Subjects matched survey questionnaire items selected from previously reported interview results to estimate (a) their beliefs about the possible use of anesthetic for tooth drilling and labor pain compared with other possible remedies and (b) the choice of pain descriptors {{associated with the use}} of nonuse of anesthetic, including descriptions of injection pain. Multidimensional scaling, Gamma, and Chi-square statistics as well as odds ratios and Spearman's correlations were employed in the analysis. Seventy-seven percent of American informants reported the use of anesthetics as possible remedies for drilling and 51 % reported the use of anesthetics for labor pain compared with 34 % that reported the use of anesthetics among Chinese for drilling and 5 % for labor pain and 70 % among Scandinavians for drilling and 35 % for labor pain. Most Americans and Swedes described tooth-drilling sensations as sharp, most Chinese used descriptors such as sharp and "sourish" (suan), and most Danes used words like shooting (jagende). By rank, Americans described labor pain as cramping, sharp, and excruciating, Chinese used words like sharp, intermittent, and horrible, Danes used words like shooting, tiring, and sharp, and Swedes used words like tiring, "good," yet <b>horrible.</b> Preferred <b>pain</b> descriptors for drilling, birth, and injection pains varied significantly by ethnicity. Results corroborated conclusions of a qualitative study about pain beliefs in relation to perceived needs for anesthetic in tooth drilling. Samples used to obtain the results were estimated to approach qualitative representativity for these urban ethnic groups...|$|R

Often his shoulders shook in agony over what he saw, and he shuddered to the teeth. He would have walked round the world on his knees to save her this long anguish! And then again it was less something he saw than something he was writing, and he altered it {{to make it more}} dramatic. [...] "I woke up." [...] How awful that was! but in this new scene she uttered no words. Lady Pippinworth was in his arms when they heard a little cry, so faint that a violin string makes as much moan when it snaps. In a dread silence he lit a match, and as it flared the figure of a girl was seen upon the floor. She was dead; and even as he knew that she was dead he recognized her. [...] "Grizel!" [...] he cried. The other woman who had lured him from his true love uttered a piercing scream and ran towards the hotel. When she returned with men and lanterns {{there was no one in}} the arbour, but there were what had been a man and a girl. They lay side by side. The startled onlookers unbared their heads. A solemn voice said, [...] "In death not divided." ...|$|R
50|$|As they {{go further}} into the mountains, they begin to have strange encounters. First, they are ambushed by gunmen who kill Trinoski. The team returns fire, killing {{multiple}} gunmen, but when they check the bodies, they have disappeared. That night, the team spots headlights of a vehicle approaching. However, the two lights separate and then speedily fly into the sky and disappear. After speculating on what the lights may have been, they radio for a helicopter to resupply them. The next day, they cannot get reception on their radio or GPS. Their truck, damaged from the ambush, is struggling {{to move up the}} mountain. At night, the team hears a helicopter approaching, though they cannot spot it. As their radio is not working, they attempt to signal the helicopter. As the helicopter, still unseen, seems to be directly on top of them, the noise abruptly stops (something that shouldn't be physically possible). Meanwhile, the radio picks up what sounds like Persian or Arabic, but no one can understand it. They cache Trinoski's body so that they can move to a safer position for the night. The next morning, the team finds parts of Trinoski's body strewn out across rocks. Further up the mountain, they spot strange, triangular markers made of sticks across the mountain's surface. As they continue on foot with their mission in the rocky and barren landscape, fatigue, frustration and confusion take their toll on the members of the team and they come across a cave. Inside, they find an old man who gives them shelter and refills their canteens. Sergeant Sadler notices that under the man's robes, he appears to be wearing a nineteenth-century British army uniform. Sadler tells the others of a legend of how a British regiment disappeared in Afghanistan's mountains, leaving only one survivor. In the morning Sergeant Cole observes the old man apparently talking to himself, but when Cole looks through his night vision goggles, he sees a group of men with swords in black robes. Panicking, the soldier opens fire, accidentally killing the old man. Abdul says they must bury the body, but Keynes orders the team to move on in case the enemy heard them. Degeteau develops <b>horrible</b> stomach <b>pains.</b> As he tries to drink from a canteen, he finds that it is filled with sand, as are the containers of everyone else. Further on, Abdul is surprised to find that there is an entire valley that wasn't there previously. Tensions further increase when the team encounters a bright light at night. As Tanner and Cole try to flank the light, believing it to be a ruse by the Taliban, they're immediately vaporized. The next morning, Abdul warns Keynes that they are dealing with a supernatural phenomenon that is beyond human conception and has deadly consequences; he then commits suicide by stepping off a cliff.|$|R

6000|$|My friends, {{suppose we}} quitted that stand; suppose we came {{honestly}} down from it, and said: [...] "This is our minimum of cotton-prices. We care not, for the present, to make cotton any cheaper. Do you, if it seem so blessed to you, make cotton cheaper. Fill your lungs with cotton-fuzz, your hearts with copperas-fumes, with rage and mutiny; become ye the general gnomes of Europe, slaves of the lamp!"--I admire a Nation which fancies it will die if it do not undersell all other Nations, {{to the end}} of the world. Brothers, we will cease to undersell them; we will be content to equal-sell them; to be happy selling equally with them! I do not see the use of underselling them. Cotton-cloth is already two-pence a yard or lower; and yet bare backs were never more numerous among us. Let inventive men cease to spend their existence incessantly contriving how cotton can be made cheaper; and try to invent, a little, how cotton at its present cheapness could be somewhat justlier divided among us. Let inventive men consider, Whether the Secret of this Universe, and of Man's Life there, does, after all, as we rashly fancy it, consist in making money? There is One God, just, supreme, almighty: but is Mammon the name of him?--With a Hell which means 'Failing to make money,' I do not think there is any Heaven possible that would suit one well; nor so much as an Earth that can be habitable long! In brief, all this Mammon-Gospel, of Supply-and-demand, Competition, Laissez-faire, and Devil take the hindmost, begins to be one of the shabbiest Gospels ever preached; or altogether the shabbiest. Even with Dilettante partridge-nets, and at a <b>horrible</b> expenditure of <b>pain,</b> who shall regret to see the entirely transient, and at best somewhat despicable life strangled out of it? At the best, as we say, a somewhat despicable, unvenerable thing, this same 'Laissez-faire;' and now, at the worst, fast growing an altogether detestable one! ...|$|R
40|$|My dissertation, Rejected Women in Film Noir, {{brings an}} {{innovative}} {{approach to a}} well-studied cycle of films in terms of character type and methodology by concentrating on a female character frequently pictured, but rarely discussed, which I am calling the "rejected woman. " Rejected women characters include: the faithful and taken-for-granted "girl Friday," the "B" girl (Noir code for fallen woman) fettered to a bar stool, who is used and discarded by the Noir hero, and the lonely spinster, who has a dull, unglamorous job like bookkeeper or telephone operator. She desires (positive) attention from the noir hero, yet only receives it in a negative form, culminating in either active or passive rejection through dismissal or indifference. This story line of rejection is mirrored in the physical and psychological pain she often endures. This narrative based "rejection" echoes the formal "rejection" of the character in the mise-en-scene [...] ;My methodology begins with close filmic readings and broadens to consider a number of ideological questions. I try to avoid a priori applications of ideological assumptions, and instead conduct detailed examinations of filmic textuality. I primarily utilize psychoanalytical film theory anchored in two of Jacques Lacan's texts: "The Mirror Stage" essay (1949), and The Four Fundamentals of Psychoanalysis (Seminar XI) (1964). A profound misunderstanding surrounding the term "the gaze" has caused confusion in derision in film theory discourse. I recommend that we consider Laura MulveyÂ 's application of Lacan's "Mirror Stage" essay be called "Look Theory," and Jacqueline Rose's, Joan CopjecÂ 's and Todd McGowanÂ 's application of Lacan's Seminar XI lectures be called "Gaze Theory. " After describing the reasons why this split is needed, as well as glossing the major points {{of each of these}} scholars' approaches to Lacan's work, I demonstrate how productive both "Look" theory and "Gaze" theory are in examining film generally and Rejected Women of Film Noir specifically.;By reading the rejected woman through MulveyÂ 's ground-breaking essay, "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema," I show how the rejected woman exists as a paradoxical locus of power. She is antinomic; simultaneously encompassing pain and pleasure, visibility and invisibility, movement and immobility, text and writing instrument. For example, Gaye Dawn in Key Largo appears metaphorically invisible to film's male characters (I bend MulveyÂ 's language, arguing that rejected women connote a "to-(not) -be-looked-at-ness"). Her invisibility grants her power unavailable to other characters, yet she uses this power solely {{for the benefit of the}} Noir hero. Because Key LargoÂ 's male character do not pay attention to her, like they do the home girl Nora, Gaye "becomes" invisible, and therefore, she can approach Rocco, steal his gun, and give it to Frank, which he will use to save his life. Despite risking her life, Gaye gains nothing from this act. She uses the power endowed by her invisibility solely to edify Frank.;Using Lacan's "Gaze" theory, I study the way the rejected woman both embodies the gaze and how objects in the film gaze at her. I argue that these gazes register as moments of escape, daydreaming and fantasy (Lacan's Imaginary register) as well as moments of pain, trauma and fascination (Lacan's Real register). Historically, she functions as the gaze because she reminds us collectively of traumas we may not wish to acknowledge consciously, such as racism and the invention and use of the atomic bomb. Objects in the diegesis gaze at her and tell the stories of her personal traumas (rape, prostitution, and death by <b>horrible</b> physical <b>pain)</b> as well as signify her attempts to create a world where fantasy and imagination provide a respite from her dull, dreary life and help her cope with the rejection she faces, most notably from the Noir hero.;Because my project involves close and detailed readings of specific filmic scenes, it focuses on a small selection of Film Noirs: The Maltese Falcon (John Huston 1941), Casablanca (Michael Curtiz 1942), Key Largo (John Huston 1948), Criss Cross (Robert Siodmak 1949), The Big Heat (Fritz Lang 1953) and The Blue Gardenia (Fritz Lang 1953), and Kiss Me Deadly (Robert Aldrich, 1955). I chose films using two criteria: 1) films that particularly are "rejection woman heavy," meaning they contained several examples of this figure, and 2) films that covered the fifteen-year time frame of the Film Noir cycle: 1941. 1955. I also include some outliers, focusing on them as precedents that prefigure the Rejected Woman character type, such as Pepe Le Moko (Julien Duvivier 1937) The Letter (William Wyler 1940), and Citizen Kane (Orson Welles 1941).

6000|$|Though he {{was several}} {{years younger than}} oneself, one always {{thought of him as}} [...] "Old Poirot" [...] indeed, he was soon called [...] "le grand-père," [...] though no more {{confirmed}} bachelor ever inhabited the world. He was a regular [...] "Miller of Dee," [...] caring for nobody; and yet he was likeable, that humorous old stoic, who suffered from gall-stones, and bore <b>horrible</b> bouts of <b>pain</b> like a hero. In spite of all his disabilities his health and appearance soon became robust in our easy-going hospital, where no one was harried, the food excellent, and the air good. He would tell you that his father lived to eighty, and his grandfather to a hundred, both [...] "strong men" [...] though not so strong as his old master, the squire, of whose feats in the hunting-field he would give most staggering accounts in an argot which could only be followed by instinct. A great narrator, he would describe at length life in the town of Nancy, where, when the War broke out, he was driving a market cart, and distributing vegetables, which had made him an authority on municipal reform. Though an incorrigible joker, his stockfish countenance would remain perfectly grave, except for an occasional hoarse chuckle. You would have thought he had no more power of compassion than a cat, no more sensibility than a Chinese idol; but this was not so. In his wooden, shrewd, distrustful way he responded to sympathy, and was even sorry for others. I used to like very much his attitude to the young [...] "stable-companion" [...] who had arrived with him; he had no contempt, such as he might easily have felt for so weakly a creature, but rather a real indulgence towards his feebleness. [...] "Ah!" [...] he would say at first; [...] "he won't make old bones--that one!" [...] But he seemed extremely pleased when, in a fortnight or so, he had to modify that view, for Bidan (Prosper) prospered more rapidly even than himself. That grey look was out of the boy's face within three weeks. It was wonderful to watch him come back to life, till at last he could say, with his dreadful Provençal twang, that he felt [...] "très biang." [...] A most amiable youth, he had been a cook, and his chief ambition was to travel till he had attained the summit of mortal hopes, and was cooking at the Ritz in London. When he came to us his limbs seemed almost to have lost their joints, they wambled so. He had no muscle at all. Utter anæmia had hold of all his body, and all but a corner of his French spirit. Round that unquenchable gleam of gaiety the rest of him slowly rallied. With proper food and air and freedom, he began to have a faint pink flush in his china-white cheeks; his lids no longer drooped, his limbs seemed to regain their joints, his hands ceased to swell, he complained less and less of the pains about his heart. When, of a morning, he was finished with, and [...] "le grand-père" [...] was having his hands done, they would engage in lively repartee--oblivious of one's presence. We began to feel that this grey ghost of a youth had been well named, after all, when they called him Prosper, so lyrical would he wax over the constitution and cooking of [...] "bouillabaisse," [...] over the South, and the buildings of his native Aix-en-Provence. In all France you could not have found a greater contrast than those two who had come to us so under the weather; nor in all France two better instances of the way men can regain health of body and spirit in the right surroundings.|$|R

In August 1476, the paralyzed and forlorn Isabelle of Armagnac, who in her youth had been promised to the king of England, died in <b>horrible</b> <b>pain</b> after drinking a potion prepared by the doctor to [...] "cure" [...] her. She was only 45. Gaston de Lyon immediately claimed the Quatre-Vallées. His attitude was so revolting that the duke of Alençon and the duke of Vendôme, relatives of Isabelle of Armagnac, sued Gaston de Lyon to prevent him from obtaining the Quatre-Vallées. The trial lasted for more than a century. At last, ruined and discouraged, the descendants of Gaston de Lyon ceded the Quatre-Vallées to Henry III of Navarre, who owned many Pyrenean fiefs (Béarn, Lower Navarre, Bigorre, County of Foix, Nébouzan).|$|E
