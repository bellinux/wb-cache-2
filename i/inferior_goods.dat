500|$|One reform St Vincent did achieve was the {{introduction}} of block making machinery at the navy yard in Portsmouth. The machinery was designed by Marc Isambard Brunel and Samuel Bentham. By 1808 forty-five machines were turning out 130,000 pulley blocks per year. The innovation meant that only ten to thirty unskilled men were able to equal the output of 100 skilled blockmakers and the capital cost {{of the project was}} recovered in three years. The revolution of machinery enabled the Navy to become self-sufficient in regard to the production of the essential blocks. This self-sufficiency removed a great deal of corruption, from external contractors producing <b>inferior</b> <b>goods</b> that jeopardised sailors' lives, to the corruption that arose from poorly paid officials responsible for awarding contracts and the bribes that might ensue. The buildings that housed the Block Machinery remain to this day and make up part of the Historic Portsmouth Dockyard.|$|E

The Government at Washington would fain act a humane part, and set apart reserves of land and supplies, but the agents through which the transactions are carried on have too often proved unfaithful, and palmed off <b>inferior</b> <b>goods</b> on the Indians, or brought up old debts against them; and in the meantime mutual injuries work up the settlers and the Red men to such a pitch of exasperation, that horrid cruelties are perpetrated on the one side, and on the other the wild men are shot down as pitilessly as beasts of prey, while the travellers and soldiers who live in daily watch and ward against the [...] "wily savage" [...] learn to stigmatize all pity for him as a sort of sentimentalism sprung from Cooper's novels.|$|E

50|$|Inter-city {{bus service}} {{is also an}} example of an <b>inferior</b> <b>good.</b> This form of {{transportation}} is cheaper than air or rail travel, but is more time-consuming. When money is constricted, traveling by bus becomes more acceptable, but when money is more abundant than time, more rapid transport is preferred. In some countries with less developed or poorly maintained railways, for example Serbia, this is reversed: trains are slower and cheaper than buses, so rail travel is an <b>inferior</b> <b>good.</b>|$|R
50|$|In economics, an <b>inferior</b> <b>good</b> {{is a good}} whose {{quantity}} demanded decreases when consumer income rises (or quantity demanded rises when consumer income decreases), unlike normal goods, {{for which}} the opposite is observed. Normal goods are those for which consumers' demand increases when their income increases. This would be the opposite of a superior good, one that {{is often associated with}} wealth and the wealthy, whereas an <b>inferior</b> <b>good</b> is often associated with lower socio-economic groups.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{examples}} of <b>inferior</b> <b>goods.</b> Several economists have suggested that shopping at large discount chains such as Walmart and rent-to-own establishments vastly represent {{a large percentage of}} goods referred to as [...] "inferior". Cheaper cars are examples of the <b>inferior</b> <b>goods.</b> Consumers will generally prefer cheaper cars when their income is constricted. As a consumer's income increases the demand of the cheap cars will decrease, while demand of costly cars will increase, so cheap cars are <b>inferior</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|E
50|$|Inexpensive {{foods like}} instant noodles, bologna, hamburger, mass-market beer, frozen dinners, and canned goods are {{additional}} examples of <b>inferior</b> <b>goods.</b> As incomes rise, one tends to purchase more expensive, appealing and nutritious foods.

50|$|Luxury {{goods are}} said to have high income {{elasticity}} of demand: as people become wealthier, they will buy {{more and more of the}} luxury good. This also means, however, that should there be a decline in income its demand will drop. Income elasticity of demand is not constant with respect to income, and may change sign at different levels of income. That is to say, a luxury good may become a normal good or even an <b>inferior</b> <b>good</b> at different income levels, e.g. a wealthy person stops buying increasing numbers of luxury cars for his or her automobile collection to start collecting airplanes (at such an income level, the luxury car would become an <b>inferior</b> <b>good).</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} incentives — other than altruism — developed countries have in improving technologies specific to developing countries. We propose a simple model {{of international trade}} between two regions, in which all individuals have similar preferences over an <b>inferior</b> <b>good</b> and a luxury good. The poor region has a comparative advantage {{in the production of}} the <b>inferior</b> <b>good,</b> and the rich in the luxury good. Even when costly adaptation of the technology to the poor region’s characteristics is required — which makes the technology inappropriate for local use — we show that there are parameter configurations for which the rich region has an incentive to incur this cost. By raising the efficiency of the productive process of the developing region, the developed region can redirect its own productive resources toward the luxury good; it can also benefit from an improvement in its terms of trade and gain access to a more diversified set of consumption choices. Indeed, there are cases where the rich region would prefer to improve the poor region’s technology for producing the <b>inferior</b> <b>good</b> rather than its own. Such technology transfers can increase the welfare of both regions. We apply our model to the Green Revolution and provide a quantitative assessment of its welfare effects...|$|R

50|$|Inferiority, in this sense, is an {{observable}} fact {{relating to}} affordability {{rather than a}} statement {{about the quality of}} the good.

40|$|This study {{utilizes}} {{a dynamic}} error correction model {{to analyze the}} demand for residential electricity in El Paso County, Texas. Annual data is provided by El Paso Electric Company covering the period from 1977 to 2011. This study reports negative income elasticities for residential electricity demand and indicates that electricity is treated as an <b>inferior</b> <b>good</b> in El Paso County. The negative income elasticity result runs counter to many earlier studies, although recent empirical evidence indicates that residential electricity is also treated as an <b>inferior</b> <b>good</b> in the Seattle service territory. Negative income elasticities are an interesting result, and may allow electric utilities to utilize existing generating capacity to sufficiently provide power to the service territory, even if the economy continues to expand. Further examination of electricity consumption behavior at the regional level is warranted. This study reports {{that in the long}} run, per capita residential electricity usage declines by 0. 36 percent for every 1 percent increase in real per capita income. ...|$|R

50|$|The Ayres Economy Basement concept {{dates back}} to the opening of its Indianapolis {{flagship}} store in 1905. The Economy Basement, later known as the Downstairs Store, Discount Shop, and Budget Store, operated differently than other retail department stores. The Ayres basement store did not offer cheaply made, <b>inferior</b> <b>goods.</b> Instead, it sold lower-priced items of good quality that served as an entry point for less-affluent customers until they could afford full-priced goods on the upper floors. It also served as a training ground for Ayres managers. By the 1960s the Budget Store had declined and was eclipsed by Ayr-Way, the Ayres discount subsidiary, and changes in shopping trends and pricing. The Budget Store concept was eliminated in the mid-1980s.|$|E
