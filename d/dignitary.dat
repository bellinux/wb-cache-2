5|$|After the war, de Peyster served {{overseas}} as a <b>dignitary.</b> When {{he returned}} to the United States, he ran for office and was elected to the State Assembly. His father disagreed with many of his political positions, and they eventually stopped speaking to each other. In 1900, the family feud culminated in a race for the office of Mayor of their native town, father running against son. After defeating his father, who owned the town hall, he was forced to move the Mayor's office to a new building. He died in 1903, survived by his three daughters.|$|E
60|$|Most dignities of this kingdom consist only of parochial tithes, and the <b>dignitaries</b> are {{ministers of}} parishes. A doubt may {{therefore}} arise, whether the said <b>dignitaries</b> are willed, required, and commanded, {{to make their}} contributions in both capacities, distinctly as <b>dignitaries,</b> and jointly as parsons or vicars.|$|R

5|$|Detective John Michael Gibson (March 29, 1956 – July 24, 1998) was a United States Capitol Police officer {{assigned}} to the <b>dignitary</b> protection detail of Congressman Tom DeLay. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery after lying in honor with Chestnut in the Capitol rotunda. Detective Gibson had served with the agency for 18 years. He {{was a native of}} Massachusetts who married the niece of Representative Joe Moakley, Democrat of Massachusetts. He had three children, a 17-year-old daughter and two boys, ages 15 and 14.|$|E
5|$|Nri {{maintained}} its vast authority {{well into the}} 16th century. The peace mandated by the Nri religion and enforced {{by the presence of}} the mbùríchi allowed trade to flourish. Items such as horses, which did not survive in tsetse fly-infested Nri, and seashells, which would have to be transported a long ways due to Nri's distance from the coast, have been found depicted in Nri's bronze. A Nri <b>dignitary</b> was unearthed with ivory, also indicating a wealth in trade existed among the Nri. Another source of income would have been the income brought back by traveling mbùríchi.|$|E
5|$|On November 4, 1824, {{just months}} after the election, the state capitol {{building}} was destroyed by a fire. Some furnishings and records were saved, but the four-year-old building was a total loss. When Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette toured the United States in 1825, a new capitol {{had not yet been}} constructed and the governor's mansion was too small to host a proper reception, so the governor had to entertain the <b>dignitary</b> at Weisiger's Tavern.|$|E
5000|$|The Grand <b>Dignitaries</b> of the French Empire {{were created}} in 1804 by the Constitution of the Year XII, which {{established}} Napoleon Bonaparte, previously First Consul for Life, as Emperor of the French. The seven Grand <b>Dignitaries</b> broadly paralleled the Great Officers of the Crown which had existed under the Ancien Regime and were essentially honorific, although several limited functions were ascribed {{to them in the}} new constitution of the Empire. In the Imperial nobility the Grand <b>Dignitaries</b> ranked in status directly behind the Princes of France, although in practice, most Grand <b>Dignitaries</b> also held the title of Prince.|$|R

Security for the facility {{is provided by the}} United States Secret Service during periods of occupancy by foreign heads of state and chiefs of government. During visits by other guests such as foreign ministers, the Diplomatic Security Service assumes the leading role.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} {{of people}} who have {{addressed}} both Houses of the United Kingdom Parliament at the same time. Although English and later British monarchs have jointly addressed the House of Commons and the House of Lords on several occasions since the 16th century, the first foreign <b>dignitary</b> to do so was French President Albert Lebrun in March 1939. The list excludes the speeches given by (or on behalf of) the Sovereign at the State Opening of Parliament and at the close of each parliamentary session.|$|E
5|$|A {{public meeting}} in February 1919 {{established}} a consensus {{to create a}} monument and a fund {{for the families of}} wounded servicemen. The meeting agreed to commission Lutyens to design the monument. His design for a bridge over the River Roch was abandoned after a local <b>dignitary</b> purchased a plot of land adjacent to Rochdale Town Hall and donated it for the site of the memorial. Lutyens revised his design and Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby, unveiled the memorial on 26 November 1922. It is a Grade I listed structure, having been upgraded in 2015 when Lutyens' war memorials were declared a national collection.|$|E

5000|$|In 1807 two new <b>dignitaries</b> were created, {{a further}} two in 1809, {{and another in}} 1810, raising the final number to twelve. Many of the <b>dignitaries</b> were also members of the Imperial Family, with those that were not being {{high-ranking}} figures in the Imperial administration. The Grand <b>Dignitaries</b> were abolished along with the First Empire in 1814 upon the Bourbon Restoration, the Great Officers of the Crown of France being resurrected, and were not restored under the Second Empire.|$|R
50|$|After {{canceling}} {{the party}} and {{getting rid of the}} gangs that will play the rich <b>dignitaries,</b> Kuo tries to convince the real <b>dignitaries</b> of Hong Kong to help him. As soon as Madame Kao is about to confess to Belle's fiance and father about her real life, the real <b>dignitaries</b> come in for the party, with Kuo having convinced them that he could not do this without them. This leaves everyone crying in relief in pulling this illusion over to the end.|$|R
5|$|Seventy years later, the French {{explorer}} Samuel de Champlain {{reported that}} the StLawrence Iroquoians and their settlements had disappeared altogether from the StLawrence valley. This {{is believed to be}} due to outmigration, epidemics of European diseases, or intertribal wars. In 1611 Champlain established a fur trading post on the Island of Montreal, on a site initially named La Place Royale. At the confluence of Petite Riviere and St. Lawrence River, it is where present-day Pointe-à-Callière stands. On his 1616 map, Samuel de Champlain named the island Lille de Villemenon, in honour of the sieur de Villemenon, a French <b>dignitary</b> who was seeking the viceroyship of New France. In 1639 Jérôme Le Royer de La Dauversière obtained the Seigneurial title to the Island of Montreal {{in the name of the}} Notre Dame Society of Montreal to establish a Roman Catholic mission to evangelize natives.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{inspired}} by the Dominique Strauss-Kahn arrest. Strauss-Kahn, who was head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and considered the front-runner in the French presidential election, was accused of sexually assaulting a maid at a midtown Manhattan hotel in May 2011. He pleaded not guilty to all charges, but quit his IMF post, and his presidential candidacy was sidetracked. Subsequently, the case against him weakened as prosecutors said his accuser admitted to lying to a grand jury about events surrounding the attack. Franco Nero portrays a Strauss-Kahn like character, Roberto DiStasio, but he is an Italian <b>dignitary.</b> Ron Rifkin plays DiStasio's defense attorney, who is similar to Strauss-Kahn's real life attorney, Benjamin Brafman.|$|E

The flag has to be flown from a staff affixed firmly either on the middle front or to the front {{right side of the}} car.

5|$|On 15 February 2011, Gillard {{made her}} {{first trip to}} New Zealand, during which she met with Key and held a luncheon with {{business}} leaders in Auckland. It marked the first New Zealand visit of a prime minister since Howard visited in 2007. To conclude her two-day visit to New Zealand, Gillard travelled to Wellington on 16 February, where {{she became the first}} foreign <b>dignitary</b> to address the New Zealand Parliament in its history. In her speech, Gillard reflected on the countries' close ties to one another, their shared defence history, and efforts to increase economic cooperation. Her second visit to New Zealand, coincided with the September 2011 gathering of the Pacific Islands Forum, held in Auckland, of which both Australia and New Zealand are members. Gillard made her final trip to New Zealand on 9 February 2013; visiting Queenstown, she and Prime Minister Key announced a deal on asylum seekers, which would see New Zealand accept 150 refugees annually from Australia, starting in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The flag, when {{carried in}} a {{procession}} or parade or with another flag or flags, {{should be on the}} marching right or alone in the centre at the front. The flag may form a distinctive feature of the unveiling of a statue, monument, or plaque, but should never be used as the covering for the object. As a mark of respect to the flag, it should never be dipped to a person or thing, as opposed to regimental colours, organisational or institutional flags, which may be dipped as a mark of honour. During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag, or when the flag is passing in a parade or in a review, all persons present should face the flag and stand at attention. Those present in uniform should render the appropriate salute. When the flag is in a moving column, persons present will stand at attention or salute as the flag passes them. A <b>dignitary</b> may take the salute without a head dress. The flag salutation should be followed by the playing of the national anthem.|$|E
