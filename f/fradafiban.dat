40|$|OBJECTIVE—Lefradafiban is the orally active prodrug of <b>fradafiban,</b> a {{glycoprotein}} IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist. The present phase II study {{aimed to}} determine the dose of lefradafiban that provides 80 % blockade of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors by <b>fradafiban,</b> and to study the pharmacodynamics and safety of different doses in patients with stable angina undergoing angioplasty.  DESIGN—A double blind, placebo controlled, dose finding study.  SETTING—Four academic and community hospitals in the Netherlands.  PATIENTS— 64 patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.  INTERVENTIONS— 30  mg, 45  mg, and 60  mg of lefradafiban three times daily or placebo was given for 48  hours.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—The primary safety end point was the occurrence of bleeding, classified as major, minor, or insignificant according to the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) criteria. Efficacy indices included per cent fibrinogen receptor occupancy (FRO), ex vivo platelet aggregation, and plasma concentrations of <b>fradafiban.</b>  RESULTS—Administration of lefradafiban 30,  45, and 60  mg three times daily resulted in a dose dependent increase in median FRO levels of 71 %, 85 %, and 88 %, respectively. Inhibition of platelet aggregation was closely related to FRO. There were no major bleeding events. The 60  mg lefradafiban group had a high (71 %) incidence of minor and insignificant bleeding. The incidence of bleeding was 44 % in the 30  mg and 45  mg groups, compared with 9 % in placebo patients. Puncture site bleeding {{was the most common}} event. The odds of bleeding increased by 3 % for every 1 % increase in FRO.  CONCLUSIONS—Lefradafiban is an effective oral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blocker. The clinical effectiveness of doses up to 45  mg three times daily should be investigated.    Keywords: platelet aggregation inhibitors; glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers; lefradafiban; angioplast...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{examined}} {{the contribution of}} cyclooxygenase (COX) - 1 and - 2 to the generation of prostacyclin, thromboxane (Tx) A 2, and 8 -epi prostaglandin (PG) F 2 αduring {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA). BackgroundBoth TxA 2 and 8 -epi PGF 2 αactivate platelets and are mitogenic, whereas prostacyclin is a platelet inhibitor, and therefore may influence the outcome of PTCA. MethodsTwenty-one patients undergoing PTCA while receiving aspirin 300 mg daily or aspirin plus the selective COX- 2 inhibitor nimesulide were compared with 13 patients treated only with <b>fradafiban,</b> a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist. Urine was analyzed for the metabolites of TxA 2 (Tx-M) and prostacyclin (PGI-M) and for the isoprostane, 8 -epi PGF 2 α. ResultsIn the <b>fradafiban</b> group, there was a marked increase in Tx-M during PTCA (mean, 1, 973; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 112 to 3, 834 rising to mean 7, 645; 95 % CI 2, 009 to 13, 281 pg/mg creatinine, p = 0. 018). The Tx-M excretion was similarly reduced by aspirin and the combination of aspirin and nimesulide. In contrast, the combination of nimesulide and aspirin inhibited PGI-M excretion {{to a greater extent than}} aspirin (p = 0. 001). Urinary 8 -epi PGF 2 αexcretion was elevated following PTCA compared with normal subjects (p = 0. 002) and appeared to be unaffected by any of the treatments. ConclusionsThe increase in TxA 2 during PTCA is primarily COX- 1 dependent, and aspirin alone is effective in suppressing its formation. In contrast, prostacyclin generation is both COX- 1 and COX- 2 dependent. The inhibition of COX- 1 and COX- 2 did not prevent the production of 8 -epi PGF 2 α, suggesting that this is not enzymatically derived. The persistent generation of 8 -epi PGF 2 αmay contribute to the thrombosis and restenosis that complicate PTCA...|$|E
