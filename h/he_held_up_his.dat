25|$|Paxton {{was visiting}} London in his {{capacity}} as a director of the Midland Railway to meet the chairman John Ellis who was also a member of parliament. He happened to mention an idea he had for the hall, and Ellis promptly encouraged to produce some plans, provided they could be ready in nine days. Unfortunately he was committed for the next few days, but at a board meeting of the railway in Derby, it is said he appeared to be spending much of his time doodling on a sheet of blotting paper. At the end of the meeting <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> first sketch of the Crystal Palace, inspired by the Victoria Regia House. The sketch is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|E
60|$|Douglas shook Elizabeth by the hand. Then <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> glass.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> hand {{as though}} to check further speech, and listened for a moment intently.|$|E
60|$|But {{the cries}} now drowned his voice, and <b>he</b> again <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> hand.|$|R
50|$|Kotter {{received}} the Olympic Order in 1999. He was also named an honorary past-president of FIBT, a position <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> until <b>his</b> death.|$|R
60|$|He {{felt that}} so far <b>he</b> had <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> end of the {{conversation}} in a very creditable manner, but that extreme discretion was advisable.|$|R
60|$|Havill {{was smoking}} on his {{doorstep}} when Dare passed up the street. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> candle, {{and there}} was a great, dark smudge upon the white plaster above us.|$|E
60|$|Lord Arranmore {{shook his}} head. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> {{wineglass}} thoughtfully as though criticizing the clearness of the amber fluid.|$|E
5000|$|He {{retired from}} Paramount Pictures in 1959 and {{thereafter}} assumed Chairman Emeritus status, a position <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> until <b>his</b> {{death at the}} age of 103 in Los Angeles.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite well, sir, but <b>he</b> never <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> head since <b>he</b> heard it, {{and poor}} Miss Mary has so moped about. If ever I thought {{to see the}} like--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good," [...] {{said the}} attorney. [...] "Then tell me, Mr. Throgton, {{if you ever}} saw this blue {{envelope}} before?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> in <b>his</b> hand a long blue envelope.|$|R
6000|$|The Indian laughed tauntingly, as <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> reeking hand, and answered,--"It is red, but {{it comes}} from white veins!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> finger. The tide had turned, {{and through}} the half-open window came the low thunder of the waves.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> {{hands and}} noticed her little shiver {{as she saw}} the scarred knuckles, hard, {{ingrained}} flesh, and broken nails.|$|E
6000|$|... "He said nothing, but he {{had caught}} me once with his keys, and I think that he suspected. I read in his eyes that he suspected. As you know, <b>he</b> never <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> head again." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1739 he {{obtained}} {{the position of}} Master of the Jewel Office, a post <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> to <b>his</b> death. <b>He</b> died in Bath on 21 September 1744 and was buried at East Grinstead on 30 September 1744, with administration of his estate granted on 20 November 1744.|$|R
50|$|On {{giving up}} the {{presidency}} in 1861, Montt became President of the Supreme Court, a position which <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> to <b>his</b> death in September 1880. His nephew Jorge (born 1846) was president of Chile in 1891-1896, {{as well as his}} son, Pedro (died 1910), between 1906 and 1910.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> huge paws, and as I {{stared at}} the battered, malformed {{knuckles}} I understood {{the nature of his}} work.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> hand, and {{the silver}} thread of the woman's sorrow rose through the silence and the calm. Fairfax joined in softly.|$|E
60|$|What {{could this}} mean? Going {{up a little}} higher, <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> lantern and looked within, but saw no signs of the ladder.|$|E
50|$|In 1881 {{he became}} a {{professor}} of archaeology at the University of Rostock, and later served {{as director of the}} German Archaeological Institute in Rome (1905-07).

6000|$|As I talk I {{remember}} all, I {{remember the}} Declaration, [...] It was read here, the whole army paraded, it was read to us here, [...] By his staff surrounded the General {{stood in the}} middle, <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> [...] <b>his</b> unsheath'd sword, [...] It glitter'd in the sun in full sight of the army.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{a romance}} there, you know. Mr. Fletcher {{was in love}} with Emily Wharton, and she threw him over for Lopez. They say <b>he</b> has not <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> head since." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{vehicle was}} half full of passengers, mostly women. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> stick at its approach, {{and the woman}} who was driving drew rein.|$|E
60|$|They {{climbed down}} the hill. At its foot Otter cast {{backwards}} and forwards among the bushes like a hound. Then <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> hand and whistled.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. Indeed, at no hand would I {{have thought}} of it! And for you--didn't you ask me? This is not your writing?" [...] And <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... “We shall {{know how}} to answer the {{insolence}} of these Americans, señores,” <b>he</b> said, and <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> wine‐glass as <b>he</b> turned to Harper. “It is demanded that you join us—Viva la España!” ...|$|R
5000|$|In Don Sylvia von Rosalva (1764), {{a romance}} in {{imitation}} of Don Quixote, <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> to ridicule <b>his</b> earlier faith [...] and in the Comische Erzählungen (1765) he gave his extravagant imagination only too free a rein.|$|R
50|$|Mihalovich first {{studied in}} Pest with Mihály Mosonyi. In 1865, {{he moved to}} Leipzig, {{studying}} there with Moritz Hauptmann, and, in 1866, he completed his studies in Munich with Peter Cornelius. Mihalovich then moved back to Pest; in 1872, he {{became president of the}} city's Wagner Society and, in 1887, he followed Franz Liszt {{as the head of the}} Budapest Academy of Music, a position <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> to <b>his</b> death.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> hands. His {{knuckles}} were {{bloody and}} {{it was impossible to}} tell whether from injury to them or not. But his left forearm was badly cut.|$|E
60|$|Hans {{was not far}} off, shambling {{along in}} his own {{peculiar}} fashion. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> lantern and by the dim rays made out a building some distance away.|$|E
6000|$|... "It will do that, Mr. Gerard; {{everybody}} {{along the}} river knows the boat." [...] <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> lean trembling hand. [...] "Old fingers don't always tie fast knots." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> again <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> foot, {{which had}} a gouty {{appearance}} owing to its being contained in a dumpy little worsted sock, and I thought he proposed to repeat his first performance, but in this I did him an injustice, for, unlike Porthos, he was one who scorned {{to do the same}} feat twice; perhaps, like the conjurors, he knew that the audience were more on the alert the second time.|$|R
60|$|They stopped {{their talk}} and {{recognized}} {{him with an}} exchange of consciousness. Then, as if compelled by an irresistible importance in their topic, they began again; that is, one of them began to talk again, {{and the other to}} listen, and Gaites from almost the first word joined the listener with all his might, though <b>he</b> diligently <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> paper between himself and the speaker and pretended to be reading.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Poor Mr. Martindale! I wish {{he could}} recover his spirits. <b>He</b> has never <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> head since Miss Fotheringham's death. He is an admirable person, {{but it is}} melancholy to see him {{spending}} his life in that lonely manner.' ...|$|R
