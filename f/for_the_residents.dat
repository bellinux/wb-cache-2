5|$|Following these events, Macrinus {{traveled}} to Apamea {{to ensure the}} loyalty of Legio II Parthica before setting off to march against Emesa. According to Dio, Macrinus appointed his son Diadumenian {{to the position of}} Imperator, and promised the soldiers 20,000 Sesterces each, with 4,000 of these to be paid on the spot. Dio further comments that Macrinus hosted a dinner <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>residents</b> of Apamea in honour of Diadumenian. At the dinner, Macrinus was supposedly presented with the head of Ulpius Julianus who had been killed by his soldiers. In response, Macrinus left Apamea headed south.|$|E
5|$|Hinde died in Coronado on March 10, 1915, aged 82. In {{accordance}} with his wishes, the funeral service {{held in the}} Episcopal Church that he built <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>residents</b> of Coronado was modest. Hinde is buried in Mount Hope Cemetery, San Diego, California.

5|$|On 30 September 2014, the Inkatha Freedom Party {{expressed}} its concern <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>residents</b> of Khuma as {{repairs to}} their homes were delayed and had not yet commenced. Provincial government spokesperson, Bonolo Mohlakoana said that construction was delayed partly {{due to a lack}} of structural engineers, which were needed to assess the structural damage caused to the houses. Several families affected by the earthquake moved to a community centre while waiting for their houses to be repaired after affected families were instructed to move to safer locations.|$|E

5|$|After {{a catastrophic}} flood in 1889, the Johnstown Inclined Plane was {{completed}} in 1891 {{to serve as an}} escape route for future floods, as well as a convenient mode of transportation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>residents</b> of the new communities situated above the valley. It was operated by Cambria Iron Company and its successor Bethlehem Steel until 1935, when it was sold to the borough of Westmont. The incline was briefly shut down in 1962 when its supply of power from Bethlehem Steel was terminated. Twice in its history, the Johnstown Inclined Plane fulfilled its role as a means of evacuation from floodsonce in 1936 and again in 1977. The incline was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1994. It had major renovations in 1962 and from 1983 to 1984.|$|E
5|$|In December 1970 Gomułka {{scored a}} major {{political}} victory when Poland obtained a West German recognition of the post-World War II borders. The German side secured the right to emigrate to West Germany <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>residents</b> of Poland of German identity and to help financially those who stayed by granting pensions: hundreds of thousands eventually became affected. German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who signed the agreement, also asked on his knees for forgiveness for the crimes of the Nazis (Warschauer Kniefall). His gesture was understood in Poland as being addressed to all Poles, although it was actually made {{at the site of}} the Warsaw Ghetto and was thus directed primarily toward the Jews. The notable reconciliation process between the Polish and German nations was initiated five years earlier, when the Polish Church issued its famous Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops, criticized then by the Polish government.|$|E
5|$|The Cayman Islands were {{expected}} to suffer badly if Hurricane Dean passed too close, and mandatory evacuations were instigated for the low-lying Little Cayman. Tourists were forbidden from entering the island and extra flights were added to evacuate those that were already there. Schools and civic centers were converted to shelters on Grand Cayman and Cayman Brac, and, despite the mandatory evacuation, one shelter was opened on Little Cayman <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>residents</b> who remained there. Expecting catastrophic damage, two Royal Navy ships of the Atlantic Patrol Task (North), HMS Portland and RFA Wave Ruler, followed 150mi (240km) behind the storm in order to arrive at Cayman as soon after the hurricane as possible.|$|E

5|$|Despite never moving onto land, Nina's {{proximity}} to Hawaii and the forecasts for an imminent landfall resulted in massive evacuations. An estimated 300people living in Hanapepe and Hanalei {{were forced to}} evacuate when the Hanalei River overflowed its banks. An estimated 1,500people on Kauai were evacuated to higher ground, where the Red Cross had established seven evacuation centers for these people to evacuate to. In addition, thirteen members of the United States Coast Guard were evacuated from low-lying islands and harbors when they were threatened by rising tides triggered by the hurricane {{and the threat of}} flooding forced 420military personnel and families in Waikiki's Ft. Derussy and Ft. Armstrong as well as those living in Ft. Kamehameha, near Pearl Harbor to leave for higher ground. 270 were housed in Tripler Army Hospital and a temporary shelter was opened in Ft. Shafter, both of which were on high ground. In anticipation of Nina, 85 planes were flown away from Barber's Point Naval Air Base to Midway and several commercial flights were cancelled until the storm had passed. There was also concern <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>residents</b> of the privately owned Niihau, the closest landmass to the center of Nina and 20miles closer than Kauai. The island's only communications was by boat and most attempts at reaching the island failed due to high surf.|$|E
5|$|The {{extended}} period of power outage was a major problem <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>residents</b> in Broome. Residents {{had to wait for}} days for the power supply to be restored. As all of the distribution lines were above ground, Broome was particularly vulnerable to power outages during cyclones. Linesmen from Western Power were called in from afar to inspect all high voltage distribution lines before these could be re-energised. Western Power inspectors were also flown in from around the state to commence disconnections of properties suspected to have suffered water intrusion. These properties had to be tested before having supply reconnected. The majority of residential properties had power restored back on 30 April, 11days after Rosita struck. Television and radio were limited to transmissions from Perth, and this proved difficult to access information about any available supplies in the town. People had difficulties purchasing food and supplies because supermarkets were closed or had no power and there was no fresh produce arriving. However, power was restored {{a few days after the}} cyclone hit. There were only minor interruptions to the water and sewerage infrastructure.|$|E
