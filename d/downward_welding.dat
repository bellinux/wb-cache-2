40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} insure the {{accuracy}} of steam turbine thermal test in power plant, the flowrate measurement accuracy of condensate water should be insured. In this paper, the portable and integrated type flow measuring device for condensate water of 300 MW steam turbine flow is designed, {{which is based on}} the condensate water parameters and the specific pipeline conditions at the exit of the No. 5 low pressure heater for 300 MW unit. A integration of non standard differential pressure orifice flow meter is designed in this paper Through calibration in standard experimental system, the reason of the large error is that the flow field is disturbed by the origin plate type <b>downward</b> <b>welding</b> connecting flanges. Then the welding neck flanges is designed for the connecting flanges. The distribution of connecting flanges of flow field is weaken, and the measurement accuracy can meet the demand of steam turbine thermal test...|$|E

The corrosion resistance in joints formed by friction stir welding has been improved by welding parameter adjustments (Jariyaboon, et al., 2007; Krishnan, et al., 2009). Akinlabi, et al. (2014) analysed the corrosion properties of friction stir welded joints and found that the joint corrosion rate decreased as the rotation speed of friction stir increased. Moreover, the rotation speed improved the better material flow in the joint through stirring action of the tool (Liu, et al., 2008). Changes in friction stir welding tools with the same welding parameters have resulted in variation in the weld microstructure and properties. Different tool configurations vary the frictional heating effects thereby influencing the mode of deformation in metal (Mubiayi and Akinlabi, 2013). For instance, Sarvghad-Moghaddam, et al. (2014) showed the dominant impact of the tool on the properties and microstructure in the weld by varying the tool shoulder and pin. Galv√£o et al. (2010; 2012) who experimented on friction stir welding using scrolled and conical friction stir tools showed that the tool has immense influence on the production of successful welded joints. With a conical shoulder tool, Al at the advancing side resulted in irregular microstructure; however, defect formation was reduced. Al at the retreating side resulted in intermetallic compound formation from the mechanical mixing of Al into the Cu matrix. Welds formed by a conical tool had smooth appearance and grain refinement. With a scrolled shoulder tool, both joints had brittle intermetallic compound formation through the <b>downward</b> material flow. <b>Weld</b> surface had a shiny weld bead with deep voids. Most research suggests that to reduce the intermetallic compounds in friction stir welding, the tool should be placed in the Cu at the retreating side (Liu, et al., 2008; Tan, et al., 2013). However, Xue, et al.(2010) suggest that offsetting the tool in the Al side reduces the intermetallic compound thickness and defect formation and improves bending and tensile properties. Their study also showed that a thin and uniform continuous layer of intermetallic compound improved the bonding strength and mechanical properties of the joint. Appropriate selection of tools and tool positioning on material (i.e. advancing side and retreating side) in the friction-stir welding process reduces the intermetallic compound formation and thereby improves the joint strength.|$|R
