To answer these questions, we build a simple two-country model with horizontally differentiated NGOs competing in fundraising. We find that NGOs become multinational if the economies of scale in fundraising are sufficiently large. In that case, national NGOs in the smaller country disappear, while some national NGOs remain in the larger country only if country sizes are sufficiently different.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a compact new open macroeconomics {{model of a}} Monetary Union to evaluate, on the one hand, the consequences <b>of</b> the imperfect <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> the goods and labour markets, when countries are hit by asymmetric shocks and, on the other hand, the macroeconomic and welfare gains associated with a further <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> either <b>market.</b> First we outline the stabilising nature of short run fixed wages since macroeconomic adjustment is characterised by a lower volatility of the main aggregates. A greater <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> either <b>market</b> smoothes macroeconomic adjustment, but does not necessarily lead to big gains in terms of inflation differential reduction when wages are fixed in the short run. Second, when wages are fixed, a greater <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> the goods <b>market</b> increases welfare dispersion while an increase in labour market integration reduces per capita welfare dispersion in the union. Thus the Mundellian OCA criterion clearly dominates Mc Kinnon’s. Nevertheless, the optimality of the Mundellian criterion rests {{on the fact that}} wages are fixed in the short run since wage flexibility, on the one hand, makes welfare dispersion unaffected by the relative <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> either <b>market</b> when the monetary union is affected by asymmetric demand shocks, and, on the other hand, the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> the goods <b>market</b> is a key factor for reducing welfare dispersion in the union following an asymmetric productivity shock...|$|R
