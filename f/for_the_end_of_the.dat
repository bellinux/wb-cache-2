5|$|Amid German defeats {{against the}} Russians on the Eastern Front after 1942, the King {{prepared}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. He ordered {{the preparation of}} a document, known as the Political Testament (Testament Politique), which would justify his behaviour under the occupation and detail his interventions on behalf of Belgian prisoners of war and deported workers. Leopold however continued to condemn {{the action of the}} Belgian government in exile (based in London after October 1940). On 7 June 1944, following D-Day, he was deported to Germany. He was finally liberated by American forces on 7 May 1945.|$|E

5|$|Following Kasa-Vubu's reinstatement, {{there was}} an {{attempted}} rapprochement between the Congolese factions. Tshombe began negotiations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secession {{and the formation of}} a confederal Congo. Although a compromise agreement was reached, it was prevented from taking effect as negotiations broke down amid personal animosity between Kasa-Vubu and Tshombe. An attempted reconciliation in July 1961 {{led to the formation of}} a new government, led by Cyrille Adoula, which brought together deputies from both Lumumbist and South Kasai factions but also failed to bring a reconciliation with Katanga.|$|E
5|$|However, over time, the {{cumulative}} {{probability of a}} chance encounter with a star increases, and disruption of the planets becomes all but inevitable. Assuming that the Big Crunch or Big Rip scenarios <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe do not occur, calculations suggest that the gravity of passing stars will have completely stripped the dead Sun of its remaining planets within 1quadrillion (1015) years. This point {{marks the end of}} the Solar System. Although the Sun and planets may survive, the Solar System, in any meaningful sense, will cease to exist.|$|E

5|$|Some Bach {{scholars}} {{believed that}} the cantata was written in 1734 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War of the Polish Succession, but {{the discovery of the}} printed text showed that it was not related.

5|$|The {{story of}} Operation Ten-Go is revered {{to some degree}} in modern Japan as {{evidenced}} by appearances of the story in popular Japanese culture which usually portray the event as a brave, selfless, but futile, symbolic effort by the participating Japanese sailors to defend their homeland. One {{of the reasons the}} event may have such significance in Japanese culture is that the word Yamato was often used as a poetic name for Japan. Thus, the end of battleship Yamato could serve as a metaphor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese empire.|$|E
5|$|Various {{features}} in the print are meant to intensify the feelings of dread: the murder {{takes place in a}} graveyard, said to be St Pancras but suggested by John Ireland to resemble Marylebone; an owl and a bat fly around the scene; the moon shines down on the crime; the clock strikes one <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> witching hour. The composition of the image may allude to Anthony van Dyck's The Arrest of Christ.

5|$|Architectural {{evidence}} suggests that, while the Romanesque style peaked {{in much of}} Europe in the later eleventh and early twelfth century, it was still reaching Scotland {{in the second half}} of the twelfth century and was revived in the late fifteenth century, perhaps as a reaction to the English perpendicular style that had come to dominate. Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, a small number of significant crafted items have also survived and, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period, there is evidence of painting, particularly the extensive commissioning of works in the Low Countries and France.|$|E
5|$|In Brazil, Décio Colla, the Mayor of the City of São Francisco de Paula, Rio Grande do Sul, mobilized the {{population}} to prepare <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world by stocking up on food and supplies. In the city of Corguinho, in the Mato Grosso do Sul, a colony was built for survivors of the expected tragedy. In Alto Paraíso de Goiás, the hotels also made specific reservations for prophetic dates. On 11 October 2012, in the Brazilian city of Teresina, police interrupted what was {{believed to have been}} an attempted mass suicide by up to one hundred members of a cult headed by self-proclaimed prophet Luis Pereira dos Santos, who predicted {{the end of the world}} on the feast day of Our Lady of Aparecida.

5|$|Various astronomical {{alignments}} and numerological formulae were {{proposed as}} pertaining to this date. A New Age interpretation {{held that the}} date marked {{the start of a}} period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation, and that 21 December 2012 would mark {{the beginning of a new}} era. Others suggested that the date marked the end of the world or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world included the arrival of the next solar maximum, an interaction between Earth and the black hole at the center of the galaxy, or Earth's collision with a planet called Nibiru.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} {{hours of the}} {{legislative}} session, both houses of the General Assembly resorted to the controversial practice of stopping the clocks in their respective chambers {{a few minutes before}} midnight {{in order to avoid the}} constitutionally mandated deadline <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> session – midnight on April 15. The Assembly then passed twelve bills between midnight and 1 o'clock on April 16 before adjourning. Among those bills was House Bill 79, which provided funding and direction for the state's road-building plan for the next six years. The bill was delivered to Beshear later in the day, and he vetoed it on April 26. With the General Assembly unable to reconvene and override the veto, Senate President David Williams filed suit, claiming Beshear's veto was invalid because it was not issued within 10 days of the bill's passage. Williams' reasoning was based on the fact that, according to the legislative record, the bill was passed on April 15. Beshear counter-sued, claiming the bill was actually passed on April 16 and thus invalid to begin with. On July 31, 2008, a Lexington judge sided with Beshear, invalidating the law and declaring that the General Assembly would no longer be allowed to use the practice of stopping the clocks; he did not rule on the validity of the other bills passed after the session expired.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd New Zealand Division {{had moved}} into the front line in November in order to relieve the 8th Indian Division and would {{take part in the}} advance across the Sangro planned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> month. The brigade {{subsequently}} occupied positions around Atessa, with the Māori Battalion in brigade reserve, occupying a series of low hills which formed the Sangro river valley. The Eighth Army's forward units had reached the Sangro in early November and General Harold Alexander—commander of the 15th Army Group—had planned for Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery to strike across the river on its coastal plain on 20 November with V Corps. Montgomery shifted the 8th Indian Division to the right in secret to narrow the V Corps front and concentrate its power, bringing the newly arrived 2nd New Zealand Division into the gap. Heavy rain flooded the river, forcing the postponement of the offensive and giving the Germans time to move in reinforcements. In the early hours of 28 November the Eighth Army attack began, supported by heavy artillery concentrations. The New Zealanders advanced steadily, capturing the bulk of their objectives. The Māori Battalion, still in brigade reserve, stood to during the attack but was not required.|$|E
