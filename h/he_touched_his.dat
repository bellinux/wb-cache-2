25|$|In a {{press conference}} on November 10, 2008, Tomita {{announced}} his retirement from the sport. Tomita cited the decline of his strength and the inability to continue performing gymnastics {{at a high level}} as the reason for his retirement. Tomita's final competition as an elite gymnast was in the World Cup Final in Madrid, Spain, where the only event championships were contested with no all-around competition. Tomita competed in both the parallel bars and high bar competition. Tomita was 6th at the parallel bars because of some visible mistakes. In his final competition in the high bar, Tomita performed with his signature skills and elegance, the only obvious error he committed was when <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> hand to the mat after his dismount. Nevertheless, he capped this final competition with a bronze medal.|$|E
500|$|Andretti competed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in four decades. In 1966 {{he shared}} a Holman Moody Ford MKII with Lucien Bianchi. They retired after their car dropped a valve at 10:30pm. In 1967, during a 3:30am pit stop, a {{mechanic}} inadvertently installed a front brake pad backward on his Ford MkIV. As Andretti passed under the Dunlop Bridge before the Esses, <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> brake pedal {{for the first}} time since leaving the pits. The front wheel instantly locked, turning the car hard into the dirt embankment at [...] The wreckage slid to a stop with Andretti badly shaken, the car sideways to oncoming traffic and the track nearly blocked. His teammates, Jo Schlesser and Roger McCluskey, crashed trying to avoid Andretti's car. McCluskey pulled Andretti to safety, and Andretti was taken to hospital for X-rays.|$|E
2500|$|If {{a player}} touches a hostile piece, then he must capture {{it if the}} piece can be captured. [...] If a player touches one of his pieces and an opponent's piece, he must make that capture {{if it is a}} legal move. [...] Otherwise, he is {{required}} to move or capture the first of the pieces that they touched. [...] If it cannot be determined whether <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> own piece or the opponent's piece first, it is assumed that <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> own piece first. [...] If a player touches more than one piece, he must move or capture the first piece that can be legally moved or captured. [...] An exception to that is an attempted illegal castling; in that case the king must be moved if possible, but otherwise there is no requirement to move the rook.|$|E
60|$|MATEY. Listen, Caroliny. (<b>He</b> <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> money pocket, which emits a crinkly sound--the squeak of angels.) That is {{what gets}} the ladies.|$|R
6000|$|... "And is he very bad, M. Henri?" [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> {{forehead}} with his finger. [...] "I suppose he cannot {{be all right}} there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beg pardon," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> cap to the ladies, [...] "but {{the rules}} are very strict aboard the Arabella. Will you please wait until I've taken this to the captain? Thank you!" ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{landing at}} Caval was a tense one {{though there was}} no fighting, Perry {{stationed}} sentries at the gates of the royal kraal to help with escape should it be necessary. Crack-O denied that his people had done anything wrong, so <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> ears and his tongue, with his sword, as a gesture of truthfulness. Governor Roberts asked Crack-O if he would attend the [...] "Great Palaver" [...] at Little Bereby and he accepted. Next Perry sailed his squadron for Little Bereby on December 11 and arrived on December 14 and landed his fifty marines and 150 sailors. The meeting was held in a house about fifty yards from the kraal gates, during which Roberts began discussing with Crack-O the Mary Carver and the Edward Barley affairs. It was apparent that the king was not telling the truth, so Commodore Perry stepped closer to Crack-O to advise him to stop lying and a scuffle ensued. The chief attempted to drag Perry to his spear, but the commodore threw off his attacker, who then left the house as fast as he could. But before getting out the door, a marine sergeant opened fire with his musket and hit the king while two others bayoneted him. Simultaneously the native interpreter ran {{out of the house and}} skirmishing erupted between the American sentries and some Bereby riflemen.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> chest; his long, slim {{fingers were}} folded upon it.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> hat-brim, {{and made}} a bow forward rather than in Mrs. Lapham's direction.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Yes, Mr. Ramornie,’ says <b>he,</b> <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> hat. ‘Begging your pardon, Mr. Ramornie. But I’ve {{been very}} piticular, sir, up to now; {{and you may}} trust me to be very piticular in the future. It were only a slip, sir.’ ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>touched</b> with <b>his</b> fingers {{a box of}} {{cigarettes}} which stood upon the tea-table.|$|R
50|$|Jesus {{does not}} explain any further, and they travel to Bethsaida where they come upon a blind man. He puts spit on the man's eyes and the man can {{partially}} see and then <b>he</b> <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> eyes again and he is totally healed. This miracle only occurs in Mark.|$|R
60|$|The King's face lightened, and <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> {{horse with}} the spur. But Brand hesitated.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> hat as he bade them farewell, {{and shook}} hands cordially with Major Bellenden.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> hat and turned. In {{a sort of}} dickey behind sat two gorgeous-turbaned Rajput servants.|$|E
60|$|She looked up, {{and would}} have cried out with astonishment, had <b>he</b> not <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> lips.|$|R
50|$|The next day, Zoidberg reattaches Fry's head to his now-repaired body, and {{everything}} returns to normal. Some of the nerves in Fry's neck were apparently rewired so that Fry's left leg hits him every time <b>he</b> <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> neck. As a result, Fry accidentally kicks Bender, and the robot's rear end explodes.|$|R
60|$|I uttered exclamations of joy. The {{inspector}} was as self-contained as a graven image. <b>He</b> calmly <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> bell.|$|R
60|$|The steward {{was still}} {{standing}} by, and <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> hat again, this time to Mrs. Cliff.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> {{right hand}} lightly, and I noticed {{for the first}} time that it was bandaged up.|$|E
60|$|Andrew {{was silent}} for a moment. <b>He</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> {{spectacles}} with a weary gesture, and covered his eyes with his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Carbonel, I believe," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> hat, {{almost a}} shovel. [...] "Will {{you do me}} the honour to {{introduce}} me to the ladies," [...] and to them he uncovered with the grand formal politeness which even then was becoming rather old-fashioned, and which they returned with curtsies, Sophia's, being fresh from the dancing-master, the most perfect of all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is you Mr. Hav'ley, sir?" [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> hat. [...] "Thought so; I'm the man {{in charge}} o' yer place. Got any baggage, sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So you're {{the young}} lady," [...] <b>he</b> remarked, <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> cap, [...] "who thinks that I come to sea with criminals stowed away on my ship?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Maccario {{laughed a}} little as <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. “There is a path here,” he said. “The Sin Verguenza have friends everywhere.” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> cap and stolidly set {{the car in}} motion. He {{seemed to}} have a league with her to ignore Skrebensky.|$|E
60|$|Maxwell {{generally}} {{frowned upon}} anything that approached the theatrical, but, as <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> comrade's glass with his own, {{his face was}} grave.|$|E
60|$|The ostler did not reply, {{neither did}} <b>he</b> <b>touch</b> <b>his</b> forelock in token of obedience. He smothered a yawn and with slow, {{dragging}} steps {{he led the}} over-tired mare toward the rough stabling in the rear. Gaston then turned toward the verandah and to the few wooden steps which {{led up to the}} doorway, wherein the apple-faced man still stood with his hands behind him, drowsily blinking at the unexpected visitor.|$|R
60|$|The moving shadow {{split into}} two shadows that stole closer, loomed before her. She could not tell which belonged to Jim till <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> her. <b>His</b> <b>touch</b> was potent. It seemed to {{electrify}} her.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Jesus is led before Pontius Pilate by a soldier. Pilate {{is asking}} {{questions}} {{as shown by}} the fact that <b>he</b> <b>touches</b> <b>his</b> thumb with his left index finger. On the left is the devil himself and next to the soldier the figure of Jesus without the crown of thorns. The image of the devil and of Jesus are best seen as apparitions looking in on the scene of Jesus before Pontius Pilate ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> hat {{and then}} withdrew, leaving Jane Merrick {{with a frown}} upon her brow that was not caused by his seeming impertinence.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{lives in}} your shadow," [...] {{answered}} Babalatchi, solemnly. [...] "It is enough!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> forehead {{and fell back}} to let Abdulla go first.|$|E
60|$|The {{nearness}} to her bred a madness, and <b>he</b> <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> lips lightly to {{the same}} white little toe that had won the Baron Courbertin a kiss.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, sir," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> hat as Frank came up. [...] "We {{are going}} to have a fine day, and the wind is likely to keep steady." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "B'soir, Monsieur le Colonel," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>touching</b> <b>his</b> skull-cap, [...] "the {{water is}} very low. You fren'," [...] he added, turning to me, [...] "he stay {{long time in}} St. Louis?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Ambrose Meadowcroft {{considered}} before <b>he</b> replied; <b>touched</b> <b>his</b> {{horse with}} the whip; {{looked at me}} with a certain sheepish hesitation; and suddenly burst out with the truth, in the plainest possible words: ...|$|R
