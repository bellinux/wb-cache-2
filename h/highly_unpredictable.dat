We note that NMF-NMF-SQ hashing also was shown to approximately follow a joint Gaussian distribution and a similar statement in terms of differential entropy was given in [16]. Hence, we state that the proposed FJLT hash is comparably as secure as NMF hashing, which was shown to be presumably more secure than previously proposed schemes {{that are based on}} random rectangles alone [16].|$|R
30|$|Media {{delivery}} CDN applications must accommodate <b>highly</b> transient, <b>unpredictable</b> users behaviour (arrival patterns, {{service time}} distributions, I/O system behaviours, user profile, network usage, etc.) and activities (streaming, searching, editing, and downloading). Yet many cloud providers contract service-level agreements which stipulate specific QoS targets, {{such as how}} fast a web page is served. It is therefore important to all parties that highly variable spikes in demand, caused by large number of simultaneous requests for a shared CDN service, do not degrade QoS[18, 19].|$|R

25|$|As {{with most}} cycling races, weather {{conditions}} {{have a significant}} influence {{in the nature of}} the day's race. In bad weather conditions, the race is often a grueling contest and the peloton is thinned out in the early parts of the race. In modern times, the edition of 1985 was hit by exceptionally stormy weather and only saw 24 finishers. When weather conditions are good, the teams of race favourites can control the race more easily and more riders are able to keep up with the pace. As the weather in April is <b>highly</b> <b>unpredictable</b> in Flanders, the race has repeatedly been affected by rough weather conditions.|$|E

[...] Occasionally, significant, accumulating snow can occur in October and April, though mild weather rapidly returns. [...] The springtime month of May is notably the sunniest month of the year.|$|E

[...] On May 18, 2016, CBS indicated that the new series would air in late 2016. In June 2016, however, the network scrapped the pilot and set Wan to direct the new pilot episode with Till and Eads remaining in the cast. Justin Hires was cast as Wilt Bozer, MacGyver's roommate. In July 2016, Variety reported that Sandrine Holt is cast as Patricia Thornton, an ex-field agent who is now director {{of operations for the}} Department of External Services. Also that Tristin Mays was cast as Riley Davis, a <b>highly</b> <b>unpredictable</b> computer hacker with a chip on her shoulder.

With some major exceptions of outright military rule, the Roman Republic remained an alliance of independent city-states and kingdoms (with varying degrees of independence, both de jure and de facto) until it transitioned into the Roman Empire.

40|$|Abstract — Service robots which {{directly}} {{interact with}} hu-mans in <b>highly</b> unstructured, <b>unpredictable</b> and dynamic envi-ronments {{must be able}} to flexibly adapt their motion in reaction to unforeseen events or obstacles and they must provide a new feasible trajectory in real-time. Hence, algorithms come into focus which replan the motion path and its time evolution from arbitrary initial conditions within milliseconds. We present a real-time algorithm to generate synchronised and time-optimal third-order manipulator trajectories complying maximal mo-tion limits on velocity, acceleration and jerk. Experimental results carried out on a Mitsubishi PA 10 - 7 C arm are presented. I...|$|R

40|$|Innovation and {{entrepreneurship}} {{are considered}} to be renewal, revitalisation and growth engines. However, their impact is <b>highly</b> uncertain, <b>unpredictable</b> and frustrating managers, who are pushed outside their comfort zones. Growth through Innovation explores how organisations typically confront reality and explains why they struggle with several dangerous myths. This book illustrates how you can do it differently by leveraging distinctive capabilities and by using an innovation lead compass. Basically, you will discover how to successfully reach your destination and influence your destiny. The author aspires to fill a critical gap in the existing literature by providing clear insights, simple diagnostic tools and techniques, unique strategies and practical steps...|$|R

40|$|Vehicle routing {{problems}} (VRP’s) involve assigning a {{fleet of}} limited capacity service vehicles to service a set of customers. This paper describes an innovative, agent-based approach to solving a real-world vehicle-routing problem embedded in a <b>highly</b> dynamic, <b>unpredictable</b> domain. Most VRP research, and all commercial products for solving VRP’s, make a static-world assumption, ignoring the dynamism in the real world. Our system is explicitly designed to address dynamism, and employs an in-time algorithm that quickly finds partial solutions to a problem, and improves these as time allows. Our fundamental innovation is a stochastic improvement mechanism that enables a distributed, agent-based system to achieve high-quality solutions {{in the absence of}} a centralized dispatcher...|$|R

5000|$|In {{artificial}} intelligence, reactive planning denotes a {{group of}} techniques for action selection by autonomous agents. These techniques differ from classical planning in two aspects. First, they operate {{in a timely fashion}} and hence can cope with <b>highly</b> dynamic and <b>unpredictable</b> [...] environments. Second, they compute just one next action in every instant, based on the current context. Reactive planners often (but not always) exploit reactive plans, which are stored structures describing the agent's priorities and behaviour.|$|R

The master does not need any knowledge of the cluster members of its cluster. This is a key feature of the overall mechanism as it minimizes the control load and facilitates its use in <b>highly</b> dynamic and <b>unpredictable</b> environments.|$|R
