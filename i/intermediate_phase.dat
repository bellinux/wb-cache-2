The resonant X-ray spectra of the five- and six-layer <b>intermediate</b> <b>phases</b> with predicted structure have also been calculated.

25|$|In {{continental}} arcs, {{such as the}} Andes, magma often {{pools in}} the shallow crust creating magma chambers. Magmas in these reservoirs become evolved in composition (dacitic to rhyolitic) through both the process of fractional crystallization and partial melting of the surrounding country rock. Over time as crystallization continues and the system loses heat, these reservoirs cool. In order to remain active, magma chambers must have continued recharge of hot basaltic melt into the system. When this basaltic material mixes with the evolved rhyolitic magma, the composition is returned to andesite, its <b>intermediate</b> <b>phase.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{method of}} the {{determining}} of the mutual diffusion coefficients in ternary <b>intermediate</b> <b>phases</b> is suggested. Methodology for {{determination of the}} interdiffusion coefficients of phases formed in a ternary diffusion couple in T-sample configuration is presented. The method requires only one annealing of the T-sample and {{makes it possible to}} calculate the matrix of the diffusion coefficients in the (CuNi) 6 Sn 5 and Cu 3 Sn ternary <b>intermediate</b> <b>phases</b> under low temperature. The concentration profiles and electron micrograph of the diffusion zone was obtained in the ternary Cu-Ni-Sn system annealed for 64 hours under 200 °C. Phase competition in this ternary system with special configuration of T-sample leads to lateral diffusion of Cu, to formation (CuNi) 6 Sn 5 compound between Ni-Sn side and to suppression of other NixSny <b>intermediate</b> <b>phases...</b>|$|R

Nacrite developed as euhedral, pseudohexagonal or elongated crystals within sandstones and thin, irregular veins.

The metamorphic conditions in which these minerals formed belong to anchizone, as can be deduced from the IC values. Dickite, nacrite and <b>intermediate</b> <b>phases</b> were studied by X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, differential thermal analysis and micros-copy.

40|$|A general phenomenological {{description}} {{and a simple}} molecular model is proposed for the 'discrete' flexoelectric effect in tilted smectic liquid crystal phases. This effect defines a polarization in a smectic layer induced by a difference of director orientations in the two smectic layers adjacent to it. It is shown that the 'discrete' flexoelectric effect is determined by electrostatic dipole-quadrupole interaction between positionally correlated molecules located in adjacent smectic layers, while the corresponding dipole-dipole interaction is responsible for a coupling between polarization vectors in neighboring layers. It is shown that a simple phenomenological model of a ferrielectric smectic liquid crystal, which has recently been proposed in the literature, {{can be used to}} describe the whole sequence of intermediate chiral smectic C* phases with increasing periods, and to determine the nonplanar structure of each phase without additional assumptions. In this sequence the phases with three- and four-layer periodicities have the same structure, as observed in the experiment. The theory predicts also the structure of <b>intermediate</b> <b>phases</b> with longer periods that have not been studied experimentally so far. The structures of <b>intermediate</b> <b>phases</b> with periodicities of up to nine layers are presented together with the phase diagrams, and a relationship between molecular chirality and the three-dimensional structure of <b>intermediate</b> <b>phases</b> is discussed.

2500|$|In the meantime, Veblen {{had made}} {{contacts}} {{with several other}} academics, such as Charles A. Beard, James Harvey Robinson, and John Dewey. The group of university professors and intellectuals eventually founded the New School for Social Research (known today as The New School) in 1919 as a modern, progressive, free school where students could “seek an unbiased understanding of the existing order, its genesis, growth, and present working". From 1919 to 1926, Veblen continued to write and maintain a role in The New School’s development. It was during this time that he wrote The Engineers and the Price System. In it, Veblen proposed a soviet of engineers. According to Yngve Ramstad, the view that engineers, not workers, would overthrow capitalism was a [...] "novel view". Veblen invited Guido Marx to the New School to teach and to help organize a movement of engineers, by such as Morris Cooke; Henry Laurence Gantt, who had died shortly before; and Howard Scott. Cooke and Gantt were followers of Taylor's Scientific Management. Scott, who listed Veblen as on the temporary organizing committee of the Technical Alliance, perhaps without consulting Veblen or other listed members, later helped found the Technocracy movement. Veblen had a penchant for socialism and believed that technological developments would eventually lead toward a socialistic organization of economic affairs. However, his views on socialism {{and the nature of}} the evolutionary process of economics differed sharply from that of Karl Marx; while Marx saw socialism as the final political precursor to communism, the ultimate goal for civilization, and saw the working class as the group that would establish it, Veblen saw socialism as one <b>intermediate</b> <b>phase</b> in an ongoing evolutionary process in society that would be brought about by the natural decay of the business enterprise system and by the inventiveness of engineers. Daniel Bell sees an affinity between Veblen and the Technocracy movement. Janet Knoedler and Anne Mayhew demonstrate the significance of Veblen's association with these engineers, while arguing that his book was more a continuation of his previous ideas than the advocacy others see in it.|$|E

It passes an Insurance Act to force him to provide himself with medicine; but it is avowedly indifferent to whether he is able to provide himself with meals. Thus while the sack is inconsistent with the family, the supervision is really inconsistent with the sack. The whole thing is a tangled chain of contradictions. It is true that in the special and sacred text of scripture we are here considering, the smoking is forbidden on a general and public and not on a medicinal and private ground.
