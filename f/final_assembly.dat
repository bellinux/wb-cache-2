5|$|Boeing built a <b>final</b> <b>assembly</b> line in Washington at its Renton factory, home of 707, 727, and 737 production, {{to produce}} the 757. Early in the {{development}} program, Boeing, British Airways, and Rolls-Royce unsuccessfully lobbied the British aircraft industry to manufacture 757 wings. Ultimately, {{about half of the}} aircraft's components, including the wings, nose section, and empennage, were produced in-house at Boeing facilities, and the remainder subcontracted to primarily U.S.-based companies. Fairchild Aircraft made the leading edge slats, Grumman supplied the flaps, and Rockwell International produced the main fuselage. Production ramp-up for the new narrow-body airliner coincided with the winding-down of the 727 program, and <b>final</b> <b>assembly</b> of the first aircraft began in January 1981.|$|E

5|$|To {{produce the}} 767, Boeing formed {{a network of}} {{subcontractors}} which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy's Aeritalia and Japan's CTDC. The wings and cabin floor were produced in-house, while Aeritalia provided control surfaces, Boeing Vertol made the leading edge for the wings, and Boeing Wichita produced the forward fuselage. The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies, namely Fuji Heavy Industries (wing fairings and gear doors), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (center fuselage), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (rear fuselage, doors, and tail). Components were integrated during <b>final</b> <b>assembly</b> at the Everett factory. For expedited production of wing spars, the main structural member of aircraft wings, the Everett factory received robotic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting fasteners. This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747. <b>Final</b> <b>assembly</b> of the first aircraft began in July 1979.|$|E

5|$|<b>Final</b> <b>assembly</b> for the A321 would be, as a {{first for}} any Airbus, carried out in Germany (then West Germany). This came after a dispute between the French, who claimed the move would incur $150million (€135 million) in {{unnecessary}} expenditure associated with the new plant, and the Germans, arguing {{it would be more}} productive for Airbus in the long run. The second production line was located at Hamburg, which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318. For the first time, Airbus entered the bond market, through which it raised $480million (€475 million) to finance development costs. An additional $180million (€175 million) was borrowed from European Investment Bank and private investors.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Russia {{submitted}} the Su-27M and Su-37 for South Korea's F-X programme, which sought a 40-aircraft {{replacement for the}} Republic of Korea Air Force's F-4D/Es, RF-4Cs and F-5E/Fs. The two Russian designs competed against the Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, and F-15K Slam Eagle. Sukhoi proposed a design which featured a phased-grid radar and thrust-vectoring engines, and offered full technology transfer as well as <b>final</b> <b>assembly</b> in South Korea. The US$5billion contract would have been partially financed through a debt-reduction deal on money Russia owed to South Korea. However, the Su-27M was eliminated early in the competition, which was won by the F-15K.|$|E
5|$|Prime {{contractor}} Lockheed Martin Aeronautics manufactured {{the majority}} of the airframe and performed <b>final</b> <b>assembly</b> at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia; program partner Boeing Defense, Space & Security provided additional airframe components as well as avionics integration and training systems. F-22 production was split up over many subcontractors across 46 states to increase Congressional support, though this production split may have contributed to increased costs and delays. Many capabilities were deferred to post-service upgrades, reducing the initial cost but increasing total program cost. Production supported over 1,000 subcontractors and suppliers and up to 95,000 jobs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{manufacturing}} process produces and supplies {{products to the}} distribution channels based on past forecasts. Manufacturing processes must be flexible in order to respond to market changes and must accommodate mass customization. Orders are processes operating on a just-in-time (JIT) basis in minimum lot sizes. Changes in the manufacturing flow process lead to shorter cycle times, meaning improved responsiveness and efficiency in meeting customer demand. This process manages activities related to planning, scheduling, and supporting manufacturing operations, such as work-in-process storage, handling, transportation, and time phasing of components, inventory at manufacturing sites, and maximum flexibility in the coordination of geographical and <b>final</b> <b>assemblies</b> postponement of physical distribution operations.|$|R

5|$|AMX-30 {{production}} {{occurred at}} the Atelier de Construction de Roanne {{in the town of}} Roanne. This heavy manufacturing factory was built during World War I to produce artillery shells, although by 1952 the factory had begun producing armoured fighting vehicles. Before producing the AMX-30, for example, it had made 1,900 AMX-13s and variants. The Roanne factory was responsible for <b>final</b> <b>assembly,</b> most components were made elsewhere: the powerplant by the Atelier de Construction de Limoges, the full armour set by the Ateliers et Forges de la Loire, the turret by the Atelier de Construction de Tarbes, the cannon by the Atelier de Construction de Bourges, the cupola and machine-gun by the Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-Étienne and the optics by the Atelier de Construction de Puteaux; all these again used many subcontractors. In a series of corporate mergers under state guidance, most of these firms would eventually be concentrated into GIAT.|$|E
40|$|Turing {{assemblers}} are Turing machines which {{operate on}} n-dimensional tapes under restrictions which characterize a procedure of assembly rather than computation, {{and which are}} intended as an abstraction of certain algorithmic processes of molecular biology. It has been previously shown that Turing assemblers with n-dimensional tapes can simulate arbitrary Turing machines for all n> 1. Here it is shown that for n= 1 even nondeterministic Turing assemblers have a sharply restricted computational capability, being able to successfully assemble only regular sets. The halting problem for linear Turing assemblers is therefore algorithmically solvable, and a characterization of the set of achievable <b>final</b> <b>assemblies</b> will be given as a subclass of the context-free languages...|$|R
40|$|The {{high-power}} {{laser beam}} in the <b>final</b> optics <b>assembly</b> of high-power laser facilities is often modulated by contamination particles, which may cause local high light intensity, thereby increasing the filamentary damage probability for optical components. To study the general design {{basis for a}} <b>final</b> optics <b>assembly</b> to decrease the risk of filamentary damage, different-sized contamination particles deposited on a component surface are simulated to modulate a 351 -nm laser beam based on the optical transmission theory, and the corresponding simulation results are analyzed statistically {{in terms of the}} propagation characteristic and the light field intensity distribution of the modulated laser beam. The statistical results show that component thickness and distance between components can to some extent be optimized to reduce the appearance of local high light intensity, and the general design basis of component thickness and arrangement are given for different control levels of particle sizes. Moreover, the statistical results can also predict the laser beam quality approximately under the existing optics design and environmental cleanliness. The optimized design for <b>final</b> optics <b>assembly</b> based on environmental cleanliness level is useful to prolong the lifetime of optics and enhance the output power of high-power laser facilities...|$|R
