5|$|Like all metal type revivals, {{reviving}} Gill Sans <b>in</b> <b>digital</b> <b>form</b> raises several {{decisions of}} interpretation, {{such as the}} issue of how to compensate for the ink spread that would have been seen in print at small sizes more than larger. As a result, printed Gill Sans and its digital facsimile may not always match. The digital release of Gill Sans, like many Monotype digitisations, has been criticised, in particular for excessively tight letter-spacing and lack of optical sizes: with only one design released that has to be used at any text size, it cannot replicate the subtlety of design and spacing of the metal type, for which every size was drawn differently. In the hot metal era the structure of the font varied by size as is normal for metal type, with wider spacing and other detail changes at smaller text sizes. In the phototype period Monotype continued to offer two or three sizes of master, but all of this subtlety was lost on transfer to digital. To replicate this, it is necessary to make manual adjustment to spacing to compensate for size changes, such as expanding the spacing and increasing the weight used at smaller sizes.|$|E

500|$|Conversion of Space Hulk into a {{video game}} was {{initiated}} in 1991 by video game company Electronics Arts, who also managed the project's development. [...] Instead of following Gremlin's approach and creating exact copies of the board games <b>in</b> <b>digital</b> <b>form,</b> Electronic Arts and Games Workshop opted to develop {{a video game}}, based on Space Hulk, with features that {{took advantage of the}} personal computer's technological advancements. [...] The interior walls of the space hulks were rendered by ray tracing, passing much of the graphical work to computers. [...] This method reduced the time needed to introduce new sets of walls into the game from two weeks to twelve hours. [...] Although digital speech was a relatively new technology at the time, the team made use of sound card technologies to produce alien screeches and roars that permeate the hulks, and warning cries from Marines under attack. [...] The game's opening tune, [...] "Get Out Of My Way", was recorded by British hard rock band D-Rok, with Brian May of Queen as guest guitarist. [...] Games Workshop helped Electronic Arts keep the game true to its Warhammer 40,000 roots by providing the writers with materials and answers on the fictional universe. [...] The development team created the tutorial missions, but adapted the other missions straight from the board game and the Deathwing Campaign expansion set.|$|E

500|$|Pearl Jam {{went on to}} tour Europe for {{its first}} time in six years. The band played a small secret show at the Astoria in London, and headlined the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2006, despite having vowed to never play at a festival again after Roskilde. In an {{interview}} {{in advance of the}} band's return to the festival circuit, Gossard commented, [...] "It seems like an era to trust that we're aware enough to get through those bigger shows. We have a heightened awareness of what needs to happen every night so people are as safe as they can possibly be." [...] Vedder started both concerts with an emotional plea to the crowd to look after each other. He commented during the Leeds set that the band's decision to play a festival for the first time after Roskilde {{had nothing to do with}} [...] "guts" [...] but with trust in the audience. On September 19, 2006, at the Torino, Italy show at Palaisozaki, Pearl Jam played Pearl Jam in its entirety in order midway through its set. After Europe, the band headed to Australia and then finished the year with two shows in Hawaii. The official bootlegs on this tour were available only <b>in</b> <b>digital</b> <b>form,</b> in both MP3 and lossless FLAC formats.
