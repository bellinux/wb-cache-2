500|$|In 1951, McCain {{enrolled}} at Episcopal High School in Alexandria, an academically superior, all-male private boarding {{school with a}} rigorous honor code, tradition of hazing, and spartan living environment. [...] Most of the children there were sons of wealthy Southerners, from whom McCain <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> life and career aspirations outside the Navy culture. [...] Nicknamed [...] "Punk" [...] and [...] "McNasty" [...] due to his combative, fiery disposition, McCain enjoyed and cultivated a tough guy image; he also made a few friends. [...] McCain earned two varsity letters in wrestling, excelling in the lighter weight classes. He also played on the junior varsity football team and the tennis team, and participated in the student newspaper, yearbook, and drama club. English teacher William Bee Ravenel III, who was also his football coach, became a great influence towards his sense of learning, honor, and self-image. [...] With what he later termed an [...] "undistinguished, but acceptable" [...] academic record, McCain {{graduated from high school}} in 1954.|$|E
60|$|The steamer {{disappointed}} us. Instead {{of making}} a long visit at Hobart, as usual, she made a short one. So we <b>got</b> but <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> Tasmania, and then moved on.|$|R
60|$|At {{that instant}} the clock {{of the city}} began to tell the hour of two, {{and it was only}} as that {{appointed}} signal sounded heavy and melancholy on the night-air, that the undeceived Camillo <b>got</b> <b>a</b> certain <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the truth.|$|R

We are goin' to beat Herne and play Place to a standstill." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2006, Phil Fontaine, National chief of the Assembly of First Nations, {{expressed}} disappointment over the Conservative government's refusal to honour the Kelowna Accord, endorsed by 14 jurisdictions (the federal government, 10 provinces, and three territories). Fontaine previously described the federal government's point person on Kelowna, Jim Prentice, as an [...] "honourable" [...] person sensitive to native concerns. Prior to January 2006 election, Fontaine and two vice-chiefs of the Assembly of First Nations {{had a meeting with}} Prentice. [...] " [...] acknowledged all the hard work that went into Kelowna and (said) that the Conservative party would not put this aside," [...] says Fontaine. [...] "We took him at his word." [...] Prentice did not recall saying that: [...] "I've always been very, very careful about what I've said about Kelowna," [...] According to Fontaine, in their first meeting after the 2006 election, [...] "(Prentice) wanted to apply a very focused approach to his responsibilities." [...] In the federal budget of May 2006, Fontaine and other native leaders <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> what [...] "focused" [...] meant: just $450 million (over two years) was committed to implementing Kelowna, not the $1.64 billion for the first two years that Paul Martin had agreed to.|$|E
2500|$|In 1911, {{he set out}} {{to build}} his first {{airplane}}, an airplane he named [...] "Silverwing". His first design was a monoplane, constructed of spruce and linen and which took the form of an American version of the Bleriot XI. The engine was a modified Elbridge motorboat motor, dubbed the [...] "aero special", which was a 2-stroke, 4-cylinder engine with a maximum of [...] and 1,050rpm. Upon completion, he sought to test the aircraft at the Great Salt Plains (adjacent to the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge) in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma. His first attempt at flight ended in a ground loop, which required $100 to repair. After repairs, Cessna attempted flight 13 more times, each time ending in some sort of failure. Finally on his 13th attempt, Cessna <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> hope as his aircraft bounced up into the air for a short time before crashing into the trees as he attempted to turn it. After his crash, Cessna exclaimed in frustration, [...] "I'm going to fly this thing, then I'm going to set it afire and never have another thing to do with aeroplanes!". Finally, in June 1911 Cessna had his first successful flight. The crowds that had scoffed at his failures changed their tone and began calling him a [...] "daring hero" [...] and nicknamed him the [...] "Birdman of Enid". Cessna continued to teach himself how to fly {{over the next several months}} until December 1911, when he made a successful [...] flight and a successful landing at the point of departure. He was the first person to build and fly an airplane in the Heartland of the United States—between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains.|$|E

60|$|I beard a {{crunching}} of gravel. Even as I wheeled I felt {{a tremendous}} {{pull on the}} lasso and I seemed to be sailing in the air. I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> blurred <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> Herky-Jerky leaning back on the taut lasso. Then I plunged down, slid over the rocks, and went souse into the spring.|$|R
6000|$|... "God forgive ye all, this deed, as I do!" [...] said Biddy, earnestly, and bending her person forward, she fell, as {{it might}} be [...] "without hands," [...] into the gulf of eternity. Though all {{strained}} their eyes, none of the men, Jack Tier excepted, ever saw more of Biddy Noon. Nor did Jack see much. He <b>got</b> <b>a</b> frightful <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> arm, however, on the summit of a wave, but the motion of the boat was too swift, and the water of the ocean too troubled, to admit of aught else.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{done wrong}} sleepin' here," [...] was his vindication. [...] "This ain't your property. It's agin the law. An' folks that go agin the law go to jail, {{as the two}} of you'll go. I've sent many a tramp up for thirty days for sleepin' in this very shack. Why, it's a regular trap for 'em. I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> good <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> your faces an' could see you was tough characters." [...] He turned on Billy. [...] "I've fooled enough with you. Are you goin' to give in an' come peaceable?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The news!" [...] exclaimed the major, {{as soon as}} he <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> his messenger. [...] "What mean these volleys, and how {{comes on}} my father in front?" ...|$|E

5000|$|The show began {{simply as}} [...] "Eat Bulaga! Indonesia", {{retaining}} {{much of the}} original segments and games played on the Philippine TV show, and premiered on SCTV on July 16, 2012.

6000|$|She rapped {{and entered}} promptly. As {{she did so}} her visitor moved quickly, so that she <b>got</b> but <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> white object disappearing behind the table. It would seem he was picking {{something}} from the floor. She rapped down the mustard pot on the table, and then she noticed the overcoat and hat had been taken off and put over a {{chair in front of}} the fire, and a pair of wet boots threatened rust to her steel fender. She went to these things resolutely. [...] "I suppose I may have them to dry now," [...] she said in a voice that brooked no denial.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed an}} age to Lucy, waiting there, until she did see horses zigzagging the ridges below. They disappeared, {{and then it}} was another age before they reappeared close under the bulge of wall. She thrilled at sight of Sage King and Sarchedon. She <b>got</b> only <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> them. They must pass round under her to climb a split in the wall, and up a long draw that reached level ground back in the forest. But they were near, and Lucy tried to wait. Creech showed eagerness at first, and then went on with his camp-fire duties. While in camp he always cooked a midday meal.|$|R
60|$|Sennit and I {{ran to the}} lee main-rigging, {{where we}} just <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the hat of the poor fellow, {{who seemed to be}} {{swimming}} manfully, as the ship foamed past him.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it, Nell?" [...] cried Ishmael, {{lifting his}} {{powerful}} voice a little above the rushing of the element. [...] "Have you <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> any thing {{bigger than a}} burrowing barker?" ...|$|E
60|$|It was in {{the highest}} degree important, also, that they remain hidden, for once the Indians <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the party {{it would be a}} simple matter to track them to the next hiding place.|$|E
5000|$|Looking for new employment, Waaske {{presented}} his compact camera to Ludwig Leitz and to Kodak, {{but to no}} avail. In January 1965 Waaske started working for Rollei in Braunschweig (Brunswyck). Having become Rollei's managing director only in March 1965, Heinrich Peesel accidentally <b>got</b> <b>a</b> first <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> his new employee's tiny prototype camera. Filled with enthusiasm, Peesel decided that the camera should immediately be further developed by Waaske for mass production, but, using only parts of Rollei's suppliers. Waaske's little camera was presented at photokina in 1966 as Rollei 35, with a better lens - the Zeiss Tessar 3.5/40mm lens, a state-of-the-art [...] CdS-exposure meter and a precision-made diaphragm shutter made by Compur, using Waaske's patented shutter design.|$|R
60|$|Ithuel, usually so loquacious and gossiping in his {{moments of}} leisure, was silent and observant {{when he had}} {{anything}} serious on hand. His eye {{was still on the}} window in which the lamp was visible, the pure olive oil that was burning in it throwing out a clear, strong flame; when suddenly a blue-light flashed beneath the place, and he <b>got</b> <b>a</b> momentary <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the body of the man who held it, as he leaned forward from another window. The motion which now turned his head seaward was instinctive; it was just in time to let him detect a light descending apparently into the water like a falling star; but which, in fact, was merely a signal lantern of the Proserpine coming rapidly down from the end of her gaff.|$|R
50|$|The Kentucky {{faithful}} finally <b>got</b> to see <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> {{what the}} new coaching staff {{had been working on}} since joining the Big Blue Nation with Stoops coming on board in late November. Stoops promised to bring a new approach to the defensive side of the ball with his offense revisiting a familiar style of play from air-raid era with an up-tempo offense. As the Wildcats put five passing touchdowns on the board, it marked the return of the old air raid sirens that once carried through the Lexington skies on game day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Blake agreed. [...] "I daresay {{we ought}} to find one in the hollow we <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> from the last rise, but we haven't {{had to put up}} with much {{discomfort}} yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] responded Otto, [...] "and {{the island}} {{on the other}} side must be a goodish big one, for I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> it through the trees as we came rushing in on that monstrous wave." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{only time}} I saw President John F. Kennedy in person {{was on the}} Monday before his Friday assassination. It was in Miami Beach, and the {{president}} was being driven in a motorcade to a speaking engagement. He was in the open limousine that became his death car four days later. The motorcade was moving at high speed [...] around 50 mph [...] and so I <b>got</b> only <b>a</b> fleeting <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> him, smiling and waving to the crowd, as the procession whizzed past...|$|R
6000|$|When one {{considers}} the conditions of its accumulation, one is not {{surprised to hear that}} the element of fiction is as dominant in this Deep Sea Library as it is upon the counters of Messrs. Mudie; but my cousin learnt that the various illustrated magazines, and particularly the fashion papers, are valued even more highly than novels, are looked for far more eagerly and perused with envious emotion. Indeed on that point my cousin <b>got</b> <b>a</b> sudden <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> one of the motives that had brought this daring young lady into the air. He made some sort of suggestion. [...] "We should have taken to dressing long ago," [...] she said, and added, with a vague quality of laughter in her tone, [...] "it isn't that we're unfeminine, Mr. Melville. Only--as I was explaining to Mrs. Bunting, one must consider one's circumstances--how can one hope to keep anything nice under water? Imagine lace!" ...|$|R
60|$|They quickly {{cleared the}} down, and Anne became {{conscious}} {{that the course}} of the horse was homeward. As soon as the ground began to rise towards the outer belt of upland which lay between her and the coast, Champion, now panting and reeking with moisture, lessened his speed in sheer weariness, and proceeded at a rapid jolting trot. Anne felt that she could not hold on half so well; the gallop had been child's play compared with this. They were in a lane, ascending to a ridge, and she made up her mind for a fall. Over the ridge rose an animated spot, higher and higher; {{it turned out to be}} the upper part of a man, and the man to be a soldier. Such was Anne's attitude that she only <b>got</b> <b>an</b> occasional <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> him; and, though she feared that he might be a Frenchman, she feared the horse more than the enemy, as she had feared Festus more than the horse. Anne had energy enough left to cry, 'Stop him; stop him!' as the soldier drew near.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wasn't {{that a great}} {{letter from}} the boy?" [...] began Anderson, as he lit a cigar. By the flash of the match Lenore <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> his dark and {{unguarded}} face. Indeed, she did well to fortify herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt, Sir, no doubt. I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> {{his lower}} dead-eyes, a minute ago; but I have been {{near enough to}} see the saucy look of the hussy under his bowsprit; yet there goes the brigantine, at large!" ...|$|E
60|$|The earl drifted {{here and}} there through the {{swarming}} lobby, and finally took a waiting position {{in the neighborhood of}} the elevator. During an hour crowds went up and crowds came down; and all complete as to limbs; but at last the watcher <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> a figure that was satisfactory-- <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the back of it, though he had missed his chance at the face through waning alertness. The glimpse revealed a cowboy hat, and below it a plaided sack of rather loud pattern, and an empty sleeve pinned up to the shoulder. Then the elevator snatched the vision aloft and the watcher fled away in joyful excitement, and rejoined the fellow-conspirator.|$|E
60|$|If Mrs. Rindge had a girlish {{air when}} fully arrayed for the day, she looked {{younger and more}} angular still in that article of attire known as a {{dressing}} gown. And her eyes, Honora remarked, were peculiarly bright: glittering, perhaps, would better express the impression they gave; as though one <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> through them <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inward consuming fire. Her laughter rang shrill and clear as Honora entered the hall by the rear door, and the big clock proclaimed that the hour was half-past eleven. Hugh and Mr. Pembroke were standing {{at the foot of}} the stairs, gazing upward. And Honora, following their glances, beheld the two ladies, in the negligee referred to above, with their elbows on the railing of the upper hall and their faces between their hands, engaged in a lively exchange of compliments with the gentlemen. Mrs. Kame looked sleepy.|$|R
40|$|The Strangers of New Bell’ {{offers the}} reader a {{textured}} and nuanced view of colonial Douala, {{and more specifically}} of the strangers’ quarter of New Bell, as the author analyzes the city through innovative lenses and interdisciplinary frames without losing intellectual rigor. In this book, Schler accurately shows the important role and agency of immigrants {{in the history of}} African cities and, more general, the colonial encounter, without falling into the commonplace representation of African cities as sites of chaos and struggle. The attempt of Schler to include a ‘history of places’ in this analysis of colonial New Bell, however, has been accomplished with varying success, probably causing the feeling that, while this book provides an excellent image of the society of strangers of New Bell, we <b>got</b> only <b>a</b> small <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> its physical configuration...|$|R
5000|$|A {{supporter}} of Mahatma Gandhi's demand for Indian independence from British rule, Madhur {{spent some time}} each day spinning khadi and delivered several large spools of thread to a central collection center in Delhi.In 1947, Madhur experienced first-hand {{the effects of the}} partition of the British Indian Empire. At school, her classmates split into two on the issue of partition; the Muslim girls supported the idea while the Hindus were against it. On August 15 she watched the transfer of power at India Gate and <b>got</b> <b>a</b> clear <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> Jawaharlal Nehru and Lord Mountbatten coming down Rajpath in an open horse carriage. The massive multi-directional migration that began almost immediately afterwards caused riots and killing in Delhi. The male members of her family guarded their house with guns that they had previously used only for hunting game. At school, all her Muslim classmates left without a farewell. In 1948, a few days before Mahatma Gandhi was shot dead, she attended one of his prayer meetings at Birla House and sang bhajans. She heard the news of his assassination on the radio, followed by Jawaharlal Nehru's address later that night, [...] "the light has gone out of our lives, and there is darkness everywhere." [...] She saw Gandhi's funeral procession at Rajpath and witnessed his cremation at Rajghat.|$|R
