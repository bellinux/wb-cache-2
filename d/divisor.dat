5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} calculates {{the greatest}} common <b>divisor</b> (GCD) of two natural numbers a and b. The greatest common <b>divisor</b> g {{is the largest}} natural number that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder. Synonyms for the GCD include the greatest common factor (GCF), the highest common factor (HCF), the highest common <b>divisor</b> (HCD), and the greatest common measure (GCM). The greatest common <b>divisor</b> is often written as gcd(a,b) or, more simply, as (a,b), although the latter notation is also used for other mathematical concepts, such as two-dimensional vectors.|$|E
5|$|Let g = gcd(a,b). Since a and b {{are both}} {{multiples}} of g, {{they can be}} written a=mg and b=ng, {{and there is no}} larger number G>g for which this is true. The natural numbers m and n must be coprime, since any common factor could be factored out of m and n to make g greater. Thus, any other number c that divides both a and b must also divide g. The greatest common <b>divisor</b> g of a and b is the unique (positive) common <b>divisor</b> of a and b that is divisible by any other common <b>divisor</b> c.|$|E
5|$|The {{validity}} of the Euclidean algorithm can be proven by a two-step argument. In the first step, the final nonzero remainder r'N−1 is shown to divide both a and b. Since {{it is a common}} <b>divisor,</b> it must be {{less than or equal to}} the greatest common <b>divisor</b> g. In the second step, it is shown that any common <b>divisor</b> of a and b, including g, must divide r'N−1; therefore, g must be less than or equal to r'N−1. These two conclusions are inconsistent unless r'N−1 = g.|$|E

For any loop L we give conditions on L so that the loop ring Z 2 L has S-zero <b>divisors</b> and S-weak zero <b>divisors.</b> This paper has four sections.

5|$|The GCD can be visualized as follows. Consider a {{rectangular}} area a by b, and any common <b>divisor</b> c that divides both a and b exactly. The {{sides of the}} rectangle {{can be divided into}} segments of length c, which divides the rectangle into a grid of squares of side length c. The greatest common <b>divisor</b> g is the largest value of c for which this is possible. For illustration, a 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common <b>divisor</b> of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of 12-by-12 squares, with two squares along one edge (24/12=2) and five squares along the other (60/12=5).|$|E

5|$|Another {{definition}} of the GCD is helpful in advanced mathematics, particularly ring theory. The greatest common <b>divisor</b> g of two nonzero numbers a and b is also their smallest positive integral linear combination, that is, the smallest positive number of the form ua+vb where u and v are integers. The set of all integral linear combinations of a and b is actually {{the same as the}} set of all multiples of g (mg, where m is an integer). In modern mathematical language, the ideal generated by a and b is the ideal generated byg alone (an ideal generated by a single element is called a principal ideal, and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals). Some properties of the GCD are in fact easier to see with this description, for instance the fact that any common <b>divisor</b> of a and b also divides the GCD (it divides both terms of ua+vb). The equivalence of this GCD definition with the other definitions is described below.|$|E

5|$|The GCD of two numbers a and b is {{the product}} of the prime factors shared by the two numbers, where a same prime factor can be used {{multiple}} times, but only as long as the product of these factors divides both a and b. For example, since 1386 can be factored into 2×3×3×7×11, and 3213 can be factored into 3×3×3×7×17, the greatest common <b>divisor</b> of 1386 and 3213 equals 63=3×3×7, the product of their shared prime factors. If two numbers have no prime factors in common, their greatest common <b>divisor</b> is 1 (obtained here as an instance of the empty product), in other words they are coprime. A key advantage of the Euclidean algorithm is that it can find the GCD efficiently without having to compute the prime factors. Factorization of large integers is believed to be a computationally very difficult problem, and the security of many widely used cryptographic protocols is based upon its infeasibility.|$|E
