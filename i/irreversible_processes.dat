40|$|In thermodynamics, {{there exists}} a {{conventional}} belief that "the Carnot efficiency is reachable only when a process is reversible. " However, there is no theorem proving that the Carnot efficiency is unattainable in an <b>irreversible</b> <b>process.</b> Here, we show that the Carnot efficiency is reachable in an <b>irreversible</b> <b>process</b> through investigation of the Feynman-Smoluchowski ratchet (FSR). We also show {{that it is possible}} to enhance the efficiency by increasing the irreversibility. Our result opens a new possibility of designing an efficient heat engine in a highly <b>irreversible</b> <b>process</b> and also answers the long-standing question of whether the FSR can operate with the Carnot efficiency.

25|$|Hence, when a {{shock wave}} passes through matter, energy is {{preserved}} but entropy increases. This {{change in the}} matter's properties manifests itself as {{a decrease in the}} energy which can be extracted as work, and as a drag force on supersonic objects; shock waves are strongly <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Statistical {{mechanics}} {{also finds}} use outside equilibrium. An important subbranch known as non-equilibrium statistical mechanics {{deals with the}} issue of microscopically modelling the speed of <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes</b> that are driven by imbalances. Examples of such processes include chemical reactions or flows of particles and heat. Unlike with equilibrium, there is no exact formalism that applies to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics in general, and so this branch of statistical mechanics remains an active area of theoretical research.|$|E
25|$|While Clausius {{based his}} {{definition}} on a reversible process, {{there are also}} <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes</b> that change entropy. Following the second law of thermodynamics, entropy of an isolated system always increases. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may not flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes</b> {{that result in}} an {{increase}} of the entropy. See: Entropy production. One of them is mixing {{of two or more}} different substances, occasioned by bringing them together by removing a wall that separates them, keeping the temperature and pressure constant. The mixing is accompanied by the entropy of mixing. In the important case of mixing of ideal gases, the combined system does not change its internal energy by work or heat transfer; the entropy increase is then entirely due to the spreading of the different substances into their new common volume.|$|E
25|$|In principle, non-equilibrium {{statistical}} mechanics could be mathematically exact: ensembles for an isolated system evolve over time according to deterministic equations such as Liouville's equation or its quantum equivalent, the von Neumann equation. These equations {{are the result}} of applying the mechanical equations of motion independently to each state in the ensemble. Unfortunately, these ensemble evolution equations inherit much of the complexity of the underlying mechanical motion, and so exact solutions are very difficult to obtain. Moreover, the ensemble evolution equations are fully reversible and do not destroy information (the ensemble's Gibbs entropy is preserved). In order to make headway in modelling <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes,</b> it is necessary to consider additional factors besides probability and reversible mechanics.|$|E

2500|$|The 19th-century Austrian {{physicist}} Ludwig Boltzmann first {{recognized that}} the struggle for existence of living organisms was neither over raw material nor energy, but instead {{had to do with}} entropy production derived from the conversion of the solar spectrum into heat by these systems. Boltzmann thus realized that living systems, like all <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes,</b> were dependent on the dissipation of a generalized chemical potential for their existence. In his book “What is Life”, the 20th-century Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger emphasized the importance of Boltzmann’s deep insight into the irreversible thermodynamic nature of living systems, suggesting that this was the physics and chemistry behind the origin and evolution of life. However, <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes,</b> and much less living systems, could not be conveniently analyzed under this perspective until Lars Onsager, and later Ilya Prigogine, developed an elegant mathematical formalism for treating the “self-organization” of material under a generalized chemical potential. This formalism became known as Classical Irreversible Thermodynamics and Prigogine was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977 [...] "for his contributions to non-equilibrium thermodynamics, particularly the theory of dissipative structures". The analysis of Prigogine showed that if a system were left to evolve under an imposed external potential, material could spontaneously organize (lower its entropy) forming what he called “dissipative structures” which would increase the dissipation of the externally imposed potential (augment the global entropy production). Non-equilibrium thermodynamics has since been successfully applied to the analysis of living systems, from the biochemical production of ATP [...] to optimizing bacterial metabolic pathways [...] to complete ecosystems.|$|E
2500|$|The {{androgenic}} {{effects of}} AAS are numerous.

Effects on women include deepening of the voice, facial hair growth, and possibly a decrease in breast size. Men may develop an enlargement of breast tissue, known as gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and a reduced sperm count.|$|E

2500|$|For example, gas in a {{container}} with known volume, pressure, and energy could have {{an enormous number of}} possible configurations of the collection of individual gas molecules. [...] At equilibrium, each instantaneous configuration of the gas may be regarded as random. Entropy may be understood as a measure of [...] disorder within a macroscopic system. The second law of thermodynamics states that an isolated system's entropy never decreases. Such systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems may lose entropy, provided [...] their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount. Since entropy {{is a function of the}} state of the system, a change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. This applies whether the process is reversible or irreversible. However, <b>irreversible</b> <b>processes</b> increase the combined entropy of the system and its environment.|$|E
