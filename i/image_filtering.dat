40|$|Separable <b>image</b> <b>filter</b> is a {{subclass}} of convolutional <b>image</b> <b>filters</b> {{that are}} used widely. The coefficients {{of these types of}} <b>image</b> <b>filters</b> can be determined with training images using heuristic approaches as well as analytical methods. In this study, comparative analyses were realized for separable and non-separable <b>image</b> <b>filters</b> that were trained using genetic algorithms. The results for training durations and performance analyses are presented comparatively for various size of kernels. According to the results, the training durations of the separable <b>image</b> <b>filter</b> is shorter due to smaller number of coefficients and hence smaller number of multiplication and addition operations. On the other hand, when compared in terms of quality, non-separable filter shows better results. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Image</b> <b>filtering</b> (band pass filtering) {{is often}} used to reduce the {{influence}} of high and/or low spatial frequency information in the images, which can affect the results of the alignment and classification procedures. This is particularly useful in negative stain images. The algorithms make use of fast Fourier transforms (FFT), often employing gaussian shaped soft-edged masks in reciprocal space to suppress certain frequency ranges. High-pass filters remove low spatial frequencies (such as ramp or gradient effects), leaving the higher frequencies intact. Low-pass filters remove high spatial frequency features and have a blurring effect on fine details.|$|E

50|$|Mail filters have {{varying degrees}} of configurability. Sometimes they make {{decisions}} based on matching a regular expression. Other times, code may match keywords in the message body, or perhaps the email address of the sender of the message. More complex control flow and logic is possible with programming languages; this is typically implemented with a data-driven programming language, such as procmail, which specifies conditions to match and actions to take on matching, which may involve further matching. Some more advanced filters, particularly anti-spam filters, use statistical document classification techniques such as the naive Bayes classifier. <b>Image</b> <b>filtering</b> can use complex image-analysis algorithms to detect skin-tones and specific body shapes normally associated with pornographic images.|$|E
