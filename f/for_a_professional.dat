5|$|As a scout for the Houston Astros, Hal Newhouser {{evaluated}} Jeter extensively {{before the}} 1992 MLB draft. The Astros held the first overall {{pick in the}} draft, and Newhouser, convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team, lobbied team management to select him. The Astros feared that Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>professional</b> contract, so they passed on him, instead choosing Cal State Fullerton outfielder Phil Nevin, who signed with Houston for $700,000. Newhouser felt so strongly about Jeter's potential that he quit his job with the Astros in protest after they ignored his drafting advice.|$|E
5|$|As a young boy, Graf {{was an avid}} {{football}}er. He {{started with}} his local football club DJK Engen and later became a goalkeeper at FC Höhen. In his teens, he was selected to join a group of talented young players trained by Sepp Herberger. Herberger was a forward in the German national team from 1921–25, and later {{head coach of the}} German 1954 FIFA World Cup-winning team. However, a broken thumb ended Graf's early hopes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>professional</b> football career.|$|E
5|$|In 1928 Constantine {{had signed}} an initial three-year {{contract}} with Nelson, {{to play in}} the Lancashire League. The contract was worth £500 per season, plus performance bonuses and travelling expenses. He remained there until 1937, an unusually long time <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>professional</b> to remain with one club. Constantine's appearances boosted attendances and gate receipts for all Nelson's matches, and was of great financial benefit to both the club and the League as a whole. In Constantine's nine seasons at the club, Nelson never finished lower than second, won the league competition seven times and the knockout cup twice. In 1931 Constantine renewed his contract for £650 per season; when in 1935 a rival league attempted to sign him, all the Lancashire League clubs contributed to his wage, which rose to £750 per year between 1935 and 1937. This was far more than the then maximum wage <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>professional</b> footballer of £386, or the £500 per season that a top county cricketer could potentially earn, and possibly made Constantine the best-paid sportsman in the country. Consequently, he and his family enjoyed a good standard of living {{for the first time in}} their lives.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} against Barcelona, Lehmann was sent off in 18th minute <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>professional</b> foul on striker Samuel Eto'o.

Henry missed a chance in the second half to give Arsenal a two-nil lead before Eto'o equalised with 14 minutes left. Substitute Henrik Larsson set up Juliano Belletti to score the winner for Barcelona. Wenger criticised referee Terje Hauge for sending off Lehmann, a view shared by club captain Henry and FIFA president Sepp Blatter.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-finals, Boro faced Arsenal, {{the leaders}} and {{eventual}} unbeaten {{champions of the}} Premier League season. In the first leg at Highbury on 20 January 2004, Queudrue exploited a mistake by Arsenal defender Martin Keown and passed to Mendieta, who then assisted Juninho for the only goal of the game. On 3 February, Boro hosted Arsenal in the second leg; Keown was sent off {{at the end of}} the first half <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>professional</b> foul on Maccarone. In the second half, Boudewijn Zenden put Middlesbrough ahead and Edu equalised.

Blackpool finished seventh in 1949–50, and though they were never title contenders vast crowds still turned out home and away to witness the entertaining football they displayed. At this time he received the maximum wage allowed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>professional</b> player – £12 a week.|$|E

5|$|The brawl {{started after}} the hour mark; Winterburn made a lunging tackle on Irwin, who was {{challenging}} Limpar for the ball. McClair and Irwin retaliated against Winterburn and Limpar, whom Ince pushed onto the advertising hoardings. All 11 United players and 10 Arsenal players on the pitch partook in the melee (goalkeeper David Seaman was the only player to remain uninvolved), though most were attempting to calm the situation. The fracas lasted less than 20 seconds; once it died down, Hackett booked Limpar and Winterburn for their involvement, while the United players escaped punishment. Tony Adams, praised by The Guardian correspondent Stephen Bierley {{for his role in}} defusing matters, avoided a caution <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>professional</b> foul on McClair later on.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round, receiving a bye as a Premier League club. Their opening match was a 2–0 home win against Oxford United on 4 January 2003. Bergkamp scored his 100th goal for the club and an own goal by defender Scott McNiven ensured progression to the next round. Arsenal faced non-league side Farnborough Town but the match switched from Farnborough's ground at Cherrywood Road to Highbury due to concerns over safety. Farnborough as the home team began the match in disastrous fashion, conceding a goal scored by Campbell in the 19th minute, and going down to ten men after Christian Lee was sent off <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>professional</b> foul. Francis Jeffers scored twice before Rocky Baptiste added a consolation, beating Cygan for pace and despite having his first shot saved by goalkeeper Taylor, he managed to lift the ball over him and into the net. Lauren and Bergkamp each scored in the final 15 minutes to give Arsenal a 5–1 victory.|$|E
