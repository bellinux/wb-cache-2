40|$|<b>Intestinal</b> <b>mucosal</b> {{immunoglobulin}} <b>secretion</b> {{in vitro}} {{has been studied}} by culture of endoscopic biopsy tissues obtained from various sites along the gastrointestinal tract. IgA and IgM were the predominant immunoglobulins produced by intestinal tissues distal to the stomach and secretion of both reached a maximum in the small intestine of normal individuals. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, characteristic alterations in immunoglobulin production were observed in cultures of large intestinal tissue. In ulcerative colitis (UC), significant reductions in IgA secretion (P less than 0. 03) occurred in the rectum during remission and IgM in the colon in active disease (P less than 0. 01). However, in active Crohn's disease (CD), rectal IgM secretion was enhanced (P less than 0. 004) and IgA diminished (P less than 0. 01). IgG secretion was increased throughout the colon in UC especially in distal sites, due largely to significant increases in pre-formed immunoglobulin (P less than 0. 02). Similar total increases were observed in colonic tissues from patients with CD, although IgG synthesis in biopsies from rectal sites was normal. These findings suggest that specific abnormalities of <b>intestinal</b> <b>mucosal</b> immunoglobulin synthesis occur in patients with both UC and CD...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} idea of using diet for health maintenance. Not only does dietary intake determine the availability of substrates for host metabolism, but it can also shape the composition of the intestinal microbiota, increasingly recognised as an ‘organ’ in its own right, which closely interacts with the mucosal immune system. Alterations in the mammalian-microbial-metabolic axis are associated with disease development and as such it is important to study the systemic consequences of dietary intervention on these interactions in an appropriate animal model such as the pig. The majority of the abundant metabolites present in porcine liver, kidney, serum and urine were assigned by one and two dimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and qualitatively compared; inter-compartmental differences in relation to mammalian-microbial co-metabolic representation were identified in the pig, and the applicability of NMR-based urinalysis to interrogate mammalian-microbial co-metabolism in this species confirmed. The initial weaning diet of pigs was found to initiate sustainable metabolic reprogramming in the young pig, leading to a persistent urinary metabolic signature after four weeks; this signature included metabolites linked to microbial metabolic processes and could indicate a diet-induced microbial reprogramming event at weaning. Differences in the initial weaning diet were also found to impact the metabolic and immunologic consequences of Bifidobacterium lactis supplementation on the young pig. The urinary metabolic profile from these animals was significantly correlated with patterns of <b>intestinal</b> <b>mucosal</b> immunoglobulin <b>secretion</b> and thus indicates the potential utility of biofluid-based metabolic profiling to assess mucosal responses to dietary intervention.

T 84 cells were incubated with TxA (100 ng/ml) in medium with or without glutamine or alanyl-glutamine (3 to 100 mM). Apoptosis was evaluated by DNA fragmentation in vitro and the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling method in vivo.

Detection,prevention and treatment of <b>intestinal</b> <b>mucosal</b> hypoperfusion are therefore important forprevention of complications in critically ill patients. In this thesis, the intestinal mucosalperfusion, measured by laser Doppler flowmetry, has been studied during and after cardiacsurgery and in critically ill patients with vasodilatory shock, with focus on the effects ofvasopressor treatment. The <b>intestinal</b> <b>mucosal</b> perfusion was evaluated postoperatively in eighteen cardiac surgerypatients.

In this study, using intestinal epithelial cells under anaerobic cultivation and an in vivo rat intestinal I/R model, we found that hypoxia and I/R increased the expression of BMP 2 / 4 and upregulated BMP type Ia receptor and BMP type II receptor expression. We also found that exogenous BMP 2 / 4 can activate the ERK and AKT signaling pathways in rat small intestine (IEC- 6) cells, thereby activating NF-κB signaling, which leads to increased levels of inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α and IL- 6. Furthermore, recombinant BMP 2 / 4 decreased {{the expression of the}} tight junction protein occludin via the activation of the NF-κB pathway; these effects were abolished by treatment with the BMP-specific antagonist noggin or the NF-κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC).

40|$|Gastric acid is an {{important}} factor in the digestive process but it is also a potential threat to the gastroduodenal mucosa. Several mechanisms act in concert to resist this aggressive challenge, one of them being the neutralising <b>mucosal</b> <b>secretion</b> of bicarbonate into an unstirred mucus layer covering the surface epithelium. An extended knowledge of the regulatory principles involved in the regulation of duodenal <b>mucosal</b> alkaline <b>secretion</b> is of great interest, as they may help to clarify the obscure pathophysiology behind common gastroduodenal disorders, like acid-related dyspepsia, with or without concomitant mucosal disease. The general aim of this thesis was to elucidate sympatho-adrenergic inhibition of duodenal <b>mucosal</b> alkaline <b>secretion</b> and to investigate possible interactions with the renin-angiotensin system. Effects on duodenal morphological integrity of luminal acid exposure during sympatho-inhibition of <b>mucosal</b> alkaline <b>secretion</b> were also investigated. Duodenal <b>mucosal</b> alkaline <b>secretion</b> was measured by an in vivo pH-stat technique on isolated duodenal segments in anaesthetised rats. Sympathetic outflow was increased by modest blood loss or electrical stimulation of the splanchnic nerves. The renin-angiotensin system was interfered with pharmacologically. Duodenal mucosal damage was assessed by both light and scanning electron microscopy. The investigation suggests that the sympatho-adrenergic inhibitory effect on duodenal <b>mucosal</b> alkaline <b>secretion</b> is not mediated directly at the epithelial cells, rather via activation of secretomotor neurons of the enteric nervous system. Furthermore, the renin-angiotensin system, probably by activation of peripheral angiotensin II type- 1 receptors, prolongs the sympatho-adrenergic inhibition of duodenal <b>mucosal</b> alkaline <b>secretion.</b> On the other hand, activation of angiotensin II type- 2 receptors located in the duodenal wall stimulates duodenal <b>mucosal</b> alkaline <b>secretion.</b> An inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme increases duodenal <b>mucosal</b> alkaline <b>secretion</b> mainly via a bradykinin-dependent pathway, not related to the inhibition of the angiotensin II synthesis.

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: In the intestines, Toll-like {{receptor}} 2 (TLR 2) mediates immune {{responses to}} pathogens and regulates epithelial barrier function; polymorphisms in TLR 2 {{have been associated}} with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) phenotype. We assessed the effects of TLR 2 signaling on the enteric nervous system (ENS) in mice. METHODS: TLR 2 distribution and function in the ileal neuromuscular layer of mice were determined by immunofluorescence, cytofluorimetric analysis, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses. We assessed morphology and function of the ENS in Tlr 2 -/- mice and in mice with wild-type Tlr 2 (wild-type mice) depleted of intestinal microbiota, using immunofluorescence, immunoblot, and gastrointestinal motility assays. Levels and signaling of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were determined using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunoprecipitation analyses. Colitis was induced by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) or 2, 4 dinitrobenzensulfonic acid (DNBS) to Tlr 2 -/- mice after termination of GDNF administration. RESULTS: TLR 2 was expressed in enteric neurons, glia, and smooth muscle cells of the intestinal wall. Tlr 2 -/- mice had alterations in ENS architecture and neurochemical profile, <b>intestinal</b> dysmotility, abnormal <b>mucosal</b> <b>secretion,</b> reduced levels of GDNF in smooth muscle cells, and impaired signaling via Ret-GFRα 1. ENS structural and functional anomalies were completely corrected by administration of GDNF to Tlr 2 -/- mice. Wild-type mice depleted of intestinal microbiota had ENS defects and GDNF deficiency, similar to Tlr 2 -/- mice; these defects were partially restored by administration of a TLR 2 agonist. Tlr 2 -/- mice developed more severe colitis than wild-type mice following administration of DSS or DNBS; colitis was not more severe if Tlr 2 -/- mice were given GDNF before DSS or DNBS. CONCLUSIONS: In mice, TLR 2 signaling regulates intestinal inflammation by controlling ENS structure and neurochemical coding, along with intestinal neuromuscular function. These findings provide information as to how a defective TLR 2 signaling in the ENS affects IBD phenotype in humans...|$|R
