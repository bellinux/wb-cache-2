O.B. rushed to Max's side and held him, soon after he died in O.B.'s arms and Steph arrived too late to say goodbye. Steph was overwhelmed with grief, and refused to leave her flat she shared with Max or wouldn't take off her wedding dress, until a visit from the priest helps her to face up to her responsibilities for Tom.

5|$|The {{battle was}} at a {{stalemate}} {{for the next five}} or six hours, with all the participants immobilized. Bonnet's men had the advantage that their deck was heeled away from their opponents, giving them cover, while the Henrys deck was tilted toward the pirates, thus exposing Rhett's men to punishing musket volleys. Bonnet's force suffered twelve casualties while killing ten and wounding fourteen of Rhett's 70-man crew. Most of Bonnet's men fought enthusiastically, challenging their enemies to board and fight hand to hand, and tying a <b>knot</b> <b>in</b> their flag as a mock signal to come aboard and render aid. Bonnet himself patrolled the deck with a pistol drawn, threatening to kill any pirate who faltered in the fight. Nevertheless, some of the prisoners who had been forced to join the pirate crew refused to fire on Rhett's men, and one narrowly escaped death at Bonnet's hands in the confusion of the engagement.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. We study Legendrian <b>knots</b> <b>in</b> a cabled <b>knot</b> type. Specifically, given a topological knot type K, we {{analyze the}} Legendrian <b>knots</b> <b>in</b> <b>knot</b> types {{obtained}} from K by cabling, {{in terms of}} Legendrian <b>knots</b> <b>in</b> the <b>knot</b> type K. As a corollary of this analysis, we show that the (2, 3) -cable of the (2, 3) -torus knot is not transversely simple and moreover classify the transverse <b>knots</b> <b>in</b> this <b>knot</b> type. This is the first classification of transverse <b>knots</b> <b>in</b> a non-transversely-simple <b>knot</b> type.
