40|$|INTRODUCTION: Dysbaric osteonecrosis {{is a rare}} {{illness in}} {{professional}} divers and compressed-air workers. The correlation between dysbaric osteonecrosis and previous decompression sickness with osteoarthromuscular pain (type 1 decompression sickness) remains a controversial subject. The probability for ischemic lesions detected with MRI to turn into osteonecrosis after decompression sickness is still not established. EXEGESIS: The authors report {{the case of a}} military diver declared definitely medically unfit to dive after the occurrence of advanced dysbaric osteonecrosis of the shoulder, eight months after decompression sickness treated with hyperbaric oxygen, in the same area. A close link between those two events and the requirement for monitoring the follow-up of acute type 1 decompression sickness are discussed. CONCLUSION: Every decompression sickness with osteoarthromuscular pain should be early examined with MRI in order <b>to</b> screen osteomedullar <b>damages</b> <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> worse with diving and change subsequently in bone necrosis...|$|R

Urban areas have become increasingly complex socio-technical systems where the inextricable tangle of activities, networks and regions means disruptions propagate rather than disseminate. In risk anticipation, measures of prevention and anticipation are generally defined by using hazard modelling. The relevance of this approach may be subject to discussion (Zevenbergen et al., 2011) particularly in view of the large number of uncertainties that make hazard evaluation so difficult. For this reason, uncertainty analysis is initially called upon in a theoretical approach before any applied approach. Generally, the uncertainty under study is not assessed in hydrological studies. This uncertainty is related to the choice of evaluation model used for extreme values. This application has been used on the territory of the town of Besançon in eastern France. Strategic orientations for regional resilience are presented taking into account the high levels of uncertainty concerning estimates for possible flow rates...|$|R

Therefore, some New Testament authors (for example, the writer of the Gospel of John) deliberately avoided speaking about the virgin birth and instead presented the birth of Jesus in terms of the idea of an incarnated, personified, divine Wisdom.

We compared the richness patterns of ferns in 333 plots along six tropical elevational gradients in America, the Mascarenes, and southeast Asia, using sterile populations {{as an indication of}} sink populations. First, we tested whether sterile fern records were more common towards the elevational range limits of the individual species, but found this pattern in only one out of ten cases. It is therefore uncertain if sterile records correspond to marginal sink populations. Second, we compared the elevational richness patterns of sterile and fertile species. In several cases, elevational trends for sterile and fertile records were quite similar, but in others they differed distinctly. The percentage of sterile records per plot decreased with elevation among epiphytic ferns along all six transects, whereas terrestrials showed mixed results (decrease, increase, and U-shaped patterns). The percentage of sterile species records per plot relative to the number of species per plot recovered four significant patterns among the twelve cases analysed: higher percentages at higher species numbers among terrestrial ferns on two transects and lower percentages among epiphytes on two others. Despite the problems with equating sterile records to sink populations, we thus found distinct elevational patterns of sterile records that clearly affected our perception of the overall richness patterns.

The results of this investigation show that women of childbearing age and children constitute high-risk groups. A previous advisory report of the SHC provides an in-depth discussion of the hazards attendant on consuming energy drinks. Indeed, it is the caffeine that remains the major cause of concern. There is currently no acknowledged reference value as regards the exposure to caffeine. The SHC takes the view that, for the adult population, the threshold above which there is an observable increase in anxiety is 3 mg/kg/day. For children, the upper intake level is 2. 5 mg/kg/day, with greater intakes <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>result</b> in altered behaviour. For women of childbearing age, it is advised that the daily intake should not exceed 300 mg/day. The intake of caffeine not only results from the consumption of coffee, tea, cocoa, soft drinks, but also that of energy drinks, their shot forms and alcoholic beverages, which has been rising significantly these past few years. It should be pointed out from the start that the data on the intake of caffeine in Belgium are scarce. The most recent are those provided by the 2004 food consumption survey. They have been used in this advisory report to assess the intake of caffeine. The average daily intake of caffeine for adults (aged 19 - 50) in Belgium amounts to 2. 3 mg/kg. For around one quarter of the adult Belgian population, the daily intake exceeds the 3 mg/kg threshold. An additional intake of 60 to 80 mg caffeine/day causes the proportion of individuals whose daily intake is above the 3 mg/kg/day threshold to double. Such an intake can be reached by consuming a single energy drink unit. This advisory report compares these results with those from other countries...|$|R
