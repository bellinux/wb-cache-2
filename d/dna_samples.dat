5|$|In 1992 {{an attempt}} was made to extract a {{mitochondrial}} DNA sequence from the skeletal remains of C.d.guildayi to compare its relationship to other Canis species. The attempt was unsuccessful because these remains had been removed from the LaBrea pits and tar could not be removed from the bone material. In 2014 an attempt to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth from the tar pits also failed, with the study concluding that organic compounds from the asphalt permeate the bones of all ancient samples from the LaBrea pits, hindering the extraction of <b>DNA</b> <b>samples.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{two studies}} of <b>DNA</b> <b>samples</b> {{from each of}} the whale populations {{concluded}} the northern and southern populations of right whale should be considered separate species. What some scientists found more surprising was the discovery that the North Pacific and North Atlantic populations are also distinct, and that the North Pacific species is more closely related to the southern right whale than to the North Atlantic right whale. The authors of one of these studies concluded that these species have not interbred for between 3million and 12million years.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the ALBC began {{investigating}} the Marsh Tacky {{to see if}} it was truly a descendent of Spanish stock, and during the organization's initial field investigations it was found that many surviving members of the breed fit the physical type of Colonial Spanish stock. In 2007, the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy collaborated with the Equus Survival Trust to collect <b>DNA</b> <b>samples</b> and photo-document the largest herd in South Carolina, considered to be the largest remaining herd, with a heritage tracing back to the American Civil War. DNA testing was undertaken in an effort to identify horses for a new studbook, reveal what DNA markers the breed carries, and map the breed's genetic place among all other horse breeds worldwide. Sixty horses were tested in the effort.|$|E

40|$|Standard {{consent forms}} for blood and tissue {{sampling}} are inadequate for <b>DNA</b> <b>sampling.</b> However, creating new and separate forms {{for each type}} of activity associated with DNA analysis (banking, linkage analysis and genetic diagnosis) tends to dissociate the participant from what is essentially a medical continuum. Furthermore, <b>DNA</b> <b>sampling</b> involves the sharing of samples and data among centres. To ensure patient control throughout this multifaceted process, we have developed an integrated approach to obtaining consent for <b>DNA</b> <b>sampling</b> at each level of participation. Movement from one level to another is reflected in the choices offered to participants. This inclusive approach is based on the underlying principle of informed consent, namely the respect for individuality, confidentiality and freedom of choice. This approach should help practitioners of medical genetics recognize the medical context of <b>DNA</b> <b>sampling...</b>|$|R

5|$|In December 2010, {{descendants}} of Edwin Booth {{reported that they}} obtained permission to exhume the Shakespearean actor's body to obtain <b>DNA</b> <b>samples</b> to compare {{with a sample of}} his brother John's DNA to refute the rumor that John had escaped after the assassination. Bree Harvey, a spokesman from the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts where Edwin Booth is buried, denied reports that the family had contacted them and requested to exhume Edwin's body. The family hoped to obtain samples of John Wilkes's DNA from remains such as vertebrae stored at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Maryland. On March 30, 2013, museum spokeswoman Carol Johnson announced that the family's request to extract DNA from the vertebrae had been rejected.|$|E
5|$|No genetic {{studies to}} date have {{correlated}} these prehistoric remains to any modern breed. What has been studied are Y-chromosomes (Y-DNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) obtained from Exmoor ponies. The Y-chromosome is passed on through the male line, and worldwide shows very little genetic variation in horses, except for a second Y-chromosome haplotype found in China, suggesting that a very limited number of stallions contributed to the original genome of the domestic horse. The Exmoor pony shares this general Y-chromosome haplotype. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA is passed on though the female line, and shows far more variation than Y-DNA, indicating {{that a large number}} of wild mares from several regions have contributed to modern domestic breeds. Some mtDNA-haplotypes have been found in <b>DNA</b> <b>samples</b> obtained from wild horses in prehistoric deposits, while other mtDNA-haplotypes have only been found in domesticated horses, from both living individuals and archeological finds. The Exmoor pony has a high frequency of pre-domestication mtDNA-haplotypes, but these are also found in different breeds all around the world. Currently, for the British Isles, there are only three DNA archeological samples available, all from Ireland. Although wild horses were abundant after the last ice age, the lack of sufficient pre-domestication <b>DNA</b> <b>samples</b> makes it impossible to determine the contribution of the wild horses of the British Islands to modern breeds, including the Exmoor pony. A 1995 study of morphological characteristics, the outward appearance of organisms, indicated that the Exmoor, Pottock, and Tarpan have an extremely close resemblance; these breeds were consistently grouped together in the results from several analyses, with the Exmoor showing the closest relationship to the Tarpan of all the breeds studied, at 0.27; the next-closest breeds to the Tarpan were the Pottock and Merens, both with a genetic distance from the Tarpan of 0.47. The distance between the Exmoor and Pottock was 0.37, and between the Exmoor and Merens was 0.40; a significantly wider gap than the distance between the Exmoor and Tarpan.|$|E
5|$|In Part II, {{after his}} mentor's defeat by Sasuke, Kabuto {{integrates}} some of Orochimaru's remains {{into his body}} to become powerful enough to not serve anyone again. Kabuto then masters snake Sage Justu while modifying his body with <b>DNA</b> <b>samples</b> of the Sound Five, Jugo, Suigetsu, and Karin to increase his abilities further. After perfecting the Reanimation Jutsu, using it to bring back Madara Uchiha as his personal trump card, Kabuto forces Obito Uchiha into a tenuous alliance with him under the promise that he can have Sasuke once they win {{the war against the}} Ninja Alliance. However, during {{the second day of the}} Fourth Great Ninja War, Itachi manages to break free of Kabuto's control and force him to end the Reanimation Jutsu with Sasuke's help. The ordeal of being subjected to Itachi's Izanami genjutsu has Kabuto re-evaluate himself of how to live his life, coming to the conclusion to save Sasuke's life. In the aftermath of the War, Kabuto returned to run the orphanage where he was held when he was a kid together with his adopted brother Urushi. In the Japanese anime, Kabuto is voiced by Nobutoshi Canna, and his English voice actor is Henry Dittman.|$|E

5|$|In {{a letter}} to Biologist in June 2001, British teacher and Chartered Biologist Paul Spiring speculated that Merrick might have {{suffered}} {{from a combination of}} the two syndromes. This hypothesis was reported by Robert Matthews, a correspondent for The Sunday Telegraph. The possibility that Merrick had both conditions formed the basis for a 2003 documentary film entitled The Curse of The Elephant Man that was produced for the Discovery Health Channel by Natural History New Zealand. During 2002, genealogical research for the film led to a BBC appeal to trace Merrick's maternal family line. In response to the appeal, a Leicester resident named Pat Selby was discovered to be the granddaughter of Merrick's uncle George Potterton. A research team took <b>DNA</b> <b>samples</b> from Selby in an unsuccessful attempt to diagnose Merrick's condition. During 2003, the filmmakers commissioned further diagnostic tests using DNA that was extracted from Merrick's hair and bone. However, the results of these tests proved inconclusive; therefore, the precise cause of Merrick's medical condition remains uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Janine tells Marsden that Ronnie has fled, but Marsden {{finds her}} at the Queen Vic. Marsden remarks that a new {{forensic}} profile has been found, and DNA screening of white males will shortly begin. After Hughes accepts a bribe from Jack to make the <b>DNA</b> <b>samples</b> disappear, Marsden receives an anonymous tip-off. The police search Janine's flat, finding the engagement ring that went missing the night of Archie's murder, and Janine is arrested but later released for lack of evidence. Becca Swanson (Simone James) calls the police, saying that Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) attacked Archie on Christmas Day, and the police arrive to arrest him. Marsden spots him when his phone rings; two officers chase him to the roof, where he stumbles and falls to his death. The investigation ends, since the police believe that Bradley had killed Archie; however, his killer was actually Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner).|$|E
5|$|Palpatine's {{ultimate}} fate {{is further}} chronicled in the Dark Empire II and Empire's End series of comics. The Dark Empire II series, published from 1994 to 1995, details how the Emperor {{is once again}} reborn on Byss into a clone body. Palpatine tries to rebuild the Empire as the Rebel Alliance grows weak. In Empire's End (1995), a traitorous Imperial guard bribes Palpatine's cloning supervisor to tamper with the Emperor's stored <b>DNA</b> <b>samples.</b> This causes the clones to deteriorate at a rapid rate. Palpatine tries to possess the body of Anakin Solo, the infant son of Leia Organa and Han Solo, before the clone body dies, but is thwarted once again by Luke Skywalker. Palpatine is killed by a blaster shot fired by Han, but his spirit is captured by the mortally-wounded Jedi Empatojayos Brand. When Brand dies, he takes Palpatine's spirit with him, destroying the Sith Lord once and for all.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} {{legislative}} session in 2003, Anderson championed House Bill 49, {{of which he}} was co-sponsor, to expand the state DNA database by requiring <b>DNA</b> <b>samples</b> from all convicted felons; any person convicted of a felony or misdemeanor crime against a person, such as assault; and anyone convicted of a misdemeanor sex offense. The bill applied the DNA sample requirement retroactively to people currently imprisoned or on parole for those crimes, as well as anyone required to register as a sex offender. Some serious juvenile offenders were also included under HB 49. The bill enjoyed wide bipartisan support, and was signed into law by Gov. Frank Murkowski on June 13, 2003. However, in October 2003 a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order which disallowed the state from requiring <b>DNA</b> <b>samples</b> from convicted sex offenders who had completed their sentences unless the state had first obtained a warrant and shown probable cause to believe a crime had been committed. Ultimately, the portion of the law requiring registered sex offenders who had completed their sentences to provide <b>DNA</b> <b>samples</b> was struck down as unconstitutional by U.S. District Judge John Sedwick; other provisions of the law remained intact.|$|E
