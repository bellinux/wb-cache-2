30|$|Herein, {{we report}} a novel method that {{directly}} fabricates copper electrodes from copper salt, rather than pre-synthesized nanoparticle ink. Without using copper oxide as the copper source, the residual non-conducting oxide, which exists at the inner parts of reduced copper pattern, {{can be avoided}} [20, 25]. Laser reduction is also convenient to pattern the electrodes with tailored {{physical and chemical properties}} [26, 27, 28]. Moreover, compared with two-dimensional plane processing with an intense pulsed light method, the advantages of laser <b>direct</b> <b>writing</b> also stem from the fact that laser <b>direct</b> <b>writing</b> is a cost-effective and facile three-dimensional (3 D) precise fabrication method, which offers <b>direct</b> <b>writing</b> <b>capability.</b> Consequently, this leads to a significant reduction in the number processing steps, and the material wastage associated with the traditional techniques, such as vacuum deposition and photolithography.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a laser-assisted dry transfer technique for assembling patterns of vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays on a flexible polymeric substrate. A laser beam {{is applied to}} the interface of a nanotube array and a polycarbonate sheet in contact with one another. The absorbed laser heat promotes nanotube adhesion to the polymer in the irradiated regions and enables selective pattern transfer. A combination of the thermal transfer mechanism with rapid <b>direct</b> <b>writing</b> <b>capability</b> of focused laser beam irradiation allows us to achieve simultaneous material transfer and direct micropatterning in a single processing step. Furthermore, we demonstrate that malleability of the nanotube arrays transferred onto a flexible substrate enables post-transfer tailoring of electric conductance by collapsing the aligned nanotubes in different directions. This work suggests that the laser-assisted transfer technique provides an efficient route to using vertically aligned nanotubes as conductive elements in flexible device applications. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|R
50|$|In 2004, {{interest}} in the system for use within the DoD was renewed, and further development was done to add a true bi-directional connection component to the FHIE system. Initially called the Data Sharing Initiative (DSI), adapters {{were added to the}} FHIE system using the Web Services XML-based protocol standard. A similar Web Services adapter was developed for the DoD to connect to their CHCS-I legacy patient record systems. In this way, both systems hosted a peer Web Services client that is accessible to the other with proper authentication, allowing bi-directional, query-based data exchanges between the disparate systems. <b>Direct</b> cross-Domain <b>write</b> <b>capability</b> and fully computable data storage and transfers are not supported at this time.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 The {{focus of}} this study is to develop a general and {{low-cost}} solution-based process to fabricate micro- and nano-structured semiconductors that are suitable for electronics. This process uses simple metal halide precursors dissolved in a solvent (organic or aqueous) and is capable of forming uniform and continuous thin films via digital fabrication (e. g. inkjet printing) and blanket coating (e. g. spin coating and chemical bath deposition). It has been demonstrated for the deposition of a variety of semiconducting metal oxides including binary oxides (ZnO, In 2 O 3, SnO 2), ternary oxides (Zinc-Indium-Oxide (ZIO), Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO), Zinc- Tin-Oxide (ZTO)) and quaternary oxides, Indium-Zinc-Tin-Oxide (IZTO). Functional thin film transistors with high field-effect mobility were successfully fabricated using channel layers deposited from this process (μFE ≅ 30 cm 2 /V-sec from inkjet printed IZTO channel layers). This rather simple solution-based deposition process was used to fabricate 3 -D nano-structured silicate-based luminescent materials from diatom frustules. A diatom is a single-celled microalgae that possesses cell walls composed of amorphous silica (SiO 2) with nano- and microstructures. Nanocrystalline Zn 2 SiO 4 thin films with Mn dopants on the frustules isolated from the cultured marine diatoms Pinnularia sp. by a combination of chemical solution deposition of ZnO thin film and solid-solid reaction between ZnO and SiO 2 (diatom) by thermal annealing processes. This material exhibited bright green photoluminescence. Two types of nanostructures could be generated depending upon the level of the initial chemical deposition coverage. This process is capable of preserving the threedimensional shape of the diatom frustules at the nanometer scale. Using this process and the <b>direct</b> <b>writing</b> <b>capability</b> of the inkjet printing process, patterned Zn 2 SiO 4 :Mn 2 + green phosphors and Yi 2 SiO 5 :Eu 3 + were fabricated. At first, a layer of diatom frustules was spun-coated onto a silicon substrate and followed by the inkjet printing of aqueous metal halide solutions with desired patterns. The metal silicate phosphors were generated after a thermal annealing process. SEM analysis verified that the nano- and microstructures of the diatom frustules were preserved after the process. The patterned phosphors exhibited highly bright green (Mn 2 + dopant) and orange (Eu 3 + dopant) photoluminescence under 254 nm UV excitation...|$|R

40|$|A new {{and highly}} {{versatile}} domain patterning method-ultraviolet <b>direct</b> <b>write</b> metal enhanced redox (UV <b>direct</b> <b>write</b> MER) -achieves deep domains with practically no thermally-induced {{damage on the}} surface of lithium niobate crystals. In UV <b>direct</b> <b>write</b> MER, after coating with a thin layer of chromium, the domain inversion is generated by a redox process induced in the crystal by illumination with high intensity UV in an ambient dry nitrogen atmosphere. This new technique enables the fabrication of practical piezoelectric acoustic superlattice structures on 128 ° YX-cut LiNbO 3, the most widely used crystal cut for surface acoustic wave applications. For example, UV <b>direct</b> <b>write</b> MER was used to form an acoustic superlattice 128 ° YX structure that in turn enabled the generation of surface acoustic waves of sufficient strength to develop fluid flow within a droplet of water, demonstrating its potential in practical microfluidic manipulation.

Five seventh grade Language Arts classes participated in the study; two classes were taught using Student-Centered Writing Instruction and three classed were taught using Teacher-Directed Writing Instruction.

The results indicate that more students who received Student-Centered Writing Instruction scored better on the post-test than those who received Teacher-Directed Writing Instruction.
