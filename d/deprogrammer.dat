5|$|The bulk of Moxon's {{legal work}} is Scientology-related. He {{has served as}} Commissioner of the Scientology-affiliated {{organization}} Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR). He represented the Church of Scientology in 1988 in a billion-dollar class action lawsuit against the organization by former Scientologists which was dismissed in Los Angeles Superior Court. In 1990 Moxon represented the organization in a suit against the Internal Revenue Service {{in an attempt to}} gain access to information about Scientology held by the IRS. He assisted 50 Scientologists in filing separate lawsuits against the organization Cult Awareness Network (CAN), which led to the bankruptcy of the organization. He represented the plaintiff in the Jason Scott case against CAN and cult <b>deprogrammer</b> Rick Ross.|$|E
25|$|The Cult Awareness Network (CAN) was an {{organization}} created by <b>deprogrammer</b> Ted Patrick that provided information on groups that it {{considered to be}} cults, as well as support and referrals to deprogrammers.|$|E
25|$|The Jason Scott {{case was}} a United States civil suit, brought against <b>deprogrammer</b> Rick Ross, two of his associates, and the Cult Awareness Network (CAN), for the {{abduction}} and failed deprogramming of Jason Scott, {{a member of a}} Pentecostalist church. Scott was eighteen {{years old at the time}} of the abduction and thus legally an adult. CAN was a co-defendant because a CAN contact person had referred Scott's mother to Rick Ross. In the trial, Jason Scott was represented by Kendrick Moxon, a prominent Scientologist attorney.|$|E
50|$|Groups {{such as the}} Cult Awareness Network {{operated}} a referral scheme (NARDEC) {{in which they would}} refer people to <b>deprogrammers</b> in return for a 'kickback' {{in the form of a}} donation or as a commission. <b>Deprogrammers</b> such as Rick Ross, Steven Hassan and Carol Giambalvo were amongst the CAN referred <b>deprogrammers.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{has never}} been a {{standard}} procedure among deprogrammers; descriptions in anecdotal reports, studies, and interviews with former <b>deprogrammers</b> vary greatly. <b>Deprogrammers</b> generally operate on the presumption that the people they are paid to extract from religious organizations are victims of mind control (or brainwashing). Books written by <b>deprogrammers</b> and exit counselors say that the most essential part of freeing the mind of a person is to convince the subject that he or she had been under the mental control of others.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, Stephanie Riethmiller, {{who lived}} in Ohio, was kidnapped by <b>deprogrammers</b> hired by her parents to end her lesbian relationship. She was held against her will and {{repeatedly}} raped. After her release she filed civil charges against her parents and the <b>deprogrammers,</b> which were dismissed in a trial that generated some controversy in the media.|$|R
500|$|Jason Scott of the Life Tabernacle Church in Bellevue, Washington {{was taken}} {{from his home in}} 1991 and {{subjected}} to [...] "deprogramming". <b>Deprogrammer</b> Rick Ross had been referred to Scott's mother by a local volunteer for CAN, and Moxon represented Scott in a lawsuit against Ross and CAN. Moxon took on Jason Scott's case pro bono. According to a 60 Minutes report on Scientology's actions against the Cult Awareness Network, two affidavits used by Moxon in the case were false. Scott won a jury judgment of US$5 million including $1.8 million against CAN, and CAN later declared bankruptcy. After the CAN organization was purchased in bankruptcy court by a Scientology attorney, Scott fired Moxon and hired Graham Berry, a Los Angeles lawyer who had previously represented clients in suits against the Church of Scientology. Scott and Ross settled in 1996 for $5,000 and 200 hours of time from Ross for his intervention services.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, {{the team}} {{had come up with}} a core {{gameplay}} mechanic idea based on three groups of forces; drones that would carry a desirable resource, protectors that would guard the drones, and harvesters that would attempt to take the resource from the drones; these would eventually bear out as the Little Sisters, Big Daddies, and splicers in the final game, but {{at the time of the}} concept, there was no set theme. They began working on creating a setting for the game as to be able to pitch the idea to game publishers. A 2002 demonstration version was based on the Unreal Engine 2 for the first Xbox. This demonstration was primarily set aboard a space station overtaken with genetically-mutated monsters; the main character was Carlos Cuello, a [...] "cult deprogrammer"â€”a person charged with rescuing someone from a cult, and mentally and psychologically readjusting that person to a normal life. Ken Levine cites an example of what a cult <b>deprogrammer</b> does: [...] " [...] people who hired people to [...] deprogram their daughter who had been in a lesbian relationship. They kidnap her and reprogram her, and it was a really dark person, and that was the [...] character that you were." [...] This story would have been more political in nature, with the character hired by a Senator. The team collectively agreed that this game was not what they had set out to make, and were having trouble finding a publisher. They considered ending development, but as news about their efforts to make a spiritual successor to System Shock 2 began to appear in gaming magazines and websites, the team opted to continue development, performing a full revamp the game.|$|E

2500|$|Since then, {{academics}} {{who published}} a joint paper with Kendrick Moxon and later others referencing their work {{have stated that}} the [...] "Old CAN" [...] covertly continued to make and derive income from referrals to coercive <b>deprogrammers</b> and to activist members for distribution, while publicly distancing itself from the practice.

2500|$|CAN {{declared}} bankruptcy after a jury found that CAN conspired {{to violate the}} civil rights and religious liberties of Jason Scott, a Pentecostalist, who had been forcibly kidnapped and subjected to a failed deprogramming by Rick Ross, a CAN-referred <b>deprogrammer</b> and others. The court ordered CAN to pay a judgment of US$1 million. [...] The large award was intended to deter similar conduct in the future; the court noted that the defendants were unable to appreciate the maliciousness of their conduct towards the deprogrammee, and portrayed themselves, throughout the entire process of litigation, as victims of the alleged agenda of the plaintiff's attorney, Church of Scientology attorney Kendrick Moxon.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, CAN, and two co-defendants {{were found}} guilty of {{negligence}} and conspiracy to violate the civil rights and religious liberties of Jason Scott, then {{a member of the}} Life Tabernacle Church, a small United Pentecostalist congregation in Bellevue, Washington. [...] Rick Alan Ross was acquitted in the criminal trial. [...] A CAN volunteer had referred Ross to Scott's mother, endorsing his ability as a <b>deprogrammer.</b> The mother thereupon retained Ross's services. [...] In a civil trial, Ross was ordered to pay more than US$3 million in damages; CAN, having referred Ross to Scott's mother, was ordered to pay a judgement of US$1 million. The court found that CAN volunteers had routinely referred callers to deprogrammers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, the Cult Awareness Network (CAN) held a {{press conference}} and {{demonstration}} in Washington, D.C., saying that the organization that teaches the Transcendental Meditation technique [...] "seeks to strip individuals of their ability to think and choose freely."

Another spokesperson, Mark Haviland of the related College of Natural Law said that TM is [...] "not a philosophy, a life style or a religion.|$|E

Shupe, Moxon and Darnell repeated these allegations in a 2004 Baylor University Press publication entitled New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America, edited by Derek Davis and Barry Hankins. They expressed {{the view that the}} [...] "Old CAN" [...] could reasonably be described as a criminal organization operating in large part for the profit to certain actors, and that it cultivated a hypocritical and deceptive public persona. They alleged that despite public denials, the [...] "Old CAN" [...] operating policy included routine referrals to coercive <b>deprogrammers,</b> citing, among others, FBI wiretap evidence documenting frequent, casual contact between coercive <b>deprogrammers</b> and Cynthia Kisser, {{the executive director of the}} [...] "Old CAN". They further alleged that the [...] "Old CAN" [...] operated as a money laundering scheme, with coercive <b>deprogrammers</b> expected to [...] "kick back" [...] to the [...] "Old CAN" [...] part of the fees they charged families, in the form of direct or indirect donations. Other allegations made by Shupe, Darnell and Moxon included irregularities in finances suggestive of personal enrichment by some [...] "Old CAN" [...] officials, as well as the use of legal and illegal drugs by <b>deprogrammers</b> during deprogrammings, and occurrences of sexual intercourse between <b>deprogrammers</b> and deprogrammees.
