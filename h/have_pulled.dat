5|$|The Shire has an {{enormous}} capacity for pulling weight. In 1924, at a British exhibition, a pair of horses was estimated to <b>have</b> <b>pulled</b> a starting load equal to 45 tons, although an exact number could not be determined as their pull exceeded the maximum reading on the dynamometer. Working in slippery footing, the same pair of horses pulled 16.5 tons at a later exhibition.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, Balotelli {{became the}} {{youngest}} Inter player (at 18 years and 85 days) to score in the Champions League when he scored a goal in a 3–3 draw against Cypriot side Anorthosis Famagusta, beating the previous record set by Obafemi Martins (at 18 years and 145 days). In an April 2009 match with Juventus where he scored Inter's only goal in a 1–1 draw, Balotelli was racially abused by Juventus fans throughout the game. This led Inter owner Massimo Moratti {{to say that he}} would <b>have</b> <b>pulled</b> the team off the pitch had he been present. The racist chants were also condemned by Juventus chairman Giovanni Cobolli Gigli and Juventus were given a one-game home-fan ban because of the incident. Inter won Serie A for the fourth time in a row.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 2015, police {{released}} a video {{from the night}} before the theft, that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape; one of them remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified man into the museum twice within a few minutes. The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off. Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and The New York Times points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator. However, the guards have previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to <b>have</b> <b>pulled</b> off the heist.|$|E

5|$|On {{the same}} day, the Egyptian forces also changed the {{disposition}} of their forces, moving the 9th Battalion to the Ad Halom bridge, the 2nd to Isdud itself, and the 1st to Iraq Suwaydan and Faluja. Heavy machine gun and armored units were dispersed in between. Staff soldiers and those who manned Bren carriers took positions together with regular infantry soldiers. The Israeli side {{did not know of}} this development, but was aware that they had been detected in the previous night's preparations. The army was against attacking Isdud soon, but the order was given by the political echelon. The attack was expected to be a tactical failure; Avraham Ayalon writes that it could have succeeded if only the southern Egyptian force in Isdud itself was attacked, but attributes that lack of such a plan to the inexperience of the command and the heterogeneous nature of the Israeli force, which according to him could not <b>have</b> <b>pulled</b> off such an offensive.|$|E

25|$|Simeon {{wanted to}} run away from society, so he acted.

25|$|Williamson's tenure with Boston was {{a troubled}} one: his ERA {{with the team}} was 6.20 and he pitched just 20 innings in 24 appearances. In mid-September he {{underwent}} an MRI but the result was negative. As Boston entered the playoffs he shared closer duties with Mike Timlin. In the American League Championship series against New York, Williamson earned saves in Games 1, 4 and 6. Nevertheless, Little left a tiring Pedro Martínez in the 8th inning of Game 7 with Boston up 5-2. Martinez gave up three runs and New York would eventually win in the 11th inning 6-5. Critics maintain that Little should <b>have</b> <b>pulled</b> Martinez in favor of Williamson or Timlin, but that their mixed record {{during the regular season}} led Little to stay with the veteran Martinez.|$|E
25|$|Divisions {{began to}} appear between the {{investor}}s and the producers. Although {{it was not clear}} who was to blame – a main investor was rumoured to <b>have</b> <b>pulled</b> out, or hadn't the proposed capital – events came to a head in October 2003 and a press release issued on the 20th of October declared that the show was cancelled. It was a major blow to everyone involved : thousands of ticket-buyers had to be refunded, the CD had already been launched and a huge media campaign had to be cancelled (which would have incorporated amongst others France 2, RTL and Télérama). Owing to the risk taken – and arguably demonstrating foresight on behalf of the management – the actors' contracts stipulated they would not be paid until the show had been performed.|$|E

However, in the May 2008 tournament he could only manage three wins from the maegashira 1 ranking. Demoted to maegashira 10 for July, he struggled again, winning only five bouts. He was disqualified from his final match against Kimurayama after his was judged to <b>have</b> <b>pulled</b> his opponent's topknot, which is a kinjite, or foul. Kokkai maintained it was accidental as the tape on his fingers had stuck to Kimurayama's hair.
