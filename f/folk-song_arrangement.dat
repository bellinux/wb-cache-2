5000|$|The {{original}} {{theme music}} was, like Z-Cars, a <b>folk-song</b> <b>arrangement</b> by Fritz Spiegl. It was released {{as a single}} (credited to the London Waits) on Andrew Loog Oldham's [...] "Immediate" [...] record label in 1966.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{is usually}} sung to the Welsh harp tune [...] "Llydaw" [...] (the Welsh name for [...] "Brittany"). Many {{settings}} of the tune {{have been made}} by British composers, most notably Benjamin Britten in volume three of his <b>Folk-song</b> <b>arrangements</b> (1947). Roger Quilter's setting of the song was included in the Arnold Book of Old Songs, published in 1950.|$|R
5000|$|The {{folk song}} {{is used in}} a number of well known <b>folk-song</b> <b>arrangements,</b> for example by the English {{composer}}s Benjamin Britten and Gordon Jacob along with the Australian composer Percy Aldridge Grainger. Its melody forms the opening bars of the [...] "Radio 4 UK Theme" [...] by Fritz Spiegl, which was played every morning at the switch-on of BBC Radio 4 from late 1978 until April 2006.|$|R
50|$|Bella {{began to}} compose whilst {{studying}} in Levoča. At this time his output was largely small-scale, such as church music, <b>folk-song</b> <b>arrangements</b> and some chamber music. In 1873 however, visiting Vienna and Prague, he heard {{for the first}} time the music of, amongst others, Robert Schumann, Richard Wagner and Bedřich Smetana. This encounter with romantic music had a profound effect, of which the first result was Bella's 1874 symphonic poem Osud a ideál (Fate and the Ideal), which premiered in Prague in 1876.|$|R
500|$|Vaughan Williams {{is among}} the best-known British symphonists, noted for his very wide range of moods, from stormy and impassioned to tranquil, from mysterious to exuberant. Among the most {{familiar}} of his other concert works are Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis (1910) and The Lark Ascending (1914). His vocal works include hymns, <b>folk-song</b> <b>arrangements</b> and large-scale choral pieces. He wrote eight works for stage performance between 1919 and 1951. Although none of his operas became popular repertoire pieces, his ballet [...] (1930) was successful and has been frequently staged.|$|R
40|$|First {{recording}} of Quilter's Complete Folksong Arrangements, and premiere recordings of vocal duets. Rooted {{in the sound}} of the Victorian drawing-room ballad, Roger Quilter’s songs are elegant, refined, often private, always exquisite and without undue embellishment. Although Quilter did not draw on English folk-song as a musical resource in the way that Vaughan Williams and others did, he was very well aware of the heritage and himself arranged a variety of songs, ‘one of the most delicate and dangerous undertakings’. This recording, which includes several world premières, presents the Complete <b>Folk-Song</b> <b>Arrangements</b> and Complete Part-Songs for Women’s Voices<br/...|$|R
50|$|Pulver {{composed}} incidental {{music for}} works including Shakespeare's King Lear; Sholom Aleichem's 200.000 and The Man of the Air; Adventures of Benjamin the Third after Mendele Mocher Sforim; Abraham Goldfaden's The Sorceress (in collaboration with Joseph Achron); and Zalman Shneyer's Freylekhs (in collaboration with Maximilian Shteynberg). He also composed operettas (Gulliver, Inside the Big Top, What is her name?), movie scores, songs, and Yiddish <b>folk-song</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Some of his tunes {{have been considered}} as Jewish folklore. He {{was one of the}} important musicians bridging the traditional Eastern European Jewish music with the Western classical music forms.|$|R
2500|$|In 1881, Balakirev {{was offered}} the {{directorship}} of the Moscow Conservatory, along with the conductorship of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society. Perhaps keeping in mind his experience with the Saint Petersburg branch of the Russian Musical Society years earlier, he declined the position. Instead, he resumed the directorship of the Free School of Music. In 1882 he finished Tamara and revised his [...] "symphonic picture" [...] 1,000 Years two years later, retitling it Rus. In 1883, he was appointed director of the Imperial Chapel; Rimsky-Korsakov eventually became his assistant. He held this post until 1895, when he took his final retirement and composed in earnest. Between 1895 and 1910 he completed two symphonies, a piano sonata and two movements of his Second Piano Concerto, along with republishing his collection of <b>folk-song</b> <b>arrangements.</b>|$|R
50|$|With {{appropriate}} insight, he set Scots {{lyrics and}} arranged <b>folk-songs.</b> Many <b>arrangements</b> {{are included in}} the Dunedin Collection of Scots Songs (1908), which he edited. In 1907 he collaborated with the Duke of Argyll in The Scottish Tribute to France, for chorus and orchestra; it remained unperformed at his death.|$|R
500|$|Delius, {{but well}} ahead of Grieg and Tchaikovsky. Nevertheless, {{in his later years}} he [...] {{frequently}} denigrated [...] his career, for example writing to Scott: [...] "I have never been a true musician or true artist". [...] His failure to be recognised as a composer for anything beyond his [...] popular <b>folk-song</b> <b>arrangements</b> was a source of frustration and disappointment; for years after his death [...] the bulk of his output remained largely unperformed. From the 1990s {{an increase in the number}} of Grainger [...] recordings has brought a revival of interest in his works, and has enhanced his reputation as a composer. An unsigned tribute published on the Gramophone website in February 2011 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Grainger's death opined that [...] "though he would never be put on a pedestal to join the pantheon of immortals, he is unorthodox, original and deserves better than to be dismissed by the more snooty arbiters of musical taste".|$|R
5000|$|In 1945 Grainger devised an {{informal}} ratings system for composers and musical styles, based on criteria that included originality, complexity and beauty. Of forty composers and styles, he ranked himself equal ninth - behind Wagner andDelius, but {{well ahead of}} Grieg and Tchaikovsky. Nevertheless, {{in his later years}} he frequently denigrated his career, for example writing to Scott: [...] "I have never been a true musician or true artist".

500|$|Through his {{association}} with Frank Bridge, Britten's musical horizons expanded. He discovered the music of Debussy and Ravel which, Matthews writes, [...] "gave him a model for an orchestral sound". Bridge also led Britten {{to the music of}} Schoenberg and Berg; the latter's death in 1935 affected Britten deeply. A letter at that time reveals his thoughts on the contemporary music scene: [...] "The real musicians are so few & far between, aren't they? Apart from the Bergs, Stravinskys, Schoenbergs & Bridges one is a bit stumped for names, isn't one?" [...] – adding, as an afterthought: [...] "Shostakovitch – perhaps – possibly". By this time Britten had developed a lasting hostility towards the English pastoral school represented by Vaughan Williams and Ireland, whose work he compared unfavourably with the [...] "brilliant <b>folk-song</b> <b>arrangements</b> of Percy Grainger"; Grainger became the inspiration of many of Britten's later folk arrangements. Britten was also impressed by Delius, and thought Brigg Fair [...] "delicious" [...] when he heard it in 1931. Also in that year he heard Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which he found [...] "bewildering and terrifying", {{yet at the same time}} [...] "incredibly marvellous and arresting". The same composer's Symphony of Psalms, and Petrushka were lauded in similar terms. [...] However, he and Stravinsky later developed a mutual antipathy informed by jealousy and mistrust.|$|R
50|$|Ristić {{wrote his}} most boldest compositions, {{including}} those in quarter- and sixth-tone systems, during his studies. He is though, {{best known for his}} nine symphonies and other orchestral works, such as Sinfonietta, Man and war (symphonic poem), Symphonic movement, Suita giocosa, Symphonic variations, Burlesque, Seven bagatelles, The Suite, Three little pieces, Three polyphonic studies, and The Gallop. Along with his symphonic compositions, he wrote a number of concertante works, including Concerto for violin, two concertos for piano, Concerto for clarinet, Concerto for trumpet, Concerto for orchestra, and Concerto for chamber orchestra. His chamber oeuvre in the semitone system consists of notable works such as the five-string quartets, Wind quintet, Sonata for two violins and piano, two sonatas for violin and piano, Sonata for viola and piano, Duet for violin and piano, Duet for violin and viola, and twenty-four fugues for various instrumental ensembles. Among Ristić's quarter-tone works are: Suite for four trombones, the Septet, Suite for ten string instruments, Sonata for solo violin, and his Duet for violin and cello, which is based upon the sixth-tone microtonal system. Ristić also composed stage music for the ballets Cinderella and The Tyrant (unfinished). His works Through the blizzard, The Poplar, The Death of Smail-aga Čengić, and A Song about the hawk, for narrator and chamber or large orchestra, aligned him with a few Serbian composers who fostered the melodrama genre. Ristić left behind a certain number of <b>folk-song</b> and dance <b>arrangements</b> and orchestrations of compositions by Josif Marinković and Isidor Bajić.|$|R
