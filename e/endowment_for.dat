40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of a rural credit market in Peru. We develop a model that shows that collateral requirements imposed by lenders in response to asymmetric information can lead not just to quantity rationing but also to transaction cost rationing and risk rationing. Just like quantity rationing, these two additional forms of non-price rationing adversely affect farm resource allocation and productivity. We test the insights of the model using a panel data set from Northern Peru. We estimate the returns to productive <b>endowments</b> <b>for</b> constrained and unconstrained households using a switching regression model. We find that, consistent with the theory, productivity is independent of <b>endowments</b> <b>for</b> unconstrained households but is tightly linked to <b>endowments</b> <b>for</b> constrained households. We estimate that credit constraints lower the value of agricultural output in the study region by 26 %. Financial Economics, International Development,...|$|R

5|$|As {{a public}} university, McGill {{is not as}} {{dependent}} on its <b>endowment</b> <b>for</b> operating revenue as some of its international peers. The McGill endowment only provides approximately 10 per cent of the school's annual operating revenues. Nonetheless, McGill's endowment rests within the top 10 percent of all North American post-secondary institutions' endowments. While McGill's conservative investment policy has protected it from the more substantial losses experienced at many other universities during the market crisis of 2008–2009, it still faced a 20% endowment decline from approximately $920 million to $740 million. Currently valued at $39,323 per student, the university's endowment is the second largest among Canadian universities on a per-student basis.|$|E

5|$|Rocco Landesman, {{chairperson}} of the National <b>Endowment</b> <b>for</b> the Arts, has used Citygarden {{as an example of}} a successful foundation-funded art venture.

Michael Van Valkenburgh, principal of a Brooklyn landscape architecture firm, said he was drawn to St. Louis partly because of Citygarden's design and success. Van Valkenburgh was selected in 2010 to renovate the grounds of the Gateway Arch.|$|E
