40|$|<b>Gomuti</b> <b>fibre</b> is {{obtained}} from Arenga pinnata tree {{and is known}} with other names such as sugar-palm fibre, gomutu, ijuk, serat aren and black fibre. This article presents a review on the physical, mechanical, chemical and thermal properties of <b>gomuti</b> <b>fibre</b> in comparison with other common natural fibres. Furthermore, this article reviews the mechanical properties of <b>gomuti</b> <b>fibre</b> composites with thermoset polymer resins based on the existing published literature. It is observable that <b>gomuti</b> <b>fibre</b> has a close similarity to coir fibre in its physical and mechanical properties than the other natural fibres. It has the characteristics of lower density, strength and modulus, but higher elongation. The composites with <b>gomuti</b> <b>fibre</b> also exhibit properties similar to coir fibre composites. ...|$|E
40|$|Gomuti is {{a natural}} fibre {{obtained}} from Arenga pinnata tree. In its native countries, the fibre {{has been used as}} roof, rope, insulation and water filter. This paper presents a study into the physical, mechanical and thermal characteristics of <b>gomuti</b> <b>fibre</b> to observe its viability as natural fibre composite material. The study includes observations of fibre morphology, diameter, density, single fibre tensile testing and observation of fibre thermal stability. It was found that diameter of the studied <b>gomuti</b> <b>fibre</b> was in a range of 81 – 313 mm, with an average of 168 mm. Density of gomuti was � 1. 40 g/cm 3. The average strength of single <b>gomuti</b> <b>fibre</b> was 173. 9 MPa and the average modulus of elasticity was 3847 MPa. Alkali treatment with sodium hydroxide was conducted to evaluate modifications in the fibre's characteristics. The treated gomuti fibres show altered diameter range, density, single fibre tensile properties and different thermogravimetric plots. Based on the results, <b>gomuti</b> <b>fibre</b> can be considered viable to be developed into natural fibre composites. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Gomuti</b> <b>fibre</b> or sugar-palm fibre is {{a natural}} fibre that {{traditionally}} {{has been used as}} roofing and insulation material. This paper presents an experimental investigation into the properties and behaviour of <b>gomuti</b> <b>fibre</b> composites when subjected to axial tensile and compressive load. Composite panels prepared for this study are the combinations of untreated unidirectional <b>gomuti</b> <b>fibre</b> with three different polymer thermoset resins (epoxy, vinylester and polyester). The panels are fabricated manually by hand lay-up. Results show that the average tensile strength of the composite specimens is between 35 – 46 MPa and the average compressive strength between 82 – 108 MPa. Specimens of gomuti/vinylester have the highest average tensile and compressive strength. Load vs extension plots of tensile specimens of all three combinations display elastic region before sudden break after peak load while compressive specimens of each combination exhibit different tendency after the elastic region and peak load. ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, gomuti fibres/polyester {{composites}} {{are examined}} for tensile and flexural properties. The specimens {{are produced by}} hand lay-up method for practicality. Fibre forms are in four variations that are random original layout, chopped random, unidirectional and woven mat. The fibres are not chemically treated for the purpose to initially evaluate and determine the properties of untreated gomuti fibres/polyester composites. Results showed that specimens with unidirectional orientation have the highest average tensile strength. Meanwhile, woven mat specimens have the highest flexural strength. It is noted from the experimental results that <b>gomuti</b> <b>fibres</b> have a potential prospect as fibre reinforcement in composites...|$|R
