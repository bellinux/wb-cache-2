5|$|Following Asilomar, new genetic {{engineering}} techniques and applications developed rapidly. DNA sequencing methods improved greatly (pioneered by Frederick Sanger and Walter Gilbert), as did oligonucleotide synthesis and transfection techniques. Researchers learned {{to control the}} expression of transgenes, and were soon racing—in both academic and industrial contexts—to create organisms capable of expressing human genes {{for the production of}} human hormones. However, this was a more daunting task than molecular biologists had expected; developments between 1977 and 1980 showed that, due to the phenomena of split genes and splicing, higher organisms had a much more complex system of gene expression than the bacteria models of earlier studies. The first such race, for synthesizing <b>human</b> <b>insulin,</b> was won by Genentech. This {{marked the beginning of the}} biotech boom (and with it, the era of gene patents), with an unprecedented level of overlap between biology, industry, and law.|$|E
25|$|Biosynthetic <b>human</b> <b>insulin</b> (insulin human rDNA, INN) for {{clinical}} use is manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. Biosynthetic <b>human</b> <b>insulin</b> has increased purity when compared with extractive animal insulin, enhanced purity reducing antibody formation.

This technique is anticipated to reduce production costs.|$|E
25|$|The <b>human</b> <b>insulin</b> {{protein is}} {{composed}} of 51 amino acids, and has a molecular mass of 5808 Da. It is a dimer of an A-chain and a B-chain, which are linked together by disulfide bonds. Insulin's structure varies slightly between species of animals. Insulin from animal sources differs somewhat in effectiveness (in carbohydrate metabolism effects) from <b>human</b> <b>insulin</b> because of these variations.

50|$|Cats may {{be treated}} with animal insulin (bovine-based insulin is most similar to cat <b>insulin),</b> or with <b>human</b> {{synthetic}} <b>insulin.</b> The best choice of insulin brand and type varies from animal-to-animal and may require some trial-and-error. The <b>human</b> synthetic <b>insulin,</b> Humulin N /Novolin N/ NPH, is usually a poor choice for cats, since cats metabolize insulin about twice as fast. The Lente and Ultralente versions were popular for feline use until summer 2005, when they were discontinued.|$|R
5000|$|Two ultra-slow {{time-release}} synthetic <b>human</b> <b>insulins</b> {{became available}} in 2004 and 2005, generically known as insulin detemir (Levemir) and insulin glargine (Lantus). Studies have had good results with insulin glargine in cats. [...] Follow-up research [...] shows that Levemir {{can be used}} with a similar protocol and that either insulin, on this protocol, can lead uncomplicated feline cases to remission, with the most success being in cats who start on these protocols as soon as possible after diagnosis.|$|R
25|$|Several analogs of <b>human</b> <b>insulin</b> are available. These insulin analogs {{are closely}} related to the <b>human</b> <b>insulin</b> structure, and were {{developed}} for specific aspects of glycemic control in terms of fast action (prandial insulins) and long action (basal insulins). The first biosynthetic insulin analog was developed for clinical use at mealtime (prandial insulin), Humalog (insulin lispro), it is more rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection than regular insulin, with an effect 15minutes after injection. Other rapid-acting analogues are NovoRapid and Apidra, with similar profiles. All are rapidly absorbed due to amino acid sequences that will reduce formation of dimers and hexamers (monomeric insulins are more rapidly absorbed). Fast acting insulins do not require the injection-to-meal interval previously recommended for <b>human</b> <b>insulin</b> and animal insulins. The other type is long acting insulin; the first of these was Lantus (insulin glargine). These have a steady effect for an extended period from 18 to 24hours. Likewise, another protracted insulin analogue (Levemir) is based on a fatty acid acylation approach. A myristyric acid molecule is attached to this analogue, which associates the insulin molecule to the abundant serum albumin, which in turn extends the effect and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. Both protracted analogues need to be taken only once daily, and are used for type 1 diabetics as the basal insulin. A combination of a rapid acting and a protracted insulin is also available, making it more likely for patients to achieve an insulin profile that mimics that of the body´s own insulin release.|$|E
25|$|Sanofi-Aventis {{developed}} glargine as a longer-lasting insulin analogue, {{and markets}} {{it under the}} trade name Lantus. It was created by modifying three amino acids. Two positively charged arginine molecules {{were added to the}} C-terminus of the B-chain, and they shift the isoelectric point from 5.4 to 6.7, making glargine more soluble at a slightly acidic pH and less soluble at a physiological pH. Replacing the acid-sensitive asparagine at position 21 in the A-chain by glycine is needed to avoid deamination and dimerization of the arginine residue. These three structural changes and formulation with zinc result in a prolonged action when compared with biosynthetic <b>human</b> <b>insulin.</b> When the pH 4.0 solution is injected, most of the material precipitates and is not bioavailable. A small amount is immediately available for use, and the remainder is sequestered in subcutaneous tissue. As the glargine is used, small amounts of the precipitated material will move into solution in the bloodstream, and the basal level of insulin will be maintained up to 24 hours. The onset of action of subcutaneous insulin glargine is somewhat slower than NPH <b>human</b> <b>insulin.</b> It is clear solution as there is no zinc in formula.|$|E

25|$|Before biosynthetic human {{recombinant}} analogues were available, porcine insulin was chemically {{converted into}} <b>human</b> <b>insulin.</b> Chemical modifications of the amino acid side chains at the N-terminus and/or the C-terminus {{were made in}} order to alter the ADME characteristics of the analogue. Semisynthetic insulins were clinically used for some time based on chemical modification of animal insulins, for example Novo Nordisk enzymatically converted porcine insulin into semisynthetic 'human' insulin by removing the single amino acid that varies from the human variety, and chemically adding the human amino acid.|$|E
25|$|Within vertebrates, {{the amino}} acid {{sequence}} of insulin is strongly conserved. Bovine insulin differs from human in only three amino acid residues, and porcine insulin in one. Even insulin from some species of fish is similar enough to human to be clinically effective in humans. Insulin in some invertebrates is quite similar in sequence to <b>human</b> <b>insulin,</b> and has similar physiological effects. The strong homology seen in the insulin sequence of diverse species suggests {{that it has been}} conserved across much of animal evolutionary history. The C-peptide of proinsulin (discussed later), however, differs much more among species; it is also a hormone, but a secondary one.|$|E

Considering great psychological burden of diabetic patients, {{the purpose of this}} study was to assess the effect of different insulin treatment regimens, glycemic control and the presence of vascular complications on self-reported well-being and quality of life (QoL) of subjects with type 1 DM. Methods. The patients with type 1 DM (n = 122) recruited from the outpatient Diabetes Endocrinology Clinic of Zvezdara University Medical Center were divided into 4 groups according to the specific treatment regimen: 26 were on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), 30 on conventional insulin therapy, 33 on multiple daily injections (MDI) with <b>human</b> <b>insulins,</b> and 33 on MDI with insulin analogues. QoL was assessed by self-reported well-being with the following questionnaires: WHO- 5 item Well Being Index (WHO- 5), 36 item Short Form (SF- 36) survey, and Insulin Treatment Appraisal Scale (ITAS). Objective metabolic control was assessed by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c), lipid levels and the presence of vascular complications. Statistical analyses used in this crosssectional study included: descriptive statistics, Student’s t-test, Chisqare test, contingency tables, ANOVA and correlation methods. Results. The patients on CSII had significantly better metabolic control than all other treatment groups, especially when compared to the one on conventional therapy (CSII HbA 1 c 7. 07 ± 1. 48 % vs conventional therapy, HbA 1 c 10. 04 ± 1. 44; p = 0. 000). No significant difference in glycemic control was observed between patients on MDI with <b>human</b> <b>insulins</b> and insulin analogues. Good glycemic control significantly influenced the reported QoL.
