The colours appear in characteristic dapple style on large-format canvasses, under which shapes are silhouetted, apparently moving as if behind textured glass. The horizontally layered colours are broken up in irregular though rhythmic sequences, and in this way suggest the movement of an undetected being that is captured in a distortion akin to a wipe effect in photography. Something similar happens in the human images group of works in which figurative representation becomes an experimental sphere. The human images develop their suggestive power through serial sequencing and <b>dynamic</b> <b>distortion.</b> In their mask-like reproduction of almost identical forms, they run counter to any expression of unique personality, which differs from the classical portrait emphasizing one person‘s individuality. The human being mutates into a prototype, appearing in diverse variations within the serial arrangement and disappearing in the masses.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis article {{presents}} an improved {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) -synthesis method to predict <b>dynamic</b> <b>distortion.</b> A steady-state flow field is derived from a CFD solution, through which are acquired total pressure, density, turbulence kinetic energy and others in steady-state at an aerodynamic interface plane (AIP). Back-propagation artificial neural network (BP ANN) is used {{to find out the}} relationship between the measured flight turbulence and the CFD-computed turbulence parameters. The dynamic pressure is obtained by incorporating CFD-found total steady-state pressure with fluctuating pressure. Finally, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>distortion</b> is predicted by means of the synthesized dynamic pressure. The fairly good agreement between the computed inlet surface pressure and the flight test data bears out the reliability of CFD solution used in this article. To validate the proposed method, six sets of flight test data are used and the results show that the predicted <b>dynamic</b> <b>distortion</b> is well in line with the distortion displayed in flight tests. An examination of the traditional method is also accomplished and the comparison also shows that the proposed method is superior to the traditional one in higher consistency with flight test data...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} discussion and summary of static and <b>dynamic</b> track <b>distortions</b> in the HARP TPC {{in terms of}} physical origin, mathematical modelling and correction algorithms. `Static' distortions are constant with time, while `dynamic' distortions are distortions that occur only during the 400 ms long accelerator spill. The measurement of <b>dynamic</b> <b>distortions,</b> their mathematical modelling and the correction algorithms build on our understanding of static distortions. In the course of corroborating the validity of our static distortion corrections, their reliability and precision was further improved. <b>Dynamic</b> TPC <b>distortions</b> originate dominantly from the `stalactite' effect: a column of positive-ion charge starts growing at the begin of the accelerator spill, and continues growing with nearly constant velocity out from the sense-wire plane into the active TPC volume. However, the `stalactite' effect {{is not able to}} describe the distortions that are present already {{at the start of the}} spill and which have a sign opposite to the one of `stalactite' distortions.

This procedure combines Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and distortion synthesis analysis to obtain a prediction of peak <b>dynamic</b> <b>distortion</b> intensity and the associated instantaneous total pressure pattern. A prediction of the steady state total pressure pattern at the Aerodynamic Interface Plane is first obtained using an appropriate CFD flow solver. A corresponding inlet turbulence pattern is obtained from the CFD solution via a correlation linking root mean square (RMS) inlet turbulence to a formulation of several CFD parameters representative of flow turbulence intensity. This correlation was derived using flight data obtained from the NASA High Alpha Research Vehicle flight test program and several CFD solutions at conditions matching the flight test data. A distortion synthesis analysis is then performed on the predicted steady state total pressure and RMS turbulence patterns to yield a predicted value of <b>dynamic</b> <b>distortion</b> intensity and the associated instantaneous total pressure pattern...|$|E

40|$|Inhomogeneities of {{the main}} {{magnetic}} field cause geometric distortion in echo-planar imaging, a method central to functional MRI. A number of correction methods have been proposed, {{most of which are}} based on the acquisition of a fieldmap providing the local offsets to the main magnetic field. Here, accelerated multiecho echo-planar imaging is used, with echo times short enough to enable the construction of a fieldmap of comparable quality from the data themselves. This way, each volume in a time series can be unwarped using a fieldmap obtained from that volume, avoiding volume-to-volume field-motion interactions that invalidate reference data in conventional approaches that use a single, static, fieldmap. The combination of accelerated acquisition with <b>dynamic</b> <b>distortion</b> correction yields volumes with very low distortion at repetition times similar to conventional echo-planar imaging. The method is applied to data acquired at 3 and 7 T and is shown to effectively correct image geometry. Furthermore, it is shown that <b>dynamic</b> <b>distortion</b> correction yields better temporal signal stability than correction using a static fieldmap in the presence of subject motion.

The dynamic growths of the induced inflow perturbation across the rotor disk during different transient maneuvers, such as a step pitch or roll rate, a step climb rate and a step change of advance ratio are investigated by using a dynamic vortex tube analysis. Based on the vortex tube results, a rotor <b>dynamic</b> wake <b>distortion</b> model, which is expressed in terms of a set of ordinary differential equations, with rotor longitudinal and lateral wake curvatures, wake skew and wake spacing as states, is developed.
