These meat slices were flooded with a cell suspension of either Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterobacter agglomerans, or Moraxella osloensis in distilled water and adhesion allowed to occur. The adhesion experiments were also conducted on agar-covered slides {{to evaluate the}} effect {{of the nature of the}} substratum on adhesion. The non-adherent organisms found on either surface tested (meat or agar) were removed by <b>flushing</b> <b>liquid</b> over the slide. The slides were then incubated in a moist atmosphere at 30 °C. Once the presence of microcolonies had been established microscopically, the slides were mounted into flow chambers and the surface flushed with distilled water to ascertain the effects of bacterial proliferation on adhesion. In other experiments, the influence of acetic, citric, and lactic acid rinses on cell adhesion and subsequent cell proliferation was evaluated. Microcolony formation was shown to reduce the adhesion strength of Enterobacter agglomerans and, to a lesser extent, that of Moraxella osloensis while increasing that of Pseudomonas fluorescens. The probable determinant of adhesion strengths of microcolonies is exopolymer synthesis. A minimal decrease in bacterial adhesion and microcolony formation was observed with the use of organic acid rinses. The bactericidal activity and effect on bacterial proliferation increased with increasing concentration and rinse times of the organic acids. The extent of the adhesion reductions suggests that the preservation action of organic acids is due to cell death and not adhesion inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Weak {{organic acids}} and/or their salts were tested as soil washing or {{flushing}} agents for the ex- or in-situ remediation of soils polluted by heavy metals. Three soils naturally with heavy metals {{were used for}} the tea. The three soils were characterized as a clay loam, loam and sandy clay loam. Their organic matter, pH, saturated hydraulic conductivity, cation exchange capacity, particle density and heavy metal contents were also characterized. The different retention forms of heavy metals in all 3 soils were studied by sequential extraction. The clay loam was contaminated with Cr, Hg, Mn and Pb while the loam and sandy clay loam were contaminated with Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn. Weak organic adds and/or their salts and chelating agents (EDTA and DTPA) were used at different pH, levels of concentration and leaching time in batch experiments to establish optimum conditions for maximum removal of heavy metals from the three soils. Citrate and tartarate were found to be quite effective, in leaching heavy metals from these soils. The rate of leaching of heavy metals from soils with citrate, tartarate and EDTA was modeled using two-reaction model at a constant pH and temperature. Three contaminated soils of different textures were flushed in a column at optimum pH with a salt of weak organic acids, namely, citrate, tartarate, citrate+oxalate or a chelating agent such as EDTA and DTPA. The citrate and tartarate (ammonium salts) were found to be quite effective in removing heavy metals from the three contaminated soils while leaching little macronutrients and improving the soil's structure. An in-situ soil remediation simulation was also successfully tested using the sandy clay loam at large scale level in a tub (plastic container) using citrate as a <b>flushing</b> <b>liquid.</b> EDTA and DTPA were effective in removing the heavy metals except for Hg, but these strong chelating agents extracted important quantities of macronutrients from the soil. These chelating agents are also known to pollute the soil by being adsorbed on the soil particles. A bioremediation process was developed using the fungus Aspergillus niger to produce weak organic acids (mainly citrate and partly oxalate depending on pH) for the leaching of heavy metals from contaminated soils. The fungus was cultivated {{on the surface of the}} three contaminated soils for 15 days at 30 °C and a pH ≤ 4 to enhance the production of citric acid rather than oxalic acid which hinders Pb leaching. By extrapolating the result, the three contaminated soils were expected to be sufficiently remediated to meet the A category (Quebec clean up criteria for cleaning soils contaminated by heavy metals) after 20 to 25 days of leaching using this technique. Finally, the leachate, collected following the soil remediation using weak organic acids and/or their salts, EDTA and DTPA was treated effectively using granular activated carbon...|$|E

Results showed that plants fertilized with animal based liquid fertilizers exhibited higher total biomass with a more profuse development of new developing organs (leaves and fibrous roots). Liquid organic fertilization resulted in an increased uptake of macro and micronutrients compared to mineral fertilized trees. Moreover, organic fertilization positively affected the carbohydrate content (fructose, glucose and sucrose) mainly in summer <b>flush</b> leaves. <b>Liquid</b> organic fertilization also resulted in an increase of soil organic matter content.

Strategies to reduce water consumption are becoming ever more important in order to minimize future water shortages. One such approach is to focus upon the publicly supplied sector of water use, which includes households and also large-scale commercial and industrial enterprises such as schools, hospitals, airports, and private firms. If such enterprises were to implement water-saving appliances and fixtures on a large scale, substantial water savings could be realized. One such water-saving appliance is the dual-flush toilet, which uses a high-volume flush for solid waste and a lower-volume <b>flush</b> for <b>liquid</b> waste. This thesis uses the principles of behavioral economics, which studies human behavior and decision-making, in order to determine whether the design of the dual flush mechanism can lead the user to make the incorrect 'choice' and thus waste water. A field experiment performed in the public restrooms of a municipal building in Columbia, Missouri definitively showed {{that in the case of}} one particular model of dual flush toilet, the Sloan Uppercut®, water usage was considerably higher than the manufacturer's projections. This was due to the fact that the default option, pushing the flush handle down, resulted in a large flush. While Sloan predicted a 2 : 1 urination-to-defecation (U/D) flush ratio, the observed ratio during the control period was roughly 1 : 4. The treatment period consisted of adding multiple signs to each stall that instructed users on how to use the toilets correctly; however, even with signs added, the U/D ratio only increased to 2 : 5. The implications of this research are that if water savings are to be fully maximized, the 'real-world' actions of users must be taken into account. These results are of particular relevance in areas where water is especially scarce and/or costly...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{for using the}} crop maize (Zea mays) {{for the production of}} biogas in simple anaerobic leach beds was evaluated. The results showed that leach beds coupled to high-rate methanogenic reactors performed better than other systems on a specific methane yield per gram of substrate added basis while their performance on a volumetric gas yield basis was poorer. Initial experiments using a single stage digester showed rapid acidification due to the low buffering capacity of the system. To overcome this problem, leach beds were used as part of a two-phase system in which the intermediate metabolic products were flushed out and used as substrate for a second stage methanogenic reactor. Further experiments simulated the effect of a hydraulic flush in the leach bed using clean water as the <b>flush</b> <b>liquid.</b> Methane potential of the leachate was estimated based on the cumulative soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) production. Under this operation mode, the effect of substrate to inoculum ratio, fresh substrate load (FSL), hydraulic retention time (HRT) and buffer and trace element addition was tested. The performance of the leach bed was found to be poor compared to conventional digesters where the methane yield is ~ 0. 35 l CH 4 g- 1 VSadded and volatile solids (VS) destruction is ~ 85 % and this was thought to be due to the low pH in the reactor. Increasing the FSL improved methane yield but the maximum value obtained was 0. 12 l CH 4 g- 1 VS. Decreasing the HRT allowed the leach bed to operate at a slightly higher pH. In this case, a volatile solids destruction of ~ 50 % and a methane yield of 0. 17 l CH 4 g- 1 VS was achieved using a HRT of 2. 6 days. The addition of buffer (NaHCO 3) to maintain pH ~ 6. 5 increased VS destruction to 89 % and methane yield to 0. 37 l CH 4 g- 1 VS at an HRT of 1. 5 days. This performance was similar at a HRT of 28 days despite the high VFA concentrations. Acid production increased with the addition of buffer as 75 - 97 % of SCOD was converted to this form. Buffering was also shown {{to increase the number of}} culturable anaerobic cellulolytic microorganisms. VS degradation and methane potential were further enhanced by the addition 0. 5 mg l- 1 of cobalt to the buffered flush medium giving an apparent VS destruction of 115 % and a methane yield of 0. 46 l CH 4 g- 1 VSadded, which indicated that a proportion of the inoculum was also degraded. In the final part of the research the leach beds were coupled to methanogenic reactors and trials were conducted using different feed cycle durations, in which all the digestate and leachate from the preceding run was used as inoculum, and only the solids destroyed were replaced with fresh feed material. The effect of the methanogenic reactor was multi-fold as it not only stripped out intermediate compounds, according to its primary design function, but also played an important role in stabilising pH, maintaining nutrients and retaining the microbial population in the system. The leach bed operated with a 7 -day feed cycle showed higher substrate degradation and was able to receive a higher OLR of 2. 4 gTS l- 1 reactor d- 1 than the 14 -day feed cycle at 1. 7 gTS l- 1 reactor d- 1 and the 28 -day feed cycle at 1. 3 gTS l- 1 reactor d- 1. This provided a higher volumetric methane yield the shorter the feed cycle, 0. 839 lCH 4 l- 1 d- 1, 0. 618 lCH 4 l- 1 d- 1 and 0. 482 lCH 4 l- 1 d- 1 in the 7 -day, 14 -day and 28 -day feed cycle, respectively. However, the specific methane yield obtained from the system was slightly higher in the 14 -day and 28 -day cycles at 0. 434 l CH 4 g- 1 VSadded while in the 7 -day cycle it was 0. 418 l CH 4 g- 1 VSadded. The retention of the digestate and leachate over successive cycles for a period of ~ 160 days appeared, however, to cause an accumulation of suspended solids (SS) and total and soluble COD in the leachate. This was especially the case in the higher loaded 7 -day feed cycle reactor and was probably the cause of the lower methane production. Initially the methanogenic reactors were responsible for most methane production but with progressive cycles the leach beds themselves became methanogenic and eventually accounted for more than 50 % of the methane generated in the system. The methanogenic and cellulolytic bacteria were shown to be present in the leachate from both reactors and suggested a synergy between them in exchange of microbial consortia.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{describes the}} experiments on pulse induction by cycling the liquid feed {{in a column}} of 3. 2 m height. Based on a square-wave cycled liquid feed, two feed strategies are developed that involve the artificial induction of natural pulses and a separation of the wetting efficiency in time. The feed strategies aim at increasing the mass transfer rate of the limiting reactant and to prevent flow maldistribution and hot spot formation. The feed strategies are categorized upon a relatively fast and slow cycling of the liquid feed. The potential consequences of the developed feed strategies on reactor performance are evaluated. Cycling the liquid feed results {{in the formation of}} continuity shock waves in the column. The shock waves decay by leaving liquid behind their tail. This decaying process limits the frequency of the cycled liquid feed to rather low values since at relatively high frequencies, total collapse of the shock waves occurs. By the induction of natural pulses inside the shock waves, the integral mass and heat transfer rates during the <b>liquid</b> <b>flush</b> will be improved. Shorter flushes can therefore be applied and the usual encountered periodic operation is optimized. This feed strategy is termed the slow mode of liquid-induced pulsing flow. The second feed strategy termed the fast mode of liquid-induced pulsing flow may be viewed as an extension of natural pulsing flow. Individual natural pulses are induced at an externally set pulse frequency less than 1 Hz. This feed strategy is the only fast mode of periodic operation possible since pulses are stable while shock waves decay. The characteristics of the induced pulses equal the pulse characteristics of natural pulsing flow at equivalent gas flow rates. A critical liquid holdup in between pulses is necessary for the induced pulses to remain stable...|$|R

The effects of commonly used manure treatments on {{the persistence of}} these pathogens have rarely been compared. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the persistence of artificially inoculated M. paratuberculosis, as well as other naturally occurring pathogens, during the treatment of dairy manure under conditions that simulate three commonly used manure management methods: thermophilic composting at 55 °C, manure packing at 25 °C (or low-temperature composting), and liquid lagoon storage. Straw and sawdust amendments used for composting and packing were also compared. Manure was obtained from a large Ohio free-stall dairy herd and was inoculated with M. paratuberculosis at 106 CFU/g in the final mixes. For compost and pack treatments, this manure was amended with sawdust or straw to provide an optimal moisture content (60 %) for composting for 56 days. To simulate liquid storage, water was added to the manure (to simulate <b>liquid</b> <b>flushing</b> and storage) and the slurry was placed in triplicate covered 4 -liter Erlenmeyer flasks, incubated under ambient conditions for 175 days. The treatments were sampled on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 for the detection of pathogens. The persistence of M. paratuberculosis was also assessed by a PCR hybridization assay. After 56 days of composting, from 45 to 60 % of the carbon in the compost treatments was converted to CO 2, while no significant change in carbon content was observed in the liquid slurry. Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Listeria were all detected in the manure and all of the treatments on day 0. After 3 days of composting at 55 °C, none of these organisms were detectable. In liquid manure and pack treatments, some of these microorganisms were detectable up to 28 days. M. paratuberculosis was detected by standard culture only on day 0 in all the treatments, but was undetectable in any treatment at 3 and 7 days. On days 14, 28, and 56, M. paratuberculosis was detected in the liquid storage treatment but remained undetectable in the compost and pack treatments. However, M. paratuberculosis DNA was detectable through day 56 in all treatments and up to day 175 in liquid storage treatments. Taken together, the results indicate that high-temperature composting is more effective than pack storage or liquid storage of manure in reducing these pathogens in dairy manure. Therefore, thermophilic composting is recommended for treatment of manures destined for pathogen-sensitive environments such as those for vegetable production, residential gardening, or application to rapidly draining fields...|$|R
40|$|The Main Magnetite Layer (MML) {{from the}} Northern, Eastern and Western lobes of the Bushveld Complex shows {{significant}} differences in textures and in mineral chemistry. The MML in the Eastern and Western lobes is massive, with rare, small and altered pyroxene inclusions. By contrast, the MML in the Northern Lobe is more heterogeneous, and it is made of anastomosed and sometimes imbricated, thin layers of magnetitite, magnetite-rich and silicate-rich rocks, where the inclusions in Ti-magnetite are more numerous and consist of mainly altered subhedral and anhedral plagioclase. The comparison of the maximum values of the oxides shows that the MML in the Northern Lobe has the highest content of V 2 O 3 (1. 97 wt%), TiO 2 (22. 49 wt%) and MgO (2. 92 wt%), while the MML in the Eastern Lobe has the highest content of Cr 2 O 3 (2. 92 wt%) and Al 2 O 3 (9. 80 wt%), but lowest V 2 O 3 (0. 52 wt%). The lower TiO 2 content and higher V 2 O 3 content in the MML of the Northern and Western Lobes suggest lower oxidising conditions during the crystallization of oxides. The MML in all three studied lobes consists of two layers of magnetitite, suggesting that MML was formed by two separate magma influxes, probably on a diverse and complex type of magma chamber floor. The high TiO 2 content in magnetite, together with the negative correlation between TiO 2 and V 2 O 3 suggest that the maximum V content should represent a “less evolved” and less oxidized melt. In this respect, higher concentrations V 2 O 3 in magnetite can be expected in magnetitite layers with lower TiO 2. It can be inferred that the Ti-magetite in the MML from the Eastern Lobe was formed from a more evolved (TiO 2 and FeO enriched) and more oxidized (lower V 2 O 3) melt, compared with the MML from the Northern and Western lobes. These findings {{can be used to}} illustrate: a) that high fO 2 can be responsible for the relatively low V content in magnetite from Fe-Ti oxide ores and b) the vanadium in magnetite decreases significantly in more evolved cumulates, due to a decreasing fO 2 with differentiation. Compositional profiles of Ti- magnetite along the stratigraphic height of the MML in the Eastern Lobe (composed of two layers, separated in the outcrop by a parting plane) depicts a cryptic variation with depth in each of the two layers, where each layer can be divided into four sublayers, labelled upwards as A, B, C (with C 1, C 2, C 3 and C 4) and D based on Cr, Mg, Ti, Al and V variation. Small scale reversals of the mentioned elements and the repetition of A, B, C and D sub-layers in each layer suggest that MML formed from two successive influxes of magma (indicated by relatively elevated values of MgO), which evolved by crystallization and cooling in a similar manner, to produce the A to D variation. Based on these observations and theoretical considerations, this study dismisses several models for the genesis of the MML: the immiscibility, the increased oxygen fugacity, the relative increase of H 2 O content of the melt, pressure variation within the magma chamber, magma mixing, and crustal rock contamination. The model proposed here for MML genesis involves the crystallization of both Ti-magnetite and ilmenite from a Fe-Ti-Ca-Al-rich melt (ferro-diorite) along its line of descent, and gravitational settling of oxides in a dynamic regime. The factor which triggered the crystallization of magnetite is a critical saturation of melt in magnetite (attaining saturation of magnetite and ilmenite in the melt after some silicates crystallized). The difference between the nature of silicate inclusions in magnetite {{and the nature of the}} magnetite floor, suggest that the Fe-rich magma was not in equilibrium with the cumulates from the present floor, but rather it was emplaced laterally on long distances, the melt being disrupted from its own cumulates. The absence of correlation between the Cr 2 O 3 in magnetite and co-existing ilmenite can indicate than no in-situ fractional crystallization took place at the moment of magnetite accumulation, but rather that magnetite and ilmenite gravitationally accumulated and the grains mechanically mixed from a flowing magma. The model presented herein proposes a five stage model of MML formation: Stage 1 is represented by the intrusion of a Fe-T-Ca-Al-rich magma which expands laterally within a flat and thin magma chamber. Oxides start to crystallize within a dynamic regime of the magma. Stage 2 is given by the accumulation of oxides at the bottom of the new floor. Some plagioclase starts to crystallize (e. g. subhedral plagioclase in the MML of the Northern Lobe). Stage 3 is a short living static regime, where both plagioclase and magnetite crystallized, without fractionation, forming the thin magnetite-anorthosite layer separating the MML into two layers. Stage 4 is represented by a new influx of Fe-Ti-Ca-Al-rich magma which is emplaced above the magnetite-bearing anorthosite, <b>flushing</b> out the <b>liquid</b> which was in equilibrium with the anorthosite. The oxides started crystallizing in a dynamic regime, as in Stage 1. In stage 5, the accumulation of oxides produced the upper layer of the MML. Our interpretation is that the flow of the magma was more dynamic (probably more turbulent on long distances) in the MML of the Northern Lobe, compared to the MML in the Western and Eastern lobes, producing highly heterogeneous and imbricated thin layers of magnetitite and silicates. The presence of olivine corona around orthopyroxene suggests the incongruent melting of orthopyroxene, which points out towards a local re-heating of existing silicate layers, this being a strong argument for multiple injections in generation of MML. Massive crystallization of oxides produced the sulphur saturation of the magma and caused the precipitation of the igneous sulphides, which nucleated on the existing oxides. Later hydrothermal fluids (and/or late magmatic volatiles?) percolated the MML, producing chloritization of the included silicates, remobilization of igneous sulphides and precipitation of hydrothermal sulphides...|$|R
