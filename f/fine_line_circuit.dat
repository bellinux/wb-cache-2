40|$|With the {{decrease}} {{in the size of}} fine circuit lines/spaces, some problems may emerge such as the lack of continuity in the <b>fine</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>lines</b> and poor insulation between <b>circuit</b> <b>lines.</b> These quality and reliability problems are also related to the fabrication process. Laser structuring, a new technique, is used in the fabrication of fine circuit lines/spaces in this work. Fine circuit lines/spaces fabricated in this technique will be tested in an electrical test, a peel test and a surface insulation test. The minimum lines/spaces with good quality and reliability in our research is 25 / 45 µm. These test results will drive the further development and wider usage of the laser structuring technique.

40|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and {{methylchloroform}} (MCF) {{have been}} widely used in the electronics industry for many decades. However, the growing concern regarding their ozone depletion properties has demanded possible ban on these chemicals and consequently brought forth the search for environmentally friendly alternatives. This paper describes the strategy, alternative approaches and the successful implementation of a novel process for making <b>fine</b> <b>line</b> multilayer <b>circuit</b> boards employing MCF free process. In printed circuit board technology, MCF has been widely utilized as a solvent for developing radiation sensitive materials useful in creating <b>fine</b> <b>line</b> circuitry patterns. This solvent was used as a developer for solvent based photoresists. The aqueous resist compatible with extremely alkaline media is not available in the market. The necessity to eliminate the use of MCF provided thus the impetus to finding an alternative suitable solvent. The new solvents must meet specific manufacturing and environmental requirements with respect to flammability, toxicity, ability to recycle, simplicity of composition and compatibility with a spectrum of photoresists and subsequent processes. After evaluating numerous alternative solvents, a process based on a cyclic ester was developed as a substitute for MCF. Low boiling solvent such as methanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, were not considered for manufacturing process either due to flammability, toxicity or high emission rate. Cyclic ester having high boiling point, high flash point and listed as combustible were evaluated for flammability. Fire test results indicated that these cyclic esters under atomized conditions (spray process) change the physical state of the solvent and thus become flammable and normally ignite in the presence of ignition source and sufficient oxygen. This novel ester based process has been successfully implemented in both IBM-Endicott NY, USA and IBM-Sindelfingen, Germany manufacturing sites resulting in the elimination of MCF as a developer in photolithographic processes in manufxturing of thermal conduction module (TCM) raw boards...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Class A {{and class}} AB {{operational}} amplifiers are {{an essential part}} of a mixed- signal chip, where they are used as active filter sub-blocks, compensators, reference current generators and voltage buffers, {{to name just a few}} of many applications. For analog circuits such as operational amplifiers a mixed-signal chip is a very unfriendly operating environment, where the power supply is often corrupted by high current switching circuits. In addition, power supply voltages for analog blocks are shrinking, because of the deployment of new battery technologies and <b>fine</b> <b>line</b> length integrated <b>circuit</b> processes, which can reduce the amplifier dynamic range a problem requiring supply insensitive low voltage compatible amplifier topologies and other analog blocks. The aims of this thesis were to further develop the low voltage compatible class AB amplifier topologies published earlier by other authors, to improve their bandwidth efficiency by means of re-examining two- and three-stage amplifier compensation techniques and to find solutions for enhancing the high frequency power supply noise rejection performance of class A and class AB amplifiers without degrading their signal path stability. The class AB amplifier cores presented here improve the amplifier’s power supply noise insensitivity at high frequencies and increase bandwidth efficiency when compared to the commonly used two-stage Miller compensated amplifier, enabling the construction of better buffers and more power-efficient and reliable low voltage mixed signal chips...|$|R

40|$|To achieve higher {{efficiencies}} without extra-cost is {{the major}} goal {{of research and development}} in crystalline silicon solar cell production technology. This goal can be addressed by <b>fine</b> <b>line</b> printing. Therefore, the focus of this work will be the combination of <b>fine</b> <b>line</b> printed front contacts and high emitter sheet resistances. A detailed study of <b>fine</b> <b>line</b> front contacts is presented. Therefore, an electrical analysis based on solar cell results as well as an optical analysis based on microscope pictures are carried out. Furthermore, the contact characteristic of different silver pastes {{as a function of the}} emitter sheet resistance is analyzed. As additional approach <b>fine</b> <b>line</b> printed front contacts as seed layer for a two-step metallization are discussed within this work. Both concepts, the one- and two-step metallization, will be compared with each other. Moreover, the use of MWT (metal wrap through) solar cells [1] allows a further efficiency increase [2]. Hence, MWT solar cells with <b>fine</b> <b>line</b> screen printed front contacts are developed and characterized in this paper. Efficiencies up to 16. 8 % are realized with mc-Si MWT solar cells...|$|R
