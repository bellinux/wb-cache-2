The car was driven off the production line by the pop singer Lulu, and was subsequently housed at the Heritage Motor Centre in Gaydon, alongside the first Mini Mark <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>made.</b> The new generation Mini Hatch/Hardtop went on sale in July 2001 and was an immediate sales success.|$|E
25|$|The {{large-scale}} exhibition {{included the}} full range of Emin's art from the rarely seen early work to the iconic My Bed (1998) and the room-sized installation Exorcism of the Last Painting <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Made</b> (1996). The show displayed her unique appliquéd blankets, paintings, sculptures, films, neons, drawings and monoprints. The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art was the only UK venue for the show which then went to the Centro de Arte Contemporáneo in Málaga, Spain and then to the Kunstmuseum in Bern, Switzerland from 2009.|$|E
500|$|Speaking of {{the album}} cover, Ranaldo said: [...] "in some ways the whole album started with the cover photo, and I kind of built it up from there. A young Canadian {{photographer}} took that photo of me in September 2010 during an interview session about legendary Canadian group The Nihilist Spasm Band. When I saw the photo I thought it looked so much like a cool album cover. At that point I only had three or four acoustic demos going, and it remained {{in the back of}} my mind that if <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>made</b> enough songs for an album, I’d use that pic as the cover. So that helped push me to develop the songs." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1951, Tracy portrayed {{a lawyer}} in The People Against O'Hara. The next year he re-teamed with Hepburn for the sports comedy Pat and Mike (1952), the second feature written {{expressly}} for the pair by Kanin and Gordon. Pat and Mike {{became one of the}} duo's most popular and critically acclaimed films. Tracy followed it with Plymouth Adventure (1952), a historical drama set abroad the Mayflower, co-starring Gene Tierney. It met with a poor response and posted a loss of $1.8 million. In 1953, Tracy returned to the role of a concerned father in The Actress. [...] "That film... got more [...] from the critics than any film <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>made</b> in all the years, and we didn't make enough to pay for the ushers in the theatre," [...] recalled producer Lawrence Weingarten. For his performance in The Actress, Tracy won a Golden Globe Award and received a nomination for the British Academy Film Award (BAFTA) [...]|$|E
500|$|On March 29 against Kansas, Burke {{recorded}} his fourth career double-double, with 23 points and 10 assists. He scored all 23 {{points in the}} second half and overtime, including a game-tying deep three-pointer with 4.2 seconds remaining. Burke describes the [...] shot as [...] "...probably the biggest shot <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>made</b> and definitely a shot I'll always remember." [...] He also scored a layup with his team trailing by 5 points with 21 seconds remaining. Burke scored eight points in the final 1:15 of regulation time, as Michigan posted a 14–4 run in the final 2:52 to force overtime. He also gave the team its first lead since very early in the game in overtime with a three-point shot. It marked {{the first time that a}} player had 20 or more points and 10 or more assists in a Sweet Sixteen game since Billy Donovan did so in the 1986 tournament for Rick Pitino's [...] In the regional finals on March 31 against the Donovan-coached Florida Gators, Burke contributed 15 points, 7 assists, 3 steals and a career-high 8 rebounds. Burke was named South Regional Tournament Most Outstanding Player. He was joined on the 5-man South All-Regional team by teammates [...] Mitch McGary and Nik Stauskas. Burke also earned ESPN.com Player of the Week recognition. Although Burke admits that the team he led, with three starting freshman and no seniors, was young, he said that was no excuse pointing at the 2012 tournament champions, Kentucky, saying [...] "You saw what Kentucky did last year. We felt that being young isn’t an excuse for not going far in the tournament." [...] Burke scored 24 points in the April 8, championship game against Louisville and made the 7-man All-Tournament team (which was revised multiple times) along with teammates McGary and Albrecht. The turning point of the game was described as a missed call by the referees when as Michigan trailed 67–64 with 5 minutes left, Burke pinned Peyton Siva's dunk attempt with a clean all-ball block, but was called for a foul resulting in two made free throws by Siva. Michigan never got closer than 4 points the rest of the game. Burke finished his sophomore season with 1,231 points, surpassing the former school record for sophomore season career point total of 1,218 by Chris Webber. His final total of 260 assists established the Michigan career record, and his average of 6.7 assists per game led the Big Ten.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{northern}} winter of 1893/94, Slocum undertook {{what he described}} as at that time being [...] "the hardest voyage that <b>I</b> have <b>ever</b> <b>made,</b> without any exception at all."

2500|$|Ironically, the 1970s {{came to a}} {{close with}} the {{decision}} by then-general manager Buzzie Bavasi to allow Ryan to become a free agent. At the time, Bavasi remarked that Ryan, whose 1979 record was 16–14 (Ryan was 26–27 under Bavasi), could be replaced [...] "with two pitchers who go 8–7." [...] Bavasi later admitted this was [...] "the worst mistake <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>made</b> in all my years in baseball." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, Rice and Bob Heick of the American Front were photographed for Sassy Magazine wearing {{uniforms and}} brandishing knives. While Rice would later recall it as a prank, the photo has caused boycotts and protests {{at many of}} Rice's appearances. When asked if he regrets the photo, Rice stated, [...] "I don't care. I don't think <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>made</b> a wrong move. The bad stuff is just good. America loves its villains".|$|E
5000|$|Joaquin Phoenix {{commented on}} the documentary, [...] "Of all the films <b>I</b> have <b>ever</b> <b>made,</b> {{this is the one}} that gets people talking the most.

500|$|For Streep, {{the most}} {{significant}} thing about the film was that [...] "his was the first time, on any movie <b>I</b> have <b>ever</b> <b>made,</b> where men {{came up to me}} and said, 'I know what you felt like, this is kind of like my life.' That was for me the most ground-breaking thing about Devil Wears Prada—it engaged men on a visceral level," [...] she told Indiewire.|$|R
2500|$|Marshall {{entered into}} a 15-year {{distribution}} deal with British company Rose-Morris during 1965, which gave him the capital to expand his manufacturing operations, though it {{would prove to be}} costly. In retrospect, Marshall admitted the Rose-Morris deal was [...] "the biggest mistake <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>made.</b> Rose-Morris hadn't a clue, really. For export, they added 55% onto my price, which pretty much priced us out of the world market for a long time." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{received}} {{an offer from}} David Lean to play the lead role in an adaptation of The Wind Cannot Read by Richard Mason. More was unsure about whether the public would accept him in the part and turned it down, a decision he later regarded as [...] "the greatest mistake <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>made</b> professionally". (Lean dropped the project and {{was not involved in}} the eventual 1958 film version which starred Dirk Bogarde and was directed by Thomas).|$|E
2500|$|Pickford {{left the}} stage to join Zukor's roster of stars. Zukor {{believed}} film's potential lay in recording theatrical players in replicas of their most famous stage roles and productions. Zukor first filmed Pickford in a silent version of A Good Little Devil. The film, produced in 1913, showed the play's Broadway actors reciting every line of dialogue, resulting in a stiff film that Pickford later called [...] "one of the worst [...] <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>made</b> ... it was deadly". Zukor agreed; he held the film back from distribution for a year.|$|E

2500|$|Between {{the morning}} bike ride {{and the late}} {{afternoon}} tightrope walk, Wallenda's father and safety coordinator Terry passed out {{from a combination of}} heat and stress and was rushed to the hospital. [...] Performing without his father watching [...] "was one of the hardest decisions <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>made</b> in my life", Wallenda said, [...] "but my family history and my family tradition is that the show must go on." [...] It {{was the first time in}} his career that he performed without the assistance of his father. [...] In addition, he had to battle rain, strong winds, and lightning in the area to complete the feats.|$|E
2500|$|Hofmann started drag racing on the East Coast of the United States. He went to Australia {{twice for}} a three-month visit. [...] "Those trips {{were a good}} thing for me," [...] said Hofmann. [...] "Not only did I win a couple of championships, but I got the chance to meet the people from Blower Drive Service from Whittier, California. They thought I had some {{potential}} and backed it up with $100,000 in sponsorship funding." [...] Hofmann added, [...] "That allowed me to hire Tom Anderson as a crew chief, one of the best moves <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>made.</b> It was impossible for me to do both the driving and tuning by myself, and Tom had a lot more experience anyway. We ended up winning a lot of races together." ...|$|E
2500|$|While at {{the head}} of AMC, Chapin spearheaded the {{acquisition}} of Jeep from the Kaiser Motors Division of Kaiser Industries in 1970. According to Chapin: [...] "Perhaps the easiest decision <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>made</b> was the purchase of Jeep from Kaiser in 1970. I tried to buy it when George Romney (later Michigan governor) and Roy Abernethy were running AMC. Romney and Edgar Kaiser couldn't get along. I was running the international operations under Abernethy and I was following Jeep around. When they put up a plant, I followed with a Rambler plant because it worked like a charm. Where Jeep was, there were roads and gasoline. Abernethy didn't go for the idea and the first thing I did when I became chairman and got a little money was to buy Jeep. We got it for a song, about $75 million..." [...] American Motors' engineers and designers quickly overhauled Jeep and expanded its lineup, creating a valuable asset that attracted Renault, Chrysler, and ultimately DaimlerBenz AG.|$|E

That is why I do not like the idea of your going out with him. It doesn't seem to be right--and I am afraid." ...|$|R
2500|$|Gradishar, who {{graduated}} {{with a degree in}} Distributive Education, was a three-year starter with the Ohio State University from 1971 to 1973.

50|$|His 1993 album Time to Move On {{failed to}} produce any major successes, but his 1989 Greatest Hits {{collection}} has been a steady seller over the years, and his 1997 compilation Love <b>Is</b> For <b>Ever</b> <b>made</b> No. 7 on the UK album chart. Ocean's last studio album for Jive Records was Time to Move On, which he recorded in Chicago with R&B star R. Kelly. R. Kelly had been a longtime admirer of the way Ocean was able to mix the more emotive soul style with a crossover popular style.|$|R
2500|$|Despite his solo {{success and}} {{previous}} issues with band members, Morrissey still {{expressed interest in}} a Smiths reunion. On 22 December 1988, Morrissey, Andy Rourke, Mike Joyce and Craig Gannon performed to a sold out Wolverhampton Civic Hall. This would serve as his first solo show, and also the last Smiths live show ever. Many of those in attendance had waited for days to gain admission. After Viva Hate, Morrissey put out two new singles; [...] "The Last of the Famous International Playboys" [...] was about the Kray twins, gangsters who operated in London's East End, and reached number 6 on the UK singles chart. This was followed by [...] "Interesting Drug", which reached number 9. After his songwriting partnership with Street ended {{and was replaced by}} Alan Winstanley and Clive Langer, he recorded [...] "Ouija Board, Ouija Board", released as a single in November 1989; it reached number 18. Christian spokespeople and tabloid newspapers condemned the song, claiming that it promoted occultism, to which Morrissey responded that [...] "the only contact <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> <b>made</b> with the dead was when I spoke to a journalist from The Sun." ...|$|E

5000|$|Cave {{has agreed}} a new two-year deal with Ulster in December 2012, keeping {{him at the}} Irish {{province}} until the summer of 2015. He told Ulster's website: [...] "Signing this new contract was probably the easiest decision that <b>I</b> have <b>ever</b> <b>made</b> in my life, especially {{at a time when}} the team have just won 12 competitive matches in a row. I honestly think that Ulster are going to win something between now and the summer of 2015 and I would never forgive myself if I wasn't around to be a part of that.|$|R
2500|$|Cain {{himself was}} {{very pleased with the}} way his book turned out on the screen. After seeing the picture half a dozen times he was quoted as saying, [...] "...It's the only picture <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> saw <b>made</b> from my books that had things in it I wish I had thought of. Wilder's ending was much better than my ending, and his device for letting the guy tell the story by taking out the office dictating machine – I would have done it if I had thought of it." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} day, loyalists expelled 500 Catholic {{workers from}} the nearby Harland and Wolff shipyard.
