40|$|External {{spur gear}} pumps are {{exceedingly}} useful components in common hydraulic systems. The main issue with <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> {{is that all}} current models are limited to only fixed-displacement. This means that for every revolution of the gears inside the pump, a set amount of fluid will always be displaced. Consequently, <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> are limited in their use because they can only operate at full throttle causing inefficiencies when reduced displacement is needed. The successful procurement of a variable displacement gear pump will allow a more efficient use of hydraulic systems, {{such as in the}} displacement controlled systems used in some heavy construction equipment. In this research approach, the displacement is varied by changing the timing of the gears inside the pump. More specifically, changing the timing of the gears’ connections with the inlet and outlet grooves alters the available volume in the gears’ spaces, subsequently varying the displacement. With this in mind, additional research was conducted to develop an actuation system for the aforementioned process.

A number of graphite, carbon nanotube (CNT) and carbon nanofiber (CNF) dispersions in ethanol were prepared with concentrations ranging from 194 - 1500 ppm. The fluids were investigated in an <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> with a maximum operating pressure of 100 psi. Pump inlet pressure, volumetric flow rate, and electric power consumption data were recorded over a range of pump discharge pressures. The power consumed by the motor at a given differential pump pressure was found to remain approximately constant for all additive concentrations. It was found that increases in both volumetric flow rate and overall pump efficiency were observed when pure ethanol {{was replaced by the}} colloidal suspensions. This was attributed to a roller bearing effect caused by the alignment and self-lubrication of the colloidal additives when confined to micro-scale clearances between the gear surfaces. It was found that that pump performance was also a function on the CNT aspect ratio and could very from pump to pump, or even after a pump was disassembled and reassembled. This indicates that the clearance geometry between the gears and between the housing may play a critical role. To examine any potential structural changes in the additives, environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) images of the additives were obtained before and after extended run periods within the pump. The results indicate that graphite and CNTs retained significant resilience, i. e. no breakage and deformation was observed. However, the very long aspect ratio CNFs appear to have undergone some scission. To examine any issues with filterability, iii graphite and CNT suspensions were run through two filters of different size and composition and the filters where then qualitatively examined using ESEM images. The results indicate that a considerable amount of the additives were filtered from the suspension. This indicates that filterability is an issue {{that needs to be addressed}} if these suspensions were to be used in industrial applications...|$|R

In fact the reduction of flow pulsations {{is one of the}} crucial targets in the development of these machines. The fluid dynamic model of the pump is based on a finite volumes framework: each chamber presents uniform fluid proprieties and is connected with the adjoining ones by variable orifices. The pump is described by the interaction between a fluid dynamic model, that predicts the instantaneous pressures and the flow rates between the chambers, with a geometrical sub-model for the evaluation of the actual values of the variable volumes (defined by teeth, housing, and side wear plates) and the throat areas, as functions of the shaft angular position. This paper reports a deep description of the fluid dynamic model and a comparison between its numerical results and data available from experiments, showing how a correct evaluation of the flow when the chambers expand (and oil is pushed from the supply tank) or decrease (and oil is ejected into the outlet port) allows a good prediction of the pump characteristics.

40|$|The {{numerical}} analysis of an <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> with cavitation effects has been validated with experimental {{data obtained by}} applying Time-Resolved Particle Image Velocimetry. The effect of inlet and outlet pressure on volumetric efficiency has been studied numerically. First, the Particle Image Velocimetry method was {{used to analyze the}} two-dimensional velocity field in the middle plane of the suction chamber of the <b>gear</b> <b>pump.</b> The main improvement, with respect to previous similar analysis is the use of alginate micro particles as tracers. It is seen that the two-dimensional model is able to characterize the flow field of the real pump in the region of the inlet chamber in which cavitation is expected. In a previous study, it was seen that a cavitation cloud acted as a virtual contact point at low pressure, being responsible for an increase on the volumetric efficiency. The first set of simulations represents the pump working with high outlet pressure. Now, the cavitation cloud is not present and cavitation no longer helps to improve the efficiency of the pump. The second set of simulations represents the pump with an inlet loss factor, which implies a mean inlet pressure below atmospheric conditions. This allows cavitation clouds to propagate upstream. Despite the larger cavitation clouds, volumetric efficiency only drops at high operating velocities, when some clouds become trapped between gears and casing and are transported to the pressure side.
