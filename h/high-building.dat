A novel <b>high-building</b> escape device is designed based on TRIZ theory, which has the advantages of simple structure, easy operation and without electric or other energy. With the transformation of closed-loop mechanism, the gravity of escape person generate the resistance preventing the rapid drop of escape person. The closed-loop mechanism consists of driving shaft, feedback shaft, drving gear, feedback gear and rope. One {{end of the rope}} is winded around the driving shaft, and another end is tied with escape person. With the reduction of layers number of rope, the pressure angle between feedback shaft and rope increase, which cause the raise of resistance and the decrease of landing velocity of escape person. Simulation and experiment show that the designed escape device is effective and safety...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{teaching}} practices of surveying, control surveying or other surveying courses are mainly operated by manually from reading, recording, limit value checking to data calculation and comprehensive analysis. This way {{plays an important}} role in bringing up lots of excellent surveyors, but it has some disadvantages, such as time-consuming, low efficiency, making reading or calculating errors easily, and being scarce of integration of inside and outside work. Nowadays, our {{teaching practices}} of some surveying courses must also keep up with the times and be reformed. In recent years, thanks to georobot’s special capabilities, such as high-precision, real-time, automatic observation, automatic recording, automatic searching, tracking, identifying and collimating accurately targets etc., it has been applied in many fields, such as topographic survey, industrial survey, especially in the large-scale non-supervisor, all-day, all-orientation deformation automatic monitoring of dam, bridge, landside, underground, tunnel or other <b>high-building</b> etc [...] These special capabilities and applications of Georobot make it possible and necessary to set up a new course——Teaching Practice of Automatic Measurement with Georobot, which will provide new conditions and views for the practicer and make the...|$|E
