5|$|Despite {{striking}} {{differences in}} appearance, S.parthenopion {{may be most}} closely related to S.nicholsi. Like the diminutive S.parthenopion in the Virgin Islands, S.nicholsi, the smallest endemic sphaerodactylid in Puerto Rico, is very small. The <b>geographic</b> <b>range</b> of another species, S.townsendi, divides these two closely related populations, suggesting that S.townsendi evolved after S.parthenopion and S.nicholsi diverged.|$|E

5|$|Although no {{subspecies}} are recognized, {{there are}} morphological differences in wood turtles between areas. Individuals {{found in the}} west of its <b>geographic</b> <b>range</b> (areas like the Great Lakes and the Midwest United States) have a paler complexion {{on the inside of}} the legs and underside of the neck than ones found in the east (places including the Appalachian Mountains, New York, and Pennsylvania). Genetic analysis has also revealed that southern populations have less genetic diversity than the northern; however, both exhibit a fair amount of diversity considering the decline in numbers that have occurred during previous ice ages.|$|E
5|$|Although the camas {{pocket gopher}} is {{fiercely}} defensive when cornered, {{it may become}} tame in captivity. While population trends are generally stable, threats to the species' survival include urbanization, habitat conversion for agricultural use and active attempts at eradication with trapping and poisons. It is prey for raptors and carnivorous mammals, and host to several parasitic arthropods and worms. Scientists believe that the gopher's evolutionary history was disrupted when the Missoula Floods washed over the Willamette Valley {{at the end of}} the last ice age. The floods almost completely inundated its <b>geographic</b> <b>range,</b> which may have caused a genetic bottleneck as survivors repopulated the region after the waters receded.|$|E
5|$|If truly a gondwanathere, TNM02067 {{extends the}} known <b>geographic</b> <b>range</b> {{of the group}} {{to another part of}} Gondwana, the African mainland. The {{uncertain}} age of locality TZ-07 renders a precise assessment of the significance of TNM02067 difficult. It may well be older than the oldest previously known gondwanathere, the Campanian Gondwanatherium. It also has implications for the hypothesis that Africa was isolated from the rest of Gondwana from an early dateas early as the early Cretaceousand consequently had a fauna distinct from the rest of Gondwana for much of the Cretaceous, as it may be closely related to the sudamericids of South America, India, Madagascar, and Antarctica, a highly derived group.|$|E

5|$|New {{material}} from the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah, in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, includes a skull and partial skeleton that represent the species G. monumentensis. Its skull was more robust {{than that of the}} other species, and its predentary had enlarged prongs along its upper margin, where the lower jaw's beak was based. This new species greatly expands the <b>geographic</b> <b>range</b> of this genus, and there may be a second, more lightly built species present as well. Multiple gryposaur species are known from the Kaiparowits Formation, represented by cranial and postcranial remains, and were larger than their northern counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{found only}} {{on the island of}} Virgin Gorda, it has since been {{reported}} on Tortola and Moskito Island. Its range is sometimes estimated to encompass the entire British Virgin Islands, although the original expedition by Thomas did not find any specimens on Tortola, Anegada, or other smaller islands, nor in the United States Virgin Islands of Saint Croix, Saint Thomas, and Saint John. Its distribution is considered unusual because despite being separated from its closest relative, S.nicholsi in Puerto Rico, another species, the Puerto Rican Crested Toad (Bufo lemur), has a <b>geographic</b> <b>range</b> that includes both islands, yet it has not diverged.|$|E
5|$|Tatuidris tatusia is {{the only}} species in Tatuidris, a {{monotypic}} genus and {{one of only two}} extant genera in the subfamily Agroecomyrmecinae. A new species, T. kapasi, was described by Lacau & Groc in 2012, but has now been relegated to a junior synonym under T. tatusia based on the extent of the morphological variability encountered throughout this broad <b>geographic</b> <b>range.</b> Analysis of DNA barcodes indicated a pattern of genetic isolation by distance, suggesting the presence of a single species undergoing allopatric differentiation.|$|E

40|$|The <b>geographic</b> <b>ranges</b> of the 34 {{native species}} of {{freshwater}} crayfish known from Tasmania are mapped and described from extensive museum collections. Extents of occurrence range from over 30, 000 to about 5 km E- 2 and {{species in the}} open water genus Astacopsis have significantly greater ranges than the burrowing species {{in one of two}} undescribed genera within Parastacoides. Species living in Type 1 burrows associated with open water have significantly larger ranges than those found in Type 2, water table, burrows. Many species show mosaic istributions with either parapatric boundaries, or narrow zones of geographic overlap, or sympatric contact zones. In most cases, closely related species are also geographically close; exceptions to this trend may represent older clades, some members of which have suffered range contractions.

5|$|The koala's <b>geographic</b> <b>range</b> covers roughly , and 30 ecoregions. It extends {{throughout}} {{eastern and}} southeastern Australia, encompassing northeastern, central and southeastern Queensland, eastern New South Wales, Victoria, and southeastern South Australia. The koala was introduced near Adelaide and on several islands, including Kangaroo Island and French Island. The population on Magnetic Island represents the northern limit of its range. Fossil {{evidence shows that}} the koala's range stretched as far west as southwestern Western Australia during the late Pleistocene. They were likely driven to extinction in these areas by environmental changes and hunting by indigenous Australians.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{antelope}} prefers {{areas with}} fresh and dense growth of shrubs and other plants. It inhabits the warm, moist lowland forests prevalent in western African {{countries such as}} Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Its <b>geographic</b> <b>range</b> extends eastward from the Kounounkan Massif in southwestern Guinea through Sierra Leone, Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire to the Volta River in Ghana. The royal antelope may {{also be found in}} the region north to the forested areas of western Africa, which is marked by the interface of forest and savannah habitats.|$|E
5|$|The species' genetic {{diversity}} {{is similar to}} that of other pocket gophers occupying a larger <b>geographic</b> <b>range</b> and diversity of habitat. Compared to Townsend's pocket gopher, which is distributed across a much larger area, but less diverse habitat, it is more genetically heterogeneous. Although there is considerable differentiation between separate populations of camas pocket gophers, their genetic variability does not affect the mammal's appearance. Study of the effects of genetic change over time revealed a pattern affected by a cataclysmic event across the species' entire geographic area about 13,000 years ago. Such an event would cause a population bottleneck, leading to scattered, isolated populations.|$|E
40|$|Species {{richness}} {{patterns are}} remarkably similar across many marine taxa, yet explanations of how such patterns are generated and maintained are conflicting. I use published occurrence data to identify previously masked latitudinal and longitudinal diversity gradients for all genera of benthic marine macroalgae and for {{species in the}} Order Bryopsidales. I also quantify the size, location, and overlap of macroalgal <b>geographic</b> <b>ranges</b> {{to determine how the}} observed richness patterns are generated. Algal genera exhibit an inverse latitudinal gradient, with biodiversity hotspots in temperate regions, while bryopsidalean species reach peak diversity in the tropics. The <b>geographic</b> distribution of <b>range</b> locations results in distinct clusters of range mid-points. In particular, widespread taxa are centered within tight latitudinal and longitudinal bands {{in the middle of the}} Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Oceans while small-ranged taxa are clustered in peripheral locations, suggesting that variation in speciation and extinction are important drivers of algal diversity patterns. Hypotheses about factors that regulate diversity contain underlying assumptions about the size and location of <b>geographic</b> <b>ranges,</b> in addition to predictions as to why species numbers will differ among regions. Yet these assumptions are rarely considered in assessing the validity of the prevailing hypotheses. I assess a suite of hypotheses, suggested to explain patterns of marine diversity, by comparing algal-richness patterns in combination with the size and location of algal <b>geographic</b> <b>ranges,</b> to the richness and range locations predicted by these hypotheses. In particular, the results implicate habitat areas and ocean currents as the most plausible drivers of observed diversity patterns...|$|R
