2500|$|In the United States and Canada {{one must}} first {{complete}} a Bachelor's degree. Students may typically decide any major subject of their choice, however they must enroll in specific courses, usually outlined in a pre-medical program. One must then apply to and attend 4 years {{of medical school}} in order to earn his MD or DO and to complete his medical education. Psychiatrists must then pass three successive rigorous national board exams (United States Medical Licensing Exams [...] "USMLE", Steps 1, 2, and 3), which draws questions from all fields of medicine and surgery, before gaining an unrestricted license to practice medicine. Following this, the individual must complete a four-year residency in Psychiatry as a psychiatric resident and sit for annual national in-service exams. Psychiatry residents are required to complete at least four post-graduate months of internal medicine (pediatrics may be substituted for {{some or all of}} the internal medicine months for those planning to specialize in child and adolescent psychiatry) and two months of neurology, usually during the first year, but some programs require more. Occasionally, some prospective psychiatry residents will choose to do a transitional year internship in medicine or general surgery, in which case they may complete the two months of neurology later in their residency. After completing their training, psychiatrists take written and then oral specialty board examinations. [...] The total amount of time required to qualify in the field of psychiatry in the United States is typically 4 to 5 years after obtaining the MD or DO (or in total 8 to 9 years minimum). Many psychiatrists pursue an additional 1–2 years in subspecialty fellowships on top of this such as child psychiatry, <b>geriatric</b> <b>psychiatry,</b> and psychosomatic medicine.|$|E

40|$|There is no abrupt {{change in}} physiology, {{pathology}} or pharmacology occurring at {{or around the}} age of 65 years. There is some evidence {{of a change in}} the effect of illness, and of the prevalence of disability with advancing age. However, these changes are individual and gradual, and more associated with passing 75 - 80 years rather than 65. The main change occurring in the seventh decade arises from retirement from paid employment, and is therefore financial. Hence, in contrast to personal financial support, Health and Social Services departments would be ill advised to use the age of 65 as a threshold. Age-related admission policies may perpetuate ageism, and needs-related policies may therefore be preferable.

40|$|The {{computerized}} records {{held by the}} Joint Committee on Postgraduate Training for General Practice {{have been}} reviewed to determine the post-registration experience offered by doctors who were issued with a joint committee certificate during the years 1985 - 90, inclusive. The percentage of certificates issued {{on the basis of}} experience prescribed in the vocational training regulations rose from 74. 4 % in 1985 to 89. 7 % in 1990. Since 1985 obstetrics/gynaecology has been the specialty in which the greatest number of successful applicants have offered experience, increasing from 86. 4 % in 1985 to 93. 8 % in 1990. The next most popular specialty was accident and emergency/general surgery (offered by 65. 5 % of successful applicants in 1985 and 73. 6 % in 1990) followed by paediatrics (56. 7 % in 1985 and 62. 2 % in 1990). The percentage of certificates issued on the basis of experience in geriatric medicine rose slowly from 35. 6 % in 1985 to 41. 7 % in 1990, for psychiatry the figures were similar (36. 4 % in 1985 and 40. 7 % in 1990), and for general medicine there was a slight decrease (46. 2 % in 1985 and 44. 7 % in 1990). There is a need for more doctors to acquire experience in general medicine, <b>geriatric</b> medicine and <b>psychiatry.</b> Since 1985, the trend has been for applicants to offer a more broadly based range of experience. In 1985, 48. 5 % of successful applicants offered experience in four hospital specialties and this rose to 63. 6 % in 1990. Although the vocational training regulations offer a degree of flexibility {{only a small number of}} successful applicants have taken advantage of this. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

Purposes: To highlight the phenomenon of long-stay in an acute psychiatric ward and to relate it to demographic, clinical and organizational variables. Methods: The survey was conducted in the 15 -bed public psychiatric ward of Modena (Italy). All admissions were retrospectively collected from the database of the Department from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2011 (3981 hospitalizations with an average stay of 12. 49 days). Demographic data, clinical variables, inpatient care problems, discharge programs were statistically related to the duration of admissions (survival analysis: log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier curves). The 3981 hospitalizations were divided into two groups according to the 90 ° percentile of duration: < 27 days (n= 3575) and ≥ 27 days (n= 406) and the variables of the two groups were compared (multiple logistic regression). Secondary analysis was conducted on the subgroup of the longest hospitalizations further divided into two groups according to the 90 ° (from 27 days to < 36 days) and 95 ° percentile (≥ 36 days), in order to find out variables related (survival analysis: log-rank test; multiple logistic regression test).
