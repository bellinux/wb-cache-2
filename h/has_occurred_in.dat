5|$|Amanita muscaria {{poisoning}} <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> {{young children}} and in people who ingested the mushrooms for a hallucinogenic experience. Occasionally it has been ingested in error, because immature button forms resemble puffballs. The white spots sometimes wash away during heavy rain and the mushrooms then {{may appear to be}} the edible A.caesarea.|$|E
5|$|Hyperoxic myopia <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> {{closed circuit}} oxygen rebreather divers with {{prolonged}} exposures. It also occurs frequently in those undergoing repeated hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This {{is due to}} an increase in the refractive power of the lens, since axial length and keratometry readings do not reveal a corneal or length basis for a myopic shift. It is usually reversible with time.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{construction}} can {{adversely affect}} land stability. Subsidence <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> the Wairakei field in New Zealand. In Staufen im Breisgau, Germany, tectonic uplift occurred instead, {{due to a}} previously isolated anhydrite layer coming in contact with water and turning into gypsum, doubling its volume.|$|E

5|$|Ragnarök is briefly {{referenced}} in stanza 40 of {{the poem}} Helgakviða Hundingsbana II. Here, the valkyrie Sigrún's unnamed maid is passing the deceased hero Helgi Hundingsbane's burial mound. Helgi is there with a retinue of men, surprising the maid. The maid asks if she is witnessing a delusion since she sees dead men riding, or if Ragnarök <b>has</b> <b>occurred.</b> <b>In</b> stanza 41, Helgi responds that it is neither.|$|E
5|$|The {{shoreline}} of Harveys Lake {{is entirely}} {{surrounded by a}} paved road, which is atypical for a lake shoreline. Homes and cottages are situated on the road opposite the lake, and significant development <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> {{the vicinity of the}} lake. A ditch and outlet drainage structure made of concrete at Wardens Place drains into the lake; its purpose is to control small-scale local road flooding.|$|E
5|$|All line {{markings}} on the pitch {{form part of}} the area which they define. For example, a ball on the side line {{is still in the}} field of play; a ball on the line of the penalty circle is in the penalty circle; a foul committed over the 23-metre (25-yard) line <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> the 23-metre area. A ball must completely cross a boundary line to be out of play, and a ball must wholly cross the goal line before a goal is scored.|$|E
50|$|The probabilities that hypercalcemia would <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> {{the first}} place by other {{candidate}} conditions can be calculated in a similar manner. However, for simplicity, let’s say that the probability {{that any of these}} would <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> {{the first place}} is calculated at 0.0005 in this example.|$|R
25|$|Using {{the same}} probabilities that the hypercalcemia would <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> {{the first place}} by the other canditate conditions, the {{probability}} that hypercalcemia would <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> the first place is 0.00335, and {{given the fact that}} hypercalcemia <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> gives adjusted probabilities of 37.3%, 6.0%, 14.9% and 41.8%, respectively, for primary hyperparathyroidism, cancer, other conditions and no disease.|$|R

5|$|David Brooks {{argued that}} a more {{fundamental}} shift from a materialist to a post-materialist mindset <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> recent generations. While for generations born early in the century increased income {{was the same as}} improvements in lifestyle this is no longer true for people born into an affluent, information driven world. Younger generations live much more intellectually diverse lives and cites much user generated content as being mostly produced outside of the monetary economy. He affirms Cowen's acknowledgment that this has brought large increases in human happiness with correspondingly little economic activity.|$|E
5|$|From {{the middle}} of the 19th century until {{the early part of the}} 1970s, coal was mined in the eastern portion of the Catawissa Creek watershed. The coal was {{primarily}} mined in the Jeansville Coal Basin and the Green Mountain Coal Basin. The Catawissa Water Company once used water from Catawissa Creek. Five drainage tunnels were built in the watershed in the 1930s, and they still discharge acid mine drainage in the 21st century. Strip mining <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> parts of the watershed, mainly the Catawissa Creek headwaters and the Little Tomhicken Creek sub-watershed.|$|E
5|$|Hailstorms have {{a history}} of {{significant}} damage in Australia. Since records on insured losses began in 1967, four hailstormsSydney in 1986, 1990 and 1999, as well as Brisbane in 1985have featured on the top ten list of most insured damages caused by a single Australian natural disaster. Hailstorms caused more than 30% of all insured damages inflicted as a result of natural disasters in Australia during this period, and around three quarters of all hailstorm damage <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> New South Wales.|$|E

Since records on insured losses by the Insurance Disaster Response Organisation began in 1967 three other hailstorms — Sydney in 1986 and 1990, as well as Brisbane in 1985 — feature on the top-ten list of most insured damages caused by a single natural disaster, in addition to the 1999 storm. Hailstorms have caused more than 30% of all insured damages inflicted as a result of natural disasters in Australia during this period, and around three quarters of all hailstorm damage <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|In Europe and the Americas, a {{relatively}} small number of DPB cases have been reported in Asian immigrants and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry. Misdiagnosis <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> the West owing to less recognition of the disease than in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, the small number of them thought to be affected by DPB suggests non-genetic factors may play some role in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also be partly associated with misdiagnosis.|$|E
5|$|In the Aleutian Islands, {{a massive}} and {{unexpected}} disappearance of sea otters <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> recent decades. In the 1980s, {{the area was}} home to an estimated 55,000 to 100,000 sea otters, but the population fell to around 6,000 animals by 2000. The most widely accepted, but still controversial, hypothesis is that killer whales have been eating the otters. The pattern of disappearances {{is consistent with a}} rise in predation, but there has been no direct evidence of orcas preying on sea otters to any significant extent.|$|E

5|$|Introduction of {{non-native}} species <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> many habitats. One of {{the best}} studied examples is the introduction of Nile perch into Lake Victoria in the 1960s. Nile perch gradually exterminated the lake's 500 endemic cichlid species. Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes, but others are probably extinct. Carp, snakeheads, tilapia, European perch, brown trout, rainbow trout, and sea lampreys are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments.|$|E
5|$|Migration from Cyprus to the UK <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> {{part due}} to the colonial links between the {{countries}} and the internal conflict that followed Cyprus' independence from the British Empire in 1960. Migration peaked at the time of independence but has continued on a smaller scale. The number of Cypriot-born people in the UK fell between the 1991 and 2001 censuses, but the community, including people of Cypriot ancestry, remains sizeable, and the Cypriot-born population grew slightly between the 2001 and 2011 censuses.|$|E
5|$|Plant recolonization and {{succession}} <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> Glacier Bay as {{a result}} of the retreat of the glacier bay in the last about 300 years. The succession, which occurred in the new wilderness of Glacier Bay was stated to be a raw landscape. A simile given is that “It was like seeing an owl with no feathers”. A vegetative wilderness has been created, which has resulted in the coastal forest. 333 Vascular plant species of individual taxa have been recorded in the Glacier Bay. Dense thickets of Sitka alder and devil's club abound along the shoreline.|$|E
