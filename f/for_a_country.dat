5|$|Cagney's last {{movie in}} 1935 was Ceiling Zero, his third film with Pat O'Brien. O'Brien {{received}} top billing, {{which was a}} clear breach of Cagney's contract. This, combined {{with the fact that}} Cagney had made five movies in 1934, again against his contract terms, caused him to bring legal proceedings against Warner Bros. for breach of contract. The dispute dragged on for several months. Cagney received calls from David Selznick and Sam Goldwyn, but neither felt in a position to offer him work while the dispute went on. Meanwhile, while being represented by his brother William in court, Cagney went back to New York to search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> property where he could indulge his passion for farming.|$|E

5|$|The geology of Scotland {{is unusually}} varied <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> of its size, {{with a large}} number of differing {{geological}} features. There are three main geographical sub-divisions: the Highlands and Islands is a diverse area which lies to the north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault; the Central Lowlands is a rift valley mainly comprising Paleozoic formations; and the Southern Uplands, which lie south of the Southern Uplands Fault, are largely composed of Silurian deposits.|$|E
5|$|The {{judicial}} establishment, in {{the broadest}} sense, is composed of qadis, who give binding judgements in specific court cases, and muftis {{and other members of}} the ulema, who issue generalized but highly influential legal opinions (fatwas). The Grand Mufti is the most senior member of the judicial establishment as well as being the highest religious authority in the country; his opinions are highly influential among the Saudi judiciary. The judiciary proper (that is, the body of qadis) is composed of about 700 judges, a relatively small number (according to critics) <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> of over 23 million.|$|E

40|$|To explain {{cross-country}} income differences, {{research has}} recently {{focused on the}} so-called deep determinants of economic development, notably institutions and geography.

More specifically, we analyze the importance of the geography of institutions.

This finding is robust to various alternative specifications of relative geography, sample size and the inclusion of additional controls...|$|R
