40|$|This paper {{presents}} a very efficient method for vectorizing and labeling very large raster <b>hypsographic</b> <b>map</b> images. By extending the contour tree (Freeman and Morse, 1967) to a contour graph, open contour lines and carrying contour lines can be handled. The ambiguities of the topological relationships among contour lines are resolved using map structure information, i. e., elevation tags and index contour lines. Contour graph is constructed and processed efficiently by introducing index contour graph. By using a sequential extraction algorithm (Agrawala and Kulkarni, 1977) for vectorization, attributes for contour lines, such as line width, and elevation tag(s), are extracted efficiently. Although {{it was developed}} primarily for USGS 1 : 24, 000 hypsographic maps {{as part of the}} GISOM project at The Ohio State University Center for Mapping, the method also is applicable to other scale USGS hypsographic maps. We have applied the algorithm successfully to raster images with pixel [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The Livonian Public Welfare and EconomicSociety and Studies in the Estonian Reliefin the 19 th CenturyIt is {{remarkable}} {{that the history}} of Estonian cartography {{is at the same time}} the history of Estonian agriculture, not that of military sciences with which the development of cartography is usually connected in many countries of the world. Military science did have a roll in mapping the western governorates of Russia, i. e., Estonia, Livonia and Courland, but the Estonian, Livonian and Curonian agricultural societies were more important in the early 19 th century and its secondhalf. The first detailed <b>hypsographic</b> <b>map</b> in Estonia was completedupon the initiative of the Estonian Agricultural Society in the years 1868 â€“ 1869 with the purpose of determining the paludified areas in the governorate of Estonia. The Livonian Public Welfare and Economic Society did not want to fall behind its sister organisation. Carl Johann von Seidlitz, owner of the Meeri estate, physician and naturalist, was responsible for the general levelling of Livonia from the part of the Society. He headed the respective commission which determined the main principles of levelling by early 1874 and tasked that the measurements to be taken be more precise than in Estonia. They did achieve that purpose, although the work was prolonged andfinancially exhausting for the Society...|$|E
40|$|Land {{consolidation}} {{projects in}} the Slovak Republic have reached the state where there is sufficient sample of valuable information (planimetric and <b>hypsographic</b> measurements, updated <b>maps</b> of estimated pedologic-ecological units, concepts of local territorial system of ecological stability, plans for the general principles of functional organization of the territory, etc.) for society. The contribution points out {{need to create a}} uniform public or archiving information system (database), which is incurred in landscape planning activities in model areas. By now several information systems created in Slovakia are not connected one to another and thus cannot be further use. The article pointed out the procedures leading to the processing of a unified information system that collects and archives the outputs of landscaping activities in the area. This is dedicated to the administrators, system users and use cases of the unified system. Therefore we emphasized the importance of system deployment defined for different users. Next step is to describe the input to the elaboration of a comprehensive database. The system is demonstrated on the basis of data obtained from land consolidation projects. Subsequently, we present all computed graphical information by publishing on the local console of OpenGeoSuite environment...|$|R
