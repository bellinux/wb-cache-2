5|$|Xgrid's {{original}} concept can {{be traced}} back to Zilla.app, found in the OPENSTEP operating system, created by NeXT in the late 1980s. Zilla was the first distributed computing program released on an end-user operating system and which used the idle screen-saver motif, a design feature since found in widely used projects such as Seti@Home and Distributed.net. Zilla won the national Computerworld Smithsonian Award (Science Category) in 1991 for ease of use and <b>good</b> <b>design.</b> Apple acquired Zilla, along with the rest of NeXT, in 1997 and later used Zilla as inspiration for Xgrid. The first beta version of Xgrid was released in January 2004.|$|E
5|$|Operational design {{management}} involves {{the management of}} individual design projects and design teams. Its goal is to achieve the objectives set by strategic {{design management}}. Success of <b>good</b> <b>design</b> management can be measured by {{evaluating the quality of}} operational design management outcomes. It includes the selection and management of design suppliers and encompasses the documentation, supervision, and evaluation of design processes and results. It deals with personal leadership, emotional intelligence, and the cooperation with and management of internal communications. Regular management functions, tools, and concepts can often be applied to the management of design on the operational level. It is implemented to achieve specific design objectives and manage the judgment of design proposals. It can help to build brand equity through the consistent creation and implementation of high-quality design solutions that best fit the brand identity and desired consumer experience, in the most efficient way. Depending on the type of company and industry, the following job titles are associated with this role: operational design manager, senior designer, team leader, visual communication manager, corporate design coordinator, and others.|$|E

25|$|The ancient Romans also {{employed}} regular orthogonal {{structures on}} which they molded their colonies. They probably were inspired by Greek and Hellenic examples, {{as well as by}} regularly planned cities that were built by the Etruscans in Italy. (See Marzabotto.) The Roman engineer Vitruvius established principles of <b>good</b> <b>design</b> whose influence is still felt today.|$|E
25|$|Functions of two {{variables}} {{were provided by}} three-dimensional cams. In one <b>good</b> <b>design,</b> one of the variables rotated the cam. A hemispherical follower moved its carrier on a pivot axis parallel {{to that of the}} cam's rotating axis. Pivoting motion was the output. The second variable moved the follower along the axis of the cam. One practical application was ballistics in gunnery.|$|E
25|$|Essential {{elements}} of the genre include storytelling, exploration, and puzzle solving. Adventure games {{have been described as}} puzzles embedded in a narrative framework, where games involve narrative content that a player unlocks piece by piece over time. While the puzzles that players encounter through the story can be arbitrary, those that do not pull the player out of the narrative are considered examples of <b>good</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art {{opened on}} May 10, 1877. Its {{permanent}} collection began with {{objects from the}} Exhibition and gifts from the public impressed with the Exhibition's ideals of <b>good</b> <b>design</b> and craftsmanship. European and Japanese fine and decorative art objects and books for the Museum's library {{were among the first}} donations. The location outside of Center City, however, was fairly distant from many of the city's inhabitants. Admission was charged until 1881, then was dropped until 1962.|$|E
25|$|This {{city was}} the first planned city in Ireland: it was begun in 1613, with the walls being {{completed}} in 1619, {{at a cost of}} £10,757. The central diamond within a walled city with four gates was thought to be a <b>good</b> <b>design</b> for defence. The grid pattern chosen was subsequently much copied in the colonies of British North America. The charter initially defined the city as extending three Irish miles (about 6.1km) from the centre.|$|E
25|$|Idea Collection – In these problems, someone solicits {{ideas for}} projects, designs or {{solutions}} from the crowd. For example, ideas on solving a data science problem (as in Kaggle) or getting a <b>good</b> <b>design</b> for a T-shirt (as in Threadless) or in getting answers to simple problems that only humans can do well (as in Amazon’s Mechanical Turk).

25|$|In practice, {{this means}} that the Selenium 2.0 API has {{significantly}} fewer calls than does the Selenium 1.0 API. Where Selenium 1.0 attempted to provide a rich interface for many different browser operations, Selenium 2.0 aims to provide a basic set of building blocks from which developers can create their own Domain Specific Language. One such DSL already exists: the Watir project in the Ruby language has a rich history of <b>good</b> <b>design.</b> Watir-webdriver implements the Watir API as a wrapper for Selenium-Webdriver in Ruby. Watir-webdriver is created entirely automatically, based on the WebDriver specification and the HTML specification.|$|E
25|$|Between 1932 and 1934 Cliff was the art {{director}} {{for a major}} project involving nearly 30 artists of the day (prompted by the Prince of Wales) to promote <b>good</b> <b>design</b> on tableware. The 'Artists in Industry' earthenware examples were produced under her direction, and the artists included such notable names as Duncan Grant, Paul Nash, Barbara Hepworth, Vanessa Bell, and Dame Laura Knight. The project 'Modern Art for the Table' was launched at Harrods London in October 1934 but received a mixed response from {{both the public and}} the press, though at the same time Cliff's own patterns and shapes were selling in large quantities around the world.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007, the Cervo {{received}} the <b>Good</b> <b>Design</b> Award, and the SR version was introduced. This had a new, 64hp direct injection turbo engine and a seven-step CVT transmission, {{the first time}} for such a combination to be available. With front-wheel drive, this car achieved a remarkable 23.0km/l (54 mpg) on the test cycle. The Cervo also received some minor updates across the line, with new liquid seal engine mounts and suspension changes. In May 2008 the range received more minor updates, with new colors being added and a new limited edition model, the G Limited II, which featured alcantara interior and a sporty exterior. Other models received new aero parts and other equipment, gas discharge headlights were now available on the SR.|$|E

25|$|Product {{and process}} design can be largely {{improved}} using modern modeling, simulation and optimization techniques. The key question in optimal design {{is the measure}} of what is good or desirable about a design. Before looking for optimal designs {{it is important to}} identify characteristics which contribute the most to the overall value of the design. A <b>good</b> <b>design</b> typically involves multiple criteria/objectives such as capital cost/investment, operating cost, profit, quality and/or recovery of the product, efficiency, process safety, operation time etc. Therefore, in practical applications, the performance of process and product design is often measured with respect to multiple objectives. These objectives typically are conflicting, i.e. achieving the optimal value for one objective requires some compromise on one or more of other objectives.|$|E
25|$|In wet {{and cold}} climates, {{reinforced}} concrete for roads, bridges, parking structures and other structures {{that may be}} exposed to deicing salt may benefit from use of corrosion-resistant reinforcement such as uncoated, low carbon/chromium (micro composite), epoxy-coated, hot dip galvanised or stainless steel rebar. <b>Good</b> <b>design</b> and a well-chosen concrete mix will provide additional protection for many applications. Uncoated, low carbon/chromium rebar looks similar to standard carbon steel rebar due to its lack of a coating; its highly corrosion-resistant features are inherent in the steel microstructure. It can be identified by the unique ASTM specified mill marking on its smooth, dark charcoal finish. Epoxy coated rebar can easily be identified by the light green colour of its epoxy coating. Hot dip galvanized rebar may be bright or dull grey depending on length of exposure, and stainless rebar exhibits a typical white metallic sheen that is readily distinguishable from carbon steel reinforcing bar. Reference ASTM standard specifications A1035/A1035M Standard Specification for Deformed and Plain Low-carbon, Chromium, Steel Bars for Concrete Reinforcement, A767 Standard Specification for Hot Dip Galvanised Reinforcing Bars, A775 Standard Specification for Epoxy Coated Steel Reinforcing Bars and A955 Standard Specification for Deformed and Plain Stainless Bars for Concrete Reinforcement.|$|E
