25|$|In March 1936 Rheinmetall made a {{proposal}} for a super-heavy howitzer to attack the Maginot Line. Their initial concept was for a weapon that would be transported by several tracked vehicles and assembled on site, but the lengthy preparation time drove them to change it to a self-propelled weapon in January 1937. Extensive driving trials took place in 1938 and 1939 using the first Neubaufahrzeug tank prototype and a scale model to investigate the extremely high <b>ground</b> <b>pressure</b> and steering of such an enormous vehicle. Firing trials took place in June 1939. The full-scale driving trials were held at Unterlüss in May 1940. General Karl Becker of the Artillery was involved in the development, from whom the huge weapon gained its nickname.|$|E
25|$|Other surface {{features}} {{may include}} disturbed <b>ground,</b> <b>pressure</b> ridges, faults, water movement (including {{changes to the}} water table level), rockfalls, and ground slump. Most of the gas in the cavity is composed of steam; its volume decreases dramatically as the temperature falls and the steam condenses. There are however other gases, mostly carbon dioxide and hydrogen, which do not condense and remain gaseous. The carbon dioxide is produced by thermal decomposition of carbonates, hydrogen is created by reaction of iron and other metals from the nuclear device and surrounding equipment. The amount of carbonates and water in the soil and the available iron {{have to be considered}} in evaluating the test site containment; water-saturated clay soils may cause structural collapse and venting. Hard basement rock may reflect shock waves of the explosion, also possibly causing structural weakening and venting. The noncondensible gases may stay absorbed in the pores in the soil. Large amount of such gases can however maintain enough pressure to drive the fission products to the ground.|$|E

25|$|The engine {{compartment}} {{is located in}} the rear of the vehicle and consists of: a 2V-06-02 water-cooled diesel engine developing 450hp, a main clutch, a gearbox, a final drives, and brakes. The suspension of the vehicle consists of five rubber-tyred road wheels on each side, a drive sprocket at the rear, an idler at the front, and four track-return rollers. The BMD-3 is fitted with a new hydromechanical transmission with hydrostatic steering mechanism. This adjustable suspension gives a ground clearance between 130 and 530mm with 450mm being the default. This hydropneumatic suspension allows the BMD-3 to decrease its height to be able to board transport aircraft like the Il-76M. The ground clearance is adjusted by the driver and it takes 10 seconds to lower or raise the suspension. The maximum road speed is 70km/h and the maximum off-road speed is 45km/h. The vehicle can achieve an operational range of up to 500km on paved roads and can climb up to 60% gradient and move on a 30% side slope. The <b>ground</b> <b>pressure</b> exerted by the BMD-3 is 0.48 kg/cm2 with standard tracks and 0.32kg/cm2 with broader tracks.|$|E
500|$|Like the Tiger I, each {{tank was}} issued with {{two sets of}} tracks: a normal [...] "battle track" [...] and a {{narrower}} [...] "transport" [...] version used during rail movement. The transport tracks reduced the overall width of the load and {{could be used to}} drive the tank short distances on firm ground. The crew were expected to change to normal battle tracks as soon as the tank was unloaded. <b>Ground</b> <b>pressure</b> was 0.76kg/cm2 (10.8 psi).|$|E
500|$|After only 10 {{units were}} delivered, the Infantry Branch decided {{to switch to}} a twin turret {{configuration}} in the M2E2, with a [...]30-caliber (7.62mm) machine gun in a second turret. These early twin-turret tanks were given the nickname [...] "Mae West" [...] by the troops, after the popular busty movie star. The twin-turret layout was inefficient, but was a common feature of 1930s light tanks derived from the Vickers, such as the Soviet T-26 and Polish 7TP. Further refinements to the M2A2 produced the A3 model, which incorporated a modified suspension system that reduced the tank's <b>ground</b> <b>pressure.</b> The weight increased to 10 tons.|$|E
40|$|This U. S. Bureau of Mines report {{describes}} {{the results from}} an in-mine investigation of an alternative longwall gate road design. The coal mine operator modified the pillar layout (reversed {{the location of the}} big and small pillars) in a portion of a three-entry longwall gate road area. The modified pillar layout was an attempt to reduce stress and, subsequently, stress-related ground control problems (cutter roof and dynamic floor heave events) in the tailgate region during "second-panel" mining. The results from borehole pressure cells installed in the modified gate road area showed that the <b>ground</b> <b>pressures</b> in the panel edge and adjacent small pillar were significantly reduced during second-panel mining compared with <b>ground</b> <b>pressures</b> experienced in the typical pillar layout gate road areas.

The weight of the vehicle was now , which required a corresponding modification of track width from [...] to reduce <b>ground</b> <b>pressure.</b> The wider tracks also facilitated the fitting of track shoe [...] "ice sprags", and the rear idler wheel and front sprocket were modified. The designation Ausf.F was changed in the meantime to Ausf.F1, after the distinct new model, the Ausf.F2, appeared. A total of 471 Ausf.F (later temporarily called F1) tanks were produced from April 1941 to March 1942.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tricycle}} {{landing gear}} system's initial main gear design, with huge single wheels found to cause significant <b>ground</b> <b>pressure</b> problems, limited the B-36 to operating from just three air bases in the United States: Carswell Field (former Carswell AFB, now NAS JRB Fort Worth/Carswell Field), adjacent to the Consolidated factory in Fort Worth, Texas; Eglin Field (now Eglin AFB), Florida; and Fairfield-Suisun Field (now Travis AFB) in California).|$|E

2500|$|Ethiopia ordered twenty AH-IV-Hb tankettes on 24 June 1948. In form these {{reverted to}} the driver's machine gun and single machine {{gun in the}} turret, but were of welded {{construction}} rather than riveted. They used a , air-cooled Tatra 114 diesel engine that produced [...] at 2200rpm.

2500|$|To {{fit inside}} the {{transport}} aircraft of the time, the vehicle's height {{had to be}} less than , its width had {{to be less than}} [...] To meet the <b>ground</b> <b>pressure</b> requirement of five psi, the tracks had to be [...] wide. The width also dictated the engine used - it had to fit next to a driver in full winter clothing. The engine compartment could only be [...] wide. No tank engines in production or development at the time were suitable, so the Jaguar 4.2-litre petrol engine was used. This was modified to use military-grade fuel, with a compression ratio lowered from 9:1 to 7.75:1 and a single Solex Marcus carburettor, resulting in a power output reduction from 265 bhp to 195 bhp.|$|E
50|$|The {{other major}} Lend-Lease {{recipient}} of the M3, the Soviet Union, was even less happy with the tank, considering it undergunned, underarmored, likely to catch fire, and too sensitive to fuel quality. The narrow tracks were highly unsuited to operation in winter conditions, as they resulted in high <b>ground</b> <b>pressures</b> that sunk the tank. However, the Stuart was superior to early-war Soviet light tanks such as the T-60, which were often underpowered and possessed even lighter armament than the Stuart. In 1943, the Red Army tried out the M5 and decided that the upgraded design wasn't {{much better than the}} M3. Being less desperate than in 1941, the Soviets turned down an American offer to supply the M5. M3s continued in Red Army service at least until 1944.|$|R
30|$|In {{consideration}} of lifting {{conditions such as}} the working radius and weight of lifting objects, 18 candidate cranes are selected in total. <b>Ground</b> contact <b>pressure</b> upon operation of each candidate crane is calculated, and allowable soil bearing force is set as 20 tf/m 2 to design plates for reinforcement of soil bearing force.|$|R
50|$|The {{disadvantages}} of tracks are lower top speed, much greater mechanical complexity, shorter {{life and the}} damage that their all-steel versions cause to the surface on which they pass. They are assumed to severely damage hard terrain such as asphalt pavement, but actually have significantly lower <b>ground</b> <b>pressures</b> than equivalent or lighter wheeled vehicles. However, they often cause damage to less firm terrain such as lawns, gravel roads, and farm fields, as the sharp edges of the track easily rout the turf. Accordingly, vehicle laws and local ordinances often require rubberised tracks or track pads. A compromise between all-steel and all-rubber tracks exists: attaching rubber pads to individual track links ensures that continuous track vehicles can travel more smoothly, quickly, and quietly on paved surfaces. While these pads slightly reduce a vehicle's cross-country traction, in theory they prevent damage to any pavement.|$|R
2500|$|Iran was {{the first}} {{customer}} for the AH-IV and ordered fifty plus a prototype in 1935 for delivery the following year. Deliveries began in August 1936 with the last batch arriving in Iran in May 1937, although the armament was shipped separately and wasn't installed until November 1937. The Iranians were well pleased with their vehicles and planned to order between 100 and 300 additional AH-IVs, but the outbreak of World War II prevented any follow-through. Their tankettes were {{the smallest of the}} series at only [...] and differed only slightly in size from the Romanian R-1 tankettes that followed it on the production lines.

2500|$|The {{mechanical}} superstructure {{was taken}} from a T23. The original plan was to build five prototype vehicles, with a production total of 25. Its total weight when fully equipped would have reached 95 short tons (86 tonnes). To lower <b>ground</b> <b>pressure,</b> instead of two tracks, it used four tracks that projected forward of the hull, each 12.9inches (328mm) wide. The outer tracks could be detached within two hours for rail transport: [...] After removal, they could be fixed {{together to make a}} unit that could be towed behind the tank. Due to its extreme weight and low engine power, the T28 had extremely limited obstacle-crossing ability and could not cross any of the portable bridges available at the time, and so was considered impractical in the field and not suitable for production.|$|E
2500|$|The new {{howitzer}} was a road-mobile weapon {{mounted on}} a two-wheeled field type carriage of conventional, if massive, construction. It was a completely different weapon from the Gamma-Gerät. The barrel was shorter than Gamma's by four calibres length, and reverted to the conventional Krupp sliding-wedge breech. With thinner walls, the barrel was of generally lighter construction than Gamma's and fired lighter shells of around 830kg. Fully assembled it weighed 43 tons, much less than Gamma, {{and did not have}} to be emplaced in concrete. Special steel [...] "mats" [...] were developed, onto which the wheels were driven, with a steel aiming arc at the rear of the carriage that allowed limited traverse. This aiming arc was fitted with a massive [...] "spade" [...] that was buried in the ground and which helped anchor the weapon. To prevent the weapon bogging down in muddy roads the guns were equipped with Radgürteln, feet attached to the rim of the wheels to reduce <b>ground</b> <b>pressure.</b> Krupp and Daimler developed a tractor for the Bertha, though Podeus motorploughs were also used to tow the guns, which were broken down into five loads when on the road.|$|E

500|$|During the Easter Rising {{an attempt}} was made to blow up the pillar but the {{explosives}} failed to ignite due to dampness. It remained in the city as most of Ireland became the Irish Free State in 1922, and the Republic of Ireland in 1949.

Cooling air was designed to draw air in through the commander's and driver's hatches. This had the advantage of rapidly dispersing gun combustion gases when firing, but several disadvantages. The constant draft generated by the engine greatly affected the crew during cold weather, an engine fire would force the crew to evacuate and the engine noise and heat increased crew fatigue.

The suspension was a smaller version of that used in the Panzerkampfwagen 38(t). It consisted of four large road wheels per side, each pair mounted on a wheel carrier and sprung by leaf springs. There were two wheel carriers per side. The idler wheel was at the rear and one return roller was fitted. It had a <b>ground</b> <b>pressure</b> of only 0.5kg/cm2.

2500|$|The 60hp Schneider {{gasoline}} engine and its radiator {{are located in}} the front part of the tank, to the immediate left of the driver. The four cylinder, 135×170 9753 cc, engine is of a type specially constructed for the Schneider CA. It attains its maximum output of sixty horsepower at a thousand rpm. The three forward speeds gearbox, as well as the differentials, which can be engaged by brakes on the half shafts to steer the tank, are all located on the rear axle. They are linked to the engine in the front by a driveshaft and a primary clutch. A secondary clutch is coupled to each sprocket and can be decoupled for a tight turn. The main clutch and the main brakes can be engaged by pedals, the throttle by a handle. By means of a reverse device the three gears can also be applied to drive backwards. Steering was generally very tiring and there was a tendency to jump out of gear when the clutch was engaged too forcefully. The tank's official top speed is only 8.1km/h. Practical terrain speed was even lower at two to four km/h. The first gear at 1000 rpm equals a speed of 2km/h, the second of 3.95km/h, the third of 6.75km/h. At two kilometres per hour the vehicle can climb a slope of 55%. The capacity to overcome obstacles, limited to a parapet of about eighty centimetres, is improved by two short climbing tails, fitted to the left and right of the lower hull rear. The lower profile of the tails is curved, allowing the vehicle to gradually raise itself above a trench floor, until its centre of gravity shifts over the edge causing its hull to suddenly tumble forward. [...] The trench-crossing capacity is about 175 centimetres. The wading capacity is eighty centimetres. Two fuel gravity-feed reservoirs placed above the engine below the right front roof and nose plate, have a total capacity of 145 litres, and allow for a practical range of about fifty kilometres, though the official range is eighty kilometres. The suspension consists of seven double road wheels attached to two bogies, the one in front carrying three, the other four. The rear bogie is sprung by two vertical coil springs, the front one larger than the rear one. [...] The front bogies of the left and the right, each sprung by a vertical coil of narrow diameter, are connected to each other by means of a yoke-like transverse beam, itself attached to the hull bottom by two wide vertical coils springs, diminishing rolling and tilt when crossing rough terrain. Ground clearance is forty-one centimetres. There are five small return rollers. The six-spoked idler is attached to the front bogie and can thus move vertically to some degree. The sprocket, having twenty teeth, is however fixed in relation to the hull. It has a somewhat larger diameter than the idler, causing the upper track profile to slope slightly downwards to the front. The track consists of thirty-three flat links with a width of thirty-six centimetres. The <b>ground</b> <b>pressure</b> is about 0.75kg/cm².|$|E
