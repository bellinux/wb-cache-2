40|$|Preforms {{constructed}} from a plain-weave, glass fabric were compressed in-plane within a fixture that mimicked {{the constraints of}} a closed mold. Typically, a gap was left between {{the bottom of the}} preform and the floor of the fixture; upon Initial compression, the preform slid within the fixture, which allowed the friction between the preform and the <b>fixture</b> <b>wall</b> to be measured. The preform began to compress as it contacted the floor of the fixture. The deformation was proportional to the applied stress until a critical stress was reached. Above this stress, the preform sustained damage in the form if localized buckling and a corresponding decrease in mechanical integrity. The in-plane compressive behavior varied with system parameters, such as preform geometry, fabric orientation, and clamping stress and was shown to be strongly dependent on friction of the preform against the <b>fixture</b> <b>wall.</b> A model was developed to describe the contribution of preform friction with the <b>fixture</b> <b>wall</b> to the in-plane compressive behavior of constrained preforms...|$|E

40|$|Fixtures {{are used}} to locate and hold parts during {{automated}} inspection, machining, or assembly. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are tiny devices built in batch processes derived from integrated circuit fabrication. We describe a design for an array of MEMS microfixtures for parallel inspection, transport, and assembly of microfabricated parts. In a microfixture array, parts are brought near the fixture by random motion provided e. g. by vibratory agitation. The fixture clamps actively close when the parts enter the fixture. In large future fixture arrays, electrostatic or optical sensors integrated into the fixture cell can trigger this clamping function. Each cell operates autonomously and no global control is necessary. We fabricated a prototype cell consisting of two upfoldable <b>fixture</b> <b>walls</b> and a bimorph thermal actuator using a standard CMOS process.

40|$|The flies which enter {{dwellings}} in Iowa develop {{largely in}} the manure of farm animals and in refuse from the home. They are important from several standpoints. Some species are known to carry upon their bodies the germs of certain human diseases; furthermore, {{they are able to}} consume disease organisms with their food and subsequently to discharge these organisms in a living condition. Germ-laden flies may then carry the organisms to human food or place them upon the lips of sleeping children. A number of species are known to spread intestinal parasites of man; others carry important parasitic and disease-producing organisms of farm animals. Several species are pests of farm animals, which they annoy by biting or by crawling over their skin. Occasionally the larvae of certain flies enter wounds or the digestive and urinary tracts of man, producing a diseased condition known as myiasis. Aside from spreading human and animal diseases, flies are destructive pests in the home. Whenever abundant, they befoul windows and woodwork and sometimes permanently damage <b>fixtures,</b> <b>wall</b> paper, pictures and hangings. In addition, the larvae of a number of species live in various foodstuffs and so render them unfit for human consumption...|$|R

40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is the continual {{development}} of a <b>wall</b> <b>fixture</b> previously developed ina thesis as a concept together with specification on the final product. The specification from theprevious thesis describe that the <b>wall</b> <b>fixture</b> should meet all required standards for safety, butthe previous existing concept have not been fully developed according to this. The focus of this continuing work has been to see how demands on safety would affect thedesign of the <b>wall</b> <b>fixture.</b> The theoretical framework has therefore been on relevant safetystandards applicable on the Swedish market, and these have been a deciding factor duringdesign choices made during the continuing product development. The methodology has been an iterative work, wherein ideas for development have beendiscussed with Husmuttern, analysed for risks according to demands set by the safety standardsand finally put onto fabrication drawings enable fabrication of a prototype. The conclusion is that it¬¥s possible to minimize risks in the concept phase, but that therequirements on safety makes {{that some of the}} demands in the specification have to be omitted. Previous demands on a purely mechanical operation with counterweight is deemed as to riskyfor the users, and a different solution with an electric engine system is chosen instead. This inturn puts demand to follow additional standards regulating the implementation of electronicsand control systems. The risk analysis that have been made should be updated to include thiswhen prototype is built. In conjunction to this the order of assembly of a wall should be chosento eliminate ergonomic risks, and the foundation for the systematic health and environmentwork should be done, two aspects of the health and environment that can‚Äôt be fully evaluatedduring concept development.

Data were collected by means of measurement, questionaire and observation, then analyzed descrpitively and used Contingency Coefficient test to analyze the strength of associations between variables also calculate the Relative Risk value. The results showed that the intensity of general lighting ranged from 39 - 290 lux and local lighting ranged from 61. 5 - 187. 3 lux did not comply with the standard established by PMP no. 7 - 1964 (500 lux). Most of computer operators characteristics, age was 20 - 29 years (64. 70 %), length of employment was less than 3 years (70. 60 %) and duration of work was 4 - 8 hours (52. 90 %) and most of them did not complained glare (55. 90 %) and shadow (94. 10 %). The majority of computer operators complained ocular eyestrain (60. 00 %). There were moderate associations between glare (C = 0. 309) and eye strain as well as duration of work (C = 0. 326). There were significant Relative Risk value on glare, shadow and duration of work toward eyestrain.

Decorating materials, cleansing agents and even local regional pollutants outside the hotels could have a contribution and worsen indoor air quality. Toluene level was as high as 498 Œºg/m 3 in a hotel fitted with lots of plywood products. The highest concentrations of methylene chloride (34 Œºg/m 3) and total carbonyls (517 Œºg/m 3) were detected in a hotel where high VOCs cleansing agents were used in guest rooms. In another hotel located in an industrial centre, acetone concentration of 102 Œºg/m 3 was observed. The second highest total VOCs concentration (445 Œºg/m 3) was observed in a newly renovated hotel.
