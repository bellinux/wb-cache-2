40|$|Recent {{attempts}} {{to apply the}} results of martingale theory in probability theory have shown that {{it is first necessary}} to interpret this abstract mathematical theory in more conventional terms. One example of this is the need to obtain a representation of the <b>dual</b> predictable <b>projections</b> (compensators) used in martingale theory in terms of probability distributions. However, up to now a representation of this type has been derived only for one special case. In this paper, the author gives probabilistic representations of the <b>dual</b> predictable <b>projection</b> of integer-valued random measures that correspond to jumps in a semimartingale with respect to the sigma-algebras generated by this process. The results are of practical importance because such <b>dual</b> predictable <b>projections</b> are usually interpreted as random intensities or hazard rates related to jumps in trajectories: applications are found in such fields as mathematical demography and risk analysis...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{two-fold}} dimensional {{dependence of the}} electromagnetic duality groups. We introduce the <b>dual</b> <b>projection</b> operation that systematically discloses {{the presence of an}} internal space of potentials where the group operation is defined. A two-fold property of the kernel in the projection is shown to define the dimensional dependence of the duality groups. The <b>dual</b> <b>projection</b> is then generalized to reveal another hidden two-dimensional structure. The new unifying concept of the external duality space remove the dimensional dependence of the kernel, allowing the presence of both $Z_ 2 $ and SO(2) duality groups in all even dimensions. This result, ultimately unifies the notion of selfduality to all D= 2 k+ 2 dimensions. Finally, we show the presence of an unexpected duality between the internal and external spaces leading to a duality of the duality groups. Comment: RevTex, 6 pages, Accepted for publication Phys.

40|$|Axon {{guidance}} cues of the ephrin ligand {{family have}} been hypothesized {{to regulate the}} formation of thalamocortical connections, but in vivo evidence for such a role has not been examined directly. To test whether ephrin-mediated repulsive cues participate in sorting the projections originating from distinct thalamic nuclei, we analyzed the organization of somatosensory and anterior cingulate afferents postnatally in mice lacking ephrin-A 5 gene expression. Projections from ventrobasal and laterodorsal nuclei to their respective sensory and limbic cortical areas developed normally. However, a portion of limbic thalamic neurons from the laterodorsal nucleus also formed additional projections to somatosensory cortical territories, thus maintaining inappropriate <b>dual</b> <b>projections</b> to multiple cortical regions.
