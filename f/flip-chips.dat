Next-generation high-density packaging applications would necessitate a new base substrate material to achieve ultra-fine pitch solder-joint reliability and {{multiple layers of}} fine-line wiring at low cost. The NEMI 2000 roadmap defines the need for 4 - 8 layers of 5 - 10 m wiring for future system boards. The 2003 ITRS roadmap calls for organic substrates with less than 100 -m area-array pitch in the package or board by year 2010. Solder-joint reliability at such fine-pitch {{is a matter of}} concern for the industry. Use of underfills reduces thermal stresses but increases cost and, in addition, their dispensing becomes increasingly more complicated with the shorter gaps required for future interconnects. Therefore, there is a pronounced need to evaluate board materials with CTE close to that of Si for reliable flip-chip on board without underfill. Recently, a novel manufacturing process (using polymeric precursor) has been demonstrated to yield boards that have the advantages of organic boards in terms of large-area processability and machinability at potentially low-cost while retaining the high stiffness (~ 250 GPa) and Si-matched CTE (~ 2. 5 ppm/㩠of ceramics.

40|$|Abstract The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to study unique cases for computer-assisted finite element modeling (FEM) of thermal, mechanical and thermo-mechanical problems related to silicon and carbon. Computational modeling contributed to solve scientific problems either by validating the experimental results obtained earlier or by predicting {{the behavior of a}} particular system. In the model generation phase, emphasis is placed on simplification of a physical problem without loosing the validity or important details. As a consequence of reasonably reduced variables and also degrees of freedom of the elements in our models, the simulations could be performed using a commercial FEM software package, ANSYS®. To test the capabilities of the method (i) a steady-state finite element thermal analysis has been accomplished and verified by experiments for the case of laser-assisted heating of different materials.

40|$|The {{demands for}} higher clock speeds and larger current {{magnitude}} in high-performance flip-chip electronic packaging configurations of small footprint have inevitably raised the concern over rapid thermal transients and large thermal spatial gradients that could severely compromise package performance. Coupled electrical-thermal-mechanical multi-physics were explored {{to evaluate the}} concern and to establish the knowledge base necessary for improving flip-chip reliability. It was found that within the first few hundred nanoseconds upon power-on, there were fast attenuating, dispersive shock waves of extremely high frequency propagating in the package. The notions of high cycle fatigue, power density and joint time-frequency analysis were employed to characterize the waves and the various failure modes associated with the moving of these short-lived dynamical disturbances in bulk materials and along interfaces. A qualitative measure for failure was also developed which enables the extent of damages inflicted by short-time wave propagation to be calculated in the probability sense. Failure modes identified {{in this study are}} all in agreement with what have been observed in industry. This suggests that micron cracks or interfacial flaws initiated at the short-time scale would be further propagated by the CTE-induced thermal stresses at the long-time scale and result in eventual electrical disruptions. Although epoxy-based underfills with fillers were shown to be effective in alleviating thermal stresses and improving solder joint fatigue performance in thermal cycling tests of long-time scale, underfill material viscoelasticity was found to be insignificant in attenuating short-time scale wave propagation. On the other hand, the inclusion of Cu interconnecting layers in <b>flip-chips</b> was shown to perform significantly better than Al layers in suppressing short-time scale effects. These results imply that, if improved flip-chip reliability is to be achieved, all packaging constituent materials need to be formulated to have well-defined short-time scale and long-time scale properties. In addition, the results also suggest that the composition and layout of all packaging components be optimized to achieve discouraging or suppressing short-time scale dynamic effects. In summary, results reported herein and numerical procedures developed for the research would not just render higher packaging manufacturing yield, but also bring out significant impact on packaging development, packaging material formulation and micro-circuit layout design...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The integration of multiple digitally driven processes {{is seen as the}} solution to many of the current limitations arising from standalone Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques. A technique has been developed to digitally fabricate fully functioning electronics using a unique combination of AM technologies. This has been achieved by interleaving bottom-up Stereolithography (SL) with Direct Writing (DW) of conductor materials alongside mid-process development (optimising the substrate surface quality), dispensing of interconnects, component placement and thermal curing stages. The resulting process enables the low-temperature production of bespoke three-dimensional, fully packaged and assembled multi-layer embedded electronic circuitry. Two different Digital Light Processing (DLP) Stereolithography systems were developed applying different projection orientations to fabricate electronic substrates by selective photopolymerisation. The bottom up projection orientation produced higher quality more planar surfaces and demonstrated both a theoretical and practical feature resolution of 110 μm. A top down projection method was also developed however a uniform exposure of UV light and planar substrate surface of high quality could not be achieved. The most advantageous combination of three post processing techniques to optimise the substrate surface quality for subsequent conductor deposition was determined and defined as a mid-processing procedure. These techniques included ultrasonic agitation in solvent, thermal baking and additional ultraviolet exposure. SEM and surface analysis showed that a sequence including ultrasonic agitation in D-Limonene with additional UV exposure was optimal. DW of a silver conductive epoxy was used to print conductors on the photopolymer surface using a Musashi dispensing system that applies a pneumatic pressure to a loaded syringe mounted on a 3 -axis print head and is controlled through CAD generated machine code. The dispensing behaviour of two isotropic conductive adhesives was characterised through three different nozzle sizes for the production of conductor traces as small as 170 μm wide and 40 μm high. Additionally, the high resolution dispensing of a viscous isotropic conductive adhesive (ICA) also led to a novel deposition approach for producing three dimensional, z-axis connections in the form of high freestanding pillars with an aspect ratio of 3. 68 (height of 2 mm and diameter of 550 μm). Three conductive adhesive curing regimes were applied to printed samples to determine the effect of curing temperature and time on the resulting material resistivity. A temperature of 80 °C for 3 hours resulted in the lowest resistivity while displaying no substrate degradation. ii Compatibility with surface mount technology enabled components including resistors, capacitors and chip packages to be placed directly onto the silver adhesive contact pads before low-temperature thermal curing and embedding within additional layers of photopolymer. Packaging of components as small as 0603 surface mount devices (SMDs) was demonstrated via this process. After embedding of the circuitry in a thick layer of photopolymer using the bottom up Stereolithography apparatus, analysis of the adhesive strength at the boundary between the base substrate and embedding layer was conducted showing that loads up to 1500 N could be applied perpendicular to the embedding plane. A high degree of planarization was also found during evaluation of the embedding stage that resulted in an excellent surface finish on which to deposit subsequent layers. This complete procedure could be repeated numerous times to fabricate multilayer electronic devices. This hybrid process was also adapted to conduct flip-chip packaging of bare die with 195 μm wide bond pads. The SL/DW process combination was used to create conductive trenches in the substrate surface that were filled with isotropic conductive adhesive (ICA) to create conductive pathways. Additional experimentation with the dispensing parameters led to consistent 150 μm ICA bumps at a 457 μm pitch. A flip-chip bonding force of 0. 08 N resulted in a contact resistance of 2. 3 Ω at a standoff height of 80 μm. <b>Flip-chips</b> with greater standoff heights of 160 μm were also successfully underfilled with liquid photopolymer using the SL embedding technique, while the same process on chips with 80 μm standoff height was unsuccessful. Finally the approaches were combined to fabricate single, double and triple layer circuit demonstrators; pyramid shaped electronic packages with internal multilayer electronics; fully packaged and underfilled flip-chip bare die and; a microfluidic device facilitating UV catalysis. This new paradigm in manufacturing supports rapid iterative product development and mass customisation of electronics for a specific application and, allows the generation of more dimensionally complex products with increased functionality...|$|E

This new bonding technique has high potential to replace conven-tional <b>flip-chip</b> bonding technique for sensor and actuator systems, optical MEMS, OE-MCMs, and electronic system applications...|$|R

30|$|<b>Flip-chip</b> {{technology}} has been widely used in high-performance and high-density microelectronics packaging [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] due to shorter possible leads, lower inductance, higher frequency, better noise control, smaller device footprints, and a lower profile, such as smart card, laser emitting diode, and surface-acoustic-wave filter in telecom applications [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Flux coating {{is one of the}} key processes during <b>flip-chip</b> packaging; flux is applied on the solder bumps or substrate to remove the oxides, pre-bonding flip chip on the substrate before reflow, and increases the wettability of the solder bump and improve assembly reliability [14, 15, 16]. Usually, flux coating can be achieved through dipping flux, ultrasonic flux, printing flux, and so on [17]. Chip to wafer (C 2 W) <b>flip-chip</b> bonding is more suitable at present for IC integration with expected process flexibility [18]. A flux dipping method was applied to C 2 W bonding [19]. Manna [20] and Nyamannavar et al. [21] reported that effect of fluxing chemical on wire surface by hot dip process and Heat Flux Transients at Solder/Substrate interface. The dipping quantity of <b>flip-chip</b> bumps affects the <b>flip-chip</b> bonding effect. Little flux can result in unbonding, excessive flux influence reliability of <b>flip-chip.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{performance}} of multi-narrow-band spectral analysis was evaluated concerning defect detection in microelectronic components with <b>flip-chip</b> contacts. Today, <b>flip-chip</b> technology is widely applied for interconnecting silicon dies to a substrate within high-end semiconductor packaging technologies. The integrity of the bump solder interconnection is of major concern for the reliability in this technology. Non-destructive defect localization {{and analysis of the}} <b>flip-chip</b> interconnections operating in a semi-automated mode is strongly desired. Scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) combined with subsequent signal analysis has high potential for non-destructive localization of defective <b>flip-chip</b> interconnects. Analyzing multiple narrow spectral bands of signals acquired by a scanning acoustic microscope enabled the identification and localization of defective <b>flip-chip</b> interconnects. In the current study a 180 MHz transducer with 8 mm focal length was employed f or acoustic data acquisition by SAM. Those data were then analyzed off-line by discrete Fourier transformation, chirp z-transform and cosine transform using custom made MATLAB software. Through multi-narrow band spectral analysis, defective <b>flip-chip</b> interconnects that have not been revealed by standard acoustical imaging methods have been detected successfully. Acoustically found defects have been confirmed by subsequent FIB-cross sectioning and SEM imaging. The high resolution SEM imaging revealed complete and partial delamination at the interface between the die and the bump...|$|R

It is demonstrated that the Al layer coated onto a Si submount can effectively reflect downward emitting photons for <b>flip-chip</b> LEDs. Although the operation voltage of the proposed LEDs is slightly increased, {{it is found that}} the output power is at least 30 % higher than that of conventional LEDs. It is also found that <b>flip-chip</b> near-UV LEDs are more reliable than conventional non-flip-chip LEDs...|$|R

As an example, three X-band amplifiers in <b>flip-chip</b> technology are presented that demonstrate the feasibility of the technology...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the assembly process using next generation electroformed stencils and Isotropic Conductive Adhesives (ICAs) as interconnection material. The utilisation of ICAs in <b>flip-chip</b> assembly process is investigated {{as an alternative}} to the lead and lead-free solder alloys and aims to ensure a low temperature (T < 100 °C) assembly process. The paper emphasizes and discusses in details the assembly of a <b>flip-chip</b> package based on copper columns bumped die and substrate with stencil printed ICA deposits at sub- 100 μm pitch. A computational modelling approach is undertaken to provide comprehensive results on reliability trends of ICA joints subject to thermal cycling of the <b>flip-chip</b> assembly based on easy to use damage criteria and damage evaluation. Important design parameters in the package are selected and investigated using numerical modelling techniques to provide knowledge and understanding of their impact on the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the <b>flip-chip</b> ICA joints. Sensitivity analysis of the damage in the adhesive material is also carried out. Optimal design rules for enhanced performance and improved thermo-mechanical reliability of ICA assembled <b>flip-chip</b> packages are finally formulated...|$|R
