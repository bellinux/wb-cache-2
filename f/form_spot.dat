40|$|We {{have used}} {{contemporaneous}} spectra and V light curves to <b>form</b> <b>spot</b> models for RS CVn in 1991 and 1992. More than two spots {{are needed to}} fit all {{the properties of the}} observations. In fact, moderately small spots (22 x 28 deg in latitude and longitude) having only a slight effect on the rotational light curve were eclipsed in both years, and we find that a collection of 6 - 8 such moderate spots is required to fit the line profiles in each year. These groups of spots also account naturally for a difference in level of light between the two years. There is no evidence for polar spots larger than 18 degrees in radius. We have also derived new orbits from radial velocities of the stars, which give the mass ratio Mc/Mh = 1. 04 +/- 0. 02...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{statistical}} model-based approach for the segmentation of fragments of DNA {{as a first}} step in the automation of the primarily manual process of comparing two or more images resulting from the Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning (RLGS) method. These 2 D gel electrophoresis images are the product of the separation of DNA into fragments that appear as spots on X-ray films. The goal is to find instances where a spot appears in one image and not in another since a missing spot can be correlated with a region of DNA that has been affected by a disease such as cancer. The entire comparison process is typically done manually, which is tedious and very error prone. We pose the problem as the labeling of each image pixel as either a spot or non-spot and use a Markov Random Field (MRF) model and simulated annealing for inference. Neighboring spot labels are then connected to <b>form</b> <b>spot</b> regions. The MRF based model was tested on actual 2 D gel electrophoresis images...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{conditions}} in the infrared at 1. 5 microns, including maximum magnetic field strength and temperature, have been observed spectroscopically in 1391 sunspots 1990 to 2009 (1). We emphasize the quantitative difference between our IR sunspot measurements and the visible light results from most solar magnetographs employed world-wide. The latter are compromised by scattered light and measure flux, not field strength. A lower limit of ~ 1800 Gauss is required to <b>form</b> <b>spot</b> umbra. The umbral maximum field strength has declined over the above interval, perhaps because spots have on average diminished in size. The present condition of solar activity minimum has more spotless days than since the 1910 s (2). The Cheshire Cat behavior is related to magnetic surface fields often appearing without accompanying dark spots. Sunspots recently are behaving like a Cheshire Cat: the smile is there (magnetic fields) but the body is missing (no dark markings). We are unsure about past cycles but at present sunspots, with their usual umbrae and penumbrae, are failing to materialize. For hundreds of years the Sun has shown an approximately periodic 11 -year alteration i...|$|E
