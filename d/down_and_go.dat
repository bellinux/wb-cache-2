25|$|Rendezvous {{in orbit}} {{is not a}} {{straightforward}} maneuver. Should a spacecraft increase its speed {{to catch up with}} another, the result is that it goes into a higher and slower orbit and the distance thereby increases. The right procedure is to slow <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> to a lower orbit first, and then later to increase speed and go to the same orbit as the other. To practice these maneuvers special rendezvous and docking simulators were built for the astronauts.|$|E

500|$|... "The D'oh-cial Network" [...] {{was written}} by J. Stewart Burns and {{directed}} by Chris Clements {{as part of the}} twenty-third season of The Simpsons (2011–2012). It was the second episode written by Burns that season, the first being [...] "Holidays of Future Passed". According to Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club, the episode satirizes the phenomenon of the social networking website Facebook. He commented that [...] "the thrust of the satire can be summed up with the age-old cry of parents to their offspring to put that damn thing <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> outside already." [...] Childs added that the episode points out [...] "the most blatant of the many faults of Facebook—namely, its hypnotic ability to distract people in a semi-narcissistic haze [...] ".|$|E

I remember getting her in the stomach really bad one time, and she nearly cut my ear off at one point. It was fun. It was a lot of fun, but we were exhausted as well." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} an early feature of Aerosmith's concerts and a {{frequent}} show closer, including for their first gig in 1970. [...] They wanted to record a live version of the song, but producer Jack Douglas persuaded them to record a studio version, which actually consisted of two {{different versions of the}} song. [...] The first part was slower, [...] "more groove-oriented", while the second was a spirited rocker. [...] To give the second part more of a live sound, Douglas overdubbed crowd noise from The Concert for Bangladesh, the 1971 benefit organized by George Harrison. [...] Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner, who worked with Lou Reed and Alice Cooper, were brought in to record the guitar parts. [...] According to Hunter, [...] "We [...] wanted to keep the solos equal so we'd sit <b>down...</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> through the material so it was totally even...

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from July 9, 1910. It states: [...] "Hal Stephens, a wealthy young man, devotes all his time to enjoying himself, thereby earns the disapproval of his staid old father. The elder Stephen sees the young man start off on an auto trip with some gay friends, and decides to call a halt. He notifies his son by telegram {{that it is time}} he went to work, and presents him with the factory. This arouses the merriment of his friends, but Hal declares that he will buckle <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> to work. He tells his father, however, that he desires to start incognito, and the father consents. Hal enters the factory and goes to work as an ordinary laborer, his identity being unknown to all. He meets Lou, a young working girl, and falls in love with her. The manager of the place, one Conners, tries to make love to Lou, and Hal protects her. There is an order put up reducing salaries 10%, and Lou induces the others to strike rather than to submit. The strikers, starved out, finally return to work, with the exception of Lou, who is defiant to the end. Hal finds her weeping on the steps of her home and tells her of his love. She agrees to marry him. After she has accepted him, he leads her to the factory, announces his identity, assumes possession, and restores wages to the old scale, after having discharged the rogue Conners." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Clown"'s concept {{deals with}} an {{incident}} that happened in San Diego, California. A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's about when you do meth and you look down at your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens when you do too much drugs and your girl wanna get with you and you got some man problems down below. Just another reason not to do drugs, children," [...] Fieldy elaborated.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{planned to}} embark on a tour to promote 20 Y.O. after the album's release around March 2007, with rehearsals {{beginning}} in the end of the previous year. According to a Billboard report in September 2006, she and her choreographers were working on ideas for a world tour, but the singer was still not prepared to share these ideas. However, the unnamed tour was canceled after she signed a record deal with Island Records, and company executives asked her to record a new album instead, which became Discipline. Jackson stated, [...] "I was supposed to go on tour with the last album [...] We were actually in full-blown tour rehearsals at that point ... learning numbers, getting everything together, set designs [...] I had to kind of shut everything <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> into the studio." ...|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, a visibly shaken Ceaușescu gave a halting 5-hour (other {{sources say}} 7-hour) speech that was soon {{interrupted}} by boos. Beginning in a trembling voice, {{he made an}} initial, hopeless attempt to send the miners back to work: “Comrades, {{this is not the}} war… this is a disgrace for the entire nation… a disgrace! I have taken note of your grievances.” He tried to explain the party's policy and appeal to the miners through demagogy, claiming that the party leadership had wanted to reduce working hours but that the miners had resisted, which insult to their intelligence was met by cries of “It is not us! Bandits, thieves!” A general murmur of the crowd ran through the speech, along with protests and outbursts of anger; whenever Ceaușescu began to stumble over his words, some of the men booed and whistled. Proposing that the six-hour day be introduced gradually at Lupeni and then at the other mines, the men replied, “A six-hour day from tomorrow.” Toward the end, when, angered by their audacity, he still refused to grant an immediate six-hour workday, phrases loudly heckled included [...] "He has no idea what the people's interests are" [...] and [...] "He is not concerned with the workers' fundamental interests". Starting to threaten them, Ceaușescu warned that “If you do not go back to work we'll have to stop pussyfooting around!” According to observers, [...] "Down with Ceaușescu!" [...] was then heard after prolonged booing, an account confirmed by Verdeț. Refusing to grasp what was taking place [...] a break between Party and workers on a scale unprecedented in Communist Romania , he was both shocked by his inability to connect with the workers and frightened for his physical safety (once in the workers' midst, there was little chance for law enforcement to protect him). Only when Dobre seized the microphone and urged the miners to let Ceaușescu finish did the atmosphere become less charged. At that point he saw that his only exit lay in making conciliatory promises {{he had no intention of}} honouring; using the wooden language that miners trust, he promised to resolve their grievances (agreeing to a six-hour workday for everyone, with Saturdays and Sundays off, and to build factories that would provide jobs for miners' wives and daughters), vowed those responsible for the miners' discontent would be brought to account and that there would be no retribution, and was applauded. [...] "Calm <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>go</b> back to work", he said, after which, exhausted by the speech and the tension which made him feel insecure, he felt physically weak when leaving the platform, having to lean on one of his men. Verdeț and Pană were released and the strike came to an end immediately after Ceaușescu's departure, the men dispersing and some going into the mines for the August 3 evening shift. They even offered to make up the time lost during the strike.|$|E
