50|$|Padillasaurus is {{distinguished}} among other titanosauriforms in having its caudal vertebrae weakly expanded to the sides, and displaying divided side projections.. The species shows some typical basic features of Titanosauriformes: the vertebra is opisthocoelic, with a convex front section {{and the back}} concave. The edges show large pleurocoels, pneumatic processes that connected to the hollow interior {{of the body of}} the vertebra, which consisted of several hollow cavities. The spine also had an additional lamina between the diapophysis and the body of the vertebra. The anterior caudal vertebrae are flattened or slightly concave from the front and from behind, or vice versa. His neural arches are positioned relatively forward. These have long ridges that run between the protuberances of the <b>joint</b> <b>face</b> and body of the vertebra. The side projections are oriented obliquely backwards and have a convex lower area. The caudal vertebrae have a height equal to half of its width.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, {{more and}} more {{applications}} need to jointly align a set of facial images from one specific person, which forms the so-called <b>joint</b> <b>face</b> alignment problem. To address this problem, in this paper, starting from an initial face alignment results, we propose to enhance the alignments by a fundamentally novel idea: rescuing the bad align-ments with their well-aligned neighbors. In our method, a discriminative alignment evaluator is well designed to assess the initial face alignments and separate the well-aligned images from the badly-aligned ones. To cor-rect the bad ones, a robust regularized re-fitting algorithm is proposed by exploiting the appearance consistency between the badly-aligned im-age and its k well-aligned nearest neighbors. Experiments conducted on faces in the wild demonstrate that our method greatly improves the ini-tial face alignment results of an off-the-shelf facial landmark locator. In addition, the effectiveness of our method is validated through compar-ing with other state-of-the-art methods in <b>joint</b> <b>face</b> alignment under complex conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Most of the {{existing}} methods for the recognition of faces and expressions consider either the expression-invariant face recognition problem or the identity-independent facial expression recognition problem. In this paper, we propose <b>joint</b> <b>face</b> and facial expression recognition using a dictionary-based component separation algorithm (DCS). In this approach, the given expressive face {{is viewed as a}} superposition of a neutral face component with a facial expression component which is sparse with respect to the whole image. This assumption leads to a dictionary-based component separation algorithm which benefits from the idea of sparsity and morphological diversity. This entails building data-driven dictionaries for neutral and expressive components. The DCS algorithm then uses these dictionaries to decompose an expressive test face into its constituent components. The sparse codes we obtain {{as a result of this}} decomposition are then used for <b>joint</b> <b>face</b> and expression recognition. Experiments on publicly available expression and face datasets show the effectiveness of our method.

40|$|An {{analytical}} method is presented for {{the calculation of}} the load carrying capacity of two-dimensional asymmetric rock wedges when the loading on the <b>joint</b> <b>faces</b> is non symmetric, such as {{the case of an}} asymmetric wedge formed in the roof of a circular tunnel in an inclined stress field. The pull out force that causes yield at one of the <b>joint</b> <b>faces</b> is evaluated from formulae based on the limiting equilibrium conditions assuming a purely frictional joint resistance. Next, the total pull out force required for the secondary face to yield is calculated. During this step, the wedge is further displaced and while the primary yielding face is plastically deformed, the other face is still in the elastic range until failure. Validation of the analytical procedure is obtained with the UDEC code, which provides an implementation of the Distinct Element Method in two dimensions. When the assumptions made in the analytical procedure are valid, the analytically calculated values for the pull out resistance of the wedge are computed to be close to the numerically obtained ones...|$|R

30|$|When {{concrete}} slabs {{are subjected to}} loads, bearing stresses and deflection are mainly affected by the spacing of dowel bars. Decreased dowel bar spacing results in the reduction in bearing stresses and deflection. However, if dowel bar spacing decreases to less than 203  mm (8  in), a horizontal plane of weakness in the concrete slab at the <b>joint</b> <b>face</b> will occur. On the contrary, the increased dowel bar spacing leads to excessive bearing stresses and deflection at the joint.

Thus, the compressive stress of the bottom beam bars at the <b>joint</b> <b>face</b> would be {{greater than that of}} the top beam bars at the opposite face. In other words, the stress gradient along the bottom bars is larger than that along the top bars in the joint, indicating a relatively severe bond demand for the bottom bars.|$|E

We {{present a}} <b>joint</b> <b>face</b> {{alignment}} technique {{that takes a}} set of images as input and produces a set of shape- and appearance-consistent face alignments as output.

We are inspired by the recent joint alignment method of Zhao et al. [20], which employs a modified Active Appearance Model (AAM) approach to align a batch of images. We introduce an approach for simultaneously optimizing both a local appearance constraint, which couples the local estimates between multiple images, and a global shape constraint, which couples landmarks and images across the image set. In video sequences, our method greatly improves the temporal stability of landmark esti-mates without compromising accuracy relative to ground truth. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{has focused on}} face and facial expression recognition using two-dimensional and three-dimensional face images. After a short presentation of the relative bibliography, we present a new face recognition algorithm based on the level-curves (or iso-curves) of the facial depth function. The advantage {{of this approach is}} that surface matching is reduced to planar curve matching. The latter is better studied and leads to improved recognition performance in comparison with other techniques that treat face as a rigid surface. However, the previous technique cannot handle face deformation due to expressions that leads to lower recognition rate. Therefore, a new technique for expression-invariant recognition is presented. This technique {{is based on the assumption}} that face is deformed isometrically and uses a geodesic polar parameterization of the face to construct expression invariant attribute images. Our technique was compared to other techniques that use geodesic distances between facial points and found to improve performance and handle theoretical and practical problems at the same time. In the following, we describe a new expression recognition technique. First we detect several anatomical points such as the eyes, nose, lips, et. c. by fitting a deformable model to the target face and then we classify the expression of the face based on spacial relations between anatomical point by means of rule-based classifiers. The rules of the latter are found using swarm optimization techniques, namely ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization. These methods rely on the collective behavior of a number of agents to optimize an objective function, which in our case defines classification rules. Despite their simplicity, they were shown to result in high recognition rates. Finally, we present a new method for <b>joint</b> <b>face</b> and facial expression recognition. Instead of trying to devise suitable feature vectors invariant to unwanted sources of variation, we propose encoding the contribution of each face appearance component (identity and expression) into independent parameters allowing separate control and thus <b>joint</b> <b>face</b> and expression recognition. Identity and expression are decoupled using two bilinear models, a symmetric and an asymmetric one. Experimental results on public face databases showed that the symmetric model favors face recognition while the asymmetric model favors expression recognition. ...|$|E

To this end, a suitable optimization problem, involving the minimization of the nuclear norm and the matrix ℓ_ 1 norm, is solved.

40|$|Concrete {{pavements}} are {{an important}} part of our national infrastructure. In recent years the relatively small number of reported joints deteriorating prematurely in concrete pavements around Indiana has increased. Changes over the past 45 years in INDOT specification, pavement materials, designs and construction practices, and current de-icing materials were examined and related to the durability of concrete at the joints of existing pavements. A survey of concrete pavements across the state revealed that no pavements from the two southern districts less than 40 years old showed this distress except in more recently placed patches. Cores were retrieved from the joints and mid-panel of 11 pavement sections that represented different materials, ages, construction, deicer exposure, and different levels of deterioration, from non-deteriorated concrete to concrete with severe deterioration at the joints. The pavement base drained well at the mid-panel of most pavements but was reduced at the joints for over half the pavements with the most severe joint deterioration associated with the slowest drainage. None of the concrete had an air void system that met all the criteria recommended for FT durable concrete but was better at the mid-panel than at the joints. Infilling and lining of the entrained air voids with ettringite and some Friedel’s salt was more common near the joints and could account for the reduced air void system. The FT testing did not correlate directly with the air void parameters but generally mid-panel samples did test as more durable than joints. Evidence from the presence of unhydrated cement grains suggested that the concrete at the <b>joint</b> <b>face</b> was not fully cured. One pavement section that did not have fly ash had worse deterioration than the panels nearby that had fly ash and calcium hydrate was more noticeable in the concrete from joints with severe deterioration. Several variables were identified that influence the durability of the concrete at the joints and there may be other variables that were beyond the scope or capacity of this study. In summary this study identified the following variables likely influenced the durability of the concrete at the joints: the drainability of the base at the joints, original air void system, reduced air void parameters due to lining and infilling of the air voids with secondary minerals, poor hydration of the concrete at the <b>joint</b> <b>face</b> and increased moisture at the joint...|$|E
