40|$|Abstract: The IMF {{uses its}} {{well-known}} “financial programming ” model to derive monetary and fiscal programs to achieve desired macroeconomic targets in countries undergoing crises or receiving debt relief. This paper considers {{under what conditions}} <b>financial</b> <b>programming</b> would work best, and then tests those conditions in the data. The key restrictions of <b>financial</b> <b>programming</b> are assumptions about exogeneity of some components of identities with respect to others, and the assumption of stable and “reasonable ” parameters for some very simple behavioral relationships. In at least the literal applications of the framework, <b>financial</b> <b>programming</b> does not do well in forecasting the target variables, even when some components of the identity are known with certainty. 3 Acknowledgements: I am grateful for comments by Maria Carkovic, Shanta Devarajan, Atis...|$|R

40|$|Most African {{governments have}} made {{considerable}} progress in pursuing macroeconomic stabilization, usually {{under the tutelage}} of the International Monetary Fund. Policy targets for the IMF-supported programs are universally derived from some variation of the standard <b>financial</b> <b>programming</b> methodology. Yet most governments in the region remain dependent on the Fund for the technical analysis. This technical dependency often engenders a lack of ownership of program targets, and the targets themselves are often unrealistic, on the side of austerity. This paper makes the case that African governments must now develop their own <b>financial</b> <b>programming</b> models and system, to take command of the technical analysis, negotiate with the Fund in more pro-active terms, and establish the foundation for a deeper commitment to prudent macroeconomic policy management. Every country has economists who have been trained in <b>financial</b> <b>programming.</b> This is a start, but a concerted effort is needed to develop practical, customized applications, with supporting systems to implement, maintain and refine the models. The paper outlines the basic structure of a generic <b>financial</b> <b>programming</b> model, explains the importance of developing the capacity for home-grown programming, and briefly addresses som...|$|R

40|$|Poverty {{alleviation}} {{is typically}} addressed in <b>financial</b> <b>programming</b> through additive programs that target vulnerable groups but without modifying the underlying stabilization and adjustment targets. Instead, this paper integrates the poverty alleviation objective into the <b>financial</b> <b>programming</b> framework using a well-known poverty index. In consequence, {{the assessment of}} trade-offs between competing objectives is facilitated. A simulation demonstrates how the integrated approach can reduce adverse effects on poverty and improve the balance of payments, although at the cost, temporarily, of a higher fiscal deficit and inflation. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>financial</b> {{incentive}} <b>programs,</b> which have become an increasingly common component of welfare programs. We review experimental evidence from several such <b>programs.</b> <b>Financial</b> incentive <b>programs</b> appear to increase work and raise income (lower poverty), but cost somewhat more than alternative welfare programs. In particular, windfall beneficiaries [...] those {{who would have been}} working anyway [...] can raise costs by participating in the program. Several existing programs limit this effect by targeting long-term welfare recipients or by limiting benefits to full-time workers. At the same time, because <b>financial</b> incentive <b>programs</b> transfer support to working low-income families, the increase in costs due to windfall beneficiaries makes these programs more effective at alleviating poverty and raising incomes. Evidence also indicates that combining <b>financial</b> incentive <b>programs</b> with job search and job support services can increase both employment and income gains. Non-experimental evidence from the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and from state Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) programs with enhanced earnings disregards also suggests that these programs increase employment, and this evidence is consistent with the experimental evidence on {{the impact of}} <b>financial</b> incentive <b>program.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{research}} {{advocates a}} positive, linear association between relationship investments and relationship performance. Our study challenges this conventional wisdom and advances the extant literature by investigating the potential curvilinear effects of suppliers' different relationship marketing programs (i. e., social, financial, and structural) on dyadic perceptions of relationship value. From {{an analysis of}} 113 buyer-supplier dyads, we found that social programs enhance relationship value synergy, but their effect on relationship value asymmetry between suppliers and buyers follows a U-shaped curve. On the other hand, we observe a positive and increasing returns-to-scale effect of <b>financial</b> <b>programs</b> on relationship value synergy and its inverted U-shaped association with supplier's relationship value asymmetry. Interestingly, structural programs increase relationship value synergy and have a stronger effect on increasing relationship value for the supplier than for the buyer. In addition, we find that structural programs are more effective in creating value in long-term relationships than in short-term relationships; therefore, as the relationship with a buying firm ages, managers should consider investing more in structural programs to develop their relationship. However, in long-term relationships, managers should avoid investing too much in <b>financial</b> <b>programs</b> because <b>financial</b> <b>programs</b> are less effective in increasing creation of relationship value as a relationship ages...|$|R
