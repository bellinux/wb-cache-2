5|$|Actual {{rates of}} {{diffusion}} and perfusion, and solubility of gases in specific physiological tissues are not generally known, and vary considerably. However mathematical {{models have been}} proposed that approximate the real situation to a <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> lesser extent. These models predict whether symptomatic bubble formation is likely to occur for a given dive profile. Algorithms based on these models produce decompression tables. In personal dive computers, they produce a real-time estimate of decompression status and display it for the diver.|$|E

5|$|Stacking or rigging the subwoofers in a {{vertical}} array focuses the low frequencies {{forward to a}} <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. This helps {{reduce the amount of}} low frequency sound bouncing off the ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.|$|E

5|$|The swans, {{ducks and}} geese are medium to large birds that are adapted to an aquatic {{existence}} with webbed feet and bills which are flattened to a <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> lesser extent. In many ducks the male is colourful while the female is dull brown. The diet consists {{of a variety of}} animals and plants. The family is well represented in the counties, especially in winter when large numbers visit from further north.|$|E
5|$|The tail appears {{naked and}} is shorter than or {{about as long}} as the head and body; it is longer in T.talamancae.

The scales on the tail are smaller than in T.talamancae.|$|E

It is being produced by Amy Redford (daughter of actor/director Robert Redford), Irwin Shapiro and Rick Singer. In an interview a year earlier, Cassidy's parents suggested Kirsten Dunst or Emily Watson as possible actresses who could play their daughter.|$|E

5|$|Nest {{success in}} {{undisturbed}} sites is high, at 80–90%, but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land. The method {{and timing of}} mowing is crucial; mechanized mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks in a given site, and losses average 50% of first brood chicks and somewhat less than 40% of second brood chicks. The influence of weather on chick survival is limited; although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother to a <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> lesser extent until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched {{is more important than}} the weather, with lower survival in large broods. The annual adult survival rate is under 30%, although some individuals may live for 5–7 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} criticised by big game hunter and {{politician}} Theodore Roosevelt for its central assertion that {{every aspect of}} animal coloration is effective as camouflage. Roosevelt's detailed reply attacked the biased choice of examples to suit Abbott Thayer's thesis and the book's reliance on unsubstantiated claims in place of evidence. The book was more evenly criticised by zoologist and camouflage researcher Hugh Cott, who valued Thayer's work on countershading but regretted his overenthusiastic attempts to explain all animal coloration as camouflage. Thayer was mocked to a <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> lesser extent by other scientific reviewers.|$|E
5|$|A {{high risk}} day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} may be on the ground for a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is <b>greater</b> <b>or</b> the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E
