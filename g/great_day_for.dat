As Green wrote, [...] "there will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published.

The artwork inside the CD liner notes revolves around a similar theme, with the image of the two heads formed by various other objects, such as newspapers ("A <b>Great</b> <b>Day</b> <b>for</b> Freedom"), coloured glass ("Poles Apart"), and boxing gloves ("Lost for Words"). Pages two and three portray a picture from the Chilean Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The CD tray itself had the name of Pink Floyd printed in Braille on the left front side.|$|E
500|$|Thatcher, {{sharing the}} {{concerns}} of French President François Mitterrand, was initially opposed to German reunification, telling Gorbachev that it [...] "would lead to a change to postwar borders, and we cannot allow that because such a development would undermine {{the stability of the}} whole international situation and could endanger our security". She expressed concern that a united Germany would align itself more closely with the Soviet Union and move away from NATO. In March 1990, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl reassured Thatcher that he would keep her [...] "informed of all his intentions about unification", and that he was prepared to disclose [...] "matters which even his cabinet would not know". In November 1989, Thatcher hailed the fall of the Berlin Wall as [...] "a <b>great</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> freedom".|$|E

500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 20 February 1961 dozens of ITAK volunteers staged a satyagraha at the Jaffna Kachcheri. Among them were several ITAK MPs {{including}} Chelvanayakam. As Government Agent M. Srikantha and Superintendent of Police Richard Arndt tried to leave Old Park in a jeep the protesters blocked their way. The police baton charged the protestors, kicking and dragging them away. Several protestors, including ITAK MPs A. Amirthalingam, V. Dharmalingam, V. A. Kandiah, E. M. V. Naganathan and K. Thurairatnam were injured. The police fired tear gas to disperse a large crowd that had gathered to watch the satyagraha. At {{the end of the day}} Chelvanayakam issued a press statement saying that it was [...] "a <b>great</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> the Tamil-speaking people of Ceylon.

500|$|Produced a {{few years}} after the {{collapse}} of the Eastern Bloc, [...] "A <b>Great</b> <b>Day</b> <b>for</b> Freedom" [...] juxtaposes the general euphoria of, for instance, the fall of the Berlin Wall, with the subsequent wars and ethnic cleansing, particularly in Yugoslavia. Audio samples of Stephen Hawking, originally recorded for a BT television advertisement, were used in [...] "Keep Talking"; Gilmour was so moved by Hawking's sentiment in the advert that he contacted the advertising company for permission to use the recordings on the album. Mason said it felt [...] "politically incorrect to take ideas from advertising, but it seemed a very relevant piece." [...] At the end of the album Gilmour's stepson Charlie is heard hanging up the telephone receiver on Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke, who had pleaded to be allowed to appear on a Pink Floyd album.|$|E
500|$|Notices {{were posted}} on churches forbidding worship services, and priests who objected were arrested. Buses were stopped and their {{passengers}} searched by armed troops. The Winnipeg Tribune was renamed Das Winnipeger Lügenblatt ("The Winnipeg Lies-sheet"), a 'Nazi' publication featuring heavily censored columns and a front page written almost entirely in German. One satirical story noted that [...] "this is a <b>great</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> Manitoba...The Nazis, like Der Fuehrer, are patient, kind and tolerant, but THEIR PATIENCE IS RAPIDLY EXHAUSTED BECOMING", while another included an [...] "official joke", {{approved by the}} German authorities, at which all readers were ordered to laugh or be imprisoned. Henry Weppler, a newspaper seller for the Winnipeg Free Press, was attacked and his papers ripped up. The Winnipeg Free Press featured a front-page story about the [...] "invasion", describing in great detail the devastation caused by the Nazis in Winnipeg.|$|E
2500|$|Iorga only {{returned}} to Bucharest as Romania resumed its {{contacts with the}} Allies and the Deutsches Heer left the country. The political uncertainty ended by late autumn, when the Allied victory on the Western Front sealed Germany's defeat. Celebrating the Compiègne Armistice, Iorga wrote: [...] "There can be no <b>greater</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> the entire world". Iorga however found that Bucharest had become [...] "a filthy hell under lead skies." [...] His celebrated return also included the premiere of Învierea lui Ștefan cel Mare at the National Theater, which continued to host productions of his dramatic texts on a regular basis, until ca. 1936.|$|R

50|$|Qualifying {{proved to}} be one of the <b>greatest</b> <b>days</b> <b>for</b> the small French Welter Racing team, rivaling its 400 kph speed record on the Mulsanne {{straight}} in 1988. Ever the builder of small, nimble and very fast prototypes, Gérard Welter's latest version, the WR LM95, was no exception: both cars, driven by William David and Patrick Gonin locked out the front row of the grid for the great race. David was the first driver to take pole on debut. Curiously, it was also the first time that two single-seaters had been on the front row at Le Mans since the 1967 French F1 GP that was run there.|$|R
500|$|In 1924, Ferdinand and Marie {{undertook}} a diplomatic tour of France, Switzerland, Belgium and the United Kingdom. In England, she was warmly welcomed by George V, who declared that [...] "apart {{from the common}} aims, which we pursue, there are other and dear ties between us. Her Majesty the Queen, my dear cousin, is British born." [...] Similarly, Marie wrote that {{the day of her}} arrival in England was [...] "a <b>great</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> me, one of emotions, sweet, happy and the same time glorious emotions to come back as Queen to my own country, to be received officially, in all honour and enthusiastically into the bargain – to feel your heart swell with pride and satisfaction, to feel your heart beat and tears start into your eyes, while something gave you a lump into your throat!" [...] These state visits were a symbolic recognition of the prestige Romania had gained after World War I. Whilst visiting Geneva, Marie and Ferdinand became the first royals to enter the newly established headquarters of the League of Nations.|$|E
500|$|After {{struggling}} {{through the}} war years, the Ottawa Hockey Association put the Club {{up for sale}} for $5,000 {{in the fall of}} 1917. Montreal Canadiens' owner George Kennedy [...] was leading an effort to get rid of Toronto Blueshirts' owner Eddie Livingstone, and he needed the Senators in his corner. He loaned Ottawa Citizen sports editor Tommy Gorman (who also doubled as a press representative for the Canadiens) $2,500 to help buy into the Senators. Gorman, along with Martin Rosenthal and Ted Dey (owner of The Arena), bought the club. At a meeting held at Montreal's Windsor Hotel, the Senators, Canadiens, Wanderers and Bulldogs formed a new league—the National Hockey League—effectively leaving Livingstone in the NHA by himself. [...] Gorman represented the Senators at the meeting. [...] "A <b>great</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> hockey," [...] he was quoted as saying, [...] "Without [...] we can get down to the business of making money." [...] Within a year, Gorman and partner Ted Dey had made enough money to pay back Kennedy. Gorman also attended the following year's meeting of the NHA owners in which the final vote to suspend the league was made.|$|E
500|$|Davidson {{described}} the event as [...] "strange" [...] {{and stated that}} he had the pace to take the victory and had luck to his advantage while other competitors had problems: [...] "I had everything crossed but it wasn’t meant to be today. That’s racing I suppose but it sure does hurt sometimes.” After finishing in 26th, Webber said it had been an tough event for his team and revealed that they were confident that they could have battled for the victory had his car not sustained two punctured tyres: [...] "It just goes to show how hard endurance racing can be. We’re all right on the limit and as we’ve seen here that’s causing quite a high rate of attrition. Third time lucky at Le Mans is the plan." [...] Mücke stated that he felt okay after his heavy crash and thanked his team for constructing a safe vehicle. The {{chief executive officer of the}} World Endurance Championship Gerard Neveu {{described the}} event as [...] "a <b>great</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> motorsport" [...] but felt that it was slightly strange. He revealed that after the race, he had organised a meeting with several people and raised the question of why [...] "there was so much aggression and action in Spa. It's quite simple: the cars are all so close together, the competition is so hard as never before. It can happen at any time - that is exciting...".|$|E

In spite of their long years of disciplined education, he was finding himself their {{intellectual}} equal, and the hours spent with them in conversation was so much practice for him in the use of the grammar he had studied so hard. He had abandoned the etiquette books, falling back upon observation to show him the right things to do. Except when carried away by his enthusiasm, he was always on guard, keenly watchful of their actions and learning their little courtesies and refinements of conduct.|$|R

When Huckabee appeared on Fox News' Hannity and Colmes to discuss his straw poll showing and future plans, he expressed confidence in his New Hampshire effort and said that [...] "we have a great team in New Hampshire. I'm very confident we're going to surprise people in New Hampshire just like we did Iowa. Also in the week following the Straw Poll, Huckabee continued {{to talk of the}} momentum his campaign gained from his 2nd place showing.

2500|$|The New York Times asked seven {{academics}} to opine on how corporate {{money would}} reshape {{politics as a}} result of the court's decision. Three of the seven wrote that the effects would be minimal or positive: Christopher Cotton, a University of Miami School of Business assistant professor of economics, wrote that [...] "There may be very little difference between seeing eight ads or seeing nine ads (compared to seeing one ad or two). And, voters recognize that richer candidates are not necessarily the better candidates, and in some cases, the benefit of running more ads is offset by the negative signal that spending a lot of money creates. Eugene Volokh, a professor of law at UCLA, stated that the [...] "most influential actors in most political campaigns" [...] are media corporations which [...] "overtly editorialize for and against candidates, and also influence elections by choosing what to cover and how to cover it". Holding that corporations like Exxon would fear alienating voters by supporting candidates, the decision really meant that voters would hear [...] "more messages from more sources". Joel Gora, a professor at Brooklyn Law School who had previously argued the case of Buckley v. Valeo on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that the decision represented [...] "a <b>great</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> the First Amendment" [...] writing that the Court had [...] "dismantled the First Amendment 'caste system' in election speech".|$|E
60|$|At last, {{with his}} usual fatality, the curate fixed the grand {{practice}} for the Saturday evenings that were Rachel's <b>great</b> <b>days</b> <b>for</b> instruction in the three R's, and for a sort of popular lecture. Cricket was to succeed the singing, and novelty carried the day, but only by the desertion of her scholars did Rachel learn the new arrangement, and she could hardly credit the assertion that the curate was not aware {{that it was her}} day. In fact, it was the only one when the fisher lads were sure not to be at sea, and neither party would yield it. Mr. Touchett was determined not to truckle to dictation from the great house; so when Rachel declared she would {{have nothing to do with}} the boys unless the Saturdays were conceded to her, he owned that he thought the clergyman had the first right to his lads, and had only not claimed them before out of deference for the feelings of a well-meaning parishioner.|$|R

In shop windows with curtains of fluted silk were silver things and jade; satin gowns and shoe-buckles of rhinestones. The sleek motor-cars whisked by in an incessant line; the traffic policemen nodded familiarly to hansom-drivers; pools on the asphalt mirrored the delicate sky, and at every corner the breeze tasted of spring.|$|R
2500|$|The hollow [...] "square" [...] had again progressed {{several hundred}} yards beyond the {{flanking}} batteries, but Cumberland had become increasingly isolated in the centre with his shrinking mass of British and Hanoverian infantry. The allies grew indecisive. Löwendahl saw the true state of affairs, and galloped off to meet with Saxe. [...] "Well, monsieur le maréchal, here is a <b>great</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> his Majesty. These fellows will never get themselves out of a fix like that." [...] After a council with Louis XV it was resolved to unite all available forces, and at around 2:00pm, Saxe made a final concerted effort to repulse the enemy. Four pieces of reserve artillery, loaded with grape-shot, were brought into action, and every available regiment mustered. Saxe rallied six Irish battalions of the [...] "Wild Geese" [...] supported by the remnants of Vaisseaux and Normandie for a final assault and flung themselves into the attack with the wild Gaelic cry of [...] "Cuimhnigidh ar Luimnech agus feall na Sassonach!" [...] – [...] "Remember Limerick and Saxon Perfidy". The Irish Brigade, as a brigade, would suffer the heaviest overall casualties on the French side, losing 656 men including one-quarter of their officers. Sergeant Wheelock of Bulkeley captured a colour and the attack of the Irish compelled the British Guards to retire. A simultaneous attack on the allied left was made by all the regiments which had faced the Dutch between Fontenoy and Antoing. Meanwhile, the French Guards, now led by the Comte de Chabannes, eager for revenge, with fixed bayonets charged the front so closely that fire was exchanged muzzle to muzzle. As Saxe and Löwendahl led the infantry, D'Estrées, and Richelieu brought up the whole Household Cavalry. The fighting was extremely close and deadly, some British regiments lost half their strength such as the Royal Welch Fusiliers which lost 322 soldiers, over 200 killed, while the brigade of British Guards suffered over 700 casualties. The French counter-attacks eventually halted and then repelled the British column, taking the field.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next five months, the 39th Battalion rotated between the front line and rear areas, holding the line in Belgium {{throughout}} winter. In the spring of 1918, when the German Army launched its last effort at victory, known as the Spring Offensive, the 39th was among the many Australian battalions that were hurriedly moved south to France in order to stem the tide of the German onslaught towards Amiens; fighting a series of defensive actions in the Somme between late March and early June. When the Allies launched their own offensive—the Hundred Days Offensive—on 8 August 1918, the battalion along with the rest of the 10th Brigade, was serving as the divisional reserve and they did not participate in the advance that has since become known as one of the <b>greatest</b> <b>days</b> <b>for</b> the Allies on the Western Front. On 10 August, the battalion was committed to battle once more, undertaking an attack on the village of Proyart, but this attack was ill-conceived and ultimately failed. Despite this, the battalion remained in the line throughout August and early September as the 3rd Division advanced through the Somme Valley.|$|R
