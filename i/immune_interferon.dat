Virus-induced interferon alone (25,OOO U/day) delayed tumor development and increased survival time. The mouse <b>immune</b> <b>interferon</b> preparations significantly en-hanced or potentiated the antitumor effects of mouse virus-induced interferon when the interferons were used in combined therapy. -JNCI 65 : 963 - 966, 1980. Although interferon was originally described as an antiviral substance (1), it has been abundantly demon-strated to possess an antitumor activity. Three types of human interferon have been described: fibroepithelial, leukocyte, and immune (2 - 4). In the mouse system, viruses and polyribonucleotides may induce a mixture of two types of interferons (fibroepithelial and leuko-cyte?) (5 - 7). This interferon is hereafter referred to as virus-induced interferon. Mouse <b>immune</b> <b>interferon</b> is induced by antigens and mitogens (8 - 10). Fleischmann et al. recently reported (11) that mixed preparations of mouse virus-induced interferon and mouse <b>immune</b> <b>interferon</b> cause the development of a greater level of antiviral protection than would be expected {{on the basis of their}} individual activities.

The kinetics of development of the antiviral state were slow for <b>immune</b> <b>interferon</b> relative to those for leukocyte interferon. Ultrogel AcA 54 chromatography of crude or the concentrated interferon resulted in two peaks of activity, a major one (87 % of recovered activity) with a molecular weight of 40, 000 to 46, 000 and a minor peak of molecular weight 65, 000 to 70, 000.

40|$|Tripartite motif-containing 32 (TRIM 32) {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to pay vital roles in cancer, genetic disorders and antiviral immunity. However, the molecular functions of fish TRIM 32 still remained largely unknown. Here, a novel TRIM 32 gene from orange spotted grouper (EcTRIM 32) was cloned and characterized. EcTRIM 32 encoded a 685 -aa protein which showed 93 %, and 60 % identity to large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) and human (Homo sapiens), respectively. Amino acid alignment showed that EcTRIM 32 contained a conserved RING-finger domain, a BBOX domain and NHL domain. In healthy grouper, the transcript of EcTRIM 32 was predominantly detected in brain, liver, intestine, spleen and skin. After injection with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) and polyl:C, the relative expression of EcTRIM 32 in grouper spleen was differently regulated, suggested that EcTRIM 32 was involved in antiviral immune response. In transfected grouper spleen (GS) cells, EcTRIM 32 displayed bright fluorescence aggregates or spots in the cytoplasm. Notably, the deletion RING domain altered its precise localization and distributed throughout the cytoplasm in GS cells. In EcTRIM 32 overexpressing cells, the replication of SGIV or red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) was significantly inhibited compared to the vector control cells. Moreover, the overexpression of EcTRIM 32 positively regulated the <b>interferon</b> <b>immune</b> response, evidenced by the significant increase of the expression level of interferon related signaling molecules, including interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF 3), IRF 7, interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG 15), interferon-induced 35 -kDa protein (IFP 35), MXI, TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA 5). Further studies showed that overexpression of EcTRIM 32 significantly enhanced the MDA 5 -mediated <b>interferon</b> <b>immune</b> response, but decreased stimulator of interferon genes (STING) -mediated <b>interferon</b> <b>immune</b> response. Meanwhile, the expression levels of pro-inflammation cytokines, including TNF alpha, IL- 6 and IL- 8 were up regulated by the ectopic expression of EcTRIM 32. We speculated that the regulation of IRF 7, and pro inflammation cytokines by EcTRIM 32 overexpression might contribute critical roles in SGIV infection. In addition, the deletion of RING domain not only significantly weakened the antiviral roles of EcTRIM 32, but also obviously affected the regulatory effects of EcTRIM 32 on <b>interferon</b> <b>immune</b> and inflammation response. Together, our results firstly demonstrated that fish TRIM 32 acted as an antiviral factor against both DNA and RNA virus infection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Increased reports {{uncovered}} that mammalian tripartite motif-containing 62 (TRIM 62) exerts crucial {{roles in}} cancer and innate immune response. However, {{the roles of}} fish TRIM 62 in antiviral immune response remained uncertain. In this study, a TRIM 62 gene was cloned from orange spotted grouper (EcTRIM 62) and its roles in grouper RNA virus infection was elucidated in vitro. EcTRIM 62 shared 99 % and 83 % identity to bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) and human (Homo sapiens), respectively. Sequence alignment indicated that EcTRIM 62 contained three domains, including a RING-finger domain, a B-box domain and a SPRY domain. In healthy grouper, the transcript of EcTRIM 62 was predominantly detected in brain and liver, followed by heart, skin, spleen, fin, gill, intestine, and stomach. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that bright fluorescence spots were observed in the cytoplasm of EcTRIM 62 -transfected grouper spleen (GS) cells. During red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis (RGNNV) infection, overexpression of EcTRIM 62 significantly enhanced the severity of CPE and increased viral gene transcriptions. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of EcTRIM 62 significantly decreased the transcription level of interferon signaling molecules, including interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF 3), IRF 7, interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG 15), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA 5), myxovirus resistance gene MXI, and MXII, suggesting that the negative regulation of <b>interferon</b> <b>immune</b> response by EcTRIM 62 might directly contributed to its enhancing effect on RGNNV replication. Furthermore, our results also demonstrated that overexpression of EcTRIM 62 was able to differently regulate the expression levels of pro-inflammation cytokines. In addition, we found the ectopic expression of EcTIRM 62 negatively regulated MDA 5 -, but not mediator of IRF 3 activation (MITA) -induced <b>interferon</b> <b>immune</b> response. Further studies showed that the deletion of RING domain and SPRY domain significantly affected the action of EcTRIM 62, including the enhancing effect on virus replication and regulation of <b>interferon</b> <b>immune</b> response.

Maximum cell proliferative responses ([3 H]thymidine incorporation) and protein synthesis (14 C-amino acid incorporation) occurred on days 3 and 4, respectively, after stimulation {{by each of}} the three mitogens. Maximal <b>immune</b> <b>interferon</b> levels were found 3 or 4 days after mitogen stimulation. SEA-treated cultures produced approximately three times more interferon than did cultures stimulated with PHA-P or ConA. Furthermore, SEA stimulated maximal cell proliferation over a much broader concentration range than did PHA-P and ConA (SEA, 10 − 5 to 102 μg/ml; PHA-P, 101 to 102 μg/ml; ConA, 101 to 101. 5 μg/ml). Interferon was also produced at maximal or near maximal levels over a broad concentration range of SEA (10 − 2 to 102 μg/ml). Also, we found that inhibition of mitogen-induced DNA and protein synthesis to control levels by mitomycin C or cytosine arabinoside partially reduced interferon production. The DNA inhibitor studies indicate that <b>immune</b> <b>interferon</b> synthesis occurs maximally in association with at least some proliferative response and that submaximal levels of interferon production occur in mitogen-treated cultures in the absence of detectable proliferation.

Adherence of immune interferon-producing cells to target cells was observed only when L cell-sensitized spleen cells were cocultured with L cells or with mouse embryo cells derived from C 3 H mice. Fixation of antigenic cells with methyl alcohol or paraformaldehyde significantly reduced cell adherence. When L cells alone or sensitized spleen cells alone were pretreated separately with cytochalasin D, neither cell type could bind to partner cells. Specific adherence {{did not take place}} at 4 degrees C, nor in the presence of dinitrophenol or sodium azide. Continuous protein synthesis in both cells was not required for immune cell adherence. Divalent cations, Ca 2 + or Mg 2 +, were required for this immune specific adherence to take place. However, once stable adherence was established, treatment with cytochalasin D, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, or sodium azide, or simple reduction of temperature, did not disrupt the binding. Interaction between immune interferon-producing cells and antigenic cells can be subdivided into two phases according to the requirement for divalent cations: (i) lymphocytes and antigenic cells interact transiently, and divalent cations are required to maintain the binding; (ii) lymphocytes and antigenic cells form a stable interaction, and deprivation of divalent cations does not disrupt the binding.
