60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, {{filled with}} delight and amusement.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{chair as}} {{two or three}} of the senior day-room {{collected}} round the Sportsman.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{chair and}} {{regarded}} with intense satisfaction the horrified {{faces of the}} group in front.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, and I in mine, and {{the absurd}} parody of our {{attitude}} strikes us both.|$|R
6000|$|Sherlock Holmes {{seemed to}} be embarrassed by the question. [...] "Frankly, now!" [...] she repeated, {{standing}} upon the rug and looking keenly down at him as <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a basket-chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "We've made {{a flying}} start and no mistake," [...] was Randy's comment, as <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the {{cushioned}} seat. [...] "Two days ago we {{never dreamed of}} going to Alaska or anywhere else." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair and, {{twisting}} the paper-knife idly between his fingers, watched his chief clerk closely.|$|E
60|$|She whispered {{something}} in Macheson's ear which he affected not to hear. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> cushioned seat and laughed.|$|E
60|$|Lord Chelsford {{referred}} to some {{notes in his}} hand. Then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, {{and looked at me}} steadfastly.|$|E
60|$|Now {{and then}} {{he turns to the}} camp-bed, and wetting his towel in the basin, presses it against his brow. Now <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, as if to give up; but again bends over and plods.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is great!" [...] exclaimed Alfred, as <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the bow facing her. [...] "There {{is nothing}} more to be desired. This {{beautiful}} clear stream, the air so fresh, the gold lined banks, the autumn leaves, a guide who--" ...|$|R
6000|$|MR. RICHARDS, unsympathetically: [...] "Nothing of {{the kind}} has happened. This car has simply come uncoupled, {{and the rest of}} the train has gone on ahead, and left us {{standing}} on the track, nowhere <b>in</b> particular." [...] <b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, and wheels it round from her.|$|R
60|$|He {{saw that}} she did not grasp all he meant to convey, and <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair with a laugh.|$|E
60|$|And, having handled a {{delicate}} matter in masterly fashion, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair and chewed the end off another cigar.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, {{one hand}} on the child's head, which he {{smoothed}} mechanically, and gesticulated with the other, speaking to Almayer.|$|E
60|$|Margaret {{saw that}} he was unusually agitated, and not by grief; applied herself to tea-making, and hoped his walk had given him an appetite; but there seemed little chance of this so long were his pauses between each morsel, and so often did <b>he</b> <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair.|$|R
60|$|Sir Leicester is {{generally}} in a complacent state, and rarely bored. When {{he has nothing}} else to do, he can always contemplate his own greatness. It is a considerable advantage to a man to have so inexhaustible a subject. After reading his letters, <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his corner of the carriage and generally reviews his importance to society.|$|R
60|$|Dunstable, apparently, {{was worried}} by no scruples. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> easily <b>in</b> his chair, and {{kept up a}} bright flow of conversation.|$|R
60|$|After {{glancing over}} it in a masterly way, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair and {{bestowed}} upon me {{an explosion of}} sardonic, superior, collegiate laughter.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair. There was a pained {{look in his}} face. She {{was almost}} sorry that she had {{mentioned}} his daughter's name.|$|E
60|$|Robert Vynerâ€™s face {{hardened}} {{again for}} a moment. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair and, playing with his watch-chain, regarded the other intently. Then he smiled maliciously.|$|E
6000|$|Newman {{shook her}} hand quietly and firmly. [...] "I'll come down there," [...] he said. The portiere dropped behind her, and Newman sank {{with a long}} breath into the nearest chair. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> it, resting {{his hands on the}} knobs of the arms and looking at Madame de Bellegarde and Urbain. There was a long silence. They stood side by side, with their heads high and their {{handsome}} eyebrows arched.|$|R
60|$|I said good-night {{to her at}} {{the foot}} of the stairs, and as I passed the open door to the cabin I glanced in. There sat Captain West, whom I had thought still on deck. His storm-trappings were removed, his sea-boots {{replaced}} by slippers; and <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the big leather chair, eyes wide open, beholding visions in the curling smoke of a cigar against a background of wildly reeling cabin wall.|$|R
60|$|Seven {{times that}} day Milt tried to lose him. Once he stopped without excuse, and merely {{stared up at}} rocks {{overhanging}} the hollowed road. Pinky was not embarrassed. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the seat and sang two Spanish love songs. Once Milt deliberately took a wrong road, up a mountainside. They were lost, and took five hours {{getting back to the}} highway. Pinky loved the thrill and--in a brief address lasting fifteen minutes--he said so.|$|R
60|$|They {{sat on his}} {{left-hand}} side, Phineas Duge {{pushed the}} decanter of Burgundy toward them, and the cigars. Then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair and waited.|$|E
60|$|Captain Griffiths {{appeared}} {{to receive the}} news with a certain undemonstrative satisfaction. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair with the air of one who is content to wait.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> padded chair, {{his hands}} folded {{in front of}} him, his cigar {{in the corner of}} his mouth. Arnold {{smoothed}} the paper out and read: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{begin to}} suspect that these {{youthful}} vagabonds, struggling for life, have received a perfect education,' thought the ever-musing Sidonia, as <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the landau, and watched the group {{that he had made}} so happy. 'A sublime religious principle sustains their souls; a tender morality regulates their lives; and with the heart and the spirit thus developed, they are brought up in the pursuit and production of the beautiful. It is the complete culture of philosophic dreams!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{had reason}} {{in what they}} told you," [...] Sogrange remarked, as <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a chair and sipped the coffee which {{had been waiting for}} him in the Baron de Grost's study. [...] "The train itself never got more than a mile away from the Gare du Nord. The engine-driver was shot through the head and the metals were torn from the way. Paris is within a year now of a second and more terrible revolution." ...|$|R
60|$|Horne Fisher and Harold March {{had their}} {{day on the}} river, after all, for the little group broke up when the police arrived. They {{declared}} that the coincidence of March's evidence had cleared the whole company, and clinched {{the case against the}} flying Hugo. Whether that Hungarian fugitive would ever be caught appeared to Horne Fisher to be highly doubtful; nor can it be pretended that he displayed any very demoniac detective energy in the matter as <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the boat cushions, smoking, and watching the swaying reeds slide past.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, {{surveying}} Billy blandly {{through his}} eye-glass. Billy's eyes were goggling. He looked from Psmith {{to the paper}} and from the paper to Psmith.|$|E
60|$|The letter which Mr. Ravenor {{had been}} writing {{to my mother}} was {{finished}} and sealed at last. Then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair and looked steadily at me.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Gaynsforth, {{although}} he was an Englishman and young, showed himself to be possessed {{of a sense of}} humor. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> seat and roared with laughter.|$|E
60|$|His father passed out, and Joe {{heard the}} front door close after him. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the big easy-chair and closed his eyes. A {{military}} school! He feared such an institution as the animal fears a trap. No, he would certainly never go to such a place. And as for public school--He sighed deeply {{at the thought of}} it. He was given till evening to make up his mind as to what he intended to do. Well, he knew what he would do, and {{he did not have to}} wait till evening to find it out.|$|R
60|$|While he {{gave the}} {{conductor}} his instructions a shrill whistle rang through {{the shadows of the}} pines and a big engine with a row of flat cars carrying a gravel plow and a crowd of dusty men came clattering down the line. As they rolled into the side-track Clay climbed to the platform of his car, and almost immediately the train started. His face grew hard and thoughtful when <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a corner seat; and he had emptied the cigar-case his friend had given him before he reached Vancouver, where he hired the fastest automobile he could find.|$|R
6000|$|... "Preserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it {{may prove}} to be of use to us. I begin to suspect that this matter {{may turn out to be}} much deeper and more subtle than I at first supposed. I must reconsider my ideas." [...] <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the cab, and I could see by his drawn brow and his vacant eye that he was {{thinking}} intently. Miss Morstan and I chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome, but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey.|$|R
