5|$|Brolgas {{are well}} known for their ritualised, {{intricate}} mating dances. The performance begins with a bird picking up some grass and tossing it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> before catching it in its bill. The bird then jumps a metre (yard) <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> with outstretched wings and continues by stretching its neck, bowing, strutting around, calling and bobbing its head up and down. Sometimes just one brolga dances for its mate; often they dance in pairs; and sometimes {{a whole group of}} about a dozen dance together, lining up roughly opposite each other before they start.|$|E
5|$|Like other pterosaurs, Pteranodon {{probably}} {{took off}} from a standing, quadrupedal position. Using their long forelimbs for leverage, they would have vaulted themselves <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> in a rapid leap. Almost all of the energy would have been generated by the forelimbs. The upstroke of the wings would have occurred when the animal cleared the ground followed by a rapid down-stroke to generate additional lift and complete the launch <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E

50|$|Although {{successfully}} introduced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Italian <b>Air</b> Force service, <b>the</b> P.148 {{was withdrawn}} from {{use with the}} introduction of an all-jet training programme. In 1970, the aircraft was re-introduced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Italian <b>Air</b> Force Service, when the basic piston-engine aircraft regained a role in the selection of pilots. Some aircraft were sold by <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force to <b>the</b> Somali <b>Air</b> Corps as trainers.|$|R
5|$|These {{moves are}} {{designed}} to be used in flurry combinations. For instance, the player can Seismic Slam an opponent, which pulls in enemies, and progress into a Rising Uppercut, which tosses the opponent <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> During that toss, the player can charge the Rocket Punch and release as the opponent returns to the ground. Alternatively, the player can launch <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> pick an opponent to slam, and punch them at close range. The character is built for aggressive playstyles and advanced players.|$|E
5|$|At {{the request}} of General Arnold, from 1934 to 1938, McClelland worked to devise a {{permanent}} airways communication system. In 1938, McClelland's efforts yielded {{the establishment of the}} Army Airways Communications System, a group that would develop <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Force Network Integration Center.|$|E
5|$|Both {{with respect}} to cost and speed, the China-Europe direct train service is in between the air and sea options.

5|$|Brașov and its surroundings, {{including}} the city's Black Church, were severely affected. According to local chronicles, {{in the village}} of Bod, more than 50 houses and several churches were damaged or destroyed.

5|$|Females of many spider species, {{including}} P. labiata, emit volatile pheromones <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> {{and these}} generally attract males from a distance. The silk draglines of female jumping spiders also contain pheromones, which stimulate males to court females and may give information about each female's status, for example whether the female is juvenile, subadult or mature.|$|E
5|$|On 16 October 1984, B-52G 57-6479, {{assigned}} to the 92d Bomb Wing, Fairchild AFB, Washington, clipped its wing on Hunts Mesa, an outcropping in Monument Valley, Arizona, and crashed, sending a fireball high <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Two of the seven crew perished in the crash, including Col. William Ivy, the wing's deputy commander for operations.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 2012, a {{controlled}} blast at 72nd Street caused rocks {{to fly over}} the station site. Nearly two weeks later, on August 21, 2012, an uncontrolled blast for the Second Avenue Subway station at 72nd Street was done incorrectly, causing a large explosion that sent debris <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and broke windows of buildings {{in the area and}} damaged nearby sidewalks.|$|E

5|$|Predators {{include the}} leopard, serval, cats, the black-headed heron, dark {{chanting}} goshawk, African hawk-eagle and Wahlberg's eagle. In South Africa, newly hatched chicks {{were taken by}} a boomslang. If surprised, an African crake will leap vertically <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> before running away, a tactic believed to help it to evade snakes or terrestrial mammals.|$|E
5|$|The Deccan Traps {{could have}} caused {{extinction}} through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulfuric aerosols <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions that increased the greenhouse effect when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{incomplete}} combustion {{of fossil}} fuels (such as diesel) and wood releases black carbon <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Though black carbon, most of which is soot, is an extremely small component of air pollution at land surface levels, the phenomenon has a significant heating effect on the atmosphere at altitudes above two kilometers (6,562ft). Also, it dims {{the surface of the}} ocean by absorbing solar radiation.|$|E

5|$|When {{the trigger}} was pulled, the spring pushed {{the firing pin}} {{forwards}} into the bomb, which ignited the propellant in the bomb and launched {{it out of the}} trough and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> The recoil caused by the detonation of the propellant then blew the firing pin backwards onto the spring; this automatically cocked the weapon for subsequent shots, eliminating the need to manually re-cock.|$|E
5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or scissors kick, is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> making a shearing movement with the lower limbs to get one leg {{in front of the}} other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E
5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the contaminated spray was thrown back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> as the base surge. Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological phenomenon in clean air, the base surge was a heavy fog bank of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.|$|E
