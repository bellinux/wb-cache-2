60|$|Now, {{from the}} South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and the Bashee Isles, between which lies {{one of the}} {{tropical}} outlets from the China waters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck found Ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him; and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the Japanese islands--Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke. With his snow-white new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table, and with a long pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man, {{with his back to}} the <b>gangway</b> <b>door,</b> was wrinkling his brow, and tracing his old courses again.|$|E
50|$|Sets 1012 and 1014 have end {{cars with}} a central <b>gangway</b> <b>door</b> instead of the offset {{emergency}} <b>gangway</b> <b>door</b> on other units. These two sets were originally built as four-car sets designed to operate in pairs on Toyoko Line through services.Cars 2 and 3 are each fitted with a single-arm pantograph.|$|E

50|$|From August 2011, all trains {{gradually}} received gangway refurbishments (similar refurbishments {{were also}} done in Class 311000 trains). Automatic doors were installed {{to replace the}} older, manually opened <b>gangway</b> <b>doors.</b> After refurbishment, <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> could be automatically opened by {{the push of a}} button.|$|R
50|$|Since August 2008, all trains were {{retrofitted}} {{with automatic}} <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> (similar retrofits were also done in Class 321000, 341000, and 351000 trains). This retrofit included {{the installation of}} automatic doors to replace the older doors that were manually pulled open; <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> can now be automatically opened by {{the push of a}} button. This retrofit process was completed by 2013.|$|R
50|$|The 789-1000 sets {{differ from}} the earlier Super Hakuchō sets in not having <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> beneath the driving cabs.|$|R

50|$|One single car was {{converted}} in February 1986 from former Iyo Railway 100 series car MoHa 106, purchased in October 1985. This car {{was built in}} 1950 by Teikoku Sharyo as KuHa 405, and converted to become single-car MoHa 106 with an additional driving cab in 1961. The second driving cab was subsequently taken out of use and a <b>gangway</b> <b>door</b> added, but from 1967, the driving cab was reinstated, with the <b>gangway</b> <b>door</b> left in place.|$|E
5000|$|Three EF67-0s {{were built}} from former 4th-batch Class EF60 {{locomotives}} from 1982 for use banking freight trains over 1,000 tonnes, {{for which the}} former EF61-200 banking locomotives were unsuitable. The No. 1 end was modified with a <b>gangway</b> <b>door</b> and access platform. The locomotives were painted in an all-over orange livery (officially [...] "Red No. 11") with yellow strips below the cab windows. These three locomotives are fitted with PS22D scissors-type pantographs.|$|E
50|$|From December 2015 {{until the}} end of fiscal 2017, the KiHa 261-1000 series fleet will {{gradually}} be repainted into a new livery with white front ends, yellow front-end <b>gangway</b> <b>doors,</b> and a purple bodyside stripe.|$|R
50|$|These {{cars were}} {{modified}} by JR Central from earlier KuMoHa 123-40 and KuMoHa 123-5040 series cars, {{for use on}} wanman driver only operation services on the Minobu Line. <b>Gangway</b> <b>doors</b> were also added on conversion.|$|R
50|$|Sets {{are formed}} as two-, eight-, and ten-car units, {{consisting}} of aluminium wide-bodied (2,930 mm) 20 m long four-door cars {{with no end}} <b>gangway</b> <b>doors.</b> Six-car sets were also scheduled to be built by fiscal 2011, but none was ultimately delivered.|$|R
50|$|The new, small cab is {{significantly}} {{smaller than the}} original Leyland cab and encroaches on the door vestibule area, providing cramped conditions for drivers and guards. Similar to other Sprinter units, such as Classes 150/2, 156 and 158, these units have <b>gangway</b> <b>door</b> connections at either end that allow passengers and staff to walk between units working in multiple. These units also {{have the benefit of}} passenger door control panels {{at either end of the}} cars.|$|E
5000|$|Four 800 series {{cars were}} built in 1958 as prototypes, based on the earlier 700 series design. The type was {{subsequently}} reclassified [...] "1000 series", with a further 352 vehicles built from 1959 to 1978. The early batches had non-gangwayed driving cabs with two windscreen panes, similar to the 700 series, but later batches included a centre <b>gangway</b> <b>door</b> at the cab ends. Sets built from 1971 onwards had air-conditioning from new, whereas earlier sets were subsequently retrofitted with air-conditioning.|$|E
50|$|Riding on this {{carriage}} costs {{twice that}} of a standard-class journey and passengers are required to buy the first class ticket (at the vending machine on East Rail line stations or ticket counters at the other stations) or second check their Octopus cards on the first class reader (located at the station platforms and beside the <b>gangway</b> <b>door</b> of the First class compartment itself) before entering the first-class car. Ticket Inspectors will perform random checks on train, and failing to produce a valid first class ticket or valiated Octopus Card will be liable to a surcharge of HK$500.|$|E
50|$|Seven 4+6-car {{trainsets}} (70 vehicles) {{were built}} between 1996 and 1999 to replace ageing Odakyu 3100 series NSE trains. Unlike earlier Romancecar trainsets, which used articulated carriages, the 30000 series sets have 20 m long bogie cars. The inner driving cabs of the 4+6-car formations have <b>gangway</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{sub-series}} {{was created}} by modifying 223-2000 series sets with performance restricted to match that of 221 series sets. The first 4-car set (V25) was returned to service on 21 January 2008. These sets are distinguished by an orange stripe on the front <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> between the headlight clusters.|$|R
5000|$|... 22 class ED76-500 {{locomotives}} {{were built}} from 1968 {{for use in}} Hokkaido, numbered ED76 501 to ED76 522. These locomotives included larger water and fuel tanks for the train heating steam generator and had accordingly longer bodies. They were intended {{to be used in}} pairs, and featured cab <b>gangway</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{two cars}} were {{converted}} in March 1988 by JR Central at Hamamatsu Works from former tractor cars KuMoYa 143-601 and 602, respectively, {{for use on}} the Minobu Line. These cars had <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> at the ends, three sliding doors per side, and two pantographs. Inverter-controlled air-conditioning was added in December 1988.|$|R
50|$|Batches of {{the class}} were built with {{significant}} design differences, due to changes in railway working practices. The first 125 locomotives, Nos. D200-D324, were built with steam-age 'disc' headcode markers, which BR used to identify services. Later, {{it was decided that}} locomotives should display the four character train reporting number (or headcode) of the service they were hauling, and Nos. D325-D344 were built with 'split' headcode boxes, which displayed two characters either side of the locomotive's central <b>gangway</b> <b>doors.</b> Another policy decision led to the discontinuing of the <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> (which enabled train crew to move between two or three locomotives in multiple). The remaining locomotives, Nos. D345-D399, carried a central four-character headcode box. In 1965, seven of the first batch of locomotives, Nos. D260-D266, which were based in Scotland, were converted to the central headcode design.|$|R
5000|$|From 1996, the EF64-0s {{underwent}} a life-extension refurbishment programme, with EF64 67 the first locomotive treated. Refurbishment {{was carried out}} at Omiya and Hiroshima Works, with locos initially released in the JR Freight livery of two-tone blue and light grey. Minor livery variations were implemented during the programme, and locos treated at Hiroshima were distinguished by having mustard-coloured cab <b>gangway</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The units {{incorporate}} {{a number of}} innovations, including a walk-in shop {{in place of the}} traditional buffet/restaurant car, and extensive passenger visual information systems {{on the inside of the}} car ends and on the outside of the doors. Following criticisms of the pressure- operated automatic <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> of the older Mark 3 and Mark 4 carriages (which could easily be held open by items of luggage resting on the floor sensor, allowing draughts into the passenger saloon) the <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> on the 390 sets are of the push-button [...] "open on demand" [...] type. All seats originally had an on-board entertainment system with a number of pre-recorded music channels. This feature was disabled in March 2010 to make way for new on-board WiFi provided by T-Mobile. Each seating row has a dot-matrix LCD display to indicate the reservation status of each seat, removing the need for conventional printed labels inserted manually by train crew.|$|R
50|$|It was {{reported}} that during the sinking 2nd Officer Lightoller ordered crew members to open the port side <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> on D-Deck for loading more passengers into the lifeboats nearer to sea level. The 1986 expedition confirmed {{that one of the}} port-side doors was wide open and the inner doors pulled back. This would have significantly increased the Titanic's flooding if the crew neglected to close doors.|$|R
50|$|The Titanic's vestibules {{differed}} from {{those on the}} Olympic - they were reduced in size to make the Reception Room larger and they eliminated the communicating corridor {{between the two sides}} in order to enlarge the elevator foyers. The Olympic vestibules contained Third-Class staircases that led down to E-Deck, which were eliminated on Titanic, and the elaborate wrought-iron grilles which covered the <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> were unique to Titanic.|$|R
50|$|Ancillaries such as {{electrical}} and air-conditioning systems were grouped together in discrete modules housed behind an aerodynamic skirting between the bogies; on the Mark 2 these were mounted {{above and below}} the passenger seating area. The lighting and air-conditioning fittings were for the first time integrated into the ceiling panels. Other new features were the pneumatically operated automatic <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> triggered by pressure pads under the floor. A speed-operated central door-locking system for the manually operated slam-doors was installed from 1993.|$|R
50|$|The third-batch build of locos (EF60 84 to 129 and EF60 512 to 514) had up-rated {{traction}} motors and differed slightly in having twin headlamps (like the EF65 and other later types) {{rather than the}} single large headlamp on earlier versions. Unlike the ED60s, these locos were designed to operate singly rather than in pairs, and so cab-end <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> were not included. The EF60-0s initially appeared in the standard all-over brown livery, but were repainted into blue from 1965 onward.|$|R
5000|$|The Titanic and Olympic both {{featured}} duplicate entrance vestibules {{on their}} {{port and starboard}} sides within the D-Deck Reception Rooms. There were sets of double <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> within the hull, screened by wrought-iron grilles. These were partially enclosed areas in the same white Georgian-style paneling; each vestibule contained a large sideboard for storing china. One set of French doors led into the Reception Room, {{but there was also}} a broad arched entryway leading to the elevators. Separate corridors led off of the vestibules to the First-Class staterooms in the forward part of D-Deck.|$|R
50|$|It {{was decided}} by BR and EE {{to carry out}} a {{programme}} to refurbish the class and modify the engines with new parts designed by the engine manufacturer. The locos also had modifications to their nose ends, losing the <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> and headcode discs in favour of a central roller blind headcode box. The livery also changed to two tone green with grey roof {{similar to that of the}} British Rail Class 55s so they looked every bit a 'Baby Deltic'. The locomotives gradually returned to traffic and became very reliable in traffic except for continuing coolant system problems.|$|R
50|$|The two end {{cars from}} the former eight-car set {{reformed}} from two four-car sets 1010 and 1011 were resold to the Iga Railway in 2009 after the set was withdrawn. The six intermediate cars of the set were scrapped. The two intermediate driving cars (with central <b>gangway</b> <b>doors)</b> originally formed in sets 1010 and 1011 before they were combined to become a single eight-car set were also sold to Iga Railway in 2010. Following its withdrawal in June 2009, eight-car set 1006 donated six cars, which were resold to Iga Railway between 2010 and 2012. The other two cars of the set were scrapped.|$|R
2500|$|The final Mark 2 {{carriage}} was departmental 999550, in 1977. [...] it {{is still}} in service with Network Rail as a Track Recording Coach. The later versions (2D onwards) look somewhat similar to the later Mark 3 design. The Mark 3 is longer (75 feet as opposed to 64 feet 6inches), has a large skirting between the bogies to conceal the ancillary equipment, and has a ridged roof {{as opposed to the}} smooth roof of the Mark 2. The development of the High Speed Train overlapped with that of the final production run, and the Mark 2F [...] "previewed" [...] many features incorporated into the Mark 3, such as new seating, plastic interior panelling, and floor-sensor-operated automatic <b>gangway</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 485 series trains were {{introduced}} in 1968. These trains were capable of operating under 1,500 V DC or 20 kV AC (50/60 Hz) overhead wire power supplies. The original design was closely based on the bonnet-style 181 series EMU, with the primary difference being ceilings that were 12.5 cm higher. However, trains produced from 1972 onwards, starting with the 485-200 series, featured a new design with a cab adapted from the 583 series sleeper expresses, which became the standard on nearly all subsequent JNR limited-express EMUs. The 485-200 series trains had <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> at the cab ends to allow trains to be operated in multiple, but the 485-300 series trains introduced from 1974 had no gangways. The 485-1500 series trains were built in 1974 for use in Hokkaido. The 485-1000 series trains built from 1975 onward incorporated design improvements from the DC-only 183-1000 series trains.|$|R
500|$|At 00:45, {{lifeboat}} No. 7 was rowed {{away from}} Titanic with 28passengers on board (despite {{a capacity of}} 65). Lifeboat No. 6, on the port side, was the next to be lowered at 00:55. It also had 28 people on board, among them the [...] "unsinkable" [...] Margaret [...] "Molly" [...] Brown. Lightoller realised {{there was only one}} seaman on board (Quartermaster Robert Hichens) and called for volunteers. Major Arthur Godfrey Peuchen of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club stepped forward and climbed down a rope into the lifeboat; he was the only male passenger whom Lightoller allowed to board during the port side evacuation. Peuchen's role highlighted a key problem during the evacuation: there were hardly any seamen to man the boats. Some had been sent below to open <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> to allow more passengers to be evacuated, but they never returned. They were presumably trapped and drowned by the rising water below decks.|$|R
50|$|The train {{has been}} {{designed}} to be lighter and more efficient, with increased reliability. It will have lightweight all-welded bodies, wide <b>gangways</b> and <b>doors</b> to shorten boarding times in stations, and ERTMS. The design incorporates FlexxEco bogies which have been used in service on Voyagers and newer Turbostars. The gangway is designed to allow maximum use of the interior space and ease of movement throughout the train.|$|R
50|$|Like the MTR Metro Cammell EMUs (Modernization Train), KCR Metro Cammell EMUs have {{undergone}} major refurbishment from 1996 to 1999 {{to extend their}} lifespan, {{carried out by the}} successor of Metro-Cammell, Alstom. The trains were converted to fixed 12-car sets and received a new exterior livery of blue bodies and red doors. Interior refurbishments included the replacement of transverse seating by longitudinal bench seats to create more space for standing passengers (although transverse seating was retained in First Class) and the addition of two doors to each side of every compartment (excluding First Class). The freight compartment between the driving cab and First Class compartment was removed along with its doors, together with intermediate driving compartments, toilets, and <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> excluding First Class. The trains also received new passenger information systems, including multi-colour LED signs displaying train destination, the next station, safety guidelines, and the time and temperature. They also have 22-inch LCD screens mounted above windows, broadcasting looping daily TV news provided by Cable TV Hong Kong (Newsline Express) and advertisements.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of the Titanics {{collision}} with the iceberg, Pitman was off-duty, half-sleeping in his bunk in the Officers' Quarters. He heard and felt the collision, later testifying that it felt like the ship [...] "coming to an anchor." [...] He was dressing for his watch when Fourth Officer Boxhall rushed in and informed him they had struck an iceberg and were taking on water. Pitman was then ordered to report to the starboard side of the ship to assist in uncovering lifeboats. After receiving the command to lower the boats, Murdoch ordered Pitman to take charge of lifeboat No. 5. Before Pitman entered the lifeboat, Officer Murdoch shook his hand saying, [...] "Goodbye; good luck." [...] Even then, Pitman did not himself believe that the Titanic was really going to sink. Pitman stepped into the lifeboat and it was lowered to the water. Murdoch had ordered Pitman to take the lightly loaded lifeboat to the <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> to take on more passengers, but Pitman later testified that the doors were not opened as the boat waited about 100 yards away.|$|R
2500|$|Prism Rail was {{purchased}} by National Express in September 2000, and the franchise was rebranded as c2c once the Class 357/0 units were in service. The second batch of 28 Class 357/2 units were ordered {{at a cost of}} £92 million by c2c in 2000 primarily to replace the remaining Class 312 units. Construction started in 2001, and they were delivered between September 2001 and May 2002. They are owned by Angel Trains and leased by c2c, at an initial cost of £900 a day (including rental and maintenance). Due to the rebranding, they have a white livery with grey doors, and are internally branded to the c2c purple colour scheme with magenta handrails, magenta stickers on the inter-carriage <b>gangway</b> <b>doors</b> with c2c branding: [...] "culture2club2commuters2culture2club2", and a light grey linoleum floor with white, dark grey and light purple flecks. The [...] "door out of order" [...] display is above the door close button, which is above the door open button, unlike in the 357/0 units. These units were fitted with DVA with the voice of Julie Berry. See 1973 tube stock for info on her announcement career.|$|R
