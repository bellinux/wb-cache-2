5|$|There are 25 {{main routes}} {{to the summit}} with {{alternates}} of those main routes. They range in difficulty from the relatively easy non-technical South Spur (South Climb) route to the extremely challenging and dangerous Victory Ridge, Rusk Glacier <b>Headwall,</b> and Wilson Glacier <b>Headwall</b> routes up Roosevelt Cliff.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{the hollow}} took {{the shape of}} a large bowl {{in the side of the}} mountain, with the <b>headwall</b> being {{weathered}} by constant freezing and thawing, and eroded by plucking. The basin became deeper (especially at the base of the <b>headwall)</b> as it continued to be eroded by abrasion.|$|E
5|$|Mount Washington is {{a common}} objective, and is often climbed from Pinkham Notch. There are {{numerous}} trail approaches from the Appalachian Mountain Club's visitor's center. Although trail distances seem short, {{the trip to the}} summit should not be underestimated; most trail approaches involve at least 4,000 vertical feet (1,200m) of climbing, including an ascent of the rocky summit cone and the boulder-strewn upper slopes. Weather changes very quickly, and one must be prepared for extreme conditions. The Tuckerman Ravine Trail is the most popular trail in the notch, ascending to the summit via the <b>headwall</b> of Tuckerman Ravine. The Huntington Ravine Trail is widely considered the most difficult trail in New Hampshire, making its way up the precipitous <b>headwall</b> of neighboring Huntington Ravine, where there are several rock climbing opportunities.|$|E

40|$|Many bedrock canyons on Earth and Mars were {{eroded by}} {{upstream}} propagating <b>headwalls,</b> and a prominent goal in geomorphology and planetary science {{is to determine}} formation processes from canyon morphology. A diagnostic link between process and form remains highly controversial, however, and field investigations that isolate controls on canyon morphology are needed. Here we investigate the origin of Malad Gorge, Idaho, a canyon system cut into basalt with three remarkably distinct heads: two with amphitheater <b>headwalls</b> and the third housing the active Wood River and ending in a 7 % grade knickzone. Scoured rims of the <b>headwalls,</b> relict plunge pools, sediment-transport constraints, and cosmogenic (^ 3 He) exposure ages indicate formation of the amphitheater-headed canyons by large-scale flooding ∼ 46 ka, coeval with formation of Box Canyon 18 km to the south {{as well as the}} eruption of McKinney Butte Basalt, suggesting widespread canyon formation following lava-flow diversion of the paleo-Wood River. Exposure ages within the knickzone-headed canyon indicate progressive upstream younging of strath terraces and a knickzone propagation rate of 2. 5 cm/y over at least the past 33 ka. Results point to a potential diagnostic link between vertical amphitheater <b>headwalls</b> in basalt and rapid erosion during megaflooding due to the onset of block toppling, rather than previous interpretations of seepage erosion, with implications for quantifying the early hydrosphere of Mars...|$|R
5|$|Helvellyn is {{a popular}} area for winter {{climbing}} in the Lake District. The steep <b>headwall</b> above Red Tarn contains several graded routes, clustered around the prow-shaped buttress {{on the right-hand side}} of the face, known to climbers as Viking Buttress, and in a couple of gullies which lead to the summit.|$|E
5|$|The volcano stayed {{active well}} into the {{formation}} of these mountainside valleys, as illustrated by later Pololu lava flows, which covered the north and northwestern end of Kohala volcano and often flowed into Pololu Valley. Recent seafloor mapping seems {{to show that the}} valley extends a short way beyond the seashore, then terminates at what may be the <b>headwall</b> of the great landslide found off the northeast coast of Kohala.|$|E
5|$|The cirque where Castle Lake {{is found}} {{is a classic}} Northern Hemisphere cirque. The cirque <b>headwall</b> (the highest part of the {{mountain}} where the glacier began to form) was in the south or southwest, and {{the part of the}} mountain that sloped downward to the northeast was away from the prevailing winds. The resulting shaded area was sheltered from direct sun, and from the evaporating effects of wind. These conditions encouraged snow which had fallen in the winter to remain throughout the summer and fall, creating a year-round snow pack which grew deeper each year.|$|E
50|$|White spruce {{or white}} × Engelmann hybrids are found only rarely within the Ponderosa Pine (PP) zone, and occur in cool, moist, {{sheltered}} situations, e.g., steep, north-facing canyon <b>headwalls</b> (Coates et al. 1994).|$|R
50|$|Evidence of the Civilian Conservation Corps' park {{improvements}} can be seen, including stone-work on <b>headwalls,</b> {{barriers and}} pavilions. Their {{work on the}} park was responsible for six buildings and the reclamation of swampland on the eastern end.|$|R
40|$|Integrated {{interpretation}} of multi-beam bathymetric, sediment-penetrating acoustic (PARASOUND) and seismic data show a multiple slope failure {{on the northern}} European continental margin, north of Spitsbergen. The first slide event occurred during MIS 3 around 30 cal. ka BP and was characterised by highly dynamic and rapid evacuation of ca. 1250 km 3 of sediment from the lower to {{the upper part of}} the continental slope. During this event, <b>headwalls</b> up to 1600 m high were created and ca. 1150 km 3 material from hemi-pelagic sediments and from the lower pre-existing trough mouth fan has been entrained and transported into the semi-enclosed Sophia Basin. This megaslide event was followed by a secondary evacuation of material to the Nansen Basin by funnelling of the debris through the channel between Polarstern Seamount and the adjacent continental slope. The main slide debris is overlain by a set of fining-upward sequences as evidence for the associated suspension cloud and following minor failure events. Subsequent adjustment of the eastern <b>headwalls</b> led to failure of rather soft sediments and creation of smaller debris flows that followed the main slide surficial topography. Discharge of the Hinlopen ice stream during the Last Glacial Maximum and the following deglaciation draped the central <b>headwalls</b> and created a fan deposit of glacigenic debris flows...|$|R

25|$|All three Buttermere Fells {{throw out}} a rocky spur toward the lake, these walls {{enclosing}} Birkness and Bleaberry Combs. Birkness Comb, also called Burtness Comb on Ordnance Survey maps, lies between the truncated and unnamed northern ridges of High Crag and High Stile. Drained into Buttermere by Comb Beck, its <b>headwall</b> is rimmed by crags on all sides. Sheepbone Buttress flanks High Crag, {{which also has}} a share in Comb Crags, lining the onward ridge. It is the great scooped hollow of the Comb which results in the narrowness of Buttermere Edge.

40|$|New {{geophysical}} acquired during cruise M 78 with RV “Meteor” in 2009 {{reveal a}} large-scale slope failure complex. Positioned between 1800 and 3300 m water depth, the slope failure affected {{an area of}} at least 1200 km 2. The failure is hosted in contouritic deposits. The morphology of the up 70 m high <b>headwalls</b> is underlain by a deeper reflector which we interpret as detachment. Listric faults positioned upslope these <b>headwalls</b> root in this detachment and are precursor of future failure at this location. The detachment correlates with a regional BSR mapped by Uruguayan colleagues. Cores recovered from 3 transects across the failure complex confirm that the acoustic transparent units are debrites. Sedimentological evidence in accordance with hydro-acoustic data indicate that debrites deposited downslope this failure complex are recent features on the slope...|$|R

25|$|Ben Oss is {{especially}} craggy on its northern face, falling away steeply to the Cononish valley and barring any direct approach from this direction. It has two main ridges which {{connect to the}} adjacent Munros of Ben Lui and Beinn Dubhchraig and walkers usually arrive at the mountains summit along either of these. One ridge goes north east, east and then south east to form a curving edge around Coire Garbh connecting to Beinn Dubhchraig at the Bealach Buidhe with a height of 779 metres. Coire Garbh has Loch Oss lying within its recesses, {{a body of water}} measuring roughly 500 by 300 metres. Coire Buidhe stands on the northern side of this eastern ridge, this has a steep <b>headwall</b> and descents north from the bealach to the Cononish valley are not recommended.|$|E
25|$|On the east, {{the first}} {{impression}} is all of rock. The long strath of Grisedale runs north-eastward to Ullswater, cutting off a series of hanging valleys which fall from the Helvellyn range. To the north-east of Dollywaggon Pike, below the summit of High Crag, is Ruthwaite Cove, a corrie surrounded on three sides by crag. Ruthwaite Cove is now the site of Ruthwaite Lodge, a climbing hut. It was formerly the setting for more industrious activity, with the remains of several levels and some shallow open mineworking being visible near the Lodge. These excavations were made for lead-bearing galena, and {{are believed to have}} been worked in the sixteenth century. Further leases were taken out in 1784 and 1862, the last-known operation being in 1880. To the east of Dollywaggon Pike is a second corrie, Cock Cove, with Falcon Crag and the deeply gullied Tarn Crag providing the impressive <b>headwall.</b>|$|E
25|$|As the radial {{point of}} so many ridges Scoat Fell forms the head of several valleys, the major ones being the Wasdale feeders of Mosedale and Nether Beck. Mosedale begins on the eastern flanks of Scoat Fell, between Red Pike and Pillar, {{in the hollow of}} Black Comb. There are crags in the <b>headwall,</b> {{particularly}} to the south. Nether Beck has its birth at Scoat Tarn, a large pool to the south of the fell. This corrie tarn, held in place by grassy moraines is around 65ft deep. Between Steeple and Pillar to the north is Windgap Cove with Black Crag, a Hewitt at its head. Wind Gap is the col between Black Crag and Pillar, while the small Mirk Cove lies between Black Crag and the summit. Finally Mirklin Cove is the corrie between Steeple and Tewit How, drained into Ennerdale by Low Beck. All of the northern coves are home to impressive crags.|$|E
50|$|Shanzidou {{has been}} climbed only once, on May 8, 1987, by an American expedition. The summit team {{comprised}} Phil Peralta-Ramos and Eric Perlman.

They rated the maximum technical {{difficulty of the}} rock at YDS 5.7.|$|R
40|$|High-resolution multibeam {{bathymetry}} {{is used as}} {{basis for}} detecting instability processes on the Tyrrhenian margin offshore Calabria (Italy). Among the many evidence at different spatial scale, we focus on selected cases that may represent a potential geohazard because of their scale, shallow/proximal location and state of activity. These include failures along coastal cliffs and canyon <b>headwalls</b> indenting narrow shelves. Coastal rocky failures impacting shallow water offshore Scilla and Palmi retain significant tsunamigenic potential, as proved by the 1783 Scilla event. Slide scars at canyon <b>headwalls</b> offshore Bagnara Calabra and Gioia Tauro indicate retrogressive failure active at water depth < 10 m, just few hundreds of meters from the coast and the settlements and infrastructures there present. Geohazard related to these features is therefore relevant as testified by the failure induced during construction of the Gioia Tauro harbour in 1977...|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{has several}} {{ornamental}} features that {{distinguish it from}} an ordinary highway bridge. The <b>headwalls</b> and railings are faced with roughly-cut granite rubble in various colors of gray, pink, and tan. The <b>headwalls</b> continue above the roadway to form the railings, which have narrow lancet-like openings that evoke a late Gothic Revival design. While the bridge resembles Federal Relief projects of the 1930s, it was not actually built by a Federal Relief organization such as the Works Progress Administration or the Civilian Conservation Corps. Instead, it was designed by the Minnesota Department of Highways (now the Minnesota Department of Transportation), probably with their chief landscape architect Arthur R. Nichols. It resembles the National Park Service Rustic style popular in Federal Relief architecture, and the excellent stonework is typical of that used in the labor-intensive construction projects of that era.|$|R

500|$|The bulk of {{the western}} slope of the notch is formed by Mount Washington, the highest peak in the {{northeast}} United States, reaching [...] above sea level. Mount Washington rises more than [...] above {{the floor of the}} notch. A number of glacial cirques are found {{on this side of the}} notch. The Great Gulf and its tributary cirques form the largest cirque in the White Mountains. South of the Great Gulf is Huntington Ravine, with a rocky, precipitous <b>headwall</b> renowned for its rock and ice climbing. The slope then dips into the Ravine of Raymond Cataract, a non-glacial [...] "V-shaped" [...] valley with a notable waterfall. After this comes Tuckerman Ravine, with a uniform, smoother <b>headwall</b> that is known for its high-quality skiing. After passing the Gulf of Slides, a smaller and lesser-known cirque, the notch opens up and continues until Jackson.|$|E
50|$|The glacier covers {{most of the}} <b>headwalls</b> {{encircling}} the valley, {{except the}} eastern side where the bordering peaks are all just below 2000 m.

50|$|The {{first step}} {{involves}} {{looking for a}} suitable location to glacier growing. The preferred terrain, according to glacier growers in Baltistan and Gilgit, is in shadowed scree-slopes overlooked by steep <b>headwalls.</b> Commonly the sites are located between 4,000-5,000 metres above sea level. Such locations are susceptible to snowfall and avalanches during winter and spring, creating an environment conducive to the accumulation of ice.|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{abundance}} in alpine terrain of glacially dissected landscapes, {{the magnitude and}} geometry of glacial erosion can rarely be defined. In the eastern Kyrgyz Range, a widespread unconformity exhumed as a geomorphic surface provides a regional datum with which to calibrate erosion. As tectonically driven surface uplift has progressively pushed this surface into the zone of ice accumulation, glacial erosion has overprinted the landscape. With as little as 500 m of incision into rocks underlying the unconformity, distinctive glacial valleys display their deepest incision adjacent to cirque <b>headwalls.</b> The expansion of north-facing glacial cirques {{at the expense of}} south-facing valleys has driven the drainage divide southwards at rates up to 2 to 3 times the rate of valley incision. Existing ice-flux-based glacial erosion rules incompletely model expansion of glacial valleys via cirque retreat into the low-gradient unconformity remnants. Local processes that either directly sap cirque <b>headwalls</b> or inhibit erosion down-glacier appear to control, at least initially, alpine landscape evolution...|$|R
