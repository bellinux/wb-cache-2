25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{underground}} dams: a sub-surface and a sand-storage dam. A sub-surface dam is built across an aquifer or drainage route from an impervious layer (such as solid bedrock) up to just below the surface. They can be constructed of a variety of materials to include bricks, stones, concrete, steel or PVC. Once built, the water stored behind the dam raises the water table and is then extracted with wells. A sand-storage dam is a weir built in stages across a stream or wadi. It must be strong, as floods will wash over its crest. Over time, sand accumulates in layers behind the dam, which helps store water and, most importantly, prevent evaporation. The stored water can be extracted with a well, through the <b>dam</b> <b>body,</b> or by means of a drain pipe.|$|E

Dams are mainly divided into four parts {{on the basis of}} the type and materials of construction as gravity dams, buttress dams, arch dams, and embankment dams. There are two types of embankment dams: earthfill dams and rockfill dams. In this study, seepage through an earthfill <b>dam's</b> <b>body</b> is investigated using an artificial neural network model. Seepage is investigated since seepage both in the <b>dam's</b> <b>body</b> and under the foundation adversely affects dam's stability. This study specifically investigated seepage in <b>dam.</b> s <b>body.</b> The seepage in the <b>dams</b> <b>body</b> follows a phreatic line. In order to understand the degree of seepage, it is necessary to measure the level of phreatic line. This measurement is called as piezometric measurement. Piezometric data sets which are collected from Jeziorsko earthfill dam in Poland were used for training and testing the developed ANN model. Jeziorsko dam is a non-homogeneous earthfill dam built on the impervious foundation. Artificial Neural Networks are one of the artificial intelligence related technologies and have many properties. In this study the water levels on the upstream and downstream sides of the dam were input variables and the water levels in the piezometers were the target outputs in the artificial neural network model. In the line of the purpose of this research, the locus of the seepage path in an earthfill dam is estimated by artificial neural networks. MATLAB 6 neural network toolbox is used for this study.

30|$|Temperature {{variation}} {{is one of}} main safety monitoring items during the operation of concrete dams. A scientific and reasonable early-warning index (Wu 2003) of the <b>dam</b> <b>body’s</b> temperature has important significance in accurate hazard recognition and dam security protection. Temperature control is a key factor influencing whether the temperature cracks occur or not. In the process of operation, improper temperature control (Zhu 2014) will lead to dam cracking and even endanger the safety of <b>dam</b> <b>bodies.</b> Generally, the concrete dams belong to the mass concrete structure which has bad temperature conductivity, and they are often exposed to the outside, contacting with water, air and so on. All kinds of factors like temperature change outside, cement hydration heat and constraint stress may produce tensile stress. With the limit ability of concrete tensile strength, cracks tend {{to appear in the}} mass concrete structure. Combined with long-acting service characteristics of the concrete dams, advanced mechanical and mathematical theories are employed to scientifical theory for early-warning, as well as to conduct timely and effective determination of the safety status of dams. These activities are critical to perform safe operations and determine crucial topics in dam safety monitoring field research.|$|R

However, this method cannot be used in dense sand layers and stones/cobblestones layers. An in-situ ground investigation machine, NSWS (Nippon Screw Weight System) that enables identification of super soft zones and has the functions for controlling hydraulics and pneumatics of loading, and for segmentation of measuring interval was developed by utilizing the measuring system (using load and rotational penetration resistance) of the SWS test machine.

Specifically, the NSWS test (machine) was used for cobble-mixed gravel layers in the initial investigation stage with the purposes of identifying the area loosened due to ground subsidence and assessing its impact to the <b>dam's</b> <b>body.</b> In addition to the measurement results of the amount of load, the penetration rate and the number of rotations, the area loosened due to ground subsidence was identified by paying attention to the scuttle frequency considering subsidence frequency specific to a NSWS test (machine) as a parameter.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the present thesis are a) {{the study of the}} behaviour of earth <b>dams</b> <b>bodies</b> under static loads charging and b) the standardization of a simulation procedure by the use of the finite element method. The data are coming from the body of the earth dam of the power plan of Sfikia. Those data concerns: a) the details of the <b>dam's</b> <b>body,</b> b) the instruments network, c) the recordings of the laboratory tests and d) the recordings of the instruments. The materials of the core were subjected to several tests. Using the data coming from 275 undistributed samples we defined the constitutive law and the mechanical parameters that reproduce the stress - strain relationship of those materials. The materials of the filter zones and the materials of the supporting zones were subjected to special laboratory tests that were carried out on very large disturbed samples. Using the data coming from those tests we determined with accuracy the mechanical properties of the zones. We also managed to define the constitutive laws of the materials. The accurate calculation of the mechanical properties and the constitutive laws combined with the calculating power of the finite element method code designed by PLAXIS BV gave us the capability to standardize a simulation procedure. In order to improve that procedure we use the readings coming from the instruments that they are permanently instituted into the dam. By the use of parametrical analyses we determined the influence of the values of Poisson ratio and of the core' s constitutive law on the results of the simulation procedure. ...|$|R
