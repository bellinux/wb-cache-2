In a wired network, especially in a backbone network, many links are actually “bundles ” of multiple physical cables and line cards that can be shut down independently. In this paper, we study the following routing problem for green networking in wired networks: Given a set of end-to-end communication sessions, determine how to route data traffic through the network such that total power consumption is minimized by turning off unused cables in bundled links and nodes, subject to the constraint that the traffic demand of each session is satisfied. We present an integer linear programming to provide optimal solutions. We also present two fast and effective heuristic algorithms {{to solve the problem}} in polynomial time. It has been shown by simulation results based on the Abilene network and the NSF network that the proposed heuristic algorithms consistently provide close-to-optimal solutions.

In this thesis, we apply the tool of statistical physics to two different problems. In the first problem, we examine a multi-agent system in which epochs of alternating winning groups are being generated by the self-segregation of agents. To study the lifetime distribution of epochs, we set up theoretical approaches which have an excellent agreement with simulation results up to 8 decades of probability in the lifetime distribution. We find evidence showing that epochs are stabilized by intelligent agents aggregating in the winning groups. In the second problem, we investigate resource allocation problems in random networks with finite bandwidths. Algorithms to find optimal solutions are obtained by the chemical potential approach and the message passing approach. A decrease in the bandwidth of links surprisingly leads to an increase of <b>idle</b> <b>links.</b> Both theoretical analyses and simulations show that an increase of connectivity leads to a more homogeneous redistribution of resources, even with vanishing bandwidths of the links...|$|R

Much of this energy powers <b>idle</b> <b>links,</b> switches, and network-connected hosts and is thus wasted. This dissertation contains the first-ever investigation into the energy efficiency of Ethernet networks. A method for matching Ethernet link data rate with link utilization, called Adaptive Link Rate (ALR), is designed and evaluated. ALR consists of a mechanism to change the link data rate and a policy to determine when to change the data rate. The focus of this dissertation is on the analysis and simulation evaluation of two ALR policies. The simplest ALR policy uses output buffer thresholds to determine when to change data rate. This policy is modeled using a Markov chain. A specific challenge was modeling a state-dependent service rate queue with rate transition only at service completion. This policy was shown to be unstable in some cases, and an improved policy based on explicit utilization measurement was investigated. This more complex policy was evaluated using simulation. A synthetic traffic generator was developed to create realistic synthetic network traffic traces for the simulation evaluation. Finally, an improved method for detecting long idle periods using quantile estimation was investigated. Characterization of network traffic showed that proxying by a low power device for a high power device is feasible. A prototype proxy for a Web server was developed and studied.

Current, anycast research does not explicitly consider the system load of nodes within an anycast groups when distributing requests. Therefore, the performance of a heavily loaded anycast system can quickly become congested and uneven as jobs are routed to closely linked nodes which are already saturated with requests.

40|$|This {{project is}} {{concerned}} with the estimation of the grade of service given to the subscribers in a telephone exchange. The analytical models used are (a) the probability linear graph for lost calls and (b) the traffic flow graph for delayed calls. Both of these models are expressed in terms of the congestion functions of the sub-units of the switching system in the exchange. When these models are used, the engineering procedure of determining the quantity of equipment for the switching system in the exchange to satisfy the objective grade of service is simple. The switching system in the exchange may be divided into three major sub-units: the trunk groups, the switching network, and the common control. The congestion functions for these sub-units are discussed. The structure and the mode of operation for these sub-units are usually very complex, so that the congestion functions for these units can only be approximated. Thus, the overall grade of service estimated this way is only an approximation. Finally, the procedure of estimating the overall grade of service of an exchange is demonstrated by considering a simple hypothetical telephone switching system. The main contributions in this thesis are: (1) The traffic flow graph: This graph is used as the model for estimating the grade of service for delayed calls in an exchange. It can also be used for approximating the waiting time distribution for a given waiting system. (2) The equivalent trunk technique: This technique is shown to be reasonably accurate and simple for use in computing the trunk group congestion distribution when the trunk group is arranged in grading. (3) A method of approximating network blocking probability: This method can be used to approximate the blocking probability of any complex switching network. It is simple and inexpensive and produces reasonably accurate results. (4) Single linking stage network loaded with multitype of traffic: When some types of traffic require the service of more than one link at a time, the network for these types of traffic is blocked even if there are some <b>idle</b> <b>links</b> in the network. Extremely poor approximation will result if the usual assumption of independent busy links is used for calculating the blocking probability. In this thesis, such a network is analysed and a better approximation for computing the blocking probability is given.

These multicomputer systems employ a wide range of policies for routing, switching, arbitration, queueing, and flow control, implemented in the router hardware that connects an individual processing node to the interconnection fabric and manages traffic flowing through the node en route to other destinations. To address the requirements of emerging applications, we develop new techniques for designing and evaluating new router architectures that tailor network policies to application characteristics. These results facilitate the development of effective support for communication in real-time systems and local area networks, as well as more traditional multicomputer domains like high-speed scientific computing.

Analytical modeling is used to gain a deeper general insight into packet coalescing. The architecture of a hybrid web server based on two platforms - a low-power (ARM based) and a high-power (Pentium based) - can be used to achieve step-wise energy-proportional operation and maintain headroom for peak loads. A new method based on Gratuitous ARP for switching between two mirrored platforms is developed, prototyped, and evaluated. Experimental results show that for up to 50 requests per minute, a hybrid server where the Master platform is a 2012 server-grade desktop PC can sleep for 50 % of time with no increase in response time. HTTP can be used for redirection in space - a new method for precise redirection in time is proposed and used to schedule requests to a high-power server in a hybrid server. The scheduling method is modeled as a single server queue with vacations where the vacation duration is fixed and the service distribution is directly a function of the request load. This approach is well suited for delay tolerant applications such as application updates and file back-up. Energy-proportional operation is shown to be achievable in a prototype system. A first-order estimation with conservative assumptions on the adoption rate of the methods proposed and studied here shows that these methods can collectively enable energy savings in the order of hundreds of million dollars in the US annually...|$|R
