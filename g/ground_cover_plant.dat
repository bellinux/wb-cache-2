40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to determine the}} best chemical weed control method for us in establishing new plantings of <b>ground</b> <b>covers.</b> Varying levels of herbicides, different mulches, and activated carbon as a protectant were tested at Newark, Delaware during 1969 and 1970. The experimental design was a split plot, and was replicated three times. The <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> <b>plants</b> studied were Aiuga reptans, Hedera helix, Pachysandra terminalis, and Vinca minor. Herbicides studied were simazine (4 lbs. /A), dichlobenil (6 lbs. /A), diphenamid (6 lbs. /A), simazine (2 lbs. /A) combined with diphenamid (4 lbs. /A), and dichlobenil (4 lbs. /A) combined with diphenamid (4 lbs. /A). Mulches studied were licorice root (on-inch depth) and “FoliCote” (diluted in ater at a ratio of one to five). On half of all plant material was root-dipped in activated carbon. Herbicide toxicity to the <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> was rated by a standard visual evaluation on a scale from one to five. Weed infestation was determined as stand (number of plants) and vigor (dry weight in grams). Growth of <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> <b>plants</b> was measured by using a grid, and the percentage of <b>ground</b> <b>covered</b> by the <b>plants</b> within this grid was estimated. The stand (number of plants) and the vigor (fresh weight in grams) of the <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> <b>plants</b> was also determined. With no mulch, weed control studies indicated that dry weight production of Panicum dichotomiflorum (fall panicum) was significantly reduced by the simazine-diphenamid and the dichlobenil-diphenamid herbiced treatments. Also with no mulch, the stand and vigor of Portulaca oleracea (purslane) was significantly reduced by simazine (4 lbs. /A), diphenamid (6 lbs. /A), and the simazine-diphenamid combination. The no mulch-herbicide treatments were not effective in controlling Eragrostis cilianesis (stinkgrass) and Amaranthus retroflexus (redroot pigweed). However, studies indicated that weed control of all weed species was significantly improved when licorice root mulch was applied to a one-inch depth over all herbicide treatments. Herbicide injury studies indicated that activated carbon did detoxify all herbicides tested. Plants root-dipped in activated carbon showed less herbicide injury, greater fresh weight, and more growth (percentage of <b>ground</b> <b>covered)</b> than those <b>plants</b> that were not so treated...|$|R

In this study multitemporal spectral information of sugarcane obtained during the crop year 1982 - 1983 were correlated with cane production and the efficiency of using LANDSAT spectral data for yield estimation was evaluated. Sun elevations of the eight LANDSAT data dates were corrected to 44 degrees and the digital counts of the 24 sugarcane fields were acquired using INPE's interactive image analysis system for each MSS channel. Correlation analyses were applied to cane yields and vegetation indices (i. e., D 57, R 75, TVI and PVI) that were derived from single or multidate LANDSAT spectral data. Significant correlation coefficients were found, however, the amplitudes of the coefficients were not high enough for a direct application on sugarcane yield estimation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is {{reported}} from diseased plants of Tradescantia fluminensis. The fungus was isolated from necrotic leaf lesions on observed plants that were infesting parkland near Auckland, New Zealand. Subsequent reinoculation of S. sclerotiorum onto leaf and stem tissue satisfied Koch’s postulates that T. fluminensis is {{a host of}} this isolate. Tradescantia fluminensis Vell. (Commelinaceae), known as wandering jew and now commonly referred to by its genus name alone, is a ground-smothering perennial herb native to South America. In 1910, it was introduced to New Zealand by a Manawatu farmer as a <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> <b>plant</b> to prevent soil erosion.

40|$|Aspects of the {{establishment}} and use of ground cover plants for urban weed control were investigated. Established ground cover populations of different taxa were monitored over 1 year at 14 sites {{for their ability to}} block light from the soil and prevent weeds from establishing. Field trials compared 12 ground cover species of widely differing growth form for rate of establishment and ability to block light and suppress weeds. Another field trial compared various types of mulch with selective herbicides and hand weeding as techniques for establishing ground cover species. No single growth form was superior to others, and it was the density of the foliage that was key to suppressing weeds. Ground cover plants should be selected for having persistently dense canopies throughout the year, such as Coprosma acerosa ‘Taiko’ and Juniperus procumbens. Deciduous species like Persicaria capitata, evergreen species which become sparser in winter like Pimelea prostrata, and plant canopies which open up during flowering like Grevillea lanigera, all allow weeds to germinate while the ground is exposed. Ground cover plants appear to deter weeds mainly by keeping weed seeds dormant through preventing red light from reaching weed seeds and triggering a phytochrome response leading to germination. Keeping the ratio of red to far-red light below 0. 3 appeared to give best inhibition of weed seed germination. Presence of mulch and spot application of selective herbicides can help prevent weeds causing problems should gaps appear within ground covers, and these may be preferable to hand weeding. Little herbicide tolerance information exists for ornamental ground cover plants, so herbicide tolerance trials were conducted on eight <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> <b>plant</b> species. This work showed that herbicides can aid in <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> <b>plant</b> establishment and subsequent maintenance to selectively spot-treat weeds that appear. Ground cover species were assessed which grow low enough to be mowed but which seldom need mowing, to replace grass turf in situations where mowing is inconvenient such as under trees, on slopes, or roadsides. Dichondra micrantha and Soleirolia soleirolii showed the most potential, forming dense low growing swards that tolerated a wide range of herbicides...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{coal mine}} {{operators}} in Wyoming must revegetate disturbed areas {{in order to}} achieve bond release. Reclaimed plant communities must meet specified criteria that are indicative of successful vegetation establishment. These criteria involve standards for total vegetation cover, total <b>ground</b> <b>cover,</b> <b>plant</b> production, shrub density, and species diversity. For some variables, reclaimed areas are compared to an undisturbed native community. Alternatively, the measured value from the reclamation may be compared to a technical standard (a fixed number), which is typically based on pre-mine conditions. In Wyoming, reclaimed vegetation cover and production are compared to cover and production on reference areas 1, shrub density is compared to a technical standard, and species diversity requirements are not yet standardized. The regulatory authority for coal mining in Wyoming, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Land Quality Division (LQD), is developing technical standards for species diversity, and for cover and production {{in some parts of the}} state. Regardless of the type of comparison, statistically valid tests must be used on quantitative data to determine if the reclaimed areas have successfully revegetated.

40|$|Fast {{revegetation}} {{by means}} of sowing seed mixture of shrub and herbaceous species is a measure to prevent bare soils from wind and water erosion. Field experiment {{was used to test}} the effect of species selection and the ratio of shrub to herbaceous species on vegetation formation and shrub growth. Results showed that herbaceous species hastened cover formation and maintained a high coverage for longer period. However, the growth of shrubs was hindered. In North China Plain or where the soil and climate are similar, the ratio of shrub to herbaceous seeds is proposed to be 6 : 4 – 7 : 3 (weight ratio). Among the herbaceous species tested, Festuca arundinacea Schreb. grows relatively slow so it should be mixed with other fast-growing species in the practice of rapid revegetation, and a seeding density lower than 6 g m − 2 is proposed when applied; Orychophragmus violaceus O.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} air temperature and thermal comfort conditions in mountainous region of Nafpaktia (Municipality of Apodotia, Prefecture of Aitoloakarnania), a region without important commercial, industrial or other activities in west continental Greece, and in Athens, a metropolitan urban center in southeast conti-nental Greece. There were 11 study {{sites in the}} case of Nafpaktia (676 – 1455 m altitude), areas with different altitude, <b>ground</b> <b>cover,</b> <b>plant</b> species and plant density. There was one study site in Athens (30 m altitude) nearby a densely built area, under the pressure of industrial activities and heavy traffic. Air temperature and humidity, 1. 5 m above ground surface, were monitored simultaneously every 15 min in each site for the period between 1 July and 31 August 2006. Air temperature and relative humidity data were used for the calculation of the thermohygrometric index (THI) from which thermal comfort conditions were evaluated. For this work, two sites of mountainous Nafpaktia region (MNR), one characterized by the lower (fir and chestnut forest area) and the other by the higher (Evinos River area) average THI value, are presented. Results showed that MNR provided clearly improved air temperature and thermal comfort conditions in comparison to Athens in the study period. Fir and chestnut forest area was more beneficial, from a bioclimatological point of view, compared to Evinos River area.

In the selection of species destined to <b>ground</b> <b>cover</b> <b>plant,</b> under no-till system, the amount and quality of plant residue should be considered. The objective was thus to evaluate the amount and quality of residues of different ground cover plants, produced in a short development period, under no-till system at the implementation stage in a dry-winter region. The experiment was conducted during the 1999 / 2000 cropping seasons at Experimental Farm of São Paulo State University-Botucatu (SP), on a Red Nitosol. The experimental design was organized as random blocks and four replicates. Plots consisted of : 1 - Sorghum bicolor (L.)
