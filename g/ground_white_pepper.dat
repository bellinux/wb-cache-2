2500|$|Borhani (or Burhani) is a spicy yogurt drink {{popular in}} Bangladesh {{and parts of}} Bengal. It is usually served with kacchi biryani at weddings and special feasts. Key {{ingredients}} are yogurt blended with mint leaves (mentha), mustard seeds and black rock salt (Kala Namak). Ground roasted cumin, <b>ground</b> <b>white</b> <b>pepper,</b> green chili pepper paste and sugar are often added. Lassi is a yogurt-based beverage originally from the Indian subcontinent that is usually slightly salty or sweet. Lassi is a staple in Punjab.

50|$|This {{version of}} ventricina {{is made from}} pork meat with added pork fat, the latter amounting to {{approximately}} 50-60% by weight of the finished product. The meat and fat are finely ground together and various spices are then added to the mixture. Most often these include garlic, salt, <b>ground</b> black and <b>white</b> <b>pepper,</b> hot and bell peppers, orange peel, rosemary, bell pepper paste, and fennel seeds. Other spices are sometimes added according to {{the taste of the}} producer. Traditionally, this mixture would be encased in the bladder, stomach, or intestines of the pig. More recently, synthetic casings have been employed or the mixture is simply stored in glass containers. Ventricina is often hung to cure in a cool dark place for several months before it is eaten. Ventricina teramana (that from the area around Teramo in Abruzzo) is most often eaten when it is young and has been allowed to age only a few months. Many people spread this delicacy on an open slice of bread. If desired the bread slices can be placed on the grill or in the oven for a period of time, thereby making a kind of bruschetta.|$|R

Nevertheless, Western style white bread and Indian breads made with wheat flour like roti canai are fairly common foods in the modern Malaysian diet today. A very typical way of serving white bread in Malaysia is having it toasted and spread with kaya, a sweet spread made from a base of coconut milk, eggs and sugar. Reflecting the British colonial influence in Malaysia, kaya toast or roti bakar is a popular breakfast staple and afternoon tea snack. It is typically paired {{with a cup of}} local brewed coffee or tea, and soft-boiled eggs to be seasoned to taste by the diner with soy sauce & <b>ground</b> <b>white</b> <b>pepper.</b> Roti kahwin is a variation where butter is sandwiched along with a layer of kaya between slices of untoasted white bread.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to explore the}} effects of <b>white</b> <b>pepper</b> and its major component piperine on puerarin administered to rats. Pharmacokinetic parameters of puerarin in rats were determined by oral administration (400 [*]mg/kg) or intravenous injection (40 [*]mg/kg) of puerarin, pretreated with or without <b>white</b> <b>pepper</b> and piperine given orally. Compared to the control group given oral puerarin only, the combined use of piperine (10 or 20 [*]mg/kg) increased the Cmax of puerarin by 1. 30 -fold or 1. 64 -fold and the AUC 0 –∞ by 133 % or 157 %, respectively. In contrast, coadministration of <b>white</b> <b>pepper</b> (125 or 250 [*]mg/kg) decreased oral absorption of puerarin to 83 % or 74 %, respectively. On the other hand, pretreatment with piperine orally did not alter the intravenous pharmacokinetics of puerarin, while the AUC of puerarin after intravenous administration was increased by pretreatment with <b>white</b> <b>pepper.</b> The results indicate that pretreatment with piperine or pepper exerts different effects on pharmacokinetics of puerarin administrated via intragastric and intravenous routes. Therefore, {{it is suggested that}} the combined application of piperine or <b>white</b> <b>pepper</b> with puerarin should be carefully monitored for potential diet-drug interactions...|$|R
