5|$|The Hermitage is a {{small stone}} shelter built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the gorge, above the river. It was {{designed}} by James Hamilton in the 1770s as a place for ladies to shelter while the men fished in the river.|$|E

5|$|Brought back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> for {{the second}} Test for the injured John Crawley, Key made a solitary run in the first innings, batting at number three, before being caught off the bowling of Shane Warne just after the lunch break. Relegated to number five in the second innings, with Mark Butcher and Nasser Hussain batting ahead of him, he again made just one before being caught off Andy Bichel.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand reluctantly ordered saps to be dug <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the mountain. The sapping was {{difficult}} and dangerous and the sappers worked under continuous {{attack from the}} castle's defenders, who fired on them with small arms and the castle's artillery and dropped rocks and debris on their heads. The forced labor of local peasants minimized losses among Ferdinand's own troops, {{but many of the}} peasants perished in the effort.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{managed to}} recover from his morning trouble to post the fourth fastest time in the second Practice Session on Friday afternoon. The Ferraris were still leading, but Massa was fastest, just 0.035 seconds ahead of Räikkönen. However, {{one of the major}} surprises came from Scuderia Toro Rosso, as Scott Speed posted the third quickest time, with Vitantonio Liuzzi posting the fifth quickest time. During the session, Liuzzi was {{involved}} in a bizarre incident with Anthony Davidson; Davidson exited his garage, and smashed his Super Aguri <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of Liuzzi's Toro Rosso; knocking his front wing off in the accident. Alonso finished the second practice session eighth.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, {{the club}} was {{purchased}} by Lebanese businessman Sam Hammam, who invested money <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> and saw them rise from the fourth tier to the second tier in just three seasons. Although Hammam left the club in 2006, they continued their progress, reaching the Football League Championship play-offs for three consecutive seasons between 2009 and 2012, suffering defeat on all three occasions. The following season, under the ownership of new owner Vincent Tan, they finished first in the Championship, winning promotion back into the top tier {{for the first time}} since 1962. However, they suffered relegation in their only season and returned to the Championship where they currently remain.|$|E
5|$|In the 1947–48 season, the England cricket team {{toured the}} West Indies. When the team played in Trinidad, Ganteaume scored 101 and 47 not {{out in the}} first match but journalists criticised him for scoring slowly in easy batting conditions. In a second match against the touring side, he scored 5 and 90 but was not {{selected}} in the team for the Test match which followed—Ganteaume later suggested his non-selection was a result of his underprivileged background. However, an injury to Jeff Stollmeyer, one of the West Indies' opening batsmen, before the game meant that Ganteaume was called up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} fought at the {{location}} of the modern city of San Lorenzo, Santa Fe which is next to the Paraná River, at the point of its widest flow. The west bank of the river was tall and steep, forming a natural obstacle, and ships could only land troops and materials {{on that side of the}} river using man-made paths cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b> The battlefield was near one of these paths, shaped like a ladder, after which the terrain was a big plain with scattered bushes. The San Carlos Convent, the main nearby building, was a short distance away from the river.|$|E

5|$|The castle was rebuilt in {{the late}} 16th century. A new five-storey east range was built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the rock, and the {{gatehouse}} was rebuilt, {{this time with a}} permanent stone bridge. The upper part of the east range was renovated in 1622, with renaissance details and carving to door and window surrounds. Roslin suffered again from the artillery of Cromwell’s commander in Scotland, General Monck, in 1650. It was further damaged by a Reforming mob in 1688.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} terraced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of a mound, so the {{northern}} {{side of the}} basement is partially below ground level. As was typical of most keeps, the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, {{the interior of the}} basement dates mostly from the 18thcentury when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts. The basement is lit through small slits.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the return}} of Tesche on a {{permanent}} contract seemed likely to endanger Davis's first-team place, he began the 2016–17 season in the starting eleven. He was booked {{in each of the}} first four matches, but two goals and a series of strong performances meant that when the fifth booking finally arrived in mid-October, he came straight back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> after serving his suspension. He was named man of the match in the Second City derby against Aston Villa. Initially used on the right of midfield to counteract the attacking threat of Jordan Amavi, he moved into a more familiar central role after David Cotterill entered the match, and within minutes scored the equalising goal with a composed finish {{from the edge of the}} penalty area. The goal earned him the club's Moment of the Season award.|$|E

50|$|The points {{exiting the}} up {{platform}} loop onto the running line, were interlocked with those <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>siding,</b> meaning {{that when the}} points were set to allow trains through on the running line, the points would also be automatically set to divert any trains running forward on <b>the</b> loop <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>siding,</b> {{to prevent them from}} accidentally running onto the running line. There were two signalboxes at the north and south ends of the station, each controlling the points and signals from either direction.|$|R
50|$|Spaunton Quarry {{was started}} in 1928 and a 1930 {{agreement}} with the LNER provided a siding into Sinnington station facing eastwards. <b>The</b> <b>siding</b> was worked by the Pickering bound goods which would halt at Sinnington and reverse <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>siding.</b> <b>The</b> track was not maintained to a good standard and {{after a number of}} derailments, <b>the</b> <b>siding</b> was not used from February 1948.|$|R
5|$|He joined fellow Championship side Stoke City for a £225,000 fee in August 2006. He {{was made}} captain when Michael Duberry left in January 2007 and Stoke {{went on to}} {{narrowly}} miss out on a play-off place. With Stoke not being promoted Higginbotham again decided to hand in a transfer request to help force through a move to Sunderland. He spent one season at the Stadium of Light before returning to Stoke in 2008. He became a vital member of Tony Pulis' squad as Stoke established themselves in the Premier League. He scored the winning goal in the FA Cup quarter-final against West Ham United but missed out on both the semi-final and the final due to a knee injury. After his recovery he struggled to force his way back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> and spent time out on loan to Nottingham Forest and Ipswich Town before joining Sheffield United on a free transfer in January 2013. After eight months at Bramall Lane, he left to join Conference Premier side Chester before ending his career with a short spell at Altrincham.|$|E
5|$|In October 1963, London Transport ordered five {{double decker}} buses {{based on the}} Ford Thames Trader chassis for special duties, taking cyclists through the Dartford Tunnel. These had a lower deck {{purpose-built}} for carrying bicycles, with upper deck seats for cyclists. Access was via a stairwell to the upper deck starting several feet above {{the level of the}} road, accessible from special platforms built {{at either end of the}} tunnel; there was also a ladder built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the bodywork for access elsewhere. The design was criticised for failing to protect any passenger from falling off the vehicle, and running costs were estimated at £2,550 per month, with only £45 revenue. The service was reduced to one bus in April 1964 and then cancelled in 1965, to be replaced by the current transfer service. One of these buses has been preserved.|$|E
5|$|India {{remained}} unchanged {{from the side}} that played the semi-final, while Australia excluded Ian Harvey and brought back Damien Martyn <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side.</b> Ganguly won the toss and elected to field first. Zaheer Khan opened the bowling for India along with Javagal Srinath. The Australian openers scored aggressively {{from the beginning of}} the innings as Khan conceded 15 runs in the first over. Gilchrist in particular hit both Khan and Srinath for many runs and reached his 50 from 40 balls. When Ganguly turned to his spin bowlers as early as the tenth over, Gilchrist slowed his scoring rate. In the fourteenth over, when Harbhajan Singh was brought back to bowl, Gilchrist (57 off 48 balls) tried to hit him over the mid-wicket, but was beaten by the ball's extra bounce and caught in the deep by Virender Sehwag. The pair had added 105 runs for the first wicket. Harbhajan struck again in the twentieth over when he dismissed Hayden (37 runs off 54 balls), leaving the score at 125 runs.|$|E

5|$|On lap thirty-one, Buemi {{tried to}} pass Glock on the outside heading into turn three but lost control of his car under braking and rammed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of Glock. Buemi {{sustained}} a broken left, front suspension and front wing damage, causing him to retire. The incident called for the race's third safety car period. During the safety car deployment, most of the drivers made pit stops for intermediate tyres. Alonso, who was called in by Ferrari when Vettel changed his strategy, had a pit stop that proved problematic. He arrived into his pit box sideways after locking his tyres. One of his mechanics could not fit his front right wheel because he dropped a wheel nut; he was required to fit a spare wheel nut onto the tyre, causing Alonso to be stationary for longer than usual. He lost third place to Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|The Odyssey {{is capable}} of {{displaying}} three square dots and a vertical line on the screen. Two of the dots are controlled by the two players, and the third by the system itself. The main console has two dials, one of which moves the vertical line across the screen, and one which adjusts {{the speed of the}} computer-controlled dot. Different games direct the player to adjust the dials to different positions, for example to change the center line of a tennis game <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> wall of a handball game. The games include plastic overlays which stick to the television via static cling, to create visuals for the game. Different games that use the same game card can have different overlays, which can change a game with the same controls from, for example, a mountain ski path to a movement-based Simon Says game.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Smith's run of {{consecutive games}} {{came to an}} end against Reading in October 1958, with Jim McCusker coming <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> to replace him for two games. Smith's number of consecutive appearances is third on the club's list behind Mulholland's 231 games and Charlie Bicknell. He played 26 further games in the 1958–59 season, in which the club finished 11th in the newy-formed Third Division. The season proved to be Smith's final season for City as he decided to retire aged 31. His last game was a 2–1 defeat, once again versus Reading, on 28 February 1959. When the season finished, Smith had played a total of 270 games for the club, 253 of which came in the league, keeping a club record 70 clean sheets. His record stood until it was broken by Paul Tomlinson in the 1990s. When Smith retired, the club granted him and Mulholland each a sum of money rather than the proceeds of a benefit match.|$|E
