This view was shared by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and UNC Commander General Mark W.

Still, Radford's frankness during the trip and his knowledge of Asia made a good impression on Eisenhower, who nominated Radford to be his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.|$|E

Later that same month the Chronicle reported on another dealing by the Senator. Since 1999, Perata's campaign fund and various other political committees had paid <b>Exit</b> <b>Strategies</b> more than $743,000, according to campaign finance documents. <b>Exit</b> <b>Strategies,</b> a political direct mail firm, was launched in 1999 by Perata's son, Nick, and based at his father's Alameda County home. By their own accounting, <b>Exit</b> <b>Strategies</b> paid the senator nearly $138,000 during the same period for rent and consulting fees. The Senate Ethics Committee again ruled that this was not an actionable violation, but it raised questions into the propriety of the relationship.|$|R
