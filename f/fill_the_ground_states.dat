40|$|We use the {{numerical}} renormalization group method {{to investigate the}} spectral properties of a single-impurity Anderson model with a gap δ across the Fermi level in the conduction-electron spectrum. For any finite δ > 0, at half <b>filling</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> of <b>the</b> system is always a doublet. Away from half filling a quantum phase transition (QPT) occurs as function of the gap value δ, and the system evolves from the strong-coupling (SC) Kondo-type state, corresponding to δ δ_C. The opening of the gap leads {{to the formation of}} one (two) bound states when the system is in the SC (LM) regime. The evolution across the QPT of their positions and the corresponding weights together with the dynamic properties of the model are investigated. Comment: 6 pages, 6 eps figure...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{strength}} of nematic fluctuations with a finite wave vector in a two-dimensional metal, we compute the static d-wave polarization function for tight-binding electrons on a square lattice. At Van Hove filling and zero temperature the function diverges logarithmically at q= 0. Away from Van Hove <b>filling</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> polarization function exhibits finite peaks at finite wave vectors. A nematic instability driven by a sufficiently strong attraction in the d-wave charge channel thus leads naturally to a spatially modulated nematic state, with a modulation vector that increases in length with the distance from Van Hove filling. Above Van Hove filling, for a Fermi surface crossing the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary, the modulation vector connects antiferromagnetic hot spots with collinear Fermi velocities.

40|$|We study {{ground-state}} {{properties of}} a triangular triple quantum dot connected to two superconducting (SC) leads. In this system orbital motion along the triangular configuration causes {{various types of}} quantum phases, such as the SU(4) Kondo state and the Nagaoka ferromagnetic mechanism, depending on <b>the</b> electron <b>filling.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> also evolves as the Cooper pairs penetrate from the SC leads. We describe the phase diagram {{in a wide range}} of the parameter space, varying the gate voltage, the couplings between the dots and leads, and also the Josephson phase between the SC gaps. The results are obtained in the limit of large SC gap, carrying out exact diagonalization of an effective Hamiltonian. We also discuss in detail a classification of the quantum states according to the fixed point of the Wilson numerical renormalization group (NRG).

40|$|In a {{two-dimensional}} electron gas at ν= 1 (where <b>the</b> <b>filling</b> factor ν=neh/eB measures how many Landau levels (LL) are <b>filled)</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> {{should be regarded as}} a ferromagnet since all the spin down states in the lowest LL are occupied while all the spin up states are empty. In GaAs the single particle (SP) Zeeman energy (ZE) gμBB is very small 0. 3 K/T, and Coulomb interactions are very significant. This has led several authors to suggest that novel charged excitations with number of reversed spin R> 1, and with non-trivial spin order, known as charged spin-texture excitations or Skyrmions, may occur [1, 2].

40|$|We study Bose-Hubbard {{models on}} tight-binding, non-Bravais lattices, with a filling of one boson per unit cell—and thus {{fractional}} site filling. We discuss situations where no classical bosonic insulator, {{which is a}} product state of particles on independent sites, is admitted. Nevertheless, we show {{that it is possible}} to construct a quantum Mott insulator of bosons if a trivial band insulator of fermions is possible at <b>the</b> same <b>filling.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> wave function is simply a permanent of exponentially localized Wannier orbitals.

40|$|We studied time-resolved photocarrier {{transport}} through InAs/GaAs {{quantum dot}} superlattice (QDSL) solar cells (SCs) using time-of-flight spectroscopy with an optical probe QD structure beneath the QDSL. Carriers optically pumped {{in the top}} p-GaAs layer were transported through the intrinsic layer, including the QDSLs, before arriving at the probe QDs. The photoexcited carrier density significantly influenced the time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) of the QDSLs and probe QDs. The time-resolved PL profile of the probe QDs indicated that excitation densities in excess of 25 nJ/cm(2) drastically decreased the rise time, suggesting rapid carrier transport through the QDSLs. This was also confirmed by QDSL carrier transport dynamics, for which the PL intensity of the excited states decayed rapidly above this excitation power density, 25 nJ/cm(2), while <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> remained constant. These results demonstrate that <b>filling</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>states</b> of QDSLs and starting to populate the excited state miniband accelerates carrier transport in QDSL SCs.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is strongly influenced by {{the choice of the}} local basis of the underlying physical lattice. We demonstrate that, for the two-dimensional Hubbard model, the hybrid real-momentum space formulation of the DMRG is computationally more efficient than the standard real-space formulation. In particular, we show that the computational cost for fixed bond dimension of the hybrid-space DMRG is approximately independent of the width of the lattice, in contrast to the real-space DMRG, for which it is proportional to the width squared. We apply the hybrid-space algorithm to calculate <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> of <b>the</b> doped two-dimensional Hubbard model on cylinders of width four and six sites; at $n= 0. 875 $ <b>filling,</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> exhibits a striped charge-density distribution with a wavelength of eight sites for both $U/t= 4. 0 $ and $U/t= 8. 0 $.

Furthermore, we investigate the magnetic ordering as well as the decay of the static spin, charge, and pair-field correlation functions. Comment: 16 pages, 14 figure...|$|R
40|$|By using variational wave {{functions}} and quantum Monte Carlo techniques, we investigate {{the interplay between}} electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the two-dimensional Hubbard-Holstein model. Here, the ground-state phase diagram is triggered by several energy scales, i. e., the electron hopping t, the on-site electron-electron interaction U, the phonon energy ω 0, and the electron-phonon coupling g. At half <b>filling,</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> is an antiferromagnetic insulator for U≳ 2 g 2 /ω 0, while it is a charge-density-wave (or bipolaronic) insulator for U≲ 2 g 2 /ω 0. In addition to these phases, we find a superconducting phase that intrudes between them. For ω 0 /t= 1, superconductivity emerges when both U/t and 2 g 2 /tω 0 are small; then, by increasing {{the value of the}} phonon energy ω 0, it extends along the transition line between antiferromagnetic and charge-density-wave insulators. Away from half filling, phase separation occurs when doping the charge-density-wave insulator, while a uniform (superconducting) <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> is found when doping the superconducting phase.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new class of <b>ground</b> <b>states</b> for doped Mott {{insulators}} in the electron second-quantization representation. They are obtained from a bosonic resonating valence bond (RVB) theory of the t-J model. At half <b>filling,</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> describes spin correlations of the S= 1 / 2 Heisenberg model very accurately. Its spin degrees of freedom are characterized by RVB pairing of spins, the size of which decreases continuously as holes are doped into the system. Charge degrees of freedom emerge upon doping and are described by twisted holes in the RVB background. We show that the twisted holes exhibit an off diagonal long range order (ODLRO) in <b>the</b> pseudogap <b>ground</b> <b>state,</b> which has a finite pairing amplitude, but is short of phase coherence. Unpaired spins in such a pseudogap <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> behave as free vortices, preventing superconducting phase coherence. The existence of nodal quasiparticles is also ensured by such a hidden ODLRO in <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state,</b> which is non-Fermi-liquid-like in the absence of superconducting phase coherence.

Gg The Kondo models, or single and lattice impurity models, {{are one of the most}} challenging subjects in strongly correlated systems 1 – 3. Recent developments of reflection positivity technique in the spin space make it possible to establish some rigorous results for the half-filled strongly correlated electron systems 4 – 9. Theory of reflection positivity in the spin space for the single- and multi-channel Kondo models with spin 1 / 2 was developed recently and a series of rigorous results on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> properties were proved 8, 9. However some materials are described by the Kondo models with large spin, such as (La 1 −xXx) MnO 3 with X = Ba, Ca, Sr etc. and the localised spin s = 3 / 2 10. Due to more degrees of freedom in the case of large spin than in the case of spin 1 / 2, usually it is very hard to extract rigorous results for those systems. As a generalisation of the theory for the Kondo model with spin 1 / 2, we will investigate the Kondo model with large spin and provide some rigorous results on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> of <b>the</b> Kondo model in the case of half filling.

40|$|Inversion and {{depletion}} regions generally form at the interfaces between doped leads (cladding layers) and {{the active}} region of polar heterostructures like AlN/GaN and other nitride compounds. The band bending in the depletion region {{sets up a}} barrier that may seriously impede perpendicular electronic transport. This may ruin the performance of devices such as quantum-cascade lasers and resonant-tunneling diodes. Here we introduce the concepts of polarization balance and polarization-balanced designs: A structure is polarization balanced when the applied bias match the voltage drop arising from spontaneous and piezeolectric fields. Devices designed to operate at this bias have polarization-balanced designs. These concepts offer a systematic approach to avoid the formation of depletion regions. As a test case, we consider the design of AlN/GaN double-barrier structures with Al((x) over tilde) Ga(1 -(x) over tilde) N leads. To guide our efforts, we derive a simple relation between the intrinsic voltage drop arising from polar effects, average alloy composition of the active region, and the alloy concentration of the leads.

The excited state calculations used a constrained occupancy approach by setting the occupation of the Ce 4 f states to zero and allowing the first excited state above them to be filled. These calculations were performed on a set of Ce doped materials that are known from experiment to be scintillators or non-scintillators to relate theoretically calculable parameters to measured scintillator performance. From these studies we developed a set of criteria based on calculated parameters that are necessary characteristics for bright Ce activated scintillators. Applying these criteria to about a hundred new materials we developed a list of candidate materials for new bright Ce activated scintillators. After synthesis in powder form one of these new materials (Ba 2 YCl 7 :Ce) was found to be a bright scintillator. This approach, involving first-principles calculations of modest computing requirements was designed as a systematic, high-throughput method to aid in the discovery of new bright scintillator materials by prioritization and down-selection on the large number of potential new materials.

40|$|We {{consider}} the one-band Hubbard model {{on the square}} lattice by using variational and Green's function Monte Carlo methods, where the variational states contain Jastrow and backflow correlations {{on top of an}} uncorrelated wave function that includes BCS pairing and magnetic order. At half <b>filling,</b> where <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> is antiferromagnetically ordered for any value of the on-site interaction U, we can identify a hidden critical point U_ Mott, above which a finite BCS pairing is stabilized in the wave function. The existence of this point is reminiscent of the Mott transition in the paramagnetic sector and determines a separation between a Slater insulator (at small values of U), where magnetism induces a potential energy gain, and a Mott insulator (at large values of U), where magnetic correlations drive a kinetic energy gain. Most importantly, the existence of U_ Mott has crucial consequences when doping the system: We observe a tendency to phase separation into a hole-rich and a hole-poor region only when doping the Slater insulator, while the system is uniform by doping the Mott insulator. Superconducting correlations are clearly observed above U_ Mott, leading to the characteristic dome structure in doping. Furthermore, we show that the energy gain due to the presence of a finite BCS pairing above U_ Mott shifts from the potential to the kinetic sector by increasing the value of the Coulomb repulsion.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a brief review of}} our recent studies {{concerning}} on magnetism and electronic states of lattice systems with Hund coupling. First we examined the effectiveness of the Hund coupling in realizing ferromagnetism in the doubly degenerate Hubbard model. One- and infinite-dimensional systems were studied and thereby dimensional dependence was discussed. In quarter-filled systems the insulating ferromagnetic state accompanied by alternating orbital order was found stable. In more-than-quarter filling cases metallic ferromagnetism is stabilized by the ``double exchange mechanism''. These results are common to one and infinite dimensions. In less-than-quarter <b>filling</b> cases <b>the</b> ferromagnetic <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> is stable in one dimension but not in infinite dimensions. Secondly we examined the electronic states and the resistivity in the double exchange model by using the one-particle Green function. The splitting and narrowing of the one-particle spectrum due to the Hund coupling were clarified in the framework of a single-site approximation. The resistivity due to the scattering by random localized spins was shown to be too small to explain the experimental results of doped manganites.

40|$|The noninteracting {{electronic}} {{structures of}} tight binding models on bipartite lattices with unequal numbers of {{sites in the}} two sublattices {{have a number of}} unique features, including the presence of spatially localized eigenstates and flat bands. When a uniform on-site Hubbard interaction U is turned on, Lieb proved rigorously that at half <b>filling</b> (ρ= 1) <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> has a non-zero spin. In this paper we consider a `CuO_ 2 lattice (also known as `Lieb lattice', or as a decorated square lattice), in which `d-orbitals' occupy the vertices of the squares, while `p-orbitals' lie halfway between two d-orbitals. We use exact Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations to quantify the nature of magnetic order through the behavior of correlation functions and sublattice magnetizations in the different orbitals as a function of U and temperature. We study both the homogeneous (H) case, U_d= U_p, originally considered by Lieb, and the inhomogeneous (IH) case, U_d≠ U_p. For the H case at half filling, we found that the global magnetization rises sharply at weak coupling, and then stabilizes towards the strong-coupling (Heisenberg) value, {{as a result of the}} interplay between the ferromagnetism of like sites and the antiferromagnetism between unlike sites; we verified that the system is an insulator for all U. For the IH system at half filling, we argue that the case U_p≠ U_d falls under Lieb's theorem, provided they are positive definite, so we used DQMC to probe the cases U_p= 0,U_d=U and U_p=U, U_d= 0. We found that the different environments of d and p sites lead to a ferromagnetic insulator when U_d= 0; by contrast, U_p= 0 leads to to a metal without any magnetic ordering. In addition, we have also established that at density ρ= 1 / 3, strong antiferromagnetic correlations set in, caused by the presence of one fermion on each d site. Comment: 10 pages, 14 figure...|$|R

Moreover, with the expressions of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> energy, we can exactly determine <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> energy and <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> particle density of the systems by taking...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} {{a set of}} exact <b>ground</b> <b>states</b> with a localized ferromagnetic domain wall and an extended spiral structure in a quasi-one-dimensional deformed flatband Hubbard model. In the case of quarter <b>filling,</b> we show <b>the</b> uniqueness of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> with a fixed magnetization. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>states</b> with these structures are degenerate with the all-spin-up and all-spin-down states. This property of the degeneracy {{is the same as}} the domain wall solutions in the XXZ Heisenberg-Ising model. We derive a useful recursion relation for the normalization of <b>the</b> domain wall <b>ground</b> <b>state.</b> Using this recursion relation, we discuss the convergence of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> expectation values of arbitrary local operators in the infinite-volume limit. In <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> of <b>the</b> infinite-volume system, the translational symmetry is spontaneously broken by this structure. We prove that the cluster property holds for <b>the</b> domain wall <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> and excited states. We also estimate bounds of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> expectation values of several observables, such as one- and two-poin...|$|R
40|$|We prove an {{adiabatic}} theorem for the nonautonomous semilinear Gross–Pitaevskii equation. More precisely, {{we assume}} that the external potential decays suitably at infinity and the linear Schrödinger operator −Δ+V_s admits exactly one bound <b>state,</b> which is <b>ground</b> <b>state,</b> for any s∈[0, 1]. In the nonlinear setting, <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> bifurcates into a manifold of (small) <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> solutions. We show that, if the initial condition is at <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> manifold, bifurcated from <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> of −Δ+V_ 0, then, for any fixed s∈[0, 1], as ε→ 0, the solution will converge to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> manifold bifurcated from <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> of −Δ+V_s. Moreover, the limit is of the same mass to the initial condition...|$|R
