40|$|Drops and {{filaments}} {{are prominent}} in inkjet printing, surface and bulk property measurement, atomization, genomic analysis and drug discovery. Accurate prediction of their dynamics {{is the major}} objective of this thesis. Predicting the formation of drops from a capillary {{and analysis of the}} effects of surfactants and heat on the deformation and/or breakup of liquid filaments are central goals of this thesis. These situations are studied by one of two approaches: one-dimensional (1 -d) analysis based on the slender-jet approximation which, when appropriate to use, results in two to three orders of magnitude reduction in computational time and exact two-dimensional (2 -d) analysis using Galerkin/finite element method. Algorithms are developed for analyzing (i) the formation of hundreds of consecutive drops from capillaries, (ii) the effects of surfactants on the nonlinear deformation and/or breakup of stretching and oscillating liquid bridges and (iii) the deflection of planar jets emerging out of 2 -d channels when asymmetric heating or wetting is imposed at the slot exit. Key {{to the success of the}} 2 -d algorithms is the generation of meshes that can follow the deformation of the free surface(s). For this purpose, algebraic and elliptic mesh generation techniques are employed. In drop formation from a capillary at constant flow rate, the 1 -d algorithm developed in this thesis is demonstrated to be within 1 – 2 % of established rigorous 2 -d algorithms at low flow rates. However, the 1 -d predictions can err by 10 – 15 % at high flow rates and be in total disagreement with the 2 -d predictions in analyses of (i) drop formation when the flow rate is oscillatory or (ii) contraction of free liquid filaments, which are models of satellites. Analyses of surfactant-laden bridges reveal that convection-diffusion of an insoluble surfactant along an interface can result in complex interplay with the bulk flow and significantly alter the breakup of stretching liquid bridges and the frequency response of oscillating liquid bridges. Studies on the effects of differential wetting and heating on the deflection of planar jets yield windows of operation in the space of governing parameters that are favorable to significant <b>deflection.</b> <b>Channel</b> geometry is shown to contribute nontrivially to the angular momentum of the jet. The methods reported here are not only of scientific interest but should prove indispensable in future studies of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). ...|$|E

50|$|There are two {{possible}} scenarios when {{the path of}} a stream is blocked by an uplifted block of rock. First scenario: the stream poses stream power that is high enough to cut through the uplifted rocks, so that the river course will not be significantly altered. A channel is opened in the uplifted rocks due to erosion, a landform known as water gap. It continues to flow until the rock is further uplifted and the river no longer has enough erosive power to cut through it, leading to the second scenario. Second scenario: the stream does not have enough erosive power to cut through the rocks, so it deflected to flow along the boundary of the uplifted block as aforementioned. The abandoned river channel is known as wind gap. From here, the river either flows along the boundary of the fold and bends around the fold tip, or it may cut through the rocks at some points despite the block, due to either, acquisition of enough stream power through stream capture of small tributaries along its flow, or the presence of a particularly weak spot in the rock''''. In either way the river continues to flow until further uplift of rocks makes the rock too difficult for the river to cut through, which results in, again, the <b>deflection</b> of the <b>channel</b> and formation of a new wind gap.|$|R

The earthquake revealed 45 -km-long of surface ruptures inland, trending N 70 E, and 5. 5 m of maximum right lateral offset near Güzelköy. The long-term deformation of the fault is clearly expressed by several pull-apart basins and sag ponds, pressure and shutter ridges and offset streams. In parallel with detailed geomorphologic investigations, we measured co-seismic and cumulative displacements along the fault, and selected the Güzelköy site for paleoseismology. A microtopographic survey at the site yields 10. 5 0. 5 m and 35. 4 1. 5 m cumulative lateral offsets of stream channels and geomorphologic features. Seven paleoseismic parallel and cross-fault trenches document successive faulting events and provide the timing of past earthquakes on the Ganos fault segment. Radiocarbon dating of successive colluvial wedges in trench T 1, and the fresh scarplet above (probably 1912 surface rupture) indicate the occurrence of three faulting events since the 14 th century. Parallel trenches (3, 5, 6 and 7) expose paleo-channels and show a cumulative right-lateral offset of 16. 5 1. 5 m next to the fault, and 21. 3 1. 5 m total <b>channel</b> <b>deflection.</b> Radiocarbon dating of past channel units and fault scarp-related colluvial deposits imply an average 17 +/ 5 mm/year slip rate and 323 142 years recurrence interval of large earthquakes during the last 1000 years on the Ganos fault.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 163 - 171) Microfiche. xi, 171 leaves, bound ill., maps 29 cmInterpretations of SeaMARC II side-scan sonar, analog single-channel seismic {{reflection and}} 3. 5 kHz profiles across {{the intersection of}} the Nazca plate with the Peru-Chile trench in the Nazca Ridge and Arica Bight-Iquique areas were used to describe the geomorphology and topography of these two sections of the Nazca-South America plate convergence. In the Nazca Ridge area, the entry of the aseismic Nazca Ridge into the southern Peru trench causes the uplift of the overriding continental margin. The uplift of the continental margin is indicated by a) shoaling of the trench axis, b) tilting of the slope terraces, c) raised marine terraces, d) <b>deflection</b> of submarine <b>channels</b> and onshore rivers, and e) an uplifted marine forearc basin. The similarity of morphologic features between the uplifted region of the continental margin and the Nazca Ridge suggests that the extent of uplifted region of the continental margin is controlled by the geometry of the subducting Nazca Ridge. In the Arica Bight-Iquique area, the subduction of the more highly faulted trough-like relief of the Nazca plate under the continental margin is interpreted to have resulted in the subsidence of this section of the overriding continental margin. The subsidence of the continental margin in this section of the convergence is demonstrated by a) deepening of the curved trench, b) depression of the slope terraces and forearc basin, c) subsidence of the upper slope ridge and platform, d) formation of the offshore and onshore semi-centripetal drainage pattern. and e) landward retreating of the coastal cliff. The mechanism for the uplift of the overriding continental margin in the Nazca Ridge area is due to the gravity isostatic buoyancy difference between the less-dense, thicker crust of the subducted Nazca Ridge and its adjacent, denser oceanic crusts. Conversely, the subsidence of the overriding continental margin in the Arica Bight-Iquique area may have resulted from the isostatic sinking of the denser crust of the subducted, trough-like structure of the oceanic plate...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{extension}} of the works by Whiting and Dietrich 1993, Silva 1995 and Termini 1995. These authors have found that the initial flow patterns in sine-generated meandering channels are mainly a function of the <b>channels</b> <b>deflection</b> angle theta 0. (Initial flow is the flow present in the channel prior to any bed deformation). However, the aforementioned works are restricted to cases of 2 ̆ 2 small 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 large 2 ̆ 2 theta 0; the flow pattern in the small theta 0 -channels have been termed ingoing and in the large theta 0 -channels, outgoing. In this thesis the flow patterns in channels having intermediate values of theta 0 were investigated experimentally. The main objectives are: (1) to determine the relationship between flow patterns and plan shape, for the purpose of determining the transition region between ingoing and outgoing flow patterns, (2) to develop a database for use by other researchers in the calibration of numerical models. The experiments were carried out in three different channels defined by theta 0 = 90 °, 70 °, and 50 °. The experimental facility was designed to allow for the same recirculating flow system to be used for all channels. The channels themselves were 40 cm wide, with a rectangular cross-section. All three channels conveyed a 3 [...] 3. 2 cm deep flow, with flow rates in the range of 1. 5 to 2. 8 l/s for the purpose of measuring the vertically-averaged longitudinal flow velocity u, deviation angle w 2 ̆ 6 d 1;c and flow depth h. It was found that the flow in the 90 °-channel was outgoing, while the flow in the 50 °-channel was ingoing. These findings were supported by both the deviation angle and velocity measurements. The initial flow in the 70 °-channel was found to be neither ingoing nor outgoing, but rather a transitional flow between ingoing and outgoing. A discussion of a possible correlation between the velocity of expansion of a meandering channel and the maximum vertically-averaged deviation angle has also been presented.

40|$|In 2004 the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) was {{established}} by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to quickly identify, secure, remove and/or closely monitor nuclear and radiological materials that pose a high-risk threat to the United States and the international community. Part of GTRI's mission is to convert high performance research reactors and isotope production facilities from their current High Enriched Uranium (HEU) fuel to Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) foil based fuel. In compliance with the conversion portion of the GTRI's mission, the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) is currently trying to convert its reactor fuel. The proposed fuel uses a monolithic U- 10 Mo foil meat with a zirconium barrier between the aluminum cladding. This is different than the current HEU fuel meat which is comprised of Uranium dispersed in an aluminum matrix in an aluminum cladding. In addition {{to a change in}} the physical structure of the fuel, the fuel plate thickness has been significantly decreased. The fuel plates in the MURR reactor are subject to high velocity coolant (water) flow. A decreased thickness in the fuel plate suggests that the rigidity of the fuel plate will decrease as well. With concerns about the hydro-mechanical stability of the newly designed fuel plate being exposed to the high velocity flows in the reactor, {{there is a need to}} characterize the structural response of a very thin plate in presence of a velocity flow. Fluid structure interaction (FSI) simulations have been developed to analyze all of the characteristics of a thin fuel plate as the velocity of the water increases across the fuel plate. These models are developed by coupling CFD software, STAR CCM+, with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software, ABAQUS, to determine the magnitude, location and direction of the deflection of the fuel plate along with other useful metrics to characterize attributes of the flow and movement of the plate. The FSI simulations were designed to replicate the plate thickness, fluid channel geometry and velocities of the experimental set up. The experimental set up consists of a flow loop and curved test section have been constructed for studying plate <b>deflection</b> and <b>channel</b> pressure drop under a variety of fluid flow velocities. The test section consists of two concentric steel cylinders bolted together with spacers between the two to form a fluid channel. The fuel plate inside the test section is clamped at the edges to maintain the axial location of the plate in the fluid channel. The aluminum fuel plate in the test section is 25. 5 inches long, 16 mils (0. 016 inches) thick and has an arc of 45 degrees. The outer cylinder of the test section has five plexi-glass windows that allow deflection data to be collected at various locations by the laser measurement system. The laser measurement system was fixed at the leading edge of the fuel plate because that is where the maximum deflection has been shown to occur. Since the focus of this study is on the maximum deflection of the fuel plate, the laser measurement system was fixed at that point. The FSI simulations were based on seven different geometries. The first consideration was an ideal geometry that the test section was designed to reflect. This consisted of a 130 mils thick inner fluid channel and a 78 mils thick outer fluid channel. Because the test section was assembled at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and then shipped to the University of Missouri, the dimensions of the test section fluid channel geometry was altered during transit. This change in the shape of the fluid channels lead to the need to characterize the shape of the fuel plate and fluid channels again. Since it is physically impossible to characterize the geometry of the entire fuel plate and the azimuthal geometry of the fluid channels of the test section without disassembling it, several geometric options were considered. Three geometries for the shape of the fuel plate were considered. The three fuel plate shapes were based on the distance of the plate based on the distance between the inner radius of the outer cylinder and the location of the fuel plate in the fluid channel. These measurements were obtained by measuring the outer channel gap thickness with a depth micrometer at the pressure tap locations that coincide with the location of the plate. Although this was helpful, it only helped to characterize the shape of the plate between the leading and trailing edges of the plate. This left about eight inches of the fuel plate (4 inches at each end) uncharacterized, leading to the three geometric considerations. The three geometric considerations were combined with two geometric considerations for the fluid channels. An azimuthally constant and varied geometry was considered. This was prompted by the inability to measure the distance of the fluid channels in the azimuthal direction due to the design of the test section. This lead to developing a geometry for the fluid channels that was constant along the azimuthal direction of the fuel plate and another where the fluid channel decreased in thickness as the azimuthal location progressed from the middle of the test section to the edges where the spacers are located. The FSI simulations and the experiments produced deflection results for the 16 mils (0. 016 inches) thick fuel plate at velocities ranging from approximately 2 m/s to 4 m/s. Because the fuel plate is so thin, it has been decided that the velocity in the FSI simulations and experiments should be kept relatively low to avoid permanently damaging the aluminum plate in the test section. The As-Built numeric models have been shown to compare well with the experimental results. The As-Built numeric model results also show that the constant azimuthal fluid channel geometry produces a smaller magnitude of deflection for all three fuel plate shapes considered when compared to the models with a varying azimuthal geometry. the FSI simulations "crashed" for all models ran with a velocity beyond 4 m/s. The experimental results showed that maximum deflection results can be obtained beyond 4 m/s. This provides the opportunity to investigate the differences between the experimental and modeling geometries and recalibrate the model to obtain maximum deflection results through the FSI simulations...|$|R
40|$|The Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic geology of New Zealand {{represents}} {{the evolution of}} a post-Gondwana, Pacific-facing passive margin which interacted, first, with the mid-Cenozoic development of the Australian/Antarctic and Australian/Pacific plate boundaries and, second, with the subsequent development of the oceanic thermohaline circulation system. Situated between the Tasmanian and southwest Pacific oceanic current gateways, the stratigraphy of the New Zealand region provides our best record of the evolution of the Pacific Ocean's largest deep cold-water inflow, the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC), and also possesses an important record of Antarctic Intermediate Water flow. Prior to Leg 181, our knowledge of southwest Pacific Ocean history and, in particular, the development of the DWBC and its local partner, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), was poor. Seven holes were therefore drilled east of New Zealand to determine the stratigraphy, sedimentary systems, and paleoceanography of the DWBC, ACC, and related water masses and fronts. The sites comprised a transect of water depths from 396 to 4488 m and spanned a latitudinal range from 39 ° to 51 °S. Leg 181 drilling provided the data needed to study a wide range of problems in the Southern Ocean Neogene. Driven by rifting and a new cycle of seafloor spreading along the Mid-Pacific Rise, New Zealand's youngest (Kaikoura) stratigraphic cycle begins with Late Cretaceous rift fill followed by subsidence and marine transgression until the late Eocene. Biopelagic oozes accumulated throughout as an abyssal apron around the Pacific perimeter of the New Zealand Plateau, seen as Paleocene siliceous nannofossil chalk, chert, and clay at Site 1121 (water depth = 4488 m) and nannofossil chalk at Site 1124 (water depth = 3967 m). At the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (33. 7 Ma), the spreading ridge between Australia and Antarctica broke through south of the Tasman Rise, linking {{for the first time the}} Indian and Pacific Oceans into a continuous Southern Ocean. Powerful wind-forced currents, predecessors to the modern ACC, were funneled through the Tasmanian Gateway and into the Pacific, where their path, combined with that of the thermohaline DWBC, was impeded by the shallowly submergent New Zealand Plateau, centered then at latitude 55 °S. All drill sites within or east of the Tasmanian Gateway and all onland sections in New Zealand record this event as a regional unconformity, the Marshall Paraconformity, across which a there is a time gap of 3 - 10 m. y., a result of a combination of corrosion, erosion, and nondeposition. Above the paraconformity, sedimentation in both shallow and deep water resumed as late Oligocene (27 - 29 Ma) sediment drifts (Site 1124; water depth = 3967 m). Younger deepwater drifts at Sites 1123 (water depth = 3290 m) and 1124 comprise alternating nannofossil chalks containing greater or lesser amounts of terrigenous clay. At Site 1123 on the North Chatham Drift, sediment accumulated essentially continuously from 20. 5 Ma onward. Analysis of this record shows that the stratigraphic rhythms there correspond to 41 -k. y. Milankovitch climatic cycles, with faster DWBC flow during colder or glacial intervals. Site 1123 is globally unique. It provides an essentially complete, richly microfossiliferous Miocene to Quaternary record of uniform 4 -cm/k. y. sedimentation that has been astronomically tuned. It also contains an almost complete paleomagnetic record since Chron C 6 r at 20. 5 Ma, including the first record of new magnetic subchron C 5 ADn 1 r. Shallower-water Sites 1125 (water depth = 1366 m), 1120 (water depth = 546 m), and 1119 (water depth = 396 m) reveal, respectively, a major productivity bloom between 5. 6 and 4. 8 Ma on the north side of the Subtropical Front (STF) (Site 1125), foraminiferal nannofossil chalk accumulation punctuated by paraconformities at 16. 7 - 15. 8, 5. 6 - 1. 9, and 0. 9 - 0. 24 Ma (Site 1120), and enhanced frontal flows along a seaward-relocated STF during glaciations (Site 1119). The late Quaternary climatic record at Site 1119 also closely matches that of air temperature in the Vostok ice core, indicating close links between climate change in southern middle and polar latitudes. From 24 Ma onward, abundant terrigenous material was shed into the southwest Pacific from rising mountains along the South Island Alpine Fault plate boundary. Gradually changing clay mineral assemblages in DWBC drifts, with chlorite + illite replacing smectite + kaolinite, reflect the increasing influence of newly unroofed basement (Rangitata) graywackes and schists through the Miocene-Quaternary. From 12 Ma onward, sediments were augmented by an influx of mainly rhyolitic tephra from the North Island volcanic arc. Site 1122 (water depth = 4432 m), on the left bank levee of the abyssal Bounty Fan, records a marked increase in the input of terrigenous turbidites and fan building starting at 1. 7 Ma and peaking at average rates > 50 cm/k. y. after 0. 7 Ma. Site 1124, on the Rekohu Drift near the Hikurangi Channel, records the start of overbank turbidite deposition, and therefore avulsion of the Hikurangi Channel from the Hikurangi Trough following <b>channel</b> <b>deflection</b> by a large submarine landslide from the North Island continental margin at 1. 65 Ma. Geological and oceanographic events that have occurred in the southwest Pacific since the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (33. 7 Ma) together compose the Eastern New Zealand Sedimentary System (ENZOSS), studies of which are contributing to our understanding of the history of global ocean circulation and climate change...|$|R
