500|$|In later life, Shostakovich {{suffered}} from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he {{suffered from}} a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 {{he wrote in a}} letter: [...] "Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Taylor, {{director}} of the animal rights group Animal Aid, called for an outright ban of the Grand National, saying: [...] "It's a deliberately hazardous, challenging and predictably lethal event." [...] The RSPCA's equine consultant David Muir stated: [...] "I was gutted that two horses died... What I will <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> go back {{and have a look}} at each element, with the BHA and the racecourse management, to see if the jump contributed to what happened, look at the take-off and landing side and so on, and see if the evidence suggests something can be done about it. I'm trying to make the race better, safer where I can, but the one thing I can never do is eliminate risk: that's always going to be there." [...] Muir did however add: [...] "There's no way I'm going to get the National banned." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{impact was}} a {{substantial}} news event reported and discussed online, in print, and on television. There {{was a genuine}} suspense because experts held widely differing opinions over {{the result of the}} impact. Various experts debated whether the impactor would go straight through the comet and out the other side, would create an impact crater, would open up a hole in the interior of the comet, and other theories. However, twenty-four hours before impact, the flight team at JPL began privately expressing a high level of confidence that, barring any unforeseen technical glitches, the spacecraft would intercept Tempel 1. One senior personnel member stated [...] "All we can <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> sit back and wait. Everything we can technically do to ensure impact has been done." [...] In the final minutes as the impactor hit the comet, more than 10,000 people watched the collision on a giant movie screen at Hawaii's Waikiki Beach.|$|E
500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{called the}} episode [...] "a decent" [...] and [...] "moderately sharp" [...] season premiere. He {{concluded}} that, [...] "While the episode still wasn't {{on par with}} those of the show's earliest seasons, ... The episode wasn't lazy—and for The Office, that's a win." [...] Other reviews were slightly more mixed. TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode a three out of five, but was appreciative of the additions to the cast, as well as many of the actors story lines. Jeffrey Hyatt of Screencrave noted that the episode was similar in tone to the season eight finale, [...] "Free Family Portrait Studio", but that [...] "the addition of Lacy and Duke pay quick dividends as the opener provides flashes of comedy moxie, while helping wash away painful memories of last season." [...] David Hinckley of the New York Daily News awarded the episode three stars out of five and wrote that [...] "The deadpan goofiness remains fresh enough to keep fans interested" [...] and that [...] "the fact that this whole drama doesn't feel new and shiny anymore isn't anyone's fault. ... All The Office needs to <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> march out proudly random, zany and off-center." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall, however, was critical of the episode's humor, noting that it [...] "didn't give me a lot of hope for a last-minute resurgence". Matt Roush of TV Guide wrote that the [...] "one interesting storyline" [...] may make him watch the remainder of Pam and Jim's story, but not [...] "the rest of this sadly played-out workplace comedy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2011, Murphy {{discussed}} a possible fourth film, stating, [...] "They're not doing it. What I'm trying to <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> produce a TV show starring Axel Foley's son, and Axel {{is the chief}} of police now in Detroit. I'd do the pilot, show up here and there. None of the movie scripts were right; it was trying to force the premise. If you have to force something, you shouldn't be doing it. It was always a rehash of the old thing. It was always wrong." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song {{is about}} a man who wonders what his former lover is {{currently}} doing and what her whereabouts are ("last I heard she had moved to Boulder"). While the singer has no idea what she <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>now,</b> he proclaims [...] "what she's <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> tearing him apart".|$|R
6000|$|Courthorne nodded. [...] "That is direct," [...] he said. [...] "One {{knows where}} he is when he deals {{with a man who}} talks as you <b>do.</b> <b>Now,</b> <b>are</b> you not curious as to the way I cheated both the river and the police?" ...|$|R
60|$|Such a {{statement}} would have aroused any ordinary woman, but Mrs. Stanhope {{appeared to be}} completely in Josiah Crabtree's power, and all she <b>did</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> to draw a long sigh and then wipe away a tear which stole down her pallid face.|$|R
2500|$|The first CIA Director, Vice Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, {{stated in}} a signed {{statement}} to Congress, also {{reported in the}} New York Times, February 28, 1960, [...] "It {{is time for the}} truth to be brought out... Behind the scenes high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about the UFOs. However, through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense... I urge immediate Congressional action to reduce the dangers from secrecy about unidentified flying objects." [...] In 1962, in his letter of resignation from NICAP, he told director Donald Keyhoe, [...] "I know the UFOs are not U.S. or Soviet devices. All we can <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> wait for some actions by the UFOs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roh's {{characteristically}} self-righteous stance {{resulted in}} harsh {{condemnation of the}} ex-President for hypocrisy. In response to the pervasive criticism upon Roh's bribery charges, he stated on his website, [...] "I have lost my moral cause just with the facts I have so far admitted. The only thing left is the legal procedure". Roh further added, [...] "What I have to <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> bow to the nation and apologize. From now on, the name Roh cannot be {{a symbol of the}} values you pursue. I'm no longer qualified to speak about democracy and justice.... You should abandon me." [...] Despite these appeals, Roh continued to deny all knowledge of the receipt of money by his family from Park Yeon-Cha, in contradiction to Park's testimony. Roh refused cross-examination with Park.|$|E
2500|$|Knight {{declared}} in his closing {{that the prosecution}} was not avenging what the defendants had done to Price. [...] "What {{has been done to}} her cannot be undone. What you can <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> {{to make sure that it}} doesn't happen to some other woman." [...] Leibowitz objected that the argument was [...] "an appeal to passion and prejudice" [...] and moved for a mistrial. Knight agreed that it was an appeal to passion, and Callahan overruled the motion. Knight continued, [...] "We all have a passion, all men in this court room to protect the womanhood in Alabama." [...] For his summation, solicitor Wade Wright reviewed the testimony and warned the jury, [...] "that this crime could have happened to any woman, even though she was riding in a parlor car, instead of box car." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are we to {{sink the}} cutter, sir?" [...] said the gunner, now {{advancing}} towards Captain Paul. [...] "If it <b>is</b> to <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> the time.

2500|$|In October 2014, {{she took}} a public stand against cyberbullying, calling herself [...] "patient zero" [...] of online harassment. Speaking at a Forbes {{magazine}} [...] "30 Under 30" [...] summit about her experiences {{in the aftermath of}} the scandal, she said, [...] "Having survived myself, what I want to <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> help other victims of the shame game survive, too." [...] She said she was influenced by reading about the suicide of Tyler Clementi, a Rutgers University freshman, involving cyberbullying and joined Twitter to facilitate her efforts. In March 2015, Lewinsky continued to speak out publicly against cyberbullying, delivering a TED talk calling for a more compassionate Internet. In June 2015, she became an ambassador and strategic advisor for anti-bullying organization Bystander Revolution. The same month, she gave an anti-cyberbullying speech at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. In September 2015, Lewinsky was interviewed by Amy Robach on Good Morning America, about Bystander Revolution's Month of Action campaign for National Bullying Prevention Month. [...] Lewinsky wrote the foreword to an October 2017 book by Sue Scheff and Melissa Schorr, Shame Nation: The Global Epidemic of Online Hate.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2013 {{interview}} with Martha Raddatz of ABC News, Greenwald said {{that members of}} Congress are being [...] "blocked" [...] from getting [...] "the most basic information about what NSA is doing... and what the FISA court has been doing....", and specifically referenced Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), a ranking member of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ("House Intelligence Committee"). Ruppersberger, who was a guest on the show, responded, [...] "We have rules {{as far as the}} committee and what you can have and what you cannot have. However, based on that, that statement I just made, is that since this incident occurred with Snowden, we've had three different hearings for members of our Democratic Caucus, and the Republican Caucus.... And we will continue to do that because what we're trying to <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> to get the American public to know more about what's going on." [...] Rep. King, who was also a guest on This Week as a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, stated: [...] "o me it's unprecedented to have all of these top people from an administration during this time of crisis still come in and answer question after question after question. So anyone who says that Congress is somehow being stonewalled is just wrong and [...] is generally, I think, raised by {{people who are trying to}} make a name for themselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album Music from Big Pink, in particular, is {{credited}} with contributing to Clapton's decision to leave the supergroup Cream. In his introduction of The Band during the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Concert, Clapton announced that in 1968 {{he had heard the}} album, [...] "and it changed my life." [...] Nazareth took their name from [...] "The Weight" [...] - taken from the line [...] "I pulled into Nazareth, feeling half past dead" [...] Guitarist Richard Thompson has acknowledged the album's influence on Fairport Convention's Liege and Lief, and journalist John Harris has suggested that The Band's debut also influenced the spirit of The Beatles' back-to-basics album Let It Be as well as the Rolling Stones' string of roots-infused albums that began with Beggars Banquet. George Harrison said that his song [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] was heavily influenced by the Band and that, while writing the song, he imagined Levon Helm singing it. Meanwhile, the Big Pink song [...] "The Weight" [...] has been covered numerous times, and in various musical styles. In a 1969 interview, Robbie Robertson remarked on the group's influence, [...] "We certainly didn't want everybody {{to go out and get}} a banjo and a fiddle player. We were trying to calm things down a bit though. What we're going to <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> go to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and record four sides, four psychedelic songs. Total freak-me songs. Just to show that we have no hard feelings. Just pretty good rock and roll." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 1810 By now {{ideas of}} {{connecting}} Leicester to Northampton seemed pointless.

500|$|Regarding his {{personal}} life, Paul Oscar has said: [...] "I {{have a lot}} of work still to do. I have had three relationships that, from the outside, looked picture perfect, I suppose. But they were actually quite rotten and false, abusive to me. What I <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> learning to fall in love with myself." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{cycle of}} the feminization of poverty in the Dominican Republic {{is a direct result}} of {{cultural}} biases and systematic oppression. Dominican women make generally forty-four cents on the dollar as compared to men. This wage gap often leads to a high level of food insecurity among women in the Dominican Republic. Food insecurity often leads to an increased rate of dangerous behaviors such as unprotected sex and drug use. These behaviors put women at a greater risk for contracting HIV. There is a grand stigma around HIV positive women in the Dominican Republic. For this reason, women are more likely to be subjected to health screenings when applying for a job. If the screening reveals that a women is HIV positive, then they are almost guaranteed to be denied any position. Unemployment furthers the issue of food insecurity and because the HIV stigma is so prevalent in that culture, women are often ostracized from their families and forced to fend for themselves with no job prospects or support. One woman's doctor told her upon announcing her diagnosis, [...] "What you have to <b>do</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> die," [...] because he realized the severity of the cultural implication of the news. HIV positive women are also more likely to suffer domestic abuse. Children of HIV positive women are also affected. One women shared the story of her sister refusing to adopt her child when she was unable to provide for him after her diagnosis because the sister was afraid the child was tainted by virtue of his mother having the disease. The cycle runs deep of women suffering from HIV and therefore poverty within the country and the stigma disenfranchises citizens from wanting to address the problem.|$|E
