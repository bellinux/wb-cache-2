50|$|CSDs {{are mainly}} used on {{airliner}} and military aircraft jet engines {{to drive the}} alternating current (AC) electrical generator. In order to produce the proper voltage at a constant AC frequency, usually three-phase 115 VAC at 400 Hz, a generator needs to spin at a constant specific speed (typically 6,000 RPM for air-cooled generators). Since the jet engine gearbox speed varies from idle to full power, this creates {{the need for a}} constant speed drive (CSD). The CSD takes the variable speed output of the accessory <b>drive</b> <b>gearbox</b> and hydro-mechanically produces a constant output RPM.|$|E

5000|$|With power {{typically}} {{being the}} product of force and speed, a motorcycle's power and torque ratings will be highly indicative of its performance. Reported numbers for power and torque may however vary from one source to another due to inconsistencies in how testing equipment is calibrated, the method of using that equipment, the conditions during the test, and particularly the location that force and speed are being measured at. [...] The power of the engine alone, often called crankshaft power, or power at the crankshaft, will be significantly greater than the power measured at the rear wheel. The amount of power lost due to friction in the transmission (primary <b>drive,</b> <b>gearbox</b> and final drive) depends {{on the details of}} the design and construction. Generalizing, a chain drive motorcycle may have some 5-20% less power at the rear wheel than at the crankshaft, while a shaft drive model may lose a little more than that due to greater friction.|$|E

In this paper, a fault diagnosis method using bispectrum and bispectrum entropy as the fault feature parameters is put forward. Bispectrum entropy as the information entropy in bispectrum domain can reflect the complexity of information energy. When the structure is failed, the distribution of bispectrum will be changed. bispectrum entropy can reflect this change and achieve good separation of {{the different types of}} fault.

40|$|Final design {{details of}} a {{helicopter}} transmission that is powered by GE twin T 700 engines each rated at 1800 hp are presented. It is demonstrated that in comparison with conventional helicopter transmission arrangements the split torque design offers: weight reduction of 15 %; reduction in drive train losses of 9 %; and improved reliability resulting from redundant drive paths between the two engines and the main shaft. The transmission fits within the NASA LeRC 3000 hp Test Stand and accepts the existing positions for engine inputs, main shaft, connecting drive shafts, and the cradle attachment points. One necessary change to the test stand involved gear trains of different ratio in the tail <b>drive</b> <b>gearbox.</b> Progressive uprating of engine input power from 3600 to 4500 hp twin engine rating is allowed for in the design.

40|$|Technical work on {{the design}} and effort leading to the testing of a 74. 5 kW (100 hp) {{automotive}} gas turbine is described. The general effort was concentrated on building an engine for test starting in July. The buildup progressed with only routine problems and the engine was delivered to the test stand 9 July. In addition to the engine build effort, work continued in selected component areas. Ceramic turbine parts were built and tested. Burst tests of ceramic rotors show strengths are approaching that achieved in test bars; proof testing is required for acceptable strength ceramic vanes. Over 25 hours was accumulated on the combustor rig in three test modes: pilot nozzle only, start nozzle, and main nozzle operation. Satisfactory ignition was achieved {{for a wide range}} of starting speeds and the lean blowout limit was as low as 0. 06 kg/b (0. 14 lb/hr). Lean blowout was more a function of nozzle atomization than fuel/air ratio. A variety of cycle points were tested. Transition from start nozzle flow to main nozzle flow was done manually without difficulty. Regenerator parts were qualification tested without incident and the parts were assembled on schedule.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the current civil engine design {{practice}} of increasing overall pressure ratio, turbine entry temperature and bypass ratio, and on the technologies {{required in order to}} sustain it. In this context, this thesis contributes towards clarifying the following gray aspects of future civil engine development: the connection between an aircraft application, the engine thermodynamic cycle and the advanced technologies of variable area fan nozzle and fan <b>drive</b> <b>gearbox.</b> the connection between the engine thermodynamic cycle and the fuel consumption penalties of extracting bleed or power in order to satisfy the aircraft needs. the scaling of propeller maps in order to enable extensive open-rotor studies similar to the ones carried out for turbofan engines. The rst two objectives are tackled by implementing a preliminary design framework, which comprises models that calculate the engine uninstalled performance, dimensions, weight, drag and installed performance. The framework produces designs that are in good agreement with current and near future civil engines. The need for a variable area fan nozzle is related to the fan surge margin at take-o, while the transition to a geared architecture is identi ed by tracking the variation of the low pressure turbine number of stages. The results show that the above enabling technologies will be prioritised for long range engines, due to their higher overall pressure ratio, higher bypass ratio and lower speci c thrust. The analysis also shows that future lower speci c thrust engines will su er from higher secondary power extraction penalties. A propeller modelling and optimisation method is created in order to accomplish the open-rotor aspect of this work. The propeller model follows the lifting-line approach and is found to perform well against experimental data available for the SR 3 prop-fan. The model is used in order to predict the performance of propellers with the same distribution of airfoils and sweep, but with di erent design point power coe cient and advance ratio. The results demonstrate that all the investigated propellers can be modelled by a common map, which separately determines the ideal and viscous losses...|$|E
40|$|A {{spinal cord}} injury {{severely}} reduces {{the quality of life}} of affected people. Following the injury, limitations of the ability to move may occur due to the disruption of the motor and sensory functions of the nervous system depending on the severity of the lesion. An active stance-control knee-ankle-foot orthosis was developed and tested in earlier works to aid incomplete SCI subjects by increasing their mobility and independence. This thesis aims at the incorporation of elastic actuation into the active orthosis to utilise advantages of the compliant system regarding efficiency and human-robot interaction as well as the reproduction of the phyisological compliance of the human joints. Therefore, a model-based procedure is adapted to the design of an elastic actuation system for a gait-assisitve active orthosis. A determination of the optimal structure and parameters is undertaken via optimisation of models representing compliant actuators with increasing level of detail. The minimisation of the energy calculated from the positive amount of power or from the absolute power of the actuator generating one human-like gait cycle yields an optimal series stiffness, which is similar to the physiological stiffness of the human knee during the stance phase. Including efficiency factors for components, especially the consideration of the electric model of an electric motor yields additional information. A human-like gait cycle contains high torque and low velocities in the stance phase and lower torque combined with high velocities during the swing. Hence, the efficiency of an electric motor with a gear unit is only high in one of the phases. This yields a conceptual design of a series elastic actuator with locking of the actuator position during the stance phase. The locked position combined with the series compliance allows a reproduction of the characteristics of the human gait cycle during the stance phase. Unlocking the actuator position for the swing phase enables the selection of an optimal gear ratio to maximise the recuperable energy. To evaluate the developed concept, a laboratory specimen based on an electric motor, a harmonic <b>drive</b> <b>gearbox,</b> a torsional series spring and an electromagnetic brake is designed and appropriate components are selected. A control strategy, based on impedance control, is investigated and extended with a finite state machine to activate the locking mechanism. The control scheme and the laboratory specimen are implemented at a test bench, modelling the foot and shank as a pendulum articulated at the knee. An identification of parameters yields high and nonlinear friction as a problem of the system, which reduces the energy efficiency of the system and requires appropriate compensation. A comparison between direct and elastic actuation shows similar results for both systems at the test bench, showing that the increased complexity due to the second degree of freedom and the elastic behaviour of the actuator is treated properly. The final proof of concept requires the implementation at the active orthosis to emulate uncertainties and variations occurring during the human gait...|$|E
