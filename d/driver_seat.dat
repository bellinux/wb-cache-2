5|$|The game offers four {{different}} difficulty settings and includes online leaderboards which enumerate high scores that different players have achieved for the game. The game is segmented into protecting six different villages, and each village is broken up into four levels: a Day level, a Boss level, a Night level, and a bonus level. Levels are further broken into waves as increasingly difficult enemies attack the village. The bonus level drops the top-down camera view and is played {{from the perspective}} of the <b>driver</b> <b>seat</b> of the car. Boss levels confront the player with a boss enemy that is much stronger than the other enemies encountered in the game. Each boss requires the player to discover and employ a predefined strategy in order to defeat them. For example, the first boss is a giant steamroller with an attached flamethrower that can not be damaged by the car's regular guns and instead requires the use of napalm to destroy it.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn ergonomically {{designed}} <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> {{is crucial in}} ensuring quality, comfort and safe driving. The increase in road accidents every year is mostly linked to drivers’ fatigue. Therefore, posture comfort is an important aspect in <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> design. The {{aim of this study}} is to design a <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> which is suitable for Malaysians. There are three main objectives in this study; firstly, to investigates the comfort level and safety system of the existing <b>driver's</b> <b>seat,</b> secondly, to identify and determine parameters which may affect comfort and the <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> safety system, and lastly, to develop and design an ergonomic <b>driver's</b> <b>seat.</b> Anthropometric data of drivers should be used during the <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> design stage. Critical dimensions of the <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> and anthropometric data must be taken into consideration in order to optimize the comfort level and safety of the seat. Previous studies showed that the evaluation of <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> discomfort should include both objective and subjective evaluations. The seat discomfort will negatively affect the driver's performance. All information pertaining to the <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> design was obtained through research on the related subjects. In the data collection phase, the objective evaluation method was used in determining the seat's dimension while subjective evaluation was used to gather information on the drivers’ experience. Anthropometric data from 1405 male and female subjects were collected and stored in a database. Meanwhile, subjective evaluation on <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> discomfort was conducted on 100 male and female respondents. The SPSS software was used to analyse the data. Every parameter that affects the safety and comfort of the <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> were then used to design a new <b>driver's</b> <b>seat.</b> The parameters that were taken into account are backrest height, cushion width, cushion length and adjustability. These parameters were then matched with the Malaysian drivers’ anthropometric data. Finally, the dimensions of the new <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> were determined: 520 mm cushion width; 380 mm cushion length, 480 mm backrest width, 407. 5 mm backrest height and 180 mm adjustability...|$|R

2500|$|The Fleetwood {{departed}} the front-drive lineup for 1993 (as the Fleetwood name {{went on the}} new rear-drive {{replacement for}} the 1992 Brougham). Sixty Special continued in its front-wheel drive form, as it had since it was reintroduced in 1987, but {{this would be the}} last year. To visually differentiate the 1989–1993 DeVille from the upper-rung Fleetwood and Sixty-Special models, the front-drive Fleetwoods and Sixty Specials use fender-mounted [...] "spats" [...] or skirts over the rear wheels, while DeVille had full rear-wheel openings. For its final-year, there were 5,292 Sixty Specials built in 1993, including 688 with the optional [...] "Ultra" [...] Package that featured 22-way adjustable front seats, designed in Italy by Giorgio Guigiaro. This distinctive seating package had been standard on the Sixty Special since 1989, but in 1993, it became a $3,550.00 option. While it was based upon the DeVille, the Sixty Special included eleven items as standard equipment, while those eleven items were optional at extra cost on DeVilles, and in addition there were options for the Sixty Special, that were not available on the DeVille, such as [...] "Memory Seat" [...] for driver with two recall settings, an [...] "Exit" [...] button" [...] when pushed automatically powered the <b>driver</b> <b>seat</b> all the way rearward, and dual front seat power recliners.

2500|$|Although NASCAR {{frequently}} publicizes {{the safety}} measures it mandates for drivers, these features are often only adopted {{long after they}} were initially developed, and only {{in response to an}} injury or fatality. The impact-absorbing [...] "SAFER Barrier" [...] that is now in use had been proposed by legendary mechanic Smokey Yunick during the 1970s, but his idea had been dismissed as too expensive and unnecessary. Only after the deaths of Adam Petty, Kenny Irwin and Tony Roper in 2000, and Dale Earnhardt in 2001 did NASCAR revisit the idea of decreasing the G-forces a driver sustained during a crash. Other examples of available safety features that were slow to be implemented include the mandating of a throttle [...] "kill switch". The [...] "kill switch" [...] was mandated after the death of Adam Petty, along with the requirements of an anti-spill bladder in fuel cells. Fire-retardant driver suits were required only after the death of Glen [...] "Fireball" [...] Roberts, who died from complications of burns suffered in a crash when flames engulfed his car during a Charlotte race. Dale Earnhardt was killed after he received massive head and neck trauma from a hard crash in the 2001 Daytona 500. Earnhardt's death prompted NASCAR to require all drivers to use the [...] "HANS device" [...] (Head And Neck Support Device), a device that keeps the driver's neck from going forward in a wreck.
