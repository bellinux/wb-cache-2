5|$|When meeting {{another of}} the same species, P. fimbriata does not use cryptic {{stalking}} but displays by moving quickly and smoothly. In P. fimbriata from Queensland, contests between males usually are very brief and do no damage. Contests between Portia females are usually long and violent, and the victor may evict a loser and then eat the loser's eggs – but victorious <b>females</b> <b>of</b> P. fimbriata from Queensland do not kill and eat the losing female. If a P. fimbriata male from Queensland displays to a female, she may run away or she may charge at him. If the pair reach agreement after this, they will copulate if she is mature, and if she is sub-adult he will cohabit in her nest until she finishes moulting, and then they copulate. P. fimbriata typically copulates much quicker than other jumping spiders. Unlike in other Portia species, <b>females</b> <b>of</b> P. fimbriata do not eat their mates during courting, nor during or after copulation.|$|E
5|$|Although males {{demonstrate}} little {{involvement in}} territorial disputes between neighboring communities, and ruffed lemur communities lack cohesiveness, females communally defend the community range against <b>females</b> <b>of</b> other communities.

Spacing is maintained by scent marking and vocal communication. Ruffed lemurs {{are known for their}} loud, raucous calls that are answered by neighboring communities and subgroups within the same community.|$|E
5|$|Andreacarus voalavo is a {{parasitic}} mite {{found on}} the Malagasy rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus.

The length of the idiosoma, the main body, is 630 to 670μm in females and 450 to 480μm in males. Unlike A.eliurus, this species lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between two lyrifissures (sensory organs) on {{the lower part of the}} female body. The pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the chelicera, is serrate, which distinguishes it from A.gymnuromys. <b>Females</b> <b>of</b> A.gymnuromys also have a less ornamented sternal shield (covering part of the underparts) and shorter setae (bristles) on the upperparts.|$|E
