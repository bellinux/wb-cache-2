5|$|Lurgan {{sits in a}} {{relatively}} <b>flat</b> <b>part</b> of Ireland by the south east shore of Lough Neagh. The two main formations in north Armagh are an area of estuarine clays by {{the shore of the}} lough, and a mass of basalt farther back. The earliest human settlements in the area were to the northwest of the present day town near the shore of the lough. When the land was handed to the Brownlow family, they initially settled near the lough at Annaloist, but later settled where the town was eventually built. The oldest part of the town, the main street, is built on a long ridge in the townland (baile fearainn) of Lurgan. A neighbouring hill is the site of Brownlow House, which overlooks Lurgan Park.|$|E

2500|$|Spade bits {{are used}} for rough boring in wood. They tend to cause {{splintering}} when they emerge from the workpiece. [...] Woodworkers avoid splintering by finishing the hole from {{the opposite side of}} the work. [...] Spade bits are flat, with a centering point and two cutters. The cutters are often equipped with spurs in an attempt to ensure a cleaner hole. With their small shank diameters relative to their boring diameters, spade bit shanks often have flats forged or ground into them to prevent slipping in drill chucks. Some bits are equipped with long shanks and have a small hole drilled through the <b>flat</b> <b>part,</b> allowing them to be used much like a bell-hanger bit. Intended for high speed use, they are used with electric hand drills. Spade bits are also sometimes referred to as [...] "paddle bits".|$|E
2500|$|For audio lines, it is {{invariably}} {{necessary to}} combine L/C filter components with resistive attenuator {{components in the}} same filter section. [...] The {{reason for this is}} that the usual design strategy is to require the section to attenuate all frequencies down to the level of the frequency in the passband with the lowest level. [...] Without the resistor components, the filter, at least in theory, would increase attenuation without limit. [...] The attenuation in the stop band of the filter (that is, the limiting maximum attenuation) is referred to as the [...] "basic loss" [...] of the section. [...] In other words, the <b>flat</b> <b>part</b> of the band is attenuated by the basic loss down to the level of the falling part of the band which it is desired to equalise. [...] The following discussion of practical sections relates in particular to audio transmission lines.|$|E
2500|$|A typical {{complete}} filter {{will consist of}} a number of Zobel sections for roll-off, frequency dips and temperature followed by a flat attenuator section to bring the level down to a standard attenuation. [...] This is followed by a fixed gain amplifier to bring the signal back up to a usable level, typically 0dBu. [...] The gain of the amplifier is usually no more than 45dB maximum. [...] Any more and the amplification of line noise will tend to cancel out the quality benefits of improved bandwidth. [...] This limit on amplification essentially limits how much the bandwidth can be increased by these techniques. [...] It {{should also be noted that}} no one part of the incoming signal band will be amplified by the full 45dB. [...] The 45dB is made up of the line loss in the <b>flat</b> <b>part</b> of its spectrum plus the basic loss of each section. [...] In general, each section will be minimum loss at a different frequency band, hence the amplification in that band will be limited to the basic loss of just that one filter section, assuming insignificant overlap. [...] A typical choice for R0 is 600Î©. [...] A good quality transformer (usually essential, but not shown on the diagram), known as a repeating coil, is at the beginning of the chain where the line terminates.|$|E

Cut out a piece of strong paper roughly into the shape of this Arethusan leaf, a, Fig. 21. Now suppose the next young leaf has to spring out of the front of this one, at about the middle of its height. Give it two nicks with the scissors at b b; then roll up the lower part into a cylinder, (it will overlap a good deal at the bottom,) and tie it fast with a fine thread: so, you will get the form at c. Then bend the top of it back, so that, seen sideways, it appears as at d, and you see you have made quite a little flower-pot to plant your {158} new leaf in, and perhaps it may occur to you that you have seen something like this before.

6000|$|... Â§ 6. And here, {{to prevent}} the notion of {{differentia}} from being restricted within too narrow limits, {{it is necessary to}} remark, that a species, even as referred to the same genus, will not always have the same differentia, but a different one, according to the principle and purpose which preside over the particular classification. For example, a naturalist surveys the various kinds of animals, and looks out for the classification of them most in accordance with the order in which, for zoological purposes, he considers it desirable that we should think of them. With this view he finds it advisable that one of his fundamental divisions should be into warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals; or into animals which breathe with lungs and those which breathe with gills; or into carnivorous, and frugivorous or graminivorous; or into those which walk on the <b>flat</b> <b>part</b> and those which walk on the extremity of the foot, a distinction on which two of Cuvierâs families are founded. In doing this, the naturalist creates as many new classes; which are by no means those to which the individual animal is familiarly and spontaneously referred; nor should we ever think of assigning to them so prominent a position in our arrangement of the animal kingdom, unless for a preconceived purpose of scientific convenience. And to the liberty of doing this there is no limit. In the examples we have given, most of the classes are real Kinds, since each of the peculiarities is an index to a multitude of properties belonging to the class which it characterizes: but even if the case were otherwiseâif the other properties of those classes could all be derived, by any process known to us, from the one peculiarity on which the class is foundedâeven then, if these derivative properties were of primary importance {{for the purposes of the}} naturalist, he would be warranted in founding his primary divisions on them.|$|E
