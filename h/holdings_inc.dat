Ron Perelman of Forbes <b>Holdings</b> <b>Inc.</b> bought a 37.5 percent share of Guthy-Renker in 1993 in exchange for $25 million and priority access to air-time on Perelman's television stations. At the time, Guthy-Renker had grown to $60 million in revenue. In 1996, Perelman's stake in the company was resold to News Corp and Guthy-Renker bought it back. Two years later, Goldman Sachs bought a stake in the company that valued Guthy-Renker at $3 billion, and a Japanese trading company, Nissho Iwai Group, bought a 17 percent portion of Guthy-Renker's Asia subsidiary for $9 million. Guthy-Renker created a television station for infomercials called GRTV in 1996, which was sold to TVN Entertainment Corporation in 1999.|$|E
