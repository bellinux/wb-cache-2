40|$|High quality grain - {{a pledge}} of his safety, reduce losses {{and the costs}} of storage. Wheat is the main source of human nutrition. Elements {{contained}} in wheat perform a fundamental role in human life. Storing grain quality is an urgent task. One of the labor-intensive operations in this process is the correct placement of parties in wheat granary and timely monitoring of key parameters (humidity and temperature). In this regard, we consider methods for determining the intensity of the grain breathing method for determining the moisture content and temperature of the grain of wheat. Humidity was determined by <b>electrical</b> <b>hygrometer.</b> To measure the temperature of wheat used mercury thermometer. In analyzing the breathing wheat energy depending on the humidity {{it was found that the}} intensity of respiration increasingly affects humidity increase than an increase in temperature. As objects of study used wheat varieties: Hordeiforme 432 and Multiroom 321. According to the results obtained in the study plot the respiratory activity of the grain from moisture. According to the schedules we concluded that the sharp increase in wheat breathing energy occurs with increasing moisture content to a value of more than 15 %. Just found out that in addition to breathing in highly humid grain appears vital functions of harmful microorganisms, which under the influence of grain rots and becomes stale. Thus, ho-well-organized and skilled observation, the correct analysis of the obtained data allow to bring the maximum reduction in spending of dry matter and therefore achieve lower grain weight loss during storage...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} and {{preliminary testing}} {{of a low}} cost, remote-sensing air-bornc, double bolometer technique for inferring atmospheric water vapor is illustrated. To deduce the water vapor profile with commercially available equipment, the radiative transfer equation is solved for the water vapor transmissivity employing an input data remote radiometer-measured upward irradiances obtained at aircraft holding levels. Radiometcrs sensitivc in two separatc spectral bands are used. The primary radiometer covers the 4. 39 to 20. 83 p, broad atmospheric radiation band, and the second, for surface temperature dcduction, covers the atmospheric window region, 7. 35 to 13. 16 ~. The transfer solution results are acquired from computer programs developed specifically for this purpose. Results indicate an accuracy for inferred total tropospheric water vapor and mixing ratio profiles close {{to that of the}} standard sounding <b>electrical</b> <b>hygrometer.</b> The absolute accuracy of the radiosonde hygrometer, considering surfacc calibration procedures, and for a single ascent, is not better than & 12 percent. The absolute accuracy is grcatest for “dry ” soundings where the largest changes in irradiance occur for givcn changes in moisturc. Specifically, tests for a vertical profile averaging 6. 00 gm. /kg. of water vapor produce an average error of 0. 70 gm. /kg. in the inferred mixing ratio. The average error in mixing ratio obtained by this technique for profiles avcraging 2. 3 gm. /kg. is 0. 05 gm. /kg. The implicatioi,s for use on high-flying aircraft or on rockets with highly sensitivc radiometers are obvious. The primary purpose in reporting this research is to suggcst a technique and illustrate its use. It is clear that with more sensitive bolometer radiometers with selective band pass filters a considerable increase in accuracy can be achieved. FT i,...|$|E
