5|$|From 1991 to 1992, Jashari {{and about}} 100 other <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> wishing {{to fight for}} the {{independence}} of Kosovo underwent military training in the municipality of Labinot-Mal in Albania. Afterwards, Jashari and other <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> committed several acts of sabotage aimed at the Serbian administrative apparatus in Kosovo. Attempting to capture or kill him, Serbian police surrounded Jashari and his older brother, Hamëz, at their home in Prekaz on 30 December 1991. In the ensuing siege, large numbers of Kosovo Albanians flocked to Prekaz, pressuring the police to withdraw from the village.|$|E

5|$|On April 27, nine of {{the fallen}} militants were buried in Erec. Some 400 <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> {{attended}} their funerals. The dead {{ranged in age from}} seventeen to forty-five years old. Villagers claimed that some of the dead had been arrested days before their deaths and thus could not have been ambushed, as the Yugoslav authorities claimed. Such claims could not be independently verified by Western reporters. In a 1998 report, Amnesty International affirmed that the 19 men had been killed in an ambush while trying to smuggle weapons into Kosovo.|$|E
5|$|Serb sources {{assert that}} the first mujahideen began {{arriving}} in Kosovo {{in the spring of}} 1998, mainly from Bosnia and Herzegovina. By that summer, about 240 mujahideen were present in Kosovo and northern Albania. Most of these were <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians,</b> but the group also included several dozen Arabs from the Middle East and North Africa. According to the diary of the ambushed KLA group's leader, Ali Rabiçi, the mujahideen involved in the July 18 ambush had initially gathered in Munich before taking a ferry from Bari to the Albanian port city of Durrës. Once in Albania, the mujahideen were escorted to the frontier towns of Tropojë and Bajram Curri by their KLA handlers, where they rendezvoused with Rabiçi's men.|$|E

5|$|Skopje, as the Republic of Macedonia as a whole, is characterised {{by a large}} ethnic diversity. The city {{is located}} in a region where <b>Ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> and Macedonians meet, and it welcomed Romani, Turks, Jews and Serbs {{throughout}} its history. Skopje was mainly a Muslim city until the 19th century, when large number of Christians started to settle there. According to the 2002 census, Macedonians were the largest ethnic group in Skopje, with 338,358 inhabitants, or 66.75% of the population. Then came Albanians with 103,891 inhabitants (20.49%), Roma people with 23,475 (4.63%), Serbs (14,298 inhabitants), Turks (8,595), Bosniaks (7,585) and Vlachs (2,557). 8,167 people did not belong to any of these groups.|$|E
5|$|Within hours, {{suspected}} KLA gunmen {{attacked a}} Serb-owned café in Peć, killing six unarmed Serb youths. Western diplomats suspected {{the attack was}} carried out in retaliation for the ambush, though the KLA denied responsibility. Several days later, Yugoslav authorities returned the bodies of all but three of the fallen militants following mediation by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The militants were given heroes' funerals in a rebel-held area, in a ceremony attended by thousands of <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians,</b> including other KLA fighters. In January 1999, the KLA abducted eight VJ personnel, who were later exchanged for the nine militants captured in the ambush.|$|E
5|$|Sources differ {{regarding}} the division's initial composition. Pavlowitch states that {{sixty percent of}} its recruits were Muslims and the rest were Yugoslav Volksdeutsche who made {{up the majority of}} its officers and NCOs. Tomasevich states that it was formed with 23,200 Muslims and 2,800 Croats, with mostly German officers. He further states it was the largest of the Muslim SS Divisions with 26,000 men. Lepre indicates that the division's prescribed strength was reduced from 26,000 to 21,000, and Cohen states that the division achieved a maximum strength of 17,000 in April 1944. The division had a Muslim Imam for each battalion other than the all-German signal battalion. For about six months the division included about 1,000 <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> from Kosovo and the Sandžak region who made up the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment, which later became the 1st Battalion of the 28th Regiment (I/28).|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} German {{troops and}} former naval personnel were reorganized as the regimental Kampfgruppe Skanderbeg {{under the command}} of SS-Obersturmbannführer Alfred Graaf. The unit withdrew from the Kosovo region in mid-November {{along with the rest of}} the German troops in the area. Many Serbs and Montenegrins then took revenge against the region's <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians,</b> especially collaborators and those who had been members of the division. When Kampfgruppe Skanderbeg reached Ljubovija on the Drina river, it was placed {{under the command of}} the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen, which was securing the river crossings in that area. The Kampfgruppe held the towns of Zvornik and Drinjača during the first half of December 1944 as part of the Ljubovija bridgehead. It withdrew across the Drina and fought its way north, towards Brčko on the Sava river, where it relieved the Wehrmacht forces holding the town. In late December, the Kampfgruppes assault gun battery was committed to the Syrmian Front at Vinkovci. The remainder of the Kampfgruppe was deployed to Bijeljina.|$|E
5|$|Albania {{remained}} {{occupied by}} Italy until its {{surrender to the}} Allies in September 1943. In August of that year, faced with the imminent collapse of the Italian war effort, Germany deployed the 2nd Panzer Army to the Balkans to take over areas previously occupied by Italy. One of the Italian areas seized by the Germans was Albania, where the XXI Mountain Corps of Generaloberst (General) Lothar Rendulic's 2nd Panzer Army had been deployed. A Wehrmacht plenipotentiary general, and a special representative of Heinrich Himmler, SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS und Polizei Josef Fitzthum, were both based in the Albanian capital of Tirana. The Germans took control of all Albanian forces that had been collaborating with the Italians prior to their capitulation, including the Balli Kombëtar, an anti-communist and nationalist militia. The Germans strengthened the Albanian army and gendarmerie, but quickly decided those troops were unreliable. That year, a number of Albanians from Kosovo and the Sandžak region were recruited into the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian), a Waffen-SS division composed largely of Bosnian Muslims and Croats with mostly German officers. For about six months the division included about 1,000 <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> from Kosovo and the Sandžak who made up the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment (I/2), which later became the 1st Battalion of the 28th Regiment (I/28). The division later recruited a further 500 men from the Sandžak.|$|E
25|$|The {{relations}} between Kosovo-Albanians and Serbs have been hostile since {{the rise of}} nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century. During Communism in Yugoslavia, the <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> and Serbs were strongly irreconcilable with sociological studies during the Tito-era indicating that <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> and Serbs rarely accepted each other as neighbours or friends and few held interethnic marriages. Ethnic prejudices, stereotypes and mutual distrust between <b>ethnic</b> <b>Albanians</b> and Serbs have remained common for decades. The level of intolerance and separation between both communities during the Tito-period was reported by sociologists to be worse than that of Croat and Serb communities in Yugoslavia which also had tensions but held some closer {{relations between}} each other.|$|E
