40|$|We {{performed}} {{a pilot study}} to compare the <b>digitized</b> <b>images</b> of panoramic radiographs with the original film images for perceived clarity and diagnostic quality, and to make comparison amongst the <b>digitized</b> film <b>images</b> captured by a digital camera at different resolution settings to assess if differences in clarity and/or diagnostic quality existed. Eight orthopantomograms were photographed using a digital camera, Nikon Finepix S 7000, at four different resolution settings - 1 M pix, 3 M pix, 6 M pix and 12 M pix respectively. These thirty two digital images were transferred to a laptop computer, Acer Travelmate 290 E, saved as JPEG files and viewed using ′Planmeca Dimaxis′ software. Five observers made comparison between the film and <b>digitized</b> <b>images</b> and also amongst the <b>images</b> <b>digitized</b> with various pixel strengths. Images were ranked for clarity and diagnostic quality. Data was analyzed using statistical tests.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for <b>image</b> <b>digitizing</b> in the Cartizian three dimension XYZ coordinates. It {{is defined as the}} displacement vector concept based on the hierarchical stereo vision technique depending on multi camera system, distributed around the tested object. Optical sensors without any mechanical parts under the control of a host computer with an integrated full automatic calibra-tion process are introduced. Problems of this automated style are in-vestigated. Different factors such as calibration, feature extraction, point to point correspondence, determination of cartizian coordinates, transformation into symbolic computer aided design form are includ-ed. Performance of the proposed system is analyzed and results of the application to a human foot model as a sample of testing are deter-mined. The execution time and effort are dramatically decreased with increased measured accuracy...|$|E

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} stress {{analysis}} procedure for concrete material using a real digital image {{to generate a}} geometrically accurate finite element model of coarse aggregates and mortar. After illustrating the <b>image</b> <b>digitizing</b> and processing procedure, we present a threedimensional linear analysis using the standard eight-node trilinear element of cubic shape. We also propose a mixed finite element that models cracks along the interfaces between coarse aggregates and mortar. These interfaces are defined by the digital sub-image embedded in the mixed element.

40|$|A recent {{potential}} of distributed image processing is discussed. Applications {{in the control}} of flexible spacecraft are emphasized. Devices are currently being developed at NASA and in universities and industries that allow the real-time processing of holographic images. Within 5 years, it is expected that, in real-time, one may add or subtract holographic images at optical accuracy. Images are stored and processed in crystal mediums. The accuracy of their storage and processing is dictated by the grating level of laser holograms. It is far greater than that achievable using current analog-to-digital, pixel oriented, <b>image</b> <b>digitizing</b> and computing techniques. Processors using image processing algebra can conceptually be designed to mechanize Fourier transforms, least square lattice filters, and other complex control system operations. Thus, actuator command inputs derived from complex control laws involving distributed holographic images can be generated by such an image processor. Plans are revealed {{for the development of}} a Conjugate Optics Processor for control of a flexible object...|$|E

40|$|We have {{determined}} the densities of Si in the liquid, rhol(T), and solid, rhos(T), {{states as a}} function of temperature, T, by employing an <b>image</b> <b>digitizing</b> technique and numerical calculation methods in combination with an electrostatic levitator. The obtained density data can be fitted with the following equations: rhol(T) = rhol(Tm) – 1. 71 × 10 ^– 4 (T – Tm) – 1. 61 × 10 ^– 7 (T – Tm) 2 (g/cm^ 3); rhos(T) = rhos(Tm) – 2. 63 × 10 ^– 5 (T – Tm) (g/cm^ 3),where Tm is the melting point, 1687 K, and rhol(Tm) and rhos(Tm) are 2. 580 and 2. 311 (g/cm^ 3), respectively. The error involved in the determination is estimated to be ± 0. 006 (g/cm 3). The rhol(T) value smoothly varies through Tm and does not indicate a reported anomalous density variation. The rhol(Tm) value is 2 % larger than the literature value and the coefficient of the linear temperature dependence is approximately half of a reported value.

40|$|A {{computer-assisted}} videodensitometry (CAV) {{method is}} presented for the microradiographical mineral determination and mineral visualization of in vitro and in vivo formed dentin lesions. The method employs as essential steps (1) <b>image</b> <b>digitizing</b> by a CCD camera, (2) conversion of gray values to equivalent aluminium thicknesses and (3) conversion of aluminium thickness to vol% of mineral. Procedure and accuracy are described. The CAV method is illustrated for dentin lesions formed in vitro {{as well as}} for clinical root caries lesions. The CAV method is especially advantageous for clinical lesions because it can be employed for very complex mineral distributions and irregular lesion outlines. In given areas of interest, the mineral distribution (in vol%) can be plotted in 3 D form in pseudo-colors. Conventional microradiographical profiles can be obtained directly from the CAV images. For in vitro lesions, the mineral distribution parameters, lesion depth, mineral loss, and mineral acquisition values can be generated from CAV images with a reproducibility of better than 7 %. The CAV method is a valuable tool in quantitative mineral studies of clinical lesions in extracted teeth as well as in in situ lesion investigations...|$|E

40|$|We are {{currently}} constructing the cryogenic infrared {{portion of the}} RATIR instrument at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in collaboration with University of California, Berkeley (UCB) and The University of Mexico (UNAM). The infrared instrument will consist of two 2048 x 2048 Hawaii 2 RG detectors, one on axis and one off axis using diachronic. The detectors will be operated using state-of-the-art Teledyne SIDECAR (System <b>Image,</b> <b>Digitizing,</b> Enhancing, Controlling, And Retrieving) ASICs (Application- Specific Integrated Circuits) similar to NIRSpec on JWST. The visible portion of the instrument is currently being developed at UCB consisting of two CCD imagining cameras. Once completed, the two sections will {{be integrated into the}} RATIR instrument. Mounted on a dedicated, fully-automated 1. 5 -m telescope, the instrument will provide rapid (< 10 min) identification of VHR GRBs allowing high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up observations with large aperture telescopes possible. The hosting Observatorio Astronomico Nacional of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), located on the Sierra de San Pedro Martir in Baja California, Mexico, provides great seeing (- 1 aresec), good weather, dark skies, and significant sky coverage so that RATIR will detect a significant number of Swift afterglows. While not all GRBs will be at high red shifts, the resulting light curves, combined with X-ray/UV observations, will address several open questions, including the nature of both "dark GRBs" and the GRB emission mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the studies was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the <b>image</b> <b>digitizing</b> distribution and display equipment of the installed PACS (Philips) in the Utrecht University Hospital (see also procee-dings SPIE 914, 1988). The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by means of observer performance studies, using ROC analysis. Three series of films were used: chest phantom radiographs, clinical mammographic films, and clinical head CT's. We compared: original films versus images digitized with a video scanner, and/or original films versus images digitized with a laser scanner. Both scanners have 1024 x 1024 x 8 bits output resolution. Four radiologists scored the presence on a 5 -point scale. The results of the mammographic and head CT series will be presented in this paper. The results of the diagnostic accuracy studies of the chest radiographs and their specific methodology will be presented in a companion SPIE paper. Goal of the clinical efficacy study is {{to see if the}} use of a PACS multimodality viewing station at an internal ward has clinical advantages as compared to the conventional situation. Using PACS integrated with a HIS (including a RIS) more easier and faster information is accessible to the clinicians. In this paper we will describe: the procedures which are needed to evaluate the use of the workstation installed at the internal ward, the development of the user interface with four layers of the Image Management System, and the methodology of evaluation the clinical advantages...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} described {{the ability of}} a computer-based <b>image</b> <b>digitizing</b> system to assess early textural changes in acute canine myocardial infarction. To determine whether this technique could be applied to human beings, we studied 12 patients with a first acute transmural myocardial infarction and five normal subjects. Two-dimensional echocardiograms were performed on days 1 and 8 in normal subjects and on days 1 (day of admission), 2, 3, 5, and 14 in the patient population. All recording parameters on the echocardiography machine were kept identical for serial studies. The mean period between hospitalization and first echocardiogram was 11. 1 hours (range 4 to 20 hours). End-diastolic frames from the two-dimensional echocardiographic images were digitized and displayed on a monitor. The mean pixel intensity (MPI) (+/- SD) in the region of asynergy (area of myocardial infarction) and a normal area were determined. In normal volunteers, no significant change in MPI was noted between anteroseptal and lateral areas on two separate two-dimensional echocardiographic studies, which were performed 7 days apart (anteroseptal: MPI, 21. 6 +/- 1. 1 vs 21. 8 +/- 0. 4, p = not significant) and (lateral: MPI, 21. 5 +/- 1. 2 vs 21. 4 +/- 1. 4, p = not significant).
