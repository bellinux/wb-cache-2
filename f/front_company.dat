5|$|Although the United States {{remained}} officially neutral until April 1917, it {{was increasingly}} throwing its {{support to the}} Allies through trade. To counter this, German ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff and Interior Ministry official Heinrich Albert were tasked with undermining American industry and maintaining public support for Germany. One of their agents was a former Bayer employee, Hugo Schweitzer. Schweitzer set up a contract for a <b>front</b> <b>company</b> called the Chemical Exchange Association to buy all of Edison's excess phenol. Much of the phenol {{would go to the}} German-owned Chemische Fabrik von Heyden's American subsidiary; Heyden was the supplier of Bayer's salicylic acid for aspirin manufacture. By July 1915, Edison's plants were selling about three tons of phenol per day to Schweitzer; Heyden's salicylic acid production was soon back on line, and in turn Bayer's aspirin plant was running as well.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Cisco Systems and Apple {{negotiated}} over allowing Apple {{rights to}} use Cisco's Linksys iPhone trademark, but the negotiations stalled when Cisco {{pushed for the}} two products to be interoperable. Following the public unveiling of the Apple iPhone at the 2007 Macworld Expo, Cisco {{filed a lawsuit against}} Apple in January 2007, alleging Apple's iPhone name infringed on Cisco's iPhone trademark. Cisco alleged that Apple created a <b>front</b> <b>company</b> subsequent to their negotiations to try to acquire the rights another way, while Apple countered {{that there would be no}} likelihood of confusion between the two products, because Apple's iPhone product was the first cell phone with such a name, while Cisco's iPhone was a VoIP phone. Bloomberg reported Cisco's iPhone as a product marketed for less than $100 and part of the Linksys home routers, enabling internet-based calls through Skype and Yahoo! Messenger, and contrasted it with Apple's iPhone as a mobile phone which sold for around $600. In February 2007, Cisco and Apple announced an agreement under which both companies would be allowed to use the iPhone name worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} {{founding}} of the CIA in 1947 as the successor to the Office of Strategic Services, the author provides the reader with a chronological overview of the agency's history. He documents the CIA's involvement in the 1953 Iranian coup d'état, and provides a biographical assessment of the motivations of Mohammad Mosaddegh, the Iranian leader deposed in the coup. In briefly describing individuals, organizations and events related to the history of the CIA, Smith notes Russian intelligence Colonel Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher (Rudolf Ivanovich Abel), and discusses the U.S. intelligence operation that used a <b>front</b> <b>company</b> called Zenith Technical Enterprises. The chronological presentation of CIA history is used to provide additional background with regard to the agency's involvement with the War on Terror. The encyclopedia's chronology ends in March 2003.|$|E

50|$|Many {{organized}} crime operations have substantial legitimate businesses, such as licensed gambling houses, building construction companies, restaurants and bars, billiard clubs, trash hauling services, or dock loading enterprises. These <b>front</b> <b>companies</b> enable these criminal organizations to launder their income from illegal activities. As well, the <b>front</b> <b>companies</b> provide plausible cover for illegal {{activities such as}} extortion, drug trafficking, smuggling, and prostitution.

5|$|The scene then {{changes to}} Chuck and Sarah's wedding, {{after which they}} receive a wedding present from Hartley. Two weeks later, Chuck returns from his honeymoon to a deserted Castle, where he learns from Decker {{that he has been}} {{manipulated}} his entire spy career, leading to him receiving the Intersect and facing Fulcrum, the Ring, Daniel Shaw, and Volkoff. It is then revealed that Hartley's gift was all of Volkoff Industries' assets, giving Chuck and Sarah almost a billion dollars. Chuck purchases the Buy More from the government's <b>front</b> <b>company,</b> and he, Sarah, Casey, and Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) set up their own freelance spy operation in Castle to investigate the conspiracy involving Chuck. Morgan then spots a pair of glasses in a box of Chuck's belongings sent from Beckman. Morgan puts them on and accidentally uploads an Intersect.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} the {{propulsion}} plant, {{which was to be}} built in the Netherlands, was taking shape. Requirements sent out in August 1939 mandated that the ships have eight boiler rooms, four sets of geared turbines, and 180,000shp. After further improvements, Nevesbu and two German firms (Germaniawerft was responsible for the turbines and Deschimag for the boilers) began sketching preliminary plans. These were then incorporated into two different design studies, one by Nevesbu and the other by NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (IvS). IvS was purportedly a Dutch company linking Dutch and German designers, but in reality functioned as a <b>front</b> <b>company</b> for German interests. Their design was probably based upon a set of plans drawn up by the Ship Construction Office of the German Navy and received in the Netherlands on 31 August. It did not give the propulsion machinery enough space, and it was thought that this design did not provide enough room for magazines. Nevertheless, it was taken into discussions with the Dutch, where the 11 July design was merged with it. IvS came out with one further plan on 11 March 1940, the merits of which were discussed with the Dutch in April of that year.|$|E
