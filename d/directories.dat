50|$|The <b>Directory</b> Assistance Service (DAS) is an {{obsolete}} {{protocol and}} service for accessing X.500 <b>directory</b> services. DAS {{was intended to}} provide a lightweightmeans for clients to access X.500 <b>directory</b> services via a split-Directory User Agent model. Here the <b>Directory</b> User Agent (DUA) (the <b>directory</b> client) is split into a <b>Directory</b> Assistance (DA) client and a <b>Directory</b> Assistant. The <b>directory</b> user would interact with the DA-client, the DA-Client would communicate with the <b>Directory</b> Assistant using the DA protocol, and the <b>Directory</b> Assistant would communicate with the <b>Directory</b> Service using the X.500 <b>Directory</b> Access Protocol (DAP). That is, the <b>Directory</b> Assistant is a <b>Directory</b> Assistance protocol to DAP gateway. This design allows the DA-client to access the <b>directory</b> without requiring it to support the cumbersome Open Systems Interconnection protocol stack.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{arrangement}} of <b>directory</b> bits called the segment <b>directory</b> to improve <b>directory</b> storage efficiency: a segment <b>directory</b> {{can point to}} several sharing processors with almost {{the same number of}} bits as the pointer which can point to only one. Many <b>directory</b> overflows can be eliminated by using the segment <b>directory</b> element in place of the pointer in the limited <b>directory</b> schemes. Also, the segment <b>directory</b> can be implemented without introducing additional hardware overhead and protocol complexity. The detailed execution-driven simulations show that the segment <b>directory</b> always does better than the pointer and eliminates many <b>directory</b> overflows by up to 85 %. The resulting improvement in bandwidth and execution time is analyzed in detail for limited <b>directory</b> schemes having different behaviors, with respect to the reduced <b>directory</b> overflows. 1...|$|R

Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published <b>directories</b> contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.|$|E

The ability to boot a write-locked SD card with a USB adapter is particularly advantageous for maintaining the integrity and non-corruptible, pristine state of the booting medium.|$|E

5|$|Von Neumann's {{habilitation}} {{was completed}} on December 13, 1927, {{and he started}} his lectures as a privatdozent at the University of Berlin in 1928, being the youngest person ever elected privatdozent in its history in any subject. By the end of 1927, von Neumann had published twelve major papers in mathematics, {{and by the end}} of 1929, thirty-two papers, at a rate of nearly one major paper per month. His reputed powers of memorization and recall allowed him to quickly memorize the pages of telephone <b>directories,</b> and recite the names, addresses and numbers therein. In 1929, he briefly became a privatdozent at the University of Hamburg, where the prospects of becoming a tenured professor were better, but in October of that year a better offer presented itself when he was invited to Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Anti-phishing {{integrates}} with Internet Explorer. It analyzes sites, {{examining the}} website's URL, title, form, page layout, visible text and links, {{and uses a}} blacklist to detect phishing sites. Users are blocked access from suspected phishing sites, however are presented an option to continue. In PC Magazine testing, the feature blocked 22 of 24 phishing sites, while Internet Explorer 7 recognized 17 of the 24 sites. In PC Pro testing, the feature successfully blocked access to every phishing site it was tested against. Spam filtering no longer includes a language feature, Symantec claims it is less useful with current spam and created false positives. Tested against 1,500 messages by PC Magazine, Norton let {{over half of the}} spam to the inbox. Five percent of valid mail were marked as spam. This version utilizes Symantec's Veritas VxMS technology to better identify rootkits. VxMS allows Norton to find inconsistencies among files within <b>directories</b> and files at the volume level. A startup application manager allows users to prevent applications from launching at login. This release drops support for Windows 2000 and was compatible with Windows Vista upon its release with an update.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Xgrid system is designed around a job based system; the controller sends agents jobs, and the agents return the responses. The actual computation that the controller executes in an Xgrid system {{is known as a}} job. The job contains all the files required to complete the task successfully, such as the input parameters, data files, <b>directories,</b> executables and/or shell scripts, the files included in an Xgrid job must be able to be executed either simultaneously or asynchronously, or any benefits of running such a job on an Xgrid is lost. Once the job completes, the controller can be set to notify the client of the task's completion or failure, for example by email. The client can leave the network while the tasks are running. It can also monitor the job status on demand by querying the controller, although it cannot track the ongoing progress of individual tasks.|$|E
