40|$|The current on {{a linear}} strip or wire solves an {{equation}} {{governed by a}} linear integral-differential operator that is {{the composition of the}} Helmholtz operator and an integral operator with logarithmically singular <b>displacement</b> <b>kernel.</b> We investigate the spectral behavior of this classical operator, particularly because various methods of analysis and solution rely on asymptotic properties of spectra, while no investigations of the spectrum of this operator seem to exist. In our approach, we first consider the composition of the second order differentiation operator and the integral operator with logarithmic <b>displacement</b> <b>kernel.</b> Employing the Weyl-Courant minimax principle and properties of the Cebysev polynomials of the first and second kind, we derive index-dependent bounds for the ordered sequence of eigenvalues of this operator and specify their ranges of validity. Additionally we derive bounds for the eigenvalues of the integral operator with logarithmic kernel. With slight modification our result extends to kernels that are the sum of the logarithmic <b>displacement</b> <b>kernel</b> and a real <b>displacement</b> <b>kernel</b> whose second derivative is square integrable. Employing this extension we derive bounds for the eigenvalues of the integral-differential operator of a linear strip with the complex kernel replaced by its real part. Finally, for specific geometry and frequency settings, we present numerical results for the eigenvalues of the considered operators using Ritz’s methods with respect to finite bases...|$|E

Our main result states that minimizers are analytic and have a power series development in terms of even powers of {{the distance to the}} midpoint of the domain of definition and with nonnegative coefficients.

40|$|AbstractA matrix or {{a linear}} {{operator}} A {{is said to}} possess an UV-displacement structure if rank(AU − VA) is small compared with the rank of A. Estimates for the rank of A†V − UA† and more general displacements of A† are presented, where A† is the pseudoinverse of A. The general results are applied to close-to-Toeplitz, close-to-Vandermonde, and generalized Cauchy matrices, Bezoutians, Toeplitz and Hankel Operators, singular integral operators, and integral operators with <b>displacement</b> <b>kernel.</b> This leads to formulas for A† {{which can be used}} for the fast computation of pseudosolutions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{generalization}} {{of the work}} of Roark, Shampine, and Wing given here increases the class of kernels to which their ideas can be applied, and leads to some rather interesting results concerning the case of <b>displacement</b> <b>kernels.</b> Under the assumption that g merely belong to L 1, Roark and Shampine were able to show only that a subsequence of {λnN} converged to gln. By passing from their diagonal C matrix to a full matrix, {{we have been able to}} show that the entire sequence {λnN} convejges as N → ∞. Additional investigations are being carried out for the case A = ∞ in (2. 2). Various representations of the kernel, besides (2. 2), are also being considered. In each case it appears that we can obtain a matrix problem similar to (2. 12). Finally, the expansion (3. 9) suggests several avenues of investigation, and these too are being explored...|$|R
40|$|In ecology we have {{recognized}} that dispersal and especially long distance dispersers are key features when species exploit resources in a landscape (Cain et al. 1998). Still one has not explicitly studied the different features of long distance dispersal itself and their effect {{on the ability of}} exploiting resources. In this study we have divided long distance dispersal into two different features and by modeling and simulations analyzed populations exploitations of resource in different kinds of lattice landscapes. Different movement patterns results in different amount of long distance dispersers, mean displacement etc., and can be characterized by <b>displacement</b> <b>kernels.</b> Studies of animal movement often assume a Gaussian displacement since this is the result of random walk and correlated random walk. There are however many reasons for deviations from Gaussian displacement. Properties of the kernel can be categorized by variance which is an over all measure of long or short distance displacement. A second property is the kurtosis which determines whether the kernel is a Gaussian distribution or plateau shaped with a thin tail, or more peaked with a fatter tail. Kurtosis is also a measurement of deviation from Gaussian displacement. In our model we use a kerne...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is {{well known}} in the field of {{radiative}} transfer that Sobolev was the first to introduce the resolvent into Milne's integral equation with a <b>displacement</b> <b>kernel.</b> Thereafter it was shown that the resolvent {{plays an important role in}} the theory of formation of spectral lines. In the theory of line-transfer problems, the kernel representation in Milne's integral equation has been used to provide an approximate solution in a manner similar to that given by the discrete ordinales method. In this paper, by means of invariant imbedding we show how to determine an exact solution of a Milne-type integral equation with a degenerate kernel, whose form is more general than the Pincherle-Gourast kernel. A Cauchy system for the resolvent is expressed in terms of generalized Sobolev's Φ- and Ψ-functions, which are computed by solving a system of differential equations for auxiliary functions. Furthermore, these functions are expressed in terms of components of the kernel representation...|$|E

We used an individual-based, spatially-explicit framework to characterize seed dispersal and seedling fate in an endangered, insular plant-disperser system: the endemic shrub Daphne rodriguezii and its exclusive disperser, the endemic lizard Podarcis lilfordi. Plant recruitment kernels were chiefly determined by the disperser’s patterns of space utilization (i. e. the lizard’s <b>displacement</b> <b>kernels),</b> the position of the various plant individuals in relation to them, and habitat structure (vegetation cover vs. bare soil). In contrast to our expectations, seed gut-passage rate and its effects on germination, and lizard speed-of-movement, habitat choice and activity rhythm were of minor importance. Predicted plant recruitment kernels were strongly anisotropic and fine-grained, preventing their description using one-dimensional, frequencydistance curves. We found a general trade-off between recruitment probability and dispersal distance; however, optimal recruitment sites were not necessarily associated to sites of maximal adult-plant density. Conservation efforts aimed at enhancing the regeneration of endangered plant-disperser systems may gain in efficacy by manipulating the spatial distribution of dispersers (e. g. through the creation of refuges and feeding sites) to create areas favourable to plant recruitment...|$|R

40|$|The {{estimation}} of exact displacement and <b>displacement</b> rate feedback <b>kernels</b> from finite dimensional control solutions based on finite element structural models is discussed. These kernels are then transformed to equivalent curvature and curvature rate feedback kernels. These curvature kernels are augmented with single point displacement and rotation feedback {{to account for}} rigid body motions. A growing class of sensors known as area-averaging sensors is {{used to measure the}} curvature and curvature rate state functions. The output of area-averaging sensors equals the convolution of all structural curvature states with the spatial sensitivity function of the sensors. Transforming the discrete feedback gains into continuous feedback kernels and employing area-averaging sensors make it possible to implement full state feedback for infinite order structural systems...|$|R

If we consider the total matter power spectrum, the correction is only 0. 05 (0. 03) % for the same mode. It means that EdS assumption is a good approximation for ΛCDM model in LPT theory.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Mathematical Sciences. Applied Mathematics)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. South Africa is {{involved}} in huge mining operations deep in the earth's crust. Stresses induced by these mining operations may cause seismic events or rockbursts to occur, which could damage infrastructure and put miners' lives at risk. The effect of different mining layouts are modelled and used by engineers to make design decisions. The frequency at which models are updated and integrated with the decision making process is not optimal. These large mining layouts can not be modelled adequately using domain methods, but they are particularly well suited for the boundary element method (BEM). This work focuses on the theory and background needed for creating a linear elastic static stress boundary element solver suited to South African mining layouts. It starts with linear elastic theory and subsequently describes the physical continuum, governing equations and the fundamental solutions which {{are an integral part}} of the BEM. Kelvin's solution cannot be applied to crack-like excavations, therefore the <b>displacement</b> discontinuity <b>kernels,</b> which are very well suited to model fractures, are derived. The derivation is approached from both the direct and indirect BEM's perspectives. The problem is cast as a boundary integral equation which can be solved using the BEM. Some of the different specializations of the BEM are discussed. The major drawback of the BEM is that it produces a dense influence matrix which quickly becomes intractable on desktop computers. Generally a mining layout requires a large amount of boundary elements, even for coarse discretization, therefore different techniques of representing the influence matrix are discussed, which, combined with an iterative solver like GMRES or Bi-CG, allows solving linear elastic static stress models...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the {{recovery}} of the in-boundary stress on smooth boundary parts in Boundary Element Method (BEM) in two dimensions. First, two Boundary Integral Representations (BIRs) of tangential derivative of boundary <b>displacements,</b> whose integral <b>kernels</b> multiplying either tangential derivative of displacements or displacements are smooth and bounded, are presented. Two procedures for an in-boundary stress recovery based on these BIRs are developed and analyzed. The first procedure, which directly uses the results obtained from a BEM analysis, displacements and tractions, requires to perform integrations involved in these BIRs either over the real boundary of the solid or over a smooth approximation of the boundary part where the evaluation point is placed. The second procedure, which can be applied on a non-smooth (e. g. polygonal) approximation of the boundary, requires to use in the first BIR introduced here an integral density which is previously smoothed by a local smoothing procedure. The third recovery procedure considered in this work is directly given by a local smoothing procedure of this kind. Results obtained by these three recovery procedures are compared in a series of numerical tests, the best results being obtained by the first procedure developed in this work...|$|R
40|$|The {{asymptotic}} {{stability of}} one-dimensional linear Bresse systems under infinite memories {{was obtained by}} Guesmia and Kafini [10] (three infinite memories), Guesmia and Kirane [11] (two infinite memories), Guesmia [9] (one infinite memory acting on the longitudinal displacement) and De Lima Santos et al. [6] (one infinite memory acting on the shear angle <b>displacement).</b> When the <b>kernel</b> functions have an exponential decay at infinity, the obtained stability estimates in these papers lead to the exponential stability of the system if the speeds ofwave propagations are the same, and to the polynomial one with decay rate otherwise. The subject {{of this paper is}} to study the case where only one infinite memory is considered and it is acting on the vertical displacement. As far as we know, this case has never studied before in the literature. We show that this case is deeply different from the previous ones cited above by proving that the exponential stability does not hold even if the speeds of wave propagations are the same and the kernel function has an exponential decay at infinity. Moreover, we prove that the system is still stable at least polynomially where the decay rate depends on the smoothness of the initial data. For classical solutions, this decay rate is arbitrarily close to. The proof is based on a combination of the energy method and the frequency domain approach to overcome the new mathematical difficulties generated by our system...|$|R
40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need to {{identify}} key marine areas for conservation, particularly in the high seas. A range of techniques have been applied to tracking data from higher predators, particularly seabirds and pinnipeds, to determine the areas of greatest use. This study compared three commonly used methods—kernel, first-passage time and state-space modelling—and a new approach, minimum displacement rate, {{for the analysis of}} data from the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans of Bird Island, South Georgia, tracked during the chick-rearing period. Applied to a single track, these four models identified similar marine areas as important. The greatest similarity in areas identified occurred when model assumptions were shared (such as slow speed indicating spatial preference) even when methods modelled these assumptions differently (e. g. Bayesian inference versus cumulative density surface). A gridded overlap approach applied to all tracks revealed core areas not apparent from results of any single analysis. The gridded approach also revealed spatial overlap between methods based on different assumptions (e. g. minimum <b>displacement</b> rate and <b>kernel</b> analysis) and between individuals. Although areas identified as important by kernel and first-passage time analysis of a single track were biased towards resting locations during darkness, this does not negate the requirement for their protection. Using the gridded overlap approach, two distinct core regions were identified for the wandering albatross; one close to the breeding colony and another 800 km to the North–West in the high seas. This convenient and pragmatic approach could be applied to large data sets and across species for the identification of a network of candidate marine protected areas in coastal and pelagic waters...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the spread of organisms in both {{ecological}} and epidemiological contexts. In {{most of the studies}} presented, displacement is modeled with a spatial kernel function, which is characterized by scale and shape. These are measured by the net squared <b>displacement</b> (or <b>kernel</b> variance) and kurtosis, respectively. If organisms disperse by the assumptions of a random walk or correlated random walk, a Gaussian shaped kernel is expected. Empirical studies often report deviations from this, and commonly leptokurtic distributions are found, often as a result of heterogeneity in the dispersal process. In the studies presented in two of the included papers, the importance of the kernel shape is tested, by using a family of kernels where the shape and scale can be separated effectively. Both studies utilize spectral density approaches for modeling the spatial environment. It is concluded that the shape is not important when studying the population distribution in a habitat/matrix context. The shape is however important when looking at the invasion of organisms in a patchy environment, when the arrangement of patches deviates from randomly distributed. The introduced method for generating patch distribution is also compared to empirical distributions of patches (farms and old trees). Here it is concluded that the assumptions used for modeling of the spatial environment are consistent with the observed patterns. These assumptions include fractal properties such that the same aggregational patterns are found at different scales. In a series of papers, movements of animals are considered as vectors for between-herd disease spread. The studies are based on data found in databases held by the Swedish Board of Agricultural (SJV), consisting of reported movements, as well as farm location and characteristics. The first study {{focuses on the}} distance related probability of contacts between herds. In the following papers, the analysis is expanded to include production type and herd size. Movement data of pigs (and cattle in Paper I) are analyzed with Bayesian models, implemented with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This is a flexible approach that allows for parameter estimations of complex models, {{and at the same time}} includes parameter uncertainty. In Paper IV, the effects of the included factors are investigated. It is shown that all three factors (herd size, production type structure and distance related probability of contacts) are expected to influence disease spread dynamics, however the production type structure is found to be the most important factor. This emphasizes the value of keeping such information in central databases. The models presented can be used as support for risk analysis and disease tracing. However, data reliability is always a problem, and implementation may be improved with better quality data. The thesis also shows that utilizing spatial kernels for description of the spatial spread of organisms is an appropriate approach. However, these kernels must be flexible and flawed assumptions about the shape may lead to erroneous conclusions. Hence, the joint distribution of kernel shape and scale should be estimated. The flexibility of Bayesian analysis, implemented with MCMC techniques, is a good approach for this, and further allows for implementation of more complex models where other factors may be included...|$|R
40|$|Mark-recapture {{analysis}} of populations {{is becoming an}} important tool in population biology. Mark-recapture methods {{can be used to}} estimate transition probabilities among life-stages from capture histories of marked individuals for which stages can be determined at each sampling occasion. This method is called a multi-stage mark-recapture (MSMR) method. In this thesis, I describe advances I made in the MSMR method and present analyses that apply this method to actual data. The advances I made in the MSMR method are motivated by a need to provide a link between mark-recapture data and demographic models such as matrix population models and integrodifference models. I resolve some issues that are commonly encountered during sampling, such as the fact that the sex or life-stage of some individuals is unknown during some sampling occasions and that individuals become unobservable during some life-stages. I introduce a stage-structure that permits simple conversion of estimated transition probabilities into a matrix population model. I describe an algorithm to simplify programming for parameter estimation. I also introduce a method to estimate the distribution of dispersal <b>displacements</b> (a dispersal <b>kernel)</b> from mark-recapture data. I apply some of the methods described above to data of the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). The right whales are {{considered one of the most}} endangered mammals. The current population size is about 300 in the northwestern Atlantic, and the number is declining. I applied the multi-stage mark-recapture statistics to the 17 -year in- dividual sighting history data. (cont.) Using the estimated transition probabilities, I constructed a population projection matrix, which was used for further demographic analyses. I found that the population was slowly increasing in 1980, but it started to decline slowly around 1992. I show that (1) this change was caused by increased mortality of females that have just given birth, (2) protecting two females a year from the deaths is enough to prevent the declining trend, and (3) demographic stochasticity is a more important factor influencing their long-term viability than environmental stochasticity. by Masami Fujiwara.
