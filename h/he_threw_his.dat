Thinking the police might be after him, <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>his</b> weapons (a dagger {{and a bottle}} of poison) out the train window. Once he arrived in Bosnia-Herzegovina he had to set about looking for replacement weapons.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in the Senate, Stanley {{returned}} to his legal practice. In the 1927 gubernatorial election, <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>his</b> support to his old enemy, J. C. W. Beckham, hoping to improve his chances of returning to the Senate in 1930. Beckham lost to Republican Flem D. Sampson, greatly diminishing Stanley's chances in the senatorial campaign.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{supporters}} {{sought to}} make him the National Republican nominee for governor in the election of 1828. Though his nomination was all but certain, Crittenden declined the opportunity, fearing that his association with Clay, who was losing popularity in the state, would cost his party the election. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>his</b> support behind Thomas Metcalfe, {{who went on to}} carry a very close election over Democrat William T. Barry. Crittenden instead sought another term in the Kentucky House, but was again denied the seat.|$|E

5|$|In early , Koufax asked Dodgers GM Buzzie Bavasi {{to trade}} {{him because he}} wasn't getting enough playing time. By the end of 1960, after going 8–13, Koufax was {{thinking}} about quitting baseball to devote himself to an electronics business that he'd invested in. After the last game of the season, <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>his</b> gloves and spikes into the trash. Nobe Kawano, the clubhouse supervisor, retrieved the equipment to return to Koufax the following year (or to somebody else if Koufax {{did not return to}} play).|$|E
5|$|Newsom {{attended}} Santa Clara University on {{a partial}} baseball scholarship and student loans, where {{he graduated in}} 1989 with a B.S. in political science. Newsom was a left-handed pitcher for Santa Clara, but <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>his</b> arm out after two years and hasn't thrown a baseball since. He lived in the Alameda Apartments, which he later compared to living in a hotel. He later reflected on his education fondly, crediting the Jesuit approach of Santa Clara that he said has helped him become an independent thinker who questions orthodoxy. Newsom spent a semester studying abroad in Rome.|$|E
5|$|On April 21, 2015, Davis {{pitched a}} perfect eighth inning in {{the losing side}} of a blowout against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, {{retiring}} all 3 batters he faced, all on ground balls, using only 9 pitches. Davis in high school was 23–0 with a 1.85 ERA and was the Arizona High School Pitcher of the Year, and in college he had a 2.25 ERA as a pitcher. Against the Angels <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>his</b> fastball as high as 88 miles per hour, threw a slider in the high 70s, and threw a cutter. It {{was the first time}} the A’s had a position player pitch since Frank Menechino in 2000.|$|E

5|$|According {{to local}} legend Marko's mother was Evrosiya (Евросия), {{sister of the}} Bulgarian voivoda Momchil (who ruled {{territory}} in the Rhodope Mountains). At Marko's birth three narecnitsi (fairy sorceresses) appeared, predicting {{that he would be}} a hero and replace his father (King Vukašin). When the king heard this, <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>his</b> son into the river in a basket to get rid of him. A samodiva named Vila found Marko and brought him up, becoming his foster mother. Because Marko drank the samodivas milk, he acquired supernatural powers and became a Bulgarian freedom fighter against the Turks. He has a winged horse named Sharkolia ("dappled") and a stepsister, the samodiva Gyura. Bulgarian legends incorporate fragments of pagan mythology and beliefs, although the Marko epic was created as late as the 14–18th centuries. Among Bulgarian epic songs, songs about Krali Marko are common and pivotal.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw rebounded {{his next}} start by {{pitching}} an 8 inning two-hitter and out-dueling the then undefeated Ubaldo Jiménez. He credited his {{control of the}} slider being the major turning point for him. Later in the season, he was suspended for five games after hitting Aaron Rowand of the Giants with a pitch in a game on July 20. The incident occurred after both teams were given a warning following Giants ace Tim Lincecum hitting Matt Kemp earlier in the game. <b>He</b> <b>threw</b> <b>his</b> first career complete game shutout on September 14, 2010 also against San Francisco and finished {{the season with a}} record of 13–10 and a 2.91 ERA in 32 starts, pitching 204 innings and recording 212 strikeouts.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1992, Kosar's {{physical}} decline {{had long}} been apparent to Belichick, which left the coach with a difficult choice. Kosar was Cleveland's most popular athlete, a hometown boy who had forgone big money and a bigger profile to lead a struggling team back to the top. While he recognized {{it would be an}} unpopular decision, Belichick wanted to bench Kosar, and in 1992 the team picked up a potential replacement in Vinny Testaverde from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Belichick named Kosar the starter before the 1993 season, but in the third game against the Raiders, Belichick pulled Kosar after <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>his</b> third interception of the night. Taking over with Los Angeles ahead 13–0, Testaverde led two touchdown drives to win the game. Two weeks later, Belichick named Testaverde the starter. On the verge of tears after a loss to the Dolphins, Kosar said he was disappointed with the decision and felt he had done what he could with what was at his disposal.|$|E

50|$|Doyle's fastball {{does not}} have great velocity. As a result, <b>he</b> <b>throws</b> <b>his</b> two-seam fastball more often than his four-seam fastball. He also has a curveball, slider, and changeup. Doyle relies on control of his pitches.|$|R
5|$|LSU {{received}} {{the ball to}} start the second half and started their fifth offensive drive from their own 18. After they gained a first down on a short pass {{on a pair of}} runs, the Alabama defense stopped the Tigers on their next series to force a punt. Alabama then started from their own 48, but were only able to muster a three and out. This resulted in their first punt of the night from Cody Mandell. With Lee back at quarterback for LSU, <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>his</b> second interception, this time to Mark Barron, to give Alabama possession at the LSU 35. Again the LSU defense held the Alabama offense in check to set up another long field goal attempt. This time Foster connected on a 46-yard field goal to give the Crimson Tide a 6–3 lead. On the next drive, LSU was able to gain a pair of first downs primarily with only runs by Jefferson and Ford, but again were forced to punt. Alabama started this drive from their own 11, and was able to gain a pair of first downs on McCarron passes before he threw an interception to Morris Claiborne that was returned to the Alabama 15. The quarter ended two plays later after a pair of LSU runs resulted in no gain.|$|E

25|$|Nilsson {{understands the}} mention of Thor and his hammer as a {{reference}} {{of the story of}} Thor's fishing; where <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>his</b> hammer at the head of Jörmungandr, the Midgard serpent. Since Thor's hammer always returns to its thrower it might in this case be said that it 'fled from evil' and 'came from the sea'.|$|E
25|$|His parents {{admitted}} {{that if they}} had their way, Blair would have gone to Tennessee because they liked the Volunteers' coach Bruce Pearl, and {{thought it would be a}} good idea for their son to leave the city.

Hera, Ares' mother, saw Ares' interference and asked Zeus, Ares' father, for permission to drive Ares away from the battlefield. Hera encouraged Diomedes to attack Ares and <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>his</b> spear at the god. Athena drove the spear into Ares' body, and he bellowed in pain and fled to Mt. Olympus, forcing the Trojans to fall back.|$|E

25|$|After {{two days}} of rest, Phillippe was ready to pitch a second {{straight}} game. <b>He</b> <b>threw</b> <b>his</b> third complete game victory of the series against Bill Dinneen, who was making his second start of the series. But Phillippe's second straight win was almost not to be, as the Americans, down 5–1 {{in the top of}} the ninth, rallied to narrow the deficit to one run. The comeback attempt failed, as Phillippe managed to put an end to it and give the Pirates a commanding 3–1 Series lead.|$|E
25|$|The Stevensons vacationed at lake {{resorts in}} Wisconsin during summers. There, Stevenson befriended William Freeman Vilas, a growing voice among Midwest Democrats {{and a friend}} of Grover Cleveland. Stevenson was a {{delegate}} to the 1884 Democratic National Convention, and after briefly supporting a local candidate, <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>his</b> support behind Cleveland. Vilas and Stevenson personally informed Cleveland of the nomination. When Cleveland was elected that November, Vilas was named postmaster general. Although a different supporter was initially named assistant postmaster general, Stevenson received the position after the first choice fell ill.|$|E
25|$|The {{reign of}} Ivan III and his {{successor}} was plagued {{by a number of}} heresies and controversies. One party, led by Nil Sorsky and Vassian Kosoy, called for the secularisation of monastic properties. They were opposed by the influential Joseph of Volotsk, who defended ecclesiastical ownership of land and property. The sovereign's position fluctuated, but eventually <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>his</b> support to Joseph. New sects sprang up, some of which showed a tendency to revert to Mosaic law: for instance, the archpriest Aleksei converted to Judaism after meeting a certain Zechariah the Jew.|$|E
