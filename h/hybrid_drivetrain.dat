25|$|In 2007, several {{automobile}} manufacturers announced that future vehicles will use aspects of hybrid electric technology {{to reduce fuel consumption}} {{without the use}} of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>drivetrain.</b> Regenerative braking can be used to recapture energy and stored to power electrical accessories, such as air conditioning. Shutting down the engine at idle {{can also be used to}} reduce fuel consumption and reduce emissions without the addition of a <b>hybrid</b> <b>drivetrain.</b> In both cases, some of the advantages of hybrid electric technology are gained while additional cost and weight may be limited to the addition of larger batteries and starter motors. There is no standard terminology for such vehicles, although they may be termed mild hybrids.|$|E
25|$|The car {{launched}} {{successfully in}} nine European countries in October 1998, {{but the final}} design did not fulfill Hayek's expectations. Hayek pushed for a <b>hybrid</b> <b>drivetrain</b> but the final product used a relatively conventional gasoline engine. Shortly afterward Daimler-Benz bought out SMH's remaining stake in the company. MCC was now a wholly owned subsidiary of Daimler-Benz (which soon merged with Chrysler Corporation to become DaimlerChrysler). The office in Biel was shut down and operations were consolidated at the MCC GmbH design centre in Germany. On January 1, 1999, MCC GmbH {{changed its name to}} MCC smart GmbH, and by 2000, it dropped the last vestiges of the association with SMH, becoming smart GmbH.|$|E
25|$|The Toyota TS030 Hybrid LMP1 car, {{a racing}} car {{developed}} under Le Mans Prototype rules, uses a <b>hybrid</b> <b>drivetrain</b> with supercapacitors. In the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans race a TS030 qualified with a fastest lap only 1.055 seconds slower (3:24.842 versus 3:23.787) than the fastest car, an Audi R18 e-tron quattro with flywheel energy storage. The supercapacitor and flywheel components, whose rapid charge-discharge capabilities help in both braking and acceleration, made the Audi and Toyota hybrids the fastest {{cars in the}} race. In the 2012 Le Mans race the two competing TS030s, {{one of which was}} in the lead for part of the race, both retired for reasons unrelated to the supercapacitors. The TS030 won three of the 8 races in the 2012 FIA World Endurance Championship season. In 2014 the Toyota TS040 Hybrid used a supercapacitor to add 480 horsepower from two electric motors.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of the first phase of Argonne National Laboratory's (ANL's) examination of the costs and energy impacts of light-duty hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). We call this research an HEV Technology Assessment, or HEVTA. HEVs are vehicles with drivetrains that combine electric drive components (electric motor, electricity storage) with a refuelable power plant (e. g., an internal combustion engine). The use of <b>hybrid</b> <b>drivetrains</b> is widely considered a key technology strategy in improving automotive fuel efficiency.

25|$|Hybrid {{technology}} for buses has seen increased attention since recent battery developments decreased battery weight significantly. Drivetrains consist of conventional diesel engines and gas turbines. Some designs concentrate on using car engines, recent designs {{have focused on}} using conventional diesel engines already used in bus designs, to save on engineering and training costs. Several manufacturers are currently working on new hybrid designs, or hybrid drivetrains that fit into existing chassis offerings without major re-design. A challenge to hybrid buses may still come from cheaper lightweight imports from the former Eastern block countries or China, where national operators are looking at fuel consumption issues surrounding {{the weight of the}} bus, which has increased with recent bus technology innovations such as glazing, air conditioning and electrical systems. A hybrid bus can also deliver fuel economy though through the <b>hybrid</b> <b>drivetrain.</b> Hybrid technology is also being promoted by environmentally concerned transit authorities.|$|E
500|$|Toyota of Thailand {{unveiled}} a reworked {{version of the}} East and Southeast Asian-market Camry in June 2009 equipped with a <b>hybrid</b> <b>drivetrain.</b> The revised Aurion-based Camry previewed the Australian Aurion's then upcoming facelift. The updated car features new headlamp and taillamp lens clusters with integrated foglamps, along with a redesigned front bumper, grille insert, and revised interior trim details. The revised Aurion was designed by Australian chief designer Nick Hogios, who also designed the original Aurion, and Anthony Cheung, assistant project manager from Thailand, in 2007. The hybrid version was also designed by Takafumi Ito, who also designed the facelifted regular Camry. The design registrations for the facelifted hybrid version, nothing changes made to the original were filed on 19 December 2008 at the US Patent and Trademark Office. Toyota Australia later revealed the updated car as its Aurion on 21 September. While the front-end of the original Aurion was designed with a [...] "double-concave" [...] architecture, the revised version abandons this for an [...] "X-Form" [...] design philosophy, characterised by a lower and wider trapezoidal shaped grille.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1982, [...] SMH (makers of the Swatch {{brand of}} watches) CEO Nicolas Hayek began {{developing}} {{an idea for}} a new car using the same type of manufacturing strategies and personalization features used to popularize Swatch watches.

2500|$|A {{more recent}} working {{prototype}} of the HEV was built by Victor Wouk (one of the scientists involved with the Henney Kilowatt, the first transistor-based electric car). Wouk's work with HEVs in the 1960s and 1970s earned him the title as the [...] "Godfather of the Hybrid". Wouk installed a prototype <b>hybrid</b> <b>drivetrain</b> (with a [...] electric motor) into a 1972 Buick Skylark provided by GM for the 1970 Federal Clean Car Incentive Program, but the program was stopped by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1976 while Eric Stork, {{the head of the}} EPA's vehicle emissions control program at the time, was accused of a prejudicial coverup.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to the gasoline-only variants, several {{features}} {{are unique to}} the hybrid. In addition to the hybrid powertrain, the Camry Hybrid employs electric power steering, brakes, and air conditioning that are fully operational once {{the internal combustion engine}} is deactivated. The car can run in an all-electric mode, gasoline-only or both. A real-time dashboard screen shows power distribution and the operation of the hybrid system and the tachometer is replaced by an analog fuel economy readout. The <b>hybrid</b> <b>drivetrain</b> has also necessitated a redesigned front subframe, along with remodeled rear and center floor pressings. This was required to accommodate the battery pack, which is stowed in the trunk. Other differences include wheel spats and underbody pans which reduce aerodynamic drag from 0.28 to 0.27cd, an [...] "Eco" [...] operating mode for the HVAC system that reduces the output of air conditioning to assist fuel economy, and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM). Cosmetic changes are limited to redesigned tail lights with LEDs, a chrome-lined grille, as opposed to the color-coded version on every other Camry trim, and hybrid-oriented emblems including [...] "Hybrid" [...] badging on the front fenders and a decklid-mounted [...] "Hybrid Synergy Drive" [...] logo.|$|E
