The approach was from {{the north side of}} the mountain and the climbing was planned to be after the monsoon. The monsoon was unusually late that year and, beset by the weather and in difficult conditions of snow, little was achieved regarding the summit. However, a very large number of lesser peaks were climbed for the first time and a southern route up the Western Cwm was identified as a possible line of approach if Nepal could ever be persuaded to change its policy of not admitting climbers.|$|E

25|$|Richmond {{dominated}} the 1967 season, running out winners {{in a classic}} Grand Final against Geelong. In his first two years, the team lost only seven games and Hafey had gone from an unknown coach in the bush to the toast of the football world. In hindsight, the 1967 premiership marked {{a turning point for}} the game. The Tigers were fitter than any team that <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>before</b> and were the highest scoring team since 1950. Australian football, after two decades of defensive-based play, was about to enter an era of high scoring, aided by rule changes, new tactics and betters standards of fitness.|$|E

Her winning time of 7.84 seconds took {{a tenth of a}} second off her previous best for the 60m hurdles. No longer having to do both academics and sport, her new focus on hurdling brought results at the Drake Relays, where she moved up to twelfth on the all-time lists with a new personal record of 12.40 seconds – three tenths faster than she <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>before.</b> She also defeated former Olympic champion Dawn Harper-Nelson and world champion Brianna Rollins in the process. She improved one hundredth further at the Jamaica International Invitational, with a meeting record of 12.39 seconds. Her debut appearance on the 2015 IAAF Diamond League circuit established her as an elite international performer. She won the Doha Diamond League meeting in a series record time of 12.35 seconds – this moved her up to seventh on the all-time rankings for the 100m hurdles.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} page, the rich golden burial {{sites of the}} Zenú are described, {{as well as the}} routes inland from later Venezuela, that was conquered by German conquistadors. The next {{paragraph}} narrates about the start of the main expedition inland from Santa Marta, leaving the city in the month of April 1536. It is said Gonzalo Ximénez de Quesada left with 600 men, divided into 8 groups of infantry, 10 groups of cavalry and a number of brigs on the Magdalena River. De Quesada and his troops marched over land {{on the bank of the}} river. Names of the captains in the army of De Quesada are given as San Martín (Juan de Sanct Martín), Céspedes (Juan de Céspedes), Valençuela (Pedro Fernández de Valenzuela), Lázaro Fonte, Librixa (Antonio de Lebrija), Juan de(l) Junco and Suarex (Gonzalo Suárez Rendón). The captains heading the brigs are named as Corral (Francisco Gómez del Corral), Cardosso (Antonio Díaz de Cardoso) and Albarracín (Juan de Albarracín). The troops went out of free will and consent of the governor of Santa Marta; Pedro de Lugo, after the death of García de Lerma. The troops went under command of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada. The third page describes that the troops spent more than a year and more than 100 leguas on their journey. They reached La Tora , farther than any soldier <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>before,</b> after 150 leguas. The expedition took so long because of the waters and the narrow passages of the surrounding area.|$|E

Items like a non-return valve simply cannot now be assembled in the wrong sense." [...] Nevertheless, Perry wrote, [...] " [...] would be amazed how many people have still tried {{to do so in the}} forty-seven years since, most realising their mistake after looking in the manual and quietly and ruefully thanking those who <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>before</b> them and made it impossible." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{departure}} from industry practice, Radiohead conducted no interviews and did not tour before the release of A Moon Shaped Pool. On 30 April 2016, days before the album was announced, fans who had previously made orders from Radiohead received embossed cards with lyrics from the album's lead single, [...] "Burn the Witch". On 1 May, Radiohead deleted all content from their website and social media profiles, replacing them with blank images. Donwood said the idea had been [...] "a way {{of getting rid of}} all of [...] <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>before</b> ...

[...] There is no such {{difficulty}} with the most famous jewel in the collection, the Lyte Jewel, which was made in London and presented to Thomas Lyte of Lytes Cary, Somerset in 1610 by King James I of England, who loved large jewels, and giving them to others. Lyte was not a regular at court, but he had drawn up a family tree tracing James's descent back to the legendary Trojan, Brut. The jewel contains a miniature portrait of the king by Nicholas Hilliard, though for conservation reasons this is now removed from the jewel. Lyte wears the jewel in a portrait of 1611, showing a drop below the main oval set with three diamonds, which <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>before</b> 1882.

500|$|After regaining the {{majority}} in both Houses of Congress, some Republicans, led by Harrison, attempted to pass legislation to protect black Americans' civil rights. Harrison's Attorney General, William H. H. Miller, through the Justice Department, ordered the prosecutions for violation of voting rights in the South; however, white juries often failed to convict or indict violators. This prompted Harrison to urge Congress to pass legislation that would [...] "secure all our people a free exercise {{of the right of}} suffrage and every other civil right under the Constitution and laws." [...] Harrison endorsed the proposed Federal Elections Bill written by Representative Henry Cabot Lodge and Senator George Frisbie Hoar in 1890, but the bill was defeated in the Senate. Following the failure to pass the bill, Harrison continued to speak in favor of African American civil rights in addresses to Congress. Most notably, on December 3, 1889, Harrison <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>before</b> Congress and stated: ...|$|E
500|$|Campbell had {{to sleep}} wearing his make-up. Because of several scenes that {{required}} to be shot in both {{the day and the}} night, it was considered easiest to have Campbell sleep all night wearing his make-up, since removing it was too complicated. When Campbell eventually had the effect removed, he was alarmed to notice that his face had actually [...] "changed shape" [...] because of how long the make-up had been applied, though it returned to normal after an extended amount of time. This serves as one of several moments where the film-makers had to be creative to make the film considering the low budget. Other examples include blacking out the windows to make scenes darker and shooting all night long to make the filming schedule. Raimi had to get increasingly inventive during production, often coming up with [...] "bizarre" [...] ideas while shooting scenes. This led to him experimenting with camera moves and camera speeds, [...] "taking it a little further than we <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>before,</b> recording synch-sound at a third slower for a more monstrous effect.|$|E

[...] Vice films typically tacked on endings where the most sin-filled characters were either punished or redeemed. Films explored Code-defying subjects in an unapologetic manner with the premise that an end-reel moment could redeem all that <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>before.</b> The concept of marriage was often tested in films such as The Prodigal (1931), {{in which a woman}} is {{having an affair with a}} seedy character, and later falls in love with her brother-in-law. When her mother-in-law steps in at the end of the film, it is to encourage one son to grant his wife a divorce so she can marry his brother, with whom she is obviously in love. The older woman proclaims the message of the film in a line near the end: [...] "This the twentieth century. Go out into the world and get what happiness you can." ...|$|E

Michael Tedder of Vulture awarded the episode five stars out of five and {{wrote that the}} episode was able to provide solid conclusions for all of the characters. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and wrote that [...] "the quality of this series finale is found in the way it functions right now, in the afterglow of a TV show to which many devoted more than 100 hours of their lives. Some aspects of the episode fall flat, but when it hits, it hits." [...] Ultimately, he found that Finale' is not a great piece of television" [...] but that it was the finale that [...] "The Office needed" [...] because it was [...] "the right point to jump off ... the circular track", due to the series idea of thematic reoccurrence. Tom Gliatto of People magazine, however, gave the episode a negative review, and wrote that [...] "this episode was poorly conceived and clumsily structured.

500|$|Nevertheless, O'Neill was {{selected}} to make his debut in the five-Test series against England, playing {{in all of the}} matches. The First Test in Brisbane was a low scoring match described by Australian captain Richie Benaud as producing [...] "some of the slowest and worst cricket imaginable", O'Neill made 34 in Australia's first innings of 186 to help secure a lead of 52. He then top-scored with an unbeaten 71 in the second innings, guiding Australia to an eight-wicket victory. O'Neill scored 71 of the last 89 runs scored while he was at the crease, refusing to be dried up by the England's usage of leg theory. It enlivened a match plagued by time-wasting, and best remembered for a depressingly slow innings by England's Trevor Bailey, who scored 68 from 426 balls in seven and a half hours. England captain Peter May described O'Neill's innings as [...] "sparkling" [...] and said that it made [...] "everything which <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>before</b> look even more wretched". Retired English player Ian Peebles, writing in the Sunday Times, said [...] "Although O'Neill is in the very early stages of his career, it is already something of an occasion when he comes to the wicket, and one can sense the expectancy of the crowd and the heightened tension of the opposition". Wisden opined that O'Neill had [...] "saved a game that had been tortuous for days". For his part, O'Neill said that the dour play was [...] "unbelievable" [...] and that he was [...] "just about falling to sleep" [...] in the field.|$|E
