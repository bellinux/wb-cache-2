5|$|Sasuke was not {{included}} in Kishimoto's original concept of the Naruto manga. While discussing the future of the series, his editor advised him to add a rival character for the series' protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki, so he created Sasuke. Kishimoto read a variety of manga to gather ideas for creating an effective rivalry between the characters, and he incorporated these elements into Naruto and Sasuke's relationship. Kishimoto also drew inspiration from his own relationship with his twin brother, Seishi. Since childhood, Masashi had worried about Seishi when he faced failures, such as in <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>or</b> <b>college,</b> and tried to help him.|$|E
5|$|After {{a safety}} is scored, {{the ball is}} put into play by a free kick. The team that was scored upon must kick the ball from their own 20-yard line and can punt, drop kick, or place kick the ball. In {{professional}} play, a kicking tee cannot be used – however, a tee {{can be used in}} <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>or</b> <b>college</b> football. Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team touches the ball.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2004–05 NBA season, the Mavericks were re-tooled again. Defensive center Erick Dampier was {{acquired}} from the Golden State Warriors, but Nowitzki's close friend Steve Nash left Dallas {{and returned to}} the Phoenix Suns as a free agent. During the season, long-time head coach Don Nelson resigned, and his assistant Avery Johnson took on coaching duties. In the midst of these changes, Nowitzki stepped up his game and averaged 26.1 points a game (a career high) and 9.7 rebounds, and his 1.5 blocks and 3.1 assists were also career numbers. In addition, Nowitzki scored at least 10 points in every game and was one of four players who registered at least 1.2 steals and blocks per game. This was also his second 2,000-point season; his 26.1 points scoring average set a new record by a European player. On December 2, 2004, Nowitzki scored 53 points in an overtime win against the Houston Rockets, a career best. As a reward, Nowitzki was voted to the All-NBA First Team for the first time. He also placed third in the league's MVP voting, behind Nash and Shaquille O'Neal. By being elected to the All-NBA First Team, Nowitzki became the first player who did not attend a United States <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>or</b> <b>college</b> to be on the All-NBA First Team. On January 18, 2005, Nowitzki scored his 10,000th career point in a 137-120 Mavericks win against the Washington Wizards.|$|E

25|$|In the US, Latino/as who {{identify}} as LGBTQ face scrutiny {{not just from}} their community at home but within their community at school as well, especially within a <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>or</b> <b>college</b> preparation experience. While facing scrutiny by family and community to maintain gender normality in order to prosper in the US, they also must face scrutiny from their fellow peers, mentors and administration in the educational environment. One such scrutiny that they face {{is a lack of}} acceptance and recognition as a separate educational entity within sexual educational programs, provided by many high school education districts. Lesson plans that are developed for the high school learning environment put emphasis on Heteronormativity of the and Latino students. Latinas are viewed as needing to have less interest in sexual education, while Latinos were told to maintain focus and to take the education seriously. When teachers are prompted to explain more about sexual education for lesbians or gays, the teachers or educators assume the student body to be heterosexual and refuse or regard the questions as immature and outside the scope of their teaching.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{initiatives}} {{sponsored by the}} CJC was the International Jewish Correspondence (IJC). The goal of the IJC was to link Jews {{around the world as}} pen-pals. The organization was founded by Barry Simon in 1978. Simon was a high school maths teacher in Montreal who had been running a general Canadian pen-pal service called Correspondence Canada since 1967. With the rise of the internet in the 1990s, IJC became less active and had folded by 2002. Its letters and administrative files were donated by Simon to the Canadian Jewish Congress Charities Committee National Archives. During its existence, IJC received thousands of letters. The organization also provided addresses for Jews living in Arab and Soviet Bloc countries as well as Jewish prisoners who were put in contact with others in the same situation. The correspondents in the archive range in age from seven-year-old school children to retired persons and came from all walks of life. However, the largest proportion of letters came from <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>or</b> <b>college</b> students. The majority of the letters are in English, although other languages are represented including French, Hebrew, Spanish and Yiddish.
