5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate I began to <b>feel</b> <b>there</b> was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E

25|$|While it has {{sometimes}} proven {{difficult to work}} out familial relationships within the Pama–Nyungan language family, many Australian linguists <b>feel</b> <b>there</b> has been substantial success. Against this, some linguists, such as R. M. W. Dixon, suggest that the Pama–Nyungan group – and indeed the entire Australian linguistic area – is rather a sprachbund, or group of languages having very long and intimate contact, rather than a genetic language family.|$|E

25|$|Whilst the Reform, Conservative and Modern Orthodox {{movements}} {{have stated that}} they <b>feel</b> <b>there</b> is not a conflict between evolutionary theory and the teachings of Judaism, some Haredi rabbis have remained staunchly opposed to certain teachings in evolutionary theory. In contrast with the literalist biblical interpretation of some Christian creationists, they express an openness to multiple interpretations of Genesis, through Jewish oral tradition and Jewish mysticism. They have also expressed an openness to evolutionary theory in biology, except where they perceive {{that it is in}} conflict with the Torah's account of creation.|$|E
25|$|While green {{has emerged}} as the color of Taiwan {{independence}} and can be seen ubiquitously in pro-independence rallies, at the moment, no one flag has achieved consensus among the various groups. Unlike other political movements, those in Taiwan do not <b>feel</b> <b>there</b> is a historical or local flag suitable for use as a symbol. The flag of the short-lived Republic of Formosa is considered to be unsuitable by some, since that republic was declared by Chinese loyalists and designed as a tributary state in a failed attempt to avert Japanese colonization in 1895. The present national flag, the flag of the Republic of China, is seen by others as a symbol of Chinese nationalism.|$|E
25|$|Kew Gardens Hills {{is a mixed}} {{neighborhood}} of single-family homes– detached or in rows– as well as three to six-story garden apartment buildings mostly built during the years immediately following World War II, such as Regency Gardens. These apartments are characterized by their lawns and internal pathways that give the complexes a small-neighborhood <b>feel.</b> <b>There</b> are several homes in Kew Gardens Hills that predate Main Street, whose property was subject to eminent domain in the 1930s to widen 144th Street into the Main Street extension from northern Flushing. A few public housing projects {{in one part of}} the neighborhood were also built. Other buildings in that area were built to house employees of certain unions, including the Electchester Co-operative Building, built for electrical employees in 1949 on what used to be the grounds of the Pomonok Country Club, which no longer houses electrical employees exclusively.|$|E

500|$|Carey {{describes}} the controversy and politics around this field: [...] "At one extreme we have scientists claiming experimental proof is lacking to support sometimes sweeping claims.

[...] Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, during a discussion about terrorism, torture and the law, took offense at a Canadian judge's remark that Canada, [...] "thankfully", did not consider what Jack Bauer would do when setting policy. He reportedly responded with a defense of Bauer, arguing that law enforcement officials deserve latitude in times of great crisis, and that no jury would convict Bauer in those types of situations.|$|E

500|$|Concerned {{about the}} plight of fellow ex-servicemen, whose {{businesses}} were often failing, Gellibrand banded together with like-minded individuals to form the Hobart Remembrance Club. This organisation aimed to support ex-servicemen by providing employment and support for their businesses. The Hobart Club inspired the formation of Legacy Australia in Melbourne, which over time became a national movement, expanding its scope to the care of ex-servicemen's widows and their families. The Hobart Club did not join Legacy until 1940, but Charles Bean wrote in 1944 that [...] "coming back to the great and good man from whose original work it all sprang—there was a time when some of us thought that the best monument to John Gellibrand might be the story of Second Bullecourt.

500|$|The {{design of}} the road was re-envisioned to include {{extensive}} wetland protection west of the parkway and in the parkway median, a trail system {{along the side of}} the parkway, and numerous pedestrian overpasses and underpasses for ease of access to the trail system. Many of the architectural features were also specially-designed to give the parkway a unique <b>feel.</b> <b>There</b> are a total of [...] of protected areas to the west of the highway, and an additional [...] of wetlands along the length of the highway. The Legacy Nature Preserve lays along the western border of the parkway near its southern terminus. Further north, the parkway forms much of the eastern border of the Farmington Bay Waterfowl Management Area. For the entirety of the parkway's length it is paralleled by the Legacy Parkway Trail, and is partially paralleled by the Denver and Rio Grande Western rail trail.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{story by}} Michael Halperin contained a different subplot involving {{a problem with}} the dilithium in the warp drive of the Enterprise. The diplomatic conference was added by D.C. Fontana when it was developed into a teleplay. Fontana had previously worked on , including the episode [...] "Journey to Babel". [...] "Lonely Among Us" [...] was subsequently compared to [...] "Journey to Babel", which Fontana denied, saying, [...] "I wrote 'Journey to Babel' and I wrote this too, and I <b>feel</b> <b>there</b> is a difference. There's a definite delineation and separation here, both in intent and content." [...] Director Cliff Bole did not recall much of the episode later, but did not think much of the script, saying [...] "The subject matter affects the end product. There's some better written shows, obviously." [...] It was the first episode of The Next Generation to be directed by Bole, who had previously worked on shows such as V and The Six Million Dollar Man.|$|E

500|$|In rehearsal, Haynes, Blanchett and Mara {{realized}} certain {{lines that}} either character {{did not need}} to say should be cut, which Haynes deemed the [...] "stylistic practice that we all took throughout the creative departments. I <b>feel</b> <b>there</b> was an understanding with them that words and dialogue were never carrying the weight of the story." [...] Costume Designer Sandy Powell said of working with Haynes, [...] "Todd is super visual, super prepared and he provides his own visuals {{at the beginning of the}} film. He starts with a look book of images that he's compiled over the months and months. He's almost OCD about it. In a good way." [...] The look of the film was influenced by the post-war color photography of Ruth Orkin, Esther Bubley, Helen Levitt, and Vivian Maier, as well as the abstract photography of Saul Leiter. Haynes used their works as a visual reference for depicting a [...] "dirty and sagging" [...] New York.|$|E

In 1982, Killebrew received 59.3% of the vote, taking a backseat to Hank Aaron and Frank Robinson, who made it in their first year of eligibility. After receiving 71.9% of the vote in 1983, Killebrew said that not getting in that year was more difficult to accept than the previous two times, and asked [...] "Why do the writers <b>feel</b> <b>there</b> only has to be a certain number inducted each time?"

500|$|Connor Trinneer (who played Commander Trip Tucker), {{felt that}} the finale {{should have had a}} memorable {{farewell}} that he described as a [...] "M*A*S*H moment", but that the producers did not want to focus on such an element. Anthony Montgomery (who played Ensign Travis Mayweather) was similarly displeased with the finale and said [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>there</b> could have been a more effective way to wrap things up for our show as well as the franchise as a whole. It just seemed to take a little bit away from what the Enterprise cast and crew worked so diligently to achieve over the past four years." [...] While Frakes enjoyed working with Sirtis again, he said that [...] "the reality is {{it was a bit of}} a stretch to have us shut down [...] show," [...] and that in hindsight it was a disservice to them. The early criticism forced the show's producers to hold a conference and address the issue. Braga admitted there was cast unrest, but defended the episode as a way to close not just Enterprise but Star Trek as a whole.|$|E

[...] The Democratic candidate won in the South and in the western states except California and Oregon. [...] Bryan was also successful in his native Nebraska and neighboring Kansas and South Dakota. [...] McKinley swept the populous northeastern states, and the Midwest. [...] He had hoped to end sectionalism, but his only successes in the [...] "Solid South" [...] were in the border states of Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia and Kentucky. [...] McKinley took 51.0% of the vote, the first presidential majority since Grant in 1872; the intense voter interest in the campaign resulted in a turnout of 79.3%. [...] On Election Night, Hanna wired from Cleveland to Canton, [...] "The feeling here beggars description ... I will not attempt bulletins.

500|$|Based {{upon their}} findings, {{and despite the}} expense and their {{intention}} to air [...] "Snuffy's Parents Get a Divorce" [...] in April 1992, the CTW decided not to risk possibly harming their audience and not air the episode. McGrath said,"They wrote a whole show and taped it, {{and it was just}} devastating for test groups of kids. So they just threw the whole thing in the garbage and never tried it again. It was just too difficult a concept for a 3-year-old". CTW Research director Valeria Lovelace recommended scrapping the episode and going [...] "back to the drawing board", and the idea was abandoned, at least for the season. Producer Michael Loman recalled, [...] "We ate the cost and never aired it. We <b>feel</b> <b>there</b> are a range of issues that we can deal with in the family that do not go to the extreme of divorce". According to Sesame Street researcher Susan Scheiner, {{it was the first time}} the CTW had produced an episode, and after making a large investment, found after tests that the episode did not work. Rosemarie T. Truglio and her colleagues at the CTW cited the episode as an example of the CTW's practice of [...] "listening to the voices of children and by putting their needs first".|$|E
