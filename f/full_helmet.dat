5|$|The Greek {{style of}} warfare had been honed over the {{preceding}} centuries. It {{revolved around the}} hoplite, members of the middle-classes (the zeugites) who could afford the armour necessary to fight in this manner. The hoplite was, {{by the standards of}} the time, heavily armoured, with a breastplate (originally bronze, but probably by this stage a more flexible leather version), greaves, a <b>full</b> <b>helmet,</b> and a large round shield (the aspis). Hoplites were armed with a long spear (the doru), which was evidently significantly longer than Persian spears, and a sword (the xiphos). Hoplites fought in the phalanx formation; the exact details are not completely clear, but it was a close-knit formation, presenting a uniform front of overlapping shields, and spears, to the enemy. Properly assembled, the phalanx was a formidable offensive and defensive weapon; on occasions when it is recorded to have happened, it took a huge number of light infantry to defeat a relatively small phalanx. The phalanx was vulnerable to being outflanked by cavalry, if caught on the wrong terrain, however. The hoplite's heavy armour and long spears made them excellent troops in hand-to-hand combat and gave them significant protection against ranged attacks by light troops and skirmishers. Even if the shield did not stop a missile, there was a reasonable chance the armour would.|$|E

5000|$|Along with Alan Foster and Brian Lopes John Purse is {{credited}} with bringing back the <b>full</b> face <b>helmet</b> back into BMX in the Summer of 1996. The <b>Full</b> Face <b>Helmet</b> (Figure 1) has a rigid chin bar structure to protect the lower front half of the head. It {{had fallen out of}} fashion since the mid-1980s for BMX racing due in part with claims that it hindered the racer's vision. The fact that it also obscured the racer's face in magazine photos also may have had a role in its decline in popularity. By the mid-1980s the three quarter or [...] "open faced" [...] helmet were standard (Figure 2). For lower face protection a racer used a combination chin and mouthguard that strapped onto the bottom of the helmet called generically a [...] "Joffa". During this ten-year interim the only serious BMX riders who regularly used <b>full</b> faced <b>helmets</b> where ramp style freestyle riders and later dirt jumpers. Both of whom perform complicated trick maneuvers from significantly high altitudes off the ground, as much as 30 to 40 feet at times. Ironically, as <b>full</b> face <b>helmets</b> gained in popularity among racers, it declined among dirt jumpers (although ramp freestylers still used them). Dirt Jumpers and even some freestylers stopped wearing BMX helmets of any kind and started using skateboarding helmets that only protected the crown of the head; again for visibility reasons when doing stunts.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} motorcycle rider {{death rates}} between states with full motorcycle helmet laws and those without. This was done using both unadjusted bivariate analyses and multivariate random-effects generalized least squares regression models of rider death rates. Multivariate models were adjusted for the competing influences of several explanatory variables, including {{the existence of}} a motorcycle helmet law. From 1994 to 1996, states with helmet laws experienced a median death rate of 6. 20 riders per 10 000 registered motorcycles and states without helmet laws experienced a median death rate of 5. 07 riders per 10 000 registered motorcycles (P= 0. 008). After controlling for other factors that affect motorcycle rider fatalities (most notably population density and temperature), death rates in states with <b>full</b> <b>helmet</b> laws were shown to be lower on average than deaths rates in states without <b>full</b> <b>helmet</b> laws (P= 0. 740).

40|$|During {{defeat of}} high {{velocity}} bullets and fragmentation, large deformations {{have been shown}} to occur on the inside of non-metallic helmet shells. If these deformations contact the underlying head there is the potential to cause injury, termed as Behind Helmet Blunt Trauma (BHBT). A method of assessing BHBT is required to fully understand the protective capability of a helmet system. Existing methods using synthetic head models are limited in their ability to predict injury outcome {{as a result of a}} lack of available injury criteria. The aim of this study was to improve the prediction of cranial fracture outcomes associated with BHBT, focusing on the effect of impact curvature and flat face diameter. Representative impact curvatures and flat face diameters were derived from helmet back face deformation measurements in free-air. An instrumented projectile was used to deliver a repeatable impact to a Bovine Scapula Model (BSM); the BSM being a fracture analogue for the cranium. Cranial fracture risk curves were developed using BSM fracture outcomes. These were developed for the different curvatures and flat face diameters tested, using the parameters of peak impact force, impact velocity, bone thickness considered in conjunction with impact velocity, and the Blunt Criterion (BC). It was concluded that flat impact diameter and radius of curvature should be measured within BHBT assessment to improve the accuracy of cranial fracture prediction. To support application of the risk curves to BHBT assessment methods, it was recommended that fracture outcome should be investigated in terms of the effect of using a rigid projectile when compared to helmet deformation. BHBT assessment methods should consider how to achieve consistent and representative stand-off. Testing should also be completed on <b>full</b> <b>helmet</b> systems as opposed to flat material samples...|$|E
50|$|A <b>full</b> face <b>helmet</b> {{covers the}} entire head, with a rear {{that covers the}} base of the skull, and a {{protective}} section over the front of the chin. Such helmets have an open cutout in a band across the eyes and nose, and often include a clear or tinted transparent plastic face shield, known as a visor, that generally swivels up and down to allow access to the face. Many <b>full</b> face <b>helmets</b> include vents to increase the airflow to the rider.The significant attraction of these helmets is their protectiveness. Some wearers dislike the increased heat, sense of isolation, lack of wind, and reduced hearing of such helmets. Full-face helmets intended for off-road or motocross use sometimes omit the face shield, but extend the visor and chin portions to increase ventilation, since riding off-road is a very strenuous activity.Studies have shown that <b>full</b> face <b>helmets</b> offer the most protection to motorcycle riders because 35% of all crashes showed major impact on the chin-bar area. Wearing a helmet with less coverage eliminates that protection — the less coverage the helmet offers, the less protection for the rider.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} the motorcycle helmet law implemented in Taiwan on June 1, 1997. METHODS: Collecting data on 8795 cases of motorcycle-related head injuries from 56 major Taiwanese hospitals, we compared the situation 1 year before and after implementation of the helmet law. RESULTS: After implementation of the law, the number of motorcycle-related head injuries decreased by 33 %, from 5260 to 3535. Decreases in length of hospital stay and in severity of injury and better outcome were also seen. The likelihood ratio chi 2 test showed that severity decreased after the law's implementation (P <. 001). <b>Full</b> <b>helmets</b> were found to be safer than half-shell helmets. CONCLUSION: The helmet law effectively decreased the mortality and morbidity from motorcycle-related head injuries...|$|R
