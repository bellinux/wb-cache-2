The dining hall {{also serves as}} a kitchen classroom, where {{students}} prepare food for the areas known as the Innovation Kitchen, the Line, and the Brooklyn Brewery. The Brooklyn Brewery was established with New York City company Brooklyn Brewery, which sponsored the on-campus brewery and trained staff. The brewery has a full-time brewer, assisted by bachelor's students in the beverage concentration. The Innovation Kitchen is staffed by students in the <b>intrapreneurship</b> concentration. The students break into groups and create a business plan, including marketing, menus, and a human resources manual. The Line is operated by students and has a cycling menu which changes every three weeks and seasonally. The Egg also has a separate cooking suite, the Café, which serves hot foods, coffee, and sushi. The dining hall has an open plan and a variety of decor, including lounge areas, dining tables, a retail food and beverage market, large television screens, a stage for entertainment and cooking demonstrations, and outdoor patios. The hall also has a private dining room and a lounge area with a fireplace and library.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s, {{entrepreneurship}} {{has been}} extended from its origins in for-profit businesses to include social entrepreneurship, in which business goals are sought alongside social, environmental or humanitarian goals, and even {{the concept of the}} political entrepreneur.

50|$|<b>Intrapreneurship</b> is a {{contemporary}} issue with pressing relevance for corporate managers. Antoncic and Hisrich conclude that <b>Intrapreneurship</b> {{has a positive}} impact on organisational growth and profitability. Organisations that build structures and embed values to support <b>Intrapreneurship</b> are consequently {{more likely to have a}} high Intrapreneurial Orientation and are more likely to grow than organisations with a low Intrapreneurial Orientation. Intrapreneurial organisations are more innovative, they continually renew and this proactive approach leads to new business venturing. Interestingly, their findings indicate that <b>Intrapreneurship</b> could be particularly beneficial for transition economies.|$|E
50|$|In general, the {{academic}} approach to <b>Intrapreneurship</b> is predominantly {{based on the}} company wide re-organisation required to foster <b>intrapreneurship.</b> By contrast, the corporate view is often that innovation is the means, rather than the end. This is described in Capozzi et al. where the driver for innovation is identified as the strategic need to grow the core business. Thus, {{there is often a}} difference in the vocabulary used with academics preferring <b>intrapreneurship</b> and practitioners talking of innovation.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{well-known}} examples of <b>intrapreneurship</b> is the [...] "Skunk Works" [...] group at Lockheed Martin. The group was originally named after a reference in a cartoon, and was first brought together in 1943 to build the P-80 fighter jet. Because the project was to eventually {{become a part of}} the war effort, the project was internally protected and secretive. Kelly Johnson, later famous for Kelly's 14 rules of <b>intrapreneurship,</b> was the director of this group.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, Gifford and {{his wife}} Elizabeth, along with Sherman Severin and Jill Bamburg, founded the Bainbridge Graduate Institute (BGI), now merged with Presidio Graduate School.

50|$|For {{creating}} sustained value through building <b>intrapreneurship</b> {{into the}} organization, a strong management commitment is essential.

50|$|Gifford Pinchot III (born December 29, 1942) is an American entrepreneur, author, inventor, and President of Pinchot & Company. He is {{credited}} with inventing the concept of <b>intrapreneurship</b> in a paper {{that he and his}} wife, Elizabeth Pinchot, wrote in 1978 titled Intra-Corporate Entrepreneurship while attending Tarrytown School for Entrepreneurs in New York.|$|E
50|$|Formerly, Clay led work {{focused on}} scaling social {{innovation}} at Ashoka and co-founded the League of Intrapreneurs, a network focused on scaling {{the movement of}} social <b>intrapreneurship.</b> Along with John Elkington and Maggie de Pree she was the co-author of The Social Intrapreneur: A Field Guide for Corporate Changemakers, a report sponsored by the Skoll Foundation.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2000s, {{entrepreneurship}} {{has been}} extended from its origins in for-profit businesses to include social entrepreneurship, in which business goals are sought alongside social, environmental or humanitarian goals, and even {{the concept of the}} political entrepreneur.

5000|$|... "Intrapreneurship {{refers to}} {{employee}} initiatives in organizations to undertake something new, without {{being asked to}} do so." [...] Hence, the intrapreneur focuses on innovation and creativity, and transforms an idea into a profitable venture, while operating within the organizational environment. Thus, intrapreneurs are Inside entrepreneurs who follow the goal of the organization. <b>Intrapreneurship</b> is an example of motivation through job design, either formally or informally. (See also Corporate Social Entrepreneurship: <b>intrapreneurship</b> within the firm which is driven to produce social capital in addition to economic capital.)Employees, such as marketing executives or perhaps those engaged in a special project within a larger firm, are encouraged to behave as entrepreneurs, even though they have the resources, capabilities and security of the larger firm to draw upon. Capturing a little of the dynamic nature of entrepreneurial management (trying things until successful, learning from failures, attempting to conserve resources, etc.) adds to the potential of an otherwise static organization, without exposing those employees to the risks or accountability normally associated with entrepreneurial failure.|$|E
50|$|Another {{approach}} is to promote innovation or introduce new products or services or markets in existing firms. This {{approach is}} called corporate entrepreneurship or <b>Intrapreneurship,</b> and was made popular by author Gifford Pinchot in his book of the same name. Newer research indicates that clustering is now a driving factor. Clustering occurs {{when a group of}} employees breaks off from the parent company to found a new company but continues to do business with the parent. Silicon Valley is one such cluster, grown very large.|$|E

50|$|Another example {{could be}} 3M, who {{encourage}} many projects within the company.

(In the days of its founders, HP used to have similar policies and just such an innovation-friendly atmosphere and intrapreneurial reputation.)

5000|$|The first written use of {{the terms}} ‘intrapreneur’, ‘intrapreneuring,’ and ‘intrapreneurship’ date from a paper written in 1978 by Gifford Pinchot III and Elizabeth Pinchot. Later the term was {{credited}} to Gifford Pinchot III by Norman Macrae in the April 17, 1982 issue of The Economist. The first formal academic case study of corporate entrepreneurship or <b>intrapreneurship</b> was published in June 1982, as a Master's in Management thesis, by Howard Edward Haller, on the intrapreneurial creation of PR1ME Leasing within PR1ME Computer Inc. (from 1977 to 1981). This academic research was later published {{as a case study}} by VDM Verlag as <b>Intrapreneurship</b> Success:A PR1ME Example.The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language included the term 'intrapreneur' in its 3rd 1992 Edition, and also credited Pinchot as the originator of the concept. The term [...] "intrapreneurship" [...] was used in the popular media first in February 1985 by TIME magazine article [...] "Here come the Intrapreneurs" [...] and then the same year in another major popular publication was in a quote by Steve Jobs, Apple Computer’s Chairman, in an interview in the September 1985 Newsweek article, which quotes him as saying, [...] "The Macintosh team was what is commonly known as intrapreneurship;only a few years before the term was coined - a group of people going, in essence, back to the garage, but in a large company." ...|$|E
50|$|If {{a company}} decides to adopt {{corporate}} social entrepreneurship, {{there are a}} few researched circumstances that have been shown to increase socially intrapreneurial activity. When there is a change in the environment that disconnects sanctions and rewards, a disassociation of the company norms from their assumed moral foundations, resulting in an undermined set of core beliefs. When employees are dissatisfied with the existing moral assumptions of the company, {{they are more likely to}} take personal initiative. If the employee feels they will be supported and given access to resources without immediate guaranteed results, these employees are more likely to pursue social <b>intrapreneurship</b> past the idea stage.|$|E
5000|$|Kumar was a [...] "star senior partner," [...] and [...] "one of McKinsey’s {{most senior}} {{employees}} and brightest stars." [...] He co-founded McKinsey's offices in Silicon Valley and India and created {{and led the}} Firm's business in three different areas of Internet companies (representing 25-30% of McKinsey's worldwide revenues at its peak), outsourcing, and <b>intrapreneurship.</b> He was the protégé of former chief executive Rajat Gupta, though he was blamed for the collapse of McKinsey's e-commerce initiatives after the dot-com collapse and never ran in the elections for managing partner (chief executive).

5000|$|The biggest {{challenge}} for intrapreneurs {{is dealing with}} the [...] "Corporate Immune System". This expression means that corporate organizational structures such as bureaucracy, hierarchy, rules etc. do not support intrapreneurial culture and behaviour. Many companies struggle with applying the concept of <b>intrapreneurship</b> into their daily routines due to high levels of defined tasks and schedules that deter opportunities for serendipity and for new ideas to be recognised. Issues around a highly defined schedule and lack of necessary time and space for idea creation are also highlighted in an article by Sushain Pandit (2015). Kawasaki (2006) also highlights the lack of rewards for entrepreneurial behaviour as a demotivating factor to search for new ideas.|$|E

5000|$|An {{internal}} entrepreneur {{is known}} as an intrapreneur (makes part of <b>intrapreneurship)</b> and is defined as [...] "a person within a large corporation who takes direct responsibility for turning an idea into a profitable finished product through assertive risk-taking and innovation".

5000|$|In The New Industrial State, the American {{economist}} John Kenneth Galbraith {{posited that}} large firms manage both their prices and consumer demand {{for their products}} through sophisticated statistical methods. Galbraith also pointed out that, because of the increasingly complex nature of technology and specialization of knowledge, management had become increasingly specialized and bureaucratized. The internal structures of corporations and companies had been transformed into {{what he called a}} [...] "technostructure", where specialized groups and committees are the primary decision-makers, and specialized managers, directors and financial advisers operate under formal bureaucratic procedures, replacing the individual entrepreneur's role (see also: <b>Intrapreneurship).</b> He states that both the obsolete notion of [...] "entrepreneurial capitalism" [...] and democratic socialism (defined as democratic management) are impossible organizational forms for managing a modern industrial system.|$|E
50|$|Kingsland's seven level colour model, Spectrum Theory, {{formed the}} core of the Centre's {{pioneering}} research into human communication, personal and organisational development.

Work on Vision was one of the centre's earliest achievements {{at the beginning of the}} 1970s. The original Vision to Action model (later also called Vision to Reality) was invented at this time by Kevin Kingsland and shared through hundreds of seminars and communication groups. It is a seven level model which describes the way a vision incarnates as it unfolds through the levels of the mind and is reified.

At SPJIMR, ASCI and NIASOM, he introduced {{the concept of}} self-audit for management students - where the students takes responsibility for {{a part of his}} syllabus, topic, teacher, examination and examiner. Students' participation in management of business school is his avowed ideal. When enquired as to why he has not started any further experimentation at Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management (LBSIM), of which he was the Director, he has an interesting response. Lal Bahadur Shastri's Himalayan legacy runs at LBSIM. Lal Bahadur Shastri was known for his simplicity, honesty, integrity and assertiveness. Anyone understanding these values and internalizing the principles {{as a way of life}} does not need any further extramurals. At Sri Sri University he has introduced a concept for management students called ADLOP (Assessment and Development of Leadership and Outreach Potential).|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{widespread}} appointment {{of ethics and}} compliance officers in the U.S.A., many organizations in the United States have experienced difficulty in adding aspects of corporate social entrepreneurship/responsibility into their practices, {{due to the fact}} that these methods must be created within the organization. Corporate social entrepreneurship requires those at the top of an organization to take charge and put the company in a position to have a positive social impact, such as offering rewards for employees that act in a socially responsible manner. The value system that is employed within an organization plays a large role for the emergence of corporate social entrepreneurs. Moreover, the sustainability of social <b>intrapreneurship</b> ventures have been called into question by critics, and the process is generally long and strenuous. Socially beneficial ventures have had difficulties turning profit, as they often look at the long term benefits while struggling in the short term, leading to hesitance from investors. Nevertheless, Hemingway's (2013) study showed enormous variation in the types of activities corporate social entrepreneurs were engaged in, across all the domains of CSR. This activity also ranged in scale: from formally sanctioned projects, to informal activity taking place under the organizational 'radar'.|$|E
