Kids this age have to be careful; they all want to sound like Brunnhildes. Having been a coloratura, I know it is possible to be heard in big houses without screaming your guts out. I want them to develop patience and a real sense of self-confidence, so they can stand up for what they believe in musically and not be pushed around.

'I've been a little too sudden in telling you the worst, haven't I?' says the old gentleman kindly; 'but you must be taught <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up <b>your</b> mind <b>to</b> meet {{the full extent of}} this misfortune {{for the sake of the}} child, whose future comfort and happiness depend greatly on you.' And then he bid me keep up her reading and writing, and force her to use her voice as much as I could, by every means in my power. He told me I should find her grow more and more unwilling to speak every day, just for the shocking reason that she couldn't hear a single word she said, or a single tone of her own voice. He warned me that she was already losing the wish and the want to speak; and that it would very soon be little short of absolute pain to her to be made to say even a few words; but he begged and prayed me not to let my good nature get the better of my prudence on that account, and not to humor her, however I might feel tempted to do so--for if I did, she would be dumb as well as deaf most certainly. He told me my own common sense would show me the reason why; but I suppose I was too distressed or too stupid to understand things as I ought. He had to explain it to me in so many words, that if she wasn't constantly exercised in speaking, she would lose her power of speech altogether, for want of practice--just the same as if she'd been born dumb. 'So, once again,' says he, 'mind you make her use her voice. Don't give her her dinner, unless she asks for it. Treat her severely in that way, poor little soul, because it's for her own good.' ...|$|R

The source code is available under GNU GPL v 3 license and the library is free for non-commercial use, open source and platform independent. Note that the license of the algorithms included in BGSLibrary not necessarily have the same license of the library. Some authors do not allow that their algorithms will be used for a commercial purpose, first is needed to contact them to ask permission. However, by default, we decided to adopt the GPL-v 3 license. The BGSLibrary also provides one Java based GUI (Graphical User Interface) allowing the users to configure the input video-source, region of interest, and the parameters of each BS algorithm. A MFC-based GUI is also provided for a quick access in Windows computers. But, a QT-based GUI is coming for a platform independent usage. To build/run the BGSLibrary, it is necessary to have the OpenCV library installed previously. Everyone is invited to collaborate with the BGSLibrary.

6000|$|If {{designing}} {{could be}} taught, {{all the world}} would learn: as all the world reads--or calculates. But designing {{is not to be}} spelled, nor summed. My men continually come to me, in my drawing class in London, thinking I am to teach them what is instantly to enable them to gain their bread. [...] "Please, sir, show us <b>how</b> <b>to</b> design." [...] "Make designers of us." [...] And you, I doubt not, partly expect me to tell you to-night <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> designers of <b>your</b> Bradford youths. Alas! I could as soon tell you <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> or manufacture an ear of wheat, as <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a good artist of any kind. I can analyze the wheat very learnedly for you--tell you there is starch in it, and carbon, and silex. I can give you starch, and charcoal, and flint; but you are as far from your ear of wheat as you were before. All that can possibly be done for any one who wants ears of wheat is to show them where to find grains of wheat, and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> sow them, and then, with patience, in Heaven's time, the ears will come--or will perhaps come--ground and weather permitting. So in this matter of making artists--first you must find your artist in the grain; then you must plant him; fence and weed the field about him; and with patience, ground and weather permitting, you may get an artist out of him--not otherwise. And what I have to speak to you about, tonight, is mainly the ground and the weather, it being the first and quite most material question in this matter, whether the ground and weather of Bradford, or the ground and weather of England in general,--suit wheat.|$|R
