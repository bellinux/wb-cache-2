40|$|We {{study the}} clear-sky aerosol {{radiative}} forcing at infrared wavelengths {{using data from}} the Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-Asia) cruise of the NOAA R/V Ronald H. Brown. Limited number of data points is analyzed mostly from ship and collocated satellite values. An optical model is derived from chemical measurements, lidar profiles, and visible extinction measurements which is used to and estimate the <b>infrared</b> aerosol <b>optical</b> thickness and the single scattering albedo. The IR model results are compared to detailed Fourier Transform Interferometer based infrared aerosol forcing estimates, pyrgeometer based infrared downward fluxes, and against the direct solar forcing observations. This combined approach attests for the self-consistency of the optical model and allows to derive quantities such as the infrared forcing {{at the top of the}} atmosphere or the <b>infrared</b> <b>optical</b> thickness. The mean <b>infrared</b> aerosol <b>optical</b> thickness at 10 microns is 0. 08 and the single scattering albedo is 0. 55. The modeled infrared aerosol forcing reaches 10 W/sq m during the cruise, which is a significant contribution to the total direct aerosol forcing. The surface infrared aerosol radiative forcing is between 10 to 25 % of the shortwave aerosol forcing. The infrared aerosol forcing at the top of the atmosphere can go up to 19 % of the solar aerosol forcing. We show good agreement between satellite (CERES instrument) retrievals and model results at the top of the atmosphere. Over the Sea of Japan, the average infrared radiative forcing is 4. 6 W/sq m in the window region at the surface and it is 1. 5 W/sq m at top of the atmosphere. The top of the atmosphere IR forcing efficiency is a strong function of aerosol temperature while the surface IR forcing efficiency varies between 37 and 55 W/sq m (per <b>infrared</b> <b>optical</b> depth <b>unit).</b> and changes between 10 to 18 W/sq m (per <b>infrared</b> <b>optical</b> depth <b>unit)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} a {{research}} project to establish a fundamental understanding of the physical relationships between the material structure and the <b>infrared</b> <b>optical</b> properties of polymeric transparent insulation (TI) materials are described. First, a systematic characterization of potential materials for TI applications in respect to their relevant physical properties in the infrared radiation range was done. Second, based on the investigation of polymer films with different thicknesses model functions for the <b>infrared</b> <b>optical</b> properties were established. Third, the <b>infrared</b> <b>optical</b> properties were interpreted on base of polymerphysical relations. The characterization in the infrared range and the calculation of <b>infrared</b> <b>optical</b> film properties have revealed, that various functional groups of the macromolecular structure are highly absorbing. For polymers with service temperatures of about 100 °C the carbon-oxygen single bond was identified as highly effective. For 50 µm thick films a good correlation between the concentration of the functional carbon-oxygen group and the non-spectral <b>infrared</b> <b>optical</b> thickness as well as the hemispherical emittance was found.

In {{order to}} improve the {{transmission}} and durability of <b>infrared</b> <b>optical</b> materials, the antireflection characteristics of two dimensional sub-wavelength structures on <b>infrared</b> <b>optical</b> materials were investigated.
