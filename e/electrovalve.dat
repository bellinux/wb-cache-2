An acoustical tube interacts with a numerically simulated mouthpiece in real-time, with the aim to propose in the long term both a tool for objective measurements, and a new musical instrument, easily playable, with unique timbral capacities. This preliminary study focusses on a first prototype, to verify the physical meaningfulness and estimate its potential. A microphone at the tube entrance feeds a numerical model of the reed used to compute the volume flow through the reed channel. This is the output of the numerical part, which is directed to an <b>electrovalve</b> that proportionally modulates the volume flow between the compressed air source and the tube entrance. The hybrid instrument is characterized by studying its parts separately (evaluation of the <b>electrovalve</b> characteristics, impedance measurement of the resonator), but also as a whole by analyzing its behaviour when the parameters of the mouthpiece are varied. Both transients and steady regimes are compared to a fully simulated instrument. We observed a coherent functioning for fundamental frequencies sufficiently below the electrovalves first resonant frequency. The foremost drawbacks are associated to the electrovalves mechanics and to noisy pressure measurements...|$|E

The analysis of the hydraulic plant, carried out in part I of this two-part study, is here utilized to develop the control algorithm. The control strategy is based on a feed-forward and a proportional integral controller through pulse width modulation with a constant frequency and variable duty cycle. The feed-forward contribution requires modeling of the nonlinear openloop system behavior which has been experimentally identified and described through two-dimensional maps: the inputs are the duty cycle applied to the <b>electrovalves</b> and the pressure drop across their orifice, while the output is the pressure gradient in the brake caliper. These maps, obtained for inlet and outlet valves, are used to set the feed-forward term. Finally a proportional integral controller is designed to reject external disturbances and compensate for model uncertainties.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} article is to analyse the {{performances}} of a modern vehicle equipped with a novel suspension system linking front, rear, right and left cylinders via a semi-active hydraulic circuit, developed by the Tenneco Automotive company. In addition to improving the vehicle's vertical performances (in terms of comfort), both the stiff roll motion of the carbody and the soft wrap motion of the rear/front wheel-axle units can be obtained and tuned via eight <b>electrovalves.</b> The proposed system avoids the use of classical anti-roll bars, which would be incompatible with the wrap performance. A major problem of the project is to produce a realistic and efficient 3 D multibody dynamic model of an Audi A 6 coupled, at the equational level, with an hydraulic model of the suspension including cylinders, accumulators, valve characteristics, oil compressibility and pipe dynamics.

40|$|Du graphe (P, V) de la {{compression}} d'un mélange gaz-liquide, on peut tirer la valeur du taux volumique de gaz dans le mélange. La vérification théorique et expérimentale de ce principe ainsi que ses limites d'application comme moyen de mesure sont présentées. Ce résultat a été utilisé pour développer un système de mesure de l'aération de l'huile moteur, le SMAC (Système de Mesure d'Aération par Compressibilité). Des exemples d'application, tels que l'étude de la sensibilité de certaines huiles à l'aération, sont exposés. Oil aeration {{can be a}} {{real problem}} in engine oil circuit. The involved lubrication power decrease and thermic properties changes can damage the engine. Furthermore, the increased compressibility is very dangerous for hydraulic systems like valve lash adjusters. A first step to control this aeration {{is to be able to}} measure it. Gammametry is often used but this measurement needs a very precise calibration and is quite complicated and dangerous. A new absolute measurement has been discovered, based on the difference of compressibility between air and oil. It is absolute because the measurement principle is independant of the conditions, The system does not need a new calibration at each new environment. It is valid for any gas-liquid mixture. From the (P, V) graph of a gas-liquid mixture compression, one can derive the gas-liquid volumetric ratio. The log-log graph (P/PO, 1 -V/VO) of a mixture sample pressurization always shows an inflexion point. The y value of this inflexion point (1 -V/VO) is equal to the volumetric gas ratio of the sample (before compression). This phenomenon is obvious on hydraulic curves (see Annexe 1). To check it, we have proceeded to a theoretical demonstration and an experimental verification. The theoretical demonstration of this principle concludes that the principle is verified as long as the ration P index 0 / alpha B is small. B is the oil bulk modulus, alpha is the volumetric gas ratio and P index 0 the sample initial pressure. Numerical simulations indicate that the pressurization must be regular and fast enough to avoid the problems coming from dissolution. They also indicate that small leakage could be profitable by decreasing the maximum pressure needed to meet the inflexion without modifying the measurement. The experimental verification consists in measuring the (P,V) graphs during the pressurization of different known mixture samples. The positions of the inflexion points of the log log graphs were compared with the known volumetric gas ratio. The correlation is very good and the deviations were inside the error range of the preparation of the mixture samples. Based on this principle, a system of oil aeration measurement has been developped : the SMAC (french name for Compressibility based oil Aeration Measurement System). The system is able to take samples from a given circuit by <b>electrovalves.</b> The sample is then regularly pressurized by a piston; pressure, piston displacement and temperature are stored along the time in a PC. The inflexion point is then determined, the gas ratio calculated and printed by a soft on the PC. The whole operation takes around three minutes. This apparatus has been used for two studies. The first one was dealing with hydraulic valve lash adhusters (HLA). The SMAC was measuring the gas ratio of oil in the circuit. The aim was to evaluate the influence of aeration on the HLA. The second study consists in defining a new oil aeration test method to measure the influence of silicone additives on aeration. Generally speaking, the SMAC principle can be used on almost any gas liquid mixture to measure the volumetric gas ration...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal {{and hope for}} engines of the near future {{is the development of}} wide range fuel-flexibility within internal combustion engines. This research dissertation presents three innovations that have pushed the boundary of science and technology to enable this vision on the mini scale. First, the design and construction of a new small-scale, fuel flexible, engine dynamometer that allowed for precise measurement and control of mini engines operating on non standard fuels. Second, the fuel-flexible characterization of the O. S. Graupner Wankel engine and the successful production of output mechanical power between 10 - 500 W from a range of petroleum-based and bio fuels: gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, bioethanol and military-grade JP 8 (among others). Lastly, a low-cost, multi-fuel switching system was designed and tested that controllably delivered a range of fuels to the engine and allowed for the first continual fuel-flexible operation using an array of fuels. In addition to these scientific contributions, it will be shown how the small-scale engine dynamometer and its peripherals were designed, constructed and tested such that future researchers can make advancements toward the {{ultimate goal}} enabling wide-range fuel flexibility on the small scale. This work determined a number of the key parameters for small-scale fuel flexible engine operation (4. 97 cc). Previous work only showed that fuel flexibility was possible in larger scale rotary engines and turbines [...] where operating conditions differ greatly from their smaller-scale counterparts. The present work extended the understanding of what engine parameters are critical for enabling fuel-flexible engine operation on this small scale and helped discover the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities of mini fuel flexible rotary engines which prior work had not described. The design and construction of a new small-scale engine dynamometer was essential as no commercially available dynamometers on this scale existed and the legacy systems failed to capture all necessary engine data; especially those needed to characterize fuel flexibility. This dynamometer consisted of an engine mount and loading system, therequired sensors for measurement, the actuators to dynamically and repeatedly control engine and the integration of all these elements into a usable data acquisition system. The characterization consisted mainly of the maximum power outputs of the engine while running on specific fuels, the engine operating conditions during max power output, the stoichiometry ranges of each fuel {{in the context of the}} O. S. Graupner Wankel engine and output efficiencies. Other preliminary characterizations on emissions, combustion pressure and other typical engine tests were developed but not fully characterized but will be introduced. The design and construction of a multi-fuel switching system was also integral to extending and characterizing fuel flexibility on this small scale. Early experiments only tested fuels independently and switched between them by hand. However, future systems would need to be able to change fuels on-demand and sequentially in real time. Therefore, a system that could accommodate the storage of multiple fuels and then deliver them reliably to the engine at the click of an on-screen fuel selector button was built, better syncing the fuel data with the engine performance data. The resulting fuel-flexible engine characterization system was then tested amongst a variety of liquid hydrocarbon based fuels in order to create a fuel-flexible engine mapping for a Wankel engine of 4. 97 cc displacement. During multi-fuel combustion, the following parameters were measured in an effort to fully characterize this engine: engine torque, mass flow rate of ambient air intake, stoichiometry, ambient temperature and humidity, ambient pressure, engine speed, mass fuel flow rate, engine housing temperature, engine exhaust temperature and loading brake temperature and the fuel selection. This data collection was possible through the design and integration of the LabVIEW data acquisition system architecture in concert four input / output devices: the NI-USB- 6221, NI-USB- 9162 and two ArduinoUNO microcontrollers. The design and integration will be fully described along with the new system potential and shortcomings. In addition to the data acquisition, the system was also designed to enable future real-time control using conventional low-cost model engine servos such that the system could be fully automated. In the current system, there are eight actuation devices that control the throttle position, the glow plug heat, the fuel to air ratio, the dynamometer brake and four <b>electrovalves</b> that control the delivery of each fuel. The mechanical design and construction of all these control mechanisms are also described along with their added potential to enhancing fuel flexibility and opportunities for future improvement. The fuel flexible dynamometer system, multi fuel switching system, data acquisition and system control enabled fuel flexible operation of a Wankel engine of 4. 97 cc displacement. The maximum mechanical power produced from Gasoline, Glowfuel (methanol+nitromethane mix), JP 8, Diesel and Biodiesel were 334 W, 508 W, 313 W, 239 W and 322 W respectively. Methanol did not require active glowplug power while the 87 octane, diesel and JP 8 fuels did. Good throttle response for both Methanol and JP 8 was observed however the 87 octane operation, there was little to no throttle response during combustion. This dissertation research clearly demonstrates that small-scale Wankel rotary engines are fuel flexible across at least 6 different fuels: methanol, gasoline, diesel, JP 8, biodiesel and ethanol. This dissertation is broken down into six separate chapters: Chapter 1 Introduction that describes the motivations and background of this research, Chapter 2 : Theory which gets the reader up to speed with the relevant engineering concepts, Chapter 3 : Experimental Setup Design which describes how the fuel flexible characterization system was built, Chapter 4 : Experimental Results which succinctly presents all data key data collected during this research, Chapter 5 : Discussion and Analysis which are the conclusions drawn from the captured data and Chapter 6 : Conclusions which briefly reiterates the key developments presented in this dissertation. It is the hopes of the author that this research serves as a stepping stone in future development efforts and allows science and technology to arrive at a point where wide range and robust fuel flexibility is possible...|$|R
