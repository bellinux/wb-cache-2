5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{political}} discussion <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> building a stadium, beginning in the 1990s when a Maryland location was chosen for what is now FedExField. With the possibility of building a new stadium in the near future, both the previous and current mayors of the District of Columbia have stated that a name change {{must be part of}} the discussion, however the team rejects that possibiltiy. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has met with the owner to discuss the building of a new stadium in Virginia. For many years, beginning with the departure of the Baltimore Colts, the Redskins were the only NFL team in a large area from Maryland into the southern states. This is slowly changing as Maryland NFL fans move to the Baltimore Ravens. Several Maryland politicians have stated that the name should change, but the current governor opposes any change, also citing the desire to keep the stadium in Maryland. Virginia fans are now the more numerous and dedicated supporters of the Redskins, and the state and local governments have used economic incentives to encourage the team's relocation of its facilities there, and maintain that the name is entirely a business decision for the team to make. An agency of the commonwealth, the Virginia Lottery, is a sponsor of the team, and says it has never had any complaints.|$|E

25|$|High {{levels of}} {{inflation}} {{have also been}} associated with a growth in Iran's money supply. The Central Bank's {{data suggest that the}} money supply growth <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> 40% annually. The rapid growth of money supply came from high demands for borrowing capital at the rate of 12% the banks offer, imposed by the Government to make credit accessible to average Iranians and small entrepreneurs. However, this rate is lower than the rate of inflation. This makes the cost of borrowing less than free market cost as determined by supply and demand, based on the inflation rate and investment risk.|$|E

25|$|The Factbook {{is full of}} usually minor errors, inaccuracies, and {{out-of-date}} information, {{which are}} often repeated elsewhere due to the Factbooks widespread use as a reference. For example, Albania was until recently, described in the Factbook as 70% Muslim, 20% Eastern Orthodox, and 10% Roman Catholic, {{which was based on}} a survey conducted in 1939, before World War II; numerous surveys conducted since the fall of the Communist regime since 1990 have given quite different figures. Another example is Singapore, which the Factbook states has a total fertility rate of 0.78 children per woman, despite figures in Statistics Singapore which state that the rate <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> 1.2–1.3 children per woman for at least the past several years, and it is unclear when, or even whether, it ever dropped as low as 0.78. This low and inaccurate value then gets cited in news articles which state that Singapore has the world's lowest fertility, or at least use the figure for its shock value. Another serious problem is that the Factbook never cites its sources, making verification of the information it presents difficult if not impossible.|$|E

[...] "It's the idea that some things are in some real sense really you, or express what you and others aren't...

500|$|Arctic islands {{north of}} Norway, Finland and Russia have all shown {{evidence}} of glacier retreat. In the Svalbard archipelago, {{the island of}} Spitsbergen has numerous glaciers. Research indicates that Hansbreen (Hans Glacier) on Spitsbergen retreated [...] from 1936 to 1982 and another [...] during the 16-year period from 1982 to 1998.

They appreciated the authenticity of the story, and I think that comes from the character and storylines being based on other people's real life experiences." [...] Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun branded Chris Erinsborough's token gay. He added [...] "Good on Neighbours for not having their gay character flouncing around in a midriff top listening to Britney Spears." [...] Inside Soap's staff said that they could not wait to see how Chris would get on with Aidan. They added that it was [...] "high time he had a boyfriend". Of the Chris and Scotty storyline, Melinda Houston from The Sun-Herald wrote [...] "Good on Neighbours for not just having an ongoing gay character but using him to explore some interesting issues.|$|E
