40|$|Abstract This paper {{analyzes}} {{the differences in}} the manifestation of strength performance between groups of seven-year-old male Macedonian students with different level of <b>explosive</b> <b>strength</b> abilities. A total number of 120 children were measured in 11 motor tests used for estimation of explosive, repetitive and static strength qualities. Tests hypothetically used for estimation of <b>explosive</b> <b>strength</b> were factorized with component factor analysis. Orthogonal varimax factors were defined and factor scores of participants were calculated using К-means clustering procedure in order to determine groups of students with under average (low), average (medium) and above (<b>high)</b> average <b>explosive</b> <b>strength</b> qualities. Group univariant differences among all analyzed variables were also assessed using ANOVA analysis. It was concluded that both: defined latent dimensions of relative manifestation of <b>explosive</b> <b>strength</b> of upper part of the body and the absolute strength of lower body parts have a significant and specific influence on the success of manifestation of strength performance in students at this age. This type of findings should be used as a base for determining the qualitative physical education teaching programmes and academic standards.

40|$|Background: Boxing {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} combat sports where {{different}} anthropological and fitness ability parameters determine performance. It is characterized by short duration, high intensity bursts of activity. The purpose of this research was to determine anthropometric and physical fitness profile of male elite and non-elite boxers of Manipur and to compare the two groups. Materials and Methods: Nineteen subjects were selected as elite boxers and twenty-four were non-elite boxers of Manipur. A cross-sectional study was conducted on anthropometric measurements and physical fitness ability tests on 33 subjects (elite and non-elite boxers). Statistical analysis was done using descriptive statistics, t-test and logistic regression with the help of SPSS version 15 software. Results: Results showed elite boxers have significantly reduced neck girth and calf girth as compare to non-elite boxers. Elite boxers have significantly lower sub scapular skin fold (SSF) and supra iliac skin fold (SISF) than their counterparts. Higher stature, larger BTB and lower percent fat are associated with higher performance in boxing. Sit ups (SU), standing Broad Jump (SBJ), Plat taping (PT), Sit and reach (SAR) and Harvard Step Test (HST) are predicted as most contributing factors enhancing performance level among the physical fitness components. Elite boxers are found to have more functional <b>strength</b> (sit ups), <b>higher</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>strength</b> (SBJ), more agility (PT), cardio-vascular endurance and flexibility (SAR) than non-elite boxers. Conclusion: In conclusion, lower fat, higher lean body mass, larger bi-trochantric breadth, <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>strength,</b> agility and flexibility are significantly associated with higher performance and chance of becoming elite boxers...|$|R

40|$|A força é das capacidades motoras a mais importante para o movimento. Visto que não há movimento em que a mesma não se faça presente. Desta forma, a força se torna importante para as atividades competitivas e recreativas. O que nos leva a sugerir que o desenvolvimento da força faça parte dos planejamentos das aulas de Educação Física. Portanto este estudo teve por objetivo verificar a eficácia de um programa de treinamento de força nas aulas de Educação Física em adolescentes do sexo masculino com idades variando entre 10 e 14 anos. E, também, o resultado do treinamento nas suas expressões de força máxima, força {{explosiva}} e força-resistência dos escolares. Participaram do estudo 230 alunos do sexo masculino (10 a 14 anos), após assinarem um termo de consentimento. O grupo experimental (GE= 131) participou do programa de treinamento durante 12 semanas, duas vezes por semana. Os exercícios realizados eram pliométricos e calistênicos, sem uso de aparelhos. A execução dos exercícios se deu em forma de circuito. O tempo de treinamento era de 15 minutos durante as aulas de Educação Física. O grupo controle (GC= 99) não participou das atividades especificas para o desenvolvimento da força, mas mantiveram as atividades normais das aulas de Educação Física. A força máxima, a força explosiva e a força de resistência foram avaliadas através dos testes de abdominal, salto em distância, arremesso de bola medicinal, dinamometria de mão e barra modificada. Para análise descritiva foram utilizadas a média e o desvio padrão. Às comparações intra-grupos, utilizou-se o teste t pareado e para as comparações inter-grupos, o teste U de Mann-Whitney. Para verificar o poder de observação utilizou-se o Teste Medidas Repetidas. O nível de significância adotado foi 5 %. Para verificar a influência da maturação, utilizou-se a Análise de Medidas Repetidas, com covariância da maturação. O grupo experimental apresentou, em todos os testes analisados, aumentos significativos. Já o grupo controle apresentou, em alguns testes, aumentos na média, porém não de forma significativa. Na comparação dos valores inter-grupos observamos que em todos os testes analisados o grupo experimental apresentou aumentos maiores e significativos do que o grupo controle. Na análise de medidas repetidas co-variando a maturação verificou-se influência estatisticamente significativa em alguns testes e em algumas idades. Os resultados mostraram que, para esta amostra, o programa de treinamento de força foi eficaz para aumento das três expressões de força no grupo experimental. E que 12 semanas não foram suficientes para que o grupo controle mostrasse aumentos significativos nas três expressões de força. Strength {{is of the}} coordenative capacities {{the most}} important for movement, once there is no movement {{in which it is}} not present. This way, strength becomes important for competitive and recreational activities. It takes us to suggest that strength development might be part of physical education plans. It said, this study aims to check how effective a strength training program in physical education classes for male teenagers, aging between 10 and 14 years old is. And also the results of the training in its expression of <b>highest</b> <b>strength,</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>strength</b> and resistant strength of students. 230 male students participated of the study (10 to 14 years old) after signing a consent term. The experimental term (GE= 131) participated of the program during 12 weeks, twice a week. The exercises developed were “pliométrico” and “calestiano”, without the usage of appliances. The execution of the exercises was made as circuit. The duration of the training was of 15 minutes during the physical education classes. The control group (GC= 99) did not participate of the specific activities strength development, but kept doing normal activites. The maximum <b>strength,</b> the <b>explosive</b> <b>strength</b> and the resistant strength were evaluated through abdominal tests, distance jump, medicinal ball throwing, hand “dinamometria” and modified bars. For descriptive analisis, the average and the pattern deviation were used. The comparisons within groups used the test t in pair and for the comparisons inter-groups the test U of Mann-Whitney. To check the power of observation, the Repetitive Measure Test was used. The level of significance adopted was of 5 %. To check the influence of maturation the Repetitive Measure Analisis was used, with co-range of maturation. The experimental group presented in every test meaningful enhance. The control group presented in some tests enhance in the average but not in a meaningful way. In the comparison of the inter-group values, it was observed that in every analised test the experimental group presented greater and more meaningful enhance than the control group. In the analisis of repetitive measures, co-ranging, maturation, statistically meaningful influence was observed in some tests and in some ages. The results showed that for this sample the strength training program was effective for enhancing three expressions of strength in the experimental group.

40|$|According to the {{research}} on the sample of 256 footballers aged 10 - 12 and the battery including 20 tests for evaluation of the basic motor abilities and the battery of 24 tests for evaluation of specifi c preciseness, and as per canonic-correlation analysis, a general conclusion can be reached that the boys were rather different in their basic motor abilities. The differences were especially <b>high</b> in <b>explosive</b> <b>strength,</b> coordination, aerobic endurance and balance. One could also conclude that the sample treated in this manner (10 - 12 years of age) is very heterogeneous with respect to basic motor abilities. The subjects showed the highest homogeneity in the tests of specifi c preciseness. They also achieved particularly good results in the tests of vertical target hitting by leg and head. Considering the relations of the basic motor abilities and specifi c preciseness, {{it was concluded that}} the structure-based basic motor-canonic factor might be interpreted as FACTOR OF SPEED ENDURANCE AND <b>EXPLOSIVE</b> <b>STRENGTH,</b> whereas structurebased canonic factor of specifi c preciseness might be interpreted as the FACTOR OF SPECIFIC PRECISENESS OF VERTICAL TARGET HITTING BY LEG AND HEAD. The structure of the relations of the fi rst pair of canonic factors indicates that footballers with lower speed endurance and lower <b>explosive</b> <b>strength</b> achieved poorer results in the tests of specifi c preciseness of vertical target hitting by leg and head, and vice versa. Structure of the relations of the second canonic factor indicates quite clearly that the footballers with lower repetitive strength achieved lower results in the tests of specifi c preciseness of horizontal and vertical target by leg and head in a newly created situation. Here of course, the opposite was true, i. e. footballers with <b>higher</b> repetitive <b>strength</b> were better in these tests too...|$|R

A group of 185 freshman physical education students (118 males; 67 females {{of the same age}} (18. 3 +/- 0. 5 years) trained under the same conditions and were exposed to similar extrinsic risk factors.

Although dynamic strength seems to be an important risk factor in acute injuries, sports accidents must be seen in relation to psychological factors. However, the overuse-prone profile is mainly based on physical traits: a combination of muscle weakness, ligamentous laxity, and muscle tightness predisposes to stress injuries. In addition, these overuse effects are intensified by large body weight and length, a <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>strength,</b> and malalignment of the lower limbs. Nevertheless, it has to be kept in mind that psychosomatic factors play a role in how one experiences these overuse phenomena. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{quantification}} of genetic and environmental sources of variation in physical fitness components in 105 10 -yr-old twin pairs and their parents. Nine motor tests and six skinfold measures were administered. Motor tests {{can be divided into}} those that are performance-related: static <b>strength,</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>strength,</b> running speed, speed of limb movement, and balance; and those that are health-related: trunk strength, functional strength, maximum oxygen uptake, and flexibility. The significance and contribution of genetic and environmental factors to variation in physical fitness were tested with model fitting. Performance-related fitness characteristics were moderately to highly heritable. The heritability estimates were slightly higher for health-related fitness characteristics. For most variables a simple model including genetic and specific environmental factors fitted the observed phenotypic variance well. Common environmental factors explained {{a significant part of the}} variation in speed components and flexibility. Assortative mating was significant and positive for speed components, balance, trunk strength, and cardiorespiratory fitness, but negative for adiposity.

Moreover, the provisions of European design standard for steel structures, Eurocode 3, were validated with test results of <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> steel endplate connections. Findings – In endplate connections, a proper design using a thinner <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> steel endplate can achieve the same failure mode, similar residual load bearing capacity and comparable or even higher rotation capacity after cooling down from fire. It is found that <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> steel endplate connection can regain more than 90 per cent of its original load bearing capacity after cooling down from fire temperature of 550 °C. Originality/value – The post-fire performance of <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> steel endplate connection has been reported. The accuracy of Eurocode 3 for endplate connections is validated against test results.

40|$|Abstract: Performance of <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> {{concrete}} and ordinary concrete under alternating action of mixed erosion and freeze-thaw cycling were compared. The erosion solution was mixed by weight of 3 % sodium chloride and 5 % sodium sulfate. Results showed that, after 200 freeze-thaw cycles, {{the effect of}} surface scaling of ordinary concrete was more significant than that of <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> concrete, and the mass loss rate of ordinary concrete was much higher; The relative dynamic modulus of elasticity of <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> concrete slightly increased by 2. 99 %, while that of ordinary concrete decreased more than 13 %. Compressive strength and elastic modulus of <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> and ordinary concrete behaved almost {{in the same way}} in the first 50 freeze-thaw cycles, with the increase of freeze-thaw cycles in the following test, the compressive strength and elastic modulus of ordinary concrete showed larger reductions than these of <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> concrete. As the freeze-thaw cycles increased, the corresponding strain to the peak stress of <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> concrete decreased, but it increased for ordinary concrete...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHot-stamped <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> {{steel parts}} {{are widely used}} to achieve {{lightweight}} of automobile. However, mechanical properties of formed <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> steel parts are difficult to control and predict. In order to realize field nondestructive testing of hot forming <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> steel parts, magnetic Barkhausen noise which is sensitive to microstructure of ferromagnet was used. In the paper, magnetic Barkhausen noise signals of hot-stamped <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> steel strips with different hardness were measured and analyzed. A substantial correlation was found between magnetic Barkhausen noise and hardness (in range 220 ∼ 450 HV). Then, frequency domain analysis based on autoregressive modeling was done to find out signal components which are dependent and independent to hardness of the hot-stamped <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> steel. Independent signals can be eliminated based on the frequency analysis. Accordingly, the measurement accuracy can be improved for application in industrial field...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1960 's the first <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> glass fibers, S-glass, were {{developed}} in joint work between Owens Corning and the US Air Force. Today <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> glasses with various batch formulations are manufactured commercially by several companies in every major economic region. The utility of <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> glass fiber compositions are compared by physical, mechanical, electrical, thermal, and optical properties. The influence of filament diameter, over the range 9 - 26 microns, and size chemistry on composite mechanical performance is described, in epoxy and vinyl/polyester resins. Data on <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> glass composites reinforced with UD fiber and fabrics are reported from 55 °C to 80 °C...|$|R
