5000|$|Roughing or Finishing: Different {{types of}} cutter are {{available}} for cutting away large amounts of material, leaving a poor surface finish (roughing), or removing a smaller amount of material, but leaving a good surface finish (finishing). A roughing cutter may have serrated teeth for breaking the chips of material into smaller pieces. These teeth leave a rough surface behind. A <b>finishing</b> <b>cutter</b> may have a large number (4 or more) teeth for removing material carefully. However, {{the large number of}} flutes leaves little room for efficient swarf removal, so they are less appropriate for removing large amounts of material.|$|E
5000|$|Helix angle: The flutes of a {{milling cutter}} are almost always helical. If the flutes were straight, the whole tooth would impact the {{material}} at once, causing vibration and reducing accuracy and surface quality. Setting the flutes at an angle allows the tooth to enter the material gradually, reducing vibration. Typically, <b>finishing</b> <b>cutters</b> have a higher rake angle (tighter helix) to give a better finish.|$|R

5|$|Integrity {{was laid}} down in September 1802 at the newly opened King's Dockyard in the colony of New South Wales. Governor Philip Gidley King ordered that {{construction}} proceed as swiftly as possible, {{in order to test}} the Dockyard's capacity. A team of two shipwrights, two apprentice shipwrights and two sawyers were assigned the task and delivered the <b>finished</b> <b>cutter</b> in thirteen months. During construction shipwright Thomas Moore tested that the hull was watertight by filling it with water from the inside, and repairing any visible leaks. Her hold also incorporated a partition that her crew could move to or away from the forecastle bulkhead to vary her cargo capacity.|$|R

60|$|They were a week {{on board}} before the <b>cutter</b> <b>finished</b> her trip at Whitby. Both boys had done their best to acquire knowledge, and had learnt {{the names of the}} ropes and their uses {{by the time they got}} to port.|$|R
500|$|His task <b>finished,</b> <b>Cutter</b> {{leaves the}} theater and passes a {{stranger}} on the street. The stranger shoots Angier and reveals himself as Borden. Angier realizes that [...] "Alfred Borden" [...] is actually an identity assumed by twin brothers who took turns being Borden and Fallon; the twin who loved his hanged wife Sarah, {{and the one who}} loved the assistant Olivia. Fallon loved Olivia and is the more hot headed of the two brothers; he is the twin who, despite promising not to return to Angier's show, does so and is caught. Fallon, having exacerbated Sarah's depression which leads to her suicide, is the twin who is hanged. The surviving twin is Sarah's husband. Borden berates Angier for going too far in his quest for dominance. Angier explains that giving his audience a moment of wonder, and to bask in their applause, was his great ambition. Angier dies as his fallen lantern sets the theater on fire. Borden picks up his daughter, Jess, at Cutter's workshop. A final glimpse of the burning theater shows what looks like the body of Angier in a water tank near the dead body.|$|R

50|$|In 2011 it was {{announced}} Paul Bramley {{was announced}} from his contract and signed with Burleigh. The cutters signed the best possible replacement, Anthony Seibold a former Brisbane Broncos player, ESL club Crusaders assistant coach, South Wales scorpions coach and Wales assistant test coach. The <b>Cutters</b> <b>finished</b> a disappointing 11th in 2011 after an injury havok season where the squad used 43 players. The Cutters also made a major coup by signing former Warriors and Cowboys half Grant Rovelli who had 95 NRL games to his name. He was a star player for the QLD Residents match played in 2011.|$|R
50|$|Laser cutting is a {{technology}} that uses a laser to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting {{to be used by}} schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the material or the laser beam generated. A typical commercial laser for cutting materials would involve a motion control system to follow a CNC or G-code of the pattern to be cut onto the material. The focused laser beam is directed at the material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas, leaving an edge with a high-quality surface <b>finish.</b> Industrial laser <b>cutters</b> are used to cut flat-sheet material as well as structural and piping materials.|$|R
40|$|Ball end cutters, {{flat end}} cutters and fillet end cutters {{are used for}} {{finishing}} sculptured surfaces. Ball end cutter permits the access to concave zones but gives a bad surface <b>finish.</b> The other <b>cutters</b> produce a good surface finish and their material removal rate and feed rate are important compared to ball end cutters. To optimize the finishing of sculptured surfaces, it is more efficient to choose firstly flat end cutters and fillet end cutters for machining a maximum area and secondly choose ball end cutters for inaccessible zones by {{taking into account the}} existence of regions of different local forms. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to optimize the finishing of sculptured surfaces from their STL models on 3 -axis CNC milling machines by the selection of the adequate cutters from a given combination of cutters forms. This methodology: 1) determines the parameters of points and triangles, 2) estimates the unit normal vectors, 3) identify the local forms of points and triangles, 4) creates the regions 5) selects the forms and the dimensions of the adequate cutters...|$|R
50|$|In 1893, Cutter {{submitted}} {{a letter to}} the trustees that he would not seek to renew his contract {{at the end of the}} year. Fortunately for him, there was an opportunity in Northampton, Massachusetts. Judge Charles E. Forbes left a considerable amount of money to the town to start a library. This was Cutter’s chance to institute his ideas from the ground up. He developed a cataloging system called the expansive classification system. It was to have seven levels of classification, each with increasing specificity. Thus small libraries who did not like having to deal with unnecessarily long classification numbers could use lower levels and still be specific enough for their purpose. Larger libraries could use the more specific tables since they needed to be more specific to keep subjects separate. Unfortunately, he died in 1903 before he could <b>finish.</b> At Forbes, <b>Cutter</b> set up the art and music department and encouraged children of nearby schools to exhibit their art. He also established branch libraries and instituted a traveling library system much like the bookmobile. Today, Charles Ammi Cutter might be surprised to see his own portrait hanging over the reference librarians' desk in the Forbes Library in Northampton. His roll top desk is also in the office currently occupied by the recently elected director of the library.|$|R
5000|$|Not {{originally}} on the World Cup or Olympic {{teams in}} 1968, Cutter, age 18, and Judy Nagel, age 16, were brought over to Europe in January, {{a few weeks}} ahead of the Olympics, to compete for berths on the U.S. Olympic team, which they both made. Cutter competed with the team at the Grenoble Olympics in 1968 and the World Championships in 1970. In the 1968 games, she placed higher than any American woman and was the only American woman to ski in all three events—slalom, giant slalom, and downhill. Following the Olympic competition, her rise to stardom continued in Norway, with her first World Cup victory at age 18. <b>Cutter</b> <b>finished</b> ninth in the overall standings in 1968. With three World Cup wins the next year (giant slalom at Oberstaufen, West Germany, and slalom victories at Mount St. Anne, Quebec, and Waterville Valley, New Hampshire), she finished fourth in the overall standings and second in slalom in 1969. Cutter won her fifth and final World Cup race at St. Gervais, France, in 1970. During her brief amateur career, Cutter had five World Cup victories, twelve podiums, and 25 top-10 finishes, all in the technical events, with one victory and two podiums in giant slalom and the rest in slalom. [...] After the 1970 World Championships in mid-February, Cutter retired from international competition at age 20. She raced professionally on the Women's Pro Tour in North America for several years.|$|R
