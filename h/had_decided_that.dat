5|$|In autumn 1943, Hergé <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> {{he wanted}} Jacobs to {{collaborate}} with him on The Adventures of Tintin. Although initially hesitant, Jacobs eventually agreed, adopting the paid position in January 1944. Jacobs and Hergé became close collaborators and greatly influenced each other, while together they developed the plot for the next Adventure of Tintin, The Seven Crystal Balls, which began serialisation in Le Soir in December 1943.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{was educated}} at various primary schools {{as the family}} moved with his father's postings before being sent to Stamford School, an {{independent}} boarding school in south Lincolnshire, where he became a house prefect. He joined the school's Combined Cadet Force along with John Drewienkiewicz, who eventually became a major general. By the age of 15 Jackson <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> {{he wanted to be}} a soldier.|$|E
5|$|We incline to {{the view}} that on his abdication the Duke of Windsor could not have claimed the right to be {{described}} as a Royal Highness. In other words, no reasonable objection could have been taken if the King <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> his exclusion from the lineal succession excluded him from the right to this title as conferred by the existing Letters Patent.|$|E

5|$|Apart from Captain Kirk, {{the episode}} {{introduced}} two other regular characters to the show: James Doohan, {{a friend of}} director James Goldstone, was cast as the Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott (the name chosen after Doohan had tried various accents, and <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> an engineer ought to be Scottish) and George Takei was cast as Ship's Physicist Sulu, who would become the helmsman in the regular series. Lieutenant Uhura and Dr. Leonard McCoy do not feature; the ship's doctor is instead Mark Piper (Paul Fix). Piper {{was intended as a}} regular; DeForest Kelley, who played McCoy in the series proper, had been considered for the role.|$|E
5|$|By 5 November, General Headquarters (GHQ) South West Pacific Area (SWPA) <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> the Finschhafen {{area would}} be {{developed}} into a major air and naval base, but the large Japanese force on Sattelberg still overlooked the base area. In order to remove this threat, Wootten sent the 26th Infantry Brigade to capture Sattelberg on 16 November. On 25 November, after 10 days of fighting, and an advance up the southern approaches from Jivevaneng by infantry supported by artillery, armour and air support, Sattelberg was seized by the Australians. Having suffered heavy casualties, and short on supplies, the Japanese withdrew north to Wareo, where they established themselves in preparation for further attacks by the Australians.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis in November 1944, John O. Gottlieb, a friend of Chandler's in the War Department, {{suggested}} Chandler as a successor. Baseball owners who had been afraid that their players would be made eligible for the draft during the war <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> their new commissioner needed to have the skills and influence to represent baseball's interests in Washington, D. C. As a senator, Chandler had advocated on behalf of baseball during the war, endearing him to the owners. Furthermore, the commissioner's $50,000 annual salary—about five times that of a US senator at the time—proved a significant enticement, and Chandler agreed {{to be considered for}} the job.|$|E

5|$|His most {{successful}} intruder operation {{took place on}} the night of the 17/18 August 1943, when he participated in 100 Group's support of RAF Bomber Command's Operation Hydra. Braham <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> it was best to employ the British night fighters in a freelance role. Instead of operating over known German airfields, he elected to interpose the Beaufighters between the outward bomber stream and German airfields in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. He hoped that the echoes made by the Beaufighters on the German Lichtenstein radar would attract enemy aircraft and divert them from the bombers.|$|E
5|$|In early July, a {{few days}} after a communist-led mass {{uprising}} commenced, Aćimović reshuffled his government, replacing three commissioners and appointing deputies for most of the portfolios. By mid-July, the Germans <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> the Aćimović regime was incompetent and unable to deal with the uprising, and began looking for a replacement. At the end of August this resulted in the resignation of the Commissioner Government and the appointment of the Government of National Salvation led by former Minister of the Army and Navy General Milan Nedić, in which Aćimović initially retained the Interior portfolio.|$|E
5|$|Maxim Gorky {{tested the}} first Soviet naval helicopter, the Kamov Ka-10 in December 1950 and began her refit in mid-1953. This was planned {{to include a}} {{complete}} overhaul of her machinery while her radar, fire-control systems and anti-aircraft guns were {{to be replaced by}} the latest Soviet systems. Torpedo bulges were to be fitted which would increase her displacement by , with consequent penalties to her speed and range. The navy re-evaluated the scope of the work in 1955 and deemed it insufficient to create a fully modern ship and suspended the refit. Maxim Gorky was sold for scrapping on 18 April 1959 after the navy <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> she wasn't needed as a missile-test ship.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, other European powers <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> {{it was not}} {{in their}} {{interest}} that any one power should dominate the Baltic Sea. After long negotiations, known as the first Concert of the Hague, England sent a large fleet of 43 ships with more than 2,000 cannons. The force did not directly participate in fighting but nevertheless sent a clear message to the Dutch fleet patrolling the Danish waters. England worked hard to broker a peace, aided by France which also declared its willingness to help the Swedes if the Danes refused to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|The McMahon {{government}} had consisted of 27ministers, twelve of whom comprised the Cabinet. In {{the run-up to}} the election, the Labor caucus <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> should the party take power, all 27ministers were to be Cabinet members. Intense canvassing took place amongst ALP parliamentarians as the duumvirate did its work, and on 18 December the caucus elected the Cabinet. The results were generally acceptable to Whitlam, and within three hours, he had announced the portfolios of the Cabinet members. To give himself greater control over the Cabinet, in January 1973 Whitlam established five Cabinet committees (with the members appointed by himself, not the caucus) and took full control of the Cabinet agenda.|$|E
5|$|The Minister <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> the Jehovah's Witnesses' {{doctrine}} prohibiting its adherents {{from taking}} part in military service was contrary to national security and, thus, to public order and the public interest. Notably, the Court held that because {{the basis for the}} Minister's conclusion clearly could not be disputed, {{there was no need for}} any hearing or inquiry as no purpose would have been achieved. The appellants had not shown that the Minister had based his conclusions on false or unfounded facts; thus, unless the conclusions were irrelevant, the Court could not interfere with the Minister's opinion since his discretionary power had been exercised within statutory limitations.|$|E

5|$|The Naval Ministry {{solicited}} new bids on 8 September from 23 shipbuilders, {{domestic and}} foreign, but only seven responded, {{even after the}} deadline was extended by a month. A number of designs were rejected for not meeting the revised criteria. In the meantime, the Artillery Section of the Main Administration of Shipbuilding <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> it preferred a four-turret design, and new bids were solicited in May 1912 from the leading contenders from {{the first round of}} bidding. The eventual winner was a design by the Admiralty Works in Saint Petersburg, which had the extra turret added to a new hull section inserted into the original three-turret design.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Parliament gave 400,000 kroner {{in support}} in 1873, and doubled it the {{following}} year. By then, the Swedish authorities <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> all railways should {{be built in}} standard gauge, and the Norwegian Parliament chose to change their configuration to the same gauge in 1874, increasing estimated costs from 4.7 to 8.9 million kroner. This was a similar arrangement to what would happen with the two international lines in Eastern Norway, where the Kongsvinger and Østfold Lines were also built with standard gauge. Despite intense lobbying from representatives from Innherred, the Verdal alternative was finally discarded when parliament gave 3 million kroner to the Meråker Line.|$|E
5|$|The roll of honour was not {{completed}} as quickly. After {{a series of}} budget reductions, it was delivered in June 1929 but was of poor quality, {{and in the meantime}} the trustees of the castle museum <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> the castle was not an appropriate place for the roll to be kept. It had also exceeded the reduced budget of £500, though Lutyens waived his fee and offered to pay the difference. The trustees changed their minds after improvements were made to the quality, and the roll of honour was installed in the castle on 13 January 1931 without ceremony as a result of embarrassment over the delay.|$|E

5|$|When it {{came time}} to {{translate}} The Black Island, which is set in Great Britain, the opportunity was taken to make the scenes more true-to-life; such as ensuring that the British police were unarmed and ensuring scenes of the British countryside were more accurate for discerning British readers. Methuen <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> the book did not portray Great Britain accurately enough, and had compiled a list of 131 errors of detail, which should be put right, asking Studios Hergé to rework it completely. The resulting album is the dramatically updated and redrawn 1966 version that is the most commonly available today. , Egmont publishes Tintin books in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|A {{public enquiry}} {{was held in}} 1873, to {{determine}} whether it would be advantageous for the city to be administered by a municipal corporation. The result being in the affirmative, the city council, sometimes archaically called the corporation, was founded by a Charter of Incorporation dated 17 March 1874, under the government of a mayor, six aldermen and 18 councillors. Something of an anomaly, the Parliamentary Boundary Commission of 1868 <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> the urban parts of Fletton and Woodston were so involved in Peterborough that they ought to be in the borough and added the newly built-up portions of these parishes to the parliamentary constituency. In local matters they were still in Huntingdonshire and, as the City of Peterborough did not extend south of the River Nene, the full title of the new municipality was the City and Borough of Peterborough and its inhabitants, citizens and burgesses.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by {{the raid}} on Genoa, the {{authorities}} in Leghorn ordered Impérieuse to leave immediately. The frigate sailed north and took shelter at Fezzano, near the port of La Spezia. The French <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> since capture was inevitable, the frigate should be destroyed, and beached the ship in order to remove guns and stores. Six days after the capture of Modeste, Captain reached La Spezia, acting on reports that Impérieuse was in the bay. Reeve discovered the French ship under the guns of the Santa Maria shore battery, and the following morning, 12 October, used his ship's boats to tow Captain alongside Impérieuse. At 08:00 boat parties from the ship of the line boarded the frigate, discovering that the remaining French crew had abandoned their disarmed ship during the night and scuttled it in shallow water. The British {{were able to take}} possession of Impérieuse without opposition from the battery. Reeve instructed his carpenters to make the frigate seaworthy again, refloating the ship and completing temporary repairs on 13 October before sailing back to Toulon with his prize.|$|E
