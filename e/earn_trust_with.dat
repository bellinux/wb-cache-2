40|$|The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} the Online Social Networks (OSNs) OSNsOnline Social Networks has made the OSNs major targets of spammers. They aim to illegally gather private information from users and spread spam to them. In this paper, we propose a new spam campaign that includes following key steps: creating fake accounts, picking legitimate accounts, forming friendships, <b>earning</b> <b>trust,</b> and spreading spam. The unique part in our spam campaign {{is the process of}} <b>earning</b> <b>trust.</b> By using social bots, we significantly lower the cost of <b>earning</b> <b>trust</b> and make it feasible in the real world. By spreading spam at a relatively low speed, we make the life span of our fake accounts much longer than in traditional spam campaigns. This means the <b>trust</b> we have <b>earned</b> can be used multiple times instead of only one time in traditional spam campaigns. We evaluate our spam campaign by comparing it with the traditional campaign, and the comparison shows that our spam campaign is less detectable and more efficient than the traditional campaign...|$|R

5000|$|Following {{the conquest}} of Gojoseon by Han China in 108 BC, the {{surviving}} tribes and city-states of Manchuria and the northern Korean Peninsula are harshly subjugated as tributaries to the Han, who are portrayed as ruling with an iron fist from the Four Commanderies. Haemosu, {{the leader of the}} local resistance {{in the form of the}} Damul Army, covertly teams up with Prince Geumwa of Buyeo to defend and rescue Gojoseon refugees throughout the land. After being injured in a battle, Haemosu is rescued by Lady Yuhwa of the Chinese deity of the Yellow River Habaek tribe (to whom Geumwa has taken a fancy), and they fall in love. Haemosu is subsequently ambushed and captured by Han forces (and after falling off a cliff is presumed dead by the outside world), and the now-pregnant Lady Yuhwa is forced to seek shelter in Buyeo, where she becomes Geumwa's concubine and gives birth to Haemosu's son, Jumong.Twenty years later, the young Jumong is a weak and cowardly prince overshadowed and scorned by his elder half-brothers Daeso and Youngpo, who are vying for inheritance of the Buyeo throne from their father (the now-King Geumwa). After escaping an assassination attempt by his half-brothers, Jumong leaves the palace and by a twist of fate, encounters his father, the now-elderly Haemosu in the wild. Jumong becomes skilled in combat under Haemosu's covert tutelage, but is unaware of their father-son relationship. At the same time, Jumong forms a close relationship with Lady Soseono of the Gyeru trading clan of Jolbon. Following Haemosu's assassination by Daeso and Youngpo, Jumong learns the truth and vows to avenge his father and drive out the Han. He returns to Geumwa and leads the Buyeo army in a campaign against Lintun and Zhenfan Commanderies, but is reported missing in action and presumed dead following an injury in battle. Subsequently, Daeso seizes power in Buyeo by colluding with Xuantu Commandery and forces Soseono to be his queen. In desperation, Soseono weds her trading partner Wootae (not knowing Jumong is still alive). Jumong, however, is rescued by the Hanbaek tribe and nursed back to health by Lady Yesoya, whom he weds. They return to Buyeo and Jumong feigns servitude to Daeso, thereby <b>earning</b> his <b>trust.</b> <b>With</b> Daeso's guard down, Jumong and his lieutenants manage to intercept and lead a large group of Gojoseon refugees into the wilds of Mount Bongye, where they establish a fortress and re-form the Damul Army, against Geumwa's wishes. In despite, Geumwa holds Yesoya and her son Yuri hostage in the palace, after regaining power from Daeso.|$|R
