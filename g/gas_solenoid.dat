In the mid-50s, Marotta developed the balanced poppet valve concept and the 6000 psi solenoid valve. In the late-50s Marotta extended its pressure regulating products to include electrical and remote control applications.

40|$|The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) is {{the support}} center for wild land {{firefighting}} in the US located in Boise, ID. One {{of the many}} activities that the NIFC coordinates is prescribed burns. Prescribed burns are one of NIFC’smanagement tools to help prevent major forest fires by burning undergrowth and they also help with maintaining and improving habitat. Recently, NIFC has decommissioned their prescribed burn apparatus {{due to lack of}} safety specifications, the Terra-Torch, produced by Firecon, based out of Ontario, Oregon. Last year, Boise State University produced a burn apparatus prototype for NIFC to replace the Terra-Torch. Although last year’sprototype was better than the Terra-Torch, NIFC wants Boise State University to re-engineer the apparatus utilizing standard parts with certain safety ratings such as the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) rating. Our group has focused on re-engineering the ergonomics and robustness of last year’sapparatus using standardized parts. We have focused our attention to the apparatus’sfront handle and igniter bracket. So far, we have developed a front handle design that will include two switches: one that will control the igniter switch and the other will control both the pump’sclutch and mapp <b>gas</b> <b>solenoid.</b> With this design, we will have a fail-safe system that will protect the operator and others around. The failsafe system will shut down the apparatus in case the operator would happen to fall and or drop the apparatus. This would include extinguishing the flame and disengaging the clutch to the pump. Our design for the igniter bracket include: two hose clamps and a curved flame tip. The two hose clamps and curved flame tip will provide easy adjustability for any weather condition to ensure proper ignition of the gelled fuel. In near future, we plan on relocating the sparker ignition box, and mapp <b>gas</b> <b>solenoid.</b> Once these items are completed, we will have a working prototype. We will first test our prototype with water to ensure that our apparatus is sealed properly. If the water test is a success then by mid March, we plan on testing our prototype with NIFC using the actual gelled fuel. The exact date is unknown at this time due to weather conditions and NIFC’s schedule. Once we have the form of our apparatus finalized, we also plan on having the entire apparatus powder coated Boise State blue and orange...|$|E
40|$|An {{atmosphere}} control subsystem (ACS) {{was developed}} {{for use in a}} closed manned cabin, such as the Space Shuttle Orbiter. This subsystem uses the Perkin Elmer mass spectrometer for continuous measurement of major atmospheric constituents (H 2, H 2 O, N 2, O 2, and CO 2). The O 2 and N 2 analog signals are used as inputs to the controller, which produces a pulse-frequency-modulated output to operate the N 2 <b>gas</b> admission <b>solenoid</b> valve and an on-off signal to operate the O 2 valve. The proportional controller characteristic results in improved control accuracy as compared with previously used on-off controllers having significant dead-band. A 60 -day evaluation test was performed on the ACS during which operation was measured at various values of control setpoint and simulated cabin leakage...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe PDRE test {{model used}} in these {{experiments}} utilized kerosene as the fuel, oxygen as oxidizer, and nitrogen as purge <b>gas.</b> The <b>solenoid</b> valves were employed to control intermittent supplies of kerosene, oxygen and purge gas. PDRE test model was 50 mm in inner diameter by 1. 2 m long. The DDT (deflagration to detonation transition) enhancement device Shchelkin spiral {{was used in the}} test model. The effects of detonation frequency on its time-averaged thrust and specific impulse were experimentally investigated. The obtained results showes that the time-averaged thrust of PDRE test model was approximately proportional to the detonation frequency. For the detonation frequency 20 Hz, the time-averaged thrust was around 107 N, and the specific impulse was around 125 s. The nozzle experiments were conducted using PDRE test model with three traditional nozzles. The experimental results obtained demonstrated that all of those nozzles could augment the thrust and specific impulse. Among those three nozzles, the convergent nozzle had the largest increased augmentation, which was approximately 18 %, under the specific condition of the experiment...|$|R
40|$|The magnetron-style $H^{-}$ ion sources {{currently}} in operation at Fermilab use piezoelectric gas valves to function. This kind of gas valve {{is sensitive to}} small changes in ambient temperature, which affect the stability and performance of the ion source. This motivates the need to find an alternative way of feeding H 2 gas into the source. A solenoid-type gas valve has been characterized in a dedicated off-line test stand to assess the feasibility of its use in the operational ion sources. $H^{-}$ ion beams have been extracted at 35 keV using this valve. In this study, {{the performance of the}} <b>solenoid</b> <b>gas</b> valve has been characterized measuring the beam current output of the magnetron source with respect to the voltage and pulse width of the signal applied to the gas valve.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] novel fluidic gaseous fuel injector, designed for natural gas engines, has been tested and analysed in this paper. The injector is based on the use of a mono-stable fluidic amplifier. Its steady state and dynamic characteristics were tested and compared with several commercial <b>solenoid</b> <b>gas</b> injectors on a laboratory test rig. The results show that the fluidic gas injector is able to handle the large gas flowrates required by natural gas engines with a faster switching response and higher injection stability. Also, the steady state attachment and dynamic switching response of the jet flow in the fluidic amplifier were analysed by a mathematical simulation model. The agreement between predicted and experimental results is shown to be good...|$|R
30|$|A {{source of}} inert gas is {{dynamically}} regulated in software from > 60 psig {{down to two}} different pressures by two analog pressure regulators (ITV 1030 - 31 N 2 L 4 -Q, SMC Corporation). One pressure line drives the pneumatic actuators (typically set to 60 psig), and the other pressure line drives gas flow for liquid transfers and evaporation (typically 3 to 15 psig). The two lines are distributed to actuators and the <b>gas</b> supplier through <b>solenoid</b> valve banks located in the synthesis module. The higher pressure line is used to raise and lower the reaction vessels using pneumatic cylinders (NCDGBN 20 - 0300, SMC Corporation), turn the stopcock valves via the rotary pneumatic actuators (CRB 2 BW 20 - 180 S, SMC Corporation), raise and lower the two z-axis actuators (MXS 8 - 50, SMC Corporation) for the vial gripper and gas supplier, and open and close the vial gripper (MHS 2 - 16 D, SMC Corporation). The lower pressure line feeds into the gas supplier that seals to the gas inlet gaskets {{on top of the}} cassettes, and an external line {{that can be used to}} transfer [18 F]fluoride from a source vial into the anion exchange cartridge on the cassette, for example.|$|R
40|$|This project characterizes crater {{formation}} in a granular material by a jet of gas impinging on a granular material, {{such as a}} retro-rocket landing on the moon. We have constructed a 2 D model of a planetary surface, which consists of a thin, clear box partially filled with granular materials (sand, lunar and Mars simulants [...] .). A metal pipe connected to a tank of nitrogen <b>gas</b> via a <b>solenoid</b> valve is inserted {{into the top of}} the box to model the rocket. The results are recorded using high-speed video. We process these images and videos in order to test existing models and develop new ones for describing crater formation. A similar set-up has been used by Metzger et al. * We find that the long-time shape of the crater is consistent with a predicted catenary shape (Brandenburg). The depth and width of the crater both evolve logarithmically in time, suggesting an analogy to a description in terms of an activated process: dD/dt = A exp(-aD) (D is the crater depth, a and A constants). This model provides a useful context to understand the role of the jet speed, as characterized by the pressure used to drive the flow. The box width also {{plays an important role in}} setting the width of the crater. *P. T. Metzger et al. Journal of Aerospace Engineering (2009) ORBITE...|$|R
40|$|The g- 2 muon storage nng magnet system {{consists}} of four large superconducting solenoids that are up to 15. 1 m in diameter. The g- 2 superconducting solenoids and a superconducting inflector dipole will be cooled using forced two-phase helium in tubes. The forced two-phase helium cooling will be provided from the J-T circuit of a refrigerator {{that is capable of}} delivering 625 W at 4. 5 K. The two-phase helium flows from the refrigerator J-T circuit through a heat exchanger in a storage dewar that acts as a phase separator for helium returning from the magnets. The use of a heat exchanger in the storage dewar reduces the pressure drop in the magnet flow circuit, eliminates most two phase flow oscillations, and it permits the magnets to operate at variable thermal loads using the liquid in the storage dewar as a buffer. The g- 2 magnet cooling system will consist of three parallel two-phase helium flow circuits that provide cooling to the following components: (1) the four large superconducting solenoids, (2) the current interconnects between the solenoids and the <b>solenoid</b> <b>gas</b> cooled electrical leads, and (3) the inflector dipole and its gas cooled electrical leads. This report describes a cryogenic test of the two 15. 1 meter diameter superconducting solenoids using two-phase helium from a dewar.

40|$|There are {{numerous}} materials science experiments in microgravity, {{which can be}} realized on sounding rockets, e. g. the gelation of aerogels, directional solidification of alloys and diffusion measurements in metallic melts. Such a rocket must offer a period of good microgravity-conditions for more than 120 s. The MAPHEUS (Materialphysikalische Experimente unter Schwerelosigkeit) rocket of the German Aerospace Center DLR meets these requirements. The payload is based on modules with 356 mm diameter, which are also used in the REXUS project. MAPHEUS implements the newly developed REXUS service-system. This service-system can control the power supply and handles data communication and time event management of the scientific experiments. An RCS-Module (Rate-Control- System) has been designed and built. This module contains a tank filled with pressurized <b>gas</b> (nitrogen), <b>solenoid</b> valves and nozzles, which are used to reduce the spin during the ballistic flight phase to less than 30 °/min providing excellent microgravity conditions. During the maiden flight, in May 2009 at Esrange, Sweden, the payload was transported with a double stage solid propellant rocket up to an apogee of about 140 km. The first stage, a Nike motor, burned for 3. 5 s and then, 9 s after lift-off, the second stage, an Improved Orion motor, ignited. At an altitude of about 70 km a yo-yo system decreased {{the rotation of the}} vehicle about its’ longitudinal axis, which was spin-stabilized during the ascent. After the second stage was separated and the rotation rates were reduced by the RCS, the experiment phase began at an altitude above 100 km. The scientific payload of MAPHEUS- 1 consisted of three DLR internal experiment modules and a battery module from the DLR Institute of Materials Physics in Space, a measurement platform from the University of Applied Science Aachen, and the RB-MUSC from DLR Köln. The three material science experiments launched were AEROGET, an experiment to create frequency doubling aerogels, ATLAS-M, an experiment for diffusion measurements in molten metals and ARTEX-M, an experiment for directional solidification of AlSi-alloys. After the experiment phase, the payload re-enters the atmosphere and was decelerated by the aerodynamic drag. At an altitude of about 4. 6 km the parachute system was released and the payload thus decelerated to a terminal velocity of 8 m/s. The DLR Institute of Space System was responsible for the project management and the DLR Mobile Rocket Base provided the rocket hardware and conducted the operations during campaign. This paper gives an overview of the MAPHEUS- 1 vehicle, the experiments, the successful maiden flight of the rate-control-system and the campaign. It also includes flight results and gives an outlook on the MAPHEUS programme...|$|R
