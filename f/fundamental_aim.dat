25|$|The <b>fundamental</b> <b>aim</b> of each batsman {{is to find}} a {{means of}} safely scoring runs against each bowler he faces. To do this, the batsman must take into {{consideration}} the bowler's strategy, the position of the fielders, the pitch conditions, and his own strengths and weaknesses. The strategy he will decide on will incorporate a number of preconceived attacking responses to the various deliveries he may anticipate receiving, designed specifically to score runs with minimal risk of being dismissed. The success of this strategy will be dependent upon both the accuracy of its conception and the technical ability with which it is carried out. The level of aggression of his strategy will be informed by the target run rate and the calculated risk of losing his wicket, which will be dependent upon the match situation. As such, strategies vary between the three forms of international cricket, T20, Test cricket and One Day International cricket.|$|E
