[...] "He makes a run from the halfway line on the left hand side. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>it</b> and I showed our players it", said McCoist, adding that [...] "he [...] just has a desire to run and run and just get {{on the end of}} a cross. You can't buy that, you can't teach that".|$|E
500|$|Hathaway {{believes}} that Blunt's career took {{off because of}} her role. [...] "I've never witnessed a star being born before," [...] Hathaway says. [...] "That's the first time <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>it</b> happen." [...] Blunt agrees that it was [...] "a night and day change" [...] for her—the day after the film was released, she told Variety, {{the staff at the}} coffee shop she had been going to for breakfast every morning in Los Angeles suddenly recognized her. Even ten years later, people still quote her lines from the film back to her at least once a week, she says.|$|E
500|$|In August 2009, country {{pop singer}} Taylor Swift used Bieber's [...] "One Time" [...] as {{background}} music and music {{that she and}} her friends were dancing to in a tour video diary that she posted on her official YouTube account. In response to Swift using his song, Bieber posted an acoustic rendition of the then never-before heard [...] "Favorite Girl" [...] on his YouTube. When asked about his learning of Swift using his song, Bieber stated, [...] "It was really funny because I heard about it from a fan. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>it</b> and it was hilarious!" [...] Bieber and Swift then met in person at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, and she later invited him to be a special guest on her Fearless Tour when she returned to the United Kingdom.|$|E

500|$|Chicago Sun-Times {{film critic}} Roger Ebert gave the film the rating {{of half a}} star out of four, and {{compared}} his screening to [...] "taking a bus trip with someone who has needed a bath for a long time. It's not merely bad; it's unpleasant in a hostile way ... <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>it</b> in mounting gloom, realizing I was witnessing something historic, a film that {{for decades to come}} will be the punch line of jokes about bad movies." [...] Leonard Maltin rated the film a [...] "BOMB" [...] in his book Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide, writing: [...] "Clumsy plot, misplaced satire, unbelievable coincidences, and a leaden pace trample Travolta's weird but amusing performance." [...] David Bleiler gave the film one star out of four in the TLA Video & DVD Guide, writing: [...] "This is disjointed, tedious, and every bit as bad as its reputation." [...] Jon Stewart mocked the film on his television program The Daily Show, describing it as [...] "a cross between Star Wars and the smell of ass." ...|$|E
500|$|Writers for Variety, the Hollywood Reporter and Sight & Sound all {{emphasized}} the film's final scene. Scheck (Hollywood Reporter) wrote that [...] "Miike lulls the audience {{into a state}} of complacency with a studied, slow-moving, lightly comic first half before delivering a gruesome final section that makes Stephen King's Misery look wholesome"; the ending was [...] "all the more shocking for the clinical way in which it is presented". Eisner (Variety) stated that it is only at the ending of the film that Audition [...] "breaks out of creepfest ghetto". [...] In his essay on themes in Audition, Robin Wood stated that most of Miike's films are disturbing for [...] "what they have to tell us about the state of contemporary civilization; they are not in the least disturbing in themselves, operating on some fantasy level of annihilation, with 'comic-book' violence". In comparison, he stated that Audition is [...] "authentically disturbing, and infinitely more horrifying: the first time <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>it</b> – on DVD, at home, after warnings I had received – I was repeatedly tempted, through the last half hour, to turn it off". Wood compared the film to Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom, stating that the film was [...] "almost as unwatchable as the news reels – of Auschwitz, of the innocent victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Vietnam, victims of Nazi or American dehumanization".|$|E
2500|$|Velasquez credits Barbara Streisand, Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston as her major {{influences}} {{in her early}} years. Velasquez idolizes Whitney Houston for her style because of her R influence. When she first heard Mariah Carey sing, she was blown away, and {{liked the fact that}} Carey can write her own songs. However, Barbara Streisand who directs and stars in her own movies, has influenced Velasquez the most. Velasquez said the first time she saw Streisand perform was on TV in one of her musical specials, she told The Philippine Star, [...] "I can still remember that time. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>it</b> from our neighbour's TV set, because we didn't have one then." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wall {{said the}} car crash stunt was her {{favourite}} storyline from Grace's tenure. She told Hooper (Closer) that [...] "it was literally {{the most fun}} I’ve had whilst I’ve been here. It’s Grace at her absolute maddest. When <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>it</b> back and saw my facial expressions, I couldn’t have looked any uglier if I tried! It’s nice being outside on location and doing things that {{are a little bit}} different." [...] She also believed that the crash and Dylan's subsequent death was [...] "kind of Grace's fault". The crash was named one of [...] "the best bits of August" [...] in the Inside Soap Yearbook 2016.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} in this cottage that the first dawnings of the Jungle Books came to Kipling: [...] " [...] [...] {{workroom}} in the Bliss Cottage was seven feet by eight, and from December to April, the snow lay level with its window-sill. It chanced that I had written a tale about Indian Forestry work which included a boy who had been brought up by wolves. In the stillness, and suspense, of the winter of ’92 some memory of the Masonic Lions of my childhood's magazine, and a phrase in Haggard's Nada the Lily, combined with the echo of this tale. After blocking out the main idea in my head, the pen took charge, and <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>it</b> begin to write stories about Mowgli and animals, which later grew into the two Jungle Books [...] ". With Josephine's arrival, Bliss Cottage was felt to be congested, so eventually the couple bought land — [...] on a rocky hillside overlooking the Connecticut River — from Carrie's brother Beatty Balestier and built their own house.|$|E

But every time <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>it</b> again, it's such a terrible thing. Perhaps people notice that there's a certain high craft about these pics, as they were literally made out of nothing." ...|$|R
