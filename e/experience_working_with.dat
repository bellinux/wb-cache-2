5|$|Special effects company Amalgamated Dynamics Incorporated (ADI) {{was hired}} for the film, having {{previously}} worked on Alien 3. ADI founders Tom Woodruff, Jr. and Alec Gillis also had <b>experience</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> Stan Winston on Aliens. ADI based their designs and modifications of the Alien creatures on the film's script, {{which included the}} creatures having pointed tails for swimming, making their head domes and chins more pointed, and establishing them to appear more vicious using techniques of camera angles and shot duration. After receiving the director's approval, ADI began to create small sculptures, sketches, paintings, and life-size models.|$|E

5|$|In 1970 Zappa met {{conductor}} Zubin Mehta. They {{arranged a}} May 1970 concert where Mehta conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic augmented by a rock band. According to Zappa, {{the music was}} mostly written in motel rooms while on tour with the Mothers of Invention. Some of it was later featured in the movie 200 Motels. Although the concert was a success, Zappa's <b>experience</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> a symphony orchestra was not a happy one. His dissatisfaction became a recurring theme throughout his career; he often felt {{that the quality of}} performance of his material delivered by orchestras was not commensurate with the money he spent on orchestral concerts and recordings.|$|E
5|$|The five {{previous}} {{series of}} One Foot in the Grave were produced {{and directed by}} Susan Belbin. She had retired because of ill health. Renwick persuaded her {{to return to work}} on the final series to provide continuity, but her health quickly forced her to resign from the show again. The final series was produced by Jonathon P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's <b>experience</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> Belbin on the earlier series of One Foot as a production secretary and assistant, as well as on other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, which would aid the transition between directors.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated at {{not being}} able to fight the enemy directly, Clark volunteered for service with the Special Operations Executive (SOE), an {{irregular}} warfare unit, in June 1943, having claimed to have had <b>experience</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> small boats. He undertook commando training at Arisaig in the Scottish Highlands and further SOE training at Helford in Cornwall. After completing his training, Clark was dispatched to Algeria in September 1943 and thence to Monopoli in south-east Italy in December. He was attached to the SOE's No 1 Special Force and undertook amphibious sabotage, reconnaissance operations and running of agents into enemy-held beaches by canoe. His wireless operator for these missions was Marjorie Lewis, his future wife, who had joined the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY; often used as a cover for women who joined SOE) in 1943. On 1 March 1944 Clark, who had previously only held the acting rank of sub-lieutenant, was confirmed in a substantive (though temporary) rank.|$|E

5|$|Wolf named Tom Bass {{director}} of player personnel. Bass had previously served {{as head of}} scouting and defensive coordinator for the Cincinnati Bengals, the only team apart from the Buccaneers and Raiders that still maintained a human scouting staff instead of using the computerized services, and the team on whose model the Buccaneers’ expansion strategy was patterned. Bass was Paul Brown’s first coaching hire with the expansion Bengals, and previously had been an assistant under Sid Gillman with the San Diego Chargers, and with Don Coryell at San Diego State. Former McKay assistant and Utah State head coach Phil Krueger {{was added to the}} staff, joined shortly thereafter by USC assistants Wayne Fontes and Willie Brown, as defensive backs and receivers coaches, respectively. Dennis Fryzel, the last University of Tampa head coach, was added to handle special teams. Denver Broncos assistant Jerry Frei was hired as offensive line coach, becoming McKay’s first assistant hired from the professional ranks, and was followed by former New York Jets defensive coordinator Dick Voris, hired initially as defensive line coach. Abe Gibron, former head coach of the Chicago Bears and college teammate of McKay at Purdue, was brought on board as a defensive assistant. The staff was completed with the addition of Atlanta Falcons assistant and former Oakland Raiders and Buffalo Bills head coach John Rauch as offensive coordinator. Tampa resident Harry Smith, a trainer with <b>experience</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> local college athletes such as John Matuszak and Gary Huff, became the team’s strength and conditioning coach.|$|E

Before construction could begin, the area had to be checked by the French authorities for ordnance and other materiel left from the war. This was done in April 2009, and though no unexploded munitions were found, other wartime debris was cleared from the area, including barbed wire and shell cases. Construction proper began in May 2009, with the site being levelled in preparation for the laying of the foundations, while temporary hoardings were put up to enclose the site.|$|E
25|$|After {{arriving}} in Peking, Phillips was immersed in Chinese lessons.

Phillips stayed in Peking for six months to gain <b>experience,</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> Dr. Aspland as well as visiting multiple other mission hospitals in the area. During her time in Peking, Phillips developed an acute case of Tuberculosis and was advised by Dr. Aspland to leave Peking and go to the country for fresh air. Over the six weeks spent at the mission rest-house, Phillips idealistic view of mission work became slightly tarnished by the lack of friendliness displayed by her coworkers in Peking.|$|E

The setting {{is similar to that of}} Die Hard and both their Chinese film titles. This movie is notable in that director Wong Jing had such a terrible <b>experience</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> Jackie Chan in Jing's previous film City Hunter that he chose to make Cheung's character a biting satire of Chan.

25|$|Williams was {{promoted}} to brigadier general on 18 March 1943. After four hectic months with the XII Air Support Command, Williams returned to troops carriers as commander of the Northwest African Air Force Troop Carrier Command (Provisional). This had been created on 21 March 1943 to handle the airborne phase of Operation HUSKY, the Allied invasion of Sicily. In addition to the 51st Troop Carrier Wing, the Troop Carrier Command included the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing and No. 38 Wing, RAF. Getting this force ready for action was a major challenge. The 51st was assigned {{to work with the}} British and the 52nd with the Americans because the 51st had prior <b>experience</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> the British in North Africa, and its aircraft had been modified to work with British troops. However the British plan called for a glider infantry mission and the 51st had no experience with gliders, whereas the 52nd had conducted training with gliders before leaving the United States, but was committed to a parachute mission. Gliders were delivered disassembled and a major effort was required to assemble the required number of gliders. In the meantime, valuable training time was lost.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{there have}} been three major {{policies}} addressing special education in the United States. These policies were the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1997, and the No Child Left Behind in 2001. The development of these policies showed increased guidelines for special education and requirements; such as requiring states to fund special education, equality of opportunities, help with transitions after secondary schooling, requiring extra qualifications for special education teachers, and creating a more specific class setting for those with disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, specifically had a large impact on special education as public schools were then required to employ high qualified staff. For one to be a Certified Autism Specialist, one must have a master's degree, two years of career <b>experience</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> the autism population, earn 14 continuing education hours in autism every two years, and register with the International Institute of Education. In 1993, Mexico passed an education law that called for the inclusion of those with disabilities. This law was very important for Mexico education, however, {{there have been}} issues in implementing it {{due to a lack of}} resources.|$|E
