5|$|The <b>koala</b> is {{featured}} in the Dreamtime stories and mythology of indigenous Australians. The Tharawal people believed that the animal helped row the boat that {{brought them to the}} continent. Another myth tells of how a tribe killed a <b>koala</b> and used its long intestines to create a bridge for people {{from other parts of the}} world. This narrative highlights the koala's status as a game animal and the length of its intestines. Several stories tell of how the <b>koala</b> lost its tail. In one, a kangaroo cuts it off to punish the <b>koala</b> for being lazy and greedy. Tribes in both Queensland and Victoria regarded the <b>koala</b> as a wise animal and sought its advice. Bidjara-speaking people credited the <b>koala</b> for turning barren lands into lush forests. The animal is also depicted in rock carvings, though not as much as some other species.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, three {{distinct}} subspecies have been recognised: the Queensland <b>koala</b> (P.c. adustus, Thomas 1923), the New South Wales <b>koala</b> (P.c.cinereus, Goldfuss 1817), and the Victorian <b>koala</b> (P.c.victor, Troughton 1935). These forms are distinguished by pelage colour and thickness, body size, and skull shape. The Queensland <b>koala</b> {{is the smallest}} of the three, with shorter, silver fur and a shorter skull. The Victorian <b>koala</b> is the largest, with shaggier, brown fur and a wider skull. The boundaries of these variations are based on state borders, and their status as subspecies is disputed. A 1999 genetic study suggests that the variations represent differentiated populations with limited gene flow between them, and that the three subspecies comprise a single evolutionarily significant unit. Other studies have found that <b>koala</b> populations have high levels of inbreeding and low genetic variation. Such low genetic diversity may have been a characteristic of <b>koala</b> populations since the late Pleistocene. Rivers and roads have been shown to limit gene flow and contribute to the genetic differentiation of southeast Queensland populations. In April 2013, scientists from the Australian Museum and Queensland University of Technology announced they had fully sequenced the <b>koala</b> genome.|$|E
5|$|While the <b>koala</b> was {{previously}} classified as Least Concern on the Red List, it was uplisted to Vulnerable in 2016. Australian policy makers declined a 2009 proposal {{to include the}} <b>koala</b> in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. In 2012, the Australian government listed <b>koala</b> populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable, because of a 40% population decline in the former and a 33% decline in the latter. Populations in Victoria and South Australia appear to be abundant; however, the Australian <b>Koala</b> Foundation argues that the exclusion of Victorian populations from protective measures {{is based on a}} misconception that the total <b>koala</b> population is 200,000, whereas they believe it is probably less than 100,000.|$|E
40|$|North Stradbroke Island lies 4 km off {{the coast}} of Queensland, Australia. It is home to one of the only {{naturally}} occurring island populations of <b>koalas</b> and it is mined for mineral sands. We analysed the diet and day use tree selections of <b>koalas</b> and recorded the tree species composition of revegetated and undisturbed landscapes at this location. We used faecal cuticle examination to compare the diet of <b>koalas</b> that used reconstructed landscapes with that of <b>koalas</b> that used undisturbed areas. Reconstructed landscapes that were composed of more than 95 % diet and/or roost tree species had evidence of use by <b>koalas.</b> Eucalyptus robusta was the most commonly eaten and utilised species and {{there was no difference in}} general diet composition between <b>koalas</b> that used the revegetated landscape and those inhabiting undisturbed areas. Other species that were used for roosting and forage included E. racemosa, E. pilularis, Lophostemon confertus and Melaleuca quinquinerva. We observed individual differences and seasonal variation in the diet composition of radio-tracked <b>koalas.</b> These results suggest either flexibility in the diet choices of <b>koalas,</b> or individual preferences within groups of <b>koalas.</b> Our results also indicate that post-mining landscapes can provide habitat that will be used by <b>koalas,</b> which should encourage further efforts into habitat re-creation for native species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: As part of {{a health}} {{investigation}} on <b>koalas</b> at San Diego Zoo, serum samples were analyzed from 18 free-ranging and 22 zoo-based <b>koalas,</b> Phascolarctos cinereus. Serum concentrations of calcium, chloride, cobalt, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, sodium, zinc, and vitamins A, E, and 25 (OH) D 3 were quantified. Calcium, chloride, molybdenum, selenium, and vitamin E concentrations were significantly higher in zoo-based <b>koalas</b> than in free-ranging <b>koalas,</b> whereas magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and zinc concentrations were significantly higher in the free-ranging <b>koalas.</b> No {{significant differences were found}} between genders. The results from this study will help to establish a starting point for determining target circulating nutrient concentrations in <b>koalas...</b>|$|R
40|$|We studied {{two groups}} of <b>koalas</b> during a drought in central Queensland to {{investigate}} potential impacts of climatic variability on the physiology and behaviour of this species. The tree use, water turnover, field metabolic rate and diet of <b>koalas</b> during autumn and spring were compared to a similar study of <b>koalas</b> in summer and winter, also in central Queensland, to generate a seasonal picture of the response of <b>koalas</b> to climatic variation. We also compared the microclimate temperature {{of a range of}} food and non-food tree species against daily ambient temperatures, to examine the benefit to <b>koalas</b> of using of non-food species. Field metabolic rate, adjusted for body mass, was significantly higher in spring than autumn and {{there was no difference between}} males and females. Neither females with pouch young nor those with back young had significantly different FMR to that of females without young, confirming that <b>koalas</b> may compartmentalize energy demands during lactation. Estimations of theoretical water Influx, determined from FMR of <b>koalas,</b> were generally lower than water flux determined by tritiated water turnover. This mismatch could indicate that <b>koalas</b> are able to modify their assimilation of energy from browse in order to maximize water intake. Temperature was generally lower in non-food trees used by <b>koalas</b> in daytime than in the food trees, which were generally used at night. Leaf moisture may influence tree selection during periods of extremely high or low temperature, but the physical attributes of trees, such as their capacity to "buffer" <b>koalas</b> against extremes of ambient temperature, appear to be important to selection by <b>koalas.</b> We conclude that <b>koalas</b> adapt their behaviour, using shady trees during the day, but might also employ physiological adaptations, to access sufficient water for evaporative cooling during periods of hot, dry weather...|$|R
5|$|Koalas can {{be subject}} to {{pathogens}} such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria, which can cause keratoconjunctivitis, urinary tract infection, and reproductive tract infection. Such infections are widespread on the mainland, but absent in some island populations. The <b>koala</b> retrovirus (KoRV) may cause <b>koala</b> immune deficiency syndrome (KIDS) {{which is similar to}} AIDS in humans. Prevalence of KoRV in <b>koala</b> populations suggests a trend spreading from the north to the south of Australia. Northern populations are completely infected, while some southern populations (including Kangaroo Island) are free.|$|E
5|$|From the 1970s to the 1990s, {{there have}} been {{suggestions}} that the ruffed lemurs {{might be related to}} indriids or a sister group to Lemuridae and Indriidae and that the bamboo lemurs are related to the sportive lemurs, but neither view is supported by molecular phylogeny. The sportive lemurs and the extinct <b>koala</b> lemurs (Megaladapidae) both lack upper incisors in the permanent dentition, and in 1981, Groves placed both together in the family Megaladapidae, which he renamed Lepilemuridae in 2005 because that older name takes precedence. Genetic research does not support a close relationship between the sportive and <b>koala</b> lemurs and instead places the <b>koala</b> lemurs as a sister group to Lemuridae; therefore, the two are now placed in separate families (Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and Megaladapidae for the <b>koala</b> lemurs). The sloth lemurs (Palaeopropithecidae) and monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae) were classified as subfamilies within Indriidae as late as 1982, but are now recognized as separate families.|$|E
5|$|<b>Koala</b> Territory {{was first}} opened in 2005, and houses three koalas, two males named Gooanroo and Yabbra, {{and a female}} named Alinga. Yooranah was the {{offspring}} of Alinga and Goonaroo, and was born in 2013 and died in 2016. <b>Koala</b> Territory is decorated with Aboriginal-inspired artwork, and features a garden of eucalyptus plants.|$|E
40|$|Studies on the {{reproductive}} endocrinology of <b>koalas</b> {{have been performed}} mainly by using blood samples; however, in practice {{it is difficult to}} collect blood periodically because <b>koalas</b> are easily stressed. The purposes of the present study were to establish a noninvasive endocrine monitoring technique and to investigate {{the reproductive}} physiology of female <b>koalas.</b> Feces were collected from female northern and southern <b>koalas,</b> and progestagen was extracted from lyophilized fecal samples and determined by enzyme immunoassay. In nonpregnant northern and southern <b>koalas,</b> fecal progestagen markedly increased after copulation and remained high for 36. 3 6 2. 5 days and 38. 9 6 1. 4 days (luteal phase, mean 6 SEM), respectively. Mean (6 SEM) progestagen levels (6. 34 6 0. 49 lg/g) during the luteal phase in northern <b>koalas</b> were signifi...|$|R
5|$|<b>Koalas</b> {{may live}} from 13 to 18 {{years in the}} wild. While female <b>koalas</b> usually live this long, males may die sooner because of their more {{hazardous}} lives. <b>Koalas</b> usually survive falls from trees and immediately climb back up, but injuries and deaths from falls do occur, particularly in inexperienced young and fighting males. Around six years of age, the <b>koala's</b> chewing teeth begin to wear down and their chewing efficiency decreases. Eventually, the cusps disappear completely and the animal will die of starvation.|$|R
40|$|Mass-corrected field {{metabolic}} {{rates of}} free-ranging male <b>koalas</b> in central Queensland, Australia, varied between 0. 329 MJ kg 0. 75 day- 1 {{in summer and}} 0. 382 MJ kg 0. 75 day- 1 in winter. Field water influx measured 50. 8 mL kg- 0. 8 day- 1 in winter, increasing to 59. 9 mL kg 0. 8 day- 1 in summer for the same <b>koalas,</b> and {{was positively correlated with}} values for leaf moisture of food. Winter rates of water influx for <b>koalas</b> from Springsure were lower than those recorded for <b>koalas</b> from Victoria for the same period of the year. Mass-corrected feeding rates were lower in summer than winter; wet food intake was significantly lower than reported for similar sized female <b>koalas</b> from Victoria. The preferred browse was Eucalyptus crebra in winter and E. tereticornis in summer. Our study indicates that in central Queensland seasonal changes in diet selection by male <b>koalas</b> reflect increased energy requirements in winter and increased water requirements in summer...|$|R
5|$|Naturalist {{and popular}} artist John Gould {{illustrated}} {{and described the}} <b>koala</b> in his three-volume work The Mammals of Australia (1845–63) and introduced the species, {{as well as other}} members of Australia's little-known faunal community, to the general British public. Comparative anatomist Richard Owen, in a series of publications on the physiology and anatomy of Australian mammals, presented a paper on the anatomy of the <b>koala</b> to the Zoological Society of London. In this widely cited publication, he provided the first careful description of its internal anatomy, and noted its general structural similarity to the wombat. English naturalist George Robert Waterhouse, curator of the Zoological Society of London, was the first to correctly classify the <b>koala</b> as a marsupial in the 1840s. He identified similarities between it and its fossil relatives Diprotodon and Nototherium, which had been discovered just a few years before. Similarly, Gerard Krefft, curator of the Australian Museum in Sydney, noted evolutionary mechanisms at work when comparing the <b>koala</b> to its ancestral relatives in his 1871 The Mammals of Australia.|$|E
5|$|The first living <b>koala</b> in Britain {{arrived in}} 1881, {{purchased}} by the Zoological Society of London. As related by prosecutor to the society, William Alexander Forbes, the animal suffered an accidental demise when the heavy lid of a washstand fell on {{it and it was}} unable to free itself. Forbes used the opportunity to dissect the fresh female specimen, thus was able to provide explicit anatomical details on the female reproductive system, the brain, and the liver—parts not previously described by Owen, who had access only to preserved specimens. Scottish embryologist William Caldwell—well known in scientific circles for determining the reproductive mechanism of the platypus—described the uterine development of the <b>koala</b> in 1884, and used the new information to convincingly place the <b>koala</b> and the monotremes into an evolutionary time frame.|$|E
5|$|The first {{successful}} efforts at conserving the species were {{initiated by the}} establishment of Brisbane's Lone Pine <b>Koala</b> Sanctuary and Sydney's <b>Koala</b> Park Sanctuary in the 1920s and 1930s. The owner of the latter park, Noel Burnet, became the first to successfully breed koalas and {{earned a reputation as}} the foremost contemporary authority on the marsupial. In 1934, David Fleay, curator of Australian mammals at the Melbourne Zoo, established the first Australian faunal enclosure at an Australian zoo, and featured the <b>koala.</b> This arrangement allowed him to undertake a detailed study of its diet in captivity. Fleay later continued his conservation efforts at Healesville Sanctuary and the David Fleay Wildlife Park.|$|E
40|$|Studies characterising {{the thyroid}} gland {{structure}} of <b>koalas</b> are limited {{and have not}} previously been undertaken in South Australian populations. Hence, this study aimed to describe the thyroid gland morphology of <b>koalas</b> from the Mount Lofty region, South Australia. Results showed that thyroid gland morphology was highly variable between individual <b>koalas</b> (n = 36), ranging from that considered typical for healthy mammals, in which small colloid-filled follicles were lined by cuboidal epithelium, to that consistent with colloidal goitre, in which macrofollicles distended with colloid were lined by flattened epithelium. Juvenile <b>koalas</b> more frequently showed typical thyroid gland morphology than adults, with significantly higher thyroid follicle density (P < 0. 05) and {{a higher proportion of}} follicles lined by cuboidal epithelium compared with flattened epithelium (P < 0. 05). Thyroid glands of most adult <b>koalas</b> were characterised by colloidal macrofollicles (P < 0. 01), and classified as colloidal goitre. There {{were no significant differences in}} thyroid gland morphology based on health status or sex of <b>koalas.</b> These findings suggest that an age-dependent colloidal goitre occurs in adult <b>koalas,</b> which is unlikely to have ill effects and may be associated with the low metabolic rate of this species, or exposure to a dietary goitrogen.

50|$|Four <b>koalas</b> and two {{kangaroos}} {{were flown}} from Australia {{to appear in}} the film. The <b>koalas</b> were the first to be exported from Australia in 25 years and were later transferred to San Diego Zoo.|$|R
50|$|The {{park was}} opened in 1989, {{and was a}} major {{breeding}} centre for <b>koalas.</b> Starting in 2005, new ownership of the park has seen it move from simply breeding <b>koalas</b> to a more common wildlife park.|$|R
5|$|Botanist Robert Brown was {{the first}} to write a {{detailed}} scientific description of the <b>koala</b> in 1814, based on a female specimen captured near what is now Mount Kembla in the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Austrian botanical illustrator Ferdinand Bauer drew the animal's skull, throat, feet, and paws. Brown's work remained unpublished and largely unnoticed, however, as his field books and notes remained in his possession until his death, when they were bequeathed to the British Museum (Natural History) in London. They were not identified until 1994, while Bauer's <b>koala</b> watercolours were not published until 1989. British surgeon Everard Home included details of the <b>koala</b> based on eyewitness accounts of William Paterson, who had befriended Brown and Bauer during their stay in New South Wales. Home, who in 1808 published his report in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, gave the animal the scientific name Didelphis coola.|$|E
5|$|Koalas were hunted by {{indigenous}} Australians and {{depicted in}} myths and cave art for millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European and a <b>koala</b> was in 1798, and {{an image of}} the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist George Perry. Botanist Robert Brown wrote the first detailed scientific description of the <b>koala</b> in 1814, although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Popular artist John Gould illustrated and described the <b>koala,</b> introducing the species to the general British public. Further details about the animal's biology were revealed in the 19th century by several English scientists. Because of its distinctive appearance, the <b>koala</b> is recognised worldwide as a symbol of Australia. Koalas are listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The Australian government similarly lists specific populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable. The animal was hunted heavily in the early 20th century for its fur, and large-scale cullings in Queensland resulted in a public outcry that initiated a movement to protect the species. Sanctuaries were established, and translocation efforts moved to new regions koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced. The biggest threat to their existence is habitat destruction caused by agriculture and urbanisation.|$|E
5|$|The boss {{characters}} of the game include Papu Papu, an obese and short-tempered chief of the native village; Ripper Roo, a demented kangaroo with razor-sharp toenails; <b>Koala</b> Kong, a muscular but unintelligent koala; and Pinstripe Potoroo, Doctor Cortex's tommy gun-wielding bodyguard.|$|E
50|$|Although {{its use in}} {{veterinary}} medicine is highly restricted, chloramphenicol still has some important veterinary uses. It is currently considered the most useful treatment of chlamydial disease in <b>koalas.</b> The pharmacokinetics of chloramphenicol have been investigated in <b>koalas.</b>|$|R
25|$|In March 2008, the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital {{was accused}} of animal 'cruelty' and of {{breaking}} Australian law 13 times by not releasing rehabilitated <b>koalas</b> within their prescribed habitats. The Environment Protection Association said {{that they are now}} monitoring and investigating why the <b>koalas</b> were not released correctly. Hospital officials have defended their actions on the grounds that injured <b>koalas</b> found near busy roads or in urban developments cannot safely be released to the same areas.|$|R
50|$|Sporobolomyces <b>koalae</b> is {{a species}} of fungus in the order Sporidiobolales. It is an {{anamorphic}} yeast. Strains of the yeast were isolated from nasal swabs from three of five captive Queensland <b>koalas</b> (Phascolarctos cinereus) kept at the Kobe Oji Zoo in Kobe, Japan. Swabs from three zoo keepers were examined as well, but tested negative {{for the presence of}} the yeast. It is not suspected to be pathogenic, as the <b>koalas</b> from which it was isolated were healthy.|$|R
5|$|The modern <b>koala</b> is {{the only}} extant member of Phascolarctidae, a family that once {{included}} several genera and species. During the Oligocene and Miocene, koalas lived in rainforests and had less specialised diets. Some species, such as the Riversleigh rainforest <b>koala</b> (Nimiokoala greystanesi) and some species of Perikoala, were around {{the same size as}} the modern <b>koala,</b> while others, such as species of Litokoala, were one-half to two-thirds its size. Like the modern species, prehistoric koalas had well developed ear structures which suggests that long-distance vocalising and sedentism developed early. During the Miocene, the Australian continent began drying out, leading to the decline of rainforests and the spread of open Eucalyptus woodlands. The genus Phascolarctos split from Litokoala in the late Miocene and had several adaptations that allowed it to live on a specialised eucalyptus diet: a shifting of the palate towards the front of the skull; larger molars and premolars; smaller pterygoid fossa; and a larger gap between the molar and the incisor teeth.|$|E
5|$|The <b>koala</b> {{has several}} adaptations for its {{eucalypt}} diet, {{which is of}} low nutritive value, of high toxicity, and high in dietary fibre. The animal's dentition consists of the incisors and cheek teeth (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw), which are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals). The incisors are used for grasping leaves, which are then passed to the premolars to be snipped at the petiole before being passed to the highly cusped molars, where they are shredded into small pieces. Koalas may also store food in their cheek pouches before it {{is ready to be}} chewed. The partially worn molars of middle-aged koalas are optimal for breaking the leaves into small particles, resulting in more efficient stomach digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine, which digests the eucalyptus leaves to provide most of the animal's energy. A <b>koala</b> sometimes regurgitates the food into the mouth to be chewed a second time.|$|E
5|$|The drop bear is an {{imaginary}} creature in contemporary Australian folklore featuring a predatory, carnivorous {{version of the}} <b>koala.</b> This hoax animal is commonly spoken about in tall tales designed to scare tourists. While koalas are typically docile herbivores, drop bears are described as unusually large and vicious marsupials that inhabit treetops and attack unsuspecting people (or other prey) that walk beneath them by dropping onto their heads from above.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} {{the first report}} of Trypanosoma vegrandis in <b>koalas</b> using morphology and sequence analysis of the 18 S rRNA gene. The prevalence of T. vegrandis in <b>koalas</b> was 13. 6 % (6 / 44). It {{is likely that the}} small size of T. vegrandis (< 10 μm in length), coupled with the difficulties in amplifying DNA of this parasite in mixed infections using trypanosome generic primers, are the reason why this organism has not been identified in <b>koalas</b> until now. This study highlights the importance of further research comprising a larger sample size to determine the prevalence of T. vegrandis in <b>koalas</b> as well as its potential impacts upon this marsupial species' health...|$|R
40|$|Infection by Chlamydia pneumoniae or Chlamydia pecorum {{commonly}} causes chronic, fibrotic {{disease of}} the urogenital tracts of female <b>koalas.</b> Studies of humans have associated titers of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) against chlamydial hsp 60 and hsp 10 antigens with chronic infection, salpingeal fibrosis, and tubal infertility. To determine whether a similar relationship exists in Chlamydia-infected <b>koalas,</b> samples were collected opportunistically from 34 wild female <b>koalas</b> and examined by gross pathology and histopathology, PCR, and immunohistochemistry for Chlamydia spp. and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serological responses to chlamydial hsp 10 and hsp 60 antigens. Greater anti-hsp titers occurred in Chlamydia-infected <b>koalas</b> with fibrous occlusion of the uterus or uterine tube than in other Chlamydia-infected <b>koalas</b> (for hsp 10 IgG, P = 0. 005; for hsp 60 IgG, P = 0. 001; for hsp 10 IgA, P = 0. 04; for hsp 60 IgA, P = 0. 09). However, as in humans, some <b>koalas</b> with tubal occlusion had low titers. Among Chlamydia-infected <b>koalas</b> with tubal occlusion, those with low titers {{were more likely to}} have an active component to their ongoing uterine or salpingeal inflammation (P = 0. 007), such that the assay predicted, with 79 % sensitivity and 92 % specificity, tubal occlusion where an active component of inflammation was absent. Findings of this study permit advancement of clinical and epidemiological studies of host-pathogen-environment interactions and pose intriguing questions regarding the significance of the Th 1 /Th 2 paradigm and antigen-presenting and inflammation-regulating capabilities of uterine epithelial cells and the roles of latency and reactivation of chlamydial infections in pathogenesis of upper reproductive tract disease of <b>koalas...</b>|$|R
25|$|An {{essential}} oil extracted from eucalyptus leaves contains compounds that are powerful natural disinfectants {{and can be}} toxic in large quantities. Several marsupial herbivores, notably <b>koalas</b> and some possums, are relatively tolerant of it. The close correlation of these oils with other more potent toxins called formylated phloroglucinol compounds (euglobals, macrocarpals and sideroxylonals) allows <b>koalas</b> and other marsupial species to make food choices based on {{the smell of the}} leaves. For <b>koalas,</b> these compounds are {{the most important factor in}} leaf choice.|$|R
5|$|The <b>koala</b> is {{classified}} with wombats (family Vombatidae) and several extinct families (including marsupial tapirs, marsupial lions and giant wombats) in the suborder Vombatiformes within the order Diprotodontia. The Vombatiformes are a sister group to a clade that includes macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) and possums. The ancestors of vombatiforms were likely arboreal, and the koala's lineage was possibly {{the first to}} branch off around 40 million years ago during the Eocene.|$|E
5|$|The koala's {{geographic}} range covers roughly , and 30 ecoregions. It extends throughout eastern and southeastern Australia, encompassing northeastern, central and southeastern Queensland, eastern New South Wales, Victoria, and southeastern South Australia. The <b>koala</b> was introduced near Adelaide and on several islands, including Kangaroo Island and French Island. The population on Magnetic Island represents the northern limit of its range. Fossil {{evidence shows that}} the koala's range stretched as far west as southwestern Western Australia during the late Pleistocene. They were likely driven to extinction in these areas by environmental changes and hunting by indigenous Australians.|$|E
5|$|Relationships among lemur {{families}} have also {{proven to be}} problematic and {{have yet to be}} definitively resolved. To further complicate the issue, several Paleogene fossil primates from outside Madagascar, such as Bugtilemur, have been classified as lemurs. However, scientific consensus does not accept these assignments based on genetic evidence, and therefore it is generally accepted that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic. Another area of contention is the relationship between the sportive lemurs and the extinct <b>koala</b> lemurs (Megaladapidae). Formerly grouped in the same family due to similarities in dentition, they are no longer considered to be closely related due to genetic studies.|$|E
40|$|Background: Conservation {{strategies}} {{derived from}} research {{carried out in}} one part of the range of a widely distributed species and then uniformly applied over multiple regions risk being ineffective due to regional variations in species-habitat relationships. This is particularly true at the edge of the range where information on animal movements and resource selection is often limited. Here, we investigate home range size, movement patterns and resource selection of <b>koalas</b> Phascolarctos cinereus in the semi-arid and arid landscapes of southwest Queensland, Australia. We placed collars with GPS units on 21 <b>koalas</b> in three biogeographic regions. Home range sizes, resource selection and movement patterns were examined across the three regions. Results: Habitat selectivity was highest at the more arid, western edge of the <b>koala’s</b> range with their occupancy restricted to riparian/drainage line habitats, while the more easterly <b>koalas</b> displayed more variability in habitat use. There was no significant difference between home range sizes of <b>koalas</b> at the western edge of the range compared to the more easterly <b>koalas.</b> Instead, variability in home range size was attributed to spatial variations in habitat quality or the availability of a key resource, with a strong influence of rainfall and the presence of freestanding water on the home range size of <b>koalas.</b> Within a 580 m spatial range, movement patterns of male and female paths showed a tortuous trend, consistent with foraging behavior.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} whether analogues of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) could be used to both induce an acute testosterone response and suppress anterior pituitary function in male <b>koalas,</b> and induce a luteal phase in female <b>koalas.</b> Experiment 1 characterised the steroidogenic response of male <b>koalas</b> to administration of 30 μg (4. 3 μg kg– 1) natural-sequence GnRH. Intra-muscular injection of natural-sequence GnRH induced the release of LH and testosterone with peak concentrations at 30 min (3. 7 ± 1. 9 ng mL– 1) and 2 h (5. 4 ± 0. 5 ng mL– 1), respectively. In Experiment 2, a single injection of the GnRH antagonist acyline (100 μg (14. 3 μg kg– 1) or 500 μg (71. 4 μg kg– 1)) did not influence the testosterone response to subsequent injections of natural-sequence GnRH. In Experiment 3, 4 μg (~ 0. 67 μg kg– 1) of the GnRH agonist buserelin induced a luteal phase in five female <b>koalas</b> based on a LH surge, secretion of progestogen, and a normal-length oestrous cycle. The findings have shown that (1) natural-sequence GnRH can be used to test gonadotroph cell function and determine the testosterone-secreting capacity of male <b>koalas,</b> (2) the GnRH antagonist, acyline, at the dose rates used, does not suppress the pituitary-testis axis in male <b>koalas,</b> and (3) the GnRH agonist, buserelin, induces a normal luteal phase in female <b>koalas...</b>|$|R
