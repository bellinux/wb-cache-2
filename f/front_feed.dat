5000|$|Beam {{waveguide}} antennas {{are used}} in large radio telescopes and satellite communication stations {{as an alternative to}} the most common parabolic antenna design, the conventional [...] "front fed" [...] parabolic antenna. In <b>front</b> <b>feed,</b> the antenna feed, the small antenna that transmits or receives the radio waves reflected by the dish, is suspended at the focus, in front of the dish. However, this location causes a number of practical difficulties. In high performance systems, complex transmitter and receiver electronics must be located at the feed antenna. This feed equipment usually requires high maintenance; some examples are water cooling for transmitters and cryogenic cooling for sensitive receivers. With the large dishes used in these systems, the focus is high off the ground, and servicing requires cranes or scaffolds, and outdoor work with delicate equipment high off the ground. Furthermore, the feeds themselves have to be designed to handle outdoor conditions such as rain and large temperature swings, and to work while tipped at any angle.|$|E

Time series samples were collected at {{a total of five}} stations along 140 _E in the region of the Antarctic Divergence (AD). The numerically dominant species was Eukrohnia hamata, averaging over 80 % of the collected specimens. This species was most abundant north of the AD where bi-modal distribution was common. No species displayed regular diel vertical migration nor were their vertical distribution restricted by hydrographic clines. Breeding of E. hamata appeared unaffected by water conditions-the same maturity stages were present in similar percentages across the water masses. Vertical segregation of size classes among E. hamata was clearest north of the AD in a more stratified water column. In other locations, the size classes overlapped considerably; this is likely due to physical forcing from mixing water. Feeding activity of E. hamata was lowest within the AD and increased both north and south on the edges of the <b>front.</b> <b>Feeding</b> activity appeared continuous with no recognizable diel pattern. E. hamata containing prey items were smaller north of the AD compared to the south, suggesting two separate populations.

500|$|In {{the western}} North Atlantic, {{porbeagles}} feed mainly on pelagic fishes and squid in spring, and on groundfishes in the fall; this pattern {{corresponds to the}} spring-fall migration of these sharks from deeper to shallower waters, and the most available prey types in those respective habitats.

Hunting porbeagles regularly dive from the surface {{all the way to the}} bottom, cycling back every few hours; this vertical movement may aid in the detection of olfactory cues.

40|$|The ban by 2013 in the EU of {{individual}} accommodations for gestating sows and the renewed interest for litter systems could promote {{in the future}} the group-housing of gestating sows on litter. But what are {{the environmental impacts of}} this rearing technique? To answer this question, a study was scheduled to quantify pollutant gas emissions (nitrous oxide -N 2 O-, methane -CH 4 -, carbon dioxide -CO 2 - and ammonia -NH 3 -) according to floor type in the raising of group-housed gestating sows. The trial was carried out in experimental rooms located at Liège University (Belgium). Three successive batches of 10 gestating sows were used for this trial. Each batch was divided into 2 homogeneous groups randomly allocated to one of two treatments: concrete slatted floor or straw-based deep litter. The groups were kept separately in two identical rooms equipped with a pen divided into a lying area (slatted floor or deep litter) and five individual feeding stalls. The feeding stalls were equipped with <b>front</b> <b>feeding</b> troughs and rear gates preventing access to the stalls outside of the feeding time. Between each batch of sows, the pens were cleaned. In both rooms, ventilation was automatically adapted to maintain a constant ambient temperature. The gas emissions were measured 3 times (weeks 2, 5 and 8 of stay) during 6 consecutive days by infra red photoacoustic detection. Sow performance (body weight gain, backfat thickness, number and weight of piglets) was not significantly affected by floor type. With sows kept on slatted floor, gaseous emissions were significantly greater for NH 3 (12. 77 vs. 9. 05 g d- 1 sow- 1; P 0. 05). In conclusion, the main environmental disadvantage of the deep litter system pointed to in this study was the greater N 2 O-emissions and thus greater CO 2 eq-emissions compared to slatted floor. However, the use of deep litter was related to reduced NH 3 - and CH 4 -emissions. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Using {{extensive}} direct numerical simulations, {{the dynamics}} of laminar-turbulent fronts in pipe flow is investigated for Reynolds numbers between Re= 2000 and 5500. We here investigate the physical distinction between the fronts of weak and strong slugs both by analysing the turbulent kinetic energy budget and by comparing the downstream front motion to the advection speed of bulk turbulent structures. Our study shows that weak downstream fronts travel slower than turbulent structures in the bulk and correspond to decaying turbulence at the front. At Re≃ 2900 the downstream front speed becomes faster than the advection speed, marking the onset of strong fronts. In contrast to weak fronts, turbulent eddies are generated at strong <b>fronts</b> by <b>feeding</b> on the downstream laminar flow.

40|$|Abstract. Determination {{of levels}} of {{tolerance}} in delaminated composite panels {{is an important}} issue in composite structures technology. The primary intention is to analyse delaminated composite panels and estimate Strain Energy Release Rate (SERR) parameters at the delamination <b>front</b> to <b>feed</b> into acceptability criteria. Large deformation analysis is necessary to cater for excessive rotational deformations in the delaminated sublaminate. Modified Virtual Crack Closure Integral (MVCCI) is used to estimate all the three SERR components at the delamination front from the finite element output containing displacements, strains and stresses. The applied loading conditions are parti-cularly critical and compressive loading on the panel could lead to buckling of the delaminated sublaminate and consequent growth of delamination. Numerical results are presented for circular delamination of various sizes and delamination at various interfaces (varying depth-wise location) between the base- and the sub-laminates. Numerical data are also presented on the effect of bi-axial loading and in particular on compressive loading in both directions. The results can be used to estimate delamination tolerance at various depths (or at various interfaces) in the laminate...|$|R
40|$|Exploration in a blind {{prospect}} {{has led to}} {{the confirmation}} of a geothermal resource at Blue Mt. Nevada. The latest results include drilling of three production wells into Piedmont faults. These wells produce from a 185 to 190 ºC dilute benign brine reservoir. Short flow tests have shown prolific flow rates and indications of reservoir continuity. Well entries have shown that system permeability is fault-dominated. This is confirmed by the results of seismic reflection imaging. Young faulting in the area includes intersecting range front faults that strike NW, NS, and NE. Exposure of basement rock outboard from the segmented range front reveals a long history of hydrothermal activity in this complex fault intersection zone. The current conceptual model suggests that geothermal fluids equilibrate at up to 250 ºC at depth in NE-trending Piedmont faults off the range <b>front.</b> Upflow <b>feeds</b> an artesian reservoir at 190 ºC in the fault zone and then rises into a widespread shallow warm aquifer.

Two areas deserve special attention due to the steep gradients introduced by the outflow of important sources of continental waters: the Rio de la Plata and the Magellan Strait to the north and south of the study area.

40|$|In pig production, the {{interest}} for litter systems in relation with animal welfare and the ban by 2013 in the EU of individual accommodations for gestating sows could promote the group-housing of gestating sows on deep-litter. However, compared to slatted-floor systems, few {{data are available}} on the gaseous emissions associated with the different modalities of rearing sows on deep-litter. In this study, two modalities were compared: group housing on a 3 m 2 /sow deep-litter or on a 1. 8 m 2 /sow deep-litter plus 1. 2 m 2 /sow concrete floor. In both cases, sows were fed in individual feeding stalls (1. 2 m 2 /stall) but the access was limited at feeding time in the first case and permanent in the second one. Three successive batches of 10 gestating sows were used. Each batch was divided into 2 homogeneous groups randomly allocated to one of two treatments: fully (3 m 2 /sow) or partly (1. 8 m 2 /sow) straw-based deep-bedded floor. The groups were kept separately in two identical rooms with same volume and same surface, equipped with five individual feeding stalls in contact with a pen of either 9 or 15 m 2 deep-litter. The feeding stalls were equipped with <b>front</b> <b>feeding</b> troughs and rear gates allowing or not permanent access to the stalls outside of feeding times. Between each batch, the pens were cleaned. In both rooms, ventilation was automatically adapted to maintain a constant ambient temperature. The gas emissions (nitrous oxide, methane, carbon dioxide, ammonia and water vapour) were measured 3 times (weeks 2, 5 and 8 of stay) during 6 consecutive days by infrared photoacoustic detection. Sow performance was not significantly affected by floor type. With sows kept on partly bedded floor, gaseous emissions were significantly greater for methane (12. 76 vs. 9. 90 g/d. sow; P 0. 05). From the present trial in experimental rooms, it can be concluded that keeping group-housed gestating sows on partly straw bedded floor with permanent access to the concrete feeding stalls compared to fully straw bedded floor did not significantly influence animal performance and NH 3 -emissions, and decreased CO 2 eq-emissions (- 40 %). This decrease was observed owing to an important decrease of N 2 O-emissions (- 49 %). Peer reviewe...|$|R
