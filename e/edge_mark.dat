40|$|This paper compares two manual {{measurement}} techniques for measuring retinal vessel segment widths: the kick-points technique and the <b>edge</b> <b>marking</b> technique. An image set of 164 clear, high-resolution segments was used. The kick-points approach uses kick points marked by observers along interpolated cross-sectional intensity profile graphs; the <b>edge</b> <b>marking</b> method allows observers to nominate the edges on a zoomed-up image, and interpolates edge positions. The edgemarking method provides more precise measurements than the kick-points method, {{but these are}} subject to more inter-observer variability; we speculate that this result is due to differing observer perceptions of the edge location...|$|R

50|$|For {{the first}} alternative, marking packets with the router's IP address, {{analysis}} {{shows that in}} order to gain the correct attack path with 95% accuracy as many as 294,000 packets are required. The second approach, edge marking, requires that the two nodes that make up an <b>edge</b> <b>mark</b> the path with their IP addresses along with the distance between them. This approach would require more state information in each packet than simple node marking but would converge much faster. They suggest three ways to reduce the state information of these approaches into something more manageable.|$|E
5000|$|Its core {{components}} are digits, locatives, marks and movements which {{are written in}} a fairly rigid order (though in a fairly flexible configuration) from left to right. Its digits are representations of handshapes - or {{the configuration of the}} hand and fingers - where the locatives represent locations on the body (or, in theory, in space), the marks represent anything from location (e.g., <b>edge</b> <b>mark)</b> to small movements (e.g., flutter) to facial expressions (e.g., raised eyebrow mark [...] ) and the movements indicate the movement of the hands in space by modifying the digits (and for shoulder shift /head nod modifying the body).|$|E
40|$|Slicing is {{generally}} based on program code. An alternative approach {{to compute the}} slice is from specifications developed using formalism such as Unified Modeling Languages(UML). UML is widely used for object-oriented modeling and design. In our research, we focus on UML communication diagram to compute the dynamic slices. We first develop a suitable intermediate representation for communication diagram named as Communication Dependence Graph (CoDG). Then, we propose two dynamic slicing algorithms. We have named the first algorithm <b>edge</b> <b>marking</b> dynamic slicing algorithm for communnication diagram (EMACD) and the second node-marking dynamic slicing algorithm for communnication diagram (NMACD). We have implemented our algorithms and also calculated the space and time complexity. Aspect-oriented Programming (AOP) is a recent programming paradigm that focuses on modular implementations of various crosscutting concerns. In our research, we proposed a technique for dynamic slicing of aspect-oriented software based on the UML communication diagram. Next, we generate an intermediate representation from the communication diagram which we named as Communication Aspect Dependency Graph (CADG). Then, we proposed an <b>edge</b> <b>marking</b> dynamic slicing algorithm named as Aspect-Oriented <b>Edge</b> <b>Marking</b> Algorithm (AOEM). The novelty in our approach is that we present the communication diagram for the aspect-oriented software. We have implemented the algorithm and also found the space and time complexity of the algorithm...|$|R
