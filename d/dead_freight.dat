They died at the Rocks, they were poisoned at the Summit, and they starved at the Lakes; they fell off the trail, what there was of it, or they went through it; in the river they drowned under their loads, or were smashed to pieces against the boulders; they snapped their legs in the crevices and broke their backs falling backwards with their packs; in the sloughs they sank from sight or smothered in the slime, and they were disembowelled in the bogs where the corduroy logs turned end up in the mud; men shot them, worked them to death, and when they were gone, went back to the beach and bought more. Some did not bother to shoot them,--stripping the saddles off and the shoes and leaving them where they fell. Their hearts turned to stone--those which did not break--and they became beasts, the men on Dead Horse Trail.|$|R

50|$|The {{cesser clause}} {{has come into}} common use because, frequently, the charterers are not {{personally}} interested in the cargo. They may be merely agents, or may have chartered the vessel as a speculation {{to make a profit}} upon the bill of lading freight. The effect of the clause is that by the charterers shipping a full cargo, they fulfill all their obligations. The shipowner discharges them from further liability and takes instead a lien on the cargo for payment of all freight, demurrage, or <b>dead</b> <b>freight</b> that is payable. It has become established {{in the construction of the}} cesser clause that, if the language permits it, the cesser of liability is assumed co-extensive only with the lien given to the shipowner. In other words, the charterers are only released from liabilities that have been replaced by a lien given to the shipowner.|$|E
50|$|Some clauses {{specify the}} amount of freight to pay and the manner and time of payment. A clause may specify the length of time, usually {{described}} as lay days, for loading and discharging, and for the demurrage to pay if the vessel is detained beyond the lay days. There is usually also a clause that requires that the merchant bear the risk and expense to bring the cargo to the ship and collect it on delivery. Another clause specifies that the master must sign bills of lading for the cargo, either {{at the same rate}} payable under the charter-party, or commonly at any rate of freight (with a stipulation that, if the total bill of lading freight is less than the total freight payable under the charter-party, the charterers pay the difference to the master before the vessel sails). There is usually what is called the cesser clause, by which the charterer's liability under the charter-party ceases on shipment of the cargo, the shipowner taking a lien on the cargo for freight, <b>dead</b> <b>freight,</b> and demurrage. The charter-party is subject to exceptions similar to those in bills of lading. Typically, other clauses provide for commissions paid to the brokers on signing the charter-party, the address commission paid to the agents for the Vessel at the port of discharge, and other details. Clauses in charter-parties vary, but the above outlines what is typical.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} problem of inland {{waterways}} fisheries is the transportation of fish from ponds to fish market during low tide trough inland waterways with 0. 6 m water depth. The boat is experiences grounding due to water depth of the river is not sufficient for the fishing boat to carry fish at it’s maximum 2 tones capacity or experience <b>dead</b> <b>freight.</b> This condition forces fisherman {{to wait until the}} high tide from the sea, this delay causes the quality of the fish is decreasing. Besides the problem dead freight  problem the existing vessel is causes environmental problem such as erosion of the river bank due to wake wash. The other important issue is the increases of fuel price and it’s scarcity.   This paper presents the results of comparison of existing monohull fishing boat and two other alternativecatamaran designs. The catamaran design alternatives are is ordinary catamaran and flat side catamaran.  Both of the catamaran fishing boat design shows that the catamaran boat with 0. 5 m draft is able to carry more than 2 tonnes payload during low tide water depth.   The CFD simulation results shows that flat side catamaran resistance is more than 17. 7 % lower compared to ordinary catamaran and 44 % lower compared to monohull. It means that the consumption of flat side catamaran is lowest compared to two other type of hull design. The flat side catamaran also produces lowest wake wash compared to o two other design. The low wake wash means more friendly to environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{expectations}} {{placed in}} telecommunications {{as a universal}} solution to all problems' within the road haulage sector are high. Its application is expected to improve the exchange of information, to support the cooperation between the actors, to deepen the integration of transport chains and to avoid the high proportion of <b>dead</b> <b>freight.</b> The case of Electronic Trading Networks (ETN), which is analyzed in this study, reveals - despite these advantages - restrained acceptance and a low penetration of the market. The real development of diffusion {{does not meet the}} high expectations of the use of telecommunications. For this reason, we try to answer the key question: What are the critical factors, influencing the application, the adoption and the diffusion of value added services in the transportation sector? The analysis shows that ETN merely supports a part of the market process. Only under particular conditions, it will lead to falling costs and higher market transparency. Therefore, the effects on increasing productivity within the enterprises are reduced. The realization of rationalization potentials by value added services is confronted with problems concerning the user acceptance, the distribution of profits and the lacking familiarity with information and communication technologies. Further critical factors are the undesirable effects of increasing market transparence, the surplus of transport capacities, the anonymity of ETN and the decreasing demand of standardized transportation services. The current development within the transportation sector leads to a fundamental structural change, which will improve the market chances of ETN for certain forms of usage. The hypothesis that strategies of improving the efficiency within enterprises do not necessarily result in an increasing rationality of the transport sector and to the avoidance of traffic, has been confirmed. The 'problem solving character' of telecommunications is widely overestimated. The use of telecommunications can only be successful, if the prevailing conditions and the change of the organizational surroundings will prepare and support such effects. ' (author's abstract) 'In der Studie wird der zentralen Fragestellung nachgegangen, welche kritischen Erfolgsfaktoren die Nutzung, Adoption und Diffusion von telekommunikationsbasierten Fracht- und Laderaumausgleichssystemen beeinflussen. Die Untersuchung basiert auf der systematischen Auswertung der einschlaegigen Sekundaeranalysen und Fallstudien. Da empirische Daten ueber die Nutzung von Telekommunikation im Gueterverkehr bisher nicht vorliegen, wurden strukturierte Interviews mit den Anbietern von Fracht- und Laderaumausgleichssystemen, mit den Repraesentanten grosser und kleiner Speditionsunternehmen sowie weiteren Experten durchgefuehrt. Aufbauend auf eine Darstellung der Verkehrsentwicklung und des Einsatzes von Telematik im Gueterverkehr sowie der Beschreibung moderner elektronischer Fracht- und Laderaumausgleichssysteme werden die Erfahrungen mit dem Einsatz dieser Systeme evaluiert. Die Analyse zeigt, dass telekommunikationsbasierte Kooperation lediglich einen bestimmten Teil des Marktprozesses unterstuetzt und nur unter bestimmten Bedingungen zu sinkenden Transaktionskosten und hoeherer Markttransparenz fuehrt. Insgesamt erhoeht sich das 'Problemloesungspotential' der Telekommunikation im Gueterverkehr um so eher, je mehr ein Wandel des organisatorischen Umfeldes positive Wirkungen vorbereitet und unterstuetzt.

Die Ergebnisse der Analyse der zukuenftigen Verkehrsentwicklung sowie der Ursachen des strukturellen Wandels und der Rahmenbedingungen des Gueterverkehrssektors zeigen, dass der Stellenwert der Telekommunikation als Beitrag zur Loesung der Verkehrsprobleme waechst. Es wird deutlich, dass zum einen der Strukturwandel des Gueterverkehrs die Diffusion und Adoption von Telekommunikationsanwendungen durch einen erhoehten Anpassungsdruck beschleunigt, und zum anderen neue Informations- und Kommunikationstechniken eine wesentliche Voraussetzung zur Ueberwindung infrastruktureller und umweltpolitisch bedingter, gesellschaftspolitischer 'Engpassfaktoren' sind. Der Autor kommt zu dem Schluss, dass die Dynamik und die Veraenderung im verkehrlichen Umfeld die Bedingungen fuer elektronische Kooperationssysteme verbessern und auf Seiten der Spediteure zu einer Neubewertung derjenigen Faktoren fuehren werden, die bisher fuer die zoegerliche Nutzung ausschlaggebend waren. ' (Autorenreferat) 'Within {{the recent}} {{discussion}} in transportation research, Electronic Trading Networks (ETN) for {{the exchange of}} cargo and loading space are regarded as a possibility to optimize the logistics management and to strengthen the co-operation between forwarding agents. The improved availability of information shall contribute to a better capacity utilization and shall avoid <b>dead</b> <b>freight.</b> In spite of these advantages, ETN has not yet become fully accepted in the Federal Republic of Germany. In this study, the role of telecommunications and ETN is analysed {{in the context of}} road traffic development. By presenting some case examples, we try to answer the question, which circumstances have prevented a broader diffusion of telecommunication based cooperation systems until now and how the rationalities of the actors are influenced by the prevailing conditions in the transportation sector. Starting with the analysis on the future traffic development, the reasons for the structural change, and the prevailing conditions of the road haulage sector, the role of telecommunications as a solution of traffic problems is examined. It becomes obvious that the structural change in the road haulage sector not only accelerates the diffusion and adaptation of telecommunications by increasing the pressures on the forwarding agents. The adaptation of telecommunications also forms a fundamental precondition to overcome infrastructural, environmental and social defiles. By an increasing diffusion of information technology, measures of deregulation of the EC-markets, growing pressures of competition and higher quality requirements for logistical services, ETN based co-operation will become a key question especially for small and medium enterprises. There are many indications that the dynamics of change in the transportation environment will improve the conditions for a co-operation based on telematics and will induce a re-assessement of the factors, which caused the hesitant demand. Assessing the consequences of ETN on traffic, a broad empirical analysis within the participating enterprises is needed, but not yet available. It is highly probable that we are confronted with ambivalent effects. That means that the traffic avoiding effects of telecommunications based co-operation systems may be compensated by the traffic inducing effects.
