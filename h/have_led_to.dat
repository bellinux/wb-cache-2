5|$|The {{allegations}} were first sparked by University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran, {{who claimed that}} full versions of government documents proved Canada had willful knowledge that torture would occur before handing detainees to Afghan authorities. Subsequent to this, two official complaints <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> official investigations and hearings by the Military Police Complaints Commission (MPCC). One of these unveiled parliamentary testimony by diplomat Richard Colvin, who claimed that many detainees were probably tortured, {{and it was a}} standard operating procedure for Afghan interrogators. The allegations <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a showdown in the Canadian House of Commons, as opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) had called for the releasing of relevant documents in full and unredacted form, claiming parliamentary privilege to see them. The government maintained that they had a duty to protect Canadian soldiers and citizens as the documents contained sensitive information.|$|E

5|$|The {{fact that}} Munro, an {{excellent}} observer who spent years on Lānai, only saw the bird three times implies {{that it was}} already very rare by the 1910s. From 1900 to 1940 nearly all of Lānai's forests were converted into pineapple fields. This conversion reduced {{the area of the}} hookbill's potential habitat, and {{is believed to be the}} biggest contributor to the species' extinction. It has also been suggested that avian malaria, which began affecting Lānai's birds in the 1920s, may have contributed to the species' decline. Likewise, the introduction of feral cats and rats to Lānai may <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a decline in the hookbill's population. The extinction of local snails through human intervention could also <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the Lānai hookbill's extinction.|$|E
5|$|The initial accretional heating {{together}} with continued decay of radioactive elements may <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> melting {{of the ice}} if an antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of ammonia hydrate) or some salt was present. The melting may <b>have</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water (ocean) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core–mantle boundary. The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176K. The ocean, however, {{is likely to have}} frozen long ago. Among Uranian moons Umbriel was least subjected to endogenic resurfacing processes, although it may like other Uranian moons have experienced a very early resurfacing event.|$|E
