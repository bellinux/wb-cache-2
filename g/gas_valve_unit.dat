40|$|In 2014 {{there were}} 50 {{liquefied}} natural gas (LNG) fuelled ships in operation and around 70 on order worldwide. LNG proves to emit less pollution and considering {{the present and future}} emission regulations and optimistic gas fuel prices, LNG would be a preferable option as a marine fuel. The number of LNG fuelled ships is therefore likely to increase significantly the next five to ten years. There are many ways to configure the fuel supply system. The fuel supply system consists of a tank, heat exchangers and a <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> <b>unit</b> (GVU) that are connected by pipes and valves. The focus area of this study was the low-pressure (LP) LNG fuel supply system. Three different LP LNG fuel supply systems was studied and optimized in this thesis: 	CASE 1 : Supply system with two shell-and tube exchangers. 	CASE 2 : Supply system with one shell-and-tube exchanger. 	CASE 3 : Supply system with one compact exchanger and one shell-and-tube exchanger. The modeling, simulations and optimization for these three cases were done in the commercial simulation tool Aspen HYSYS and the additional HYSYS-software, Exchanger Design & Rating (EDR). The simulations showed how dependent the process parameters were on the other system parameters. Further, a sensitivity analysis performed gave an understanding of how the mechanical parameters of the heat exchanger affect the overall design including thermal and hydraulic parameters such as heat transfer rate and pressure drop. For the optimization of the process parameters for the heat exchangers the inlet temperature difference of the two fluids, and type and mass flow of the heating medium was showed in this thesis to be vital. Mechanical parameters such as shell ID, tube OD and tube length were found to be vital parameters that affected not only the mechanical design but the thermal and hydraulic parameters as well. This study only focused on the heat exchangers in the regasification system, and factors such as the pressure loss in pipes and the pressure loss through valves and fittings are not included. To get an overall understanding of the complete fuel system including tank, pressure build-up (PBU) unit, piping system and other devices concerning regasification, heating or re-liquefaction, a further study can be conducted with a system including these components...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{combined}} {{main burner}} and pilot <b>gas</b> <b>valves</b> (mainly by Honeywell) reduce the power demand to {{within the range}} of a single universal thermocouple heated by a pilot (25 mV open circuit falling by half with the coil connected to a 10–12 mV, 0.2–0.25 A source, typically) by sizing the coil to be able to hold the valve open against a light spring, but only after the initial turning-on force is provided by the user pressing and holding a knob to compress the spring during lighting of the pilot. These systems are identifiable by the [...] "press and hold for x minutes" [...] in the pilot lighting instructions. (The holding current requirement of such a valve is much less than a bigger solenoid designed for pulling the valve in from a closed position would require.) Special test sets are made to confirm the valve let-go and holding currents, because an ordinary milliammeter cannot be used as it introduces more resistance than the <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> coil. Apart from testing the open circuit voltage of the thermocouple, and the near short-circuit DC continuity through the thermocouple <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> coil, the easiest non-specialist test is substitution of a known good <b>gas</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R
25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both {{open and close}} the main <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot <b>gas</b> <b>valve,</b> it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner <b>gas</b> supply <b>valve</b> should that not happen.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Diaphragm {{gas meter}} is a {{specialized}} flow meter that measures {{the volume of}} fuel gas such as natural gas and coal <b>gas.</b> <b>Valve</b> bonnet and valve seat are the key parts of diaphragm gas meter, which compose the main factors of its metering error. The widely detecting ways are direct observational method and pneumatic pressure method. Direct observational method only realizes the qualitative detection with lacking science. Pneumatic pressure method can realize the quantitative detection, but with low accuracy and bad reliability. In order to evaluate the gas tightness of diaphragm <b>gas</b> meter <b>valve</b> accurately, surface texture method was adopted. Firstly, the surface roughness mathematical model of valve working face was established. A fast Gaussian filtering convolution algorithm was proposed based on the symmetry of Gaussian density function. Secondly, the working face of <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> on the high-precision air floating stage was scanned by the chromatic confocal sensor. And the roughness profile of valve working face was got through the fast Gaussian filter when the cut-off wavelength was 0. 8 mm. Then the roughness parameters could be calculated with MATLAB by setting the sampling length and evaluation length. The results show that surface roughness has a difference of over 1 µm between the qualified and unqualified valve. Besides, {{there is a little}} deviation of below 9 % between the experimental value and the stylus profilometer measuring value, which has no influence on the judging result of qualified or unqualified about the measured workpiece. The gas tightness performance of <b>gas</b> <b>valve</b> can be judged by measuring surface roughness of its working face, which can provide a scientific basis for evaluating the quality of diaphragm <b>gas</b> meter <b>valve</b> in a quantitative way. 1...|$|R
