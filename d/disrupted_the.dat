In Toledo City, the Carmen copper Concentrator had to temporarily shut down after a landslide <b>disrupted</b> <b>the</b> facility's water supply.

5|$|After {{the events}} of the 2011 Tōhoku {{earthquake}} and tsunami <b>disrupted</b> <b>the</b> development schedule for downloadable content for Fate of Two Worlds, the additional content was created into a standalone title, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, for a discounted retail price. The game received generally positive reviews upon release; critics praised the expanded character roster and improved online experience, but criticized the lack of new features and game modes. A sequel, titled , was released in September 2017.|$|E
5|$|Although 47 Ursae Majoris b {{is outside}} its star's {{habitable}} zone, its gravitational influence would disrupt {{the orbit of}} planets in the outer part of the habitable zone. In addition, it may have <b>disrupted</b> <b>the</b> formation of terrestrial planets and reduced the delivery of water to any inner planets in the system. Therefore, planets located in the habitable zone of 47 Ursae Majoris {{are likely to be}} small and dry.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the Jurchens the Song dynasty was for centuries engaged in a {{stand-off}} against the Western Xia and the Khitan Liao dynasty. This balance was disrupted when the Song dynasty developed a military alliance with the Jurchens for the purpose of annihilating the Liao. This balance of power <b>disrupted,</b> <b>the</b> Jurchens then turned on the Song, resulting in the fall of the Northern Song and the subsequent establishment of the Southern Song.|$|E
5|$|Family {{and family}} history also plays an {{important}} role in the poem. Eliot found information on his family from Sketch of the Eliot Family, which described how Eliot's family lived in East Coker for 200 years. When Andrew Eliott left, he <b>disrupted</b> <b>the</b> family history. Similarly, Eliot broke from his own family when he travelled away from his family, a family that he saw was declining. Within the poem, Eliot emphasizes the need for a journey and the need for inward change.|$|E

5|$|HAT-P-33b was {{difficult}} to confirm because its star experiences high jitter, which <b>disrupted</b> <b>the</b> ability to obtain accurate measurements. As such, {{a greater number of}} radial velocity observations were collected to make the confirmation, although it was later determined that HAT-P-33b could not be determined using the radial velocity method. The planet's confirmation came about after the planet's light curve was collected, and the Blendanal process ruled out most false positive scenarios.|$|E
5|$|In total, about $48 {{million in}} revenue was lost, and over $10 million was spent on {{expenses}} related to preparing for and recovering from the shutdown. Overall, the shutdown <b>disrupted</b> <b>the</b> state government's activities, the lives of some Minnesotans (especially the most vulnerable), and private sector work such as road construction, but had minimal impact on the larger economy of the state.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent to {{its peak}} intensity, {{increasing}} westerly shear <b>disrupted</b> <b>the</b> storm's circulation and thermal pattern, which caused rapid weakening to tropical storm strength and later tropical depression status. By May22, the {{low pressure area}} became poorly defined after stalling south of Cuba; {{with only a few}} squalls and showers, advisories were discontinued on Alma. The remnants of Alma continued westward near the Cayman Islands, and later turned to the north, passing over western Cuba.|$|E

5|$|The German vessels {{were largely}} {{undamaged}} but the French lost their gunboat. Several of Papeete's buildings were destroyed and the town's economy was severely <b>disrupted.</b> <b>The</b> main strategic {{consequence of the}} engagement was the disclosure of the cruisers' positions to the British Admiralty, {{which led to the}} Battle of Coronel where the entire German East Asia Squadron defeated a Royal Navy squadron. The depletion of Scharnhorsts and Gneisenaus ammunition at Papeete also contributed to their subsequent destruction at the Battle of the Falklands.|$|E
5|$|The Syrians {{responded by}} {{launching}} about 100 fighter aircraft {{to stop the}} attacks. Intercepting IAF pilots relied frequently on VHF radio, in hopes of preserving their tactical communications and links to the command post. Selective airborne communications jamming <b>disrupted</b> <b>the</b> airwaves for the MiG-21s and MiG-23s and cut them off from ground control, making them vulnerable to AWACS-directed attacks from the Israeli F-15s and F-16s.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Nine {{formed from}} a {{tropical}} wave west of Cape Verde {{on the afternoon}} of August 4, the second Cape Verde-type storm of the season. The system encountered dry air and wind shear as it turned to the northwest and it broke down. Despite poor organization and shearing winds, it became Tropical Storm Irene on August 7. Further shear and dry air <b>disrupted</b> <b>the</b> cyclone's structure, and Irene was downgraded to a tropical depression on August 8.|$|E
5|$|About 17.8 percent——of {{the total}} forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which <b>disrupted</b> <b>the</b> {{ecological}} equilibrium. The persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of tree cover, {{and loss of}} seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or impossible) in many areas. Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as bamboo and cogon grass), making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely. Animal-species diversity was also impacted; in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 species of birds and five species of mammals in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammals.|$|E
