5|$|Meanwhile, <b>in</b> <b>Greece,</b> the Spartan king Agis III {{attempted}} {{to lead a}} rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans {{on the condition that}} they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular <b>in</b> <b>Greece</b> due to his practice (perhaps by order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian troops, yet in 330BC, Alexander declared that the tyrannies installed <b>in</b> <b>Greece</b> were to be abolished and Greek freedom was to be restored.|$|E

5|$|The 6th Division arrived <b>in</b> <b>Greece</b> in late March {{and early}} April 1941, where they joined with a New Zealand and British force. On 6 April, the Germans began their {{invasion}} of Greece, sending {{a total of}} 27 divisions. After arriving <b>in</b> <b>Greece,</b> the Australians were transported north towards the Yugoslav border, where they took up defensive positions around the Florina Valley. During the fighting around Vevi that followed, troops from the 2/4th and 2/8th Infantry Battalions and the 2/3rd Field Regiment, from Brigadier George Vasey's 19th Brigade, fought against the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade. Despite their efforts, the Allied force, together with Greek units, was unable to halt the rapid German advance down central Greece towards Athens. The Allies were outflanked by the Germans, and by 27 April they were driven off the Greek mainland, with a final act of defiance being made around Porto Rafti. The division's casualties <b>in</b> <b>Greece</b> amounted to 320 killed, 494 wounded and 2,030 captured.|$|E
