5|$|Portia de Rossi as Veronica Palmer: Veronica is Ted's {{boss and}} {{immediate}} supervisor at Veridian Dynamics. She maintains a fierce and unapproachable workplace demeanor, and many employees {{have a deep}} fear of her. She seems cold and calculating, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that she has more than grudging respect for Ted, and often recognizes what moral action is necessary to maintain balance in the workplace. An ongoing subplot touched on sporadically in the first season but more frequently in the second sees Veronica becoming a mentor to Linda and, to a lesser degree, Rose.|$|E
5|$|Skara Brae, Maeshowe, the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness {{together}} {{form the}} Heart of Neolithic Orkney UNESCO World Heritage Site {{in the western}} part of the Orkney Mainland and which was inscribed in 1999. This small area has provided a rich archaeological heritage in a location that is relatively remote from both the main centres of population in Scotland and from more densely populated parts of Europe. However, it would be a mistake to imagine that because Orkney is so placed today that this was always so. There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that a variety of the smaller islands in the British Isles developed an advanced society in the Neolithic that took several centuries longer to develop on the mainland of Great Britain. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that whilst the flow of ideas and technologies in Britain has often been from the south to the north, that at this time, it is evident that Orkney played a significant role in the development of British Neolithic culture.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle {{was thought}} to have been founded {{during the second half of}} the 14th century, as the first {{accurate}} historical accounts of the castle date back to the mid-14th century, when most of the territories of western Rus' were under control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. A written document by Prince Yuriy Koriatovych in 1374, for example, mentions that the Magdeburg rights would be presented to Kamianets inside the castle. Archaeological excavations during the 1960s, however, provided contrasting evidence suggesting that the castle might date back even earlier to the end of the 12th or the beginning of the 13th centuries. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> from historical and archaeological evidence that an earthen fortress existed in the area during the time of the East Slavic state of Kievan Rus', but not on the same site as the current castle.|$|E

50|$|But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> rocket attacks {{devastated the}} morale of enemy troops - many {{vehicles}} were found abandoned intact, or with only superficial damage. Interrogation of captured prisoners showed that even the prospect of rocket attack was extremely unnerving for them.|$|R
50|$|At the time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that Rensselaer <b>was</b> {{lacking in}} its {{collection}} {{when compared to}} its peers. In 1967, James E. Skipper, a researcher for the Association of Research Libraries, compiled a table illustrating the collections of various universities in New York.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that {{elements}} in the narrative are drawn from the much later expeditions undertaken by Magnus Barefoot.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the}} captain of the {{aircraft}} who is a pilot of great experience and exceptional ability was in no way to blame.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, these {{vascular}} {{interventions are}} often done only after {{an individual is}} symptomatic, often already partially disabled, {{as a result of}} the disease. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that both angioplasty and bypass interventions do not prevent future heart attack.|$|E
50|$|The inter-receptor {{angles of}} Portias eyes {{may be as}} small as 2.4 minutes of arc, which is only six times worse than in humans, and is six times better than in the most acute insect eye. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clearer</b> in {{daylight}} than a cats vision.|$|R
60|$|It {{became clear}} to Dr. Martineau that Sir Richmond was to be let off Belinda. It seemed abominably unjust. And <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> {{to him that he}} must keep closely to his own room or he might find Miss Seyffert {{drifting}} back alone to the hotel and eager to resume with him....|$|R
5000|$|Bazargan {{resigned}} {{along with}} his cabinet on 4 November 1979 following the US Embassy takeover and hostage-taking. His resignation was considered a protest against the hostage-taking and a recognition of his government's inability to free the hostages, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that his hopes for liberal democracy and an accommodation with the West would not prevail.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the}} tomb was re-entered {{at a later}} time, almost {{certainly}} during the 20th Dynasty. At this time, any additional, hypothetical occupants of the tomb would have been removed and (possibly) relocated to KV35, while the remaining mummy {{and some of the}} other artefacts were desecrated and abandoned.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} that, {{by the early}} 18th Century, the type of dog known as the 'Setter' had come into its own right. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> the Irish had begun {{actively}} breeding their own type. For example, the de Freyne family of French Park began keeping detailed stud records in 1793. Other prominent landed Irish gentry also {{known to have been}} breeding setter lines at the same time include Lord Clancarty, Lord Dillon, and the Marquis of Waterford.|$|E
25|$|Wetti's visions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} Frankish perceptions of the afterlife, its appearance, and the punishments reserved for sinners. Furthermore, what explicitly appears in Wetti's visions not only reveals {{a great deal about}} his perspectives on wealth, lust, gender relations and monastic responsibility, but also the degree to which these issues (excluding monasticism) pervaded all levels of lay and religious officialdom in 9th-century Carolingian France. Clearly, he saw these as something debasing and degrading Frankish society, however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that because of his monastic training in humility, he felt all but unable to speak out against them.|$|E
50|$|The Principia covered only set theory, {{cardinal}} numbers, ordinal numbers, {{and real}} numbers. Deeper theorems from real analysis were not included, {{but by the}} end of the third volume <b>it</b> <b>was</b> clear to experts that a large amount of known mathematics could in principle be developed in the adopted formalism. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> how lengthy such a development would be.|$|R
5|$|Lazio's bid was {{handicapped}} by {{the weak}} performance of George W. Bush in New York in the 2000 election, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> Hillary Clinton had made substantial inroads in upstate New York prior to Lazio's {{entry into the}} race. Exit polls also showed a large gender gap with Clinton running stronger than expected among moderate women and unaffiliated women.|$|R
50|$|ILG/Air Europe's senior {{management}} {{was aware that}} ILG had been facing a cash crunch from as early as 1989. This had made it {{more and more difficult}} for the group to finance the aircraft it already had on order, notably the F100s and the MD-11s. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> to them that ILG did not have sufficient funds to run a fully fledged, rapidly growing scheduled operation in addition to a major charter operation.|$|R
25|$|Increases in the {{security}} surrounding rich infrastructure targets in Britain also had a major effect on IRA team's ability to conduct operations. The seizure of war material and inability to get newly acquired war material into Britain under wartime restrictions meant increased improvisation, which in turn led to increased exposure to discovery. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that the campaign generated {{a good deal of}} anti-Irish sentiment, which increased the British public's suspicion of Irish people in general. All these factors led to attacks tapering off around early to mid-1940. The death of Seán Russell on 14 August 1940, (he had already been effectively incommunicado since April 1939), and the succession of Stephen Hayes as IRA Chief of Staff also contributed to the petering out of the attacks.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{relied on}} depots much less {{frequently}} laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes {{were marked by}} the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag. As a result, Scott has much concern recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close calls about finding depots. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that Scott's team did not travel on several days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking {{they would have been}} able to travel on more days with a following wind which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.|$|E
25|$|Failure of the South Vietnamese {{leadership}} {{to develop an}} effective political narrative and civil/military administration. Some of this failure {{grew out of the}} difficult conditions in which South Vietnam was initially established, with a weak political and military organization that compared poorly with the well-oiled machine of the North. This initial weakness was also reflected in political instability, endemic corruption, inefficient administration and military incompetence. Despite these vulnerabilities however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that millions of South Vietnamese opposed the takeover of their society by a communist dictatorship and fought resolutely against this outcome. The American failure was marked by its own set of shortcomings and miscalculations, but was inextricably linked to South Vietnamese difficulties, some historians maintain. Ultimate settlement of the conflict was between the Vietnamese.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> not <b>clear</b> what {{constitutes}} an erroneous inclusion. <b>It</b> can <b>be</b> anything, from wrong coordinates to severe DOE misconduct or fraudulent information.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that {{something}} {{must now be}} done to loosen the grip of Ancient Greek on the educational system. Accordingly, in 1881, provision was officially made for the teaching of some katharevousa in Greek primary schools. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{the first time that}} anything other than Ancient Greek had been allowed in education. However, change was slow; some Ancient Greek continued to be taught in primary schools until 1917, and secondary schools were allowed nothing else until 1909.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, {{numerical}} {{results indicated}} that, in 6 PBP test, mode-III and mode-II components {{can be created}} by controlling load and support points. Also, comparison of fracture load showed that fracture load decreased with changing mixed-mode ratio (mode-III to mode-II dominate). Nonetheless, the 6 PBP test for mixed-mode III/II condition inevitably involved the non-uniform distribution of crack growth and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that mixed-mode III/II fracture required extensive investigation which should {{lead to the development}} of improved test methods.|$|R
25|$|The bricks used {{to build}} the house varied in quality and most were red in color. Samples found {{indicate}} that most were fired from a brownish local clay. The variation in each brick could be from experimentation or from badly collected material. While clearly fired, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> the bricks were not well fired. Their size varied between 1 1/2 and 3 inches in thickness. All the bricks found were of a period before standard modern bricks were available. The mortar was made up mostly of sand and coral. Two types were found: a lavender-colored mortar made of sand and coral (reduced by burning for its lime) was found {{through most of the}} remains {{with the exception of the}} east corner, where there was a brown mortar which was a softer mixture of mud sand and coral pieces.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} of the Church's history, celibacy was {{considered}} optional. Based on the customs of the times, it is assumed by many {{that most of the}} Apostles, such as Peter, were married and had families. It is clear from the New Testament (Mk 1:29–31; Mt 8:14–15; Lk 4:38–39; 1 Tim 3:2, 12; Tit 1:6) that at least Peter had been married, and that bishops, presbyters and deacons of the Early Church were often married as well. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> from epigraphy, the testimony of the Church Fathers, synodal legislation, papal decretals and other sources that in the following centuries a married clergy, in greater or lesser numbers, was a normal feature {{of the life of the}} Church. Celibacy was not required for those ordained, but still was a discipline practised in the early Church, particularly by those in the monastic life.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> {{from the}} law tracts that the {{practice}} of Sick Maintenance was being discarded. Thus, while Críth Gablach mentions some of what each individual is entitled to while being nursed according to his rank, it also mentions that the practice was no longer in use, and instead an additional fine encompassed the same provisions the injurer would have had to pay for under sick maintenance. Bretha Crólige does not mention anything about the practice being obsolete. However, it does mention that certain types of person could not be maintained because of the difficulty in doing so. Thus {{it was very hard to}} provision those of the highest rank and obviously impossible to find a substitute to do their work. Certain professionals could similarly be difficult. On the other hand, a number of persons could cause difficulty to the people maintaining the victim. Such troublesome individuals included the insane and women likely to cause trouble for those nursing them.|$|E
2500|$|Newspapers were censored {{from the}} start, with papers often {{carrying}} articles written by Germans who {{purported to be}} editors. Printing {{exactly what they were}} given, the bad English used in [...] "German" [...] articles gave away the propaganda items. During those months when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible to listen to the BBC openly <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> who <b>was</b> telling the truth. A Jersey paper written in Jersey French caused problems for the Germans as they could not translate it and it ceased production.|$|R
50|$|In trials <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} that the Class 43 was more economical to operate at powers under 1500 PSi. As a result, a further 25 examples of the 43 were ordered up to 1928. However, due {{to the increase in}} goods train speeds in the 1930s, the Class 44 was given priority thereafter because, in addition to its economy when running at higher speeds and the better running qualities of its three-cylinder driving gear, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>cleared</b> for running at up to 80 km/h.As a result, no more Class 43s were ordered.|$|R
60|$|As Lush had expected, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{addressed}} to Miss Harleth, Offendene. When his irritation had cooled down {{he was glad}} {{there had been no}} explosive quarrel; but he felt sure that there was a notch made against him, and that somehow or other he was intended to pay. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> to him that the immediate effect of his revelation had been to harden Grandcourt's previous determination. But as to the particular movements that made this process in his baffling mind, Lush could only toss up his chin in despair of a theory.|$|R
25|$|If {{references}} are made, the Court of Justice {{will give a}} preliminary ruling, {{in order for the}} member state court to conclude the case and award a remedy. The right to an effective remedy is a general principle of EU law, enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights article 47. Most of the time Regulations and Directives will set out the relevant remedies to be awarded, or they will be construed from the legislation according to the practices of the member state. It could also be that the government is responsible for failure to properly implement a Directive or Regulation, and must therefore pay damages. In Francovich v Italy, the Italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent, as the Insolvency Protection Directive required. Francovich, the former employee of a bankrupt Venetian firm, was therefore allowed to claim 6 million Lira from the Italian government in damages for his loss. The Court of Justice held that if a Directive would confer identifiable rights on individuals, and there is a causal link between a member state's violation of EU and a claimant's loss, damages must be paid. The fact that the incompatible law is an Act of Parliament is no defence. So, in Factortame it was irrelevant that Parliament had legislated to require a quota of British ownership of fishing vessels in primary legislation. Similarly, in was Brasserie du Pêcheur v Germany the German government was liable to a French beer company for damages from prohibiting its imports, which did not comply with the fabled beer purity law. It was not decisive that the German Parliament had not acted willfully or negligently. It was merely necessary that there was (1) a rule intended to confer rights, (2) that a breach was sufficiently serious, and (3) there was a causal link between the breach and damage. The Court of Justice advised a breach is to be regarded as 'sufficiently serious' by weighing a range of factors, such as whether it was voluntary, or persistent. In Köbler v Republik Österreich the Court of Justice added that member state liability could also flow from judges failing to adequately implement the law. On the other hand, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that EU institutions, such as the Commission, may be liable according to the same principles for failure to follow the law. The only institution whose decisions appear incapable of generating a damages claim is the Court of Justice itself.|$|E
500|$|The {{nature of}} the afterlife which the dead person enjoyed is {{difficult}} to define, because of the differing traditions within Ancient Egyptian religion. In the Book of the Dead, the dead were taken into {{the presence of the}} god Osiris, who was confined to the subterranean Duat. There are also spells to enable the ba or akh of the dead to join Ra as he travelled the sky in his sun-barque, and help him fight off Apep. As well as joining the Gods, the Book of the Dead also depicts the dead living on in the 'Field of Reeds', a paradisiac likeness of the real world. The Field of Reeds is depicted as a lush, plentiful version of the Egypt of the living. There are fields, crops, oxen, people and waterways. The deceased person is shown encountering the Great Ennead, a group of gods, as well as his or her own parents. While the depiction of the Field of Reeds is pleasant and plentiful, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that manual labour is required. For this reason burials included a number of statuettes named shabti, or later ushebti. These statuettes were inscribed with a spell, also included in the Book of the Dead, requiring them to undertake any manual labour that might be the owner's duty in the afterlife. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that the dead not only went to a place where the gods lived, but that they acquired divine characteristics themselves. In many occasions, the deceased is mentioned as [...] "The Osiris – [...] " [...] in the Book of the Dead.|$|E
500|$|A women's lodge {{existed in}} Boston {{during the last}} quarter of the eighteenth century. Hannah Mather Crocker, in an apology for Freemasonry written in 1815, claims to have presided over such a lodge, yet her description, [...] "founded on the {{original}} principles of true ancient masonry, as far as was consistent with the female character" [...] leaves the actual constitution open to question. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that St. Anne's lodge was extinct at the time of her writing about it. Crocker’s leadership of this exclusively female Masonic lodge stands as an alternative to historical frameworks that emphasize the formal political exclusion and public silencing of women in the development of republican, liberal political practice in the West.|$|E
5000|$|It {{became obvious}} that the Supreme Commander for the attack of Japan would hold an {{enormous}} amount of power and would command an invasion force larger than any seen to date in the Second World War. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that whoever this commander was would have direct command authority of not one, but several five-star officers. To that end, a proposal was discussed in the War Department to appoint Douglas MacArthur to the rank of [...] "General of the Armies" [...] and have this position be considered a six-star general rank.|$|R
60|$|He watched Mr. Silk keenly, {{but that}} gentleman went {{about his work}} in his usual quiet and gloomy fashion, and, after a day's leave {{for the purpose of}} {{arranging}} the affairs of a sick aunt in Camberwell, came back only a little less gloomy than before. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that Mr. Swann's complaisance was nearly at an end, and a letter, couched in vigorous, not to say regrettable, terms for a moribund man, expressed such a desire for fresh air and exercise that Hardy was prepared to see him at any moment.|$|R
50|$|In 1825, Kulik {{mentioned}} {{a table of}} factors up to 30 millions, but this table does no longer seem to exist. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> not <b>clear</b> if <b>it</b> had really <b>been</b> completed.|$|R
