50|$|There are {{two common}} types of {{large-scale}} pellet mills: flat die mills and ring die mills. Flat die mills use a flat <b>die</b> with slots. <b>The</b> powder is {{introduced to the}} top of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> and as <b>the</b> <b>die</b> rotates a roller presses the powder through the holes in <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> A cutter {{on the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>die</b> cuts <b>the</b> exposed pellet free from <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> In <b>the</b> ring <b>die</b> there are radial slot throughout <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> Powder is fed into the inside of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> and spreaders evenly distribute the powder. Two rollers then compress the powder through <b>the</b> <b>die</b> holes. Two cutters are used to cut the pellets free from the outside of <b>the</b> <b>die.</b>|$|R

50|$|Whatever {{process is}} {{used to make the}} {{tableting}} blend, the process of making a tablet by powder compaction is very similar. First, the powder is filled into <b>the</b> <b>die</b> from above. <b>The</b> mass of powder is determined by the position of the lower punch in <b>the</b> <b>die,</b> <b>the</b> cross-sectional area of <b>the</b> <b>die,</b> and <b>the</b> powder density. At this stage, adjustments to the tablet weight are normally made by repositioning the lower punch. After <b>die</b> filling, <b>the</b> upper punch is lowered into <b>the</b> <b>die</b> and <b>the</b> powder is uniaxially compressed to a porosity of between 5 and 20%. The compression can take place in one or two stages (main compression, and, sometimes, pre-compression or tamping) and for commercial production occurs very fast (500-50 ms per tablet). Finally, the upper punch is pulled up and out of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> (decompression), and <b>the</b> tablet is ejected from <b>the</b> <b>die</b> by lifting <b>the</b> lower punch until its upper surface is flush with the top face of <b>the</b> <b>die.</b> This process is repeated for each tablet.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Even though Extrusion {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a semi stationary process, the defor-mations of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> at <b>the</b> beginning of the process can have great influence on the process later on. During filling of <b>the</b> <b>die,</b> <b>the</b> deformation of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> depends on <b>the</b> location of the flow front {{up to a point}} where parts of the profile will be opened or closed, especially in porthole dies. In this paper we present an accurate 2 D method to simulate the filling of extrusion <b>dies.</b> <b>The</b> method is based on the pseudo concentration technique. We compare different options to model the pseudo material and choose the best. ...|$|R
