5|$|On August 3 the FBI {{announced}} that no fingerprints {{had been found}} on a guitar strap made by L.D. Cooper. One week later they added that <b>his</b> <b>DNA</b> did not match the partial DNA profile obtained from the hijacker's tie, but acknowledged, once again, {{that there is no}} certainty that the hijacker was the source of the organic material obtained from the tie. The bureau has made no further public comment.|$|E
5|$|The FBI {{eliminated}} Weber as {{an active}} suspect in July 1998 when his fingerprints did not match any of those processed in the hijacked plane, and no other direct evidence could be found to implicate him. Later, <b>his</b> <b>DNA</b> also failed to match the samples recovered from Cooper's tie, though the bureau has since conceded that they cannot be certain that the organic material on the tie came from Cooper.|$|E

The answers become even more surprising when Scully's son, baby William, is put on the line.|$|E
5|$|Betty visits Bruce in the {{hospital}} and remarks that he should be dead, but Bruce feels great. A new janitor at the lab claims that he is Bruce's biological father, of whom Bruce has no recollection. When under extreme stress, Bruce transforms into the Hulk, a huge, humanoid, green-skinned monstrous being who destroys the laboratory, though Bruce later has no memory of the incident. General Ross suspects Bruce of collaborating with David Banner but deduces Bruce has repressed memories. He orders Bruce to be put under house arrest. Through a phone call with his father, Bruce learns that the radiation unleashed something that was already in <b>his</b> <b>DNA,</b> and that David Banner plans to have Betty killed by his dogs, which now have similar powers to the Hulk thanks to David mutating them with gamma radiation. Bruce is then attacked by Major Glenn Talbot, leading to a transformation into the Hulk. The Hulk seriously injures Talbot before leaping to save Betty. After being wounded in a lengthy struggle, he kills David's dogs and changes back into Bruce before being captured by the military the next morning.|$|E

5|$|Captain John Hart appears {{through the}} Cardiff space-time Rift using a vortex {{manipulator}} and asks Jack Harkness {{for help in}} locating three radioactive cluster bombs, apparently scattered across Cardiff. Jack Harkness tells his team that John cannot be trusted but agrees to help him. True to Jack's word, Captain John is lying and seizes the containers, trying to kill Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) using a paralyzing lip gloss, shooting Owen Harper (Burn Gorman), punching Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) and pushing Jack {{off the top of}} a building, thinking he's dead. However the containers, which are supposed to contain the location of a valuable diamond hidden by the lover he murdered, instead contain an explosive which latches on the DNA signature of her killer. As insurance against Torchwood leaving him to die, John handcuffs himself to Gwen and swallows the key. After superficially altering <b>his</b> <b>DNA</b> using that of the Torchwood staff, Jack and Owen are able to save John's life before banishing him.

He also appears in the spin-off Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring, which takes place 15 years after the main story, {{but he has a}} younger appearance, much to the confusion of the main characters. In the manga sequel , Orochimaru creates an artificial human based on <b>his</b> <b>DNA,</b> whom he names Mitsuki, and refers to him as his son.

50|$|By {{the third}} trial, the {{backbone}} of the defense's case was the evidence of police and prosecutorial misconduct in the case. The defense argued that the investigation was riddled by critical mistakes, both in the collection of evidence and the investigation of Boney as a suspect. The sweatshirt found at the crime scene revealed Charles Boney's <b>DNA,</b> <b>his</b> girlfriend's <b>DNA,</b> <b>his</b> prison nickname, and his department of corrections number. Kim Camm's shoes were also lined up {{on the top of the}} vehicle; Boney has a long history of fetish driven assaults that included the theft of shoes. It is unclear how the investigative team missed these pieces of evidence during the initial investigation. The defense team was told that the evidence had been thoroughly investigated.|$|R

5|$|The suspect (later {{identified}} as David Lace) was discovered when {{the profile of}} the killer showed a partial match on the national database, which belonged to a sibling of a previous suspect. A further sample was taken from another sibling, who was not on the database, to help confirm the match via a process called familial searching. At first the police refused to release the identity of the new prime suspect, except to reveal that he had committed suicide in 1988, and had confessed to DeSimone's murder while in custody for an unrelated crime in 1983, 18 months after Hodgson's conviction. His body was exhumed at Kingston cemetery in Portsmouth on 12 August 2009 in order to compare <b>his</b> <b>DNA</b> to that found at the crime scene. Hampshire Constabulary said the breakthrough in the case was only possible because of advances in forensic science and tests on the body would take six weeks, after which a file on the dead suspect could then be submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service. Visitors to the cemetery in Portsmouth said the grave of the suspect had no headstone and was untended. Police revealed that the suspect's confession was one of seven which had been made since Hodgson's conviction.|$|E

25|$|Law {{enforcement}} {{missed an}} opportunity to catch Franklin because <b>his</b> <b>DNA</b> was never collected. In 2003, {{he was convicted of}} a felony and was serving three years of supervised probation. In 2004, voters passed Proposition 69, which requires that DNA must be collected from all felons and everyone arrested on some specified charges. It also requires the expansion of the DNA database. Authorities collected and sorted through thousands of DNA samples. While he was on probation, Franklin's DNA was supposed to be entered in the DNA database. In July 2005, Franklin was on unsupervised probation, but <b>his</b> <b>DNA</b> was not entered into the system. Probation officers did not collect DNA samples from people who were on unsupervised probation between November 2004 and August 2005. During that period, the probation department did not have the resources to collect samples. Officers did not collect samples until August 2005.|$|E
