5|$|In {{multicellular}} eukaryotes, {{cells in}} different organs and tissues have different patterns of gene expression and therefore have {{different sets of}} enzymes (known as isozymes) available for metabolic reactions. This provides a mechanism for regulating the overall metabolism of the organism. For example, hexokinase, the first enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, has a specialized form called <b>glucokinase</b> expressed in the liver and pancreas that has a lower affinity for glucose yet is more sensitive to glucose concentration. This enzyme is involved in sensing blood sugar and regulating insulin production.|$|E
25|$|Insulin {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{important}} of the hormones that have direct or indirect effects on <b>glucokinase</b> expression and activity in the liver. Insulin appears to affect both <b>glucokinase</b> transcription and activity through multiple direct and indirect pathways. While rising portal vein glucose levels increase <b>glucokinase</b> activity, the concomitant rise of insulin amplifies this effect by induction of <b>glucokinase</b> synthesis. <b>Glucokinase</b> transcription begins to rise within an hour of rising insulin levels. <b>Glucokinase</b> transcription becomes nearly undetectable in prolonged starvation, severe carbohydrate deprivation, or untreated insulin-deficient diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Most of the <b>glucokinase</b> in a mammal {{is found}} in the liver, and <b>glucokinase</b> {{provides}} approximately 95% of the hexokinase activity in hepatocytes.

For the simulation of biological networks, missing enzymatic kinetic para-meters can be calculated using a similarity analysis of the enzymes’ molecular interaction fields. The quantitative PIPSA (qPIPSA) meth-odology relates changes in the molecular interaction fields of the enzymes with variations in the enzymatic rate constants or binding affinities. As an illustrative example, this approach is used to predict kinetic parameters for <b>glucokinases</b> from Escherichia coli based on experimental values for a test set of enzymes. The best correlation of the electrostatic potentials with kinetic parameters is found for the open form of the <b>glucokinases.</b> The similarity analysis was extended to a large set of <b>glucokinases</b> from various organisms...|$|R

40|$|Four {{forms of}} hexose kinase {{activity}} from developing maize (Zea mays L.) kernels have been separated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration chromatography, blue-agarose chromatography, and ion exchange chromatography. Two of these hexose kinases utilized d-glucose most effectively and {{are classified as}} <b>glucokinases</b> (EC 2. 7. 1. 2). The other two hexose kinases utilized only d-fructose and are classified as fructokinases (EC 2. 7. 1. 4). All hexose kinases analyzed had broad pH optima between 7. 5 and 9. 5 with optimal activity at pH 8. 5. The two <b>glucokinases</b> differed in substrate affinities. One form had low Km values [Km(glucose) = 117 micromolar, Km(ATP) = 66 micromolar] whereas the other form had much higher Km values [Km(glucose) = 750 micromolar, Km(ATP) = 182 micromolar]. Both fructokinases had similar substrate saturation responses. The Km(fructose) was about 130 micromolar and the Km(ATP) was about 700 micromolar. Both exhibited uncompetitive substrate inhibition by fructose [Ki(fructose) = 1. 40 to 2. 00 millimolar]. ADP inhibited all four hexose kinase activities, whereas sugar phosphates {{had little effect on}} their activities. The data suggest that substrate concentrations are an important factor controlling hexose kinase activity in situ...|$|R

25|$|<b>Glucokinase</b> {{has been}} found in the brain in largely the same areas that contain glucose-sensing neurons, {{including}} both of the hypothalamic nuclei. Inhibition of <b>glucokinase</b> abolishes the ventromedial nucleus response to a meal. However, brain glucose levels are lower than plasma levels, typically 0.5–3.5mmol/L. Although this range is matches the sensitivity of the glucose-sensing neurons, it is below the optimal inflection sensitivity for <b>glucokinase.</b> The presumption, based on indirect evidence and speculation, is that neuronal <b>glucokinase</b> is somehow exposed to plasma glucose levels even in the neurons.|$|E

30|$|Fructose-specific uptake in fungi is not common, but {{has been}} {{observed}} in Neurospora crassa when the mycelium was subjected to carbon starvation (Rand and Tatum 1980). Hexose uptake by filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus nidulans (Wei et al. 2004) usually occurs with higher affinity to glucose than to fructose. Within the cells, fructose and glucose are phosphorylated by hexokinases (ATP:d-hexose 6 -phosphotransferase EC 2.7. 1.1) and <b>glucokinases</b> (ATP:d-glucose 6 -phosphotransferase EC 2.7. 1.2), and the phosphorylated sugars are interconverted to each other by hexose- 6 -phosphate isomerase.

25|$|Although {{most of the}} <b>glucokinase</b> in {{the body}} is in the liver, smaller amounts in the beta and alpha cells of the pancreas, certain {{hypothalamic}} neurons, and specific cells (enterocytes) of the gut play an increasingly appreciated role in regulation of carbohydrate metabolism.

The kinetic properties of the three GLKs such as Km, Vmax, optimal pH, and temperature were characterized, demonstrating that these enzymes performed the specific functions against varied substrates and under different temperatures. The abundance of ATP-GLK was attenuated when culture temperature was elevated and was almost undetectable at 80 °C, whereas the ADP-GLK abundance was insensitive to temperature changes. Using degradation assays, ATP-GLK {{was found to have}} significantly faster degradation than ADP-GLK at 80 °C. Co-immunoprecipitation results revealed that heat shock protein 60 (HSP 60) could interact with ATP-GLK and ADP-GLK at 60 and 75 °C, whereas at 80 °C, the interaction was only effectively with ADP-GLK but not ATP-GLK.

40|$|Although ATP is {{the most}} common {{phosphoryl}} group donor for kinases, some kinases from certain hyperthermophilic archaea such as Pyrococcus horikoshii and Thermococcus litoralis use ADP as the phosphoryl donor. Those are ADP-dependent <b>glucokinases</b> (ADPGK) and phosphofructokinases in their glycolytic pathway. Here, we succeeded in gene cloning the ADPGK from P. horikoshii OT 3 (phGK) in Escherichia coli,and in easy preparation of the enzyme, crystallization, and the structure determination of the apo enzyme. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the ADPGK from T. litoralis (tlGK) in a complex with ADP was reported. The overall structure of two homologous enzymes (56. 7 %) was basically similar: This means that they consisted of large α/β-domains and small domains. However, a marked adjustment of the two domains, which is a 10 -Å translation and a 20 ° rotation from the conserved GG sequence located {{at the center of the}} hinge, was observed between the apo-phGK and ADP-tlGK structures.

5000|$|Based on {{the high}} {{concentration}} of phosphate in the Earth's crust, the universal metabolism of pyrophosphate and polyP in modern cells, the ability to form phosphates abiotically, and its simplicity compared to nucleotides and nucleic acids, replication probably began on phosphate-rich mineral surfaces and involved phosphate related enzymes. Replicases are necessary for the genetic code to have existed, so Cavalier-Smith argues that [...] "polyP kinases and pyrophosphate kinases may {{have been among the}} earliest protein-coded catalysts." [...] If these did exist, then polyP-binding proteins would have been the most useful source of energy for the obcells. Due to its anionic properties, it is quite plausible that while immersed in the nucleotide and nucleic acid rich environment, polyP-binding proteins could have polymerized with these substances. Therefore, obcells with exonucleases attached to their membrane would have had an advantage for replication compared to those that did not. In modern cells, <b>glucokinases</b> typically have two different phosphate-binding domains, mainly containing the amino acids glycine, threonine, and aspartate. Therefore, Cavalier-Smith proposes that these shared domains could have originated in obcells to bind to pyrophosphate.|$|R

40|$|Polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) belong {{mostly to}} Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria and are quite divergent. Under aerobic conditions, they {{accumulate}} intracellular polyphosphate (polyP), while they typically synthesize polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) under anaerobic conditions. Many ecological, physiological, and genomic analyses {{have been performed}} with proteobacterial PAOs, but few with actino-bacterial PAOs. In this study, the whole genome sequence of an actinobacterial PAO, Microlunatus phos-phovorus NM- 1 T (NBRC 101784 T), was determined. The number of genes for polyP metabolism was greater in M. phosphovorus than in other actinobacteria; it possesses genes for four polyP kinases (ppks), two polyP-dependent <b>glucokinases</b> (ppgks), and three phosphate transporters (pits). In contrast, it harbours only a single ppx gene for exopolyphosphatase, although two copies of ppx are generally present in other actinobacteria. Furthermore, M. phosphovorus lacks the phaABC genes for PHA synthesis and the actP gene encoding an acetate/H 1 symporter, both of which play crucial roles in anaerobic PHA accumulation in proteobacterial PAOs. Thus, while the general features of M. phosphovorus regarding aerobic polyP accumulation {{are similar to those}} of proteobacterial PAOs, its anaerobic polyP use and PHA synthesis appear to be different.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIIn some archaea, glucose {{degradation}} proceeds {{through a}} modified version of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway where glucose and fructose- 6 -P phosphorylation is carried out by kinases that use ADP as the phosphoryl donor. Unlike their ATP-dependent counterparts these enzymes have been reported as non-regulated. Based on the three dimensional structure determination of several ADP-dependent kinases they can be classified as members of the ribokinase superfamily. In this work, we have studied the role of divalent metal cations on the catalysis and regulation of ADP-dependent <b>glucokinases</b> and phosphofructokinase from hyperthermophilic archaea by means of initial velocity assays as well as molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that a divalent cation is strictly necessary for the activity of these enzymes and they strongly suggest that the true substrate is the metal-nucleotide complex. Also, these enzymes are promiscuous in relation to their metal usage where the only considerations for metal assisted catalysis seem to be related to the ionic radii and coordination geometry of the cations. Molecular dynamics simulations strongly suggest that this metal is bound to the highly conserved NXXE motif, which constitutes one of the signatures of the ribokinase superfamily. Although free ADP cannot act as a phosphoryl donor it still can bind to these enzymes with a reduced affinity, stressing the importance of the metal in the proper binding of the nucleotide at the active site. Also, data show that the binding of a second metal to these enzymes produces a complex with a reduced catalytic constant. On the basis of these findings and considering evolutionary information for the ribokinase superfamily, we propose that the regulatory metal acts by modulating the energy difference between the proteinsubstrates complex and the reaction transition state, which could constitute a general mechanism for the metal regulation of the enzymes that belong this superfamily.
