5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} is rare, with {{an estimated}} 3-4 cases per million annual <b>incidence</b> in adults. While it may occur in all age groups, it is most common in the third decade. 75% are female. Given that older studies show no difference in <b>incidence</b> between men and women, {{it has been suggested}} that the use of oral contraceptives in women is behind the disparity between the sexes. A 1995 report from Saudi Arabia found a doubled <b>incidence</b> at 7 cases per 100,000; this was attributed to the fact that Behçet's disease, which increases risk of CVST, is more common in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Despite these differences, {{the leading}} causes {{of death in the}} United States are remarkably similar for men and women, headed by heart disease, which {{accounts}} for a quarter of all deaths, followed by cancer, lung disease and stroke. While women have a lower <b>incidence</b> of death from unintentional injury (see below) and suicide, they have a higher <b>incidence</b> of dementia (Gronowski and Schindler, Table I).|$|E
40|$|Rising human {{population}} and the associated demand for more land, water and other natural resources are intensifying conflicts between people and wildlife worldwide. We investigated the nature, intensity, seasonality, spatial and temporal patterns in human–hippo conflict <b>incidences</b> reported from wildlife stations Kenya-wide over a 12 -year period spanning 1997 – 2008. Overall, 4493 human–hippo conflict <b>incidences</b> were recorded, representing a mean rate of 4. 46 ± 0. 29 <b>incidences</b> per month. The conflict <b>incidences</b> increased by 1285 % from 1997 to 2008, resulting in 937 peak <b>incidences</b> reported in 2008. Number of conflict <b>incidences</b> differed among conservation regions, with <b>incidences</b> increasing during severe droughts and over time. Crop damage was the most commonly reported type of conflict. Wildlife managers attended to 90 % of all reported conflict <b>incidences.</b> Hippo mortality increased linearly with increasing conflict <b>incidences,</b> portending a precarious future for hippos outside protected areas of Kenya.

40|$|Objective of the {{research}} was to study the frequency of stenosing laryngotracheitis (LT) and recurrent stenosing laryngotracheitis (RLT) <b>incidences</b> in children depending on ambient air pollutants concentration. Methods. The concentrations of suspended sediments, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen fluoride, ammonia, and formaldehyde in Vinnytsia within 1508 days (2000 – 2004) have been analyzed. All medical emergency calls caused by LT diagnosis (1 – 3 episodes of the disease) and RLT diagnosis (4 and > episodes of the disease) in children aged 0 – 14 years have been studied. Results. It has been established that a level of the atmospheric air pollution in Vinnytsia had been consistently high mainly due to formaldehyde, hydrogen fluoride and suspended sediments. The 1178 <b>incidences</b> of LT and 72 <b>incidences</b> of RLT were registered. The number of daily <b>incidences</b> of LT and RLT ranged from 0 to 6 and from 0 to 2, respectively. The average daily concentrations and daily 20 -minute maximum concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and hydrogen fluoride in air were higher on days with LT <b>incidences</b> than on days without LT <b>incidences.</b> The average concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and hydrogen fluoride during the observation period exceeded the maximum permissible average daily concentrations. The average of 20 -minute maximum of nitrogen dioxide and hydrogen fluoride concentrations during the observation period did not exceed the maximum permissible single exposure concentrations. Direct weak correlations have been revealed between LT <b>incidences</b> in children and daily average concentrations and 20 -minute maximum concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and hydrogen fluoride in air. It hasn’t been revealed correlations between LT <b>incidences</b> and ambient air pollution by suspended sediments, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, ammonia and formaldehyde. There {{were no significant differences}} in average concentrations and 20 -minute maximum concentrations of air pollutants between days with RLT <b>incidences</b> and days without RLT <b>incidences.</b> Conclusions. The correlations between LT and ambient air pollution by nitrogen dioxide and hydrogen fluoride have been established. No correlation between RLT and air pollutants has been revealed. ...|$|R
5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of bupropion. A high <b>incidence</b> of seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a seizure <b>incidence</b> of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure <b>incidence</b> of 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the <b>incidence</b> climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600mg per day. For comparison, the <b>incidence</b> of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels. Clinical depression itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not actually increase seizure risk at all. However, this study also found that bupropion and clomipramine were unique among antidepressants in that they were associated with increased <b>incidence</b> of seizures.|$|E

5|$|Rupture of the trachea or {{bronchus}} is {{the most}} common type of blunt injury to the airway. It is difficult to determine the <b>incidence</b> of TBI: in as many as 30–80% of cases, death occurs before the person reaches a hospital, and these people may not be included in studies. On the other hand, some TBI are so small that they do not cause significant symptoms and are therefore never noticed. In addition, the injury sometimes is not associated with symptoms until complications develop later, further hindering estimation of the true <b>incidence.</b> However, autopsy studies have revealed TBI in 2.5–3.2% of people who died after trauma. Of all neck and chest traumas, including people that died immediately, TBI is estimated to occur in 0.5–2%. An estimated 0.5% of polytrauma patients treated in trauma centers have TBI. The <b>incidence</b> is estimated at 2% in blunt chest and neck trauma and 1–2% in penetrating chest trauma. Laryngotracheal injuries occur in 8% of patients with penetrating injury to the neck, and TBI occurs in 2.8% of blunt chest trauma deaths. In people with blunt trauma who do reach a hospital alive, reports have found incidences of 2.1% and 5.3%. Another study of blunt chest trauma revealed an <b>incidence</b> of only 0.3%, but a mortality rate of 67% (possibly due in part to associated injuries). The <b>incidence</b> of iatrogenic TBI (that caused by medical procedures) is rising, and the risk may be higher for women and the elderly. TBI results about once every 20,000 times someone is intubated through the mouth, but when intubation is performed emergently, the <b>incidence</b> may be as high as 15%.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to analyse the extent to which provisions for students to be physically active during breaks within the school day, correlate positively with decreases in negative behavioural <b>incidences</b> within both lessons and breaks periods. Seven days were spent across three different primary schools, three in schools 1 and 2 and one singular day in school 3. These schools were selected via recommendation from the researchers tutor. During all three visits, notes were taken during both lessons and break periods, tallying the amount of behavioural <b>incidences</b> occurring and also noting on what was else was happening. Furthermore interviews with the head, a classroom teacher and two year 6 students were conducted within each other the three schools. An average of 6. 9 behavioural <b>incidences</b> occurred across the 7 days spent within the three primary schools. There was {{a significant difference between the}} amount of behavioural <b>incidences</b> observed during lessons within the visit in school 2 (2. 9 ± 1. 8), and that of school 1 (9. 9 ± 4. 3) and school 3 (10 ± 4) (see table 3). The period of the day that proved, across all three schools, to be the most vulnerable to behavioural <b>incidences</b> were lessons between break and lunch time (8. 7 ± 6. 4). At the other end of the spectrum the period of the day where the least amount of behavioural <b>incidences</b> occurred, was lessons between lunch time and the end of the day (5. 3 ± 3. 6) (see table 2). With regards breaks in the school day, over the 7 days of visits across 14 separate break periods an average of 2. 4 behavioural <b>incidences</b> were noted upon. School 2 once again, was found to have the lowest amount of behavioural <b>incidences</b> during break periods (0. 2 ± 0. 4) (see table 9).

In this study, we analyzed time-series Terra / Aqua MODIS satellite hotspot products from 2001 to 2013 to derive intra- and inter-annual trends in fire <b>incidences</b> in Nagaland state, located in the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. Time-series regression was applied to MODIS fire products at variable spatial scales in GIS. Significance of change in fire frequency at each grid level was tested using t statistic. Spatial clustering of higher or lower fire <b>incidences</b> across study area was determined using Getis-OrdGi statistic. Maximum fire <b>incidences</b> were encountered in moist mixed deciduous forests (46 %) followed by secondary moist bamboo brakes (30 %). In most parts of the study area fire <b>incidences</b> peaked during March while in warmer parts (e. g.

The subclinical mastitis <b>incidences</b> were found to be higher than the clinical <b>incidences</b> of mastitis both during summer and winter. The highest subclinical <b>incidences</b> were observed in the left forequarters and the lower <b>incidences</b> were found in the left hind quarters. However the clinical <b>incidences</b> of the disease, revealed an opposite occurrence. Most of these <b>incidences</b> were due to Staphylococcus aureus (23. 56 %), followed by S. epidermidis (14. 37 %), Actinomyces pyogenes (9. 77 %), Escherichia coli (6. 32 %), Acinetobacter antratus (7. 47 %), Bacillus cereus (6. 86 %) and Bacillus subtilis (4. 59 %). Moreover it is clear that S. epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus spp. were isolated only during winter, while Klebsiella aerogenes, E. coli, A. pyogenes and yeast were found during summer survey only. The <b>incidences</b> of the isolated organisms were compared within the different quarters according to their location and their California Mastitis Test (CMT), during summer and winter.
