Currently, New Zealand’s meat producing companies measure meat quality attributes by using a different technology for every trait, with no overarching way to combine them, with many of the technologies requiring collection and destruction of the product. There is a desire by the meat industry to find a single way to measure and compare meat quality parameters in a single process or technology. The development of an in-line (within the normal production line of an abattoir or meat processor), real time, non-destructive quality control system could help define multiple meat traits in a way that can guarantee the product in terms of composition, safety and consistency. These guarantees not only help the producer to ask a higher premium for their product, but also give assurances to the consumer that they are getting exactly what they are expecting and paying for. This thesis focussed on determining whether the spectral imaging technologies of near infrared and hyperspectral imaging, and relevant pre-processing and modelling techniques were suitable for use in an in-plant situation for the prediction of lamb meat quality attributes. Data was collected on 2511 lambs from 10 separate kills. The lambs were slaughtered through three abattoirs owned by Alliance Group Limited with near infrared and hyperspectral imaging of intact M. Longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle surface collected at 24 hours post-mortem. Traditional meat quality measurements were also collected; tenderness using a MIRINZ tenderometer, CIELab colour using a CR- 400 colour meter, ultimate pH using an Eutech Cyberscan pH 300 meter, marbling using subjective scoring by trained personnel and intramuscular fat content using gas chromatography – flame ionisation detector. The resulting data were split and used to generate calibration and validation data sets. The calibration data was used together with the spectral data that was processed using a variety of chemometric techniques including partial least squares, variable selection and neural networks to generate predictive models. The accuracy of the predictive models was then tested using the validation data set. 6 This work found that not all meat quality traits were able to be predicted accurately and certain techniques worked better for differing traits. The best predictive models for ultimate pH using the near infrared and hyperspectral data achieved R 2 values (a measure of goodness of fit) from the validation data sets of 0. 63 and 0. 48 respectively. For near infrared the best predictive models were achieved using partial least squares with pre-processing (standard normal variate, orthogonal signal correction and mean centring) applied, while for hyperspectral imaging neural networks provided the best model using a decay of 0. 00004 and a node size of 2. The best predictive models for intramuscular fat using the near infrared and hyperspectral data achieved R 2 values from the validation data sets of 0. 56 and 0. 75 respectively. For near infrared this was achieved using partial least squares with pre-processing (normalisation, multiplicative scatter correction and mean centring) applied, while for hyperspectral imaging neural networks provided the best model using a decay of 0. 0009 and a node size of 4. This performance of these two traits in particular, shows that that the prediction abilities are of a quality that future work on implementing these into an in-line system at a pilot scale should be considered. Overall, the use of novel modelling techniques such as neural networks showed potential to increase the predictive abilities of the resulting models, over more traditional modelling techniques. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the number of predictors needed to create a calibration model could be reduced, increasing the speed of analysis with only minimal loss in the accuracy of the resulting model. Results obtained during this study suggest that the calibration models are not abattoir dependent and the transfer of one calibration model to multiple abattoirs could decrease the costs and allow for faster development and implementation of an in-line, <b>in-plant</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

So the prime aim of this work was to determine the thermodynamic changes in the polypropylene (PP) mixtures depending on the percentage amount of different origin recyclates for sustainable nanocomposites. In this study, different polypropylene mixtures with the addition of PP recyclates from a selective waste collection <b>system</b> and <b>in-plant</b> recycling <b>system</b> have been subjected to detailed analysis. It was obvious that recyclates from technological waste were of higher quality than post-user recyclates obtained from a selective waste collection system. The influence of the source of the recyclates on the different properties of the processed materials has been studied in detail. The content of the repeatedly processed material in the technological recyclates was found to explain the unexpected influence of the recyclates content on the properties of the final product. A mathematical model was also formulated to calculate the content of the material with certain amount of recirculations in the <b>in-plant</b> recycling <b>system</b> since no analyses concerning the content of the repeatedly processed material in the technological recyclates added to the original material were found in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Selecting {{the best}} way to run large <b>in-plant</b> {{cogeneration}} <b>systems</b> to meet site electricity and steam demands at minimum cost is a highly complex problem. With typical annual fuel bills of several tens of millions of dollars, even small percentage changes in operating efficiency can have a large cost effect. An advisory system which incorporates a detailed power plant simulation model and a mathematical optimization package can determine the optimum settings for control variables of the power plant and eliminate uncertainties associated with achieving the minimum cost operation. TENSA Services and their parent company, ICI PLC, have developed and applied systems to achieve these optimization objectives. Both on-line and off-line systems have been installed. These systems can solve the optimization problem quickly and in real time, yielding operating costs savings of two to six percent with short paybacks. An overview of these systems is presented. Their application is illustrated by a case study...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the two {{materials}} feeding principles of “kitting” and “continuous supply” within in-plant materials supply in mass customised assembly. With the principle of kitting, parts are delivered and presented to the assembly operations in pre-sorted kits, with each kit containing parts for one assembly object. With the principle of continuous supply, a number of parts of each part number are presented at the assembly station where they are to assembled, which means that when continuous supply is used in a mixed-model assembly context, where different assembly objects require different parts, the assembler at each assembly station needs to pick the right parts to assemble on each assembly object. Depending on whether kitting or continuous supply is used, the performance of both in-plant materials supply and assembly can be affected. However, within industry, there is considerable confusion regarding which materials feeding principle should be used when. Moreover, the existing research literature on the topic is far from exhaustive. This thesis aims to provide knowledge of how the configuration and {{the context of the}} <b>in-plant</b> materials supply <b>system</b> should be considered when a choice between kitting and continuous supply is made. The research has been conducted mainly in the form of case studies at assembly plants within the Swedish automotive industry. Complementing the case studies, one experiment has been conducted. In several of the studies, it has been possible to study both kitting and continuous supply in the same setting, which has resulted in an excellent basis for comparison between the two materials feeding principles. The other studies have instead focused on aspects within each of the two materials feeding principles, enabling an understanding of how each of the two materials feeding principles can be applied and of how this can affect performance. The thesis provides a structured and thorough account of kitting and continuous supply and the effects of using these principles, depending on the configuration and the context of the <b>in-plant</b> materials supply <b>system.</b> This has previously been lacking. The structured and thorough account presented in the thesis contributes {{to an understanding of the}} benefits and drawbacks of kitting and continuous supply and the applicability of each of the materials feeding principles. The thesis further relates the choice between kitting and continuous supply to the design of an <b>in-plant</b> materials supply <b>system</b> as a whole and suggests an outline of such a design process...|$|R
40|$|Using two servohydraulic actuators, each {{capable of}} {{generating}} 40 tons of force, high-level simulated seismic tests {{were performed on}} an <b>in-plant</b> piping <b>system.</b> The purpose of these experiments was to study the behavior of piping subjected to seismic excitation levels that exceed design levels manyfold and may result in failure/plastification of pipe supports and pipe elements, and to establish seismic margins for piping and pipe supports. The performance of six different dynamic pipe support systems was evaluated and the response, operability, and fragility of dynamic supports and of a typical U. S. gate valve were investigated. Data obtained in the tests are used to validate analysis methods. Preliminary evaluations of the test results lead to the observation that, in general, failures of dynamic supports (in particular snubbers) occur only at load levels that substantially exceed the design capacity. Pipe strains at load levels exceeding the design level threefold are quite small, an d even when exceeding the design level eightfold are quite tolerable. Hence, under seismic loading, even at extreme levels {{and in spite of}} multiple support failures, pipe failure is unlikely. Comparisons of linear pretest calculations with experimental data indicate that computed results may be nonconservative, underpredicting, in particular, peak dynamic-support forces...|$|R

40|$|Vocational {{training}} system for skilled workforce has been highlighted as one ofthe key driving forces of South Korea's economic development. South Korea {{is well known}} for adopting a government-led vocational training strategy to make sure the supply of a skilled workforce according to the 1 st [...] 7 th five-year economic developmentplans. This paper examines the main features and developmental changes of this strategy from the 1960 s to the 1990 s and suggests a set of important lessons for the design and implementation of vocational training policies. Vocational training policy also was led by the government and complemented by private sector. By providing training program through the establishment of public training institutes, the government managed the supply of skills. While the government has consistently expanded and controlled the vocational {{training system}} for meeting the needs of industry, the principle system was the compulsory <b>in-plant</b> training <b>system,</b> in which itwas obligatory for large companies to provide training program for their workforce or alternatively contribute the training promotion fund. The initial stages of this system in the 1970 s were considered as successful in terms of raising numbers of trainees withinindustry. However the numbers later fell dramatically in the 1980 s after the government reformed its policy. Many employers resisted against the burden of training obligation and levy. Although there were still unsolved limitations of the government-led vocational training system, South Korean vocational training system before the 1997 IMF economic crisis has contributed systematically to the transformation of industry and to economic development...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the supply of}} components to assembly in production sys- tems, and introduces materials exposure as the interface between materials sup- ply systems and assembly systems. The purpose of the thesis is to explain how materials exposure influences the performance of materials supply systems and assembly systems. The supply of components is crucial for assembly, for in serving the requirements from assembly. Still, the materials supply system has to remain efficient. In this way, materials exposure impacts {{the performance of a}} production system as a whole. The thesis is a based on five studies, all of which depart from theoretical frame- works developed from literature and empirically applied within the Swedish automotive industry. Four case studies and one experiment were conducted to answer three research questions, and the results are published in five papers. The results of the thesis provide several theoretical and practical contributions. Both the position of the exposure {{and the size of the}} packaging for a component impact the performance of the assembly workstation performance in terms of space required, non-value-adding work, and ergonomics. Materials exposure impacts manual picking time at assembly lines, for which packaging is the most influential factor, followed by angle of exposure and height of the exposed com- ponent. Materials exposure further impacts the configuration of the in-plant ma- terials supply system by requiring additional activities in the <b>in-plant</b> materials supply <b>system,</b> which impacts its performance. Concerning the impact of choice of packaging used in materials exposure, a model to evaluate the impact a pack- aging has on the performance of the materials supply system was developed. The Materials Flow Mapping methodology is another contribution that describes the activities in materials supply systems, as well as categorises the activities in material flows into materials handling, transportation, storage, and administra- tive activities. This thesis explains how the materials exposure influences the performance of materials supply systems and assembly systems. It shows how materials expo- sure impacts the assembly system performance and the <b>in-plant</b> materials supply <b>system</b> performance, and finally, how the packaging for materials exposure im- pacts the performance of the materials supply systems and assembly systems. The thesis can further be used as a guide for how materials should be exposed and in the selection of packaging for materials exposure. The most beneficial managerial use would be in the design and operation of assembly systems, mate- rials supply systems, and in particular, materials exposure...|$|R
