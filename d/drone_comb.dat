In transition zones between the larger cells of <b>drone</b> <b>comb</b> and the smaller cells of worker comb, or when the bees encounter obstacles, the shapes are often distorted. Cells are also angled up about 13° from horizontal to prevent honey from dripping out.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Honey bee colonies furnish {{their nests}} with {{two types of}} comb {{distinguished}} by cell size: large cells for rearing males (<b>drone</b> <b>comb)</b> and small cells for rearing workers (worker comb). The bees actively reg-ulate the relative quantity of each type, a behavior likely {{to be important in}} setting a colony’s sex ratio. Experi-mental analysis of the information pathways and control mechanisms responsible for this regulation found the following results. The amount of <b>drone</b> <b>comb</b> in a nest is governed by negative feedback from <b>drone</b> <b>comb</b> already constructed. This feedback depends on the workers having direct contact with the <b>drone</b> <b>comb</b> in their nest, but does not depend on the queen’s contact with the comb. The comb itself, rather than the brood within it, is sucient to provide the negative feedback, although the brood may also contribute to the eect. These findings show that <b>drone</b> <b>comb</b> regulation does not depend on the queen acting as a centralized information gatherer and behavioral controller. Instead, the evidence points to a decision-making process distributed across the population of worker bees, a control architecture typical of colony organization in honey bees and other large-colony insect societies.

40|$|The classic view of {{an insect}} colony as a {{harmonic}} society has been challenged in the last decades. It became clear that several conflicts ‘loom’ below the peaceful surface. One conflict is about male parentage, as some workers are capable of producing viable male eggs and are in some cases favoured by selection to do so. Yet, there are methods in place to reduce or solve these conflicts. Worker policing in social Hymenoptera (by removal of worker laid eggs) was predicted in 19841 and first reported in the honeybee (Apis mellifera) in 19892. To date, worker policing has been observed in 29 species 3. Various models try to explain the origin and maintenance of policing in terms of inclusive fitness theory. Much effort has been invested into the search for signals or cues of egg provenance 4. Less {{is known about the}} organization of policing within a colony. Recent studies in several taxa suggest a specialization in policing behaviour 5. We aim to provide the first insight on the task allocation of worker policing in honeybees. Therefore, we will follow cohorts of individually marked bees of known age in an observation hive, using focal sampling methods, to study the work profile of policing honeybee workers. A predisposition for policing might be indicated by inspecting cells, especially on <b>drone</b> <b>combs.</b> By introducing worker laid eggs in drone cells, {{we will be able to}} observe actual events of policing. Policing and non-policing bees of the same age will be sampled and their ovaries dissected. The policing of bees with developed ovaries could be interpreted as selfish if they thereby would gain higher chances to lay eggs themselves. A possibly inherited bias for policing will be detected by microsatellite analysis of patrilines. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSo far, {{external}} parasites of Apis mellifera (A. externus, A. dorsalis, A. vagans) bees {{have been}} identified in many countries in Europe, but the level of infestation was not considered dangerous. In Romania cases of infestation with the three mentioned species were not identified in Apis mellifera, but their presence has been reported in some neighbor countries. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to report a possible infestation with A. externus and A. dorsalis or A. vagans in Romania. The study was conducted on a total of 35 apiaries within 4 counties in Southern Romania, on samples of bees, drones and portions of honeycomb with/without brood. A single case of infestation was incidentally identified by microscopic investigation on samples of <b>drone</b> brood <b>combs.</b> Morphological aspects of the parasite investigated microscopically suspects the presence of an external mite with characteristics of Acarapis species. The results of our investigations show that infestation with Acarapis (A. externus and A. dorsalis or A. vagans) does not constitute a threat to the Apis mellifera Carpathica, but draws attention to their presence in the apiary in thesouth of the country...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis review {{considers}} how a {{honey bee}} colony optimally controls {{the timing and}} type of new comb construction. Optimal timing requires bees to balance the energy costs of construction with the opportunity costs of lacking storage space during nectar flows. They do so by conditioning the start of building on (1) the attainment of a fullness threshold, and (2) the availability of nectar. A dynamic optimization model has suggested that this rule is slightly suboptimal, but may compensate for this by its simplicity and generality. The emergence of this collective strategy from the decisions of individual bees is poorly understood, but recent experiments have {{cast doubt on the}} long-standing idea that building is triggered by increased distension of the crops of nest bees. Bees also regulate the relative amounts of drone and worker comb in their nests, with important consequences for their sex investment strategy. Regulation depends on the inhibitory effect of <b>drone</b> <b>comb</b> on further <b>drone</b> <b>comb</b> construction, mediated through a decentralized process requiring that workers have direct contact with the comb. Contact by the queen is not required, nor is the presence of drone brood, although the latter may enhance the strength of inhibition...|$|E
