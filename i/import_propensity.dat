The principal conclusions are that the export behavior of TNC affiliates is more significant than that of local firms, but this does not mean that there are important trade spillovers. The presence of TNC affiliates does not imply a greater export propensity. Between 1997 and 2000 the TNC affiliates presented a higher <b>import</b> <b>propensity</b> than local firms and there are not evidences of spillovers.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} trade propensities and foreign ownership shares in Indonesian manufacturing in 1992 and 1994. Foreign plants had relatively high trade propensities, and plants with high foreign ownership shares had the highest export <b>propensities.</b> Differences in <b>import</b> <b>propensities</b> among foreign ownership groups were relatively small. It might be argued that trade propensities determine foreign ownership shares in Indonesia, which historically waives foreign ownership restrictions for firms that export much of their output. However, this paper argues that causation runs from foreign ownership shares to trade propensities, because multinational firms have strong incentives to restrict access by uncontrolled affiliates to their international marketing networks, and because the relationship persists even when the effects of policy distortions are accounted for. Correspondingly, ownership restrictions that discriminate among foreign ownership groups are likely to reduce the exports of foreign multinational affiliates, but to have a much weaker effect on imports. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of buyer-supplier {{relationships}} within business group on capital goods trade in the context of foreign direct investment by buyer firms and capital goods producers. A simple model in which cost-reducing relationship specific investments are underlying business group ties suggests that 1) foreign affiliates of business group firms have a greater propensity to import capital goods from the home country, increasing Japanese exports 2) if the establishment of overseas affiliates by business groups firms attracts FDI by their capital goods suppliers, the ‘trade creating’ impact of business group ties may disappear or even be reversed. Empirical analysis of capital goods imports by 1790 manufacturing affiliates operated abroad by Japanese multinational firms in 1996 provides broad support for these predictions and demonstrates a sizeable impact of buyer-supplier ties in business groups on trade. Affiliates of member firms of horizontal and vertical business groups with supplier ties exhibit a greater propensity to import from Japan, but this impact is mitigated or transformed into a smaller <b>import</b> <b>propensity</b> if the groups’ capital goods producers have substantial manufacturing investments abroad. multinational firms; imports; capital goods; FDI; business groups;...|$|E
40|$|After a {{temporary}} halt {{the business cycle}} will resume its upward trend. Firms in manufacturing industry still have a comfortable stock of outstanding orders with little spare production capacity left. However, the effect of higher interest rates is likely to slow the expansion of activity abroad and of international trade. Price competitiveness of Austrian exports is unlikely to increase much further and the stimulus to consumption from the tax reform is going to wear off. Therefore, as in the earlier forecast, GDP growth is seen to come down gradually from an average 4 percent in 1989 to 3 percent in 1990. Because of higher stockbuilding total domestic demand will rise unabated. At current <b>import</b> <b>propensities</b> the foreign sector real balance will be marginally negative. Assuming broadly unchanged terms of trade the current account forecast yields a small deficit of AS 7 billion.

40|$|Standard Keynesian theory {{argues that}} {{in the short run}} an {{increase}} in exogenous demand (investment, government spending and exports) will always induce an increase in output. This is the multiplier. Modern day Keynesians extend the analysis to the long run by allowing for growth in the elements of exogenous demand. This introduces some new aspects, but leaves the basic theory unchanged. Harrod adopts the Keynesian short run framework as his own starting point, but argues {{that in the}} long run investment cannot be treated as exogenous. He notes that investment not only induces production through the multiplier, but also simultaneously expands capacity. On this basis he shows that investment is sustainable only if it self-consistent, and for this to hold it must follow a particular growth path which he calls the warranted path. This path can now be shown to be very stable. Thus the fundamental difference between Keynesian and Harrodian analysis of the long run turns on the treatment of investment. This gives rise to three distinct types of contrasts. First, output may or may not grow in Keynesian theory, depending on the paths of the components of exogenous demand; whereas growth is normal in Harrodian theory, because investment is only sustainable when it is growing. Second, a fall in the savings rate, or in the tax rate or <b>import</b> <b>propensity</b> will raise output in the Keynesian system without necessarily harming growth; but in the Harrodian system, these same changes would lower the long run rate of growth.

40|$|In {{the first}} six months of 1995, Austrian {{consumers}} spent Sch 622 billion, 4. 7 percent (+ 2. 4 percent in volume) more than a year earlier. This marked increase implied a fall in the private household saving ratio by about ½ percentage point, since gains in disposable income were damped by measures of fiscal retrenchment. Spending on domestic goods and services increased below the average. A jump in expenditure by Austrians abroad was caused not only by stronger demand for foreign travel, but also to a large extent by higher "direct" imports of consumer goods. These constitute welfare gains for the consumer – provided that they actually offer a price advantage – while causing public revenue losses and stronger competition in the retail trade sector. Sluggish growth of domestic spending (by Austrians and foreign tourists) and the higher <b>import</b> <b>propensity</b> both constrain the expansion of retail sales in Austria. The latter were barely higher (+ 0. 2 percent) in the first half of 1995 than a year ago. Wholesale trade, being cyclically more volatile, increased by 1. 6 percent in volume. Retail sales prices rose only modestly in the first semester (+ 0. 6 percent year-on-year), due also to the effects of EU accession. The drive for rationalization gave a boost to productivity and led (together with the failure of the "Konsum" cooperative) to a fall in employment by 0. 4 percent. Christmas shopping in 1995 is likely to be influenced by the first-time opening of stores on December 8 th, a public holiday in Austria. As nationwide empirical evidence is lacking, econometric models may yield only a rough order of magnitude for the (additional) sales potential. Thus, December sales may be boosted by between Sch 100 million and Sch 1. 5 billion (net of VAT). A reference value for the effect of December 8 th shop opening is provided by the 1991 experience when this date fell on a Sunday and therefore no shopping day was lost. Based on this experience, model calculations for December 1995 sales show a net gain of nearly Sch 1 billion ± 0. 5 billion. This estimate does not mean that on December 8 th itself sales will be in that range; rather, they will be higher and relatively lower on the surrounding days.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of the sourcing patterns of foreign-owned multinational subsidiaries in a cross-country European setting. Sourcing decisions (namely, buying locally versus internationally) represent a highly relevant theme for regional and national host economies, given the potential impact these decisions can have on indigenous industrial systems. The subject under analysis attracts considerable attention in regional economics, {{given the importance of}} multinationals 2 ̆ 019 local linkages in generating externalities and technology spillovers and in supporting industrial agglomeration. Additionally, a concern with growing import levels exists, since the globalization of supply chains is creating major competitive pressures for local suppliers, as companies explore global sourcing options. Inter-firm linkages between multinationals and host country suppliers are investigated. The paper is structured as follows: firstly, a thorough literature review on local sourcing, spillovers and regional impact of multinational enterprises is offered. Then, the paper puts forward a general framework of the factors influencing the choice between international and local sourcing, and formulates hypotheses (based on that conceptual framework), on subsidiary roles/characteristics (such as subsidiary age, whether subsidiary was established before or after host country EU integration, entry mode, subsidiary size) and country (home and host) and industry characteristics. Subsequently, an econometric analysis of the main determinants of sourcing decisions is conducted. The empirical setting is multi-country, EU-based. Data result from a large-scale survey of the main foreign-owned subsidiaries in four EU countries (Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the UK). The main contributions of the paper lie in an improved understanding of the influence of foreign-owned subsidiary strategies and economic integration in sourcing patterns, topics on which little research exists. Important conclusions are drawn on the scope to increase local sourcing through policy intervention at national and regional levels. Major findings concern the impact of subsidiary roles and economic integration on sourcing patterns. Regional and global integration are leading to a greater import-orientation among MNE subsidiaries, including high value-added Product Mandate subsidiaries which are assumed to be strongly embedded within host economies. It was found that economic integration (along with age of subsidiary) has a significant impact on sourcing patterns, meaning that subsidiaries established after their host countries 2 ̆ 019 EU accession are less embedded via sourcing; and that subsidiaries in global industries buy less locally, as well as subsidiaries located in small EU economies (that have lower supplying capabilities as the local industry is less diversified). Our results did not find a significant association of subsidiary size, home country and entry mode with the <b>import</b> <b>propensity</b> of the multinational subsidiaries surveyed. This research confirms the significant body of evidence that multinationals have seldom developed extensive input linkages with their host economy, and strengthens the conclusion of previous authors that the potential for local linkages is now significantly reduced as compared with the past. The results cast serious doubts on the effectiveness of traditional criteria for investment attraction; and confirm that stimulating local sourcing is problematic. Specific policy implications are developed relating to the attraction of inward foreign direct investment and to corporate development policies...|$|E
40|$|Entrepreneurship {{is a vital}} {{component}} of economic development through innovation, job creation and efficient allocation of resources. Hence, many governments play a proactive role in facilitating entry of new firms and nourishing an entrepreneurial culture. These objectives became more relevant in recent years since fostering entrepreneurship is viewed as the cure to the global economic slowdown. This thesis addresses an essential but neglected aspect of entrepreneurship development: the impact of capital flows {{in the form of}} FDI and foreign aid on domestic firm creation. What is common to FDI and aid is that capital, skills, technological and organizational know-how move across national boundaries, altering the balance of local resources available to prospective entrepreneurs. In Chapter 2, we exploit cross-country and cross-country-industry variation over time in FDI via M&A and entrepreneurship. Results suggest that adverse effects of FDI counterbalance positive spillovers, leaving the net impact on entrepreneurship negative—though it is economically very small—both at the aggregate and industry level. Nascent entrepreneurship is affected the most by FDI, with the size of the negative effect decreasing as new firms advance in age. In the literature, heightened competition ensuing FDI is documented as the main cause of crowding-out of domestic firms. Chapter 3 thus takes a step towards understanding factors governing the FDI-entrepreneurship nexus of which we consider industry competition (concentration) and wages. We find that FDI is positively associated with both elements in Dutch manufacturing industries, which translates into increases and reductions in entry rates, respectively. This suggests that lucrative rents in concentrated markets are accessible to both foreign and domestic firms. Findings also imply that higher industry wages attract would-be entrepreneurs into wage-employment rather than pursuing a career as a new venture owner. Once the channel effects are isolated, there is no direct relationship between FDI and Dutch firm entry. Chapter 4 considers the role of industry linkages between foreign and indigenous companies in entrepreneurship development in Turkey. We contend that increased demand of foreign firms for local inputs (backward linkages) and the availability of new goods and services introduced by foreign suppliers (forward linkages) stimulate domestic firm entry. While entrepreneurship is unresponsive to backward and horizontal linkages, industries with large forward linkages with foreign firms accommodate more new businesses. Foreign firms’ high <b>import</b> <b>propensities</b> and improvements in the competitive position of Turkish firms provide an intuitive explanation for the lack of FDI effects via backward and horizontal linkages, respectively. Foreign aid is complementary to FDI in countries where investors show little interest due to the risky economic environment. Therefore, sizable aid flows are channelled into areas deemed important for unleashing the entrepreneurial potential of the poor. Specifically, in Chapter 5, we argue that purpose-specific aid targeted at education, physical infrastructure and institutional reforms are of central concern to entrepreneurship in aid-receiving countries. Aid has a positive association with entrepreneurship but only at the aggregate level with no discernible impact of sectoral aid. This supports the idea that the fungibility of aid flows plays a role in the results...|$|R

40|$|D. Comm. (Economic and Management Sciences) The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to examine the}} dynamics of Mexico's external economic relations during the period 1968 - 1995. Since the early seventies, the workings of the international monetary system has been governed Illore by implicit rules and conventions based on sound market principles than rules as were the case under the fixed exchange rate system of Bretton Woods. These "rules of the game" dictated that if a country {{wanted to be part of}} the global village and reap the benefits thereof, such a country should adhere to market forces and administer its monetary-fiscal policy in such a way as to ensure that the delicate balance between the domestic and international economic environment is maintained. In the event of a deviation from these rules, a country, in this instance Mexico, would fmd itself in a. position where it is heavily penalised for not playing according to the rules of the game. Starting in 1976, the Mexican economy was characterised by ongoing exchange rate crises, which seemed to be a recurring phenomenon repeating itself more or less every six years. Time and again a misalignment in Mexico's monetary-fiscal policy led to a build-up of pressures and tensions in the external accounts of the country, especially the balance of payments and eventually disruption of the economic growth process and relations with the external world. The Mexican economy was time and again subject to a rapidly growing current account deficit, rising external foreign debt, a rising overall fiscal deficit fuelled by - xiii - expansionary government expenditure policies and the slavish adherence to a fixed exchange rate regime. The growing fiscal deficit was in all instances financed by either increased short-term, highly volatile portfolio capital, or a depletion of the country's gold and foreign reserve holdings. The discovery of large oil reserves in 1978 lessened the need for structural adjustment and the following of more prudent policy measures. Rising domestic inflation and the fixed exchange rate gave rise to an ongoing real appreciation of the peso, which undermined the competitiveness of the domestic economy and distorted the balance between domestic savings and consumption. The appreciation of the peso and the high <b>import</b> <b>propensity</b> of the domestic households led to sharp increases in imports and rather static export earnings. The vulnerability of the domestic economy was exacerbated by developments in the country's external environment. These exogenous shocks took the form of either a decline in the international oil-prices and/or a more hostile international financing environment characterised by higher. interest rates and stricter borrowing requirements. The combination of domestic financial tensions and negative developments in the country's external environment were often, especially in 1994, accompanied by domestic political upheavals.. Time and again the apparent unsustainable domestic and external disparities and the heavy reliance on speculative foreign funding led to a change in investor views of the future of the Mexican peso. Capital flights and continued speculation eventually led to a situation where the authorities could no longer manage to maintain the parity of the peso. The market subsequently forced a devaluation and/or depreciation of the peso. The exchange rate crises of 1976, 1982, 1986 - 87 and 1994 appear to have been the result of a monetary-fiscal policy stance in which the government played a relatively central role. The role of the government and its hold over the Bank of Mexico led to a situation where the Mexican economy was out of touch with developments in its external economic and financial environment. Interesting though, is the way in which the government, especially the Salinas administration, refused to follow a more marketoriented macroeconomic policy with reference to the exchange rate regime and monetary-fiscal policy in general. As the events that led to the collapse of the peso in - XIV - 1994 unfolded, it became evident that the overvalued peso was maintained solely for non-economic reasons. The manner in which the new Zedillo administration reacted to the sharp depreciation of the peso in 1994 and 1995 greatly influenced the further deterioration of the peso and Mexico's international position. The main {{objective of}} the international assistance provided to Mexico by the United States, the International Monetary Fun~ and other international institutions during the course of 1995 was to underpin the continued deterioration of the peso and the overall well-being of the Mexican economy. Although the Mexican authorities are bound by the conditions tied to the foreign fmancial assistance provided and are at this stage following a more market-oriented, less regulated economic policy, it remains to be seen whether the authorities will in future adhere more closely to the rules of the game of the international monetary system as embodied in the conventions dictated by the global village market...|$|E
40|$|Inward {{investment}} from foreign manufacturing firms {{has been sought}} as a remedy to regional industrial problems in the UK. Foreign manufacturing offers the prospect of industrial diversification, new jobs and incomes, and can also represent a stimulus to new ideas and practices in domestic industries. The potential for production externalities from the foreign to the domestic sector has been investigated {{in a number of}} empirical studies. The wider potential for foreign manufacturing to become a driver of regional competitive advantage is expected to be linked to a number of factors including underlying investment motives, subsidiary age and type, subsidiary size, degree of value added within the plant, type of plant/degree of autonomy, nationality of ownership, entry mode, industry sector, and the structure of the host/regional economy. An additional and inter-linked factor with the above {{is the extent to which}} foreign plants are embedded through their purchasing linkages into their respective local economies. The degree of embeddedness determines the indirect employment and output supported by foreign firm activities in regional economies, and is a general indicator of the extent to which foreign firms contribute towards regional growth. Previous research has work has highlighted the comparatively low levels of linkage that exist between inward investing sectors and local supply bases. For example, Turok (1993, 1997) demonstrated the Scottish electronics industry (including large numbers of inward investors) purchased just 12 % of material inputs in Scotland, and that (with reference to Input-Output tables for Scotland) output based multipliers for the electronics sector still revealed a poor quality of linkages into the local economy. In Northern Ireland, Crone and Roper (1999) reported that weak supply linkages between foreign and regional firms had restricted the potential of positive production externalities. In Wales, Roberts (1996) considered the backward (and forward) linkages created by foreign manufacturing sectors in the local economy using 1994 Input-Output tables for Wales. Overall, this research found that, on average, less than 17 % of non-wage spending of foreign manufacturing firms occurred in the Welsh economy (see also Gillespie, 2000). Finally, Brand, Hill and Munday (2000), explored in a regional Input-Output framework, the direct and indirect economic contribution of foreign owned and domestic manufacturing to the economies of Wales, Scotland and the West Midlands. The study demonstrated that foreign owned manufacturing in these regions purchased less locally than domestic firms. As a result in most of the industry sectors explored the output supported in other regional industries was generally greater in the domestic than in the foreign owned case. The analysis also explored how far each job created in foreign and domestically owned manufacturing contributed to regional value added. The superior productivity of the foreign sector meant that it generally contributed more per employee to regional value added than its domestic counterpart. The analysis of the impact of foreign (and in some cases domestic) manufacturing on local economies within an Input-Output framework has largely been based on cross-sectional information. The present paper attempts to develop a more dynamic perspective by considering structural changes over time. The objective of this paper is to explore the role of foreign manufacturing in changing the pattern of industry linkages in Wales and Scotland – two regions which have attracted comparatively high shares of new UK foreign inward investment. These two regions also make for a valuable comparative study with some analysts suggesting that there are important differences in the underlying quality of inward investment between the two regions (Hood, 1991). The paper uses information from the Scottish Input-Output tables 1973 and 1996 (see Fraser of Allander, 1973, and Scottish Executive, 1999), and Welsh Input-Output tables 1968 and 1996 (see Ireson and Tomkins, 1978; and Hill and Roberts, 2001) to examine the changing structure of these regional economies over time. The focus of the paper is comparing manufacturing sectors where there have been high and low levels of foreign investment. The influence of foreign manufacturing is considered in the context of changes in the export orientation, <b>import</b> <b>propensity</b> and indirect employment and output effects of selected industry sectors. The wider context of the paper is continuing concern in the UK on the more dynamic impacts of foreign manufacturing industry in improving the economic prospects for UK regions, and the validity of the ‘inward investment’ model of development. The second section of the paper reviews the development of foreign manufacturing in the Welsh and Scottish economies, and critically analyses previous research that has explored the role of the foreign sector in these regions within an Input-Output model framework. The third section examines how foreign manufacturing might be expected to impact differently from the domestic sector in terms of impact on the structure of the regional economy over time. For example, in terms of its higher productivity, and different import and export propensities. The fourth section describes the Input-Output tables that are available for Wales and Scotland, and more specifically, discusses issues of comparability of tables of different vintages. The methodology used to reconcile the industry sectors in the table is discussed. The fifth section examines the nature of structural changes in the two economies, including an analysis of local trading propensities, together with estimates of multiplier effects of selected industries characterised by high and low levels of foreign direct investment (in the period 1968 - 1996 for Wales, and 1973 - 1996 for Scotland).

40|$|The U. S. {{furniture}} {{manufacturing industry}} {{has a long}} history and developed clusters in many states. It has also played an important part in the world furniture market over decades. In this context, this thesis attempts to provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the current situation and international competitiveness of the U. S. furniture industry for the period 2000 – 2009. The general aim of this thesis is to present the background information including the strong presence of major economic entities in the global furniture industry and to analyze the U. S. furniture industry based on the economic theories of inter-industry and intra-industry trade. ^ Data in this thesis was collected from secondary data sources. Collected data indicate that the global furniture industry had kept continuous growth through 2008, when it was impacted by the global financial crisis and started the downward trend. It also indicates that the U. S. furniture industry is in decline and losing global market. Indicators of U. S. 2 ̆ 7 s furniture trade performance in terms of trade specialization index, export <b>propensity,</b> <b>import</b> penetration, and the ratio of exports to imports show that U. S. is a net-importer. This signifies a low degree of international trade competitiveness for U. S. furniture industry. The results of Balassa 2 ̆ 7 s revealed comparative advantage index and Vollrath 2 ̆ 7 s revealed competitive advantage indexes suggest that, among the furniture producing countries, U. S. does not have a comparative or competitive advantage in furniture. The standard Grubel-Lloyd index is used to examine the extent of intra-industry trade of U. S. and major world-furniture trading countries. The index is also applied to U. S. 2 ̆ 7 s bilateral intra-industry trade in furniture with its major trading countries. The results indicate that the world furniture industry {{is more likely to be}} characterized by inter-industry trade, which is based on the significance of comparative advantage and factor endowments, rather than intra-industry trade. U. S. does not have a high level of intra-industry trade due to the fact that the values of U. S. furniture imports are very much higher than exports. The extent of bilateral intra-industry trade in furniture between U. S. and its major trading partners is also small except with Canada and Japan. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid- 1980 s, trade {{liberalisation}} has encouraged {{the growth of}} Australia’s international trade. The Australian wine industry {{has been successful in}} the world wine market, achieving a significant growth in production and export sales since the 1990 s. In this context, this thesis attempts to provide a comprehensive analysis of the patterns and determinants of Australia’s international trade in wines for the period 1980 - 2004. The general aim of this thesis is to analyse the Australian wine industry based on the economic theories of inter-industry trade and intra-industry trade and to model wine export and import relationships. Indicators of Australia’s trade performance in wines in terms of trade specialisation index, export <b>propensity,</b> <b>import</b> penetration, and the ratio of exports to imports indicate that Australia has become a net-exporter and has experienced a specialisation in wine trade since 1987. This signifies a high degree of international trade competitiveness in Australia’s wines. The results of Balassa’s revealed comparative advantage index and Vollrath’s revealed competitive advantage indexes suggest that, among the wine producing countries, Australia has a comparative advantage and competitive advantage in wines. The significant year was 1987 when Australia first experienced comparative and competitive advantage. The important explanation for this turning point is Australia’s {{trade liberalisation}} policy in the mid- 1980 s. Based on econometric concepts of unit root and cointegration, the unrestricted error correction model is applied to analyse the determinants of Australia’s wine exports and imports separately in the models of export supply, export demand, and import demand. The results suggest that the relative price of wine exports and the long-run production capacity have had a positive influence on the supply of wine exports. However, Australia’s wine exports are not very responsive to changes in export price. Although the trade liberalisation shows a positive impact on the supply of wine exports, it is not statistically significant. Foreign demand for Australia’s wine exports has had a significant negative response to changes in the relative price of exports and a significant positive response to the depreciation of the Australian dollar in both the short run and long run. A low value of the price elasticity of foreign demand may reveal that Australia has some market power in relation to its exports of differentiated or unique wines to the world market. The demand for wine imports by Australia is inelastic with respect to the relative price of wine imports but more elastic to Australia’s income. The standard Grubel-Lloyd index is used to examine the extent of intra-industry trade of Australia and major world-wine trading countries. The index is also applied to Australia’s bilateral intra-industry trade in wines with its major trading countries. To measure the growth of intra-industry trade for Australia’s wines, the concept of marginal intra-industry trade is applied, together with Menon-Dixon’s approach. The results indicate that the world wine industry {{is more likely to be}} characterised by inter-industry trade which is based on the significance of comparative advantage and factor endowments rather than intra-industry trade. Australia has a relatively small intra-industry trade in wines. This is due to the fact that the values of Australia’s wine exports are very much higher than those of its imports. The extent of bilateral intra-industry trade in wines between Australia and its major trading partners is also small. However, the levels of bilateral intra-industry trade between Australia and New Zealand are relatively high. The growth of intra-industry trade in wines between Australia and most of the major wine-producing countries is due to the contributions of export growth to the growth in intra-industry trade, which imply that Australia is a net importer of wines from these countries. On the other hand, the percentage growth of intra-industry trade in wines between Australia and Germany, the U. S., the U. K., New Zealand, Canada, and Japan is due to the contributions of import growth to the growth in intra-industry trade, which imply that Australia is a net exporter of wines to these countries. The extent of Australia’s intra-industry trade with the rest of the world will be higher when the industry gains more scale economies. Contrary to the theoretical suggestions, product differentiations, degree of trade openness, and exchange rate have had negative relationships with Australia’s intra-industry trade in wines. With regard to Australia’s bilateral intra-industry trade with its nine major wine trading partners (France, Italy, Spain, Germany, the U. S., South Africa, New Zealand, the U. K. and Japan), the intensity of intra-industry trade in wines is statistically and positively related to the ratio of capital to labour, trade openness, common culture, and the regional trade arrangements. The policy implications of the analysis of the determinants of Australia’s intra-industry trade in wines are that the government policy should be oriented towards increases in the production capacity of the Australian wine industry in order to achieve higher economies of scale. In addition, the Australian government should promote regional economic integration and trade liberalisation involving wine trade between close and economically similar economies...|$|R
