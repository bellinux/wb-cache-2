Since water vapor is not conductive under normal circumstances, electric current cannot flow through the vapor layer. <b>Energy</b> <b>delivery</b> beyond the vaporization threshold can continue if sufficiently high voltage is applied (> +/-200 V) [...] to ionize vapor and convert it into a conductive plasma. Vapor and fragments of the overheated tissue are ejected, forming a crater.

2500|$|Research on Nova was {{focussed}} on {{the indirect}} drive approach, where the laser shine {{on the inside}} surface of a thin metal foil, typically made of gold, lead, or another high-z metal. When heated by the laser, the metal re-radiates this energy as diffuse x-rays, which are more efficient than UV at compressing the fuel pellet. In order to emit x-rays, the metal must be heated to very high temperatures, which uses up {{a considerable amount of}} the laser energy. So while the compression is more efficient, the overall energy delivered to the target is nevertheless much smaller. The reason for the x-ray conversion is not to improve <b>energy</b> <b>delivery,</b> but to [...] "smooth" [...] the energy profile; since the metal foil spreads out the heat somewhat, the anisotropies in the original laser are greatly reduced.|$|E

2500|$|The {{availability}} of plankton for food diminishes rapidly with depth. At 1000 metres, {{the biomass of}} plankton is typically about 1 percent of that at the surface, and at 5000 metres about 0.01 percent. Given there is no sunlight, energy enters deep water zones as organic matter. There are three main ways this happens. Firstly, organic matter can move into the zone from the continental landmass, for example, through currents that carry the matter down rivers, then plume along the continental shelf and finally spill down the continental slope. Other matter enters as particulate matter raining down from the overhead water column {{in the form of}} marine snow, or as sinking overhead plant material such as eelgrass, or as [...] "large particles" [...] such as dead fish and whales sinking to the bottom. A third way energy can arrive is through fish, such as vertically migrating mesopelagic fishes that can enter into the demersal zone as they ascend or descend. The demersal fish and invertebrates consume organic matter that does arrive, break it down and recycle it. A consequence of these <b>energy</b> <b>delivery</b> mechanisms is that the abundance of demersal fish and invertebrates gradually decrease as the distance from continental shorelines increases.|$|E

This dissertation {{analyzes the}} development of the oil and gas sector in Russia with a view to understand the role of these assets on the formation of Russian state interests and consequent policy prioritization, both at the domestic and the international level. The study identifies economic and political issues on which the influence of the oil and gas resources has been significant. The dissertation elucidates the various links between Russian economic development and revenues from the oil and gas sector, and well as explicit and implicit connections between Russian foreign policy and the oil and gas sector. In the changing world order, strategic manipulation, communication, persuasion and economic incentives became as important as military might or an outright threat in order to shape the outcome of international issues. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, oil and gas diplomacy, pipeline politics, subsidised <b>energy</b> <b>deliveries,</b> threats to cut-off <b>energy</b> <b>deliveries</b> coloured Russian attempts to revitalize influence throughout the territory of the former Soviet iv Union. Russia today is wedged between net consumers of energy which are competing to secure best terms for their oil and gas deliveries. As the Russian military capabilities fell after 1991, the policy around these vital resources has become the primary drivers of Russian domestic and foreign agenda. Another aim of this analysis is to contribute to the study of international relations by emphasizing its analysis of a state’s domestic agenda’s effect on the international arena. Domestic factors have a crucial relevance to relationships shared by actors at the international level. This dissertation will use Russia’s development of the oil and gas sector as a case for evaluating and understanding the relationship between domestic and international issues. Kara, GöktuğPh.

40|$|Abstract 1 – Since battery {{energy is}} often a premium {{resource}} in wireless sensor networks, many systems attempt to conserve battery energy by turning the transceivers off in a process referred to as duty-cycling. In [4 - 5], the authors proposed two different random duty-cycling protocols utilizing pseudo random number generators to efficiently exchange ON/OFF schedules among neighboring nodes for transmission coordination. We propose two simple transmission schemes that are superior {{to the performance of}} the schemes in [4 - 5] in terms of energy consumption and a macro network metric termed delivery capacity. The delivery capacity measures the maximum long term average unicast traffic delivery capability of a network. Through analyses and simulations, we present a detailed <b>energy</b> and <b>delivery</b> capacity tradeoff study of the transmission schemes in [4 - 5] and the schemes we propose. We show that one of our proposed schemes is near-optimal in energy consumption for low traffic loads. In addition, we provide insights on the appropriate ON/OFF dutycycling parameters that can achieve the optimal <b>energy</b> and <b>delivery</b> capacity tradeoff curve...|$|R
40|$|Russian energy {{production}} has increased substantially in recent years, with production {{of natural gas}} now actually exceeding the levels reached in the early 1990 s. The growth in {{energy production}} has gone {{hand in hand with}} a rise in Russian energy exports. The European Union is an extremely important sales area for Russia. Vice versa, <b>energy</b> <b>deliveries</b> from Russia account for a very sizable share of all energy supplies to Europe and Germany. Russia insists that it can continue to guarantee a stable supply of energy to Europe in the future. The energy strategy pursued in Russia foresees (similar to the energy plans of the past) significant increases in production and exports of the most important energy sources - crude oil and natural gas. Natural gas exports have remained below target to date, however. If energy export growth is to be accelerated, then besides higher investment in the energy sector, measures to improve energy efficiency and thus reduce domestic consumption are also required.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{our views}} on innovative approaches for financing rural energy services (RES), based on CORE International, Inc. ’s extensive worldwide {{experience in this}} area. The paper focuses on overall policy, institutional, and management approaches that we believe should be followed in creating the necessary market environment for large scale RES development in the SADC region and beyond. The general discussion focuses {{on the need for}} major changes in philosophy, principles, and institutions engaged in providing massive sustainable RES financing; changes dictated by the substantially changed environment for RES and rural electrification (RE) during the last decade. New, very important players – private sector, consumers, and regulators – are joining the team of RES and RE stakeholders, while the traditional ones – government, utilities, and donors – need to redefine their roles in this new structure and as a team should challenge poverty and make sustainable growth happen. Key Words: Sustainable rural <b>energy</b> service <b>delivery,</b> policies for increasing access to rural energy, rural energy and poverty alleviation, rural electrification authority, new approach to rural electrification financing, rural energy markets, public private partnerships for rural <b>energy</b> service <b>delivery,</b> central role of smart subsidies...|$|R
