[...] With the number of residents growing (the 1870 U.S. census reported a total Salt River Valley population of 240), a town site needed to be selected. On October 20, 1870, the residents held a meeting to decide where to locate it. [...] The decision was hotly contested between two sites: the original settlement around Swilling's farm, and a site about a mile to the west, which was supported by the newly founded [...] "Salt River Valley Town Association" [...] (SRVTA). [...] Due to economic considerations benefitting the members of SRVTA, the more westerly townsite was selected, and a [...] plot of land was purchased in what is now the downtown business section.|$|E
