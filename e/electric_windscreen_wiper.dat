The short [...] "A" [...] chassis, with a 2980 mm wheelbase, underpinned the two-seater models: the Motorway Courier, and the 1936 Special Roadster which offered the highest performance. All models featured such advanced equipment as safety glass, hydraulic brakes, and a 12-volt electrical system sufficient to bear the load of the <b>electric</b> <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers,</b> door locks, and indicators.|$|R

5000|$|Compared {{with the}} {{similarly}} priced, but much lighter and longer established Austin 7, the 1934/35 Morris Eight was well equipped. [...] The driver was {{provided with a}} full set of instruments including a speedometer with a built in odometer, oil pressure and fuel level gauges and an ammeter. [...] The more modern design of the Morris was reflected in the superior performance of its hydraulically operated 8-inch drum brakes. [...] The Morris also scored over its Ford rival by incorporating an <b>electric</b> <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> rather than the more old-fashioned vacuum powered equivalent, while its relatively wide 45 inch track aided directional stability on corners.|$|E

40|$|As modern {{passenger}} cars become increasingly quieter and comfort, automotive <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> {{noise and vibration}} become more noticeable. As {{a result of the}} market information survey, most complaints about the wiper concern operation noise. Wiper vibration and noise is classified into three main categories namely, squeal noise, chattering, and reversal noise. Squeal noise is a high-frequency vibration of about 1000 Hz. Chattering noise is a lowfrequency vibration of 100 Hz or less and reversal noise is an impact sound with a frequency of 500 Hz or less produced when the wiper reverses. Typically, noise and vibration study of the automotive <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> has been carried out by experimental, analytical and numerical approaches. This report describes evaluation of noise and vibration that generated by an automotive <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> using numerical approach via finite element method. In doing so, two types of test are conducted i. e. modal testing for individual wiper components and noise and vibration test to identify noise category for a selected passenger car <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> Later, a 3 -dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) model of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> assembly is developed. This FE model is then validated at the component level using modal analysis {{in order to ensure that}} dynamic characteristics of the FE model close to a real <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> In order to evaluate characteristics of noise and vibration of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper,</b> complex eigenvalue analysis that made available in ABAQUS is employed. It is found that the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> generates noise at frequency around 11 Hz which is identified as chatter and the predicted frequency is fairly close with measured frequency obtained in the experiment. This chatter noise is dominated by bending mode of the wiper blade. Having found the characteristics of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> noise, several structural modifications are proposed to the rubber blade and simulated once again. There are three modifications that capable of preventing noise and vibration in the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> This finding could help car makers to design quiet and effective <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> and in turn to produce quieter and comfort {{passenger cars}}...|$|R

50|$|In April 1908, {{he drove}} down to Crystal Palace Park in a 1904 Darracq-Charron {{motorcar}} to see Newcastle United play against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup final. It was such a novelty to see a car in those days that it was put into a car showroom window while he was there, {{because so many people}} wanted to see it. On the way back from the cup final, snow kept getting on the windscreen and Gladstone had to keep {{getting out of the car}} to clear it. This experience led to his invention of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> In April 1911, Gladstone patented the design of a <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> with Sloan & Lloyd Barnes, patent agents of Liverpool.
