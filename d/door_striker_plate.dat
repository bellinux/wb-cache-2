50|$|P-wave {{refraction}} {{evaluates the}} compression wave {{generated by the}} seismic source located at a known distance from the array. The wave is generated by vertically striking a <b>striker</b> <b>plate</b> with a sledgehammer, shooting a seismic shotgun into the ground, or detonating an explosive charge in the ground. Since the compression wave is the fastest of the seismic waves, it is {{sometimes referred to as}} the primary wave and is usually more-readily identifiable within the seismic recording as compared to the other seismic waves.|$|R

The Schlage Lock Company was incorporated with a starting capital of $30. In the same year, {{he applied for}} a patent for a lock that could be drilled into a door with only two holes. This new cylindrical lock had a single plate, serving as both escutcheon and <b>striker</b> <b>plate,</b> wrapping around the door's edge. It was mostly used on interior doors, where it replaced the older Mortise lock.|$|R
50|$|A snaphance or snaphaunce {{is a type}} of lock for {{firing a}} gun or is a gun using that {{mechanism}}. The name is Dutch in origin but the mechanism can not be attributed to the Netherlands with certainty. It is the mechanical progression of the wheellock firing mechanism, and along with the miquelet lock and doglock are predecessors of the flintlock mechanism. It fires from a flint struck against a <b>striker</b> <b>plate</b> above a steel pan to ignite the priming powder which fires the gun. Examples of this firearm can be found through Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.|$|R

40|$|An {{advanced}} {{docking system}} is undergoing development to enable softer, safer docking than was possible when using prior docking systems. This system {{is intended for}} original use in docking of visiting spacecraft and berthing the Crew Return Vehicle at the International Space Station (ISS). The system could also be adapted {{to a variety of}} other uses in outer space and on Earth, including mating submersible vehicles, assembling structures, and robotic berthing/handling of payloads and cargo. Heretofore, two large spacecraft have been docked by causing the spacecraft to approach each other at a speed sufficient to activate capture latches - a procedure that results in large docking loads and is made more difficult because of the speed. The basic design and mode of operation of the present advanced docking system would eliminate the need to rely on speed of approach to activate capture latches, thereby making it possible to reduce approach speed and thus docking loads substantially. The system would comprise an active subsystem on one spacecraft and a passive subsystem on another spacecraft with which the active subsystem will be docked. The passive subsystem would include an extensible ring containing magnetic <b>striker</b> <b>plates</b> and guide petals. The active subsystem would include mating guide petals and electromagnets containing limit switches and would be arranged to mate with the magnetic <b>striker</b> <b>plates</b> and guide petals of the passive assembly. The electromagnets would be carried on (but not rigidly attached to) a structural ring that would be instrumented with load sensors. The outputs of the sensors would be sent, along with position information, as feedback to an electronic control subsystem. The system would also include electromechanical actuators that would extend or retract the ring upon command by the control subsystem...|$|R

5000|$|As {{with the}} Mk2 Golf, Volkswagen {{did not make}} a {{convertible}} version of the Mk4 Golf. Instead, they face-lifted the front bumper, fenders, grille, and hood to resemble Mk4 Golf styling but to fit a Mk3 chassis. VW managed to incorporate some non-structural Mk4 parts as well such as fender repeaters, headlights, side mirror caps, rear license tag lights, 3-spoke steering wheel airbag, etc. The rear also received a redesigned bumper with the number plate tub moved from the hatch and a Mk4 handle with a larger VW emblem above it to resemble the rear of a Mk4 Golf. The interior largely remained the same as a Mk3 interior save for a Mk4 style 3-spoke leather steering wheel, a textured dashboard (also known as [...] "dimpled dash" [...] or [...] "shark skin dash"), heavily bolstered front seats with incorporated side airbags, and the hazard switch relocated from the steering column to the instrument panel. The interior lighting in the cabin was switched to the blue and red hue found in the Mk4 and some of the more familiar Mk3 parts were chromed such as the inner door handles, emergency brake button, <b>door</b> <b>strikers,</b> front seat belt anchors, key lock cylinders, and shifter button in automatic transmission equipped cars. There are some technical carryovers, as well, the main one being the immobilizer and engine computer from the Mk4 Golf being used with the older Mk3 engine mechanicals.|$|R

50|$|The {{interior}} was also much modified over that of earlier cars. There {{was a new}} dashboard with large speedometer and tachometer instruments in twin binnacles closer to the driver's line of sight. The instruments were mounted at a more conventional angle, avoiding the reflections caused by the upward angled flat dash of earlier cars. Conversely, auxiliary instruments were moved to angled bezels in the centre console, further from the driver's line of sight than before. The new seats introduced adjustable headrests which merged with {{the top of the}} seat when fully down. The window winder levers, the door release levers and the quarterlight vent knobs were also restyled. The remote release for the boot (trunk) lid, located {{on the inside of the}} door opening on the B-post just under the <b>door</b> lock <b>striker,</b> was moved from the right hand side of the car to the left hand side. The location of this item was always independent of whether the car was left hand drive or right hand drive.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe multiaxial {{impact test}} in {{polymers}} is analyzed. The impact response of a propylene copolymer is characterized under different test conditions. Due {{to the nature}} of the impact event and to the complex material behavior, an intricate stress state is developed rendering rather difficult the assessment of the intrinsic impact properties. Furthermore, processing determine polymer microstructure, which significantly influences the impact response. The multiaxial impact test was simulated using a finite element code. The computed force-displacement curves fall in between the computed ones with two extreme contact conditions between <b>striker</b> and <b>plate.</b> Friction plays an important role from medium strain levels until the peak force is reached, determining its intensity. The constitutive coefficients at high strain-rates were identified by an inverse method. The adopted constitutive model allows the computation of the force-deflection curve until the force peak, but not its full description. For that, a modified version was used that more correctly takes into account the strain hardening of the polymer. Finally, it is emphasized the importance of the knowledge of the heat conversion factor for realistically predicting the mechanical behavior of polymers at high strain-rates...|$|R
5000|$|In 1968, {{concurrently}} {{with the}} replacement of the Giulia Sprint GT Veloce by the 1750 GTV, the GT 1300 Junior was revised with many of the new parts from the 1750 GTV. This included the dashboard, the suspension and the new wheel size of 5½ × 14J instead of 4½ × 15J. This revised GT 1300 Junior, however, retained the early [...] "step-front" [...] body style, which, interestingly, makes it the most mechanically refined production [...] "step-front" [...] model. Another intriguing detail is that, just as on the 1750 GTV, the remote release for the boot (trunk) lid, located {{on the inside of the}} door opening on the B-post just under the <b>door</b> lock <b>striker,</b> was moved from the right hand side of the car to the left hand side. The location of this item was always independent of whether the car was left hand drive or right hand drive. This series of GT 1300 Junior was the only model with the step-front bodyshell to have this item mounted on the left hand side. All other step-front models - Giulia Sprint GT, Giulia Sprint GT Veloce, and early GT 1300 Junior with flat dashboard - featured this item on the right hand side.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} and analyzes the behaviour of TRIP 1000 steel sheets subjected to low velocity perforation by conical projectiles. The relevance {{of this material}} resides in the potential transformation of retained austenite to martensite during impact loading. This process leads {{to an increase in}} strength and ductility of the material. However, this transformation takes place only under certain loading conditions strongly dependent on the initial temperature and deformation rate. In order to study the material behaviour under impact loading, perforation tests have been performed using a drop weight tower. Experiments were carried out at two different initial temperatures T 0 213 K and T 0 288 K, and within the range of impact velocities 2. 5 m/s 6 V 0 6 4. 5 m/s. The experimental setup enabled the measuring of impact velocity, residual velocity, load time history and failure mode. In addition, dry and lubricated contacts between the <b>striker</b> and the <b>plate</b> have been investigated. Finally, by using X ray diffraction {{it has been shown that}} no martensitic transformation takes place during the perforation process. The causes involving the none appearance of martensite are examined...|$|R
