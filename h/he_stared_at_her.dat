60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> without speaking. She came to him, laughing.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> fixedly, seeming fearful and {{uncertain}} how to answer.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{with his}} round eyes, {{playing with his}} locket.|$|E
60|$|Her husband's {{face was}} white with astonishment. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> across <b>at</b> <b>her</b> blankly.|$|R
60|$|Those words, {{and still}} more her tone, stunned him as if {{somebody}} had fired a gun close to his ear. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> back <b>at</b> <b>her</b> stupidly.|$|R
6000|$|As <b>he</b> still <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> in her {{inconsistent}} finery, draggled and wet by the storm, <b>at</b> <b>her</b> limp {{ribbons and}} ostentatious jewelry, she continued, {{in the same}} hard voice,-- ...|$|R
60|$|She {{spoke with}} girlish shyness, which {{increased}} as <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Hare did not understand. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> unbelievingly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{trying to}} {{guess at the}} mystery of her thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{been like}} that ever since this morning. Mr. Fiorsen's been in more than once, ma'am, and the fact is, baby don't like it. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> so. But this morning I thought--well--I thought: 'You're her father. It's time she was getting used to you.' So I let them be a minute; and when I came back--I was only just across to the bathroom--he was comin' out lookin' quite fierce and white, and baby--oh, screamin'! And except for sleepin', she's hardly stopped cryin' since." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> back <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{until his}} plump pink face was all consternation. He was {{extraordinarily}} distressed. It {{was as if}} a thousand unspoken things had been said between them.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it, Kirylo Sidorovitch?" [...] There was {{a hint of}} {{tenderness}} in that cry. <b>He</b> only <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in that complete {{surrender of}} all his faculties which in a happy lover {{would have had the}} name of ecstasy.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{and made}} {{as if to}} tear her hands from their hold.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> with {{something}} of wonder {{and more of}} admiration in his look.|$|E
60|$|Edward {{was still}} inarticulate. His face twitched, his eyes watered as <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the {{foremost}} rider had pulled in his horse near the door. He was a young giant with hulking shoulders, ruddy-faced, bold-eyed, ugly-mouthed. He reminded Allie of some one she had seen in California. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> hard <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|The First and Foremost saw Ozma and her companions {{beyond the}} fountain, {{but instead of}} {{making an effort to}} capture <b>her</b> <b>he</b> merely <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in pleased admiration of her beauty--for he had {{forgotten}} where he was and why he had come there.|$|R
60|$|Her breath stopped. All Letty's being {{seemed to}} stop. And this {{stranger}} {{who was also}} incredibly familiar, after <b>he</b> had <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> motionless form for a moment, waved his hat with a gesture--a gesture that crowned and scaled the effect of familiarity. She gave no sign in reply.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> as if {{her words}} had {{recalled}} something long forgotten. Then he smiled.|$|E
60|$|Ethan was vanquished. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in {{speechless}} surprise, his jaw hanging. It was incredible.|$|E
60|$|For {{some moments}} <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{trying to get}} back to their point of divergence.|$|E
6000|$|... [But as <b>he</b> {{continues}} to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> a strange disorder appears in his face. MAGGIE feels {{that it is}} to be now or never.] ...|$|R
50|$|Brushing {{his hand}} across his face, Kagenobu sates his curiosity if the fury that drove Eliza {{to the school and}} once lingered deep within her was no longer there. Offended by him {{questioning}} her, Eliza slaps his hand away while informing him the fury still remains. While Eliza demands to know what would become of her father since he is a foreigner himself, Kagenobu tells her he is protected since he is of value to The Hand since they have been using him as an unwitting spy for all the years they’ve known the two. Enraged by Kagenobu’s betrayal, Eliza slaps him and turns her back on him as <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> coldly while rubbing his jaw struck by her blow.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> drew back, <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{and with}} no trace of {{personal}} animus, like one who hears of a common disaster, remarked with a quiet emphasis: [...] "Oh, damn!" ...|$|R
60|$|Ethel {{appeared}} in the half doorway and her, expression was unfamiliar. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> white face.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{almost like}} one demented, {{or as if}} he thought that she, perhaps, had lost her reason.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> thoughtfully a moment. Then he {{selected}} a paper from his mail {{and handed it}} to her.|$|E
50|$|Mr. Gibb {{secretly}} has a {{crush on}} Ally. <b>He</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> inappropriately multiple times a day. One day after school, he overhears Ally and her boyfriend Brett (John Gallagher, Jr.) get into a big argument. She no longer has a ride home from school, so he offers to take her home. Mr. Gibb and Ally are photographed just as she spontaneously kisses him on the lips (to thank him for giving her an unexpected A), and as such the school board deems his behavior unacceptable and unprofessional. She goes missing after he drops <b>her</b> off <b>at</b> <b>her</b> house. The news reports that a kidnapping has occurred. Mr. Gibb is the primary suspect because police officials find evidence that he was with Ally moments before she was kidnapped. The film follows Gibb as he copes with public humiliation and ends with a sudden twist in the final minutes.|$|R
5000|$|Catherine had {{expected}} Sir Robert to decline the case, or at best {{to treat it}} as a political tool; instead, he is coolly matter-of-fact about having been persuaded of Ronnie's innocence by his responses to questioning (in fact, a form of cross-examination, to see how young Ronnie would hold up in court) {{in the presence of}} his family. Catherine, a left-wing suffragette, is not enthusiastic about Morton, whom she considers cold and heartless. Catherine is also disturbed by Sir Robert's establishment views: he is a conservative opponent of women’s suffrage. [...] "He always speaks out against what is right," [...] she observes to her father, though she admires his legal skills. Morton, for his part, obviously is quite taken with Catherine from the moment he meets her in his offices; later <b>he</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> as she arrives at the House of Commons and as she watches the proceedings from the ladies' gallery.|$|R
60|$|She was {{all over}} in a flutter as their eyes met, and she put on the very best smile she could muster, and dropped him a little, timid, imploring curtsey. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> aghast <b>at</b> <b>her</b> for a minute, as Macbeth might on beholding Banquo's sudden {{appearance}} at his ball-supper, and remained looking <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with open mouth, when that horrid Major Loder pulled her away.|$|R
60|$|Her {{eyes and}} words smote him with amazement. <b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{like a man}} who awakens. She looked down.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{and to her}} amazement he smiled. He {{spoke as}} one who remarks upon a quite {{unexpected}} fact....|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> vacuously. Some such rumour {{had already}} reached him, and he {{conceived}} {{that here was}} definite confirmation of it.|$|E
60|$|It was astounding. The {{noise in}} his throat ceased. But <b>he</b> still <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> And then the nurse made a kind of assault upon Lady Harman, caught her--even if she didn't fall. It was no doubt the proper formula to collapse. Or to fling oneself upon the deceased. Lady Harman {{resisted}} this assistance, disentangled herself and remained amazed; the nurse a little disconcerted but still ready behind her.|$|R
60|$|Jim stopped {{inside the}} door, as {{immovable}} as a setter at {{the scent of}} quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, {{and there was an}} expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. <b>He</b> simply <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Croquet!" [...] <b>He</b> gulped, and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with unseeing eyes. He was no prude, but he {{had those}} decent prejudices of which no self-respecting man can wholly rid himself, however broad-minded he may try to be. [...] "Croquet!" ...|$|R
