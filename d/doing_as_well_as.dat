25|$|From 1926 to 1941, {{scores on}} the SAT were scaled to make 500 the mean score on each section. In 1941 and 1942, SAT scores were {{standardized}} via test equating, and as a consequence, average verbal and math scores could vary from that time forward. In 1952, mean verbal and math scores were 476 and 494, respectively, and scores were generally stable in the 1950s and early 1960s. However, starting in the mid-1960s and continuing until the early 1980s, SAT scores declined: the average verbal score dropped by about 50 points, and the average math score fell by about 30 points. By the late 1970s, only the upper third of test takers were <b>doing</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> {{the upper half of}} those taking the SAT in 1963. From 1961 to 1977, the number of SATs taken per year doubled, suggesting that the decline could be explained by demographic changes in the group of students taking the SAT. Commissioned by the College Board, an independent study of the decline found that most (up to about 75%) of the test decline in the 1960s could be explained by compositional changes in the group of students taking the test; however, only about 25 percent of the 1970s decrease in test scores could similarly be explained. Later analyses suggested that up to 40 percent of the 1970s decline in scores could be explained by demographic changes, leaving unknown {{at least some of the}} reasons for the decline.|$|E

60|$|Now, how {{had this}} noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the slowly {{descending}} head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom, {{so as to}} scuttle a large hole there; then dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards, and so hauled out our poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing {{that that was not}} as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;--he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in the good old way-- head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was <b>doing</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> could be expected.|$|E
60|$|As he sauntered along {{he kicked}} the stones {{out of his}} way savagely, and {{appeared}} to find relief to his feelings in so <b>doing,</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> by allowing his sword to rasp across the rocks and shrubs at his side. It might have been observed, however, that Glumm only kicked the little stones {{out of his way}}; he never kicked the big ones. It is interesting to observe how trifling a matter will bring out a trait of human nature! Men will sometimes relieve their angry feelings by storming violently at those of their fellows who cannot hurt them, but, strangely enough, they manage to obtain relief to these same feelings without storming, when they chance to be in the company of stronger men than themselves, thereby proving that they have powers of self-restraint which prudence-- not to say fear--can call into exercise! commend this moral reflection particularly to the study of boys.|$|E
