This {{is illustrated by}} the non-neoplastic gastric-type <b>heteroplasias</b> present at birth in the pericaecal region of Cdx 2 +/- mice. Furthermore, intestinal expression of Cdx 2 continues throughout life but diminishes in colorectal cancers compared with adjacent normal tissue, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis. Aim: To investigate the consequence of altered Cdx 2 expression on colon tumour initiation and/or progression. Methods: Heterozygous Cdx 2 +/- mice were analysed for spontaneous malignant tumours and for tumour development after treatment with a DNA mutagen, azoxymethane. Results: Cdx 2 +/- mice did not spontaneously develop malignant tumours. After azoxymethane treatment, the gastric-like <b>heteroplasias</b> in the pericaecal region did not evolve into cancer indicating that they are not precancerous lesions. However, azoxymethane treated Cdx 2 +/- mice developed tumours specifically in the distal colon 12 weeks after azoxymethane treatment whereas no tumours were found in wild-type littermates at this stage. Histopathological and molecular analyses indicated that these tumours were invasive adenocarcinomas that recapitulated the malignant sequence observed in the majority of sporadic colorectal cancers in human. In addition, we found that the colonic epithelium was less sensitive to radiation induced apoptosis in Cdx 2 +/- than in wild-type mice. Conclusion: This study provides the first experimental evidence that Cdx 2 is a tumour suppressor gene involved in cancer progression in the distal colon. This action in adults is functionally and geographically distinct from its homeotic role during gut development...|$|R
5000|$|According to the Progressive Osseous <b>Heteroplasia</b> Association: Progressive Osseous <b>Heteroplasia</b> (POH) {{is a rare}} genetic {{condition}} in which the body makes extra bone in locations where bone should not form.

5000|$|Metaplasia ("change in form") is the {{reversible}} {{transformation of}} one differentiated cell type to another differentiated cell type. The change from {{one type of}} cell to another {{may be part of}} a normal maturation process, or caused by some sort of abnormal stimulus. In simplistic terms, {{it is as if the}} original cells are not robust enough to withstand their environment, so they transform into another cell type better suited to their environment. If the stimulus causing metaplasia is removed or ceases, tissues return to their normal pattern of differentiation. Metaplasia is not synonymous with dysplasia, and is not considered to be an actual cancer. [...] It is also contrasted with <b>heteroplasia,</b> which is the spontaneous abnormal growth of cytologic and histologic elements. Today, metaplastic changes are usually considered to be an early phase of carcinogenesis, specifically for those with a history of cancers or who are known to be susceptible to carcinogenic changes.Metaplastic change is often viewed as a premalignant condition that requires immediate intervention, either surgical or medical, because metaplasia is associated with cancer.|$|E

40|$|Congenital gastric-type <b>heteroplasia</b> {{is common}} in {{intestinal}} duplications and anomalies, which originate from incomplete resorption of the omphalomesenteric duct during development. Two transcription factors determine the proximodistal specification of the gastrointestinal tract, SOX 2, expressed exclusively in the proximal part of the primitive gut, and CDX 2, expressed solely in the distal part. Aberrant expression of these factors may result in abnormal development and congenital abnormalities. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of SOX 2 and CDX 2 {{in a number of}} pediatric intestinal anomalies. We investigated the expression pattern of SOX 2 and CDX 2 in three congenital intestinal anomalies in which ectopic gastric tissue may be present, Meckel's diverticulum (N = 8), persistent ductus omphalomesentericus (N = 14), and intestinal duplications (N = 8). CDX 2, but not SOX 2, was detected in intestinal epithelial cells in tissue lacking gastric <b>heteroplasia.</b> In gastric-type <b>heteroplasia,</b> a reciprocal expression pattern existed between SOX 2 and CDX 2 in the gastric and intestinal tissues, respectively. Interestingly, patches of CDX 2 -positive cells were present within the gastric mucosa in a subset of Meckel's diverticula and intestinal duplications, suggesting {{that it is not the}} absence of CDX 2, but rather the ectopic expression of SOX 2 that leads to gastric tissue in the prospective intestinal tissue. This is in concordance with our previous mouse studies. Collectively, our data indicate that a fine balance between SOX 2 and CDX 2 expression in the gastrointestinal tract is essential for proper development and that ectopic expression of SOX 2 may lead to malformations of the gut...|$|E

40|$|Bone {{formation}} is exquisitely controlled {{in space and}} time. Heterotopic ossification (HO), the pathologic formation of extra-skeletal bone, occurs as a common complication of trauma or in genetic disorders and can be disabling and lethal. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that Gαs restricts bone formation to the skeleton by inhibiting Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in mesenchymal progenitor cells. In progressive osseous <b>heteroplasia</b> (POH), a human disease caused by null mutations in GNAS that encodes Gαs, HH signaling is upregulated in ectopic osteoblasts and progenitor cells. Ectopic Hh signaling is sufficient to induce HO, while Hh signaling inhibition blocks HO in animal models.

40|$|Heterotopic {{ossification}} (HO) is {{the process}} by which calcified bone develops in soft tissues. Because of the abnormal calcification, complications such as bone deformation, loss of range of motion, and joint immobility adversely affect patients. There are many genetic types of heterotopic ossification, namely fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, progressive osseous <b>heteroplasia,</b> and Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. However, this condition can also arise from surgery, burns, or traumatic injuries, so it is seen as an important area for research in the future. There are various treatments available such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and radiation therapy, as well as combinations of the two. The molecular basis of HO is currently being explored in hopes of developing drugs that prevent the development of heterotopic bone. Additionally, new methods of treatment that offer fewer side effects may be promising for patients in the future...|$|E
30|$|HO {{is another}} non-neoplastic lesion that shows calcifications {{in the early}} stages, before the typical bone {{organisation}} pattern is recognised (Fig. 3). When occurring in a muscle, it is called myositis ossificans circumscripta, {{but it can be}} found in virtually any soft tissue, after trauma. Myositis ossificans can have an aggressive and worrisome clinical presentation and histopathology, suggesting a sarcoma. Follow up study with radiograph or CT is recommended and will show faint calcifications that will eventually evolve towards a focal ossification with a classical zonal distribution (Fig. 3). Burns are a classic cause of heterotopic ossification. Chronic venous insufficiency in the lower extremities will often have heterotopic ossification with a honeycomb appearance that coalesces in the subcutaneous tissues [41]. There are two hereditary forms called progressive osseous <b>heteroplasia</b> and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive. The latter causes severe ossifications that will eventually prevent adequate motion, causing respiratory failure and death at an early age.|$|E

These flare-ups transform skeletal muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia, and aponeuroses into heterotopic bone, rendering movement impossible. Patients with atypical forms of FOP have been described. They either present with the classic features of FOP plus one or more atypical features [FOP plus], or present with major variations in {{one or both of the}} two classic defining features of FOP [FOP variants].

However, this classification disregards other related diseases such as acrodysostosis (ACRDYS) or progressive osseous <b>heteroplasia</b> (POH), as well as recent findings of clinical and genetic/epigenetic background of the different subtypes. Therefore, the EuroPHP network decided to develop a new classification that encompasses all disorders with impairments in PTH and/or PTHrP cAMP-mediated pathway. ăDESIGN AND METHODS: Extensive review of the literature was performed. Several meetings were organised to discuss about a new, more effective and accurate way to describe disorders caused by abnormalities of the PTH/PTHrP signalling pathway. ăRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: After determining the major and minor criteria to be considered for the diagnosis of these disorders, we proposed to group them under the term 'inactivating PTH/PTHrP signalling disorder' (iPPSD). This terminology: (i) defines the common mechanism responsible for all diseases; (ii) does not require a confirmed genetic defect; (iii) avoids ambiguous terms like 'pseudo' and (iv) eliminates the clinical or molecular overlap between diseases. We believe that the use of this nomenclature and classification will facilitate the development of rationale and comprehensive international guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of iPPSDs...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCONTEXT: Heterozygous GNAS inactivating {{mutations}} {{are known}} to induce pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1 a when maternally inherited and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism when paternally inherited. Progressive osseous <b>heteroplasia</b> (POH) is a rare disease of ectopic bone formation, and studies in different families have shown that POH is also caused by paternally inherited GNAS mutations. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to characterize parental origin of the mutated allele in de novo cases of POH and to draw phenotype/genotype correlations according to maternal or paternal transmission of a same GNAS mutation. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a retrospective study on patients addressed to our referral center for the rare diseases of calcium and phosphorus metabolism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We matched 10 cases of POH with cases of pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1 a carrying the same GNAS mutations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The parental origin of the mutated allele was studied using informative intragenic polymorphisms and subcloning of PCR products. RESULTS: Paternal origin of GNAS mutations was clearly demonstrated in eight POH cases including one patient with mutation in exon 1. Genotype/phenotype analyses {{suggest that there is}} no direct correlation between the ossifying process and the position of the inactivating GNAS mutation. It is, however, more severe in patients in whom origin of the mutation is paternal. Severe intrauterine growth retardation was clearly evidenced in paternally inherited mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical heterogeneity makes genetic counseling a delicate matter, especially in which paternal inheritance is concerned because it can lead to either a mild expression of pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism or a severe expression of POH...|$|E

At present, there is no definitive treatment, but a brief 4 -day course of high-dose corticosteroids, started within the first 24 hours of a flare-up, may help reduce the intense inflammation and tissue edema seen in the early stages of the disease. Preventative management is based on prophylactic measures against falls, respiratory decline, and viral infections. The median lifespan is approximately 40 years of age. Most patients are wheelchair-bound by the end of the second decade of life and commonly die of complications of thoracic insufficiency syndrome. </p...|$|E
