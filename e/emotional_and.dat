40|$|A field {{sample of}} 1100 {{employees}} in the army was investigated to study {{the relationship between the}} individuals’ self reported <b>emotional</b> intelligence <b>and</b> learning outcomes in work groups, with two dimensions of emotional conflict as mediators, <b>emotional</b> person conflict <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> task conflict. Most importantly, emotional intelligence predicted positively learning outcomes <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> task conflict, <b>and</b> predicted negatively <b>emotional</b> person conflict. Further, emotional task conflict predicted learning outcomes positively, whereas emotional person conflict predicted learning outcome negatively. Particularly, the ability of regulation own emotions accounted for the negative relationship between <b>emotional</b> intelligence <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> person conflict, <b>and</b> the ability of self emotion appraisal accounted for the positive relationship between <b>emotional</b> intelligence <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> task conflict. However, the mediating effect of emotional conflict was weak, as the relationship between <b>emotional</b> intelligence <b>and</b> learning outcomes remained strongly significant also after the two emotional conflict dimensions were added to the model.

In this cross-sectional study among 149 high school teachers, the relationship between emotional labour – in this study conceptualized as <b>emotional</b> demands – <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> exhaustion <b>and</b> work engagement respectively was studied. First of all, it was examined whether emotional dissonance mediates the relationship between <b>emotional</b> demands <b>and</b> both <b>emotional</b> exhaustion <b>and</b> work engagement. Next, the possible moderating effect of two emotion regulation strategies, surface acting and deep acting, {{on the relationship between}} <b>emotional</b> dissonance <b>and</b> the two outcome variables was studied. The results showed that emotional dissonance partially mediated the relationship between <b>emotional</b> demands <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> exhaustion. Furthermore, it was found that deep acting had a buffer effect on the negative relationship between <b>emotional</b> dissonance <b>and</b> work engagement. Finally, the implications of the results are discussed and suggestions for further research are mentioned.

40|$|The {{severity}} of teachers’ <b>emotional</b> labour <b>and</b> burnout {{has become more}} significant recently; however, {{only a limited number}} of researches have examined the relationship between <b>emotional</b> requirements <b>and</b> burnout of teachers. This study aims (1) to investigate the level of emotional labour, <b>emotional</b> consonance, <b>and</b> burnout among South Korean middle school teachers, and (2) to explore the relationship of burnout with <b>emotional</b> labour <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> consonance. This study was conducted in a sample of 152 teachers, with two scales measuring <b>emotional</b> labour <b>and</b> burnout respectively: Dutch Questionnaire on <b>Emotional</b> Labour (D-QEL) <b>and</b> The Dutch Educators Survey (mbi-nl-es). The results indicate that South Korean teachers perform a high level of emotional labour; while they show low emotional consonance. They are also found to be highly burnt-out, particularly in <b>emotional</b> exhaustion <b>and</b> depersonalization. Correlational analyses reveal that emotional exhaustion is significantly correlated with every dimension of emotional labour. Depersonalization has a positive, statistically significant correlation with surface acting and suppression. Multiple linear regression analyses suggest that among the dimensions of emotional labour, surface acting is the strongest predictor of <b>emotional</b> exhaustion <b>and</b> depersonalization. However, no relationship is found between <b>emotional</b> labour <b>and</b> reduced personal accomplishment. In contrast, the key finding is that emotional consonance, the absence of emotional labour, is negatively correlated to every dimension of burnout. Moreover, emotional consonance contributes to the increase in personal accomplishment. This result suggests an approach from a different direction towards understanding emotional requirements for future research: the positive influences of emotional consonance...|$|R
