40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent advances}} made in computational modelling {{of the sugar}} cane liquid extraction process. The saturated fibro-porous material is rolled between circumferentially grooved rolls, which enhance <b>frictional</b> <b>grip</b> and provide a low-resistance path for liquid flow during the extraction process. Previously reported two-dimensional (2 D) computational models, account for the large deformation of the porous material by solving the fully coupled governing fibre stress and fluid-flow equations using finite element techniques. While the 2 D simulations provide much insight into the overarching cause-effect relationships, predictions of mechanical quantities such as roll separating force and particularly torque {{as a function of}} roll speed and degree of compression are not satisfactory for industrial use. It is considered that the unsatisfactory response in roll torque prediction {{may be due to the}} stress levels that exist between the groove tips and roots which have been largely neglected in the geometrically simplified 2 D model. This paper gives results for both two- and three-dimensional finite element models and highlights their strengths and weaknesses in predicting key milling parameters. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Studies of primate {{taxonomy}} and phylogeny often {{depend on}} comparisons of limb dimensions, {{yet there is}} little information on how morphology correlates and contributes to foraging strategies and ecology. Callitrichid primates are ideal for comparative studies as they exhibit a range of body size, limb proportions and diet. Many callitrichid species exhibit {{a high degree of}} exudativory, and to efficiently exploit these resources, they are assumed to have evolved morphologies that reflect a level of dependence on these resources. We tested assumptions by considering measurements of limb proportion and frictional features of the volar surfaces in preserved specimens of 25 species with relation to published life history and ecological data. The degree of exudativory and utilization of vertical substrates during foraging were found to correlate both with size and with size-corrected foot and hand dimensions. Smaller species, which engage in greater degrees of exudativory, had proportionally longer hands and feet and more curved claw-like tegulae (nails) on their digits to facilitate climbing on vertical substrates. The density of patterned ridges (dermatoglyphs) on the volar surfaces of the hands and feet is higher in more exudativorous genera, suggesting a role in climbing on vertical tree trunks during foraging. Dermatoglyph comparisons suggest that ridges on the soles and palms may facilitate food procurement by enhancing <b>frictional</b> <b>grip</b> during exudate feeding. Volar pad features corroborate taxonomic relationships described from dental morphology...|$|E

40|$|Previously {{the authors}} have {{presented}} both theoretical and experimental work discussing the operating mechanism of a wire rope held in a tapered socket {{by means of a}} cast resin cone. The work reported here extends the investigation to address {{the question of whether the}} same socket fabricated with white metal operates in the same manner. To date, previous investigations have compared the operational efficiency of resin and white metal in terms of both strength and/or fatigue endurance. Some other work has analysed the operation of resin sockets or specific cast metal terminations. This paper seeks to draw the results from this work together, and, in addition to a theoretical analysis, presents experimental data obtained from a direct comparison of the operation mechanism for the same sockets filled with resin or white metal. Results show that white metal terminations have a very different distribution of stresses along the length of the socket basket from resin terminations, and a smaller but still significant amount of socket draw. For both types of termination the socket draw develops high <b>frictional</b> <b>gripping</b> forces which can transfer the load from the rope to the socket. The different stress distributions mean that the consequences of termination fabrication defects may not be the same for resin and white metal terminations...|$|R
40|$|Various robotic exoskeletons {{have been}} {{proposed}} for hand function assistance during {{activities of daily living}} (ADL) of stroke survivors. However, traditional exoskeletons involve the use of complex rigid systems that impede the natural movement of joints, and thus reduce the wearability and cause discomfort to the user. The objective {{of this paper is to}} design and evaluate a soft robotic glove that is able to provide hand function assistance using fabric-reinforced soft pneumatic actuators. These actuators are made of silicone rubber which has an elastic modulus similar to human tissues. Thus, they are intrinsically soft and compliant. Upon air pressurization, they are able to support finger range of motion (ROM) and generate the desired actuation of the finger joints. In this work, the soft actuators were characterized in terms of their blocked tip force, normal and <b>frictional</b> <b>grip</b> force outputs. Combining the soft actuators and flexible textile materials, a soft robotic glove was developed for grasping assistance during ADL for stroke survivors. The glove was evaluated on five healthy participants for its assisted ROM and grip strength. Pilot test was performed in two stroke survivors to evaluate the efficacy of the glove in assisting functional grasping activities. Our results demonstrated that the actuators designed in this study could generate desired force output at a low air pressure. The glove had a high kinematic transparency and did not affect the active ROM of the finger joints when it was being worn by the participants. With the assistance of the glove, the participants were able to perform grasping actions with sufficient assisted ROM and grip strength, without any voluntary effort. Additionally, pilot test on stroke survivors demonstrated that the patient 2 ̆ 7 s grasping performance improved with the presence and assistance of the glove. Patient feedback questionnaires also showed high level of patient satisfaction and comfort. In conclusion, this paper has demonstrated the possibility of using soft wearable exoskeletons that are more wearable, lightweight, and suitable to be used on a daily basis for hand function assistance of stroke survivors during activities of daily living...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into two parts; the first part {{presents}} results on the effect of the flow of fluids and electrochemical bias on single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT). Issues pertaining to the entry of water into the cylindrical pores of the SWNT and its freezing dynamics have also been addressed {{in the first part of}} the thesis. The second part of the thesis deals with Raman scattering studies of iron perovskite namely CaFeO 3 and La 0. 33 Sr 0. 67 FeO 3 across their charge-disproportionation transition temperatures. PART 1 Chapter 1 : Introduction This chapter presents an overview of the systems studied in this thesis, i. e., (i) SWNT and (ii) iron perovskite’s containing iron in Fe 4 +(d 4) state, namely CaFeO 3 and La 0. 33 Sr 0. 67 FeO 3. It also contains an introduction to the two spectroscopic techniques used in the present thesis, namely Raman scattering and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. A quantum mechanical picture of Raman scattering, in general, and resonance Raman scattering in particular along with a brief introduction to the apparatus used both for the micro Raman and the low temperature experiments is presented in this chapter. A general introduction to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is also given with an emphasis on various interactions leading to the broadening of the NMR absorption linewidths. Chapter 2 : Carbon nanotube liquid flow sensors This chapter presents experimental results and theoretical understandings of the generation of electrical signals by flowing polar/ionic liquids over a mat of SWNT. We first present experimental findings that the flow of a variety of liquids on SWNT bundles induces an electrical signal (voltage/current) in the sample along the direction of the flow. The electrical response is found to be a logarithmic function of the flow speed over a wide range. The magnitude of the signal generated depends sensitively on the ionic conductivity and the polar nature of the liquid and weakly on the viscosity of the liquid. Furthermore its direction can be controlled by electrochemical biasing of the nanotubes. The ratio of the open circuit voltage to the short circuit current is found to be governed by the nanotube resistance. These experimental findings are inconsistent with the conventional idea of a streaming potential as the possible cause. Our measurements suggest that the dominant mechanism responsible for this highly sub-linear response should involve a direct forcing of the free charge carriers in the nanotubes by the fluctuating Coulombic ﬁeld of the liquid flowing past it. Two alternative understandings of the experimental findings are also presented in this chapter. The first mechanism invokes the idea of a “pulsating ratchet” whereby the charge carriers in the nanotubes experience an asymmetric spatial bias because of the shear-induced deformation of the ion-plus-polar atmosphere at the liquid-solid interface temporally modulated by the liquid flow. In addition, we also propose that experimental findings can be understood qualitatively in terms of three interrelated ideas: (a) Induced friction: The fluctuating charge density of the ions close to the nanotube couples coulombically to the charge carriers in the nanotube and, therefore, offers a friction to the motion of these charge carriers (in addition to the Ohmic friction intrinsic to the carbon nanotubes); (b) Flow-induced drag: In virtue of the above frictional coupling, an imposed liquid flow drags the charge carriers along through the nanotube; (c) Reduction of induced friction at high flow speeds: The space-time correlated Coulombic fluctuations, inherent to the liquid electrolyte, are advected by the liquid flow, and thus get Galilean boosted (Doppler shifted) as seen in the mean rest frame of the drifting carriers in the nanotube. This would cause a reduction of the <b>frictional</b> <b>grip</b> to the motion of the charge carriers in the nanotube with increasing ﬂow speed resulting in a sublinear dependence of the charge drift-velocity (electrical response) on the liquid flow speed. With the above in mind, a quantitative derivation of these frictional effects, first from a heuristic argument, and then analytically from a Langevin-equation treatment have been presented. Chapter 3 : Direct generation of voltage and current by gas flow over carbon nanotubes and semiconductors Having obtained experimental evidence of the generation of liquid flow induced electrical signals over single-walled carbon nanotubes, it was only natural to look for the same effect by flowing gases over nanotubes. We show here a direct generation of measurable voltages and currents when gas flows at modest speeds of a few meters per second over single-walled carbon nanotubes. Interestingly, unlike the previous effect (generation of voltages by flow of liquids over single-walled carbon nanotubes), this effect is not specific to single-walled carbon nanotubes and occurs for a wide variety of solids, including single and multi-walled carbon nanotubes, doped semiconductors and metals. Moreover, the gas flow induced signals depend quadratically on the gas flow velocities. This is in sharp contrast to the results obtained by flowing liquids over single-walled carbon nanotubes where the liquid flow generated signal was found to be logarithmically dependent on the flow velocities. In this chapter we provide evidence that the underlying mechanism for the gas flow generated electrical signal is an interplay of Bernoulli’s principle and the Seebeck effect: Pressure difference along streamlines gives rise to temperature difference across the sample which, in turn, produces the measured voltage. Chapter 4 : Water at nanoscale confined in single-walled carbon nanotubes studied by NMR In this chapter, we seek experimental evidence of the occupancy of water in the cylindrical pores of the nanotubes. Proton NMR studies have been carried out as a function of temperature from 210 K to 300 K of water confined within SWNT. The NMR lineshape at and below the freezing point of bulk water is asymmetric which can be decomposed into a sum of two Lorentzians. The intensities of both the components decrease with lowering of temperature below 273 K, one component L 1 vanishing below 242 K and the other component L 2 below 217 K. Following the simulations of Koga et al. (Nature, 412, 802, 2001) showing that the radial density profile of confined water in SWNT has a distribution peak at the center which disappears below the freezing temperature, the L 1 component is associated with the protons of the water molecules at the center and the L 2 component is associated with protons of water molecules associated at a distance ~ 3 Å away from the walls of the nanotubes. In this scenario the complete freezing of the water at ~ 212 K is preceded by the withdrawal of the water molecules from the center of the nanotubes. Chapter 5 : Electrochemical tuning of band structure of single walled carbon nanotubes probed by in-situ resonance Raman scattering The work presented in this chapter is motivated by the experimental observation that SWNT have excellent actuating properties, i. e, porous sheets of carbon nanotubes were shown to suffer length changes when subjected to electrochemical bias, with action observed up to 1 KHz. The fast response of the nanotube actuator rules out any mechanism related to the intercalation of ions as is applicable to the case of the polymer actuators. This chapter presents results of in-situ resonance Raman scattering of SWNT investigated under electrochemical biasing. The experimental results show that the intensity of the radial breathing mode varies significantly in a non-monotonic manner as a function of the cathodic bias voltage, but does not change appreciably under anodic bias. The tangential mode is, however, not affected. These results can be quantitatively understood in terms of the changes in the energy gaps between the one-dimensional van Hove singularities in the electron density of states arising possibly due to the alterations in the overlap integral of π-bonds between the p-orbitals of adjacent carbon atoms. This chapter also contains results from ab-initio restricted Hartree Fock calculations in a simplistic geometry where a nanotube is surrounded by two concentric rings of ions. The ab-initio calculation results suggest that the dominant contribution to the strain developed in the nanotubes originates from the electrostatic interactions between the ions and the delocalized π electrons as compared to the doping effects. PART 2 Chapter 6 : Raman scattering in CaFeO 3 and La 0. 33 Sr 0. 67 FeO 3 across the charge disproportionation phase transition Temperature dependent micro-Raman studies of orthorhombic CaFeO 3 and rhombohedral La 0. 33 Sr 0. 67 FeO 3 were carried out with an aim to study the role of phonons in the formation of the charge disproportioned state (Fe 4 + → Fe 5 ++Fe 3 +) below the transition temperature (Tco) of 290 K and 200 K, respectively. Shell model lattice dynamics calculations were performed for CaFeO 3 to assign the Raman modes and determine their vibrational pattern. Temperature dependence of the peak positions and peak widths of various modes for both the systems show distinct changes across their respective transition temperatures. In CaFeO 3 the symmetric stretching mode at 707 cm− 1 splits into two modes, 707 cm− 1 and 684 cm− 1. Interestingly, the 707 (684) cm− 1 mode appears only in HH(HV) polarization. In comparison, the Raman band at 704 cm− 1 in La 0. 33 Sr 0. 67 FeO 3 which has been assigned to the Raman forbidden symmetric stretching mode, disappears below Tco. In addition, two modes at 307 cm− 1 and 380 cm− 1 of La 0. 33 Sr 0. 67 FeO 3 approach each other at Tco. Our experiments show that for both the systems, CaFeO 3 and La 0. 33 Sr 0. 67 FeO 3, the lattice distortion changes across Tco.

It also contains possible future studies which are worth pursuing to add further insights in the issues addressed...|$|E
5|$|Arboreal animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. <b>Frictional</b> <b>gripping</b> is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|R

Eighty-nine children and 15 adults lifted an instrumented object with exchangeable grip surfaces measuring the grip and load forces.

50|$|Prior to the {{foundation}} of <b>Frictional</b> Games, Thomas <b>Grip</b> and Jens Nilsson had been working as freelance artist and musician, respectively, and having never worked professionally in the video game industry, where both had only minor backgrounds in programming. In 1999, started developing freeware games under the name GripDesign, creating Fiend (2001) and Energetic (2005). For the development of Energetic and a unreleased title named Unbirth, Grip worked together with Nilsson as the games' sound designer, and in 2006, the two agreed to join forces, officially founding Frictional Games on 1 January 2007. The team set out {{to create a new}} survival horror project, starting by developing their own game engine that would eventually become the first iteration of the HPL Engine. Built upon this engine they made Penumbra, a tech demo to display the engine's capabilities, which later evolved into their first game, Penumbra: Overture, which they released in partnership with Paradox Interactive on 30 March 2007, and was followed its sequel, Penumbra: Black Plague, as well as its expansion, Penumbra: Requiem, in 2008. The series was heavily inspired by the Silent Hill series, however, aimed to achieve an equal or higher level of fright, without employing puzzle or action techniques, that the serie's games prominently used, and rather focusing solely on the scarines aspect. The series in total was a financial success, but not the result Frictional Games had hoped to produce, with the game incorporating a lot of issues, Frictional Games holds the publisher, Paradox Interactive, responsible for.|$|R
