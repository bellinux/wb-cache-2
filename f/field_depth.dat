50|$|The {{concepts}} of the two definitions of hyperfocal distance have a long history, tied up with the terminology for depth of <b>field,</b> <b>depth</b> of focus, circle of confusion, etc. Here are some selected early quotations and interpretations on the topic.|$|E
5000|$|Deep {{focus is}} a {{photographic}} and cinematographic technique using a large depth of <b>field.</b> <b>Depth</b> of field is the front-to-back range of focus in an image — that is, {{how much of}} it appears sharp and clear. In deep focus the foreground, middle-ground and background are all in focus.|$|E
50|$|The {{area of the}} Sirte Basin {{occupies}} about 230,000 km², with a wildcat drilling {{density of}} one new field wildcat per 145 km². Overall drilling density of the basin is 3.3 wells per 100 km², with an average <b>field</b> <b>depth</b> of 2,100 m. Recent indications of hydrocarbons within grabens suggest that these areas have potential as well as clastic reservoirs beneath the carbonate reservoirs in the Central Sirte Basin. The offshore area beyond 200 m depths is largely unexplored.|$|E
50|$|As the <b>field's</b> <b>depth</b> {{increases}} it will potentially allow {{society to}} control and harness more of what the brain does and how it influences lifestyles and personalities. Commonplace technologies already attempt to do this; games like BrainAge, and programs like Fast ForWord that aim to improve brain function, are neurotechnologies.|$|R
50|$|The same {{factors that}} {{determine}} <b>depth</b> of <b>field</b> also determine <b>depth</b> of focus, but these factors can have different effects {{than they have}} in <b>depth</b> of <b>field.</b> Both <b>depth</b> of <b>field</b> and <b>depth</b> of focus increase with smaller apertures. For distant subjects (beyond macro range), depth of focus is relatively insensitive to focal length and subject distance, for a fixed f-number. In the macro region, depth of focus increases with longer focal length or closer subject distance, while <b>depth</b> of <b>field</b> decreases.|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{techniques}} such as light field, structured il-lumination, and time-of-flight (TOF) are commonly used for depth acquisition in consumer imaging, robotics and many other applications. Unfortunately, each technique suffers from its individual limitations preventing robust depth sens-ing. In this paper, we explore {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of combining light field and time-of-flight imaging, particu-larly the feasibility of an on-chip implementation as a single hybrid depth sensor. We refer to this combination as <b>depth</b> <b>field</b> imaging. <b>Depth</b> <b>fields</b> combine light field advantages such as synthetic aperture refocusing with TOF imaging ad-vantages such as high depth resolution and coded signal processing to resolve multipath interference. We show ap-plications including synthesizing virtual apertures for TOF imaging, improved depth mapping through partial and scat-tering occluders, and single frequency TOF phase unwrap-ping. Utilizing space, angle, and temporal coding, <b>depth</b> <b>fields</b> can improve <b>depth</b> sensing in the wild and generate new insights into the dimensions of light’s plenoptic func-tion. 1...|$|R

50|$|When {{a camera}} lens is focused to project an object some {{distance}} away onto the film or detector, the objects that are closer in distance, relative to the distant object, are also approximately in focus. The range of distances that are nearly in focus is called the depth of <b>field.</b> <b>Depth</b> of field generally increases with decreasing aperture diameter (increasing f-number). The unfocused blur outside the depth of field is sometimes used for artistic effect in photography. The subjective appearance of this blur is known as bokeh.|$|E

40|$|Although it {{has been}} {{reported}} that <b>depth</b> of <b>field</b> influences <b>depth</b> perception in nonstereo photographs, it remains unclear how <b>depth</b> of <b>field</b> affects <b>depth</b> perception under stereo viewing conditions. We showed participants stereo photographs with different <b>depths</b> of <b>field</b> using a Wheatstone stereoscope and a commercially available 3 D TV. The depicted scene contained a floor, a background, and a measuring probe at different locations. Participants drew a floor plan of the depicted scene to scale. We found that perceived depth decreased with decreasing <b>depth</b> of <b>field</b> for shallow <b>depths</b> of <b>field</b> in scenes containing a heightin-the-field cue. For larger <b>depths</b> of <b>field,</b> different effects were found depending on the display system and the viewing distance. There was no effect on perceived depth using the 3 D TV, but perceived depth decreased with increasing <b>depth</b> of <b>field</b> using the Wheatstone stereoscope. However, in the 3 D TV case, we found that the perceived depth decreased with increasing <b>depth</b> of <b>field</b> in scenes in which the height-in-the-field cue was removed. This indicates that the effect of <b>depth</b> of <b>field</b> on perceived <b>depth</b> may be influenced by other depth cues in the scene, such as height-in-the-field cues...|$|R
40|$|This work {{proposes a}} new image fusion method that is well suited for merging angle {{information}} and extending the <b>field</b> of <b>depth</b> of Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopic images. Many other extend <b>field</b> of <b>depth</b> methods only regularize their solution in a small neighborhood. Such approaches are not suitable for DIC images where reliable depth estimates are only possible at cell walls, which are sparse in the overall images. Therefore, we developed a novel fusion method that first accurately estimates {{the depth of the}} cell layer of interest and in a second step extends the <b>field</b> of <b>depth</b> using this depth estimation. The proposed method only fuses information specifically linked to the epidermal cell layer of Arabidopsis leaves, thus avoiding clutter related to underlying cell layers. In addition, our method fuses images with different shear angles, thus overcoming the lack of contrast in certain directions intrinsic for DIC microscopy. By both improving the focal depth and contrast, the proposed method is a useful step towards fully automated analysis of the cellular content of the leaf's epidermal cell layer...|$|R

50|$|This {{effect is}} often {{incorrectly}} {{thought of as}} increasing the depth of <b>field.</b> <b>Depth</b> of field depends on the focal length, aperture, and subject distance. As long as the photographer wants sharpness in a plane that {{is parallel to the}} film, tilt is of no use. However, tilt has a strong effect on the depth of field by drastically altering its shape, making it asymmetrical. Without tilt, the limits of near and far acceptable focus are parallel to the plane of sharp focus as well as parallel to the film. With forward tilt, the plane of sharp focus tilts even more and the near and far limits of acceptable focus form a wedge shape (viewed from the side). Thus, the lens still sees a cone shaped portion of whatever is in front of it while the wedge of acceptable focus is now more closely aligned with this cone. Therefore, depending on the shape of the subject, a wider aperture can be used, lessening concerns about camera stability due to slow shutter speed and diffraction due to too-small aperture.|$|E

First, the salient characteristic features of two canonical localized wave solutions to the scalar wave equation are discussed.

The choice of an adequate relationship (here, {{a variant of the}} Vollenweider's (1965) expression), the properties of such a formula, and the relevant parameters are discussed in the paper.
