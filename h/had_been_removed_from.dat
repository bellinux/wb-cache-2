5|$|In March 2015 {{the team}} {{confirmed}} that Riis <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> active duty due to differences between Riis and Tinkov. Media reports had initially indicated that Riis had been suspended {{when he did}} not appear at the 2015 Milan–San Remo as planned, and that this was due to a disappointing start to the season for the team. His departure from the team was officially announced on 29 March.|$|E

5|$|The {{proposal}} to extend SR 125 north into Poway was discussed {{as late as}} 2003 by a local advisory group working with the San Diego Association of Governments. The City of Poway opposed the plan in 2001, saying that SR 67 should be improved instead; it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> city plans in 1980. None of these proposals to extend SR 125 {{have been included in}} SANDAG's 2050 Regional Transportation Plan.|$|E
5|$|By late 1940 Naujocks <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> his {{position}} after he {{fell out of}} favour with Heydrich. The counterfeiting unit continued under Langer before he left in early 1942 at which point it closed down; he later stated that over 18 months, the unit had produced around £3 million in forged notes; the historian Anthony Pirie puts the figure at £500,000. Most of the currency produced in Operation Andreas was never used.|$|E
5|$|In 1646, when Qing armies led by Bolo {{had entered}} the city of Fuzhou, they had found envoys from the Ryūkyū Kingdom, Annam, and the Spanish in Manila. These {{tributary}} embassies {{that had come to}} see the now fallen Longwu Emperor of the Southern Ming were forwarded to Beijing, and eventually sent home with instructions about submitting to the Qing. The King of the Ryūkyū Islands sent his first tribute mission to the Qing in 1649, Siam in 1652, and Annam in 1661, after the last remnants of Ming resistance <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> Yunnan, which bordered Annam.|$|E

5|$|In 1992 {{an attempt}} was made to extract a {{mitochondrial}} DNA sequence from the skeletal remains of C.d.guildayi to compare its relationship to other Canis species. The attempt was unsuccessful because these remains <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the LaBrea pits and tar could not be removed from the bone material. In 2014 an attempt to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth from the tar pits also failed, with the study concluding that organic compounds from the asphalt permeate the bones of all ancient samples from the LaBrea pits, hindering the extraction of DNA samples.|$|E
5|$|Morrow also demanded {{consistency}} {{from local}} law enforcement officials. In 1921, he removed the Woodford County jailer from office because he allowed a black inmate to be lynched and offered a reward of $25,000 {{for information leading to}} the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators. Citizens of Versailles were more outraged that the jailer <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> office than that the prisoner had been lynched. The locals refused to aid in the investigation, and the lynchers were never arrested or charged. Local officials appointed the jailer's wife to finish his term in an attempt to skirt the removal.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt and Virgil Earp and Doc Holliday {{believed}} that Tom had a revolver {{at the time}} of the gunfight. Wyatt thought Tom fired a revolver under the horse's neck and believed until he died that Tom's revolver <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the scene by Wesley Fuller. Witness Fallehy wrote that he saw Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday shooting at a man who was using a horse to barricade himself, and once shot the man fell. In his statement, Fallehy wrote that the man still held his pistol in his hand. Although he did not see him shoot, he thought Tom McLaury was armed.|$|E

5|$|About a {{month after}} the race concluded, reports began {{surfacing}} which stated that Giro director Angelo Zomegnan was going to be ousted from that position. Though praised for his delicate handling of Weylandt's death, Zomegnan's handling of the teams' protest of and eventual removal of the Monte Crostis from the Giro race route was seen much less approvingly. A further month later, RCS Sport, owners of the race, confirmed that Zomegnan <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> his largely autocratic position as race director. He was replaced by RCS general director Michele Acquarone and Mauro Vegni, along with a team of former professional riders. Zomegnan remains as an RCS consultant and director of the 2013 UCI Road World Championships in Florence. Zomegnan had held the position since 2004, beginning with the 2005 Giro d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|By 01:10 hours, {{the western}} {{flank of the}} Mousetrap had fallen to Viet Minh bombardment. By 01:30, the {{garrison}} was informed that weather conditions prevented air support, and by 02:30 the Viet Minh forces launched successive assault waves which overran Teullier and his men, including attacks which flanked the position using the nearby sandbanks. At the same time, Alpha was overrun by Viet Minh forces, and by 03:50 no more firing was heard from the Mousetrap. Alpha survived {{the remainder of the}} night and was seen fighting by French aircraft at 09:00 that morning. C-47 transport aircraft returned to resume supply drops, however by 12:00 the Tricolor and the Laotian flag <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> Pi’s command bunker.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, demand for pennies was falling in Britain, {{likely due to}} the {{popularity}} of the lighter, more convenient, brass threepence coin. which weighed {{less than a quarter of}} the same value in bronze coins. The immediate aftermath of the war had seen a strong demand for pennies until January 1949, when it dropped off, and in May of that year, the Royal Mint stopped the coin's production. Officials concluded that the fall in demand was permanent due to inflation; its purchasing power was minimal, and many automatic machines no longer took it. The Royal Mint redeemed surplus coppers from the banks for melting beginning in 1951, and by the end of the decade, some £1.2 million worth <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> circulation.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, as {{a result}} of the October Revolution, Russia became a {{communist}} state. In the aftermath of World War I, Poland reemerged as an independent country in the following year. From 1919 to 1921, the two states fought the Polish–Soviet War which was concluded with the Peace of Riga. Article 11 of the peace treaty required that the Soviet side return all culturally significant collections and items that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> Poland since the First Partition in 1772. A special bilateral committee was set up to carry out the restitution of cultural goods. In 1928, the committee's efforts resulted in the return to Poland of, among other national treasures, Szczerbiec, which, after 133 years, was deposited back in the Wawel Castle.|$|E

Later that month it was announced that Riis' contract had been terminated with the agreement of both parties. Subsequently the team revealed its new management structure, with Riis' former duties being carried out by new general manager Stefano Feltrin and Steven de Jongh, who was promoted to the role of head sport director.|$|E
5|$|On 7 December, Pellew agreed formal {{terms for}} the {{surrender}} of Revolutie, Pluto, Kortenaar and the Dutch East Indiaman Rustloff that were anchored in Griessie. However, when British boats entered the harbour {{it was discovered that}} Cowell had issued orders for all four ships to be scuttled, their wrecks protruding from the shallow water. Unable to remove the ships, Pellew ordered their remains burnt, while British landing parties spread throughout the town, burning the military stores and destroying the cannon that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the ship. Another landing party took possession of the remains of the battery at Sambelangan and demolished it. British operations were complete by 11 December and Pellew then ordered the squadron to withdraw and return to India.|$|E

5|$|The {{gasoline}} {{fires that}} flared up around Turret 1 {{might have caused}} more critical damage if the main magazines had not been empty. For several days prior to the attack, all of the 14-inch-gun (356mm) battleships had been replacing their standard-weight main battery projectiles with a new heavier projectile that offered greater penetration and a larger explosive charge {{in exchange for a}} slight decrease in range. All of the older projectiles and powder charges <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the magazines of Nevada, and the crew had taken a break after loading the new projectiles in anticipation of loading the new powder charges on Sunday.|$|E
5|$|The {{road that}} is {{currently}} SH-34C first appeared on the 1948 state highway map as SH-15A. At this time, the highway began at US-183/US-270/SH-15/SH-34 in Woodward and headed north, then turned east {{north of the city}} and headed to Boiling Springs State Park. When SH-34 was realigned north of Woodward on November 1, 1954, it took over the portion of SH-15A in Woodward, severing the highway's link to its parent. SH-15A had been renumbered as SH-34C by 1956. By 1957, the highway was extended east, passing through the park and continuing onward to SH-50. However, by 1959, the road through the park <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the state highway system; the segment of highway east of the park was renumbered to SH-50B.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{coaching}} changes {{came about}} a month after the Orange Bowl. On February 14, the school announced that the son of head coach Frank Beamer, Shane Beamer, had been hired as running backs coach. He replaced Billy Hite, the longest-tenured assistant coach in the country, who took an administrative role with the team. Two days later, Tech replaced 62-year-old linebackers coach Jim Cavanaugh with 35-year-old Cornell Brown. On February 22, Tech announced that offensive coordinator Bryan Stinespring <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> play-calling duties and replaced by quarterbacks coach Mike O'Cain. Stinespring, who also was the team's associate head coach, was replaced in that capacity by Shane Beamer.|$|E
