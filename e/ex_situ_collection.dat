Some morphological measurements discriminated among cultivated types. The analysis of 62 polymorphic bands obtained with two AFLP primer combinations indicated that the three cultivated bean types were comparable in terms of molecular diversity and that no pattern of variation was associated with geographical distribution. However, a multiple correspondence analysis with the same molecular data detected different genetic groups. Three of these groups included all the cultivated accessions collected from home gardens, but could not be explained by the seed descriptors. The results therefore suggest that a scientifically sound collecting strategy to recover the former Cuban ex situ gene bank should consider combining geographical, morphological, and molecular data. The findings also suggest that any proposed methodologies should be considered before developing a conservation strategy based on an ex situ or combined ex situ and in situ approaches.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The wild {{relatives}} of crops represent {{a major source}} of valuable traits for crop improvement. These resources are threatened by habitat destruction, land use changes, and other factors, requiring their urgent collection and long-term availability for research and breeding from <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collections.</b> We propose a method to identify gaps in <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collections</b> (i. e. gap analysis) of crop wild relatives as a means to guide efficient and effective collecting activities. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The methodology prioritizes among taxa based on a combination of sampling, geographic, and environmental gaps. We apply the gap analysis methodology to wild taxa of the Phaseolus genepool. Of 85 taxa, 48 (56. 5 %) are assigned high priority for collecting due to lack of, or under-representation, in genebanks, 17 taxa are given medium priority for collecting, 15 low priority, and 5 species are assessed as adequately represented in <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collections.</b> Gap "hotspots", representing priority target areas for collecting, are concentrated in central Mexico, although the narrow endemic nature of a suite of priority species adds a number of specific additional regions to spatial collecting priorities. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Results of the gap analysis method mostly align very well with expert opinion of gaps in <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collections,</b> with only a few exceptions. A more detailed prioritization of taxa and geographic areas for collection can be achieved by including in the analysis predictive threat factors, such as climate change or habitat destruction, or by adding additional prioritization filters, such as the degree of relatedness to cultivated species (i. e. ease of use in crop breeding). Furthermore, results for multiple crop genepools may be overlaid, which would allow a global analysis of gaps in <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collections</b> of the world's plant genetic resources...|$|R

By associating records of graftwood origin with previous inventories, the line of descent can be traced from the present collection, through the valid evaluation records obtained from previous inventories, back to the ortet, or founding source of the cultivar.

40|$|Ex situ {{conservation}} in germplasm and living collections {{is a major}} focus of global plant conservation strategies. Prioritizing species for <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collection</b> is a necessary component of this effort for which sound strategies are needed. Phylogenetic considerations can {{play an important role in}} prioritization. Collections that are more phylogenetically diverse are likely to encompass more ecological and trait variation, and thus provide stronger {{conservation in}}surance and richer resources for future restoration efforts. However, phylogenetic criteria need to be weighed against other, potentially competing objectives. We used <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collection</b> and threat rank data for North American angiosperms to investigate gaps in ex situ coverage and phylogenetic diversity of collections and to develop a flexible framework for prioritizing species across multiple objectives. We found that ex situ coverage of 18, 766 North American angiosperm taxa was low with respect to the most vulnerable taxa: just 43 % of vulnerable to critically imperiled taxa were in ex situ collections, far short of a year- 2020 goal of 75 %. In addition, species held in ex situ collections were phylogenetically clustered (P < 0. 001), i. e., collections comprised less phylogenetic diversity than would be expected had species been drawn at random. These patterns support incorporating phylogenetic considerations into ex situ prioritization in a manner balanced with other criteria, such as vulnerability. To meet this need, we present the 'PIECES' index (Phylogenetically Informed Ex situ Conservation of Endangered Species). PIECES integrates phylogenetic considerations into a flexible framework for prioritizing species across competing objectives using multi-criteria decision analysis. Applying PIECES to prioritizing ex situ conservation of North American angiosperms, we show strong return on investment across multiple objectives, some of which are negatively correlated with each other. A spreadsheet-based decision support tool for North American angiosperms is provided; this tool can be customized to align with different conservation objectives...|$|E

Botanical gardens {{play a key role}} in conservation of plant diversity, and as is stated in Target 8 of the GSPC, at least 75 % of threatened plant species should be present in <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collections.</b> However, only about 30 % of globally threatened plant species are currently held in living collections. These have to be genetically representative, but information about the genetic diversity present in such collections is scarce, although it is estimated that diversity is low in numerous species. Moreover, besides the many studies and initiatives for specific taxa, our knowledge about genetic diversity of threatened plant species in general is quite restricted. This lack of insight in genetic diversity of threatened plant species heavily contrasts with the broad knowledge about crops and their wild relatives. We still have a long way to go to study genetic diversity in threatened plants, conserve an important part of this diversity in <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collections,</b> define which percentage of genetic diversity might be feasible and/or desirable to aim for, and finally make this available for conservation and restoration projects. Within this specific project at Ghent University, we aim to compare genetic diversity between wild populations and <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collections</b> of three distantly related Angiosperm groups with different life histories and growth forms. A range of genomic tools (barcoding, microsatellites, AFLP, RAD sequencing) will be applied to wild and <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> individuals of selected species of the flagship groups Hydrangea, Magnolia and Cactaceae to enable rapid characterization of genetic variation, providing 1) support of specific conservation actions, and 2) general guidelines and a protocol on genetic management for acquiring accessions for <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collections,</b> to be used by collectors and botanical gardens worldwide in the framework of achievement of Target 8 of the GSPC...|$|R

40|$|Worldwide {{about one}} third of all plant species is {{estimated}} to be threatened with extinction. Plants are generally under-represented in conservation. However, the global strategy for plant conservation (GSPC) sets forth 16 targets to halt the current and continuing loss of plant diversity within a framework for actions at global, regional, national and local levels. Target 8 of the GSPC directs that at least 75 % of threatened plant species be present in ex situ collections by 2020, but this target is far from being met.

40|$|A {{national}} {{inventory of}} UK {{plant genetic resources}} carried out in 2003 - 4 covered surveys and documentation of landrace types, occurrences and threats. Among the local varieties found, those with longest histories of local cultivation occurred on the most remote Scottish islands: the Outer Hebrides and Tiree had bere (Hordeum vulgare L.), Small oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.) and rye (Secale cereale L.); bere and Small oat on Orkney and Shetland; and Shetland cabbage (B. olearacea L.) on Shetland. These landraces are not only geographically but also agriculturally marginal; they are confined to crofting agriculture and used in low-intensity pastoralism. Two of these, the oat and the cabbage, were chosen for a characterization study which formed the major part of this PhD thesis. The broad aims of the characterization study were first, to describe the existing diversity within Scotland; to document the <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collection</b> of Scottish landraces; to better understand genetic structure and dynamics of the landraces; but also to explore {{the use of a}} characterization study to raise awareness about landraces. Morphological and microsatellite results showed distinct identities for both landraces in relation to the respective outgroups; in the oat distinct regional identities were found. High diversity was found, most of the genetic variation however, was within populations, for both inbreeder (oat) and outbreeder (cabbage). This can be attributed to frequent and widespread seed exchange and seed swapping within island groups, while the small but significant regional distinctness is maintained through isolation between the three islands groups. The morphological characterization of Small oats was carried out in situ, on a croft in the Southern Outer Hebrides, aiming at education and raising awareness about landraces among secondary school students, maintainers and the local public in general. The extension and education element of the study seemed useful in raising the issue of landraces locally. Carrying out the trial in the area of origin and amidst maintainers had the additional advantage of identifying and communicating with stakeholders groups. Integrated conservation of <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collection</b> and maintainers has been achieved through the Scottish Landrace Protection Scheme. By retaining the link between landraces and maintainers during the characterization, a springboard may have been created for feedback of the genetic results into the local seed system and to discuss further support options for landraces and maintainers...|$|E
40|$|Maintaining living <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collections</b> {{is one of}} the key {{conservation}} {{methods in}} botanic gardens worldwide. Despite of the existence of many other conservation approaches used nowadays, it offers for many endangered plants an important insurance policy for the future, especially for rare and threatened relict trees. The aim of this research was to investigate the global extent of living <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collections,</b> to assess and discuss their viability and inform the development of conservation approaches that respond to latest global conservation challenges. We used as a model taxon the tree genus Zelkova (Ulmaceae). The genus includes six prominent Tertiary relict trees which survived the last glaciation in disjunct and isolated refugial regions. Our comprehensive worldwide survey shows that the majority of botanic institutions with Zelkova collections are in countries with a strong horticultural tradition and not in locations of their origin. More importantly, the acutely threatened Zelkova species are not the most represented in collections, and thus safeguarded through <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> conservation. Less than 20 % of the <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collections</b> surveyed contain plant material of known wild provenance while the majority (90 %) of collections are generally very small (1 – 10 trees). Botanic gardens and arboreta particularly in regions where iconic relict trees naturally occur should play a vital role in the conservation of these species. The coordination of conservation efforts between gardens has to be enhanced to prioritise action for the most threatened relict trees.

Although a higher percentage of living accessions of Copiapoa, Eriosyce and Eulychnia in <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collections</b> are of known wild origin com- pared to results of previous studies on other plant groups, the number of available accessions is insufficient to adequately preserve the genetic diversity of the threatened species.

These method allows the storage of many individuals and have high potential for reintroduction. Since this method allows for storage of a high number of individuals, it maximizes genetic diversity. Once collected, the material can last for relatively long periods in storage.However some species lose viability when stored as seed. However tissue culture and cryopreservation techniques have only been perfected for a few species.Organisms may also be kept in living collections. Living collections are more costly than storing germplasm and hence can support {{only a fraction of the}} individuals that <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> sourcing can. When sourcing for living collections, the risks increase. There are fewer individuals so loss of genetic diversity becomes a concern. The individuals may also become adapted to captivity so efforts should be made to replicate wild conditions and time spent in captivity should be minimized whenever possible.|$|R

This process is of particular concern in minor circum-Sicilian islands, because of the sharp reduction of the cultivated surfaces and the shift of their economy from agriculture to tourism. Aiming at valorising and preserving the surviving varieties we collected 185 accessions during several surveys since 2007. Six nuclear microsatellite markers were used for germplasm characterization, yielding 75 different genetic profiles. We found out that most genetic profiles (39) were not listed in national and international grapevine databases, confirming that the Sicilian minor islands represent underexplored hotspots of genetic diversity for grapevine. We also identified several synonymies, often due to geographic isolation, having 20 varieties at least two names. Conversely, 18 homonyms collectively indicated 34 genetically different accessions. Interviews with farmers provided information on current and past usage, and the origin and type of cultivation practices as well. The study also shows {{the urgent need for}} preservation of local grapevine germplasm, due to the disappearance of the elder caretakers of these traditional varieties.

The non-significant correlation between genetic and physical distances (Mantel test; r = - 0. 075) revealed a random distribution of genotypes in the natural stand. When the juvenile set was divided in 17 subsets, based on maternal provenance and growing conditions, Shannon's index (54 %) and AMOVA analysis (84 %) indicated that most of genetic variation resides within subsets.

40|$|Allozyme {{electrophoresis}} {{was used}} {{to determine the extent of}} clonality in four naturally occurring populations of Acanthocladium dockeri F. Muell. from the mid-north of South Australia. A total of 33 loci was scored for at least 16 plants from each population. The four known populations of A. dockeri represent four quite distinct genetic clones. Each natural population consists of a single genet, and no indication of any correlation between geographical proximity and genetic similarity was found. Seed set in flowers was very low (0. 6 % of florets), probably owing to low pollen germinability. Seedlings raised from A. dockeri seed collected at Hart displayed obvious genetic affinities to their parent, but were nevertheless genetically distinct. Differences were consistent with the derivation of this seed by selfing of the Hart genet. A. dockeri is considered at high risk of extinction because of its low genetic diversity, poor seed production, lack of seedling recruitment and population growth by clonal reproduction alone. On the basis of the outcomes of this research, the following recommendations for conservation management of A. dockeri are made: (1) all four extant genets should be preserved in their respective habitats; (2) at least one <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collection</b> of all four extant genets should be maintained at a secure site as an insurance against population loss; (3) further surveys are required to potentially locate new populations with superior fertility; and (4) mixing of clones or seed provenances into a single population should be avoided until appropriately designed experimental translocations have evaluated the possible consequences of such mixing on competitive, reproductive and genetic responses of populations.

40|$|This study {{reports the}} results of our efforts to create a stable and {{vigorous}} collection of rare and endemic plants from the Pirin Mountains on a plot located at Dobrinishte village (the North-East foothills of the Pirin) from 2005 to 2008. Some threatened plants from the Pirin Mountains well known for their medicinal properties were included in the <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collection.</b> Here we share our observations on the pre-adaptation of adult plants and our experience in growing seedlings. Adult plants were transplanted from their native populations in the summer of 2005 and they developed amazingly well. A total of 88. 2 % of the transplants survived until the next season and 31. 7 % of the survivals bloomed the next year. Many of these set seed for the following seasons. Good germination and early stage development was observed for Leontopodium alpinum but later many of the young seedlings did not survive. Linum capitatum demonstrated poor germination without treatment other than stratification. Good germination occurred in Sideritis scardica, Stachys recta, after treatment with gibberellic acid. Germination of Hypericum linarioides was poor. In total 462 seedlings of the studied plant species were prepared for planting in the garden. The seedlings at the 2 - 6 true leaf stage, were transported to Dobrinishte village and planted singly into the flower beds with fine marble gravel top-dressing (up to 1 cm size). Most transplanted seedling survived the first summer. Although the number of survivals gradually decreased each following year and the critical points were mainly winters seed grown plants bloomed and set seed next seasons. Thus seed was collected for the next year from the flower beds, rather than from nature...|$|E
40|$|The negramina (Siparuna guianensis Aublet) {{belonging}} to the family Siparunaceae, is a species widely used in Mato Grosso, Brazil, as a bath for treatment of flu, headache, rheumatism and "malina", but {{little is known about}} their breeding and domestication. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the phenology of the species to determine the intensities of the fall foliage in the canopy, budding, flowering and fruiting in order to support the best time to collect seeds and cuttings for ex situ breeding. The phenological aspects of S. guianensis were obtained through observation biweekly 40 individuals in two areas of environmental conservation located in Cuiaba-MT, between August 2007 and July 2009. The region presents a clear seasonal climate with two distinct seasons: a dry (autumn-winter) and rainy (spring-summer), and 70 % of the average annual precipitation from 1250 to 1500 mm occurs between November and March. We analyzed the activity indices, intensity and synchrony to the phenological events in relation to climatic seasonality. It was concluded that in both places the behavior of S. guianensis had similar patterns, being an evergreen species, with greater loss of leaves during the dry season, his shooting occurred throughout the year, with peak activity and intensity at the end of the rainy season, there was intense flowering in the transition between the dry and rainy, and the fruiting period occurred only during the rainy season. For the flowering phenophase there was a high synchrony between individuals from both locations. It is suggested for breeding <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collection</b> of cuttings at the end of the rainy season, time of intense vegetative growth, and the seeds during the rainy season...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} the effects of climate change on plant distributions in situ has made the appropriate application of <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> techniques more crucial. These <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> conservation techniques need to be targeted to priority species identified at risk from climate change. The present paper assesses the sensitivity of plant species to climate change in Belgium and explores the current conservation status of those species potentially vulnerable to climate change. We then checked whether these species were included in <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collections.</b> The whole Belgian flora has been assessed (a total of 1, 396 native plant species). We evaluated whether each of these species occurs in a "climate change-vulnerable" habitat, having therefore a higher probability to be impacted by climate change. The assessment revealed that there are at least 415 native plant species (30 % of the Belgian native flora) that appear to be vulnerable to climate change during the next decades. Results also showed that about one-third of the species currently included in the red list may have their situation made potentially worse due to climate change. In addition, depending on the region, between 45 and 67 % of the species that are currently not threatened in Belgium are likely to become so due to climate change. It also appeared that only 32 % of these climate change-vulnerable species are currently held <b>ex</b> <b>situ.</b> We conclude {{that there is a need}} to identify gaps in existing <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collections</b> as an urgent priority and ensure that species potentially vulnerable to climate change are conserved <b>ex</b> <b>situ.</b> © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a novel approach}} for conservation of endangered plant species in which <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>collections</b> maintained in natural or semi-natural environment {{are a part of}} a complementary <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> – in situ conservation strategy. We provide detailed guidelines for 1) representative sampling of the populations; 2) collection maintenance; and 3) utilization for in situ actions. Our approach is the first that explicitly takes into account ecologically significant (i. e. adaptive) variation of plants in both <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> and in situ conservation actions. We propose that {{an important part of the}} conservation strategy is preserving both neutral and adaptive genetic diversity through a quasi in situ conservation approach. Finally, we demonstrate this approach using a critically endangered plant species, Iris atrofusca from the northern Negev, Israel...|$|R
