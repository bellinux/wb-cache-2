5|$|In mid-2005 Barrales {{began looking}} for musicians for the band, asking friends of his {{to see if they}} could {{recommend}} anyone, which is how he heard of guitarist Alex Lee. When Barrales saw Lee play, he dropped the thought of trying to play rhythm guitar himself because he had a fear of not being able to keep up. There were a few years that Lee was playing guitar, but he was already playing along to music by Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Rusty Cooley, Paul Gilbert and Michael Angelo Batio. Lee decided to join Barrales, and together, they went on searching until they found themselves the drummer Carlos Regalado, who was known locally by playing covers of Megadeth and Metallica. With Regalado in the band, he helped to find bassist Ruben Dominguez. The band was impressed with the skills of Dominguez, who soon joined the band completing its line-up. The band then decided to name themselves after Exodus' Bonded by Blood, an album they <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> in their collection, even though their music tastes differed.|$|E

25|$|Ranetti and the traditionalists <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> {{a mutual}} dislike for the Francization and aristocratic pretense of fin de siècle Romanian culture. This hostility seeped into rhyming letters sent by Ranetti to his self-exiled friend Caragiale, {{and then into}} a topical volume, the 1904 Franțuzomania ("Frenchie-mania"). Also that year, he became the chief editor at Furnica ("The Ant"). It had been founded by him and Nae Dumitrescu Țăranu, son of a rich agriculturist. He would publish there under a host of pseudonyms, revisiting his Zeflemeaua ones, but also add more to the list: George Biciușcă, Caiafa, Coco, Contele de Techirghiol ("Count of Techirghiol"), Ghiță Delagambrinus (or the mock-aristocratic Lord Ghytza and Don Ghițos Delagambrinos y Mizilos), Netty, Ghiță Nifilistul, Sarsailă, Tovarășul Ghiță.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} how long the Nisan 14 {{practice}} continued. But both those who followed the Nisan 14 custom, and those who set Easter to the following Sunday <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> the custom of consulting their Jewish neighbors to learn when the month of Nisan would fall, and setting their festival accordingly. By the later 3rd century, however, some Christians began to express dissatisfaction with the custom of relying on the Jewish community to determine the date of Easter. The chief complaint was that the Jewish communities sometimes erred in setting Passover to fall before the Northern Hemisphere spring equinox. The Sardica paschal table confirms these complaints, for it indicates that the Jews of some eastern Mediterranean city (possibly Antioch) fixed Nisan 14 on dates well before the spring equinox on multiple occasions.|$|E

25|$|Born {{the son of}} a Jewish tailor in 1843/44 at Žemaičių Naumiestis, Lithuania (then - Russian Empire) Marks was {{endowed with}} integrity, courage, {{astonishing}} business acumen and immense vitality. He accompanied some horses to Sheffield in England while still a youth and, not wanting to return to the Jewish persecution in Russia, decided to stay on. It was in Sheffield that he met his future in-laws. Hearing news of the diamond discoveries in Kimberley, he arrived at the Cape in 1869 and was shortly followed by his cousin Isaac Lewis, also from Neustadt-Sugind, with whom he forged the enduring partnership of Lewis & Marks. Marks started his career as a peddler in the rural districts of the Cape, but soon headed for Kimberley where his rise to prosperity began. They made a modest living supplying goods to mines and diggers, and later branched into diamond trading. Moving to Pretoria in 1881 he gained the confidence of President Kruger and the government of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (ZAR). His friendship with Kruger became close and enduring and they <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>common</b> humble origins and a ready wit. Marks advised that Kruger build a railway line from Pretoria to Lourenço Marques.|$|E

[...] Over time, with assistance of teammates such as Pujols, Molina found his comfortable stance, sounder mechanics and adopted a line-drive style of swing that eliminated the dip and helped him hit fastballs with more authority.|$|E
