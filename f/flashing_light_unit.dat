5000|$|A monolight is a {{self-contained}} photographic <b>flash</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>unit</b> usually {{found in a}} studio. Each monolight has its own independent power source. [...] It {{does not depend on}} a centralized power supply as a [...] "pack and head" [...] system does. Monolights are also independently controlled: each has its own power settings and <b>light</b> output. [...] <b>Flash</b> power is predominantly measured by the industry in watt seconds, which is unit-equivalent to the joule.|$|R
50|$|The arcade cabinet {{was created}} {{to look like a}} police car, with a gas pedal, {{steering}} wheel and a siren button, complete with <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> atop the <b>unit.</b> The game's cartoonish visuals and sense of humor gained it positive reviews. However, the game was slightly criticized for its difficulty; the game's developers later admitted that a long development cycle had resulted in the gameplay growing more complicated than originally planned.|$|R
40|$|The NIST candela is {{maintained}} via standard photometers which have shown long-term stability better than 0. 1 % per year. The detector-based method has {{allowed us to}} reduce the uncertainties of calibrations and to expand the range of calibration capabilities. There have been several new developments in photometry at NIST. A high-illuminance calibration facility has been developed. Four temperature-controlled standard photometers, tested for linearity and effect of heat at high illuminances, are used with a high-pressure xenon arc source to provide the illuminance scale at levels up to 100 klx. A <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> photometric <b>unit</b> (lx·s) has been realized using four standard photometers equipped with current integrators and two independent methods. Calibration services for illuminance meters at high illuminance levels and flashing-light photometers are now available at NIST. On-going new projects include {{the development of a}} detector-based luminous flux calibration facility using a 2. 5 m integrating sphere, realization of the total spectral radiant flux scale, {{and the development of a}} reference spectroradiometer for colorimetry of displays. Calibration services are planned in these areas of photometry and colorimetry in the near future.

40|$|Movie {{directors}} and producers worldwide, {{in their quest}} to narrate a good story that warrants repeated audience viewing, use many cinematic elements to intensify and clarify the viewing experience. One such element that directors manipulate is lighting. In this paper we examine one aspect of <b>lighting,</b> namely <b>flashing</b> <b>lights,</b> and its role as an intensifier of dramatic effects in film. We present an algorithm for robust extraction of <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> and a simple mechanism to group detected <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> into <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> scenes and analyze the role of these segments in story narration. In addition, we demonstrate how <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> detection can improve the performance of shot-based video segmentation. Experiments on a number of video sequences extracted from real movies yields good results. Our technique detects 90. 4 % of <b>flashing</b> <b>lights.</b> The detected <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> correctly eliminates 92. 7 % of false cuts in these sequences. In addition, data support is compiled to demonstrate the association between <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> scenes and certain dramatic intensification events such as supernatural power, crisis or excitement. <br /...|$|R

5000|$|In {{configurations}} {{that include}} sequenced <b>flashing</b> <b>lights,</b> {{the lights are}} typically strobes mounted {{in front of the}} runway on its extended centerline. These <b>lights</b> <b>flash</b> in sequence, usually at a speed of two consecutive sequences per second, beginning with the light most distant from the runway and ending at the Decision Bar. RAIL are similar to sequenced <b>flashing</b> <b>lights,</b> except that they end where the white approach light bars begin. Sequenced <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> and RAIL do not extend past the Decision Bar to avoid distracting the pilot during the critical phase of transitioning from instrument to visual flight. [...] Sequenced <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> are sometimes colloquially called the rabbit or the running rabbit.|$|R

When approaching a crosswalk with an embedded pavement <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> system, drivers are more apt to slow down and yield to pedestrians than when drivers approach a crosswalk with another type of lighted warning device. Also, compared to a crosswalk with no warning device, drivers are more likely to slow down and yield to pedestrians when the embedded pavement <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> system is in place.|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{a new way}} to {{fabricate}} nanoporous TiO 2 photoanode by <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> is demonstrated. TiO 2 nanoparticles are sintered on FTO glass by <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> irradiation at room temperature in ambient condition, which is dramatically simple, ultrahigh speed and one-shot large area fabrication process compared to a conventional high temperature (120 °C) thermal sintering process. The effect of the <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> conditions (<b>flash</b> <b>light</b> energy, pulse numbers and pulse duration) on the nanostructures of sintered TiO 2 layer, was studied and discussed using several microscopic and spectroscopic characterization techniques such as SEM, FT-IR, XRD and XPS. The sintered TiO 2 photoanodes by <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> were used in DSSC and its performance were compared with that of DSSC fabricated by conventional thermal sintering process. It was found that a <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> sintered TiO 2 photoanode has efficiency which {{is similar to that of}} the thermal sintered photoanode. It is expected that the newly developed <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> sintering technique of TiO 2 nanoparticles would be a strong alternative to realize the room temperature and in-situ sintering of photoanode fabrication for outdoor solar cell fabrication.
