40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to design and construct a continuous solar absorption refrigeration machine. A solar heated ammonia-water refrigeration machine with 0. 111 kw cooling capacity was designed and built. It consists of five heat exchangers (generator, condenser, evaporator, absorber and solution heat exchanger),two pumps, two throttle valves, two cooling water tanks and solar collectors with storage tanks(two evacuated and two flat plate collectors). The refrigeration unit was set up on roof of the north building of Faculty of Engineering, Khartoum University. A series of experiments were carried out to evaluate {{the performance of the}} heat exchangers and the solar collector fields. Then the absorption machine was tested to validate the design procedure and to evaluate the impact of the system components on the overall performance of the refrigerating system. It was found that reduction of heat losses, increase of streams flow rates, increase of delivery temperature of the <b>evacuated</b> <b>collector</b> field and further optimization of the system components are necessary for better system performance...|$|E
40|$|New {{comparative}} tests {{on two different}} types of solar collectors are presented in this paper. A standard glazed flat plate collector and an evacuated tube collector are installed in parallel and tested at the same working conditions; the <b>evacuated</b> <b>collector</b> is a direct flow through type with external compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) reflectors. Efficiency in steady-state and quasi-dynamic conditions is measured following the standard EN 12975 - 2 and it is compared with the input/output curves measured for the whole day. The first purpose of the present work is the comparison of results in steady-state and quasi-dynamic test methods both for flat plate and evacuated tube collectors. Beside this, the objective is to characterize and to compare the daily energy performance of these two types of collectors. An effective mean for describing and analyzing the daily performance is the so called input/output diagram, in which the collected solar energy is plotted against the daily incident solar radiation. Test runs have been performed in several conditions to reproduce different conventional uses (hot water, space heating, solar cooling). Results are also presented in terms of daily efficiency versus daily average reduced temperature difference: this allows to represent the comparative characteristics of the two collectors when operating under variable conditions, especially with wide range of incidence angles...|$|E
40|$|Pakistan {{has been}} facing an {{unprecedented}} energy crisis {{since the last}} few years. The problem becomes more severe throughout the year. The current energy shortage crisis has badly hit Pakistan’s economy where hundreds of industries have closed {{due to lack of}} electricity to fulfil their requirements. The energy supply and demand gap has risen to 5000 MW [1] and is expected to rise considerably in the coming years as shown in Figure 1. Table 1 shows the existing installed power generation in Pakistan. Pakistan has a huge potential in renewable energy especially solar energy to fill this gap if utilized properly. Pakistan, being in the Sun Belt, is ideally located to take advantage of solar energy technologies. This energy source is widely distributed and abundantly available in the country. Pakistan receives 4. 45 - 5. 83 kWh/m 2 /day of global horizontal insolation as an annual mean value, with 5. 30 kWh/m 2 /day over most areas of the country [2, 3]. This minimum level of solar radiation (4. 45 kWh/m 2 /day) is higher than the world average of 3. 61 kWh/m 2 /day [4] which shows that Pakistan lies in an excellent solar belt range. Pakistan has six main insolation measuring stations, namely Karachi, Islamabad, Lahore, Quetta, Peshawar and Multan and 37 observatories distributed fairly well over the entire country, recording sunshine hours as shown in Table A in Appendix. From the sunshine hours data {{it can be seen that}} most of the cities mentioned receive more than 250 sunshine hours a month. 2006 energy policy has resulted in few practical steps taken for utilizing the abundantly available solar resource in Pakistan. A Solar Water Heating System has installed in a Leather Industry for first time in Pakistan. The system, using 400 m 2 <b>Evacuated</b> <b>Collector</b> tubes, provides heated water at 70 to 80 oC (at least 10 degree rise to the incoming water) to the already used boiler system, thus saving 33 % of the cost. The Project was funded by Higher Education Commission (HEC) under University-Industry Technological Support Program (UITSP). Solar water heating technology is relatively mature technology in Pakistan but its higher capital cost compared to conventional gas heaters has limited its use so far. This technology is widely recommended by a number of public sector organizations in northern mountains where natural gas is limited and difficult. The solar water heaters are now being commercially produced in the private sector. More than 2000 low cost solar cookers are used in Pakistan for cooking purposes. Similarly, solar dryers are used in Gilgit and Skardu (Northern part of Pakistan) to dry large quantities of fruits such as apricot and transport and sell them later in the urban areas, thus bringing economic prosperity to the area. Fresh water unavailability in large parts of Baluchistan, Sind and southern Punjab is a critical issue. Two solar desalination plants consisting of 240 sills each with a capacity of 6000 gallons of seawater/day have been operational at Gawadar in Baluchistan province. A number of such schemes are under active consideration by local governments in Baluchistan and Thar [5]. The need for constructing solar power plants has been realized both at federal and provincial governments. The government of Sindh recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with German company Azur Solar for building a 50 MW solar power plant at Dhabeji in District Thatta. The firm Azur Solar will initially set up a 60 kW solar power station to provide free electricity to backward 'goths' (Villages), schools and basic health centres of Badin. Both, technical and economical feasibility of a 50 MW solar thermal power plant using Stirling-Dish (SD) technology in Jacaobabad in Sindh Province of Pakistan is analysed in this chapter. The performance and environmental aspects of Stirling dish for power generation with and without solar energy is examined, discussed and compared. The solar data was collected from Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) of Pakistan and Life cycle cost analysis is performed to determine the economic feasibility of the solar thermal power plant. This study reveals that Jacobabad falls within the high solar energy belt and has minimum radiation energy of 4. 45 kWh/m 2 /day (which is higher than the world average of 3. 61 kWh/m 2 /day) to produce electricity, even during the low sunshine and cloudy days. The study concluded that solar thermal power plant in Pakistan is feasible using solar Stirling dish technology...|$|E

The numerical model has been developed by using the Matlab/Simulink environment and it allows to predict on a hourly basis the thermal energy collected by the solar panels, the inlet/outlet collector working fluid temperature, the pool water temperature and the system efficiency.

50|$|Flat-plate {{collectors}} usually {{lose more}} heat {{to the environment}} than evacuated tubes, as an increasing function of temperature. They are inappropriate for high temperature applications such as process steam production. <b>Evacuated</b> tube <b>collectors</b> have a lower absorber plate area to gross area ratio (typically 60-80% of gross area) compared to flat plates. Based on absorber plate area, most evacuated tube systems are more efficient per square meter than equivalent flat plate systems. This makes them suitable where roof space is limiting, for example where the number of occupants of a building {{is higher than the}} number of square metres of suitable and available roof space. In general, per installed square metre, evacuated tubes deliver marginally more energy when the ambient temperature is low (e.g. during winter) or when the sky is overcast. However even in areas without much sunshine and solar heat, some low cost flat plate collectors can be more cost efficient than <b>evacuated</b> tube <b>collectors.</b> Although several European companies manufacture <b>evacuated</b> tube <b>collectors,</b> the <b>evacuated</b> tube market is dominated by manufacturers in the East. Several Chinese companies have track records of 15-30 years. There is no unambiguous evidence that the two designs differ in long term reliability. However, evacuated tube technology is younger and (especially for newer variants with sealed heat pipes) still need to demonstrate competitive lifetimes. The modularity of evacuated tubes can be advantageous in terms of extensibility and maintenance, for example if the vacuum in one tube diminishes.|$|R

Many thermosiphon systems have comparable energy output to equivalent active systems. The efficiency of <b>evacuated</b> tube <b>collectors</b> is somewhat lower than for flat plate collectors because the absorbers are narrower than the tubes and the tubes have space between them, resulting in a significantly larger percentage of inactive overall collector area.

Relative efficiencies of the evacuated tube system are reduced however, when compared to flat plate collectors because the latter have a larger aperture size and can absorb more solar energy per unit area. This means that while an individual evacuated tube has better insulation (lower conductive and convective losses) due to the vacuum created inside the tube, an array of tubes found in a completed solar assembly absorbs less energy per unit area due to there being less absorber surface area pointed toward the sun because of the rounded design of an <b>evacuated</b> tube <b>collector.</b> Therefore, real world efficiencies of both designs are about the same.|$|R

The study is conducted for six cities of Abha, Dhahran, Hail, Jeddah, Nejran and Riyadh under three operating durations of 4, 6, and 8 hours using flat plate or <b>evacuated</b> tube <b>collectors.</b> The energy analysis concluded that flat plate collectors are better than <b>evacuated</b> tube <b>collectors.</b> However, the results from economic analysis suggest that while proposing a gas fired absorption chiller will reduce running costs, further reduction by using solar collectors is not feasible because of its high initial cost. At the best case scenario the Net Present Value of a 10 Ton Absorption chiller operated by natural gas boiler and two large flat plate collectors (12 m^ 2 each) running for 8 hours/day, 5 days/week has a value of 117, 000 $ and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 12 %. Solar driven absorption chiller could be more feasible if the gas prices increases or the solar collector prices decreases significantly. Finally, government economic incentives and taxes are recommended to provide a boost for the feasibility of such projects...|$|R
