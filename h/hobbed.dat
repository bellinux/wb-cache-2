40|$|External {{involute}} {{helical gears}} are usually manufactured through hobbing, commonly with a subsequent grinding or skiving operation. One way towards the industrial pursuit of more competitive and sustainable manufacturing {{is to reduce}} the number of processes, while retaining functionality and quality. In the hobbing of gears, the manufacturing errors are most often connected to the tool and/or the fixture. These errors need to be kept within tight tolerances to achieve sufficient quality of a finished <b>hobbed</b> gear. It would therefore be of great interest to be able to predetermine the quality of a finished <b>hobbed</b> gear, based on tolerances of the manufacturing process.

Various errors, linked to the manufacturing process, are introduced in the software implementation of the mathematical model.

40|$|Gear hobbing is well {{established}} {{and one of the}} most cost effective manufacturing methods of involute gears. In the hobbing of lead crown corrected helical gears, a well know drawback is the non-uniform systematic tooth alignment deviation that arises. This is sometimes denoted as flank twist. The inevitable tooth alignment deviation, together with other source deviations, must not exceed the specified tolerances if the gear is to be finished <b>hobbed.</b> To avoid trial and error when selecting manufacturing method, it would be of great industrial interest to be able to predetermine the least expected alignment deviation when the gear is to be finished <b>hobbed.</b> The main purpose of this study is to determine the magnitude of the systematic alignment deviations which arises for <b>hobbed</b> gears with lead crown correction. A simulation tool is developed where the hobbing process can be analysed, without additional errors resulting from real conditions. The results from this simulation tool show very good correlation with an experimental gear ground by a hob in industrial conditions. By elimination of feed marks on the gear tooth surface, a novel method to predetermine the least expected alignment deviation was found by an analytical analysis. The results from these studies can be used as a guideline when selecting manufacturing method for involute gears...|$|E

25|$|<b>Hobbing</b> uses a <b>hobbing</b> {{machine with}} two skew spindles, one mounted {{with a blank}} {{workpiece}} {{and the other with}} the <b>hob.</b> The angle between the <b>hob's</b> spindle (axis) and the workpiece's spindle varies, {{depending on the type of}} product being produced. For example, if a spur gear is being produced, then the <b>hob</b> is angled equal to the helix angle of the hob; if a helical gear is being produced then the angle must be increased by the same amount as the helix angle of the helical gear. The two shafts are rotated at a proportional ratio, which determines the number of teeth on the blank; for example, for a single-threaded <b>hob</b> if the gear ratio is 40:1 the <b>hob</b> rotates 40 times to each turn of the blank, which produces 40 teeth in the blank. If the <b>hob</b> has multiple threads the speed ratio must be multiplied by the number of threads on the <b>hob.</b> The <b>hob</b> is then fed up into the workpiece until the correct tooth depth is obtained. Finally the <b>hob</b> is fed through the workpiece parallel to the blank's axis of rotation.|$|R

Furthermore, the theoretical analysis was done by considering both the separation of teeth and the mesh with back faces which was not usually used. The main results were as follows. Applying transmitted tooth load variation, the degrees of the separation of teeth and the meshing with the back faces increased, and the fillet stress of the light-loaded gear increased. When the errors of the light-loaded gear decreased, the fillet stress can be decreased...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} {{property of}} manufacturing processes {{is the process}} reliability. This refers to the macrogeometry and to the achievable surface quality. In dry gear hobbing as the most productive and common manufacturing technology for the soft machining of cylindrical gears sometimes surface defects are noticed. These defects like welded-on chips and smeared areas on the flank are not acceptable. The mechanisms leading to surface defects are not known and understood in total. For the understanding, first the appearance and exact occurrence have to be investigated. Parallel, metallografic investigations are carried out for the characterization of the defects. Further on, the appearing of surface defects and characteristic values generated by a manufacturing simulation for gear hobbing are compared to find influences of the tool and process design on the tendency of dry <b>hobbed</b> gears towards surface defects...|$|E
40|$|The paper embraces three related subjects: Photo-elastic {{measurement}} of stresses in spur gear teeth; interpretation of stresses so found to give revised strength factors for B.

The object of t h i s paper is to propose maximum safe bending loads which involute spur gears can be allowed to carry. The gears investigated are confined to those which can be generated by standard cutters conforming to the 20 -deg. pressure-angle, B.

30|$|Further, the {{experiments}} in the <b>hobbing</b> process are too expensive {{as the cost of}} the <b>hob</b> tools or a gear <b>hobbing</b> machine is very high, and {{it is very difficult to}} measure the cutting force and temperature during the machining process. A fly <b>hobbing</b> experiment was designed to simulate the actual <b>hobbing</b> process by many authors as Rech (2006), Umezaki et al. (2012), and Stein et al. (2012). The present paper experimentally investigates applying new nanofluids to reduce the <b>hob</b> wear by reducing the cutting force, friction, and cutting temperature in the fly <b>hobbing</b> process. A fuzzy model based on the Taguchi experiment design has been used to optimize the multi-responses of the fly <b>hobbing</b> process. Using Minitab 16, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios for different outputs of the fuzzy model (the total cutting force, the force ratio Fz/Fy, the cutting temperature, and the surface roughness) were calculated by the Taguchi method. Then, the S/N ratios are used to determine a resultant index (the FRTS index) for estimating the fly <b>hobbing</b> process by using fuzzy logic theory. These FRTS values were used for multi-response optimization and gave the optimum parameter level for the fly <b>hobbing</b> process. Furthermore, the optimum parameters were applied for the actual <b>hobbing</b> process and compared with the initial parameters.|$|R
30|$|Applying nanofluid made {{by adding}} alumina {{nanoparticles}} to industrial oil {{may reduce the}} cutting force, friction, and cutting temperature and, from that, improve the tool life in the <b>hobbing</b> process.

Therefore, a fly <b>hobbing</b> test on the horizontal milling machine was performed to simulate the actual <b>hobbing</b> process.|$|R
30|$|The hobbing {{processes}} {{with complex}} kinematic motions cause the high friction coefficient, great cutting force, and high temperature. Those properties lead to hob wear, {{the main cause}} in reducing {{the quality of the}} <b>hobbed</b> gear, so using the suitable cutting fluid is very important. In recent years, nanolubricant, mixing the normal lubricant with nanoparticles, gradually became a new trend study for metal cutting enhancement. Especially, the Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles have many properties such as heat resistance, spherical shape, and a high specific temperature, consistent with adding to the industrial oils, so it is suitable for the machining process (Sharma et al, 2015). Malkin and Sridharan (2009) indicated that the new cutting fluids mixing the Al 2 O 3 powder with water were used to reduce the grinding forces and the cutting temperature and improve the surface roughness. Vasu and Reddy (2011) indicated that the using of the cutting fluids added Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles which can decrease the tool wear, temperature, and surface roughness in machining 600 aluminum alloys. And the influences of nanofluids on surface roughness and tool wear in the hobbing process concluded that using nanofluids with Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles resulted in decreasing surface roughness values (Ra, Rz) and tool wears in the manufactured spur gears, researched by Khalilpourazary and Meshkat (2014). But, the effect of Al 2 O 3 nanoparticle size and concentration that added to the cutting fluids in gear hobbing on the fundamental parameters of the hobbing process has not been published yet.|$|E
