5000|$|The term [...] "oligosaccharide" [...] {{encompasses}} carbohydrates {{that are}} larger than simple di- or tri-saccharides, but smaller than polysaccharides (greater than 10 units). Isomalto-oligosaccharides (IMO) are glucose oligomers with α-D-(1,6)-linkages, including isomaltose, panose, <b>isomaltotriose,</b> isomaltotetraose, isomaltopentaose, nigerose, kojibiose, and higher branched oligosaccharides. While human intestinal enzymes readily digest α(1,4)-glycosidic bonds, α(1,6)-linkages are not easily hydrolyzed and exhibit a digestion-resistant property. Therefore, IMO are only partially digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5000|$|For {{manufacturing}} IMO on {{a commercial}} scale, food industries use starch processed from cereal crops like wheat, barley, pulses (peas, beans, lentils), oats, tapioca, rice, potato and others. This variety in sources could benefit consumers who have allergies or hypersensitivity to certain cereal crops. The manufacturing process controls the degree of polymerization (dp) and the α(1,6)-linkages to ensure a consistent quality of IMO from different starch sources. The starch is first converted, by means of simple enzymatic hydrolysis, into high maltose syrup with di-, tri and oligosaccharides (2, 3 or more glucose units) having α(1,4)-glycosidic linkages which are readily digestible in the human intestine. These α(1,4)-glycosidic linkages are further converted into digestion-resistant α(1,6)-glycosidic linkages, creating [...] "iso" [...] linkages between glucose moieties and forming Isomalto-oligosaccharide (IMO). [...] The majority of oligosaccharides found in IMO consist of three to six monosaccharide (glucose) units linked together. However, disaccharides, as well as longer polysaccharides (up to nine glucose units), are also present. The disaccharide fraction of IMO consists mainly of α(1,6)-linked isomaltose, while maltotriose, panose, and <b>isomaltotriose</b> make up the trisaccharide fraction. A mixture of isomaltotetraose, isomaltopentaose, maltohexaose, maltoheptaose, and small amounts of oligomers with 8 or more degrees of polymerization, comprise the remaining oligomers in IMO. It {{should be noted that}} longer oligomers do not have 100% α(1,6)-linkages; the ratio of α(1,4)- to α(1,6)-linkages is variable.|$|E

The enzyme readily hydrolyzed dextran T- 2000 which consisted of more than 95 % of a-l, 6 -glucosidic linkage, giving rise to <b>isomaltotriose,</b> isomaltose and {{a small amount of}} glucose together with traces of higher oligomers, the degree of hydrolysis being about 40 %. Dextran IAM that contained 66 % of a-l, 6 -glucosidic linkage was hydrolyzed by the enzyme very slowly and to a lesser extent. Among a series of isomaltodextrins tested, G « to G 8 com-pounds were split into isomaltose and <b>isomaltotriose</b> at a rate comparable with that of hydrolysis of dextran T- 2000. The enzyme attacked <b>isomaltotriose</b> at an extremely slow rate and did not act on isomaltose. Comparison of the enzymatic digestion products from isomaltodextrins and their reduced derivatives (sugar alcohols) suggests that the enzyme removes primarily isomaltotriosyl unit and, to somewhat lesser extent, isomaltosyl unit from the nonreducing end of isomaltodextrins.

In untreated flours, sucrose was the main sugar; glucose, fructose, maltose and raffinose were also detected. During hydrolysis, there were increases in the maltose (2. 1 – 7. 6 g/ 100 g, depending on the sample), glucose and fructose contents and maltotriose and <b>isomaltotriose</b> were also increased. Roller-drying reduced the maltose content. Four commercial samples with rice or wheat were analysed: the sugar composition was 20 g/ 100 g sucrose and 3 g/ 100 g maltose.

Based on their similarity to characterized carbohydrate hydrolases, the Agl 1 and Agl 2 enzymes are both assigned to a subgroup of the glycosyl hydrolase family 13, the α- 1, 6 -glucosidases (EC 3. 2. 1. 10). Recombinant Agl 1 and Agl 2 into which a His 12 sequence was incorporated (Agl 1 His and Agl 2 His, respectively) exhibited hydrolytic activity towards panose, isomaltose, <b>isomaltotriose,</b> and four sucrose isomers—palatinose, trehalulose, turanose, and maltulose—while also degrading trehalose and, to a lesser extent, nigerose. The preferred substrates for both enzymes were panose, isomaltose, and trehalulose. Furthermore, the pH and temperature optima for both enzymes were determined, showing that Agl 1 His exhibits higher thermo and pH optima than Agl 2 His.

Results: To improve the process efficiency for production of IMOs, {{we developed a}} simple and efficient method by using enzyme cocktails composed of the recombinant Bacillus naganoensis pullulanase produced by Bacillus licheniformis, α-amylase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, barley bran β-amylase, and α-transglucosidase from Aspergillus niger to perform simultaneous saccharification and transglycosylation to process the liquefied starch. After 13  h of reacting time, 49. 09 % IMOs (calculated from {{the total amount of}} isomaltose, <b>isomaltotriose,</b> and panose) were produced.

40|$|A gene {{encoding}} {{a special}} thermophilic multifunctional amylase OPMA-N was cloned from Bacillus sp. ZW 2531 - 1. OPMA-N has an additional 124 -residue N-terminal domain compared with typical amylases and forms a rela-tively independent domain with a b-pleated sheet and random coil structure. Here we reported an unusual sub-strate and product specificities of OPMA-N {{and the impact}} of the additional N-terminal domain (1 – 124 aa) on the function and properties of OPMA-N. Both OPMA-N (12. 82 U/mg) and its N-terminal domain-truncated DOPMA-N (12. 55 U/mg) only degraded starch to produce oligosaccharides including maltose, maltotriose, <b>isomaltotriose,</b> and isomaltotetraose, but not to produce glucose. Therefore, the N-terminal domain did not determine its substrate and product specificities that were probably regulated by its C-terminal b-pleated sheet structure. However, the N-terminal domain of OPMA-N seemed to modulate its catalytic feature, leading to the production of more <b>isomaltotriose</b> and less maltose, and it seemed to contribute to OPMA-N’s thermostability since OPMA-N showed higher activity than DOPMA-N in a temperature range from 40 to 808 C and the half-life (t 1 2) was 5 h for OPMA-N and 2 h for DOPMA-N at 608 C. Both OPMA-N and DOPMA-N were Ca 21 -independent, but their activities could be influenced by Cu 21, Ni 21, Zn 21, EDTA, SDS (1 mM), or Triton-X 100 (1 %). Kinetic analysis and starch-adsorption assay indicated that the N-terminal domain of OPMA-N could increase the OPMA-N-starch binding and sub-sequently increase the catalytic efficiency of OPMA-N for starch. In particular, the N-terminal domain of OPMA-N did not determine its oligomerization, because both OPMA-N and DOPMA-N could exist in the forms of monomer, homodimer, and homooligomer at the same time...|$|E

The differences in behavior of the purified antibody fractions alone, or reconstituted in serum, in quantitative inhibition studies with the isomaltose series of oligosaccharides, or in quantitative precipitin studies with NRC dextrans of graded molecular weight, could be ascribed to differences in the sizes of their combining sites. It was shown that the antibody fractions eluted with isomaltose or <b>isomaltotriose</b> were made up largely of antibodies inhibited readily by the smaller oligosaccharides and therefore having {{a higher proportion of}} molecules with smaller-sized combining sites; whereas those fractions eluted with isomaltohexaose contained primarily antibodies readily inhibitable only with the larger oligosaccharides, and hence were considered to have a higher proportion of larger-sized combining sites. The purified antibody fractions were shown to be only fast gamma globulin,—to possess the same mobility in immunoelectrophoresis; in addition the antibody fractions from one individual in double diffusion in agar gave lines which fused with one another, with gamma globulin Fr. II, and with a purified antidextran solution containing the entire population of antidextran antibodies. Evidence was also presented which indicated little or no change in the populations of antibody molecules produced in these two individuals for a period as long as 10 years following immunization.

40|$|The actinobacterium Kribbella flavida NBRC 14399 (T) {{produces}} cyclobis-(1 -> 6) -alpha-nigerosyl (CNN), a cyclic glucotetraose with alternate alpha-(1 -> 6) - and alpha-(1 -> 3) -glucosidic linkages, from starch in {{the culture}} medium. We identified gene clusters associated with the production and intracellular catabolism of CNN in the K. flavida genome. One cluster encodes 6 -alpha-glucosyl-transferase and 3 -alpha-isomaltosyltransferase, which are known to coproduce CNN from starch. The other cluster contains four genes annotated as a transcriptional regulator, sugar transporter, glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 31 protein (Kfla 1895), and GH 15 protein (Kfla 1896). Kfla 1895 hydrolyzed the alpha-(1 -> 3) -glucosidic linkages of CNN and produced isomaltose via a possible linear tetrasaccharide. The initial rate of hydrolysis of CNN (11. 6 s(- 1)) was much {{higher than that of}} panose (0. 242 s(- 1)), and hydrolysis of <b>isomaltotriose</b> and nigerose was extremely low. Because Kfla 1895 has a strong preference for the alpha-(1 -> 3) -isomaltosyl moiety and effectively hydrolyzes the alpha-(1 -> 3) -glucosidic linkage, it should be termed 1, 3 -alpha-isomaltosidase. Kfla 1896 effectively hydrolyzed isomaltose with liberation of beta-glucose, but displayed low or no activity toward CNN and the general GH 15 enzyme substrates such as maltose, soluble starch, or dextran. The k(cat) /K-m for isomaltose (4. 81 +/- 0. 18 s(- 1) mM(- 1)) was 6. 9 - and 19 -fold higher than those for panose and <b>isomaltotriose,</b> respectively. These results indicate that Kfla 1896 is a new GH 15 enzyme with high substrate specificity for isomaltose, suggesting the enzyme should be designated an isomaltose glucohydrolase.

It could be demonstrated by quantitative microcomplement fixation inhibition assays that the antibody eluted with <b>isomaltotriose</b> had a higher affinity for smaller oligosaccharides relative to isomaltohexaose, indicating a high content of antibody molecules with smaller combining sites, while with the second fraction, eluted with isomaltohexaose, the small haptens were very poor inhibitors and the larger oligosaccharides inhibited readily, presumably due to {{a higher proportion of}} molecules with larger combining site size. Assays of similarly prepared fractions, obtained from earlier bleedings of the same individual (1), with inhibition of complement fixation were in good agreement with those obtained by inhibition of precipitation. The two purified antidextran fractions were shown to differ with respect to their complement-fixing capacity. The fraction with molecules with smaller size-combining sites fixed only about half as much complement per unit antibody N as did the fraction containing largely molecules with larger combining sites suggesting that the strength of complement fixation is affected by the strength of the antigen-antibody interaction...|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} of various isolated antibodies {{was determined by}} quantitative analyses for heavy chain subgroups and light chain types. Certain antibodies such as anti-tetanus toxoid and anti-A isoagglutinins were predominantly of the major γG 1 -type. However, a high preponderance of molecules of the minor γG 2 -subgroup was found for antibodies to dextran, levan, and teichoic acid. These findings explain some unusual features previously noted for anti-dextrans such as weak PCA reactions and lack of Gm antigens. Studies of several isolated antibodies from single heterozygous individuals showed a selective absence of genetic markers in certain antibodies and their presence in others. The "allelic exclusion" principle was clearly evident in the isolated antibodies of two different individuals. Large differences in the ratio of kappa to lambda light chains were observed for {{the same type of}} antibody from different individuals. Subfractionation of dextran antibodies by affinity for specific glycosidic linkage or combining site size produced marked changes in the ratios. The isomaltohexaose eluates of the dextran antibodies from two subjects were primarily kappa and the <b>isomaltotriose</b> eluates were predominantly lambda. The one anti-levan antibody studied was uniquely homogeneous, consisting exclusively of γG 2 -heavy chains and kappa light chains. By these criteria as well as others, it closely resembled myeloma proteins...|$|E
40|$|An {{extracellular}} α-glucosidase {{from the}} thermophilic archaebacterium Thermococcus strain AN 1 was purified 875 -fold in five steps (Hiload Q-Sepharose, phenyl Sepharose, HPHT-hydroxyapatite, gel filtration and Mono Q chromatography) with a yield of 4 %. It is a monomer with a molecular mass of about 60 kDa and a pI around 5. At 98 °C, the purified enzyme in buffer has a half-life around 35 min, which is increased to around 215 min in presence of l% (w/v) dithiothreitol and 1 % (w/v) BSA. Dithiothreitol (1 %, w/v) and BSA (0. 4 %, w/v) also substantially increase the enzyme activity. The Km at 75 °C is 0. 41 mM with pNP-α- -glucopyranoside as substrate. The substrate preference of the enzyme is: pNP-α-D-glucoside > nigerose > panose > palatinose > isomaltose > maltose and turanose. No activity was found against starch, pullulan, amylose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, <b>isomaltotriose,</b> cellobiose and β-gentiobiose. A variety of techniques including immobilization (e. g., on epoxy and glass beads), chemical modification (cross- and cocross-linking) {{and the use}} of additives (including polyhydroxylic molecules, BSA, salts, etc.) were applied to enhance stability at temperatures above 100 °C. The half-life could be increased from about 4 min at 110 °C to 30 – 60 min at 130 °C in presence of 90 % (w/v) sorbitol, 1 % (w/v) dithiothreitol and l% (w/v) BSA, and by cocross-linking with BSA in the presence of 90 % (w/v) sorbitol. The stabilized enzyme showed good activity at 130 °C...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{production}} of high-purity isomalto-oligosaccharides (IMO) involving the transglucosylation by transglucosidase and yeast fermentation was proposed. The starch of rice crumbs was enzymatically liquefied and saccharified, and then converted to low-purity IMO syrup by transglucosylation. The low-purity IMO produced either from rice crumbs or tapioca flour as the starch source could be effectively converted to high-purity IMO by yeast fermentation to remove the digestible sugars including glucose, maltose, and maltotriose. Both Saccharomyces carlsbergensis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were able to ferment glucose in the IMO syrup. Cells of S. carlsbergensis harvested from the medium of malt juice were also able to ferment maltose and maltotriose. A combination of these two yeasts or S. carlsbergensis alone could be used to totally remove the digestible sugars in the IMO, coupled with the production of ethanol. The resultant high-purity IMO, including mainly isomaltose, panose, and <b>isomaltotriose</b> made up more than 98 % w/w of the total sugars after a 3 -day fermentation. When the low-purity IMO was produced from the starch of tapioca flour, 3 -day fermentation under the same conditions resulted in IMO with purity lower than that from rice crumbs. For low-purity IMO from rice crumbs, fermentation with washed S. carlsbergensis cells harvested at log phase was the most effective. However, for the low-purity IMO from tapioca flour, incubation with S. cerevisiae for the first 24 h and then supplementing with an equal amount of S. carlsbergensis cells for further fermentation was the most effective approach for producing high-purity IMO.

40|$|International audienceIsomeric {{distinction}} of di- and tri-saccharides could be efficiently achieved by using data previously obtained while performing experiments aimed at discriminating monosaccharides using trimeric ion dissociation with data {{analysis by the}} kinetic method. This study shows that effects observed for lower homologues {{when one of the}} partners is changed in the metal/reference system (typically a transition metal divalent cation associated to amino acids) can be extrapolated to upper homologues, at least for the tested analyte series. Systems allowing galactose, glucose, and fructose distinction were used as starting conditions to resolve cellobiose, lactose, maltose, and saccharose disaccharides. When a unique dissociation reaction was observed from the trimeric clusters, a new reference was selected based on its propensity to favor the analyte or the reference release, as revealed from monosaccharide experiments, depending on the desired effect. The same approach could be implemented from data obtained for disaccharides to select efficient metal/reference systems to distinguish cellotriose, <b>isomaltotriose,</b> maltotriose, and panose trisaccharides. As a result, method optimization is greatly improved due to an enhanced rationalization of the search for discriminant systems. While 40 systems had to be tested for monosaccharides, by screening five transition metals and eight amino acids, the proposed approach allowed efficient metal/reference systems to be found for disaccharides after testing 18 combinations; then, only four systems had to be scrutinized to achieve trisaccharide distinction. Accurate quantitative analyses could be performed in binary mixtures using three-point calibration curves to correct for competition effects between analytes for the formation of the trimeric clusters...|$|E
40|$|This paper deals solely with idiotypic determinants, the {{configurations}} {{of which are}} modified when the antibody bearing them interacts with its ligand. This phenomenon is measured as an inhibition of the reaction between anti-idiotype and idiotype. Two points are made: (a) The assay for ligand-modifiable determinants {{can be used to}} determine the "size" of the combining site. This is illustrated here with the anti-α(1 → 6) dextran mouse myeloma immunoglobulin W 3129. Whether the interaction between a homologous series of α(1 → 6) oligosaccharide ligands and the combining site of W 3129 is measured by inhibition of precipitation with α(1 → 6) dextran (4) or of binding of W 3129 to anti-W 3129 idiotype, the finding is the same. The order of inhibition is isomaltohexaose = isomaltopentaose >> isomaltotetraose > <b>isomaltotriose</b> >>> isomaltose. The combining site is optimally complementary to isomaltopentaose. (b) Cross-idiotypic specificity is closely correlated with cross-combining specificity; the converse is not true. This is illustrated here with three groups of mouse myeloma immunoglobulin, each specific for α(1 → 3) dextran, α(1 → 6) dextran, β(2 → 1) or β(2 → 6) levan. If a given anti-idiotypic serum cross-reacted with several myeloma proteins, they always had similar combining specificity. Thus the three proteins, J 558, MOPC 104 E, and UPC 102, which cross-react with anti-J 558 have combining specificity for α(1 → 3) dextran; cross-reacting W 3082, UPC 61, and Y 5476 have specificity for levan; and cross-reacting W 3129 and W 3434 have specificity for α(1 → 6) dextran. This extends previous studies with proteins specific for phosphorylcholine (7) or γ-globulin (8). As expected, the converse is not true, for proteins may have combining specificity for α(1 → 6) dextran e. g. QUPC 52, or levan e. g. J 606, UPC 10 and yet not carry the above-mentioned reference idiotypes. The correlation between cross-idiotypic and combining specificity breaks down when idiotypic determinants which are not modifiable by ligand are studied. The implications of this are pointed out since most investigations deal with ligand-nonmodifiable determinants...|$|E
40|$|Binding {{constants}} of the dextran-reactive BALB/c mouse IgA myeloma proteins W 3129 and QUPC 52 {{have been}} determined for {{each member of}} the isomaltose series of oligosaccharides and for methyl alphaDglucoside. Protein W 3129 has maximum complementarity for isomaltopentaose (IM 5) deltaf degrees = 7, 180 cal/mol) with 55 - 60 % of the total binding energy directed against methylalphaDglucoside. Protein QUPC 52 gives maximum binding with isomaltohexaose (IM 6) (deltaF degrees = - 5, 340 cal/mol) and has about 70 % of its total binding energy for <b>isomaltotriose</b> (IM 3), but at most only 5 % for isomaltose (IM 2) or methyl alphaDglucoside. Protein W 3129 precipitates with branched dextrans high in alpha (1 yields 6) linkages and reacts with but does not precipitate a synthetic alpha (1 yields 6) -linked linear dextran. Protein QUPC 52 precipitates both branched and linear dextrans. Thus, the immunodominant group for protein W 3129 is mimicked by methyl alphaDglucoside and this protein reacts exclusively at the terminal nonreducing ends of alpha (1 yields 6) -linked dextran chains. Protein QUPC 52 has an immunodominant group which is expressed by IM 3 but not smaller oligosaccharides and this protein can react at nonterminal locations along alpha (1 yields 6) - linked dextran chains. Precipitation of linear dextran seems to be a valid although not quantitative assay for antidextrans with nonterminal specificity. Quantitative precipitin reactions with branched and linear dextrans suggest that alpha (1 yields 6) -specific human antidextrans are mixtures of molecules having terminal and nonterminal specificities and that the fraction of each type can vary among individuals. Rabbit antisera against IM 3 or IM 6 coupled to bovine serum albumin also appear to contain antibodies with nonterminal specificity for dextran chains although a large fraction has terminal specificity. Low molecular weight clinical dextran N- 150 N (congruent to 60, 000) reacted more like linear dextran than like its parent native-branched dextran B 512. This is thought to result from an abundance of nonterminal determinants in clinical dextran N- 150 N but {{a very small number of}} functional terminal determinants per molecule. An appreciation of terminal and nonterminal specificities and of the different immunodominant structures in isomaltosyl chains has proven to be of a great value in understanding the immunochemical reactions of dextrans. Moreover, certain previous findings with fructosan-reactive mouse myeloma proteins and human antilevans (55, 84) also suggest terminal and nonterminal specificities for levan chains...|$|E
