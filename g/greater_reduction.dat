Phonon transport simulations indicate that substitutional defects such as nitrogen or boron will primarily lead to scattering of high-frequency optical phonons.

25|$|Baird's {{comments}} at {{the time}} of introduction generally spoke of a two-color, 1,000-line resolution signal. This would have required considerable radio bandwidth and would be incompatible with the pre-war 405-line system introduced by EMI and the BBC. However, in the patent application he also considered the possibility of compatible color systems. One would use either frame of the existing interlaced image for each color, although this would reduce the effective resolution from 405 to 202 lines, and the frame rate from 50 to 25fps which would increase flicker in areas of mixed color. He also mentions a system broadcasting full 405-line images, but at even <b>greater</b> <b>reduction</b> in frame rate to 12.5fps, which is noted would cause considerable flicker.|$|E
25|$|The 5α-reductase inhibitors {{finasteride}} and dutasteride {{may also}} be used in men with BPH. These medications inhibit the 5α-reductase enzyme, which, in turn, inhibits production of DHT, a hormone responsible for enlarging the prostate. Effects may take longer to appear than alpha blockers, but they persist for many years. When used together with alpha blockers, no benefit was reported in short-term trials, but in a longer term study (3–4 years) there was a <b>greater</b> <b>reduction</b> in BPH progression to acute urinary retention and surgery than with either agent alone, especially in patients were more severe symptoms and larger prostates. Other trials have confirmed reductions in symptoms, within 6 months in one trial, an effect that was maintained after withdrawal of the alpha blocker. Side effects include decreased libido and ejaculatory or erectile dysfunction. The 5α-reductase inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnant women because of their teratogenicity due to interference with fetal testosterone metabolism, and as a precaution, pregnant women should not handle crushed or broken tablets.|$|E

2500|$|Most LCAs of PV {{have focused}} on two categories: carbon dioxide {{equivalents}} per kWh and energy pay-back time (EPBT). The [...] EPBT is defined as [...] " [...] {{the time needed to}} compensate for the total renewable- and non-renewable- primary energy required during the life cycle of a PV system". A 2015 review of EPBT from first and second generation PV suggested that there was greater variation in embedded energy than in efficiency of the cells implying that it was mainly the embedded energy that needs to reduce to have a <b>greater</b> <b>reduction</b> in EPBT. One difficulty in determining impacts due to PV is to determine if the wastes are released to the air, water, or soil during the manufacturing phase. Research is underway to try to understand emissions and releases during the lifetime of PV systems.|$|E

2500|$|One {{reason why}} the Federal Reserve did not act to limit {{the decline of the}} money supply was the gold standard. At that time, the amount of credit the Federal Reserve could issue was limited by the Federal Reserve Act, which {{required}} 40% gold backing of Federal Reserve Notes issued. By the late 1920s, the Federal Reserve had almost hit the limit of allowable credit that could be backed by the gold in its possession. This credit was in the form of Federal Reserve demand notes. A [...] "promise of gold" [...] is not as good as [...] "gold in the hand", particularly when they only had enough gold to cover 40% of the Federal Reserve Notes outstanding. During the bank panics a portion of those demand notes were redeemed for Federal Reserve gold. Since the Federal Reserve had hit its limit on allowable credit, any reduction in gold in its vaults had to be accompanied by a <b>greater</b> <b>reduction</b> in credit. On April 5, 1933, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102 making the private ownership of gold certificates, coins and bullion illegal, reducing the pressure on Federal Reserve gold.|$|E
2500|$|ROS are {{produced}} intracellularly through multiple mechanisms {{and depending on}} the cell and tissue types, the major sources being the [...] "professional" [...] producers of ROS: NADPH oxidase (NOX) complexes (7 distinct isoforms) in cell membranes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and endoplasmic reticulum. Mitochondria convert energy for the cell into a usable form, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The process in which ATP is produced, called oxidative phosphorylation, involves the transport of protons (hydrogen ions) across the inner mitochondrial membrane {{by means of the}} electron transport chain. In the electron transport chain, electrons are passed through a series of proteins via oxidation-reduction reactions, with each acceptor protein along the chain having a <b>greater</b> <b>reduction</b> potential than the previous. The last destination for an electron along this chain is an oxygen molecule. In normal conditions, the oxygen is reduced to produce water; however, in about 0.1–2% of electrons passing through the chain (this number derives from studies in isolated mitochondria, though the exact rate in live organisms is yet to be fully agreed upon), oxygen is instead prematurely and incompletely reduced to give the superoxide radical (•), most well documented for Complex I and Complex III. Superoxide is not particularly reactive by itself, but can inactivate specific enzymes or initiate lipid peroxidation in its protonated form, hydroperoxyl HO. The pKa of hydroperoxyl is 4.8. Thus, at physiological pH, the majority will exist as superoxide anion.|$|E

But as the funding of the debt in a 4 or a 4 1/2 per cent loan would reduce annual current expenses largely, thus, after funding, justifying a <b>greater</b> <b>reduction</b> of taxation than would be now expedient, I suggest postponement of this question until the next meeting of Congress.|$|E
30|$|The {{scenario}} {{that accounts for}} a combination of RG and PP based on SedFil modifications resulted in the <b>greatest</b> <b>reductions</b> in shear stress. RG came in the second order with respect to <b>greatest</b> <b>reductions</b> in shear stresses. The DP contributed to lowering shear stresses and peak flow especially {{at the beginning of}} the storm. In general, the SedFil accounts for a ponding area where runoff will be captured and seeps out or overflows within 24  h. This functionality of the SedFil contributed to reducing peak flows, volumes and slightly delaying the peak flows.|$|R

[...] It should be borne in mind that game-cocks before they fought were always weighed, so that nothing was left to the imagination about any reduction or increase of weight. Mr. Clark does not seem to have bred from brothers and sisters, which is the most injurious kind of union; and he found, after repeated trials, that there was a <b>greater</b> <b>reduction</b> in weight in the young from a father paired with his daughter, than from a mother with her son. I may add that Mr. Eyton of Eyton, the well-known ornithologist, who is a large breeder of Grey Dorkings, informs me that they certainly diminish in size, and become less prolific, unless a cross with another strain is occasionally obtained. So it is with Malays, according to Mr. Hewitt, as far as size is concerned. (17/34. 'The Poultry Book' by W.B. Tegetmeier 1866 page 79.) ...|$|E
