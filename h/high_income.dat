5000|$|Studies {{have shown}} that men who [...] "earn <b>high</b> <b>incomes</b> have a {{decreased}} probability of getting a divorce". However, <b>higher</b> <b>income</b> makes a woman's chances of marriage less likely and it has no connection to possible divorces. In recent years, divorce rates have gone down due to education rates going up.

Lower income couples value and respect marriage {{just as much as}} <b>higher</b> <b>income</b> couples, however lower income couples are more likely to get a divorce because of financial stains on their marriage.

25|$|Research {{has shown}} that the direct rebound effects for energy {{services}} is lower at <b>high</b> <b>income</b> levels, due to less price sensitivity. Studies have found that own-price elasticity of gas consumption by UK households was two times greater for households in the lowest income decile when compared to the highest decile. Studies have also observed higher rebounds in low-income houses for improvements in heating technology. Evaluation methods have also been used to assess the scale of rebound effects from efficient heating installations in lower income homes in the United Kingdom. This research found that direct effects are close to 100% in many cases. <b>High</b> <b>income</b> households in developed countries are likely to set the temperature at the optimum comfort level, regardless of the cost – therefore any cost reduction does not result in increased heating, for it was already optimal. But low-income households are more price sensitive, and have made thermal sacrifices due to the cost of heating. In this case, a high direct rebound is likely. This analogy can be extended to most household energy consumption.|$|E

50|$|Proportional {{taxes on}} {{consumption}} are {{considered by some}} to be regressive; that is, low-income people tend to spend a greater percentage of their income in taxable sales (using a cross section timeframe) than <b>higher</b> <b>income</b> people. A regressive tax is when the average tax rate is lower, with <b>higher</b> <b>income.</b> So income and average tax rate have an inverse relationship. However, this calculation is derived when the tax paid is divided not by the tax base (the amount spent) but by income, which is argued to create an arbitrary relationship.
