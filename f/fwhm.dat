The instruments could localize bright sources in the 6 to 180keV range to within 0.5° using a Rotation Modulation Collimator. Taken together, the instruments' three fields of view covered approximately 75% of the sky. The energy resolution was 30% <b>FWHM</b> at 60keV. During quiet periods, count rates in two energy bands (6 to 15 and 15 to 180keV) were accumulated for 4, 8, or 16 seconds, depending on onboard computer memory availability. During a burst or transient event, count rates were accumulated with a time resolution of 1 second per 36 energy channels.|$|E

25|$|Reducing defects on extreme {{ultraviolet}} (EUV) masks is currently {{one of the}} most critical issues to be addressed for commercialization of EUV lithography. Defects can be buried underneath or within the multilayer stack or be on top of the multilayer stack. Mesas or protrusions form on the sputtering targets used for multilayer deposition, which may fall off as particles during the multilayer deposition. In fact, defects of atomic scale height (0.3–0.5nm) with 100nm <b>FWHM</b> can still be printable by exhibiting 10% CD impact. IBM and Toppan reported at Photomask Japan 2015 that smaller defects, e.g., 50nm size, can have 10% CD impact even with 0.6nm height, yet remain undetectable.|$|E

Resolution figures are given with reference to specified gamma ray energies. Resolution can be expressed in absolute (i.e., eV or MeV) or relative terms. [...] For example, a sodium iodide (NaI) detector may have a <b>FWHM</b> of 9.15keV at 122keV, and 82.75keV at 662keV. These resolution values are expressed in absolute terms. To express the resolution in relative terms, the <b>FWHM</b> in eV or MeV is divided by the energy of the gamma ray and usually shown as percentage. Using the preceding example, the resolution of the detector is 7.5% at 122keV, and 12.5% at 662keV.

40|$|We aim to {{characterize}} the nature of galaxies whose optical emission line diagnostics are consistent with star formation, but whose X-ray properties strongly point towards {{the presence of an}} AGN. Understanding these sources is of particular importance in assessing the completeness of AGN samples derived from large galaxy surveys, selected {{solely on the basis of}} their optical spectral properties. We construct a large sample of 211 NELGs, which have <b>FWHMs</b> Hb emission line 1), and large X/O ratio (> 0. 1), while the rest are consistent with being simply SF galaxies. Those 28 galaxies exhibit the broadest Hb line <b>FWHMs,</b> from ~ 300 to 1200 km/s, and their X-ray spectrum is steeper than average and often displays a soft excess. We therefore conclude that the population of X-ray luminous NELGs with optical lines consistent with those of a starforming galaxy (which represent 19 % of our whole sample) is largely dominated by NLS 1 s. The occurrence of such sources in the overall optically selected sample is small (< 2 %), hence the contamination of optically selected galaxies by NLS 1 s is very small.

40|$|Springs are {{groundwater}} discharge points {{that serve as}} vital coldwater sources for streams in southeast Minnesota. The springs generally emanate from Paleozoic carbonate and siliciclastic bedrock aquifers. Use of systematic dye tracing began in the 1970 s and continues through the present as a standard method for investigating karst hydrology and to map springsheds,. The work was accelerated in 2007 because of increased funding from the State of Minnesota’s Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund. A compilation springshed map of dye traces conducted {{over the last several}} decades has been assembled for the region. In southeast Minnesota, the springs are the outlets of conduit flow systems in both carbonate and siliciclastic bedrock aquifers. Conduit flow dominates groundwater transport in carbonate aquifers and is an important component of groundwater flow in siliciclastic aquifers. Conduit flow in aquifers occurs independently of {{the presence or absence of}} surface karst features. The springsheds of these springs have three interacting components: Groundwater Springsheds (analogous to classic karst autogenic recharge areas), Surface Water Springsheds (analogous to classic karst allogenic surface runoff areas), and Regional Groundwater Springsheds. Surface Water Springsheds can be up to several orders-of-magnitude larger than the Groundwater Springsheds to which they contribute water. Surface Water Springsheds can feed surface flow into one or several stream sinks. Those multiple stream sinks may be in one or more Groundwater Springsheds. The leading edges of dye tracing breakthrough curves typically show groundwater flow velocities in the hundreds-of-meters to kilometers-per-day range in all of the bedrock aquifers tested. The width and duration of tails of breakthrough curves in these conduit flow systems vary with the bedrock aquifers. The Galena Group has Full Widths at Half Maximums (<b>FWHMs)</b> of a few hours and tails that are down to background in a few days. The Prairie du Chien Group also has <b>FWHMs</b> of hours but has tails that continue for weeks. The St. Lawrence and Lone Rock Formations have <b>FWHMs</b> of months to years...|$|R

The WMAP team finds that the PVF is greater than half of its maximal value (the [...] "full width at half maximum", or <b>FWHM)</b> over an {{interval}} of 115,000 years.

2500|$|This {{analyzer}} crystal {{acts as an}} angular filter for {{the radiation}} coming from the sample. When these X-rays hit the analyzer crystal the condition of Bragg diffraction is satisfied only for a very narrow range of incident angles. When the scattered or refracted X-rays have incident angles outside this range {{they will not be}} reflected at all and don´t contribute to the signal. Refracted X-rays within this range will be reflected depending on the incident angle.

40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} is {{a powerful}} tool in identifying different calcium carbonate polymorphs. Here, the method is applied to cultured pearls from freshwater (genus Hyriopsis) and marine bivalve species (Pinctada maxima) {{as well as to}} shells of Diplodon chilensis patagonicus bivalves. Raman spectra for vaterite, detected {{for the first time in}} an adult shell, and amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) are discussed. Results for ACC are compared with those of synthetically produced ACC and with the Raman spectroscopic features of stable biogenic ACC from the crustacean Porcellio scaber. Decomposition of the most intense signal of all calcium carbonate polymorphs-the v₁ symmetric stretching mode of the carbonate ion-leads to the identification of two polymorphs within the ACC areas: a mixure of an amorphous and a crystalline fraction. The amorphous phase is characterised by a broad peak in the region of the lattice modes, which is composed of two distinct lattice modes with very high full-widths at half-maximum (<b>FWHMs).</b> The <b>FWHMs</b> of most of the crystalline fractions (in the range of 6. 3 - 10. 7 cm⁻¹) are too high for well-crystallised materials and support reports of nanocrystalline calcium carbonate polymorph clusters in ACC.

The two strongest UV peaks were found at 377. 9 nm from ZnO films grown at 650 and 700 degrees C. This result is consistent with that of the XRD investigation.
