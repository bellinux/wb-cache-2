40|$|Aluminum {{complexes}} of non-chiral-salalen ligands {{were investigated}} in the catalysis of ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of lactide and ε-caprolactone {{and in their}} copolymerization. The aluminum-salalen complexes were found to polymerize all varieties of lactide, namely: L-, D-, rac- and meso-lactide, and showed moderate productivities. rac-LA gave rise to isotactic polylactides (with Pm up to 72 %), while meso-LA gave rise to heterotactic polylactides (with a Pm of 79 %). An experiment was <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>distinguishing</b> between chain-end control and enantiomorphic-site control combined with polymeryl exchange for the isotactic stereoblock microstructure observed for the PLA produced from rac-LA; it gave strong evidence for polymeryl exchange between propagating species.

As the class probabilities change in response to received data, the waveforms are adapted, which leads to faster decisions. I...|$|R

40|$|A new {{aromatic}} pair, 2 -hydroxy- 6 -methoxybenzamide/ 1 -methylpyrrole at {{the terminal}} position of hairpin polyamides has been <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>distinguishing</b> T·A from A·T base pairs and both from G·C/C·G {{in the minor}} groove of DNA. Four eight-ring hairpin polyamides with benzamide (Bz), 2 -hydroxybenzamide (Hb- 1), 2 -hydroxy- 6 -methylbenzamide (Hb- 2), and 2 -hydroxy- 6 -methoxybenzamide (Hb- 3) at the N-terminal position were synthesized. The equilibrium association constants (K_a) were determined at four DNA sites which differ at a single common position, 5 ‘-TNTACA- 3 ‘ (N = T, A, G, C). Quantitative DNase I footprint titration experiments reveal that (Hb- 3) PyPyPy-(R) ^H 2 ^Nγ-ImPyPyPy-β-Dp (4) bound the sequences 5 ‘-TTTACA- 3 ‘ and 5 ‘-TATACA- 3 ‘ with high affinity; K_a = 2. 6 × 10 ^(10) M^(- 1) and K_a = 8. 4 × 10 ^ 9 M^(- 1), respectively, a 3 -fold specificity for T vs A was found. Importantly, the sequences 5 ‘-TGTACA- 3 ‘ and 5 ‘-TCTACA- 3 ‘ are bound with 50 and 200 times lower affinity, revealing an overall specificity of Hb- 3 /Py of T > A ≫ G > C.

40|$|Theorists {{have only}} {{recently}} shown that cooperation through indirect reciprocity can evolve. The first modelling approach favoured a mechanism called image scoring. Helping someone increases ones image score, whereas refusing to help reduces it. The evolutionary outcome vv as a discriminator image scoring strategy that helps everybody who has, for example, a positive image score. Two experimental studies with humans found results that were compatible with discriminator image scoring. However, a new analysis of other theorists, leased on another population structure, has cast doubts on the evolutionary stability of strategies using the recipient's score as a sole basis for decision. The new theoretical study confirmed that a strategy aiming at 'good standing' has superior properties and easily beats image scoring. :fin individual loses good standing by failing to help a recipient in good standing, whereas failing to help recipients who lack good standing does not damage the standing of a potential donor (but would reduce his image score). The present empirical study with 23 groups of seven human subjects each was <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>distinguishing</b> between the two proposed mechanisms experimentally. The results differed strongly from standing strategies, which might demand too much working memory capacity; but were compatible with image scoring or a similar strategy to a large extent. Furthermore, donors of constant 'NO players' compensated for their refusing to help these players by being snore generous to other...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background: Current ultrasonographic scoring systems used {{to assess}} the degree of finger joint {{synovitis}} in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are not <b>designed</b> <b>for</b> <b>distinguishing</b> healthy or osteoarthritis (OA) patients from those with RA in clinical settings. Objective: To explore a novel scoring approach using structural and synovial ultrasonographic features to distinguish between healthy and OA finger joints and those with RA. Methods: 22 patients with RA, 16 healthy controls, and 14 OA controls received a comprehensive ultrasound of one hand, with scores assigned using a modification of a previously reported RA scoring system (Semiquantitative Synovial Score), and using the novel approach (Combined Structural/Synovial Score). The number of joints classified as supporting the diagnosis of RA (“RA-supported”) with each approach was recorded. Sensitivity and specificity for each scoring system were calculated with respect to the clinical diagnosis. Results: The Semiquantitative Synovial Score was highly sensitive (100 %), but without specificity (0 %) for the diagnosis of RA, when RA was defined as having more than 1 joint classified as “RA-supported. ” The Combined Structural/Synovial Score had high sensitivity (95 %) and moderate specificity (77 %) when RA was defined as having any joint classified as “RA-supported”. Moderate sensitivity (73 %) and high specificity (97 %) were found when having more than 1 joint classified as “RA-supported ” was required to diagnose RA. Conclusion: A novel structural and synovial hand joint scoring system was capable of distinguishing OA and healthy controls from RA subjects in this pilot evaluation. Prospective validation of this approach is planned...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{observe that}} some natural {{mathematical}} definitions are lifting properties relative to simplest counterexamples, namely {{the definitions of}} surjectivity and injectivity of maps, {{as well as of}} being connected, separation axioms T 0 and T 1 in topology, having dense image, induced (pullback) topology, and every real-valued function being bounded (on a connected domain). We also offer a couple of brief speculations on cognitive and AI aspects of this observation, particularly that in point-set topology some arguments read as diagram chasing computations with finite preorders. 2.

40|$|Recently, {{genomics}} analyses {{have demonstrated}} that alternative splicing is widespread in mammalian genomes (30 – 60 % of genes reported to have multiple isoforms), and {{may be one of}} their most important mechanisms of functional regulation. However, by comparison with other genomics data such as genome annotation, SNPs, or gene expression, there exists relatively little database infrastructure for the study of alternative splicing. We have constructed an online database ASAP (the Alternative Splicing Annotation Project) for biologists to access and mine the enormous wealth of alternative splicing information coming from genomics and proteomics. ASAP is based on genome-wide analyses of alternative splicing in human (30 793 alternative splice relationships found) from detailed alignment of expressed sequences onto the genomic sequence. ASAP provides precise gene exon–intron structure, alternative splicing, tissue specificity of alternative splice forms, and protein isoform sequences resulting from alternative splicing. Moreover, it can help biologists <b>design</b> probe sequences <b>for</b> <b>distinguishing</b> specific mRNA isoforms.
