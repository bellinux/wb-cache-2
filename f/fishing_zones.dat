5|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is taken}} by {{fisheries}} operating off Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and likely elsewhere, using longlines, gillnets, and trawls. The meat and liver are eaten, though sharks from certain areas present a substantial risk of ciguatera poisoning (especially the liver, which contains {{a much higher}} concentration of the toxin than the meat). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, as its numbers have dropped in recent decades due to increasing, and thus far unregulated, fishing pressure in the tropics. Its restricted habitat, low dispersal, and slow reproduction are factors that limit this shark's capacity for recovering from overfishing. On the Great Barrier Reef, populations of whitetip reef sharks in <b>fishing</b> <b>zones</b> have been reduced by 80% relative to no-entry zones. Furthermore, populations in no-take zones, where boats are allowed but fishing prohibited, exhibit levels of depletion comparable to <b>fishing</b> <b>zones</b> due to poaching. Demographic models indicate that these depleted populations will continue to decline by 6.68.3% per year without additional conservation measures.|$|E
5|$|Although still {{abundant}} at Cocos Island {{and other}} relatively pristine sites, grey reef sharks {{are susceptible to}} localized depletion due to their slow reproductive rate, specific habitat requirements, and tendency to stay within a certain area. The IUCN has assessed the grey reef shark as Near Threatened; this shark is taken by multispecies fisheries {{in many parts of}} its range and used for various products such as shark fin soup and fishmeal. Another threat is the continuing degradation of coral reefs from human development. There is evidence of substantial declines in some populations. Anderson et al. (1998) reported, in the Chagos Archipelago, grey reef shark numbers in 1996 had fallen to 14% of 1970s levels. Robbins et al. (2006) found grey reef shark populations in Great Barrier Reef <b>fishing</b> <b>zones</b> had declined by 97% compared to no-entry zones (boats are not allowed). In addition, no-take zones (boats are allowed but fishing is prohibited) had the same levels of depletion as <b>fishing</b> <b>zones,</b> illustrating the severe effect of poaching. Projections suggested the shark population would fall to 0.1% of pre-exploitation levels within 20 years without additional conservation measures. One possible avenue for conservation is ecotourism, as grey reef sharks are suitable for shark-watching ventures, and profitable diving sites now enjoy protection in many countries, such as the Maldives.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the north}} coast of Java island there are many small groups of coastal fishermen, who don't have a luxury to have {{information}} such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and potential <b>fishing</b> <b>zone.</b> Their operational cost inreased because have to look around and spent some extra fuel {{to search for the}} presence of fish. SST as a parameter for potential <b>fishing</b> <b>zone</b> can be obtained from the calculation of the thermal band LANDSAT 8. SST was then used as the primary input in thermal front detection using Single Image Edge Detection (SIED) method (1992, Cayula and Cornillon). SIED method has been implemented using low-resolution satellite imagery for Indonesian waters including Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) with sensor Visible/Infrared Imager and Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The {{purpose of this study is}} to know the movement of thermal fronts in coastal areas. So that the coastal fishermen who gone fishing for only one day can get the potential <b>fishing</b> <b>zone</b> information periodically and reduce their operational cost for daily fishing efficiently. Besides that for increasing the spatial resolution from Potential <b>Fishing</b> <b>Zone</b> (PFZ) information becomes more detailed and specific for particular region which having coastal fishermen...|$|R
