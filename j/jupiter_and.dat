5|$|In 1614, German {{astronomer}} Johannes Kepler {{determined that}} {{a series of three}} conjunctions of the planets <b>Jupiter</b> <b>and</b> Saturn occurred in the year 7 BC. He argued (incorrectly) that a planetary conjunction could create a nova, which he linked to the Star of Bethlehem. Modern calculations show that there was a gap of nearly a degree (approximately twice a diameter of the moon) between the planets, so these conjunctions were not visually impressive. An ancient almanac has been found in Babylon which covers the events of this period, but does not indicate that the conjunctions were of any special interest. In the 20th century, Prof. Karlis Kaufmanis, an astronomer, argued that this was an astronomical event where <b>Jupiter</b> <b>and</b> Saturn were in a triple conjunction in the constellation Pisces. Archaeologist and Assyriologist Simo Parpola has also suggested this explanation.|$|E
5|$|In {{a revised}} version of the Nice model Jupiter trojans are {{captured}} when Jupiter encounters an ice giant during the instability. In {{this version of the}} Nice model one of the ice giants (Uranus, Neptune, or a lost fifth planet) is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and is scattered outward by Jupiter causing the orbits of <b>Jupiter</b> <b>and</b> Saturn to quickly separate. When Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps during these encounters existing Jupiter trojans can escape and new objects with semi-major axes similar to Jupiter's new semi-major axis are captured. Following its last encounter the ice giant can pass through one of the libration points and perturb their orbits leaving this libration point depleted relative to the other. After the encounters end some of these Jupiter trojans are lost and others captured when <b>Jupiter</b> <b>and</b> Saturn are near weak mean motion resonances such as the 3:7 resonance via the mechanism of the original Nice model.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-14b is an {{extrasolar planet}} {{in orbit around}} the primary star of the binary Kepler-14 system. It is {{currently}} the only planet known to exist in this star system.

It was discovered by NASA-led Kepler mission, which noted the planet as a planetary candidate as early as March 2009, {{around the same time}} as the discovery of the first five planets discovered by Kepler (Kepler-4b to Kepler-8b). However, the team was unable to confirm the planet until extensive follow-up observations, as high-resolution imaging resolved the star Kepler-14 as a closely orbiting binary system. The Kepler team would have not noticed that Kepler-14 was a binary star based solely on initial radial velocity measurements (a standard method for confirming a planet's existence), and found that if they had not realized this, their data on Kepler-14b would have been very inaccurate.|$|E

The Kepler team made data collected by its satellite publicly available, including data on Kepler-40; French and Swiss astronomers used the equivalent to one night of measurements on the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph to collect all the data needed to show that a planet was producing the periodic dimming of Kepler-40. The planet, Kepler-40b, is twice the mass of <b>Jupiter</b> <b>and</b> slightly larger than it in size, making it as dense as Neptune.
