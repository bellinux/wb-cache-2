40|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>analysts</b> are {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} users of corporate information. Moreover, they have a significant influence on the capital market by means of their recommendations to investors. However, previous researches documented differences in the accuracy of analysts' forecasts, attributable to numerous determinants. One of them is the amount and the nature of information used by <b>financial</b> <b>analysts.</b> However, prior research on this topic is rare. Therefore, we elaborate the existing literature by examining the relationship between information use and forecast accuracy for a sample of Belgian <b>financial</b> <b>analysts.</b> More specifically, we concentrate on the use of non-financial information because this information is becoming more important relative to financial information in the evaluation of firms' performance. Our results demonstrate that the quantity of the non-financial information used by <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> is insignificantly related to forecast accuracy. So as <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> are using more corporate non-financial information, their forecast accuracy is not affected. We also examined whether the use of annual report information, respectively the use of non-annual report information influence forecast accuracy.

The bond markets in the Netherlands and Britain had been established longer but tended to be small, and revolved around sovereign governments that were trusted to honor their debts. Companies were founded to provide investors with financial information on the growing railroad industry, including Henry Varnum Poor's publishing company, which produced a publication compiling financial data about the railroad and canal industries. Following the 1907 financial crisis, demand rose for such independent market information, in particular for independent analyses of bond creditworthiness. In 1909, <b>financial</b> <b>analyst</b> John Moody issued a publication focused solely on railroad bonds.

At the beginning of the novel, Hans is preparing to return to Manhattan for the funeral of estranged friend Chuck Ramkissoon, who becomes the central figure of the novel. Chuck, a Trinidadian immigrant, guides Hans into and through the world of The Staten Island Cricket Club, most of whose members are also of West Indian or South Asian descent. Chuck is a charismatic idealist, running multiple (occasionally illegitimate) businesses, and making big, optimistic plans for the future. While Hans is swept along by Chuck’s magnetic ardor for the American dream, Rachel moves back to London under the pretense of safety for their young son and ideological indignation over the American fixation on economic oppression. Though Rachel is a markedly less likeable character than Chuck, Hans eventually, inevitably follows her back to London. He loses touch with his Trinidadian friend who is discovered, years later, simply a body, handcuffed and disposed of in the Gowanus Canal.|$|E
