500|$|Epstein's {{death in}} August 1967 left the Beatles without management; Starr remarked: [...] " [...] a strange time <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> <b>when</b> it's someone who've relied {{on in the}} business, where we never got involved." [...] Soon afterwards, the band began an ill-fated film project, Magical Mystery Tour. Starr's growing {{interest}} in photography at the time led to his billing as the movie's Director of Photography, and his participation in the film's editing was matched only by McCartney.|$|E

[...] "You know a bomb could go off at any minute, but you never know just when it's going to happen, so the ideas of [...] Hitchcock—about making your {{audience}} anxious—were influential <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>when</b> we did the editing."The raw footage was described as a [...] "hodge-podge of disconnected, nausea-inducing motion that was constantly crossing the 180-degree line".|$|E
500|$|Prior to the series, Bobrov {{held a press}} luncheon in Moscow. He {{refused to}} {{consider}} that either team would sweep the series. To him, Team Canada had [...] "the fire power, know-how and goaltending", but how would it adapt to international rules, two-referee system and amateur officials? He conceded that Phil Esposito would [...] "be difficult {{to move from the}} front of the net. I expect there will be some surprises <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>when</b> we meet your Canadian stars." [...] He also predicted that Valeri Kharlamov [...] "will stand out, even against your best Canadians. By North American standards, he is small but he has an excellent shot. I think he will be effective." [...] Sinden was aware of Kharlamov and he selected Ron Ellis to the Team Canada roster especially to cover Kharlamov.|$|E

500|$|Following their Edinburgh Fringe shows, {{the group}} enjoyed {{considerable}} {{success in the}} United Kingdom, making appearances on numerous BBC comedy shows. In 1988, the group was nominated for the Perrier Comedy Award for their performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Fidler says that the British people were more receptive to their act at the time than Australians had been. [...] "The whole thing exploded <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>when</b> we got there, it was quite incredible. Within {{a very short time}} we were doing national television appearances in front of millions of people and playing these enormous shows," [...] he says. They played extensively in Canada, Germany, America and Britain, and finished their time in Britain by appearing on the final episode of the successful Friday Night Live. However, despite the acclaim they were receiving overseas, when they returned to Australia at the end of 1988 they remained unknown. Upon arriving in Melbourne, they struggled to gain a following and went back to busking on the streets.|$|E
500|$|On November 16, 2009, {{the paper}} was {{abruptly}} shut down because of the financial status of its parent company, Window Media, and its majority shareholder, Avalon Equity Partners. [...] Employees at the Blade were aware of Window Media's financial troubles, but the timing and total closure of the publication {{came as a shock}} to the entire staff. [...] Kevin Naff, editor of the Blade, said employees [...] "found out when two of the corporate officers were waiting <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>when</b> we got to work this morning". [...] Since the Blade had been a profitable newspaper, and because the debt-ridden Window Media was no longer draining the publication's finances, the same day the Blade shut down, Naff told the Washington City Paper he and the remaining staffers [...] "We're all together. Our first meeting for our new venture is tomorrow morning." [...] Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton said the Blade had been a [...] "weekly must-read", and pledged support for a new publication to serve Washington's LGBT community.|$|E
500|$|In February 2010 when {{accompanying}} the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, he said [...] "We feel that Saudi Arabia {{has a long}} and close relationship with Pakistan, that makes Saudi Arabia even more a valuable interlocutor <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> <b>When</b> we tell them about our experience, Saudi Arabia listens as somebody who is {{not in any way}} an enemy of Pakistan, but a friend of Pakistan and, therefore, will listen with sympathy and concern to a matter of this nature". He was asked whether India expected Saudi Arabia, given its close ties with Islamabad, to help address the terror threat from Pakistan. The remark about Saudi Arabia being a [...] "valuable interlocutor" [...] raised a strong reaction within the Indian political circle. The Pakistani press even went on to report that he had proposed that Saudi Arabia play a mediator's role in improving India's relationship with Pakistan. In response, Tharoor denied that 'interlocutor' meant 'mediator', and tweeted an explanation, saying, [...] "An [...] is someone you speak to. If I speak to you, you are my interlocutor. I mentioned the Saudis as our interlocutors, i.e. the people we are here to speak to".|$|E

500|$|Marvel Studios {{developed}} specific {{business practices}} to create its shared universe, including choosing filmmakers that were considered [...] "out-of-left-field", given their previous work. Feige remarked, [...] "You don't {{have to have}} directed a big, giant visual-effects movie to do a big, giant visual-effects movie for us. You just have to have done something singularly sort of awesome," [...] adding [...] "It's worked out well <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>when</b> we've taken people [...] that have done very, very good things. Very rarely are one of those good things a big giant blockbuster superhero movie." [...] When hiring directors, the studio usually has [...] "a kernel of {{an idea of what}} we want", which is presented to potential directors {{over the course of several}} meetings to discuss and further expand. [...] "And if over the course of three or four or five meetings they make it way better than what we initially were spewing to them, they usually get the job", according to Feige. Later expanding on this process, Feige explained that before talking to any directors on a film, Marvel Studios often puts together a [...] "lookbook" [...] of influences from the comics and art by Marvel's visual development department, to create a visual template for the film. These are put together at company retreats, which the studio holds every [...] "18 months or so" [...] to plan out and develop the phases of the MCU. These lookbooks are not always shown to directors, though, with Marvel sometimes preferring to let the director offer their own ideas first.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} statement expresses Wilcox's unique blending of New Thought, Spiritualism, and a Theosophical belief in reincarnation: [...] "As we think, act, and live here today, we build {{the structures of}} our homes in spirit realms after we leave earth, and we build karma for future lives, thousands of years to come, on this earth or other planets. Life will assume new dignity, and labor new interest <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> <b>when</b> {{we come to the}} knowledge that death is but a continuation of life and labor, in higher planes." ...|$|E
