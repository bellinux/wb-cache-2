5|$|Liquids can {{interact}} with two main types of solid surfaces. Traditionally, solid surfaces have been divided into high-energy solids and low-energy types. The relative {{energy of a}} solid <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bulk nature of the solid itself. Solids such as metals, glasses, and ceramics are known as 'hard solids' because the chemical bonds that hold them together (e.g., covalent, ionic, or metallic) are very strong. Thus, it takes a large input of energy to break these solids (alternatively {{large amount of energy}} is required to cut the bulk and make two separate surfaces so high surface energy), so they are termed “high energy”. Most molecular liquids achieve complete wetting with high-energy surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Throughout history, {{mothers have}} been portrayed {{as the primary}} {{physical}} caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes tasks such as breast-feeding and changing diapers. Some theorize that this <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea of women as having a natural instinct towards motherhood. Fathers, on the other hand, have been {{more likely to be}} portrayed in play activities with their children and are often more likely to be shown interacting with sons than daughters.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignments {{can also}} be used to identify functionally important sites, such as binding sites, active sites, or sites corresponding to other key functions, by locating conserved domains. When looking at multiple sequence alignments, it is useful to consider different aspects of the sequences when comparing sequences. These aspects include identity, similarity, and homology. Identity means that the sequences have identical residues at their respective positions. On the other hand, similarity <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sequences being compared having similar residues quantitatively. For example, in terms of nucleotide sequences, pyrimidines are considered similar to each other, as are purines. Similarity ultimately leads to homology, in that the more similar sequences are, the closer they are to being homologous. This similarity in sequences can then go on to help find common ancestry.|$|E

25|$|Even {{in modern}} Turkey, however, Ottoman Divan poetry {{is a highly}} {{specialist}} subject. Much of this <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fact that Divan poetry is written in Ottoman Turkish, which was written using {{a variant of the}} Arabic script and made extensive use of Arabic and Persian words, making the language vastly different from modern Turkish. In its own time, knowledge of this form of literary Turkish was largely limited to the educated classes.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the {{controversy}} with the scheme <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> proposed one-time premium payment.

Many critics of the proposal claim that it is just not possible to support the scheme with a one-time premium since the sustainability of the scheme would not be possible if premiums were not paid yearly.|$|E

25|$|Nominative–accusative {{alignment}} {{can also}} be distinguished through behavioral properties, {{in the way a}} nominative or accusative argument will behave when placed in particular syntactic constructions. This <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> impact of alignment on the level of the whole sentence rather than the individual word. Morphosyntactic alignment determines which arguments can be omitted in a coordinate structure during the process of conjunction reduction (deleting arguments from the ends of joined clauses). In nominative–accusative, only arguments S and A can be omitted and not argument O.|$|E
25|$|Logic and the {{philosophy}} of language are closely related. Philosophy of language <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> study of how our language engages and interacts with our thinking. Logic has an immediate impact on other areas of study. Studying logic {{and the relationship between}} logic and ordinary speech can help a person better structure his own arguments and critique the arguments of others. Many popular arguments are filled with errors because so many people are untrained in logic and unaware of how to formulate an argument correctly.|$|E
25|$|Lighting {{instruments}} can be broadly {{separated into}} two categories: floodlights, which illuminate a wide area, and spotlights (sometimes known as profiles), which produce a narrower, more controllable light beam. The distinction <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{characteristics of the}} light produced by the instrument. Spotlights produce a potentially tightly focused light, while floodlights produce a much more diffuse light. Instruments that fall {{somewhere in the middle}} of the spectrum can be classified as either a spot or a flood, depending on the type of instrument and how it is used.|$|E

He was a member of Painters Eleven, the group founded by William Ronald in 1954 to promote abstract painting in Canada, and was soon encouraged in his art by the American art critic Clement Greenberg. With encouragement from Greenberg, Bush became closely tied to two movements that grew out of the efforts of the abstract expressionists: Color Field Painting and Lyrical Abstraction. His painting Big A is an example of his color field paintings of the late 1960s.|$|R

25|$|The {{cause is}} unknown, but {{is thought to}} result from {{abnormalities}} of the veins inside the testicles, leading to a backup of blood that cannot flow, which in turn causes swelling. There are three main theories as to the anatomical cause; the first <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> geometry of the veins, wherein the vein {{on the left side}} connects to the larger outflowing vein at a right angle, which tends to fail; the second is that valves that are supposed to prevent backflow fail (venous insufficiency); the third is that pressure in upstream arteries creates a “nutcracker” syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Consistent {{with the}} broader scope of systems engineering, the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK) has defined {{three types of}} systems engineering: (1) Product Systems Engineering (PSE) is the {{traditional}} systems engineering focused {{on the design of}} physical systems consisting of hardware and software. (2) Enterprise Systems Engineering (ESE) pertains to the view of enterprises, that is, organizations or combinations of organizations, as systems. (3) Service Systems Engineering (SSE) <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> engineering of service systems. Checkland defines a service system as a system which is conceived as serving another system. Most civil infrastructure systems are service systems.|$|E
25|$|Like Plato, Mazzoni {{was very}} {{concerned}} with determining the purpose of poetry (Weinberg, 324). For him, its purpose is to “move the reader to pleasure and delight {{in the perception of}} the believable images.” Essentially, for Mazzoni, the purpose of poetry is recreation and pleasure; however, he also attaches a concept he calls “civil faculty.” In part, this <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> idea that taking a break from serious business (i.e., by creating or consuming poetry) allows one to return to that business afterwards with renewed enthusiasm. Mazzoni also says, however, that there is a distinct pleasure in poetry which, in addition to its ability to delight, carries with it a concealed lesson, moral, or other element that allows it to contribute to the improvement of society.|$|E

25|$|The second {{department}} has four sections, {{the head of}} {{each of which is}} a secretary: the first section <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> clergy; the second, with the convents of women; the third with the schools, colleges and other institutions for education in the city; the fourth with the brotherhoods, unions, and social societies. All four sections are subordinate first to the vicar and next to the assessor. The powers of the first section are laid down in details in twelve ordinances. Mention should be made of the stringent rule that no clergyman, regardless of whether he belongs to the Roman clergy or to another diocese, can be called to an office or a benefice by anyone, even a cardinal, unless it has been previously established by a secret letter to the vicar that the vicariate has no objection to his appointment. This regulation puts an end finally to an old abuse of historic growth which in past times led to much that was disadvantageous.|$|E
25|$|Wilfred Bion's {{observations}} {{about the role}} of group processes in group dynamics are set out in Experiences in Groups and other papers, written in the 1940s but compiled and published in 1961, where he refers to recurrent emotional states of groups as 'basic assumptions'. Bion argues that in every group, two groups are actually present: the work group, and the basic assumption group. The work group is that aspect of group functioning which <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> primary task of the group—what the group has formed to accomplish; will 'keep the group anchored to a sophisticated and rational level of behaviour'. The basic assumption group describes the tacit underlying assumptions on which the behaviour of the group is based. Bion specifically identified three basic assumptions: dependency, fight-flight, and pairing. When a group adopts any one of these basic assumptions, it interferes with the task the group is attempting to accomplish. Bion believed that interpretation by the therapist of this aspect of group dynamics would, whilst being resisted, also result in potential insight regarding effective, co-operative group work.|$|E
25|$|One might further {{hypothesize that}} the {{experimental}} treatment regulates cholesterol, because the treatment seems to selectively regulate genes associated with cholesterol. While {{this may be}} true, {{there are a number}} of reasons why making this a firm conclusion based on enrichment alone represents an unwarranted leap of faith. One previously mentioned issue <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> observation that gene regulation may have no direct impact on protein regulation: even if the proteins coded for by these genes do nothing other than make cholesterol, showing that their mRNA is altered does not directly tell us what is happening at the protein level. It is quite possible that the amount of these cholesterol-related proteins remains constant under the experimental conditions. Second, even if protein levels do change, perhaps there is always enough of them around to make cholesterol as fast as it can be possibly made, that is, another protein, not on our list, is the rate determining step in the process of making cholesterol. Finally, proteins typically play many roles, so these genes may be regulated not because of their shared association with making cholesterol but because of a shared role in a completely independent process.|$|E
