40|$|Abstract: Previous IOF method {{misses the}} {{overtaking}} vehicle when it just enters BSZ(Blind Spot Zone). Because the overtaking vehicle {{is very small}} in the image, we can’t use the lower <b>part</b> <b>edge</b> of vehicle. In this paper, we suggest how to solve that problem. we estimate the edge’s direction angle in both real image and prediction image. If the difference of two is lower than threshold value, we remove real image’s edge. After edge removing, we apply CC to real image and connect lower <b>part</b> <b>edges</b> and side <b>part</b> <b>edges</b> of vehicle. Using these additional side <b>part</b> <b>edges,</b> we can determine whether the overtaking vehicle is in BSZ or not...|$|R
