40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} an <b>integral</b> indicator <b>construction</b> algorithm. The <b>integral</b> indicator is a linear {{combination of the}} object features. The features are in the linear scale. Outliers in the features are assumed. So the problem of stable <b>integral</b> indicators <b>construction</b> arises. To construct a stable integral indicator a special-defined subset of the objects is selected. A non-supervised type of algorithm is {{used to make the}} integral indicator.

50|$|Hotchkiss {{had made}} 2.700 cars in 1951. The Grégoire design had <b>integral</b> <b>construction,</b> {{independent}} suspension all round, a 2.2 Litre flat-four engine and front wheel drive. Claimed top speed was 95 mph. Buyers did not welcome its smooth shape. Endless teething troubles brought production {{to a complete}} standstill in 1952. Hotchkiss produced 230 cars of all their models in 1953. When the factory finally closed there had been just 250 Hotchkiss-Grégoires built. In 1955 Citroen introduced the DS19 and Peugeot its 403. Aside from the Grégoire design Hotchmiss could only offer pre-war designs. Export sales were limited by the failure to provide left-hand-drive cars.|$|E
40|$|<b>Integral</b> {{abutment}} <b>construction</b> {{has become}} a popular alternative to conventional bridge construction for short and intermediate length bridges. <b>Integral</b> abutment <b>construction</b> eliminates joints and bearings which reduce long-term maintenance costs. However, {{in the absence of}} joints and bearings, the bridge abutments and foundations must be able to accommodate lateral movements from thermal expansion and contraction of the superstructure and from seismic events. Previous research has focused on the response to thermal expansion and contraction. The current research examines the response of integral abutment bridges to seismic loading. A field investigation was conducted to examine the response of an integral abutment to lateral loading from thermal expansion and contraction. The results were used to calibrate analytical bridge models used to estimate displacements of the abutment during design seismic events. A laboratory investigation was conducted to estimate the lateral displacement capacity of the abutment based on the performance of the abutment-pile connection. Results of the field, analytical, and laboratory investigations were used to evaluate allowable bridge lengths based on seismic performance. Alternate abutment-pile connection details are proposed which will increase seismic performance. ...|$|R

5000|$|The Titan was {{conceived}} in 1973 as project B15 and {{was intended as}} a replacement for the Bristol VRT, Daimler Fleetline and Leyland Atlantean. Following the success of the single-decker Leyland National, it was decided, from the outset, that the vehicle would be very standardised and of <b>integral</b> <b>construction.</b> This allowed more flexibility in the location of mechanical components and allowed a reduced step-height. The move away from body-on-chassis construction caused concern for the bodybuilders, who had already lost market share to the Leyland National. Talks regarding licensing agreements were held with Alexander and Northern Counties, both major suppliers to their respective local markets, but no agreements were reached.|$|E
50|$|The MCI 102DL3 and MCI D4500 are {{identical}} intercity bus models manufactured by Motor Coach Industries at their plant in Pembina, North Dakota, United States.

It was the first successful 45 foot coach in service and {{is among the most}} popular intercity coaches in North America. The coach uses MCI's special platform <b>integral</b> <b>construction,</b> which has come to dominate the US and Canada markets, allowing high durability and easy maintenance.

The old separate chassis had gone, replaced by <b>integral</b> <b>construction,</b> and coil independent front suspension supplanted the transverse leaf spring. Girling hydraulic brakes were fitted, initially 7 in drums but quickly increased to 8 in A new side-valve engine of 1172 cc engine was fitted having the same bore, stroke and layout of the previous engine, but in all other respects completely different - changes included adjustable tappets, raising the compression ratio from 6.3:1 to 7:1 and larger inlet valves, resulting in the power output increasing by 20% to 36 bhp.|$|E

He also discovered an alternative to Feynman's time-sliced path <b>integral</b> <b>construction</b> which can be used to solve the path integral formulations of the hydrogen atom and the centrifugal barrier, i.e. to calculate their energy levels and eigenstates, as special cases of a general strategy for treating systems with singular potentials using path integrals.|$|E
50|$|The power {{cars were}} fitted with an English Electric 560 HP diesel engine, with {{electric}} transmission to two traction motors {{mounted on the}} rear bogie. The seating capacity of the power cars was 45, however after providing for wheelchair accommodation, this was reduced to 42. The vehicle also incorporated a guards/parcel compartment. The intermediate coaches were fitted with an additional door on each side to aid passenger flow and had a capacity of 87. The driving trailers had a small cab built at one end, which necessitated the removal of six seats. This cab was set to the left to preserve the gangway connection, so that two train sets could be coupled together and still allow passengers to travel between the trains. All three types are of <b>integral</b> <b>construction,</b> however the power cars, because of their weight, also have an underframe. They were similar to the UTA 70 Class, both mechanically and electrically.|$|E
