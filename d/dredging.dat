5|$|After the Gold Rush had concluded, gold {{recovery}} operations continued. The final stage to recover loose gold was to prospect for gold that had slowly washed {{down into the}} flat river bottoms and sandbars of California's Central Valley and other gold-bearing areas of California (such as Scott Valley in Siskiyou County). By the late 1890s, <b>dredging</b> technology (also invented in California) had become economical, and {{it is estimated that}} more than 20million ounces (620t) were recovered by <b>dredging</b> (worth approximately US$28billion at December 2010 prices).|$|E
5|$|A marina {{was started}} in 1979 by <b>dredging</b> the upper harbour and laying pontoons. Light {{industry}} and car parks occupy the adjacent land. More pontoons were completed in 1991 and 1995. The Whitby Marina Facilities Centre was opened in June 2010.|$|E

5|$|After the Civil War, the Corps of Engineers {{undertook}} {{a program of}} river and harbor improvements. Raynolds supervised the <b>dredging</b> and improvement of navigation on the Arkansas, Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. He also helped supervise several harbor <b>dredging</b> and construction projects, involving the harbor in Buffalo, New York, the Harbor of Refuge in New Buffalo, Michigan, Erie Harbor in Erie, Pennsylvania, and the river harbors of St. Louis, Missouri and Alton, Illinois. Raynolds sited and oversaw the installation of dozens of lighthouses in the Great Lakes area, where he served as the superintending engineer from 1864 to 1870. Raynolds was promoted to permanent rank of lieutenant colonel in the Corps of Engineers on March 7, 1867. He then supervised lighthouse construction along the Gulf Coast and in New Jersey where he managed {{the construction of the}} Hereford Inlet Lighthouse in 1874. From May 5 to October 7, 1877, Reynolds led a procession of American engineers to an engineering conference in Europe.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20thcentury, the {{difficulty}} of navigating the Columbia was seen as an impediment to the economic development of the Inland Empire region east of the Cascades. The <b>dredging</b> and dam building that followed would permanently alter the river, disrupting its natural flow but also providing electricity, irrigation, navigability and other benefits to the region.|$|E
5|$|Efforts to {{maintain}} and improve the navigation channel have continued to the present day. In 1990 {{a new round of}} studies examined the possibility of further <b>dredging</b> on the lower Columbia. The plans were controversial from the start because of economic and environmental concerns.|$|E

5|$|In 2012 the Docks {{directly}} employed 23 full-time employees, {{but this}} does not include people working as crews on the <b>dredging</b> vessels or pilots based at Barry. The docks had 114 tenants in 2003, which had fallen to 103 tenants in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The island's soil is {{composed}} primarily of volcanic material, lagoonal deposits and coralline debris, with silty sand from the <b>dredging.</b> Its volcanic material is Aeolian ash, weathered tuff and basalt. Ford Island proper is a coral outcrop. There are two smaller islets near the island: Mokunui and Mokuiki.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} operation {{was guided by}} the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) with resources from the Canadian Forces, Canadian Coast Guard, RCMP, and other agencies. The area was surveyed using route survey sonar, laser line scanners, and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to locate items. After being located, the debris was then recovered (initially by divers and ROVs, later by <b>dredging</b> and trawling).|$|E
50|$|A fishing <b>dredge,</b> {{also known}} as a scallop <b>dredge</b> or oyster <b>dredge,</b> is a kind of <b>dredge</b> which is towed along {{the bottom of the sea}} by a fishing boat in order to collect a {{targeted}} edible bottom-dwelling species. The gear is used to fish for scallops, oysters and other species of clams, crabs, and sea cucumber. The <b>dredge</b> is then winched up into the boat and emptied. <b>Dredges</b> are also used in connection with the work of the naturalist in marine biology, notably on the Challenger Expedition.|$|R
40|$|Beneficial reuse of <b>dredged</b> {{material}} requires proper engineering design, {{protection of}} {{human health and the}} environment, and regulatory acceptance. Beneficial use of <b>dredged</b> material {{is an integral part of}} the <b>dredge</b> material management process. Clean <b>dredged</b> material can be used for construction fill, topsoil, wetland mitigation projects. Slightly to moderately contaminated material may be acceptable for upland fill beneath a parking lot, for creation of a soil berm around a <b>dredge</b> material dewatering facility, or daily cover at a landfill. The purpose of this paper is to identify the regulatory programs and requirements for <b>dredged</b> material beneficial reuse in an upland environment. This paper will describe the transition of the material from an in-water regulatory program to an upland regulatory program; to properly and beneficially manage the <b>dredged</b> material. <b>Dredged</b> material is typically regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA). The EPA Office of Water regulates <b>dredged</b> material that is managed under the CWA.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1881, {{industrialists}} proposed altering the natural channel of the Columbia to improve navigation. Changes {{to the river}} {{over the years have}} included the construction of jetties at the river's mouth, <b>dredging,</b> and the construction of canals and navigation locks. Today, ocean freighters can travel upriver as far as Portland and Vancouver, and barges can reach as far inland as Lewiston, Idaho.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1960s, the power stations' {{operating}} hours were decreased due {{to the opening of}} the much larger Blyth power station in Northumberland. This meant that less ash was produced by the Stella and Dunston stations; so {{by the end of the}} 1960s, the CEGB sold Hexhamshire Lass and Bobby Shaftoe. The former went to a firm in Fareham, Hampshire, where it worked as a sand dredger until scrapped in 1993; the latter to a French <b>dredging</b> company.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} earlier {{construction}} of nearby Battersea Bridge, during excavations workers found large quantities of Roman and Celtic weapons and skeletons in the riverbed, leading many historians {{to conclude that the}} area was the site of Julius Caesar's crossing of the Thames during the 54 BC invasion of Britain. The most significant item found was the Celtic La Tène style bronze and enamel Battersea Shield, {{one of the most important}} pieces of Celtic military equipment found in Britain, recovered from the riverbed during <b>dredging</b> for the piers.|$|E
50|$|Dredgers {{are often}} {{equipped}} with <b>dredge</b> monitoring software {{to help the}} <b>dredge</b> operator position the dredger and monitor the current <b>dredge</b> level. The monitoring software often uses Real Time Kinematic satellite navigation to accurately record where the machine has been operating and to what depth the machine has <b>dredged</b> to.|$|R
50|$|This process {{functions}} like a cutter suction dredger, but {{the cutting tool}} is a rotating Archimedean screw set {{at right angles to}} the suction pipe. The first widely used auger <b>dredges</b> were designed in the 1980s by Mud Cat <b>Dredges,</b> which was run by National Car Rental, but is now a Division of Ellicott <b>Dredges.</b> In 1996, IMS <b>Dredges</b> introduced a self-propelled version of the auger <b>dredge</b> that allows the system to propel itself without the use of anchors or cables. During the 1980s and 1990s auger <b>dredges</b> were primarily used for sludge removal applications from waste water treatment plants. Today, auger <b>dredges</b> are used for a wider variety of applications including river maintenance and sand mining.|$|R
5000|$|The Chatanika gold <b>dredge</b> is a {{historic}} relic of gold <b>dredge</b> #3 {{owned and operated by}} F.E. Company between 1928 and 1958. The <b>dredge</b> is located at about 27.5 mi along the Steese Highway east of Fairbanks in a 60 acre pond it dug itself, directly across the road from the Chatanika Lodge. Today the <b>dredge</b> is private property and off-limits to the public. In August 2013 an accidental fire destroyed the <b>dredge.</b>|$|R
5|$|Destruction and {{encroachment}} {{of habitat}} by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, {{forcing them to}} nest closer to the surf. Urbanization often leads to the siltation of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and <b>dredging</b> degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles {{at or near the}} surface.|$|E
5|$|During the 1850s {{and again}} after his {{participation}} in the American Civil War, Raynolds was the head engineer on numerous lighthouse construction projects. He oversaw riverway and harbor <b>dredging</b> projects intended to improve accessibility and navigation for shipping. As a cartographer, Raynolds surveyed and mapped the islands and shorelines on the Great Lakes and other regions. At least six lighthouses whose construction he oversaw are still standing. Some are still in use and of these, several are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} {{is caused}} by a number of human activities. Marine mammals that live in coastal environments {{are most likely to be}} affected by habitat degradation and loss. Developments such as sewage marine outfalls, moorings, <b>dredging,</b> blasting, dumping, port construction, hydroelectric projects, and aquaculture both degrade the environment and take up valuable habitat. For example, extensive shellfish aquaculture takes up valuable space used by coastal marine mammals for important activities such as breeding, foraging and resting.|$|E

5000|$|Calumet and Hecla {{used the}} <b>dredge</b> at their Lake Linden Reclamation Plant until 1951. [...] In 1951, the Quincy Mine {{purchased}} the <b>dredge</b> and designated {{it as their}} Quincy <b>Dredge</b> Number Two, using it at their own reclamation facility, which had been in operation since 1943. [...] The mine's Quincy <b>Dredge</b> Number One sank in 1956, and <b>Dredge</b> Number Two was used until 1967, when it too sank during a winter lay-up. [...] By this time, copper prices had fallen low enough that the reclamation process was not profitable, and the Quincy Mine abandoned both the <b>dredge</b> and its reclamation facility.|$|R
5|$|In 1901, Beebe {{returned}} to Nova Scotia {{on his first}} expedition for the zoo, {{with the goal of}} collecting marine animals by searching tide pools and with additional <b>dredging.</b> The following year he was promoted from assistant curator to the rank of full curator, a post he held until 1918. He then went on to serve as an honorary curator from 1919 to 1962.|$|E
5|$|Redfish and trout {{were once}} the main {{species of fish}} living in the lake, until the {{construction}} of an embankment reduced their populations. A large quantity of silt is now deposited in the lake from the Guadalupe River, after the <b>dredging</b> of a freshwater channel that supplies farmers and the Union Carbide plant in Seadrift. The channel has negatively affected the delta ecosystem by diminishing the river's nutritional input.|$|E
5|$|The City of Bridgeport {{appointed}} a bridge commission {{to replace the}} aging East Washington Avenue Bridge on December 7, 1915. The commission chose a Joseph B. Strausss patented design from the Strauss Bascule Bridge Company of Chicago, Illinois. The city engineer James A. McElroy drew up {{the plans for the}} bridge's specifications and the plans were completed on February 17, 1916. The steel for the construction was ordered from the Penn Bridge Company. The project was suspended because of a dispute with the contractor and a lack of funds to erect the bridge, but in 1923 the State of Connecticut appropriated $350,000 to complete the project. Only two bids for the bridge's erection were placed, the first by Bridgeport Dry Dock and <b>Dredging</b> for $326,575 and the second by C. W. Blakeslee and Sons for $389,492 with estimations varying based on extra work needed. Bridgeport Dry Dock and <b>Dredging</b> won the contract and the materials were shipped to Bridgeport, with work beginning mid-1924. The completed bridge included an operator's house and a public toilet building. The bridge, costing over $550,000 in total, was turned over to the city on October 14, 1925.|$|E
