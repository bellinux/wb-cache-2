The following year, the woman became a Poulidor-iste. But it was too late. The husband had switched his allegiance to Gimondi. The last I heard they were digging in their heels and the neighbours were complaining.|$|E

The Recruit, released in 2003, featured Pacino as a CIA recruiter and co-stars Colin Farrell. The film received mixed reviews, and has been described by Pacino as something he [...] "personally couldn't follow". Pacino next starred as lawyer Roy Cohn in the 2003 HBO miniseries Angels in America, an adaptation of Tony Kushner's Pulitzer Prize winning play of the same name. For this performance, Pacino won his third Golden Globe, for Best Performance by an Actor, in 2004.|$|E

Styles P raps [...] "Past is the past, just let it be bygones / Matter of fact <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>a</b> fly song that we could vibe on", which Sanneh writes [...] "Cheerfully out of place, he sounds like a man who has wandered into the wrong summertime party, but so what?

500|$|During {{her teenage}} years, Sevigny became rebellious: [...] "I was very well-mannered, {{and my mother}} was very strict. But I did hang out at the Mobil station and smoke cigarettes." [...] Between her junior and senior year of high school, she shaved her head and sold her hair to a Broadway wigmaker. She openly {{admitted}} to using drugs as a teenager, especially hallucinogens. She has commented that her father was aware of her experimentation with hallucinogens and marijuana, and even told her that it was okay, but that she had [...] "to stop if she had bad trips". Despite her father's leniency, her mother later chose to send her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In 2007, she told The Times that [...] "I had a great family life [...] I would never want it to look as if it reflected on them. I think I was very bored, and I did just love taking hallucinogens... but I often feel it's because I experimented when I was younger that I have no interest as an adult. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>a</b> lot of adults who didn't, and it's much more dangerous when you start experimenting with drugs as an adult." [...] She often described herself as a [...] "loner" [...] and a [...] "depressed teenager". Her only extracurricular activity was occasionally skateboarding with her older brother, and she spent most of her free time in her bedroom: [...] "Mostly I sewed.

500|$|Music {{journalist}} Charles Shaar Murray {{likens the}} figure to a feminine ideal: [...] "Sometimes {{she is a}} spirit, sometimes a fantasy, sometimes a woman as solidly, palpably physical as he is". [...] The figure first appears as [...] "Waterfall" [...] in [...] "May This Be Love", where she offers solace and hope, and as [...] "a soulful, loving sprite" [...] in [...] "Little Wing". [...] However, other writers {{have suggested that the}} figure is similar to the guardian angel associated with Christianity, which is clearly what she represents in Hendrix's later song [...] "Angel". Hendrix's brother, Leon, interpreted [...] "Little Wing" [...] (and [...] "Angel") as a general tribute: [...] "He wrote it for his girlfriends, our aunties, and especially for our mama, who looked over us from high above in the afterlife". [...] Hendrix's hand-written lyrics for [...] "Angel" [...] (with the note, [...] "Finished January 14, 1968") use the title [...] "My Angel Catherina (Return of Little Wing)", which suggests that he saw a connection between the two songs. [...] At the time, Hendrix had just finished a short tour of Scandinavia, where he had performed [...] "Little Wing" [...] in concert for the first time. [...] At some point he responded to a question, [...] "Love? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>a</b> girl, Katerina, in Sweden." [...] In a later 1969 interview, Hendrix described his relationships while he was on tour: [...] "So like 'Little Wing' is like one of these beautiful girls that come around sometimes... She was a very sweet girl that came around that gave me her whole life and more if I wanted it. And me with my crazy ass couldn't get it together, so I'm off here and there and off over there." ...|$|E
