5|$|In Baldwin County, Alabama, a local {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared on November9 as Ida neared landfall. Voluntary <b>evacuations</b> were declared for residents living along coastal areas or in mobile homes. All government offices were closed until November10 due to the storm. The Baldwin County Coliseum was converted into a shelter to house possible evacuees during the storm as well. In Mississippi, officials advised residents to remain vigilant and discussed possible <b>evacuations.</b> Residents living near Pensacola Beach, Florida, and nearby Perdido Key were urged to evacuate. On November8, emergency officials declared a {{state of emergency}} in Escambia County. The following day, Walton County was also placed under a state of emergency ahead of Hurricane Ida's arrival. Voluntary <b>evacuations</b> were issued for residents in low-lying areas and all non-emergency offices were closed until November10.

In this paper, four principal aspects of current research into large-scale crowd <b>evacuation,</b> namely <b>evacuation</b> theories, <b>evacuation</b> modeling, <b>evacuation</b> decision-making and <b>evacuation</b> risk evaluation have been summarized.

40|$|Abstract. In {{emergencies}} such as fire, pedestrian <b>evacuation</b> for bad visibility {{is significantly}} different to the <b>evacuation</b> for normal visibility. In the novel <b>evacuation</b> model, {{the strategies of}} pedestrian <b>evacuation</b> and the moving rules are proposed. Then the formulas of the <b>evacuation</b> time are achieved and the time ratio is 0. 63. More, using the programming language, pedestrian <b>evacuation</b> is simulated and reproduced. The studies shows that the proposed <b>evacuation</b> model can well reflect the process of pedestrian evacuation; and the <b>evacuation</b> signs of reasonable design can significantly optimize the process. The calculation results also show that the ratio of <b>evacuation</b> time between considering <b>evacuation</b> signs and no <b>evacuation</b> signs is close to 0. 63 that is the theoretical results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: mutual {{influence}} of the double-hole tunnel <b>evacuation</b> of urban subways is one of key issues involving the subway construction safety. The asynchronous one-direction <b>evacuation,</b> synchronous one-direction <b>evacuation</b> and oppo-site <b>evacuation</b> methods are frequently used in double-hole tunnel <b>evacuation.</b> This paper establishes three-dimensional numerical model by using the finite element analysis software MIDAS/GTS v 2. 01 and mainly studies the mutual influ-ences of tunnels in the asynchronous one-direction <b>evacuation</b> and synchronous one-direction <b>evacuation.</b> The following conclusions are concluded based on computing. The preliminary conclusion is that the influential distance between the <b>evacuation</b> section of two tunnels is 3 D (D is the tunnel diameter) in the parallel tunnel asynchronous <b>evacuation,</b> namely when the lagging distance is more than 3 D, the lagging <b>evacuation</b> tunnel will not affect the advance <b>evacuation</b> tunnel section. The asynchronous <b>evacuation</b> of the vertical distribution tunnel is divided into the up tunnel first <b>evacuation</b> and down tunnel first <b>evacuation.</b> For up tunnel first <b>evacuation,</b> the influence range of the lagging distance is 5 D. For down tunnel first <b>evacuation,</b> the influence range of the lagging distance is 1 D. For up tunnel first <b>evacuation</b> on the slope, the influence range of the lagging distance is 5 D. On the whole, the influence of two tunnels in up tunnel first <b>evacuation</b> is bigger than it in down tunnel first <b>evacuation.</b> The numerical analysis results will have important theoretical meaning and application value for building technology of the parallel double-hole tunnel...|$|R
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September28, reports {{indicated}} that Juan would make landfall either as a tropical storm or marginal Category1 hurricane. Weather broadcasts {{up to that time}} gave every indication that the storm would weaken prior to landfall. By 6 p.m. ADT (2100 UTC), additional warnings had been issued since Juan was expected to make landfall as a strong Category1 or weak Category2 hurricane. Most businesses in the areas affected were closed on Sundays, which meant that preparations could not be made at the last minute. Although no large-scale <b>evacuations</b> were made, local <b>evacuations</b> for low-lying areas were issued on the evening of September 28. In all, several hundred people were affected by these <b>evacuations.</b> Utility workers also stood on standby before the storm hit, preparing for large-scale power outages.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Crowd <b>evacuation</b> {{simulations}} {{are useful}} tools for analyzing and assessing {{the safety of}} building occupants. Agent-based simulations provide a platform for computing individual as well as and collective behaviors in crowds. During an <b>evacuation,</b> {{it is well known}} that trained leaders or <b>evacuation</b> guides play a key role in saving human lives. In this paper, we propose an <b>evacuation</b> simulation system where agents are guided by <b>evacuation</b> orders from authorities. The simulations captured typical behaviors observed during crowd <b>evacuation.</b> For example, the total <b>evacuation</b> time was reduced when most of the agents followed the guidance, although the <b>evacuation</b> times of individual agents were different. When a specific agent is involved in the movement of other agents to a different destination, the <b>evacuation</b> takes a longer amount of time. The simulation appears to depict real-life situations well, which shows that simulations can be a useful tool to estimate <b>evacuation</b> situations prior to emergency <b>evacuation</b> drills...|$|R
