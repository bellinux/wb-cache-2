5000|$|<b>Initial</b> <b>coin</b> <b>offering</b> (ICO) is an {{unregulated}} {{means of}} crowdfunding via cryptocurrency. The term is often confused with 'token sale' or crowdsale, {{which refers to}} a method of selling participation in an economy, giving investors access to the features of a particular project starting at a later date. ICOs, on the other hand, sell a right of ownership or royalties to a project. According to Amy Wan, a partner at Trowbridge Sidoti LLP practicing crowdfunding and syndication law, “The coin in an ICO {{is a symbol of}} ownership interest in an enterprise—a digital stock certificate, if you will.” In contrast to initial public offerings (IPOs), where investors gain shares in the ownership of the company, for ICOs the investors buy coins of the company, which can appreciate in value if the business is successful.|$|E
30|$|The Ethereum {{technology}} is quickly gaining consensus among developers as the reference {{platform for the}} implementation of a socio-technical ecosystem where technological applications and services are no more based on trust among parties. Hundreds of new technological companies nowadays propose services based on smart contracts, together with innovative solutions for user privacy and data management with high potential impact on society and technology. These companies often attract investors through crowdfunding operations known as <b>initial</b> <b>coin</b> <b>offering</b> (ICO). During an ICO, tokens – instead of shares, as in IPOs – are sold before the corresponding Dapp is released. ICOs are still not regulated like IPOs and token-holders, as opposed to share-holders, have little or no decisional power at all in the company.|$|E

30|$|In {{these early}} days of {{distributed}} ledgers and tokens secured by cryptographic methods, DAOs remain rare. Some organizers have raised money via <b>initial</b> <b>coin</b> <b>offerings</b> (ICOs), exchanging tokens for cash. These tokens secure voting and perhaps usage rights for projects that range from explicit to vague. For instance, an ICO can be pledged {{to the development of}} a software program. Token buyers may be compensated by low-cost or privileged access to the program as users. They may also have rights to participate revenues earned by the program, and they may be compensated for contributions to the software. Token holders may or may not have voting rights that govern how the software is developed. A central, hierarchical organization could also make those decisions, with the token’s value depending on the quality of those choices and how well they are executed.|$|R
40|$|We analyze two {{families}} of three-state quantum walks which show the localization effect. We {{focus on the}} role of the <b>initial</b> <b>coin</b> state and its coherence in controlling the properties of the quantum walk. In particular, we show that the description of the walk simplifies considerably when the <b>initial</b> <b>coin</b> state is decomposed in the basis formed by the eigenvectors of the coin operator. This allows us to express the limit distributions in a much more convenient form. Consequently, striking features which are hidden in the standard basis description are easily identified. Moreover, the dependence of moments of the position distribution on the <b>initial</b> <b>coin</b> state can be analyzed in full detail. In particular, we find that in the eigenvector basis the even moments and the localization probability at the origin depend only on incoherent combination of probabilities. In contrast, odd moments and localization outside the origin are affected by the coherence of the <b>initial</b> <b>coin</b> state...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{reproduce}} the DTQW evolution with initial state ρ̂_pc(0) in Eq. (5), we propose the following approach: a first coin operation is implemented to generate the state |ϕ〉_c. This can be done through a 50 : 50 beam splitter (i.e. we set the reflectivity ratio θ= π/ 4). The outputs are then recombined to enter the first beam splitter of the walk [step 0 in Figure  6 (a)]. This {{is followed by the}} DTQW optical scheme, as in Figure  6 (a), where the beam splitters implementing the necessary series of coin tossing operations have a set reflectivity ratio of θ≪ 1. The process continues up to step N [cf. Figure  6 (b)]. In order to project on the <b>initial</b> <b>coin</b> state, after the final step, we project over the <b>initial</b> <b>coin</b> state inserting another row of beam splitters with θ= π/ 4 and detecting on the output corresponding to 1 /√(2)(| 0 〉+i| 1 〉).|$|R

40|$|We {{systematically}} {{study the}} localization effect in discrete-time quantum walks on a honeycomb network and establish the mathematical framework. We {{focus on the}} Grover walk first and rigorously derive the limit form of the walker's state, showing it has a certain probability to be localized at the starting position. The relationship between localization and the <b>initial</b> <b>coin</b> state is concisely represented by a linear map. We also define and calculate the average probability of localization by generating random <b>initial</b> states. Further, <b>coin</b> operators varying with positions are considered and the sufficient condition for localization is discussed. We also similarly analyze another four-state Grover walk. Theoretical predictions are all in accord with numerical simulation results.

Moreover, we get the time-averaged limit measure using the space-time generating function method. The measure is symmetric for the origin and independent of the <b>initial</b> <b>coin</b> state at the starting point. So localization depends only on the parameter which determines the model.

For infinite size of lattice, we derive an explicit expression for the return probability, which shows scaling behavior P(0,t) ∼ t^- 1 and does not depends on the initial states of the walk. In the long-time limit, the probability distribution shows various patterns, depending on the <b>initial</b> states, <b>coin</b> parameters and the lattice size. The average mixing time M_ϵ closes to the limiting probability in linear N (size of the lattice) for large values of thresholds ϵ.

We find that the eigenvectors of the coin result in an extremal regime of a quantum walk. The approach is illustrated on two examples of quantum walks on a line.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{asymptotic}} scaling of persistence of unvisited sites for quantum walks on a line. In {{contrast to the}} classical random walk there is no connection between the behaviour of persistence and the scaling of variance. In particular, we find that for a two-state quantum walks persistence follows an inverse power-law where the exponent is determined solely by the coin parameter. Moreover, for a one-parameter family of three-state quantum walks containing the Grover walk the scaling of persistence is given by two contributions. The first is the inverse power-law. The second contribution to the asymptotic behaviour of persistence is an exponential decay coming from the trapping nature of the studied family of quantum walks. In contrast to the two-state walks both the exponent of the inverse power-law and the decay constant of the exponential decay depend also on the <b>initial</b> <b>coin</b> state and its coherence. Hence, one can achieve various regimes of persistence by altering the initial condition, ranging from purely exponential decay to purely inverse power-law behaviour...|$|R

40|$|We study a discrete-time quantum walk (QW) on {{the line}} with a single phase at the origin which was {{introduced}} and studied by Wojcik et al. [1]. We call the model "Wojcik model" here. Konno et al. [2] investigated other types of QWs with one defect at the origin. They presented a method which gives the stationary measure corresponding to localization for the QWs by use of the generating functions splitted in positive and negative parts respectively. In this paper, we call the method "the splitted generating function method (the SGF method) ". To clarify in detail which QW is appropriate for the method in the case of study is one of the important challenges to investigate localization properties for various QWs. As for the Wojcik model, we solve the eigenvalue problem by the SGF method and our results agree with Ref. [1]. From the solution of the problem, we derive a stationary measure with an exponential decay for the position. The explicit expression for the stationary measure is symmetric for the origin and ensures localization depending on the <b>initial</b> <b>coin</b> state.
