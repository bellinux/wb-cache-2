50|$|The bad <b>feelings</b> <b>vanish</b> when Cleve, with Billy Hunter on his wing, shoots down a MiG. Both exultant and relieved, {{he learns}} at {{debriefing}} that Pell, too, has shot down a MiG and almost gotten DeLeo {{killed in the}} process: DeLeo accuses Pell of flying off on his own {{in the middle of}} the fight and leaving his leader to the mercies of the enemy. Pell denies the accusation and Cleve tries to smooth over the situation as a misunderstanding in the heat of battle. He discovers that his redemption is short-lived when, five days later, a big fight occurs after Cleve left himself off the schedule. The doubt and ominous fear return immediately. Then he finds that Pell has shot down another MiG. DeLeo remains hostile and skeptical of Pell, but Daughters confirms the kill.|$|E
60|$|Again {{he stayed}} through the evening, having quarrelled once {{more with the}} Maria about money. He quarrelled violently, yet coldly. There was {{something}} terrifying in it. And {{as soon as the}} matter of dispute was settled, all trace of interest or <b>feeling</b> <b>vanished</b> from him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I want you--I don't care--I want you!" [...] She {{felt him}} sway, reel, and clutch {{her as if}} he were going to fall, and all other <b>feeling</b> <b>vanished</b> in the {{instinct}} of the nurse she had already been to him. He was ill again! Yes, he was ill! And she said: ...|$|R
6000|$|He pointed resolutely to his {{candle and}} {{collected}} his mind, though {{he felt he}} did a foolish thing. [...] "Be raised up," [...] he said. But in a second that <b>feeling</b> <b>vanished.</b> The candle was raised, {{hung in the air}} one giddy moment, and as Mr. Fotheringay gasped, fell with a smash on his toilet-table, leaving him in darkness save for the expiring glow of its wick.|$|R
6000|$|Charmed {{with the}} experiment, he {{repeated}} it the following Sunday. This time he boarded the seat {{from the other}} end, and seeing no place by the captain, took one, or more correctly speaking made one, between Miss Nugent and Jack, and despite the former's elbow began to feel almost {{like one of the}} family. Hostile <b>feelings</b> <b>vanished,</b> and with an amiable smile at the half-frantic Miss Nugent he placed a [...] "bull's-eye" [...] of great strength in his cheek, and leaning forward for a hymn-book left one on the ledge in front of jack. A double-distilled perfume at once assailed the atmosphere.|$|R
60|$|To {{tell the}} truth, Mrs Kelly's courage waned {{from the moment}} of her leaving her own door, and it did not return till she felt herself within it again. Indeed, as she was leaving the gate of Dunmore House, with Anty on her arm, she was already {{beginning}} to repent what she was doing; for there were idlers about, and she felt ashamed of carrying off the young heiress. But these <b>feelings</b> <b>vanished</b> the moment she had crossed her own sill. When she had once got Anty home, it was all right. The widow Kelly seldom went out into the world; she seldom went anywhere except to mass; and, when out, she was a very modest and retiring old lady; but she could face the devil, if necessary, across her own counter.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{domestic}} <b>feeling</b> is fast <b>vanishing</b> {{among the}} working classes of this country," [...] said Gerard; [...] "nor is it wonderful--the Home no longer exists." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 11 a.m. Gave out my idea to the Ass Press. Tense <b>feeling</b> at Washington <b>vanished</b> {{instantly}} and utterly. Feeling now loose. In fact everything splendid. Money became easy at once. Marks rose. Exports jumped. Gold reserve swelled.|$|R
60|$|Mainwaring surmised in {{an instant}} that the trader's visit related somehow to news of Captain Scarfield, and as immediately, in the relief of {{something}} positive to face, all of his <b>feeling</b> of restlessness <b>vanished</b> like a shadow of mist. He gave orders that Captain Cooper should be immediately shown into the cabin, {{and in a few}} moments the tall, angular form of the Quaker skipper appeared in the narrow, lanthorn-lighted space.|$|R
60|$|It was evening, {{but the sun}} {{had still}} a {{considerable}} distance to descend before finding its bed on the western horizon. A faint gleam of day entered the cave, which was further illuminated by three fires, over which a band of savage-looking dark-skinned men were roasting chops and marrow-bones. Abdul Jemalee the Malay slave and Booby the Bushman were there, assisting at the feast. At the inner end of the cave, seated beside two men, was Ruyter the Hottentot. He {{was a good deal}} changed from the rough but careless and jolly fellow whom we first introduced to the reader. There was a stern severity on his countenance, coupled with a touch of sadness when in repose, but when called into action, or even when conversing, the softer <b>feeling</b> <b>vanished,</b> and nothing remained but the lines indicative of a stern settled purpose. Most of the robbers around him had like himself fled from harsh masters, and become hardened in a career of crime. The expression of almost every countenance was vindictive, sensual, coarse. Ruyter's was not so. Unyielding sternness alone marked his features, which, we have elsewhere remarked, were unusually good for a Hottentot. Being a man of superior power he had become the leader of this robber-band. It was only one of many that existed at that time among the almost inaccessible heights of the mountain-ranges bordering on the colony. His companions recognised the difference between themselves and their captain, and did not love him for it, though they feared him. They also felt that he was irrevocably one of themselves, having imbrued his hands in white man's blood more than once, and already made his name terrible on that part of the frontier.|$|R
50|$|Quark and Natima {{were once}} lovers {{and it is}} {{apparent}} as he follows her that she still has feelings for him. However, the second he starts to quote a Rule of Acquisition, any such <b>feelings</b> seem to <b>vanish.</b> Garak and Bashir pass by and Garak acknowledges Natima politely, prompting her to panic. She tells Sisko {{that she and her}} students must leave quickly, but O'Brien has discovered that her ship was actually damaged by Cardassian phaser-fire. Natima reveals they are political outcasts intent on reforming the oppressive Cardassian military government.|$|R
6000|$|I {{believed}} {{that all this}} morbid <b>feeling</b> would <b>vanish</b> if the chord of sympathy {{between him and his}} countrymen were touched. But my persuasions were vain, the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination. Shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion, with its mixture of good and evil, of disappointment and disquiet. Such opened again the wounds of his own heart; and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy, forgetting love and hate, and regret and lost hope, in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset, from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight, from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woods,--which celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines, the flow of a murmuring stream, and the thousand harmonious sounds which Nature creates in her solitudes. These are the materials which form the [...] "Witch of Atlas": it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered, and his fancy coloured, during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved.|$|R
6000|$|For a {{few minutes}} Numerian stood motionless, gazing wistfully in the {{direction}} taken by his companion on his departure. At first an expression of grief and pity softened the austerity which seemed the habitual characteristic of his countenance when in repose, but soon these milder and tenderer <b>feelings</b> appeared to <b>vanish</b> from his heart as suddenly as they had arisen; his features reassumed their customary sternness, and he muttered {{to himself as he}} mixed with the crowd struggling onwards {{in the direction of the}} basilica: 'Let him depart unregretted; he has denied himself to the service of his Maker. He should no longer be my friend.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Pendlebury was Director of Excavations at Tell el-Amarna from 1930 to 1936 and {{continued}} as Curator at Knossos until 1934. By {{then it was}} clear to the scholars and archaeologists who were {{on the board of the}} British School that he was spreading himself too thin. John had formulated a new plan, to write an archaeological guide to all of Crete. It required extensive explorations of all of Crete, which Pendlebury began in 1933. His successor at Knossos, R.W. Hutchinson, later wrote such a guide, which the board did not find objectionable, but in 1934 they wrote to Pendlebury stating that they had changed the terms of the Curatorship. From then on the Curator was [...] "not expected" [...] to conduct [...] "independent archaeological work out of reach of Knossos." [...] Complaining that the board had [...] "cracked the whip," [...] Pendlebury resigned. He was solicitous about indoctrinating his successor, R.W. Hutchinson, who arrived with his family in 1935. In that year Evans visited Knossos for the last time to attend the unveiling of his statue. The Pendleburys were also present. Hard <b>feelings</b> had <b>vanished.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "And I {{was drawn}} to the man himself. He worked {{extraordinary}} hours. In fact, I don’t think he sleeps more than an hour or two most nights. Here was a person who seemed to be practicing more than he preached, who seemed to be living, as nearly as any human being can, without hypocrisy. A challenging person, the kind of person whose example can irritate you by making you feel you’ve never done anything as important, and yet, in his presence, those kinds of <b>feelings</b> tended to <b>vanish.</b> In the past, when I’d imagined a person with credentials like his, I’d imagined someone dour and self-righteous, but he was very friendly and irreverent, and quite funny. He seemed like someone I’d like to know, and I thought that if I did my job well, a reader would feel that way, too." ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{a practice}} of nineteenth-century novelists which has often been mentioned by critics but never studied in detail - the setting of much of their work in a period {{a generation or two}} before the time of writing. Its main focus is on the fiction of George Eliot set in the recent past: Scenes of Clerical Life (1857 - 58), Adam Bede (1859), The Mill on the Floss (1860), Silas Marner (1861), Felix Holt, The Radical (1866), and Middlemarch (1871 - 72). However I begin by looking briefly at the pioneering novel in the field, Waverley (1814), and go on to discuss three more novels by Scott - Guy Mannering (1815), The Antiquary (1816) and Redgauntlet (1824) - as well as three by Thackeray: Vanity Fair (1847 - 48), Pendennis (1848 - 50) and The Newcomes (1853 - 55). Since I aim to discover the attitudes these writers adopted to the recent past, and conveyed to their first readers, this study involves discussion not only of the periods in which the novels are set, but also of the periods in which they were written, so as to establish the knowledge and preconceptions which the books' early readers brought to bear on the fiction. Where possible I quote the responses of actual contemporary readers, notably those of the early reviewers. This thesis draws attention to the various functions a setting in the recent past could serve in nineteenth-century fiction: to arouse nostalgic <b>feelings</b> for a <b>vanished</b> but remembered past, or sympathy {{for the people of the}} past, to point out that change is sometimes more apparent than real, to comment obliquely on contemporary issues, to highlight the unchanging features of human nature and human predicaments, to examine the role of the individual in effecting change. </p...|$|R
