40|$|Microwave-microfluidics is an {{emerging}} research area about {{the integration of}} microwave circuits with microfluidics. Microfluidics is the science and technology of manipulation of tiny amounts of fluids in um channels and it is being developed to provide technology platforms for high-speed, low reagent consumption, and parallel biochemical assays. The integration of microwave circuits with microfluidics is beneficial from the following two aspects: microwave sensors can be potentially used for microfluidics sensing because they are lowcost, non-invasive and high-speed. With microfluidics, quantitative dielectric studies of biological fluids can be performed using only nanoliter fluid samples in tightly controlled environments. Research on microfluidics sensors realized with a commercial packaging technology and microwave-microfluidics metrology have been conducted in this PhD. The research findings in this PhD will serve future promising applications that {{make use of the}} integration of microwave circuits and microfluidics. Compact millimeter wave low temperature co-fired ceramic resonator sensors at 60 GHz and 90 GHz have been investigated for microfluidics sensing applications. The resonator sensors have been realized with substrate integrated cavity resonators, and cavity perturbation was accomplished via sensing openings on the cavity metal planes. The sensors were characterized using in-house test structures and standard fluids. The 90 GHz matched resonator sensor showed sharp resonances whose resonance frequencies were linear with fluid permittivity, which gives this sensor the potential to be used in sensitive and quantitative sensing applications. The metrology of dielectric fluids characterization using microwavemicrofluidics has been thoroughly investigated. The study includes every aspect of physical quantity extraction from S-parameters, i. e., vector-network-analyzer calibration, complex permittivity extraction methods, and uncertainty analysis. Existing shunt resistor calibration algorithms on impedance standard substrate, i. e., load-reflect-match and load-reflect-reflect-match calibrations, have been critically reviewed. New general calibration algorithms using series-resistors have been proposed and validated through low-loss and lossy substrates. For accurate and straightforward dielectric fluids characterization, novel extraction algorithms have been proposed. Uncertainty analysis, tracing back to fundamental error sources like conductor thickness variability and probe-placement errors, were performed to quantify the quality of measurement. Uncertainty propagation has also been modelled analytically to explain the dispersion characteristics of the uncertainties of different permittivity extraction algorithms. The outcome of this metrology research are fundamental techniques, available for use by future biophysicists studying the dielectric relaxations of biological fluids using microwave-microfluidics.

Commercial lasers used at these wavelengths are generally GaAs and InP based quantum well lasers which suffer from undesirable characteristics including higher threshold, limited small-signal modulation bandwidth and most notably poor temperature stability. Due to their unique optoelectronic properties, lasers incorporating quantum dots can have better temperature stability, chirp-free high speed operation, and higher modulation bandwidth {{compared with those}} incorporating equivalent quantum wells which make them a favorable candidate for practical applications. A novel InAs/GaAs quantum dot rolled-up microtube laser formed by an epitaxial strain-driven mechanism has been investigated. Simplified analytical expressions have been derived for the scattering (radiation) loss at the microtube notches, the bending loss, and the substrate loss and their values have been calculated {{as a function of}} tube diameter. The threshold condition for a microtube laser has been derived from which it is found that the threshold excitation (power) is inversely proportional to the microtube diameter. A rolled-up microtube directional coupler made of twin tubes has demonstrated. The coupling characteristics have been measured in isopropyl alcohol as the surrounding media to demonstrate the potential of the device as a <b>fluid</b> <b>sensor.</b> A rolled-up microtube consisting of a microtube laser, a microtube detector and a waveguide connecting them has also been demonstrated.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a monolithic bandpass filter implemented in a 0. 8 um, double-poly CMOS process. The 6 th order, 1 dB passband ripple Chebyshev bandpass filter has a 4 kHz passband centered around fc = 26 kHz, while frequencies lower than fc/ 2 are suppressed {{by more than}} 60 dB. The proposed parasitic insensitive filter architecture is suitable {{for the implementation of}} bandpass filters over a very large range of frequencies. The bandpass filter is part of a circuit developed for conditioning the signal of a CMOS-compatible <b>fluid</b> density <b>sensor...</b>|$|R
