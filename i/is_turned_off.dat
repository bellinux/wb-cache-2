5|$|Reflector sights as {{aircraft}} gun-sights {{have many}} advantages. The pilot/gunner need not position their head to align the sight line precisely {{as they did}} in two-point mechanical sights, head position is only limited to that determined by the optics in the collimator, mostly by the diameter of the collimator lens. The sight does not interfere with the overall view, particularly when the collimator light <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting.|$|E
5|$|Craig {{decides to}} take Jack {{to a doctor}} so that a vaccine can be created. During the meeting, Rudy Stagg, a man {{infected}} with POS who had been killing dogs in order to contain the outbreak, stumbles into their room. Rudy ignores pleas to spare Jack and shoots at her, but Logan dives {{in front of the}} dog and is shot instead. Logan suffers a collapsed lung and falls into a coma. He awakens weeks later and learns that Jack is on life support. He says a final goodbye to Jack before her life support <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> Jack's immunity to POS leads {{to the creation of a}} vaccine and cure, and Logan is finally able to reconcile with Robert, Craig, and Devon Wallacea childhood enemy whose dog died due to POS. The novel's epilogue, written as a newspaper article, reveals Logan and his family hold a private ceremony to honor Jack.|$|E
5|$|During {{a camping}} trip, O'Malley learns that Torres has slept with chief of plastic surgery Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), and also discovers that Burke is {{experiencing}} tremors in his hand. When O'Malley's father is diagnosed with esophageal cancer and a leaking aortic valve, {{he refuses to}} allow Burke to operate on him, instead contacting Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), Burke's medical school rival. His relationship with Torres is strained when he confronts her about sleeping with Sloan, but he allows her to support him through his father's deteriorating health. Complications from his father's surgery leave him in multi-system organ failure, and his life support <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> In an attempt to overcome his grief, O'Malley elopes with Callie to Las Vegas. He later begins to feel that he was mistaken to marry her, and sleeps with Stevens while intoxicated. Stevens confesses that she {{is in love with}} him, so O'Malley considers transferring to a different hospital so he can be faithful to his wife. However, he is ineligible to transfer after failing the intern exams. O'Malley decides to repeat his intern year, and confesses to Torres that he slept with Stevens, leading the two to separate. O'Malley and Stevens embark on a short-lived relationship, only to discover there is no real chemistry between them.|$|E

5|$|Mad Maxs {{landscape}} {{consists of}} canyons, caves, deserts, and abandoned wastelands. The game's world {{is divided into}} several regions, with each having its own backstory and landscape. Unique landmarks and ruins can be discovered in each region. Side activities such as races, time trials, invading enemy fortresses, and eliminating enemy convoys {{can be found in}} each region. A region's threat level is lowered by completing these activities, facilitating its navigation. Each region has a boss, who can be found and defeated in their base. Some of the game's strongholds are friendly, and eliminating hostile strongholds gives Max additional quests and rewards. These strongholds can be upgraded, offering Max different benefits such as helping Max to collect scraps when the game <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> or restoring Max's health and shotgun ammo upon visits. Max can ascend in a hot-air balloon (permanently attached to the ground) to look for new objectives and locations. After seeing the objectives through binoculars, they are highlighted on the map. Max can be guided by Chumbucket in strategically completing his objectives. Max is accompanied by a dog companion called Dinki-Di, who can help players detect land mines. Max has limited climbing abilities, and objects that he can climb are highlighted in yellow.|$|E
5|$|The Odyssey {{consists}} of a black, white, and brown oblong box connected by wires to two rectangular controllers. The primary console box connects to the television set through an included switchbox, which allows the player to switch the television input between the Odyssey and the regular television input cable, and presents itself like a television channel. The controllers, which are designed {{to sit on a}} flat surface, contain one button marked Reset {{on the top of the}} controller and three knobs: one on the right side of the controller, and two on the left with one extending from the other. The reset button does not reset the game, but instead is used by different games to reset individual elements, such as making a player's dot visible after it <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> during a game. The system can be powered by six C batteries, which were included. An optional AC power supply was sold separately. The Odyssey lacks sound capability and can only display monochrome white shapes on a blank black screen.|$|E
25|$|Microwaves {{generated}} in microwave ovens {{cease to exist}} once the electrical power <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> They do not remain in the food when the power <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> any more than light from an electric lamp remains in the walls and furnishings of a room when the lamp <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> They do not make the food or the oven radioactive. Compared to conventional cooking, the nutritional content of some foods may be altered differently, but generally {{in a positive way}} by preserving more micronutrients - see above. There is no indication of detrimental health issues associated with microwaved food.|$|E

25|$|The pack is {{designed}} to prevent catastrophic cell failures from propagating to adjacent cells (thermal runaway), even when the cooling system is off. Coolant is pumped continuously through the ESS both when the car is running and when the car <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> if the pack retains more than a 90% charge. The coolant pump draws 146 watts. The cooling and battery management system keeps the temperatures and voltages within specific limits.|$|E
25|$|To {{accelerate}} the electrons from the cathode {{to the screen}} with sufficient velocity, a very high voltage (EHT or Extra High Tension) is required, from a few thousand volts for a small oscilloscope CRT to tens of kV for a larger screen color TV. This is many times greater than household power supply voltage. Even after the power supply <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> some associated capacitors and the CRT itself may retain a charge for some time.|$|E

25|$|In the {{developing}} pancreas, transcription factor ngn3’marks {{the populations of}} cells that are in transit from undifferentiated epithelial progenitor cells to mature endocrine cells (precursors of pancreatic endocrine cells), and thus that do not express hormones yet, which suggests that this gene <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> in differentiated hormone-positive. ngn3’’ is both necessary and sufficient to drive the formation of islet cells during pancreatic development, {{in a manner similar}} to the specification of neural fate in neuroectoderm.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the basic}} {{threshold}} model, the transistor <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> {{and there is no}} conduction between drain and source. A more accurate model considers the effect of thermal energy on the Fermi–Dirac distribution of electron energies which allow some of the more energetic electrons at the source to enter the channel and flow to the drain. This results in a subthreshold current that is an exponential function of gate–source voltage. While the current between drain and source should ideally be zero when the transistor is being used as a turned-off switch, there is a weak-inversion current, sometimes called subthreshold leakage.|$|E

25|$|Irradiated food {{does not}} become radioactive, just as an object exposed to light does not start {{producing}} light. Radioactivity {{is the ability of}} a substance to emit high energy particles. When particles hit the target materials they may free other highly energetic particles. This ends shortly {{after the end of the}} exposure, much like objects stop reflecting light when the source <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> and warm objects emit heat until they cool down but do not continue to produce their own heat. To modify a material so that it keeps emitting radiation (induce radiation) the atomic cores (nucleus) of the atoms in the target material must be modified.|$|E
25|$|Consider a solid {{consisting}} of a single molecular species and subjected to melting. Ultimately it is rendered to an isotropic state classically referred to as liquid. Mesophases occur before then when an intermediate state of order is still maintained as in the nematic, smectic, and columnar phases of liquid crystals. Mesophases thus exhibit anisotropy. For instance, LCD devices work on the optical switch principle that obscures light or lets it pass. This switch <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> and on by an electric field applied to the mesogen with director. The response of the director to the field is expressed with viscosity parameters, as in the Ericksen-Leslie theory in continuum mechanics developed by Jerald Ericksen and Frank Matthews Leslie.|$|E
25|$|The Multi-information display, {{located in}} the center of the tachometer, can be toggled through nine {{different}} screens of vehicle information including instantaneous fuel economy, hybrid system schematic, trip computer, and ECO Guide. The ECO Guide display includes a real-time graphic that provides a target zone for acceleration and deceleration in order to achieve maximum fuel economy. When the ignition switch <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> a summary screen displays a scoring function that encourages drivers to take an interest in developing fuel-efficient driving habits over the long term. In this manner, drivers can earn additional ‘leaves’ on a plant stem when practicing fuel saving strategies. Long-term fuel efficient driving habits ultimately earn the driver a ‘trophy’ graphic.|$|E
