5|$|O you, Son, who, {{concealed}} in your mother's womb, you gather together peoples by your Father's act – for I perchance {{am able to}} compose a holy narrative because you are seen to be God, because, glorious one, the glittering stars show (you) to the world; and I ask, after the close of my life, that you grant {{to me from the}} throne of <b>heaven</b> <b>to</b> take a tiny gift because of the honour (I have) attained.|$|E
5|$|Shamanism was the {{dominant}} {{religion of the}} Jurchen people of northeast Asia and of their descendants, the Manchu people. As early as the Jin dynasty (1111–1234), the Jurchens conducted shamanic ceremonies at shrines called tangse. There were two kinds of shamans: those who entered in a trance and let themselves be possessed by the spirits, and those who conducted regular sacrifices to <b>heaven,</b> <b>to</b> a clan's ancestors, or to the clan's protective spirits.|$|E
5|$|While social {{mobility}} was not unknown in Byzantium {{the order of}} society was thought of as more enduring, with the average man regarding the court of <b>Heaven</b> <b>to</b> be the archetype of the imperial court in Constantinople. This society included various classes of people that were neither exclusive nor immutable. The most characteristic were the poor, the peasants, the soldiers, the teachers, entrepreneurs, and clergy.|$|E

5|$|In the Harivansh Puraan, the Parijata, baobab tree, {{is called}} a Kalpavriksha, or wish bearing tree, which apart {{from the village of}} Kintoor, near Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh, is only found in heaven. The tree has mythological link with prince Arjuna of the Pandava clan who is said to have brought it from heaven. His mother Kunti after whom the village Kintoor is named used to offer flowers from this tree to worship Lord Shiva. It is also said that Lord Krishna brought this tree from <b>heaven</b> <b>to</b> please his wife Satyabhama.|$|E

5|$|The Negative Declaration for the {{expansion}} of US 113 from {{the north end of the}} Frederica bypass to US 113 Alternate at Little Heaven was issued in 1975, and construction began that same year. The FredericaLittle Heaven divided highway was completed in 1977. Design work for the divided highway from Little <b>Heaven</b> <b>to</b> Dover Air Force Base began as early as 1964, and considerable planning and design work was done before that work came to a halt in the 1970s. In addition to the environmental effects of the highway crossing a large marsh, which required DelDOT to produce a draft environmental impact statement, DelDOT needed to coordinate with the U.S. Coast Guard to construct a new bridge across the St. Jones River. US 113 was finally expanded to a divided highway, including a four-lane bridge across the St. Jones River, by 1985. The final stretch of two-lane US 113 in Delaware was eliminated when the second carriageway was added to the highway from Bedford Street in Georgetown to north of Lincoln in 1995 and 1996. This expansion, in particular a section near Ellendale, was included in a Federal Highway Administration pavement study.|$|E

5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying <b>heaven</b> <b>to</b> grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

25|$|The {{first three}} {{chapters}} of the tractate (Perek I-III) address {{the subject of the}} recitation of Shema, a biblical command that constitutes the acceptance of the yoke of <b>Heaven,</b> <b>to</b> be performed twice per day.

25|$|In Georges Dumézil's view, Jovian {{theology}} (and that of {{the equivalent}} gods in other Indo-European religions) is an evolution from a naturalistic, supreme, celestial god identified with <b>heaven</b> <b>to</b> a sovereign god, a wielder of lightning bolts, master and protector of the community (in other words, of a change from a naturalistic approach {{to the world of}} the divine to a socio-political approach).|$|E
25|$|Among {{the minor}} Midrashim, esoteric {{attributes}} of Enoch are expanded upon. In the Sefer Hekalot, Rabbi Ishmael {{is described as}} having visited the 7th Heaven, where he met Enoch, who claims that earth had, in his time, been corrupted by the demons Shammazai, and Azazel, and so Enoch was taken to <b>Heaven</b> <b>to</b> prove that God was not cruel. Similar traditions are recorded in Sirach. Later elaborations of this interpretation treated Enoch as having been a pious ascetic, who, called to mix with others, preached repentance, and gathered (despite {{the small number of}} people on Earth) a vast collection of disciples, {{to the extent that he}} was proclaimed king. Under his wisdom, peace is said to have reigned on earth, to the extent that he is summoned to <b>Heaven</b> <b>to</b> rule over the sons of God. In a parallel with Elijah, in sight of a vast crowd begging him to stay, he ascends to Heaven on a horse.|$|E
