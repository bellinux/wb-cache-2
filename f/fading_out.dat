5|$|The video {{begins with}} Wade singing and playing his guitar {{in a hotel}} room. While singing, Wade is seen packing his clothes into a suit case in {{separate}} camera shots. He then leaves the hotel room and it shows a time-lapse scene of a car going down a highway. Then, the video cuts to a restaurant, where Wade is seen lying on a restaurant booth and singing the lyrics of the song. After this, Wade is seen {{with the rest of}} Lifehouse in a concert setting in a restaurant. It then splits to shots of Wade singing the lyrics of the song to the camera. Toward the end of the video, it switches to Lifehouse playing the song in front of a crowd while showing shots of Wade in a car going down a highway. It ends with the scene of Lifehouse in a restaurant and then switches to a camera shot of all of the band members with the video <b>fading</b> <b>out</b> on Wade.|$|E
5|$|The UCLA Bruins {{became an}} Oregon rival {{in track and}} field as the two {{powerhouse}} programs battled each other in a series of dual meets. Oregon's program was ranked in the top 3 nationally in dual meets by Track & Field News thirteen times between 1970 and 1996 and was ranked No. 1 three times. The UCLA squad achieved a No. 1 ranking from the same publication eleven times within the same time frame. In 1966, the two programs met head to head for the first time. The Bruins displayed their dominance at the dual meet and won nine straight against the Ducks. Oregon head coach Bill Bowerman in 1971 called the Bruins team the best dual meet team in the country. It wasn't until 1978 that Oregon earned its first victory in the series, which ended UCLA's 34 dual meet winning streak. Oregon won the next three meets and the series ended in 1985 with a UCLA win. The dual meet event was <b>fading</b> <b>out</b> of favor in collegiate track and field and the Oregon-UCLA dual meet was discontinued with UCLA holding the advantage over the Ducks 10–4. In 1994, the Pepsi Team Invitational which included Oregon, UCLA and Washington was scored as a dual meet, which UCLA won. In 2008, the dual meet series between the two schools restarted and Oregon won the first three meets. Although the location of the meet had alternated between Eugene and Los Angeles between 1966 and 1976, subsequent meets have been held at Hayward Field in Oregon until 2011 where the two teams battled to a tie at UCLA. The dual meet was discontinued in 2012 due to scheduling difficulties in an Olympic year.|$|E
25|$|Harvard was in {{the middle}} of this crisis. After three undistinguished {{short-term}} clerical presidencies in a ten-year period, the college was slowly <b>fading</b> <b>out.</b> Boston's business leaders, many of them Harvard alumni, were pressing for change - though with no clear idea of the kinds of changes they wanted.|$|E

25|$|There {{are about}} 140 tribes and clans in Libya. Family life is {{important}} for Libyan families, the majority of which live in apartment blocks and other independent housing units, with precise modes of housing depending on their income and wealth. Although the Libyan Arabs traditionally lived nomadic lifestyles in tents, they have now settled in various towns and cities. Because of this, their old ways of life are gradually <b>fading</b> <b>out.</b> An unknown small number of Libyans {{still live in the}} desert as their families have done for centuries. Most of the population has occupations in industry and services, and a small percentage is in agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Radu Paisie's {{election}} to the throne {{was made possible by}} a collapse of public order and the <b>fading</b> <b>out</b> of the ruling dynasty, the House of Basarab. Wallachia's elective custom had always allowed sons born outside wedlock to contest the throne, creating the background for massacres among pretenders; in the 1500s, this strife was doubled by civil wars between factions of the boyar nobility. These backed individual pretenders in exchange for domination of the country's affairs. The conflicts were tolerated by the Ottoman Empire, which exercised suzerainty over Wallachia and neighboring Moldavia (the Danubian Principalities). The fall of Hungary in 1526 left both countries entirely controlled by the Sublime Porte.|$|E

5000|$|As a {{reference}} to the film and its title, the song has no distinctive beginning, nor an end. While many songs <b>fade</b> <b>out,</b> [...] "The NeverEnding Story" [...] not only <b>fades</b> <b>out,</b> but also <b>fades</b> in, thus making it [...] "never ending".|$|R

25|$|An {{overview}} of the eruption and seismic activity so far was published on IMO's website on 3 December. Insubstantial changes in the eruption occurred in December 2014. The lava field had increased to 82.8km2. The lava ran in a closed channel to the east 15km from the Baugur crater. M5+ quakes continued in the caldera; on December 19, vertical displacement at the caldera was measured at 56 metres. The eruption continued to emit intense sulphurous gasses which affected air quality throughout Iceland, depending on the weather conditions. On 25 December, a new earthquake sequence was recorded at the Geysir geothermal field 140 kilometres west of Bárðarbunga; the activity lasted for two days before <b>fading</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{is nothing}} solid {{left in the}} Players' Protective Association. There has been no {{activity}} {{on the part of}} the present officials, and there will be none. The organization has been allowed to die because the members have seen nothing in it to interest them. Some are not pleased with the officers; others object to the paying of dues, while others still believe that they can do better by themselves than by acting in concert with all the other players; and so the Players' Protective Association gradually is being allowed to die out. One hears but little of it now, and in a year from now will hear less. It would have been a good thing for the players if they had been true to its principles and the officials had been active in carrying out all its aims and laws. However, there was failure on all sides, and the result is that the organization gradually is <b>fading</b> <b>out</b> of existence.|$|E
25|$|Following a {{referendum}} held in Singapore, the Federation of Malaysia, which comprised Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo, was proclaimed in September 1963. The Legislative Assembly of Singapore held an election {{on the same}} month; the SPA had formed the Singapore Alliance Party together with some {{other members of the}} Opposition back in 1961, under the support of the ruling Alliance Party in Malaysia, with the attempts of challenging the PAP once again. However, Lim did not contest in the election, while the Alliance Party did not win any seat; Lim resigned his chairmanship from the SPA, <b>fading</b> <b>out</b> of Singaporean politics. In January 1964, the then-Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman appointed Lim as Malaysian High Commissioner in Australia. When Singapore gained independence from Malaysia in August 1965, he acquired Malaysian citizenship and was issued Malaysian passport. Remained in office as the High Commissioner, he described himself as a 'child of estranged parents', hoping for the reunification of the two states.|$|E
50|$|Both the {{original}} and radio edit of the song was often played over the airwaves during the late 1970s. The difference is the song <b>fades</b> <b>out</b> before the second saxophone solo and ending guitar melody that would itself eventually <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> with primary instruments being removed.|$|R
5000|$|Of note, 1960s record {{releases}} {{of the second}} version, as well as subsequent hits packages of the song, feature a <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> ending. The cold ending version (heard in one episode of the television series) was first released on Arista's [...] "Then And Now, The Best Of The Monkees" [...] in 1986. Subsequent hits packages and reissues of the single on their Flashback label also feature the longer version. Early examples of the Flashback single release have the <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> ending. The original Colgems single has the <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> ending.|$|R

25|$|When {{the video}} {{switches}} {{to the real}} Aguilera, she is seen descending {{from the top of}} a circus tent on a rope, onto the back of an elephant, in Pointe shoes and a structured jeweled outfit, with her father watching adoringly in the audience. She later attempts to greet him but is pulled away by fans and photographers. The content of the telegram is then revealed to be a message of her father's death, and as Aguilera realizes that she was too wrapped up in her stardom to deal with what matters, she races through the circus in a belated attempt to find her father. Overwhelmed, Aguilera collapses on the ground and then sees a shadow figure of a man {{standing in front of the}} circus tent. Hoping the shadow figure to be her father, Aguilera holds out her hand with the elephant necklace on it in an attempt of reconciliation. She break down crying when she realizes the silhouette has disappeared and that her father is truly gone. The video ends with a shot of Aguilera sitting on a circus box, singing and crying, before <b>fading</b> <b>out</b> to Aguilera's grief-stricken form on the ground outside the circus tent. The camera then zooms out and Aguilera is seen on the ground.|$|E
25|$|After {{the three}} beats of silence that open the score, a tubular bell is struck three times very quietly (pianissimo), with 12 beats between the strikes and gap of 18 beats {{between the groups}} of three. This bell tells {{of the death of}} Britten—it is the funeral bell. It {{continues}} to be struck in groups of three widely spaced intervals for most of the piece, <b>fading</b> <b>out</b> for a time in the last 21 bars, only to reappear at the last. After the bell has struck there is a brief pause for three beats of silence, and then the first violins begin setting the pattern which the rest of the ensemble will follow at slower speeds. Half of the first violins begin playing the descending A minor scale, playing first one note from the very top of their range, then returning to the beginning and playing two notes, and then three and four and so on. The other half of the violins play notes from an A minor chord. These notes start a fourth lower and drop in pitch only when it is overrun by the first. This creates a swirling effect of increasing tension which is relieved by dropping the note. They begin playing very quietly (pianississimo) but gradually over the piece build up until they are playing very loudly (fortississimo).|$|E
500|$|The song's {{breakdown}} {{coined the}} phrase [...] "shake {{it like a}} Polaroid picture", a reference to an erroneous technique used by some photographers to expedite instant film. Early versions of the film needed to be dried, and shaking the picture helped it to dry faster. The breakdown also namechecks singer Beyoncé and actress Lucy Liu. The song closes by repeating the chorus and gradually <b>fading</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Note: The {{ending of}} the album version of [...] "Diamond Sun" [...] is a parody of [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] by The Beatles. Just as the song <b>fades</b> <b>out,</b> the song <b>fades</b> in with only the {{percussion}} beat and <b>fades</b> <b>out</b> again with Alan Frew's voice saying [...] "I buried Paul".|$|R
5000|$|Another aspect in {{the film}} are the <b>fade</b> <b>outs,</b> which are {{traditionally}} used in movies to represent time passing or to conclude a certain scene, instead bring the viewers {{back to the point}} in time which the <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> began. The occasional <b>fade</b> <b>outs</b> and <b>fade</b> ins to Julie's character are used to represent an extremely subjective point of view. According to Kieślowski: [...] "at a certain moment, time really does pass for Julie while at the same time, it stands still. Not only does her music come back to haunt her at a certain point, but time stands still for a moment." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{ears are}} small, sparsely covered in hair, and {{hidden in the}} fur. [...] Similar to the slender lorises, the fur around and {{directly}} above the eyes is dark. [...] Unlike the slender lorises, however, the white stripe that separates the eye rings broadens both {{on the tip of}} the nose and on the forehead while also <b>fading</b> <b>out</b> on the forehead. [...] Like other strepsirrhine primates, the nose and lip are covered by a moist skin called the rhinarium ("wet nose"), which is a sense organ.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} {{the group in}} Times Square in New York City with fast moving cars appearing around multi-coloured lights, appearing in various places around the city, either alone, with one other member, or as a quintet. The video is intercut with scenes of lovers experiencing moments of togetherness and closes with a deer wandering the streets. Such a scene, according to the group's first official book Girl Power!, gave them a running gag all throughout the shoot—"Whenever anyone made a mistake it was, 'Oh, deer'." [...] Sometimes, the closing scene would not be shown on television, due to the song <b>fading</b> <b>out</b> to an instrumental, which lasts for 40 seconds.|$|E
500|$|... "It's All Too Much" [...] was remixed for {{inclusion}} on the Yellow Submarine album on 16 October 1968. The vocals and handclaps were processed using automatic double tracking, so allowing these parts to be split across the stereo image. For this version, {{the song was}} edited down from the original eight minutes to a running time of 6:28, making it the longest officially released Beatles track written by Harrison. The edit was achieved by cutting a 35-second portion from around the three-minute mark, thereby removing the third chorus and the fourth verse (the last of which, beginning with the line [...] "Time for {{me to look at}} you and you to look at me", had appeared in the film), and by <b>fading</b> <b>out</b> before the final minute of the coda.|$|E

500|$|As Madonna {{finishes}} {{singing the}} intermediate lines, [...] "Close your eyes, sleepy-head, It {{is time for}} your bed, Never forget what I said, Hang on...", a trumpet starts playing alongside the main rhythm. The breakdown has the feel of Spanish music, with the glissando evoking the string arrangements. This {{is followed by the}} bridge and the chorus being repeated twice. [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] ends with all instrumentation and vocals <b>fading</b> <b>out,</b> except the orchestra, which is equalized to make it sound very thin and trebly, as if coming out from a distorted radio. The lyrics encourage the little girl Jessie to use her imagination. It summons up a psychedelic landscape, where pink elephants roam with dancing moons and mermaids. It references fairy-tale characters and creates an image of children playing with each other.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hold Me Now" [...] was {{directed}} by Rupert James, produced by Tim Bevan, and edited by Brian Grant and Nick Morris. [...] The video features the Thompson Twins in a set with a blue background. [...] Each member is standing on a platform, singing or playing a different instrument, a guitar or a piano for Bailey, a Marimba or another percussion instrument for Currie, and a bass guitar or congas for Leeway. [...] The video is heavily edited, with frames sliding from the sides, doubling or tripling, split-screen edits, and close-ups of the band while singing or dancing. [...] At the end the background changes from blue to red, and the three members are featured together singing and clapping while the song is <b>fading</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
500|$|In April 1997, {{the serial}} was {{released}} on VHS by BMG Video in two separate sets, 1964 – 1974 and 1979 – 1995. In 2002, BMG released the complete series on DVD, which along with the original episodes contained several extra features, including a retrospective discussion of the series by Wearing, Pattinson, Flannery, James and Cellan Jones, and specially shot interviews with Eccleston and McKee. Simply Media brought out a second DVD release of the serial in September 2010, although on this occasion there were no extra features. This edition contained an edit not present on the 2002 BMG release; most of the song [...] "Don't Look Back In Anger" [...] by Oasis is removed {{at the end of}} the final episode, <b>fading</b> <b>out</b> early and the credits instead running in silence.|$|E
