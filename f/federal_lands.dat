5|$|In 1864 the State of New Jersey named Rutgers College {{as their}} sole land grant college.

5|$|Although the Advisory Board {{recommendations}} {{focused on}} wildlife and habitat management, they also touched upon the recreation of primitive, uncontrolled conditions. Revisiting fire ecology {{and the importance}} of fire, which had long been suppressed in national parks and other <b>federal</b> <b>lands,</b> the report recommended the use of prescribed fire as a cheap and natural tool for shaping the park environment.|$|E
5|$|The area {{contains}} multiple {{species of}} wildlife, {{both in the}} <b>federal</b> <b>lands</b> {{at the southern end}} of the peninsula (managed in part as an ecological reserve) and in the developed suburban areas. Mammals include raccoons, skunks, possums, bats, rabbits, California ground squirrels, gray foxes, and occasional coyotes. More than 300 species of birds have been observed in Point Loma, which lies on the Pacific Flyway migration route.|$|E

5|$|The global oil-shale {{industry}} {{began to}} revive {{at the beginning}} of the 21st century. In 2003, an oil-shale development program restarted in the United States.

5|$|In 1989, annual {{timber harvest}} revenue on federal forest land {{nationwide}} peaked at $1.5 billion. Following that year, {{the impact of}} overharvesting and increased environmental concerns began to negatively impact timber sales on the O lands. In 1994, the federal Northwest Forest Plan was implemented. Designed to guide forest management of <b>federal</b> <b>lands</b> while protecting old-growth forest habitat for endangered species such as the Northern spotted owl, the plan restricted the land available for timber harvest. By 1998, revenue on federal forest lands fell {{to a third of}} the peak 1989 revenue, with areas in the Northwest particularly hard-hit.|$|E
5|$|In New Jersey, older Department of Defense and Department of Interior {{properties}} such as Fort Dix {{and parts}} of Sandy Hook are federal enclaves, but most other federal properties are not enclaves. Because New Jersey generally did not reserve any right to regulate federal enclaves, state liquor licensing rules and alcohol taxes cannot be enforced. There is no universal policy regarding the sale of alcoholic beverages on <b>federal</b> <b>lands,</b> but almost all military bases, and some national parks allow for alcohol concessions, both for on-premises or off-premises consumption.|$|E

5|$|Several {{laws and}} {{specific}} regulations govern {{the management of}} free-roaming horses and burros on <b>federal</b> <b>lands,</b> both those managed by the BLM and those managed by the USFS. These include the Wild Horse Protection Act of 1959, the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971, as amended by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978. The United States Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) addresses management of wild free-roaming horses and burros at 36 CFR 222 Subpart B.|$|E
5|$|The {{applicability}} {{of state and}} municipal alcohol laws on <b>federal</b> <b>lands</b> is a complex and partially unresolved legal issue that depends on whether the federal property is considered a federal enclave, what rights the state reserved when it granted the property to the federal government, and whether the law is criminal or civil. If the federal property is not an enclave, the federal government either has concurrent jurisdiction (shared authority with the state) or proprietary jurisdiction (only the rights of a landowner), and the state can enforce alcohol laws.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the state, federal {{agencies}} which allow alcohol sales {{do not have}} a system of liquor licenses or alcoholic beverage control boards, but instead simply award contracts to business per federal procurement laws. New Jersey does not consider municipal ordinances to be criminal offenses, and so open container laws cannot be enforced in federal enclaves under the Assimilative Crimes Act. Public consumption of alcohol is allowed on <b>federal</b> <b>lands,</b> except when in an automobile, or when the park superintendent has prohibited open containers in an area. For example, it is legal to consume alcoholic beverages on the beach at Sandy Hook.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 2008, {{advocacy}} groups in Maryland and New York, and their federal representatives, pushed for legislation to establish two national historical parks honoring Harriet Tubman: one to include her {{place of birth}} on Maryland's eastern shore, and sites along {{the route of the}} Underground Railroad in Caroline, Dorchester, and Talbot Counties in Maryland; and a second to include her home in Auburn, NY. For the next six years, bills to do so were introduced, but were never advanced or enacted. Meantime, in 2013, President Barack Obama used his executive authority to create the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument, consisting of <b>federal</b> <b>lands</b> on Maryland's Eastern Shore at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{is one of}} the ten most visited {{national}} parks in the U.S., with an annual average of 2.75million visitors in the period from 2007 to 2016, with 3.27 million visiting in 2016. The National Park Service is a federal agency of the United States Department of the Interior and manages both Grand Teton National Park and the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. Grand Teton National Park has an average of 100 permanent and 180 seasonal employees. The park also manages 27 concession contracts that provide services such as lodging, restaurants, mountaineering guides, dude ranching, fishing and a boat shuttle on Jenny Lake. The National Park Service works closely with other federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, and also, in consequence of Jackson Hole Airport's presence in the park, the Federal Aviation Administration. Initial construction of the airstrip north of the town of Jackson was completed in the 1930s. When Jackson Hole National Monument was designated, the airport was inside it. After the monument and park were combined, the Jackson Hole Airport became the only commercial airport within a U.S. National Park. Jackson Hole Airport has some of the strictest noise abatement regulations of any airport in the U.S. The airport has night flight curfews and overflight restrictions, with pilots being expected to approach and depart the airport along the east, south or southwest flight corridors. As of 2010, 110 privately owned property inholdings, many belonging to the state of Wyoming, are located within Grand Teton National Park. Efforts to purchase or trade these inholdings for other <b>federal</b> <b>lands</b> are ongoing and through partnerships with other entities, 10million dollars is hoped to be raised to acquire private inholdings by 2016. Some monies are allocated from congress via the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but Grand Teton National Park may not get all the money needed from the fund as it is divided up between four different federal agencies. Efforts to exchange federal land from other areas for inholdings were still in the negotiation phase in 2012.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, the General Mining Law of 1872 gave {{rights to}} explore and mine on public domain land; the {{original}} law did not require post-mining reclamation (Woody et al. 2011).

25|$|If an {{aircraft}} wreck is over fifty years old, which includes all aviation wreck sites from WWII, and crashed {{on what is}} currently <b>federal</b> <b>lands,</b> the sites are automatically protected under National Park Service Law 36CFR2.1 against disturbance of any kind without a permit. Sites on federal land are further protected under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 throughout a determination process. The act stipulates that all historic sites must undergo a Section 106 review to determine eligibility for the National Register of Historical Places prior to being disturbed. <b>Federal</b> <b>lands</b> include, among others, National Parks, National Forests, National Marine Sanctuaries, and land owned by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Aviation sites, for example a vintage hangar on an airport or a wreck site {{on the path of}} a proposed highway, are also immediately subject to Section 106 review {{if they are to be}} disturbed by a project that either requires a federal permit or uses federal funds.
