Trypsin is an enzyme that acts to degrade protein (proteolytic enzyme or proteinase) (Infoplease, 2012). Collagen is a very important component structure of the bone, teeth, and the gingival and periodontal ligament, all of which can be affected when restorations are placed in contact with or near them. Collagen is produced by fibroblast cells (including HGF). It has also been well established that the resin composite co-monomer TEGDMA causes gene mutation in some cases in vitro (Schweikl et al. 2006).|$|E

The assay was developed in a Xenopus laevis cell line that was transduced with a self-inactivating (SIN) lentivirus vector (LV) containing a luciferase gene. The luciferase activation in this cell line was TH-specific: 3, 3 #, 5 -L-triiodothyronine (T 3) > 3, 3 # 5 -L-triiodothyroacetic acid (Triac) > 3, 3 #, 5 -D-triiodothyronine (D-T 3),> L-thyroxine (T 4) > 3, 3 #, 5 #-L-triiodothyronine (rT 3).

We found detectable levels of metabolites monoethyl phthalate (MEP), monobutyl phthalate (MBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and mono-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) in> 75 % of the samples, suggesting widespread exposure in the United States to diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate or diisobutylphthalate, benzylbutyl phthalate, and di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, respectively. We infrequently detected monoisononyl phthalate, mono-cyclohexyl phthalate, and mono-n-octyl phthalate, suggesting that human exposures to di-isononyl phthalate, dioctylphthalate, and <b>dicyclohexyl</b> <b>phthalate,</b> respectively, are lower than those listed above, or the pathways, routes of exposure, or pharmacokinetic factors such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination are different. Non-Hispanic blacks had significantly higher concentrations of MEP than did Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic whites.

40|$|We {{determined}} the binding affinities of some chemicals {{suspected of having}} endocrine-disrupting effects for androgen and/or estrogen receptors (ADR and ERα) by a non-radioisotope (RI) receptor binding assay. Tributyltin had the highest binding affinity for ADR with an IC 50 of 7. 6 × 10 – 6 M, but no affinity for ERα. Bisphenol A and 4 -nonylphenol strongly bound to both ADR (IC 50 values of 7. 9 × 10 – 6 and 1. 3 × 10 – 5 M, respectively) and ERα (IC 50 values of 7. 8 × 10 – 6 and 7. 2 × 10 – 7 M, respectively). Octachlorostyrene had af-finity for both receptors (IC 50 for ADR, 2. 7 × 10 – 5 M; and for ERα, 7. 0 × 10 – 5 M). Although 4 -octylphenol had a low affinity for ADR, it had a high affinity for ERα (IC 50 of 9. 8 × 10 – 6 M). Di-n-butyl phthalate, <b>dicyclohexyl</b> <b>phthalate,</b> and di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate had low affinities for both ADR and ERα.

40|$|<b>Dicyclohexyl</b> <b>{{phthalate}}</b> (DCHP) {{is one of}} the phthalate plasticizers. The {{objective of}} the present study was to investigate the effects of DCHP on fetal Leydig cell distribution and function as well as testis development. Female pregnant Sprague Dawley dams orally received vehicle (corn oil, control) or DCHP (10, 100, and 500 mg/kg/day) from gestational day (GD) 12 to GD 21. At GD 21. 5, testicular testosterone production, fetal Leydig cell number and distribution, testicular gene and protein expression levels were examined. DCHP administration produced a dose-dependent increase of the incidence of multinucleated gonocytes at ≥ 100 mg/kg. DCHP dose-dependently increased abnormal fetal Leydig cell aggregation and decreased fetal Leydig cell size, cytoplasmic size, and nuclear size at ≥ 10 mg/kg. DCHP reduced the expression levels of steroidogenesis-related genes (including Star, Hsd 3 b 1, and Hsd 17 b 3) and testis-descent related gene Insl 3 as well as protein levels of 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (HSD 3 B 1) and insulin-like 3 (INSL 3) at ≥ 10 mg/kg. DCHP significantly inhibited testicular testosterone levels at ≥ 100 mg/kg. The results indicate that in utero exposure to DCHP affects the expression levels of fetal Leydig cell steroidogenic genes and results in the occurrence of multinucleated gonocytes and Leydig cell aggregation...|$|E
40|$|A new CE {{method has}} been {{developed}} for the simultaneous separation {{of a group of}} parent phthalates. Due to the neutral character of these compounds, the addition of several bile salts as surfactants (sodium cholate (SC), sodium deoxycholate (SDC), sodium taurodeoxycholate (STDC), sodium taurocholate (STC)) to the separation buffer was explored showing the high potential of SDC as pseudostationary phase. However, the resolution of all the phthalates was not achieved when employing only this bile salt as additive, being necessary the addition of neutral cyclodextrins (CD) and organic modifiers to the separation media. The optimized cyclodextrin modified micellar electrokinetic chromatography (CD-MEKC) method consisted of the employ of a background electrolyte (BGE) containing 25 mM -CD- 100 mM SDC in a 100 mM borate buffer (pH 8. 5) with a 10 % (v/v) of acetonitrile, employing a voltage of 30 kV and a temperature of 25 ◦C. This separation medium enabled the total resolution of eight compounds and the partial resolution of two of the analytes, di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP) and diethyl hexyl phthalate (DEHP) (Rs ∼ 0. 8), in only 12 min. The analytical characteristics of the developed method were studied showing their suitability for the determination of these compounds in commercial perfumes. In all the analyzed perfumes the most common phthalate was diethyl phthalate (DEP) that appeared in ten of the fifteen analyzed products. Also dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diallyl phthalate (DAP), <b>dicyclohexyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DCP), and di-n-pentyl phthalate (DNPP) were found in some of the analyzed samples...|$|E
40|$|Novel superparamagnetic chitosan-coated C- 18 -functionalized {{magnetite}} nanoparticles (MNPs) {{were successfully}} synthesized and applied {{as an effective}} sorbent for the preconcentration of several typical phthalate ester compounds from environmental water samples. The MNPs were 20 nm in diameter and had a high magnetic saturation value (52 emu g(- 1)), which endowed the sorbent with a large surface area and the convenience of isolation from water samples. Phthalate esters could be extracted by the interior octadecyl groups through hydrophobic interaction. The hydrophilic porous chitosan polymer coating promoted the dispersion of MNPs in water samples, and improved the anti-interference ability of the sorbent without influencing the adsorption of analytes. The main factors affecting the adsorption of phthalate esters, including the pH of the solution, humic acid, sample loading volume, adsorption time, and desorption conditions, were investigated and optimized. Under the conditions selected (pH 11, adsorption time 20 min, elution with 10 mL of acetonitrile, and concentration to 0. 5 mL), concentration factors of 1, 000 were achieved by extracting 500 mL of several environmental water samples with 0. 1 g of MNP sorbent. The method detection limits obtained for di-n-propyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, <b>dicyclohexyl</b> <b>phthalate,</b> and di-n-octyl phthalate were 12. 3, 18. 7, 36. 4, and 15. 6 ng L- 1, respectively.

Two of the functionalized monomers, N-phenyl- 1 -(2 -thienyl) methanimine and phenyl(4 -(6 - thiophen- 3 -yl-hexyloxy) -benzylidine) amine {{were successfully}} synthesized. Characterization by FT-IR, TGA, XRD, VSM and BET confirmed the coating has taken place. Further characterization of MNP coated poly(phenyl-(4 -(6 -thiophen- 3 - yl-hexyloxy) -benzylidine) amine) (P 3 TArH) was conducted using TEM and FESEM. Among those nanocomposites, MNP coated P 3 TArH has shown higher determination capabilities of phthalates. The adsorption behaviour of di(2 - ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) onto the MNP coated P 3 TArH showed fast kinetics, occurred heterogenously on the adsorption sites and exothermic. The activation energy determined found was - 40. 6 kJ mol− 1 K− 1, indicated the process is physisorption. The successful synthesised magnetic nanoparticles were further optimized for magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) of environmental samples.

Vinyl products contained > 10 % bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and could be an important source of DEHP in homes. In other products, the highest concentrations and numbers of detects were in the fragranced products (e. g., perfume, air fresheners, and dryer sheets) and in sunscreens. Some products that did not contain the well-known endocrine-disrupting phthalates contained other less-studied phthalates (<b>dicyclohexyl</b> <b>phthalate,</b> diisononyl phthalate, and di-n-propyl phthalate; also endocrine-disrupting compounds), suggesting a substitution. Many detected chemicals were not listed on product labels. |Common products contain complex mixtures of EDCs and asthma-related compounds. Toxicological studies of these mixtures are needed to understand their biological activity. Regarding epidemiology, our findings raise concern about potential confounding from co-occurring chemicals and misclassification due to variability in product composition.

40|$|We have {{prepared}} core/shell structured carbon-encapsulated magnetic nanoparticles (CMNPs) {{with a simple}} method by using inorganic iron salt and glucose solution as precursor substance. The synthetic procedure {{does not require the}} use of organic solvents. We have utilized X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman analysis to examine the surface properties of CMNPs prepared at different temperature. The specific surface areas, magnetization and contents of graphitized carbon on carbon shell of CMNPs increase with heat treatment temperature. The obtained CMNPs are used to adsorb or preconcentrate bisphenol A (BPA), 4 -n-nonylphenol (4 -NP), 4 -tert-octylphenol (4 -OP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dipropyl phthalate (DPP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP) <b>dicyclohexyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DCHP), dioctyl phthalate (DOP), sulfonamide, tetracyclines, and quinolones antibiotics organic compounds from water samples. The adsorption of analytes is mainly based on pi-pi stacking interaction, hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonds between analytes and graphitic carbon. As a result, the adsorption or extraction behaviors of CMNPs to analytes are controlled by the content of oxygen-containing species and graphitized carbon on carbon shell of CMNPs. CMNPs prepared at 200 degrees C have ample oxygen-containing species (80 %) on surface and favor the adsorption and extraction of quinolones antibiotics. CMNPs heated at 300 - 500 degrees C with the graphitization efficiency of carbon shell lower than 50 % exhibit great preconcentration performance to BPA, 4 -NP, 4 -OP, DBP, DCHP, DOP, tetracyclines, and quinolones antibiotics. CMNPs prepared at 850 degrees C are highly graphitized (80 %) and have strong adsorption affinity to all model analytes; however, they can quantitatively extract only highly polar sulfonamide antibiotics and moderately polar DEP, DPP because of hard desorption of other model analytes. We suggest that the appropriate adsorbent to certain organic contaminants can be obtained with this technique just by tuning the heat temperature without any post-treatment...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Phthalates are organic {{lipophilic}} compounds {{which are}} mainly used as plasticizer {{to increase the}} flexibility of plastic polymers. Another application {{is the use of}} phthalates in printing inks and adhesives. Human exposure occurs mainly via food intake and can cause a wide range of negative health effects (e. g. disruption of the endocrine system). In this study, the effect of cooking at home on phthalate concentrations in various foodstuffs was investigated. Methods and materials: Food products that are eaten regularly by the Belgian population – i. e. potato, rice, pasta, carrot, cauliflower, onion, paprika, minced meat, pork chop and salmon – were purchased from Belgian shops. In most cases, several cultivars, varieties and/or packaging types of a food product were bought. Food samples were boiled, steamed, fried, deep-fried and/or grilled in a way a normal Belgian household would do. Phthalate concentrations were determined in uncooked as well as in cooked food products via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Eight phthalates were taken into account: dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), benzylbutyl phthalate (BBP), di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), <b>dicyclohexyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DCHP) and di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP). Results: DMP, DnBP, DCHP and DnOP were rarely present (less or equal than/to 50 % detectable) in the investigated food samples. On the other hand, DEP, DiBP, BBP and DEHP were regularly detected, but differences in detection frequencies were noticed between uncooked and cooked food samples. For example, DEHP was determined in all uncooked foods, but after cooking, this compound was detectable in only 65. 4 % of the samples. Phthalate concentrations in food usually declined after cooking, which is demonstrated in Figure 1 for DiBP in pasta samples. Furthermore, differences in phthalate concentrations were observed between cultivars, varieties and/or packaging types of a certain food product (see also Figure 1). Conclusions: In general, cooking processes at home cause a decline in phthalate concentrations in food.
