5|$|<b>Food</b> <b>power</b> is an {{integral}} part of the politics of food. The idea of <b>food</b> <b>power</b> is used in embargoes, employment, and food politics. In order for a nation to utilize <b>food</b> <b>power</b> effectively, the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity, supply concentration, demand dispersion, and action independence. The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert <b>food</b> <b>power</b> are the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. On the smaller scale, particularly in some African countries, <b>food</b> <b>power</b> has been used as a weapon by opposing sides in internal wars and conflicts against their own people.|$|E
5|$|Food {{security}} and <b>food</b> <b>power</b> {{are not the}} same thing. However, they are often directly related. Food security is when all people of a region at all times have enough food for an active, healthy life. <b>Food</b> <b>power</b> is related when a government, company, leader, country etc. takes this security away in order to get something in return. Many countries employ the exploit of <b>food</b> <b>power</b> to threaten another country's food security. A country's welfare correlates directly with the welfare of its people therefore each country wants to have an appropriate supply of food for its citizens. This want, however, can easily be used as leverage in the politics of food, demonstrating <b>food</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the United States posed a grain embargo upon the Soviet Union. This {{was an attempt}} by the U.S. utilize <b>food</b> <b>power,</b> however, it was not confirmed. The Soviets thus {{imported}} grain from different suppliers, leading to an increase in grain imports during that time period, only at a higher cost. Another unsuccessful embargo <b>food</b> <b>power</b> attempt was imposed by the UN Security Council in 1990 with Iraq.|$|E

5|$|An embargo is not {{the same}} as <b>Food</b> <b>Power,</b> however, <b>food</b> <b>power</b> can be used in an embargo. In fact, embargoes that do not involve food in their list of {{restricted}} items often fail. For example, on August 20, 1914 the Allied Powers began an embargo on important items that were normally shipped to Germany. However, the embargo was not complete nor effective until food was added to the list of restricted materials. Food has the real power. After food was introduced the blockade began to strangle Germany's economy because they were dependent on imports for food. Because the Allied Powers used the power of food in their embargo, Germany was forced to resort to desperate measures and eventually failed despite them.|$|E
5|$|Food {{politics}} are the political {{aspects of the}} production, control, regulation, inspection and distribution of food. The politics can {{be affected by the}} ethical, cultural, medical and environmental disputes concerning proper farming, agricultural and retailing methods and regulations. <b>Food</b> <b>power</b> {{is an integral part of}} the politics of food.|$|E
5|$|In {{international}} politics, <b>food</b> <b>power</b> {{is the use}} {{of agriculture}} as a means of political control whereby one nation or group of nations offers or withholds commodities from another nation or group of nations in order to manipulate behavior. Its potential use as a weapon was recognised after OPEC’s earlier use of oil as a political weapon. Food has a major influence on political actions of a nation. In response to acts of <b>food</b> <b>power,</b> a nation usually acts in the interest of its citizens to provide food.|$|E

5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This {{is the result of}} a drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, <b>food</b> <b>power</b> makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.|$|E
5|$|Food {{politics}} in Africa {{differs from the}} cases in North America and Europe in {{that there is a}} case of small scale <b>food</b> <b>power</b> in Africa, particularly in Sudan. Some experts say that the cases of famine and food insecurity in Africa are due to inconsistent output of food production and the downward spiral of the interaction between population growth and environmental sustainability. But upon closer inspection, it is revealed that nature is not the only catalyst for Africa’s numerous food insecurity issues.|$|E
5|$|There are {{alternative}} uses of <b>food</b> <b>power</b> as well. An importer can {{refuse to}} continue import unless political concessions are made. This {{would have the}} same effects that an exporter refusing to export would have. An example of this would be American reduction of the Cuban sugar quota. In simple terms, the demand concentration (one importer being the dominant buyer) and supply dispersion (several exporters competing to sell the same product) an importer can try to use this exchange politically to their favor; this is especially effective if the exporter has little else so export (low action independence).|$|E

40|$|Staple {{food prices}} in cities in eastern and {{southern}} Africa rose sharply between late 2007 and early 2009, leading to estimates of massive increases in food insecurity and hunger. However, in assessing the impacts of soaring food prices on urban consumers' access to food {{it is important to}} consider food price changes relative to changes in per capita incomes. In this study, we use the case studies of Zambia and Kenya, where data are available on food prices, wage rates, incomes, and other indicators of urban purchasing power to answer two main questions: (i) how did staple <b>food</b> purchasing <b>power</b> at the height of the food price crisis compare to levels over the last 15 Â years? and (ii) did the food price crisis exacerbate an already declining trend in staple <b>food</b> purchasing <b>power,</b> or did it reverse a trend of stable or improving staple food affordability? Results indicate that staple <b>food</b> purchasing <b>power</b> in urban Zambia and Kenya improved markedly in the 10 - 12 Â years prior to the food price crisis. Most measures of bread and maize meal affordability at the start of the crisis in 2007 were at levels 1. 0 - 4. 3 times higher than in the mid- 1990 s. These gains for urban consumers were slashed but not completely reversed during the food crisis. Between 2007 and 2009, maize meal and bread were still more affordable in urban Zambia than all periods between 1994 and 2003. In urban Kenya, staple <b>food</b> purchasing <b>power</b> as of 2008 / 2009 was comparable to levels in 2000 / 2001 - 2004 / 2005 according to some indicators, while other measures suggest that the food price crisis reduced staple <b>food</b> purchasing <b>power</b> to levels lower than any other year in the period 1994 / 1995 - 2007 / 2008.

5|$|For example, Sudan’s {{famine in}} the 1980s was {{completely}} intentional, {{and was only}} a pawn for a varied collection of different elites to improve their political and economic statuses. These political parties weren’t the only beneficiaries, though. Merchants were also known to hoard grain and buy livestock at inappropriately low prices when the famines shifted the terms of trade. Western Sudanese merchants during the famine of 1987 were described as heartless because they refused to sell grain to needy villages in Darfur at reasonable prices. Ergo, the Sudanese Famine was another example of <b>food</b> <b>power</b> in which food was and used as a policy, and which completely ignored {{the needs of the}} people and fostered the political and power-hungry intentions of opposite warring forces in the country.|$|E

500|$|During {{the time}} the United States was the most {{dominant}} in all areas like military, energy, exports, etc. <b>Food</b> <b>Power</b> was not really thought about. [...] However, since some of those powers have since diminished, the power of food {{has come to the}} surface. In the realm of food, The United States remains at the top, unchallenged. The United States has the position of being the largest producer and exporter of food. [...] While others nations, predominantly developing nations but even some of the richest oil-exporting nations, are beginning to have food shortages and becoming more and more dependent on imported food from the United States, giving it more and more power. This allows the United States to expect friendly behavior from the countries that import American food. [...] It is also likely that the United States would have some form of influence over these countries. Even some of the poorest OPEC countries have become dependent on U.S. wheat. Therefore, {{there is a possibility that}} the United States could restrict its food exports for political purposes. [...] The United States could use this <b>Food</b> <b>power</b> as a means of exerting pressure on OPEC countries. [...] <b>Food</b> <b>power</b> will be most effective in times of food shortage or famine because this is when those countries that have some dependence on the United States are most desperate.|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} uses for {{employing}} economic weapons against one country or another. One use for using economic weapons would concern the seller/buyer bargaining on {{the conditions of}} a business contract. This would include price, transportation, timetable for consignment and payment, etc. [...] Although {{this is an example}} of the successful application of <b>food</b> <b>power,</b> it is not a political objective. Another use concerns the economic objectives other than these relating to the transaction of goods; to the general economic policy of the buyer. This would be balance of payments, general problems, such as inflation or taxation and land holding. [...] What distinguishes this from the first is the fact that there is no link between the conditions laid down and the transfer of product. The conditions refer to the economic realm of life. [...] A political use would be one concerning the buyer’s foreign and defense policies. [...] Many believe there is a moral threshold between economy and politics, making the use of economic means for political gains questionable. [...] Examples of the use of economic weapons for political aims are boycotts against certain countries as well as the buying of votes in the UN. A fourth purpose pertains to the basic assumption of the third category: the governments no longer accept each other as legitimate. [...] The economic goals are no longer seen as a means of influencing an opposite government but rather to stimulate opposition and achieve the overthrow or capitulation of the government.|$|E

40|$|The Food Stamp Program is {{designed}} to provide low-income families with increased <b>food</b> purchasing <b>power</b> to obtain a nutritionally adequate diet. As in most other Federal Government assistance programs, benefits are adjusted in response to rising prices—in this case, rising food prices. The current method of adjustment results in a shortfall between the maximum food stamp benefit and the cost of a nutritionally adequate diet as specified by USDA’s Thrifty Food Plan. During fiscal year (FY) 2007, the food purchasing shortfall in the caseload-weighted maximum benefit for the program grew from $ 7 in October 2006 to $ 19 in September 2007. In FY 2008, the amount grew from almost $ 8 in October 2007 to $ 34 in July 2008 and to $ 38 in September 2008. In an average month, food stamp households faced shortfalls of over $ 2 in FY 2003, $ 12 in FY 2007, and $ 22 in FY 2008. These losses in <b>food</b> purchasing <b>power</b> account for 1 percent, 4 percent, and 7 percent of the maximum benefit in each respective year.
