5|$|It is poetic {{justice that}} a {{helicopter}} {{is now at}} the heart of the Government's <b>embarrassment</b> <b>and</b> in the centre of their dilemma. Indeed, it was hard to blame the prison officer who observed that he thought it was the Minister for Defence paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday because, of course, we all know the Minister for Defence is wont to use helicopters, as somebody observed already, as other Ministers are wont to use State cars.|$|E
5|$|Raymond Dumbell{Sic} (Ray) Tarbuck {{was born}} in Philadelphia on 4 May 1897. His middle name caused him <b>embarrassment</b> <b>and</b> was seldom used, and he {{preferred}} the shortened form of his first name. He was educated at Philadelphia Central High School and the Philadelphia College of Pedagogy, where he studied to be a teacher, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He also attended the Naval Academy Preparatory School.|$|E
5|$|Some correctional facilities, like San Quentin State Prison, require {{visitors}} to either cut their bras {{and remove the}} underwire, or temporarily use a soft cup bra provided by the institution before being granted entry. The result can be <b>embarrassment</b> <b>and</b> consternation for unsuspecting visitors. Other facilities require women to remove their underwire bras in a bathroom, pass through the metal detector, {{and return to the}} bathroom to put their bras back on.|$|E

5|$|He {{was shot}} down most {{probably}} by Italian Spanish Civil War ace Tenente Lieutenant) Franco Lucchini of 90a Squadriglia, 10° Gruppo ("group"), 4° Stormo ("wing"). He landed, winded, and played dead to avoid being strafed. He started to walk towards the Allied lines and crossed the border at around midday the following day. After two days, he was rescued by a detachment from the 11th Hussars, who returned him to Sidi Barrani. Pattle was annoyed. He considered being shot down by the Italians as an <b>embarrassment</b> <b>and</b> regarded the episode as a slur on his reputation. After his forced march to friendly lines, he was also determined not {{to get lost in}} the desert again so he flew to Alexandria and bought a compass which he never flew without.|$|E
5|$|Amy Wyatt is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the ITV soap opera, Emmerdale, played by Chelsea Halfpenny. She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 8 October 2010. Since her inception Amy has {{been central to}} main storylines and has been played as the serial's rebellious teenager. Halfpenny has said she enjoys playing the character's mischievous side. Amy's unstable upbringing in children's homes and foster care has impacted on her persona. She is a troubled character and protects herself by creating a hard exterior. Amy's biggest fear is <b>embarrassment</b> <b>and</b> she aspires to lead a normal family life with her foster parents Val and Eric Pollard. As her storylines have developed she has grown close to the pair, yet rebelled at various stages. Charlie Hardwick and Chris Chittell who play Val and Eric have expressed their delight with the positive impact Amy has had on their on-screen family. She has a kooky style and wears heavy make-up.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) asks Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to {{accompany}} him to the Six Sigmas Retreat in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, following his Bush administration and CEO debacles. There, Jack meets with the Six Sigmas, six men who each embody a core feature of Six Sigma: teamwork, insight, brutality, male enhancement, hand-shake-fulness and play-hard. They disapprove of Liz's antics during the team building exercises and demand that Jack distance himself from her {{if he wants to}} succeed, which he does. Before his dinner speech, Jack psyches himself up in the men's room, completely forgetting that he is wearing a microphone and that everyone can hear him. Liz quickly takes the stage to draw attention away from Jack's <b>embarrassment</b> <b>and</b> finally ends up ripping her blouse open and dancing in front of everyone. She succeeds, and is banned from the retreat forever.|$|E

5|$|The {{directorship}} of Neil MacGregor saw a major rehang at the Gallery, {{dispensing with}} {{the classification of}} paintings by national school that had been introduced by Eastlake. The new chronological hang sought to emphasise the interaction between cultures rather than fixed national characteristics, reflecting the change in art historical values since the 19th century. In other respects, however, Victorian tastes were rehabilitated: the building's interiors were no longer considered an <b>embarrassment</b> <b>and</b> were restored, and in 1999 the Gallery accepted a bequest of 26 Italian Baroque paintings from Sir Denis Mahon. Earlier in the 20th century many considered the Baroque to be beyond the pale: in 1945 the Gallery's trustees declined to buy a Guercino from Mahon's collection for £200. The same painting was valued at £4million in 2003. Mahon's bequest was made {{on the condition that}} the Gallery would never deaccession any of its paintings or charge for admission.|$|E
5|$|To Lenin's <b>embarrassment</b> <b>and</b> horror, in April 1920 the Bolsheviks held a {{party to}} {{celebrate}} his fiftieth birthday, which was also marked by widespread celebrations across Russia and the publication of poems and biographies dedicated to him. Between 1920 and 1926, twenty volumes of Lenin's Collected Works were published; some material was omitted. During 1920, several prominent Western figures visited Lenin in Russia; these included the author H. G. Wells and the philosopher Bertrand Russell, {{as well as the}} anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. Lenin was also visited at the Kremlin by Armand, who was in increasingly poor health. He sent her to a sanatorium in Kislovodsk in the Northern Caucasus to recover, but she died there in September 1920 during a cholera epidemic. Her body was transported to Moscow, where a visibly grief-stricken Lenin oversaw her burial beneath the Kremlin Wall.|$|E

25|$|From 104 BC onwards, each legion used an aquila (eagle) as its {{standard}} symbol. The symbol {{was carried}} by an officer known as aquilifer, and its loss {{was considered to}} be a very serious <b>embarrassment,</b> <b>and</b> often led to the disbanding of the legion itself. Normally, this was because any legion incapable of regaining its eagle in battle was so severely mauled that it was no longer effective in combat.|$|E

25|$|Although some locals {{welcomed the}} fence and {{regarded}} it as a tourist attraction, others viewed it as an eyesore and <b>embarrassment,</b> <b>and</b> as a potential hazard to drivers using the road.

25|$|While not as profoundly {{disabling}} as {{the physical}} symptoms of these diseases, PBA can significantly influence individuals' social functioning and {{their relationships with}} others. Such sudden, frequent, extreme, uncontrollable emotional outbursts may lead to social withdrawal and interfere with activities of daily living, social and professional pursuits, and reduce overall healthcare. For example, patients with ALS and MS are often cognitively normal. However, the appearance of uncontrollable emotions is commonly associated with many additional neurological disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, autism, epilepsy, and migraines. This may lead to severe <b>embarrassment</b> <b>and</b> avoidance of social interactions for the patient, which in turn impairs their coping mechanisms and their careers.|$|E
25|$|The {{premise of}} such a working {{relationship}} is established in the pilot episode when Fraser requests to be posted to Chicago, {{to ensure that the}} Chicago Police follow his leads in the investigation of the murder of Fraser's father, while there is still a higher probability of catching the killer. He meets Detective Vecchio, the officer assigned to the case, he initially dismisses it until he meets Fraser. In the process, he also exposes an environmental corruption scandal involving some members of the RCMP, causing much <b>embarrassment</b> <b>and</b> loss of jobs in his native Northwest Territories, which leaves him persona non grata in Canada and within the RCMP and posted permanently to Chicago.|$|E
25|$|The third book {{provides}} more {{details of the}} love triangle that has erupted between Fyodor, his son Dmitri, and Grushenka.

Later that evening, Dmitri bursts into his father's house and assaults him while threatening {{to come back and}} kill him in the future. This book also introduces Smerdyakov and his origins, as well as the story of his mother, Reeking Lizaveta. At the conclusion of this book, Alyosha is witness to Grushenka's bitter humiliation of Dmitri's betrothed Katerina, resulting in terrible <b>embarrassment</b> <b>and</b> scandal for this proud woman.|$|E

40|$|Regarding {{self-conscious}} emotions, {{studies have}} shown that different forms of perfectionism show different relationships with pride, shame, <b>and</b> <b>embarrassment</b> depending on success and failure. What is unknown is whether these relationships also show cultural variations. Therefore, we conducted a study investigating how self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism predicted pride <b>and</b> <b>embarrassment</b> after success <b>and</b> failure comparing 363 British and 352 Japanese students. Students {{were asked to respond to}} a set of scenarios where they imagined achieving either perfect (success) or flawed results (failure). In both British and Japanese students, self-oriented perfectionism positively predicted pride after success <b>and</b> <b>embarrassment</b> after failure whereas socially prescribed perfectionism predicted <b>embarrassment</b> after success <b>and</b> failure. Moreover, in Japanese students, socially prescribed perfectionism positively predicted pride after success and self-oriented perfectionism negatively predicted pride after failure. The findings have implications for our understanding of perfectionism indicating that the perfectionism–pride relationship not only varies between perfectionism dimensions, but may also show cultural variations...|$|R
