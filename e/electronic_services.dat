40|$|Government {{all over}} the world are {{increasingly}} realizing that implementing and sustaining their <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> delivery is the way forward to achieve efficiency savings and to satisfy and engage demanding constituents. Once an <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> delivery has been developed and the infrastructure is in place, they are almost infinitely scalable with minimal effort, and will reduce variable costs of <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> provisioning and service use. As this trend continues, academics, IT professionals and decision makers need a deeper understanding of <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> initiatives sustainability. Yet, analysis of IS academic literature reveals that <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> initiatives sustainability, has received little in depth attention. This paper investigates the current state of <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> initiatives sustainability research in IS literature.

40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>service</b> {{delivery}} is {{closely tied to}} legal decision making. Legal decision making is by nature complicated. It involves the (strict) application of rules, but it also inevitably leaves room for discretion. If the ambition of <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> {{delivery is}} taken seriously, this means that (some) legal decisions {{have to be taken}} by computers. Legal knowledge based systems (LKBSs) capable of performing this task have been around since the early nineteen nineties. These systems, although successful, never really broke through and are somewhat forgotten. With the advent of e-Government and its focus on <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> delivery, legal decision making systems are desperately needed. This paper argues that legal knowledge based system technology is neglected undeserved and that it offers opportunities for serious <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> delivery...|$|R
2500|$|The University Library is {{the main}} library of the university, and {{constitutes}} together with the decentralized libraries of the faculties and institutes, the integral university library system comprising approximately 6.7 million printed books. It is Germany's most frequently used library, and it is currently placed 1st in a ranking of Germany's best libraries. The University Library's stocks exceeded one million in 1934. Today, it holds about 3.2 million books, about 500,000 other media such as microfilms and video tapes, as well as 10,732 scientific periodicals. Moreover, it holds 6,600 manuscripts, most notably the Codex Manesse, 1,800 incunabula, 110,500 autographs, {{and a collection of}} old maps, paintings, and photographs. The further 83 decentralized libraries of the faculties and institutes hold another 3.5 million printed books. In 2005, 34,500 active users of the University Library accessed 1.4 million books a year. The conventional book supply is complemented by numerous <b>electronic</b> <b>services.</b> Around 3,000 commercial scientific journals can be accessed via e-journal. The University Library of today traces its roots back to the purchase of a chest of documents by the first Rector Marsilius von Inghen in 1388, which was stored in the Heiliggeistkirche, then the University Cathedral. Since 1978, the science branch of the University Library serves the institutes of natural sciences and medicine on the New Campus. In 2016, extensive refurbishments were finalized with the University Library now housing additional study spaces.|$|E

The paper adds to existing evidence that the nature of <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> delivery is heavily influenced by the agencies that introduce it and by the context in which it occurs. The shape of <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> delivery in social housing was found to be heavily influenced by the high complexity of transactions between social landlords and tenants, and by the ethos of some social landlords. The research also suggested there was a broad consensus between social landlords and tenants with regard to the practical limits of online services.

40|$|Purpose – to {{distinguish}} the main theoretical aspects and peculiarities of implementation of <b>electronic</b> public <b>services</b> in EU and Lithuania and to give recommendations in order to implement these services in {{a higher level of}} efficiency. Design/methodology/approach – scientific literature, legal documents and statistical data analysis methods have been used. An expert qualitative opinion survey was carried out, in which nine experts were interviewed (The Republic of Lithuania’s Ministry of Interior E-government policy division specialists). The survey aims to clarify the basic problems, principles of <b>electronic</b> public <b>services</b> implementation and the development perspective of these services in Lithuania. Findings – after analyzing the main peculiarities of <b>electronic</b> public <b>services</b> implementation in the EU and Lithuania, recommendations in relation to <b>electronic</b> public <b>service</b> improvement perspective were introduced. Research limitations/implications – after analyzing theoretical aspects of <b>electronic</b> public <b>services</b> implementation, peculiarities of <b>electronic</b> public <b>services</b> implementation in the EU and Lithuania, and doing a quantitative study, the basic principles were determined, on which the <b>electronic</b> public <b>services</b> are implemented in the EU and Lithuania. Also, the main problems were encountered in implementing <b>electronic</b> public <b>services,</b> best practices in the EU countries, regulation and development perspectives of electonic public services in Lithuania. Practical implications – the most important electronic government (hereinafter – e-government) services development principles, problems, best practices, regulation and development perspective of Lithuania reflect the practical implications.
