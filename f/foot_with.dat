5|$|Fishers {{have five}} toes on each <b>foot,</b> <b>with</b> unsheathed, {{retractable}} claws. Their feet are disproportionately large for their legs, {{making it easier}} for them to move on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, there are four central pads on each foot. On the hind paws there are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking on a variety of surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180 degrees, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first. The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.|$|E

5|$|The {{external}} {{anatomy of}} the soft parts of this species {{is similar to that}} of other strombid snails. The animal has an elongate snout, thin eyestalks with well-developed eyes and sensory tentacles, and a narrow, strong <b>foot</b> <b>with</b> a sickle-shaped operculum. A molecular analysis conducted in 2006 based on DNA sequences of histone and mitochondrial genes demonstrated that Laevistrombus canarium, Doxander vittatus and Labiostrombus epidromis are closely related species. The dog conch exhibits behaviours common among Strombidae, including burrowing and a characteristic leaping form of locomotion. The former behaviour, however, involves movement sequences unique to this species.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{spends much}} of its time climbing trees, and has adaptations to this lifestyle, {{many of which are}} shared by other woodpecker species. These include the zygodactyl arrangement of the <b>foot,</b> <b>with</b> two toes facing forward and two back, and the stiff tail feathers that are used as a prop against the trunk. In most birds the bones of the tail diminish in size towards its end, but this does not occur in woodpeckers, and the final vertebra, the pygostyle, is very large to anchor the strong tail muscles.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{wide range}} of names for other types of feet, right up to a choriamb, a four {{syllable}} metric <b>foot</b> <b>with</b> a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables and closing with a stressed syllable. The choriamb is derived from some ancient Greek and Latin poetry. Languages which utilize vowel length or intonation rather than or in addition to syllabic accents in determining meter, such as Ottoman Turkish or Vedic, often have concepts similar to the iamb and dactyl to describe common combinations of long and short sounds.|$|E

5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pokémon {{characterized}} by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. They {{look like they}} are wearing armor, as they have two pauldron-shaped pieces on their shoulders and a fauld-like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have three fingers on each hand and three toes on each <b>foot,</b> <b>with</b> two toes in the front on either side {{and one in the}} back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After evolving into Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the Zener markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega Evolving into Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a white beard alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner torso, and a red gem-like organ on its forehead.|$|E
5|$|Aoyama collapses {{from the}} drug. Asami injects {{him with a}} paralytic agent that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that just like {{everyone}} else in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot tolerate his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left <b>foot</b> <b>with</b> piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems to be only a nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police and stares at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E
5|$|At about 11pm, the rioters {{arrived at}} the house of the Reverend John Vachell, who, after {{threatening}} to shoot anyone who entered his house, was disarmed when threemen rushed him. He fled on <b>foot</b> <b>with</b> his wife and two daughters towards Ely. After Vachell had left, the rioters destroyed his goods and chattels and stole some of his silverware. Vachell was later to sue the Hundred of Ely for the damages under the Riot Act. He received over £708 (£), an award which was challenged in the press, as many people complained {{about the size of the}} resulting district levies used to pay for it. The rioters then stopped a post-chaise returning with Hugh Robert Evans senior and Henry Martin from a Turnpike Trust meeting in Downham. They robbed Evans of 14shillings (£) before allowing them both to proceed. On reaching Ely, Evans alerted the magistrates who sent a carriage for Reverend Vachell, which collected him and his family walking towards Ely.|$|E

40|$|Diabet. Med. 29, 15341541 (2012) Abstract Aims Custom-made {{therapeutic}} footwear {{is often}} prescribed to patients <b>with</b> diabetic neuropathy, <b>foot</b> deformity and a healed plantar foot ulcer. Offloading these feet {{is important to}} prevent ulcer recurrence. The aim was to evaluate the offloading effect of custom-made footwear in these patients. Methods In 171 patients with diabetic neuropathy (336 <b>feet)</b> <b>with</b> <b>foot</b> deformity and a recently healed plantar foot ulcer, plantar pressures walking barefoot and inside new custom-made footwear were measured. At the previous ulcer location and at locations of highest barefoot pressure attributable to the deformity, in-shoe pressures were compared <b>with</b> non-deformed <b>feet.</b> The footwear was considered effective in offloading when in-shoe peak pressure at these locations was < 200 kPa. Results Mean in-shoe peak pressures ranged between 211 and 308 kPa in <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> forefoot deformity (vs. 191222 kPa in non-deformed feet) and between 140 and 187 kPa in <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> midfoot deformity (vs. 112 kPa in non-deformed feet). Offloading was effective in 61 % of all <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> deformity, 81 % of <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> midfoot deformity, 44 % of <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> forefoot deformity and 62 % of previous ulcer locations. Inter-subject variability in measured in-shoe plantar pressure was large. Conclusions Offloading in custom-made footwear is often not sufficiently achieved in high-risk diabetic <b>feet</b> <b>with</b> deformity. Highest offloading success rates were seen at known high-risk locations such as previous ulcer locations and Charcot feet, the lowest success rates in forefoot deformities. Together with the large inter-subject variability in pressure outcomes, this emphasizes the need for evidence-based prescription and evaluation procedures to assure adequate offloadin...|$|R
5|$|In {{the absence}} of Bangladesh's opening bowler, Mortaza, Australia opened the innings with Andrew Symonds and Michael Bevan— giving the usual middle-order batsmen time at the crease. The Symonds {{experiment}} did not last long, as he was dismissed by Hasibul Hossain for seven. Martyn joined Bevan at the crease and quickly put the bowlers on the back <b>foot</b> <b>with</b> aggressive batting. Despite returning in the series {{for the first time}} since the 2003 Cricket World Cup because of a broken finger, he scored Australia's second fastest ODI half-century22 ballsand was on track to overtake Gilchrist's and Allan Border's record for the fastest Australian ODI century; 78 deliveries. Together they added 131 runs from 91 balls, seeing Australia home by nine wickets. Named man of the match, Martyn finished with 92 from 51 balls, dominating the partnership with Bevan, who scored 40 from 62 balls. Martyn was especially severe on Bangladeshi captain Khaled Mahmud, hitting three fours and a six from successive balls in Mahmud's second over. The captain finished with the unflattering figures of 0/34 from three overs.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} a large and {{powerful}} <b>foot</b> <b>with</b> brown spots and markings towards the edge, but is white nearer to the visceral hump that stays inside the shell and accommodates internal organs. The base of the anterior end of the foot has a distinct groove, which contains {{the opening of the}} pedal gland. Attached to the posterior end of the foot for about one third of its length is the dark brown, corneous, sickle-shaped operculum, which is reinforced by a distinct central rib. The base of the posterior two-thirds of the animal's foot is rounded; only the anterior third touches the ground during locomotion. The columella, the central pillar within the shell, serves as the attachment point for the white columellar muscle. Contraction of this strong muscle allows the animal's soft parts to shelter in the shell in response to undesirable stimuli.|$|E
5|$|A set of iron carpenter's tools {{from the}} 3rd-4th century, {{including}} a compass for marking circles, {{was found in}} Przywóz, Wieluń County, {{where there was a}} Przeworsk culture settlement and a 2nd/3rd century dynastic burial complex. The graves of Przeworsk men typically include substantial collections of arms, so that their warrior's battle equipment and its evolution are well known. Less wealthy warriors fought typically on <b>foot,</b> <b>with</b> spears (for close range combat) and javelins (for throwing), both with iron heads. The better off fighters used swords, first of the long Celtic kind, and then in the 1st and 2nd century AD of the short and broad, gladius Roman infantry type. Swords were kept in sheaths, some of which, depending on status, were very ornate. The long and narrow swords, better suited for horseback combat, became popular again in the 3rd century, but only the more wealthy warriors had horses, not to mention iron helmets or ring armor. Round wooden shields had iron umbos in the middle, usually with a thorn for piercing the enemy. There were no saddles, but the richest of horsemen used silver spurs and bronze bridles with chain reins. Numerous Przeworsk culture objects including spurs and a unique silver belt buckle were recovered at the Aleksandrowice, Kraków County settlement area; some relics there are dated possibly as late as {{the first half of the}} 6th century.|$|E

5|$|Blum {{appeared}} in his first NHL game {{on the night of}} his first call-up, registering a -1 plus-minus rating in 16 minutes of ice time; the Predators lost 4–0 to the Columbus Blue Jackets. In a rematch with Columbus five days later, he scored his first NHL goal against Mathieu Garon in a 3–2 win. Remaining with the Predators {{for the remainder of the}} campaign, Blum recorded 3 goals and 8 points over 23 NHL games while averaging 17 minutes and 45 seconds of ice time per contest. Making his Stanley Cup playoffs debut in Game 1 of the opening round against the Anaheim Ducks, Blum helped the Predators to a 4–1 win with one assist. The following game, Ducks forward Bobby Ryan stomped on Blum's <b>foot</b> <b>with</b> his skate while the two players were tied up behind the Predators' net. Blum was not injured on the play, while Ryan was given a two-game suspension for the play. The Predators went on to eliminate the Ducks in six games, advancing to the second round, where they were defeated by the Vancouver Canucks. Blum finished the 2011 playoffs with two assists over 12 games. Following the elimination, Blum was reassigned to the Admirals for their 2011 playoff season. He dressed for one game, an elimination match against the Houston Aeros in the second round, which Milwaukee lost.|$|E
5|$|In 1786, Lord Cornwallis was {{appointed}} Governor-general, {{and the war}} against Tippu Sultan was resumed after Tippu attacked British allies in 1789. (This {{was known as the}} Third Mysore war). Initially, military actions were fairly minor. In 1790, the 52nd were involved at Pollighautcherry and in a battle near Seringapatam. In 1791, the regiment fought at Bangalore in March, and Arakere (near Seringapatam) in May. In December that year, the flank companies from the 52nd and 76th <b>Foot,</b> <b>with</b> sepoy grenadiers, formed the storming party during the assault on Savandroog; the defenders abandoned the fortress, and it was successfully taken at the cost of just one British soldier wounded. Throughout the assault, the band of the 52nd played to spur on the attackers. The 52nd were also present at the February 1792 siege of Seringapatam, where the battalion's grenadier company received heavy casualties while crossing the Kaveri River. During that battle, the 52nd came to the aid of Lord Cornwallis, whose companies were exposed and in danger of capture. Tippu Sultan sued for peace during the siege, and a treaty was signed in 1792, ending the war. However, in August 1793 the regiment took part in an assault on Pondicherry.|$|E
5|$|May {{brought on}} the {{part-time}} spin of Brian Close and 15 runs came in two overs, helping Davidson {{to feel more}} at ease. At the time, Allen had bowled 25 maidens in 37 overs. Davidson responded to the situation by hitting Allen out of the attack. In Allen's 10th over for the day, Davidson took 20 runs. He lofted an off drive over the boundary for six, and drove through the covers for four from both {{the front and back}} foot. Davidson then hit the bowler out of the stadium onto the adjacent railway lines. Fred Trueman came on and struck Davidson on the <b>foot</b> <b>with</b> a yorker. Davidson responded with a three and a cut for four that brought up Australia's 400. He ended with a hard-hitting 77 not out, after a final wicket partnership of 98 in 102 minutes. This extended Australia's lead to 256 on the last day and gave them hope of stopping England from winning the match. England looked to be heading towards victory with seven wickets in hand and less than 100 runs required, but a Benaud-inspired collapse saw Australia home by 54 runs. Davidson knocked Brian Statham's off stump out of the ground to end the match and ended with 2/50. It was Australia's first victory at Old Trafford since 1902 and sealed the series.|$|E
