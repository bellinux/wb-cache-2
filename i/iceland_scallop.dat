50|$|The <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallop</b> (Chlamys islandica) is {{a species}} of bivalve mollusc in the family Pectinidae. This North Atlantic scallop {{attaches}} itself to hard surfaces such as rocks {{and can be found}} from the intertidal zone to a depth of 200 m.|$|E
40|$|The {{sustainability}} of the <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallop</b> fishery {{is one of}} the conservation issues associated with the Gilbert Bay Marine Protected Area in southeastern Labrador. The average size of <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallop</b> in Gilbert Bay is significantly smaller than the average scallop size in the nearby Strait of Belle Isle. Local fishers have suggested this could be due to a slower growth rate of scallops in the MPA. [...] To estimate the growth rate of scallops in Gilbert Bay, three methods of determining the age of scallops were used: counting external shell growth rings, counting shell hinge ligament growth zones, and counting internal shell layer growth increments. No significant difference was found between the ligament and internal shell methods of aging, but both methods were significantly different from the external shell growth ring method. Counting hinge ligament growth zones was recommended as the most accurate and most convenient method. The growth parameters of <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallop</b> in Gilbert Bay were found by fitting the von Bertalanffy equation to the shell height-at-age data. Based on counting hinge ligament growth zones, the von Bertalanffy model found asymptotic shell height (SHoo) of scallops in Gilbert Bay was 117 mm with a growth parameter K of 0. 07 year⁻¹. Scallop growth in Gilbert Bay is not significantly different from scallop growth in the Strait of Belle Isle and not significantly different from scallop growth in the Nuuk area of West Greenland. [...] No significant difference was found in variation of scallop growth throughout Gilbert Bay. Scallops in Gilbert Bay are currently smaller than in the Strait of Belle Isle, likely due to factors other than growth rate, such as variance in recruitment, natural mortality or fishing mortality. Refined harvesting regulations could ensure the {{sustainability of}} <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallop</b> populations in Gilbert Bay...|$|E
40|$|Sea {{temperature}} {{is one of}} the primary factor limiting the overall geographical range of most marine species, including the Icelandic scallop. In Iceland, the sub-arctic Icelandic scallop resides at its southern limits. As a result, {{it is likely to be}} especially vulnerable to changes in the immediate environment. During the last 5 years, the stock size of <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallop</b> in Breidifjordur on the West coast of Iceland has undergone a dramatic decline. This period has been characterized by steady increase in summer sea temperature and in 2003 the temperature had reached a historical maximum of the last century. As well, since 1998, there have been fluctuations in chl-a level, with the lowest values observed in 1999 and 2000. At the same time, muscle weight has declined and a minimum weight was attained in 2001 - 2002. In the following years, natural mortality of scallops in Breidifjordur increased significantly. The mortality was however quite localized within the main fishing area in the southern part of Breidifjordur. At the same time two Coccidia parasites have been described in <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallop</b> from Breidifjordur. These parasite may have influenced the survival of the scallops. Recruitment into the fishable stock in Breidifjordur was highly variable during the 1993 - 2003, with low recruitment towards the end of the 1990 ’s. Due to high total fishing mortality during the 1990 - 2000, the fishery depended on relatively few year classes. Therefore the fragile status of the stock did not endure the medium-high exploitation rates in conjunction with several years of poor recruitment...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{removing}} adductor muscles (meat) through manual shucking of <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallops</b> and sea scallops at sea results in loss of meat {{yield to the}} fishing industry. In the study of <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallops,</b> this loss was negatively correlated with shell size and decreased from about 30 % at 60 mm (shell height) to 11 % at 90 mm, with an average loss of 23 %. Meat recovery was somewhat more efficient from sea scallops, but paradoxically the loss in yield increased slightly with shell size from 8 % at 60 mm to 10 % at 90 mm. The average loss for commercial-sized sea scallops (~ 100 mm) {{was estimated to be}} 11 %. In addition to such factors as experience, speed and shucking habits of the fishermen, relative efficiency of meat extraction from the shells of the two species appears to be related to shell size, tenacity of shell closure and shell morphology (curvature) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} has been {{started on the}} <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallop,</b> Chlamys islandica (O. F. Müller). In northern Norway this species is mainly found in fjords with a narrow sill at the entrance and on a bottom with sand, gravel or shells in 10 - 60 m of depth. Some scallop beds (known from earlier times) have been extinguished during recent years, probably because of climatic changes. The <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallop</b> is sexually mature at a shell height of 30 - 45 mm and a supposed age of 3 - 5 yeras. The sexes are separate, spawning taking place in July-August. In the localities investigated, {{the size of the}} scallop varied between ten and 105 mm, with maximum abundance at 45 - 90 mm. Distinct growth rings have been interpreted as annual rings. Usually, scallops from two to 12 years old are present in the beds, the majority being eight or more years in age. The annual growth has been estimated to 5 - 10 mm during the first seven years, gradually decreasing to 1 - 2 mm in the older scallops. The shell proportions change with increasing size, the scallops getting relatively thicker, broader. The volume varies from about ten ml in scallops 45 mm high to 70 ml in 80 mm scallops, the total weight from ten gr to 65 gr in the same size interval. The weight of the edible meat, adductor muscle plus gonad, constitutes 15 - 25 per cent of the total weight. In commercial sized scallops (60 - 100 mm) the meat weighs from five to 30 grams. It is supposed that the scallop beds already mapped will support a minor commercial fishery...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the total}} and {{unexpected}} collapse of the <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallop,</b> Chlamys islandica, stocks around Iceland during the 2000 s, a commercial fishing ban has been imposed on this valuable resource since 2003. Following the initial identification of an apicomplexan parasite in the scallops, a long-term surveillance program was established to evaluate {{the effect of the}} parasite on the population. The infections were highly prevalent in all shell sizes throughout the study. However, the parasite only impacts mature scallops where they cause severe macroscopic changes, characterized by an extensively diminished and abnormally coloured adductor muscle. A highly significant relationship was observed between infection intensity and gonad and adductor muscle indices. The first four years of the study, were characterized by high infection intensity and very poor condition of the adductor muscle and gonads, whilst during subsequent years, infections gradually decreased and the condition of the scallops improved. Histopathological changes were restricted to the presence of apicomplexan zoites which were widely distributed, causing varying degrees of pathology in all organs. In heavy infections, muscular and connective tissues were totally necrotized, destroying significant parts of numerous organs, especially the adductor muscle, digestive gland and gonads. The progression of the disease was in good synchrony with the mortality rates and the subsequent decline observed in the scallop stock and recruitment indices. Our findings strongly suggest that the apicomplexan parasite {{played a major role in}} the collapse of the <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallop</b> stock in Breidafjordur. In addition to causing mortality, the infections significantly impact gonad development which contributes further to the collapse of the stock in the form of lower larval recruitment. Furthermore, compelling evidence exists that this apicomplexan pathogen is causing serious disease outbreaks in other scallop populations. Similar abnormal adductor muscles and the parasite itself have been identified or observed in association with other mass mortality events in several different scallop species and commercial stocks in the northern hemisphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} in northern Norway of the <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallop,</b> Chlamys islandica (O. F. Müller) has been mapped (Fig. s 3 - 7). The species is mostly {{found in the}} inner of fjords having one or two sills, 3 - 15 m deep inside the enthrance. The beds are mostly located on hard bottom with sand, gravel or stones in l 0 - 60 m of depth. A few small scallops are sometimes found on the outer side of the sill together {{with a number of}} larger empty shells. - It is supposed that the <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallop</b> is very sensitive to changes in temperature. In some fjords scallop beds existing some years ago have been extinguished, probably because of a sudden rise in temperature. The species is sexually mature at a shell breadth of 30 - 45 mm, and at a supposed age of 3 - 5 years. The sexes are separate, spawning taking place in July-August. The breadth of all scallops has been measured in 5 mm groups, representative size distributions being worked out for various localities. The sizes vary from 10 to 105 mm, with the peaks at 45 - 90 mm (Fig. s 10 - 11). Distinct growth zones have been found (Fig. l) and {{on the assumption that the}} zones represent the annual growth, age distributions have been worked out (Fig. 12). In all localities there is a large number of year classes, 2 - 14 or more years, the bulk of the scallops being 8 or more years. Growth curves have also been constructed, the annual growth being estimated to 5 - 10 mm the first 7 years (Fig. 13). Later the growth decreases. Weight analyzes have also been made. Scallops of commercial size (60 mm or more) range in total weight from 30 to 130 grams, the meat weight (adductor muscle plus gonad) from 5 to 30 grams (Fig. s 14 - 15). It is supposed that the scallop beds found may support a minor commercial fishery...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the first systematic health survey of commercially exploited bivalve molluscs in Norway. The main {{aim of the}} work was to screen selected stocks of the native flat oyster Ostrea edulis and the introduced Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum {{for the presence of}} pathogenic agents. Samples were also collected from the indigenous clam Ruditapes decussatus and the scallop Pecten maximus, {{as well as from the}} introduced Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. The indigenous and cultured blue mussel Mytilus edulis and the <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallop</b> Chlamys islandica were not included. No abnormal mortalities were registered, nor were any serious pathogenic agents detected. Some tissue anomalies and some commensals or parasites were reported. These included thigmotrich ciliates on gills and in digestive diverticula, and intracytoplasmic Rickettsiales-like inclusions in epithelia of digestive gland diverticula of oysters, and a cyclopoid Modiolicola like copepod on scallop gills. Polymorphic, presumably inorganic, granulations were observed in connective tissues of oysters. Mature gonads were observed in the Manila clams. Based on the results, some advice on monitoring and management of the stocks is offered...|$|E
40|$|The {{stock index}} of the <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallop</b> (Chlamys islandica) in Breidafjordur {{on the west coast}} of Iceland has {{declined}} drastically in recent years. Total fishing mortality was very high throughout the study period from 1993 to 2003, a period characterized by a steady increase in summer sea surface temperature, in 2003 reaching the highest estimated level of the previous century. Between 1998 and 2005, estimates of chlorophyll a (food availability) fluctuated with periods of low chlorophyll followed by a reduction in muscle weight and high natural mortality. High levels of natural mortality were observed in the main fishing area {{in the southern part of}} Breidafjordur. There the stock index had been declining since 1994. Recruitment to the fishable stock was highly variable during the study period, with low recruitment towards the end of the 1990 s. Subsequently the fishery has been on relatively few year classes, and the stock has been fragile because of several years of poor recruitment and high natural mortality. Consequently, the stock appeared unable to withstand the fishing pressure and declined to historically low levels, leading to a halt to fishing in 2004...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} is developed to estimate size of <b>Iceland</b> <b>scallop</b> shells from AUV photos. A small-scale camera based AUV survey of Iceland scallops was conducted at a defined site off West Iceland. Prior to height estimation of the identified shells, the distortions introduced by the vehicle orientation and the camera lens were corrected. The average AUV pitch and roll was 1 : 3 and 2 : 3 deg that resulted in v 2 % error in ground distance rendering these effects negligible. A quadratic polynomial model was identified for lens distortion correction. This model successfully predicted a theoretical grid from a frame photographed underwater, representing the inherent lens distortion. The predicted shell heights were scaled for {{the distance from the}} bottom at which the photos were taken. This approach was validated by height estimation of scallops of known sizes. An underestimation of approximately 0 : 5 cm was seen, which could be attributed to pixel error, where each pixel represented 0 : 24 | 0 : 27 cm. After correcting for this difference the estimated heights ranged from 3 : 8 { 9 : 3 cm. A comparison of the height-distribution from a small-scale dredge survey carried out in the vicinity showed non-overlapping peaks in size distribution, with scallops of a broader size range visible in the AUV survey. Further investigations are necessary to evaluate any underlying bias and to validate how representative these surveys are of the true population. The low resolution images made identification of smaller scallops difficult. Overall, the observations of very few small scallops in both surveys could be attributed to low recruitment levels in the recent years due to the known scallop parasite outbreak i...|$|E
