Plenty of factors could be the reasons for the observed un{{even distribution}} of preservatives, such as wood products dimension, moisture content, drying process, wood extractives and structure. In this study, the influence of drying conditions, extractives and wood structure to uneven distribution of preservatives was studied. 294 Scots pine (Pinus Sylvestris) boards were treatment with copper based preservatives. The boards were kiln dried under two different drying temperatures (dry temperature was 60 and 80 °C, respectively) to three different target MC (10 - 12, 18 and 24 %). Before drying and impregnation, green and <b>dried</b> <b>test</b> <b>samples</b> (2 × 400 mm) from these boards were taken and stored in freezer at - 24 °C, respectively. The total failure ratio (boards which have failure/total boards) was 31 %. The highest failure ratio occurred in group whose drying temperature was 80 oC and MC was 13. 8 %, and the minimum failure ratio occurred group whose drying temperature was 80 oC and MC was 20. 2 %. Quantitative analysis of extractives on matched impregnated and umimpregnated areas of dried and green samples were done by GC-FID. The microstructure of wood on the areas with impregnation failures was also studied by SEM. The results showed that fatty acids, resin acids and fats could {{play an important role in}} explaining uneven distribution of preservatives. The areas with impregnation failures contained more fatty acids, resin acids and fats than impregnated areas on dried samples. Those extractives could block resin canal as well as parenchyma cells which will hinder liquid penetration. Also, the drying process has an influence to presence of fatty acids, resin acids and fats, which could well explain the impregnation failure ratio of the whole batch. In addition, the influence of reconditioning to uneven distribution of preservatives was investigated with the help of CT-scanner. However, the results showed that the influence of reconditioning to impregnation results was not obvious. Validerat; 20120615 (anonymous...|$|R

40|$|There are inefficiencies {{in current}} {{approaches}} to monitoring patients on antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa. Patients typically attend clinics every 1 to 3 months for clinical assessment. The clinic costs are comparable with {{the costs of}} the drugs themselves and CD 4 counts are measured every 6 months, but patients are rarely switched to second-line therapies. To ensure sustainability of treatment programmes, a transition to more cost-effective delivery of antiretroviral therapy is needed. In contrast to the CD 4 count, measurement of the level of HIV RNA in plasma (the viral load) provides a direct measure of the current treatment effect. Viral-load-informed differentiated care is a means of tailoring care so that those with suppressed viral load visit the clinic less frequently and attention is focussed on those with unsuppressed viral load to promote adherence and timely switching to a second-line regimen. The most feasible approach to measuring viral load in many countries is to collect dried blood spot <b>samples</b> for <b>testing</b> in regional laboratories; however, there have been concerns over the sensitivity and specificity of this approach to define treatment failure and the delay in returning results to the clinic.
