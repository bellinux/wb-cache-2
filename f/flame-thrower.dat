5|$|The {{need for}} tanks to equip {{armoured}} units led the War Cabinet {{to approve the}} manufacture of the Sentinel tank in 1940. Some 66 of them were delivered by the time manufacture ceased in July 1943, but none were used in action. Otherwise tanks were sourced from overseas. A quantity of M3 Stuart light tanks were received in September 1941, while the first shipment of British Matilda II tanks arrived in July 1942, and these {{proved to be the}} most suitable type for jungle warfare. A <b>flame-thrower</b> variant was produced and eventually saw action in the Borneo campaign. The most numerous tank used by the Australian Army was the M3 Lee. Several hundred of these equipped the armoured divisions, but unlike the Stuarts and Matildas, they did not see action. An Australian scout car known as the Dingo was produced as an interim measure until adequate supplies of the Canadian Staghound armoured car became available in 1944. The Australian Army also operated some amphibious tractors.|$|E

25|$|Ob'yekt 483 - <b>Flame-thrower</b> tank prototype, {{based on}} the T-54B. This version {{featured}} installation of the ATO-1 <b>flame-thrower</b> in short stubby barrel with internal tube instead of the main gun, resulting in a decrease of the tank's firepower. There's also a circular vertical vent on the rear of turret and a sight mount level with top of mantlet aperture. Following trials with the prototype vehicle, development work on this ceased.|$|E
25|$|TO-55 (OT-55, Ob'yekt 482) - This <b>flame-thrower</b> {{version of}} the T-55 tank {{incorporates}} the ATO-200 flame projector. The flame thrower is ignited by pyrotechnic charges, and 12 charges are the basic load. The stowage tank, which replaces the hull ammunition rack besides the driver, contains 460-litres of flammable liquid, and each burst averages 36 liters. The maximum effective range {{of the system is}} 200 meters, with the stream having an initial muzzle velocity of about 100 mps.|$|E
25|$|Armoured {{support was}} {{provided}} by the 14th Army Tank Regiment (The Calgary Regiment (Tank)) with 58 of the new Churchill tanks, to be delivered using the new landing craft tank (LCT). The tanks had a mixture of armament with QF 2 pounder gun–armed tanks fitted with a close support howitzer in the hull operating alongside QF 6 pounder–armed tanks. In addition, three of the Churchills were equipped with <b>flame-thrower</b> equipment and all had adaptations enabling them to operate in the shallow water near the beach.|$|E

500|$|Dunstan {{subsequently}} {{directed the}} clearance of the bunker system {{that had been}} located the previous day, and a combined force of D Company, 1 RAR and 1 Troop C Squadron {{under the command of}} Major Tony Hammett was tasked with carrying out a reconnaissance-in-force. Departing at 06:00 {{on the morning of the}} 26 May, the lead Australian infantry platoon was contacted at 12:27 by small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades [...] from Coral, after having paused to direct an air strike by Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron RAAF onto a nearby bunker system. In what would become the first Australian combined infantry and tank assault since the Bougainville campaign against the Japanese in the Second World War, the tanks were called forward and attacked the bunkers with anti-tank solid shot and machine-guns, while the infantry indicated targets with their M79 grenade launchers. Moving forward two or three abreast, the Centurions crushed many of the bunkers with their tracks and engaged others at point-blank range with their main armament. Further bunkers were exposed when the foliage was cut away by canister rounds and the infantry followed the tanks using rifles and grenades, while assault pioneers provided support with a <b>flame-thrower</b> as artillery and mortar fire engaged depth targets.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the east}} end of the wood, Fusilier Regiment 35 {{attacked}} with the support of <b>flame-thrower</b> detachments but the mud was so bad that six became unusable, the artillery preparation was inadequate and the first two attacks failed. The third attempt, after a more extensive bombardment, was called [...] "a wonderful victory". The attack from the north came from three companies of Infantry Regiment 88 and Stormtroops either side of Tea Lane. British return fire caused many casualties and forced the attackers to move from shell-hole to shell-hole, eventually being pinned down in no man's land. The survivors withdrew after dark, rallying at Flers. I Battalion, Bavarian Infantry Regiment 5, with a company of [...] Battalion 3, attached <b>flame-thrower</b> and bombing detachments, attacked eastwards towards the 56th Division, along Tea and Orchard trenches, where a bomber killed a British machine-gun crew, by throwing a grenade [...] A second artillery bombardment was fired at [...] and the [...] managed to take [...] and gain a foothold.

5000|$|Geilenkirchen {{itself was}} subdued {{relatively}} easily by the 333rd Infantry Regiment on 19 November, but the Allied advance {{suffered from the}} lack of artillery support which had been held back by the fear of friendly fire incidents, as had occurred earlier in the British sector. Two troops of tanks from the British Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry provided close support, although they could not make up entirely for lack of artillery. From Geilenkirchen, the advance continued northeast along the Wurm toward Süggerath. Flame-throwing Crocodiles subdued the increasing German resistance, especially two pillboxes guarding the road into Süggerath. [...] "A few squirts from the <b>flame-throwers,</b> and the Germans poured out ... The bastards are afraid of those <b>flame-throwers</b> and won’t be caught inside a pillbox ...", said one U.S. company commander.|$|R
50|$|In {{the woods}} {{to the west of}} Oosterbeek the 4th Parachute Brigade fought its way towards the divisional {{perimeter}} but was attacked by German troops supported by artillery, mortars and tanks, (some mounting <b>flame-throwers).</b> The brigade had many casualties and the 10th Battalion reached Oosterbeek in the early afternoon with only 60 men.|$|R

2500|$|On 2 June, {{a bigger}} German attack began after an {{intensive}} bombardment of the French front, {{from the north}} of Laffaux {{to the east of}} Berry-au-Bac. On the night of [...] two German divisions made five attacks on the east, west and central parts of the Californie Plateau and the west end of the Vauclerc Plateau. The Germans attacked in waves, sometimes advancing shoulder-to-shoulder, supported by <b>flame-thrower</b> detachments. Some ground was gained on the Vauclerc Plateau, until French counter-attacks recovered the ground. Despite the French holding improvised defences and the huge volume of German artillery-fire used to prepare attacks, the German organised counter-attacks (...) met with little success and at Chevreux north-east of Craonne, the French advanced further into the Laon Plain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{garrison}} was stalked {{through the}} ruins and quickly overrun.

Other Zouave battalions on the flanks came up and the 38th Division halted and helped to consolidate the summit of the plateau, which had come under bombardment by German artillery on the Monampteuil Heights to the east. At [...] the divisions of XXI Corps descended the northern slopes towards Vaudesson, Bois de la Belle Croix, Montparnasse Quarry, Bois des Hoinets and the west end of Chavignon village. The 38th Division of XI Corps conformed and advanced on its objectives at Bois de Garenne and Orme Farm, between Fort de la Malmaison and the east end Chavignon. The road from Pargny-Filain to Chavignon was to be crossed to reach the objective at Many Farm to the east.|$|E

The 7th Brigade relieved the 10th Cheshire with the 8th Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment for another attack on 10 October to take the Mounds. The Germans counter-attacked again on 11 October and during the evening of 12 October, a German counter-attack by a Stoßtrupp supported by a <b>flame-thrower</b> detachment, managed to re-capture the north-west corner of Stuff Redoubt but was then forced out with many casualties; 13 October was quiet.|$|E
2500|$|In late January 1916, French {{intelligence}} {{had obtained}} an accurate assessment of German military capacity and intentions at Verdun but Joffre considered that an attack {{would be a}} diversion, {{because of the lack}} of an obvious strategic objective. By the time of the German offensive, Joffre expected a bigger attack elsewhere but ordered the VII Corps to Verdun on 23 January, to hold the north face of the west bank. XXX Corps held the salient east of the Meuse to the north and north-east and II Corps held the eastern face of the Meuse Heights; Herr had [...] divisions in the front line, with [...] divisions in close reserve.

2500|$|The Tenth Army {{had failed}} to advance on the {{northern}} flank against Barleux in the Sixth Army area, where the XXXIII Corps {{on both sides of}} the Somme, had attacked again in the south on 18 October, to counter German mining and improve the line from La Maisonnette north to Biaches. An attack to clear the approaches to the higher ground on which lay Villers-Carbonnel and Fresnes to the south-east was forestalled on 29 October, when the Germans bombarded La Maisonette for eight hours with high explosive, gas and lacrymatory shell and then the 206th Division attacked with Infantry Regiment 359. A battalion of the 97th Infantry Regiment was overrun and [...] taken, which left a gap in the French line for several days and the attack on Barleux had to be cancelled. On the right (southern) flank of the army, the 51st Division was unable to advance further in Bois 4 on 11 October.

50|$|Sasamoto's team {{then moved}} to Valencia, Spain where they visited a {{fireworks}} factory and built and tested a full-scale Prometeo prototype. It was {{at this stage of}} development that the <b>flame-throwers</b> were calibrated and the firework launchers were tested. After completing testing, Sasamoto returned to Japan and oversaw construction of the show-use Prometeo, which was manufactured by a firm specializing in precision machinery. After manufacturing, the show-use Prometeo was tested for 2 months in water conditions and installed in a 6-meter deep pit, which was constructed in the Mediterranean Harbor lagoon. The crucial difficulties worked out at this stage were ensuring that the electronics, <b>flame-throwers,</b> and fireworks could function even when underwater. Corsini also traveled to Japan, where he spent 1 month working out the lighting with the Japanese staff. Due to the park remaining open during this time, testing the light and water controls, as well as training the crew to use them, was conducted after the park closed each night at 11 pm. The size of the show-use Prometeo was 14 meters tall and 32 meters wide; the show-use Bellisea was 11 meters tall. The final development and production cost of BraviSEAmo! was 3 billion yen (nearly $37 million in 2011 dollars).|$|R

An ultimatum calling for prompt surrender was delivered by loud speakers and the northern fort's garrison marched out to surrender to the HLI shortly before the ultimatum's deadline expired. This left the southern fort, where General Heim was quartered and which continued firing. Armour, including <b>flame-throwers,</b> was brought forward and the German garrison destroyed their guns; a cease-fire came into force at 4:17pm.

What followed were a series of short stories and plays in which Arlt pursued his vision of bizarre, half-mad, alienated characters pursuing insane quests in a landscape of urban chaos. In 1932 he published El amor brujo.|$|R
