40|$|Background and Purpose: Loco-regional {{radiotherapy}} after breast conserving surgery significantly {{reduces the}} risk of recurrence but may induce complications in the lungs. The complications are related to the lung volume irradiated and the lung dose delivered. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate three tangential breast irradiation techniques i. e. conventional technique, gantry tilting technique and <b>half-beam</b> block technique in terms of the percentage of irradiated lung volume and high dose lung volume for patients of different sizes. Materials and Method: Treatment planning of the three tangential breast irradiation techniques was performed using the CT scans of 20 patients with early-stage breast cancer after lumpectomy. Results: When compared with conventional technique, both half beam block technique and gantry tilting technique irradiated a significantly smaller percentage of lung volume and delivered a smaller percentage of high dose (above 30 Gy) volume in the lung. Patients with large breasts had a significantly higher percentage of lung volume irradiated to above 30 Gy than those patients with small and medium breasts. The combined effect of tangential separation and technique only produced significant effect on the percentage of total lung volume irradiated but not on the high dose volume. Conclusions: Gantry tilting and <b>half-beam</b> block techniques can reduce a significant amount of lung volume and high dose lung volume. <b>Half-beam</b> block technique is recommended for small and medium breast size while for large breast size, gantry tilting technique is preferred.

40|$|Purpose: To {{present a}} {{practical}} method for calibrating the zero position of asymmetric jaws that provides higher accuracy {{at the central}} axis and improves dose homogeneity in the abutting region of <b>half-beams.</b> Methods: Junction doses were measured for each asymmetric jaw using the double-exposure technique and electronic portal imaging devices. The junction dose was determined {{as a function of}} jaw position. The shift in the zero jaw position (or in its corresponding potentiometer readout) required to correct for the measured junction dose could thus be obtained. The jaw calibration was then modified to introduce the calculated shift and therefore achieve an accurate zero position in order to provide a relative junction dose that was as close to zero as possible. Results: All the asymmetric jaws from four medical linear accelerators were calibrated with the new calibration procedure. Measured relative junction doses at gantry 0 ° were reduced from a maximum of ± 40 % to a maximum of ± 8 % for all the jaws in the four considered accelerators. These results were valid for 6 MV and 18 MV photon beams and for any combination of asymmetric jaws set to zero. The calibration was stable {{over a long period of}} time; therefore, the need for recalibrating is seldom necessary. Conclusions: Accurate calibration of the zero position of the jaws is feasible in current medical linear accelerators. The proposed procedure is fast and it improves dose homogeneity at the junction of <b>half-beams,</b> thus, allowing a more accurate and safer use of these techniques. © 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

The LSI is an attractive interferometric test technique because of its simple configuration, but it suffers from the so-called 'duplicate image’ problem, which originates from the interference of two sheared object beams. In order to overcome this problem, a modified LSI system, which employs a new concept of subdivided two-beam interference (STBI), is proposed. In this proposed method, an object beam passing through a target object is controlled and divided into two areas with and without object information, which are called half-object and half-reference beams, respectively. Then, these two <b>half-beams</b> make an interference pattern just like most two-beam interferometers.

Furthermore, no phase shift between half-beams is incurred as long as the planes containing a grating line and the surface normal for each grating of the pair are parallel. For grating pairs satisfying this condition, gratings surfaces need not be on the same plane, as changes in the gap between the two can compensate to bring the beams back in phase. © 2008 Optical Society of America...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{quantify}} the dosimetric impact of interfractional shoulder motion on {{targets in the}} low neck for head and neck patients treated with volume modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Methods : Three patients with head and neck cancer were selected. All three required treatment to nodal regions in the low neck {{in addition to the}} primary tumor site. The patients were immobilized during simulation and treatment with a custom thermoplastic mask covering the head and shoulders. One VMAT plan was created for each patient utilizing two full 360 ° arcs and a second plan was created consisting of two superior VMAT arcs matched to an inferior static AP supraclavicular field. A CT-on-rails alignment verification was performed weekly during each patient’s treatment course. The weekly CT images were registered to the simulation CT and the target contours were deformed and applied to the weekly CT. The two VMAT plans were copied to the weekly CT datasets and recalculated to obtain the dose to the deformed low neck contours. Results: The average observed shoulder position shift in any single dimension relative to simulation was 2. 5 mm. The maximum shoulder shift observed in a single dimension was 25. 7 mm. Low neck target mean doses, normalized to simulation and averaged across all weekly recalculations were 0. 996, 0. 991, and 1. 033 (Full VMAT plan) and 0. 986, 0. 995, and 0. 990 (<b>Half-Beam</b> VMAT plan) for the three patients, respectively. The maximum observed deviation in target mean dose for any individual weekly recalculation was 6. 5 %, occurring with the Full VMAT plan for Patient 3. Conclusion : Interfractional variation in dose to low neck nodal regions was quantified for three head and neck patients treated with VMAT. Mean dose was 3. 3 % higher than planned for one patient using a Full VMAT plan. A <b>Half-Beam</b> technique is likely a safer choice when treating the supraclavicular region with VMAT.

For three-dimensional (3 -D) optimization of the dose distribution using serial CT scan images, suitable volumes have to be delineated. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a computer-generated delineation of a plan optimization volume (POV) and an irradiated volume (IV) and to automate their use in a fast dose homogeneity optimization engine. Patients and Methods: Simulation was performed according to our standard procedure which involves the positioning of a lead collar around the palpable breast to facilitate the definition of gantry angle, collimator angle and field aperture for tangential wedged photon beams. In a change to the standard procedure an anterolateral radiograph was taken with its axis orthogonal to the central plane of the two tangential <b>half-beams.</b> Images from a serial CT scan were acquired in treatment position, and the geometric data of the three simulated beams were used by a computer program to generate the POV and IV. For each patient, weights of wedged and unwedged beams were optimized by either human heuristics using only the central slice (2 -D), the whole set of CT slices (3 -D), or by a computer algorithm using the POV, IV and Lung volume with constrained matrix inversion (CMI) as optimization method. The resulting dose distributions were compared. Results: The total planning procedure took, on average, 44 min of which < 7 min were needed for human interactions, compared to about 52 min for the standard planning at Ghent University Hospital, Belgium. The simulation time is increased by 2 - 3 min. The method provides 3 -D information of the dose distribution. Dose homogeneity and minimum dose inside the POV and maximum dose inside the IV were not significantly different for the three optimization techniques.

40|$|Introduction: Single {{isocentre}} <b>half-beam</b> block (HBB) technique {{permits the}} avoidance of hot and cold spots. This technique is very useful in sparing the underlying ipsilateral lung and heart, if the left breast is treated. The major advantage of this technique is that it facilitates the complete sparing of both contralateral breast and lung. Regarding this, the present study aimed to analyse the dosimetric results obtained from the HBB technique {{in the treatment of}} breast cancer using three different algorithms. Materials and Methods: For the purpose of the study, a total dose of 5000 cGy was prescribed to the planning target volume (PTV) in 25 fractions per fraction daily, five days a week. The PTV was derived by using 4 - 7 mm isotropic expansion of the clinical target volume (CTV) clipping 1 - 3 mm from the patient’s surface in the breast-conserving cases. Three plans were created for each patient using three different algorithms, including convolution, fast superposition, and superposition with the same parameters. Results: The mean doses of PTV-breast and CTV-supraclavicular fossa (SCF) were tabulated and analysed. In the PTV-breast, the maximum and minimum mean doses were 5428. 8 and 4930. 2 cGy, which were observed in the fast superposition and convolution algorithms, respectively. In the CTV-SCF, the maximum and minimum mean doses were 5428. 8 and 5126. 8 cGy, respectively, detected in only fast superposition algorithm. Conclusion: As the findings of the present study indicated, the convolution algorithm gives slightly better dosimetric results in breast cancer treatment, compared to the fast superposition and superposition algorithms. Therefore, it is prudent to apply the HBB technique with convolution algorithm using the Elekta XiO planning system in the treatment of breast cancer  including supraclavicular lymph node metastasis...|$|E

The radial distributions of 12 CO and 13 CO in NGC 3627, NGC 3628, and M 51 can be well fitted by an exponential profile. The 12 CO/ 13 CO intensity ratio,R,decreases monotonically with galactocentric radius in all mapped sources. The average R {{in the center and}} disk of the galaxies are 9. 9 +/- 3. 0 and 5. 6 +/- 1. 9 respectively, much lower than the peculiar R(~ 24) found in the center of M 82. The intensity ratios of 13 CO/C 18 O, 13 CO/HCO+ and 13 CO/CS (either ours or literature data) show little variations with galactocentric radius, in sharp contrast with the greatly varied R. This supports the notion that the observed gradient in R could be the results of the variations of the physical conditions across the disks. The H_ 2 column density derived from C 18 O shows that the Galactic standard conversion factor (X-factor) overestimates the amount of the molecular gas in M 82 by a factor of ~ 2. 5. These observations suggest that the X-factor in active star-forming regions (i. e., nuclear regions) should be lower than that in normal star-forming disks, and the gradient in R can be used to trace the variations of the X-factor.
