5000|$|... α-Amylase {{activity}} in grain is measured by, for instance, the Hagberg-Perten <b>Falling</b> <b>Number,</b> {{a test to}} assess sprout damages, or the Phadebas method.|$|E
50|$|After 60 {{seconds of}} mixing, the stirrer is {{dropped from the}} top of the test tube, and the {{operator}} measures the time it takes for the stirrer to reach the bottom. That time, measured in seconds, is the <b>Falling</b> <b>Number.</b> When the stirrer is dropped, its speed and thus the time it takes it to fall to the bottom, will be determined by the viscosity of the slurry. In other words, the more sprouted the grain was the higher the alpha-amylase activity will be. The higher the alpha-amylase activity the lower the viscosity of the slurry. The lower the viscosity of the slurry the faster the stirrer will fall to the bottom. That is why more sprouted grain results in a lower <b>Falling</b> <b>Number</b> as <b>Falling</b> <b>Number</b> is the time it takes the stirrer to fall to the bottom.|$|E
5000|$|Sprout {{damage is}} {{undesirable}} germination of wheat kernels that occurs on mature, unharvested wheat when wet field conditions persist {{just prior to}} and during the harvest. Mature wheat that has been cut and left lying in the field prior to threshing is particularly vulnerable to sprout damage. Early cold weather in Canada often forces wheat producers there to cut and windrow their crop to allow for drying. Wet conditions can then cause widespread sprout damage. If it has occurred, there is a dramatic increase of the enzyme alpha-amylase. The <b>Falling</b> <b>Number</b> test {{is a measure of}} the presence of this enzyme. A high <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> indicates that the wheat is sound and satisfactory for most baking processes. A low <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> indicates that harmful sprouting has occurred and is suggestive of reduced baking quality. In bread, too much alpha-amylase activity will cause wet sticky bread crumb with large voids in the loaf and too little causes dry crumble bread crumb and high loaf density.|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s {{the school}} had {{financial}} difficulties due to <b>falling</b> <b>numbers</b> of pupils, and was placed into receivership in 1997.|$|R
50|$|East Tisted had {{a primary}} school, also serving {{some of the}} {{surrounding}} villages, until its closure in 1981 due to <b>falling</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Matt Serafini of Dread Central ranked Cherry <b>Falls</b> <b>number</b> {{seven in}} {{a list of}} the top ten high school horror films from 1996 to the present.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Falling</b> <b>Number</b> {{method was}} {{developed}} {{at the end of}} the 1950s by Sven Hagberg and his co-worker Harald Perten, both at the Cereal Laboratory of the Swedish Institute for the Crafts and Industries.|$|E
50|$|Quality Control lab: IFS {{maintains}} a quality control laboratory with modern {{equipment such as}} Ferinograph, Amylograph, IR-Protein Analyzer, <b>Falling</b> <b>number</b> apparatus and Alveograph which are used for high precision analysis of foodgrains. This maboratory {{is one of the}} most modern among FCI laboratories.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Falling</b> <b>Number</b> {{method is}} uncomplicated, but {{requires}} an apparatus which follows the international standards. Such an apparatus {{consists of a}} water bath, a test tube, a stirring rod, and a stirring device. The test was performed manually when first employed, test instrumentation today is mostly automated.|$|E
50|$|Glenough National School was {{permanently}} {{closed in}} the 1980s due to <b>falling</b> <b>numbers,</b> and since then children from Glenough have attended primary school at Rossmore National School.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013 the {{decision}} was made by council officials that the school should shut because of <b>falling</b> <b>numbers.</b> After 153 years the school closed in June 2013.|$|R
50|$|The gengorō-buna {{is being}} used as a {{substitute}} for the depleted stock of nigoro-buna in the preparation of the intense-smelling fermented local dish (funazushi) due to the nigoro-bunas <b>falling</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Due to the <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> of competitors, {{the tournament}} {{was reduced to}} one week in 2010. The men's fours and triples along with the ladies' triples were {{discontinued}} and a mixed triples was introduced which is vied for along with the men's singles and pairs and the ladies' singles and pairs.|$|E
50|$|In retrospect, the SROP underestimated {{urban density}} {{and failed to}} {{anticipate}} the <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> of people per household, meaning that the footprint earmarked for five million people by 2000 ended up accommodating only four million. While Chatswood and Parramatta developed into fully-fledged city centres, Campbelltown did not attract {{the same degree of}} commercial growth.|$|E
5000|$|The union later {{joined the}} Miners' Federation of Great Britain, and from 1894 until 1904, it {{participated in the}} loose South Western Counties Miners’ Federation with the Bristol Miners' Association and the Somerset Miners' Association. [...] In 1940, faced with <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> of miners in the district, it merged into the South Wales Miners Federation.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} Albert Dock {{and others in}} the {{immediate}} vicinity, Canning Dock was abandoned as a commercial shipping facility in 1972 due to the rising cost of dredging and <b>falling</b> <b>numbers</b> in traffic.|$|R
50|$|A small National School {{was built}} c. 1850-2 and was {{attended}} by 40-50 children in 1858. Owing to <b>falling</b> <b>numbers,</b> the school closed in 1922 but reopened in 1930; it was finally closed in 1966.|$|R
5000|$|Switching Schools: Due to <b>falling</b> <b>numbers,</b> Brompton School {{merges with}} its rival, Hanson High. But the old enmity is dying hard and the Hanson High pupils {{are not being}} {{friendly}} to the former Brompton pupils.|$|R
50|$|Furness Academy {{was formed}} after a public {{consultation}} by Cumbria County Council following {{concerns over the}} <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> of pupils, educational standards and performance and out-of-date school facilities in the town. The decision was then made to establish an Academy to replace Alfred Barrow School, Parkview Community College of Technology and Thorncliffe School. The academy's sponsor is BAE Systems.|$|E
50|$|The school {{closed because}} of the <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> of boys, lack of trained staff, and {{reorganisation}} and rationalisation led to the closure which had been discussed {{for a number of}} years. A fire that occurred a few months before the closure destroyed {{a large part of the}} building, but it was not the reason for closure.|$|E
5000|$|Ysgol Rhydyclafdy School was {{the only}} primary school in the {{community}} and closed in 2008 due to a <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> in pupils and as part of a programme that saw two additional schools being closed on the Llŷn Peninsula. Gwynedd Council allowed the building to be reopened as a nursery with community facilities two years later.|$|E
50|$|In 2011 Hookergate School in High Spen {{was closed}} due to <b>falling</b> <b>numbers,</b> and merged with Ryton Comprehensive. The Hookergate site {{remained}} {{open for the}} academic year 2011-12 to provide education for years 8, 9 and 11.|$|R
50|$|The Chief Scout's Advance Party Report was a {{publication}} produced in 1966 by The Boy Scout Association in the United Kingdom, intended to modernise the Scout Movement. The report {{was attempting to}} address <b>falling</b> <b>numbers</b> within the Movement.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, Felix {{started to}} operate holiday tours, {{both in the}} UK and abroad. Due to <b>falling</b> <b>numbers</b> of passengers, the holiday tours were to be stopped, but popular demand saw a limited number operate in 2008.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, the FAO {{listed the}} {{conservation}} {{status of the}} Maronesa as [...] "not at risk". At the end of 2016 there were 4777 breeding cows registered in the herd-book; the total population was estimated at 8300-9900. Threats to the Maronesa include the <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> of keepers of the breed, their increasing mean age, {{and changes in the}} tax regulations.|$|E
5000|$|The Falling Number(FN), also {{referred}} to as the Hagberg Number, Method is the internationally standardized (ICC 107/1, ISO 3093-2004, AACC 56-81B) and most popular method for determining sprout damage. With the <b>Falling</b> <b>Number</b> test, so-called weather or sprout damaged wheat or rye, which is disastrous for bread making quality, could be detected at the grain silo intake within a few minutes.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the high}} {{expenses}} of administering the SAT test, {{the cost of the}} weekly room rentals, and the <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> of participating schools in the county, MCMPYP is heading towards its end. The freshman students enrolled in MCMPYP during the 2007-2008 class session will be able to continue their education with MCMPYP into year 2008-2009 as they head into their sophomore year. However, new freshman students in the year 2008-2009 {{will not be able to}} enroll into the program.|$|E
50|$|In 1989 due to <b>falling</b> <b>numbers</b> of parishioners {{the church}} of St Michael and John was deconsecrated. It was then redeveloped (part of the Temple Bar {{rejuvenation}} scheme) into the 'Viking Adventure' which was closed down in 2002.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, a {{secondary}} girls school was established at Mount Carmel {{and continued to}} operate until 1992 when it was closed due to the <b>falling</b> <b>numbers</b> of school-aged children in the area. The Guardian Angels primary school remains operational.|$|R
50|$|The prison {{featured}} a small hospital, workshops and a Protestant church. Around 110 people worked there, mostly German {{refugees from the}} eastern territories lost after WW II. In 1952, the prison was dissolved due to <b>falling</b> <b>numbers</b> of incarcerated.|$|R
50|$|Whereas the Cumberland Plan {{had failed}} to {{anticipate}} high growth, the SROP underestimated urban density: the <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> of people per household. (The footprint earmarked for five million people by 2000 ended up accommodating only four million.) Carr's plan championed {{a new approach to}} urban design, characterised by infill development, smaller lots, smaller street frontages, narrower roads and a 20 per cent multi-unit dwelling target. In doing so it represented an early salvo in a debate between local councils and state agencies about development densities that continues to this day.|$|E
5000|$|Breton {{literature}} {{since the}} 1920s has been lively, despite the <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> of speakers. In 1925, Roparz Hemon founded the periodical Gwalarn which for 19 years {{tried to raise}} the language {{to the level of}} other great [...] "international" [...] languages by creating original works covering all genres and by proposing Breton translations of internationally recognized foreign works. In 1946, Al Liamm took up the role of Gwalam. Other reviews came into existence and gave Breton a fairly large body of literature for a minority language. Among writers in Breton are Yann-Ber Kalloc'h, Anjela Duval and Per-Jakez Hélias.|$|E
50|$|The hotel {{failed to}} prosper and the {{building}} was purchased by David Davies MP in 1906 and {{was presented to the}} Calvinistic Methodist Connexion as a residential theological college, at a total cost of about £30,000. The professors and students of Trevecca College in Breconshire were transferred to the new college in 1906. In 1910 there were about 30 students. Later, because of the <b>falling</b> <b>number</b> of students training for the ministry, the college opened its doors to students wanting to take a theology degree as an academic subject alone. Degrees offered included Bachelor of Divinity (BD) and Master of Theology (MTh).|$|E
50|$|St. Catherine's Church of Ireland on Mill Road, {{was built}} in 1775 but closed in the 1960s due to <b>falling</b> <b>numbers</b> of parishioners. The nearest Anglican church is St. Mary's, Fountains, 7 km east in the townland of Kilanthony.|$|R
50|$|Due {{partially}} to <b>falling</b> <b>numbers</b> not {{all have}} been recognised as Australian Champions, some only as national series winners. For example in 2009 only the 250 International class was recognised with the status of Australian champion. Numbers have since rebounded.|$|R
50|$|St. Trea's Primary School is {{attended}} by {{people from the}} Ballymaguigan side of the parish. In 2003 the North Eastern Education and Library Board tried to merge the two primary schools together due to <b>falling</b> <b>numbers</b> at St. Trea's Primary School.|$|R
