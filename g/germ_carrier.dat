40|$|Antiparasitic {{disinfection}} manifests unjustifiable deficiencies to date (Hiepe, 2010). Though DVG guidelines specify {{methods for}} testing disinfectants on protozoa and helminths in the veterinary medical parasitary field, however, test procedures on malignant arthropods are not included. In this work, M. domestica {{was selected for}} {{the investigation of the}} disin-fectant efficacy test for surface disinfection being a potential representative of malignant arthropods, Victor (1999) and Mielke et al. (2001) had conducted preliminary investigations on M. domestica using a registered cresol-based test preparation. The aim of my own investigations was to test the suitability of this species as an indicator organism. For this purpose, initially M. domestica were bred. All M. domestica developmental stages (eggs, larvae I, larvae II, larvae III, pupae, imagines) were included in both, the procedural execution and the efficacy tests. After presenting an analysis of the publications on disinfection and M. domestica, the breeding of the housefly and the execution of the developed test procedures were described in detail. The efficacy tests were carried out using two different test preparations with different active substances. Test preparation 1 (active substances: o-hydroxydiphenyl-fatty acid-eutectic, peracetic acid) is found in the 13 th list of disinfectants by DVG (N. N., 2011 / 1) (Spectrum of efficacy: bactericidal, tuberculocidal, fungicidal, virucidal, antiparasitary (worm eggs, coccidia)). Test preparation 2 (Active substances: glutaraldehyde, glyoxal, formaldehyde, benzalkonium-chloride, didecyl-dimethylammonium-chloride) is not listed by DVG, but by DGHM and by RKI (Spectrum of efficacy: bactericidal, tuberculocidal, sporicidal, fungicidal, virus inactivating). The disinfectant efficacy tests were performed at every M. domestica stage in the suspension test and the <b>germ</b> <b>carrier</b> test as well; only the adult house flies were exclusively examined in the suspension test. The <b>germ</b> <b>carrier</b> tests were performed with two different materials – poplar and the back side of tiles. The test procedures and the germ carriers used both proved to be suited for the disinfectant testing. However, the time and labour required for examining certain developmental stages of M. domestica were adversely affected by their ability to move. As expected, M. domestica exhibited different susceptibilities to the tested active agents at the different stages of their development. It could be proven that M. domestica -eggs is the only developmental stage that did not meet the requirements by DVG (N. N., 2007) specified for A. suum - eggs in comparison, neither in the suspension tests nor in the <b>germ</b> <b>carrier</b> tests of the two test preparations. Thus the M. domestica - egg exhibited the lowest overall susceptibility to the two test preparations (table 1. 1 - 1. 3, table 2. 1 - 2. 3). The test procedures on M. domestica - eggs and - pupae are recommended as suitable. The consideration of tenacity as well as the execution of the test procedures resulted in this finding. Efficacy tests on holometabolous malignant arthropods should be performed in 2 steps. Step 1 : Test on pupae, step 2 : Test on eggs, whereas step 2 should only be performed, if step 1 brought positive findings. The test on heterometabolous insects is only recommended at one developmental stage, the egg. Considering the lower overall efficacy obtained, the material property and seen from an ecological and economic perspective the <b>germ</b> <b>carrier</b> poplar is to be preferred to the back side of tiles. The established breeding of M. domestica {{plays a major role in}} deciding for an indicator organism of malignant arthropods. Own investigations show that the cosmopolite M. domestica is suited as an indicator for disinfectant efficacy tests on malignant arthropods (specifically eggs and pupae of holometabola) in the suspension test and in the <b>germ</b> <b>carrier</b> test as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{persistence}} of 3 low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) (H 4 N 6, H 5 N 1, and H 6 N 8) and one human influenza virus (H 1 N 1) {{as well as}} Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and enteric cytopathogenic bovine orphan (ECBO) virus was investigated in lake sediment, duck feces, and duck meat at 30, 20, 10, and 0 °C using a <b>germ</b> <b>carrier</b> technique. Virus-loaded germ carriers were incubated in each substrate, and residual infectivity of the eluted virus was quantified on cell culture after regular intervals for a maximum of 24 weeks. Data were analyzed by a linear regression model to calculate T 90 values (time required for 90 % loss of virus infectivity) and estimated {{persistence of}} the viruses. In general, the persistence {{of all of the}} viruses was highest in lake sediment, followed by feces, and was the lowest in duck meat at all temperatures. For the avian influenza virus subtypes, T 90 values in sediment ranged from 5 to 11, 13 to 18, 43 to 54, and 66 to 394 days at 30, 20, 10, and 0 °C, respectively, which were 2 to 5 times higher than the T 90 values of the viruses in the feces and meat. Although the individual viruses vary in tenacity, the survival time of influenza viruses was shorter than that of NDV and ECBO virus in all substrates. The {{results of this study suggest}} that lake sediment may act as a long-term source of influenza viruses in the aquatic habitat, while the viruses may remain infectious for extended periods of time in duck feces and meat at low temperatures, allowing persistence of the viruses in the environment over winter...|$|E
40|$|Disinfection is an {{indispensable}} {{component in the}} strategic control of parasites. In the Disinfectant Efficacy Testing, regarding parasitic field, only protozoa and helminths are considered to the DVG-guidelines (2000, 2007; from 2015 DVG-testing guidelines). Musca domestica {{can be used as}} an indicator in testing methods against harmful arthropods (Victor, 1999; Mielke et al, 2001; Simmet, 2013; Al Halbouni and Hiepe, 2015; Hiepe et al., 2015). The wide spectrum of arthropods species requires a representative for Acari as Parasites indicator, in addition to M. domestica as representative for insects. After extensive preliminary examinations, it has been found that Dermanyssus gallinae is suitable to be this indicator. That is because D. gallinae is able to represent harmful arthropod spectrum as an infectious agent as well as a vector. The problem of the low reproductive rate of these parasites (average 4 - 7 eggs / female / week) has been solved by the biostatistical method "one-sample t-test". By Using D. gallinae laboratory strain H- 0 another two problems have been solved: the exclusion of potential drug resistance of field strains and ensuring a stable D. gallinae- reproduction rate by the in vivo feeding. After intensive literature studies about disinfectant problems, with special consideration of antiparasitic disinfectants, a many examinations on chemical disinfectant efficacy testing, three produkts with different active ingredients groups have been selected: - Neopredisan 135 - 1; ingredient: p-chloro-m-cresol - Ascarosteril AB; ingredients in Component A: o -Hydroxydiphenyl fatty acid eutectic and in component B: peracetic acid. - Preventol VET 100; ingredients: 4 -chloro- 3 -methyl phenol, 2 -benzyl- 4 -chlorophenol, biphenyl- 2 -ol By Neopredisan 135 - 1 and Ascarosteril AB all D. gallinae-developmental stages (eggs, larvae, nymphs I and II) as well as hungry and full soaked adults have been included in the disinfectant efficacy testing. The examination of Preventol VET 100 was carried out exclusively on eggs of D. gallinae and soaked adults, as {{there were no significant differences}} in efficacy within the different stages of the parasite. The methodical equipment has been proved scientifically and technically through further development of germ carriers using poplar wood and concrete, and thus it fulfills the requirements of the DVG-testing standards and guidlines. The three tested disinfectants with the different drug components meet the target minimum efficiencies of DVG disinfectant commission (98 % in suspension test, 95 % in <b>germ</b> <b>carrier</b> tests) within the prescribed exposure times at 3 % concentration. Eggs and full soaked adults are recommended for testing the effectiveness of a disinfectants against harmful arthropod D. gallinae eggs...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there have been}} {{increased}} incidences of MRSA detection in animals, too. Besides pets like dogs and cats, livestock above all pigs and calves are particularly affected. Whereas an MRSA infection in pets is normally linked with the outbreak of disease, livestock are almost always <b>germ</b> <b>carriers</b> who manifest no symptoms. As a rule, the colonisation of pets and livestock also differs {{in terms of the}} detected MRSA type. In pets the dominant types are the ones that also occur in man. In contrast, mainly one specific type of MRSA is found in livestock which up to now had rarely been linked to disease in man. Contact with the living livestock can indeed carry the risk of humans becoming infected with MRSA. People could also come into contact with MRSA through food. The results of a Dutch study showed that lower levels of the germs also occurred in raw meat which was intended for human con-sumption. MRSA could be isolated not only from pork and veal but also from the meat from chickens, turkeys and cattle. As a consequence of the publication of an interim risk assessment by the Dutch Authority for Food Safety and Consumer Products (VWA), the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) examined this assessment and expressed its opinion on whether meat, that has been shown to contain MRSA, contributes to the spread of germs and increases the risk of human infec-tion.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of disinfectants is verified {{on the basis}} of the results of test methods that have undergone continuous change in line with new scientific insights. To begin with, the prime focus was on the relevance of practical measures: <b>germ</b> <b>carriers</b> were contaminated with, for example, the sputum of patients suffering from tuberculosis or with stools, while the data provided on the recoverable bacteria following exposure were very imprecise since they were based on subjective evaluation – using different methods for the various countries. With the development of the quantitative suspension test various factors of influence were analyzed for the first time and the concept of reduction factors with logarithmic units was introduced. Today, such insights are viewed as something to be taken for granted in all European and international standards. European standardization orchestrated by the European Commission received important impetus from one scientist: H. Reber. An important aspect here was that the European standards introduced and recognized in principle a separation of the methods into “in-vitro tests” and “tests conducted under everyday practice conditions”. The increasingly more precise test methods have, on the other hand, soon revealed shortcomings in the disinfectant performance of even commonly used and hitherto accepted products. This gave rise to tests with a lower margin of error and with quantitative requirements. It is only by having a uniform overview that it is possible to detect and eliminate such shortcomings. The closure of several Hygiene Institutes at German and Austrian universities and the ongoing confinement of this discipline (infection control) to microbiology have additionally meant that already today there is a shortage of infection control experts who have a holistic view of matters and are able to spearhead further development of test methods. Without experts capable of taking a holistic view of matters, it will not be possible to create an atmosphere conducive to the development, and evaluation, of test methods, as needed for quality assurance. The less often disinfectants are evaluated by competent specialists, the greater is the risk that dangers are not recognized and countered...|$|R

Breast cancers in BRCA 1 <b>germ</b> line mutation <b>carriers</b> have distinct clinicopathological characteristics. Biomarkers that discriminate between BRCA 1 -related and sporadic breast cancer cases are needed to improve early identification of mutation carriers. In this study we evaluated protein expression of five major claudins in BRCA 1 -related breast cancers in comparison with sporadic controls. Methods and resultsForty breast cancers in BRCA 1 mutation carriers and 40 age-matched sporadic breast cancers were immunohistochemically stained for claudins 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7.

In this study, we comment on the need of additional bilateral prophylactic salpingectomy (BPS) following previous bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy (BPO) in women at high risk of ovarian cancer. Retrospectively, the medical files of 42 high-risk women, who had undergone BPO only, were reviewed. In our center, risk-reducing surgery consisted of BPO only for 42 women. Twenty-seven women received an informative letter in which counseling for additional BPS was offered. In total, 15 women opted for additional BPS. Surgery was performed with a mean interval of 65 months (range 6 - 101) in 10 BRCA 1 carriers, one BRCA 2 carrier, one BRCA 1 and 2 carrier, and three women with non-informative test results. The procedure was readily done by laparoscopy in 13 women and two needed a laparotomy. No post-operative complications had occurred. Histopathological examination revealed no malignancy. We believe that additional risk reduction of cancer necessitates BPS in BRCA 1 / 2 carriers after previous BPO. BPS after previous BPO was easily performed.

Results A searchable database (RBGMdb) has been constructed with 932 published RB 1 mutations. The spectrum of these mutations has been analyzed with the following results: 1) the retinoblastoma protein is frequently inactivated by deletions and nonsense mutations while missense mutations are the main inactivating event in most genetic diseases. 2) Near 40 % of RB 1 gene mutations are recurrent and gather in sixteen hot points, including twelve nonsense, two missense and three splicing mutations. The remainder mutations are scattered along RB 1, being most frequent in exons 9, 10, 14, 17, 18, 20, and 23. 3) The analysis of RB 1 mutations by country of origin of the patients identifies two groups in which the incidence of nonsense and splicing mutations show differences extremely significant, and suggest the involvement of predisposing ethnic backgrounds. 4) A significant association between late age at diagnosis and splicing mutations in bilateral retinoblastoma patients suggests the occurrence of a delayed-onset genotype. 5) Most of the reported mutations in low-penetrance families fall in three groups: a) Mutations in regulatory sequences at the promoter resulting in low expression of a normal Rb; b) Missense and in-frame deletions affecting non-essential sequence motifs which result in a partial inactivation of Rb functions; c) Splicing mutations leading to the reduction of normal mRNA splicing or to alternative splicing involving either true oncogenic or defective (weak) alleles.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a standardised and practice relevant method for ‘direct process control’, which is suitable for large communal as well as smaller agricultural co-fermentation plants, we first analysed the suitability of <b>germ</b> <b>carriers</b> and the tenacity of various test organisms. These analyses were conducted in anaerobic mesophilic and thermophilic lab-scale fermenters and in a pasteurising container (70 - 90 °C). The aim was to identify an indicator organism that can be detected quickly and inexpensively by conventional techniques, and which is also highly thermoresistant and has epidemiological relevance. In thermophilic lab-scale fermenters (55 °C), the tenacity of Salmonella Senftenberg W 775, Ascaris suum, Campylobacter jejuni, ‘wild type’ coliphage, as well as coliphage T 1, and Enterococcus faecalis was investigated. Whereas Salmonella Senftenberg W 775, Ascaris suum, and Campylobacter jejuni could be inactivated within 3 hours, Enterococcus faecalis survived for more than 3 hours, and a wild type coliphage could be detected even after more than 24 hours. Tenacity experiments in mesophilic lab-scale fermenters (35 °C) showed no inactivation {{of any of the}} test organisms within 24 hours. Heating to temperatures between 70 - 90 °C showed that both Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis and Ascaris suum were eliminated within 30 minutes at 70 °C. Enterococcus faecalis, wilde type coliphage, and Salmonellae could not be detected after 1 hour of incubation at 70 °C. The coliphage T 1 could be eliminated only after 90 minutes at 70 °C. For the most part, these results were confirmed by investigations in operating fermentation plants, with the exception that, under practice conditions, wild type coliphage as well as coliphage T 1 need to be pasteurised for 1 hour at 70 °C to be inactivated. The thermophilic fermentation alone (52 – 55 °C) is not enough to inactivate coliphage T 1 within 24 hours. Coliphage T 1 presents a test organism that, with regard to its thermoresistance, should be placed above Salmonella Senftenberg W 775 and Enterococcus faecalis. Its handling is unproblematic and results can be obtained within a day. Its use as a ‘test organism’ should be discussed, especially in relation to the regulation (EC) no. 1774 / 2002 (ANONYM, 2002), for usage of category III material, whereby further research is needed in this context. In order to obtain a product, which is safe with regard to health risks, it is suggested to choose the following temperature/ time combinations for direct process control in anaerobic fermenters: -Thermophilic fermenters: 55 °C/ 22 - 24 hours -Pasteurising: 70 C/ 1 hour. However, if the coliphage T 1 will become relevant as a test organism in the future, the present results show that heating to 70 °C/ 2 hours or 80 °C/ 1 hour are required. The thermophilic processes at 55 °C and an assured retention time of 22 - 24 hours are not sufficient to eliminate coliphage T 1. With regard to thermophilic wet fermentation processes without pre- or post heating steps, which do not warrant plug flow, it is absolutely necessary to obtain data for the exact retention times (minimum retention time) of substrate particles or the liquid phase. Establishing the exact retention time of particles in a thermophilic fermentation plant offers the possibility to limit the contact times of indicator organisms to predetermined retention times of a particular fermenter during the conduct of direct process monitoring. The strict demand of the required incubation times during process monitoring of 22 - 24 hours could thus be shortened. A Bacillus globigii spore suspension was used as a biological tracer because it could previously be shown in lab-scale fermenters that this thermoresistant bacterium, which is not present in the natural flora of substrates used in anaerobic fermenters, can be optimally mixed with infeed materials, and the influences of processes in anaerobic fermenters are unable to eliminate Bacillus globigii. The use of a Bacillus globigii spore suspension was investigated in 3 selected treatment plants. Its value as a biological tracer to determine absolute retention times was, amongst other things, also seen in a large communal anaerobic fermentation plant (> 3. 000 m 3), as well as in a mixing drum for drying sewage sludge. In addition to the ‘direct process control’, the substrate from the different biogas plants, was examined for its Salmonella, enterococci and total and faecal coliforms content before and after the thermal treatment. The purpose of these assays was to ensure the efficiency of the process used in the biogas plants. According to the results of this study, thermophilic anaerobic digestion ensures better inactivation of microorganisms than anarerobic digestion at mesophilic temperatures. However, the complete inactivation of microorganisms was not possible without additional pasteurisation. It is advisable to still call for the so-called ‘direct process control’ even under an amended bio-waste regulation (BioAbfV). For it provides a definite indication that the processes in a particular plant, with its given technical set-up by using defined substrates, are principally able to yield a hygienically risk-free end product. This study was carried out in 2002. According to Regulation (EC) No. 2008 / 2006 (Anonymus, 2006 a) from February 2006, the validation of biotechnological processes in composting and biogas plants must to be carried out using two test organisms: Salmonella Senftenberg H 2 S negative and Enterococcus faecalis...|$|R
40|$|Hereditary nonpolyposis {{colorectal}} cancer (HNPCC) is an autosomal dominantly inherited cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germ line mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, predominantly MLH 1 and MSH 2, with large genomic rearrangements accounting for 5 % to 20 % of all mutations. Although {{crucial to the}} understanding of cancer initiation, {{little is known about the}} second, somatic hit in HNPCC tumorigenesis, commonly referred to as loss of heterozygosity. Here, we applied a recently developed method, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, to study MLH 1 /MSH 2 copy number changes in 16 unrelated Swiss HNPCC patients, whose cancers displayed microsatellite instability and loss of MLH 1 or MSH 2 expression, but in whom no germ line mutation could be detected by conventional screening. The aims of the study were (a) to determine the proportion of large genomic rearrangements among Swiss MLH 1 /MSH 2 mutation carriers and (b) to investigate the frequency and nature of loss of heterozygosity as a second, somatic event, in tumors from MLH 1 /MSH 2 <b>germ</b> line deletion <b>carriers.</b> Large genomic deletions were found to account for 4. 3 % and 10. 7 % of MLH 1 and MSH 2 mutations, respectively. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis of 18 cancer specimens from two independent sets of Swiss and Finnish MLH 1 /MSH 2 deletion carriers revealed that somatic mutations identical to the ones in the germ line occur frequently in {{colorectal cancer}}s (6 of 11; 55 %) and are also present in extracolonic HNPCC-associated tumors. Chromosome-specific marker analysis implies that loss of the wild-type allele predominantly occurs through locus-restricted recombinational events, i. e., gene conversion, rather than mitotic recombination or deletion of the respective gene locus.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of screening {{is to identify}} cases of ovarian cancer in early stages. However, screening {{of women in the}} general population is ineffective due to a failure of detecting early-stage disease and high false positive rates of CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) monitoring. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate ovarian cancer screening by means of pelvic examination, serum CA 125 and TVU in a consecutive series of high-risk women. Clinical data were collected from 132 BRCA 1, 20 BRCA 2 <b>germ</b> line mutation <b>carriers,</b> 72 members of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) families and 88 breast cancer patients from a hereditary breast cancer (HBC) family, seen between January 1996 and December 2002. Among 10 women with an elevated CA 125 level and a positive TVU, three screening carcinomas (one FIGO stage IC, one stage IIIB and one stage IV) and one interval carcinoma (stage IV) were detected. Five occult ovarian/fallopian tube carcinomas (two stage IA, one stage IC, one stage IIIB and one stage IV) after bilateral prophylactic (salpingo-) oophorectomy (BP(S) O) have been found in 152 women. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) of the combination of CA 125 and TVU were the highest (40 %, 99 %, 40 % and 99 %) followed by CA 125 alone (50 %, 96 %, 13 % and 99 %), pelvic exam (40 %, 98 %, 21 % and 99 %) and TVU, separately (40 %, 90 %, 6 % and 99 %). By combining CA 125 with TVU results, a PPV of 40 % was achieved. However, the diagnostic tools appear to be only sensitive in detecting ovarian cancer at an advanced stage, while three of four tumors with early-stage disease in this series had normal screening tests prior to the diagnosi...|$|R
