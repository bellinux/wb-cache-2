The use of finite element method integrated with boundary element method based computer software in engineering field has shown growing interest due to shorter duration of analysis and easy to use. In this analysis, observation of vibration characteristic for two-stroke <b>engine's</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> is carried out. Initially, finite elements are used to create the <b>engine's</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> model. Data gained from modal analysis is used for prediction of noise radiation from <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> surfaces. At this stage, acoustic boundary element model is preferred instead of finite element model. Finally, {{the results of this study}} can be used for further analysis in designing of two-stroke gasoline engine...|$|R

5000|$|A junk head {{is a form}} of piston <b>engine</b> <b>{{cylinder}}</b> <b>head,</b> {{where the}} head is formed by a dummy piston mounted inside the top of the cylinder.

5000|$|To {{comply with}} German safety {{requirements}} the Solo was initially designed with a harness that allowed jettisoning the engine package in flight.

This feature survives in the present day Solo Jettison model. To meet noise requirements the small two-stroke engine has a complex [...] "wrap-around" [...] style exhaust and extra-long muffler system that results in a low sound output.

50|$|In 1942, at {{the height}} of World War II, Bill Brodey was engaged in selling various tools and {{machines}} including Joseph Sunnen honing machines used for honing cylinder bores of engines. Torque wrenches were being imported and sold alongside of the honing machines because it was known that uneven torque tightening of <b>engine</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> bolts would distort the cylinder bore. Bill and his friend Ernest Thornitt applied to the UK Ministry of Supply requesting permission to manufacture torque wrenches in the UK. Torque wrenches were much in demand for the manufacture of Rolls-Royce Merlin aero engines and the UK Government was keen to manufacture in the UK wherever possible to reduce pressure on the Atlantic supply convoys. Consequently, permission was granted to 'The North Bar Tool Company' to start manufacturing torque wrenches in 'North Bar Place', Banbury in the United Kingdom. The address 'North Bar' gave the company its name and this was later contracted to 'Norbar'.|$|E

50|$|A helical insert is {{an insert}} made of coiled wire. The {{helically}} formed coils of diamond shaped stainless steel or phosphor bronze wire screw into a threaded hole {{to form a}} mating internal thread for a screw or stud. These inserts provide a convenient means of repairing stripped-out threads and are also used to provide stronger threads in soft materials such as aluminium, zinc die castings, wood, magnesium etc. than {{can be obtained by}} direct tapping of the base metal involved. Another common generic name is screw thread insert (STI), although many users persist in calling them all by a prominent brand name, the registered trademark Heli-Coil. Applications include <b>engine</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> repair after unintentional over-torquing or cross-threading of spark plugs strips the thread of the socket. Kits with matched tap and coil exist for this. The straight radial piece in the photo is the driver tang which is used as a key to grip with pliers for driving the coil into place and is discarded after installation.|$|E
5000|$|In 1981, {{a diesel}} engine option was new with a late 1981 {{availability}} — (1.8 L Isuzu unit). New styled steel wheels with center caps were offered {{and the previous}} wheel and hubcap design was discontinued. Domestic models received a new computer command control feedback system on gasoline engines. The HO option was discontinued. Electronic spark timing was used on 1981 models in place of manual timing advance. A new <b>engine</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> design (swirl-port) was introduced to improve low-end torque and fuel economy. The Pontiac T1000 was introduced, which shared all body stampings with the Chevette, featuring a chrome center with black trimmed grille and headlight buckets as well as standard chrome window trim with black area fill. Power steering was a new option {{as well as a}} 3.36 axle ratio (standard on T-1000 models). The active passive restraint system was discontinued. New lighter-weight bucket seats were introduced that lacked much of the lower support of the heavier [...] "panned" [...] seats.

5000|$|In November 1971, Ford of Australia {{began to}} {{manufacture}} the 302 cuin L Cleveland engine at the Geelong engine plant alongside of the 351C. The engine remained in production until 1982 {{and was only}} produced in Australia. The 302C was considered an economy V8 and {{it is estimated that}} only ten percent of Australian Cleveland V8 production was the 302C. The 302C was created by using the 351C block with a crankshaft that had a 3.0 in stroke while it shared the 2.75" [...] main journal size of the 351C. The 302C had a 6.020 in connecting rod to allow it to share the same piston as the 351C. This resulted in a connecting rod-to-stroke ratio of 2.01:1, the least desirable of any of the 335 series V8s. The 302C used a unique cylinder head compared to the Australian 351C to ensure an adequate compression ratio. The 302C had used the [...] "quench" [...] closed combustion chamber with a volume of 56.4-59.4 cc, the smallest of any 335 series <b>engine</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>head.</b> This head used the small 2V ports and valves, making it the only 335 series head with the closed chambers and small 2V ports.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} reconstruct internal combustion engine cylinder press-ure from the <b>engine</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> vibration signals, using radial basis function (RBF) networks. The relationship between the cylinder pressure and the <b>engine</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> vibration signals is analysed rst. Then, an RBF network is applied to establish the non-parametric mapping model between the cylinder pressure time series and the <b>engine</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> vibration signal frequency series. The structure of the RBF network model is presented. The fuzzy c-means clustering method and the gradient descent algorithm are used for selecting the centres and training the output layer weights of the RBF network respectively. Finally, the validation of this approach to cylinder pressure reconstruc-tion from vibration signals is demonstrated on a two-cylinder, four-stroke direct injection diesel engine, with data {{from a wide range}} of speed and load settings. The prediction capabilities of the trained RBF network model are validated against measured data...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Maintaining {{adequate}} sealing in <b>engine</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>head</b> is {{a crucial}} factor in engine design.

However, analytical reliability-robustness concept may make possible to reduce the sensitivity of system with noise factors. Influences of design factors including noise factors would be predicted in analytical way. Optimized design may be obtained by shrinking variability and shifting to design target.

50|$|Modern <b>engines</b> have <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> made {{of either}} iron or aluminum. Iron <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads</b> most often have {{integral}} iron valve seats. These seats are the softest and most susceptible to wear among modern <b>engine.</b> Aluminum <b>cylinder</b> <b>heads,</b> however, have hardened steel valve seats, as aluminum {{would make a}} very poor seat. These hardened steel seats are significantly better than the integral seats of an iron head, and can be relatively easily removed and replaced if needed. If an integral iron seat needs to be replaced, the seat must be milled to allow the insert of a new seat. The new seat is then installed with application of a high-strength metal glue/adhesive. Once installed, the seat is ground to the correct angle and width.|$|R
