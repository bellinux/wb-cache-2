40|$|A code {{is defined}} to be {{reversible}} if its code-word set is invariant under {{a reversal of}} the digits in each code word. Such codes may have application in certain data storage and retrieval systems. It is shown that cyclic codes and convolutional codes are reversible when and only when their code-generating polynomials are self-reciprocal. Reversible codes are quite rare therefore, but it is shown that an important subclass of the Bose-Chaudhuri codes consists entirely of reversible codes. Techniques are developed by which any nonreversible cyclic code can be converted into a reversible cyclic code with at least as much error-correcting power, but at the cost of increased code redundancy. The redundancy of the <b>derived</b> <b>code</b> is at most twice that of the original code, and the <b>derived</b> <b>code</b> can be decoded by a decoder constructed for the original code. Similarly, it is shown how any nonreversible convolutional code can be converted into a reversible convolutional code with at least as much error-correcting power, but at the cost of increased code constraint length. Again the <b>derived</b> <b>code</b> can be decoded by substantially the same decoder as for the original code...|$|E

40|$|With {{increasing}} {{complexity of}} modern embedded systems, {{the availability of}} highly optimizing compilers {{becomes more and more}} important. At the same time, application specific instruction-set processors (ASIPs) are used to fine-tune hardware platforms to the intended application, demanding the availability of retargetable components throughout the whole tool chain. A very promising approach is to model the target architecture using a dedicated description language that is rich enough to generate hardware components and the required tool chain, e. g., assembler, linker, simulator, and compiler. In this work we present a new structural architecture description language (ADL) that is used to derive the architecture dependent components of a compiler backend — most notably an instruction selector based on tree pattern matching. We combine our backend with gcc, thereby opening up the way for a large number of readily available high level optimizations.

Understanding concerns of patients diagnosed with cancer helps health care professionals to provide appropriate caring plans. This study aimed to understand main concerns of patients who confront cancer diagnosis. Methods & Materials: This was a qualitative study with content analysis approach. Fifteen patients with cancer were selected from a specialized hospital, an oncology clinic, and Emdad Center of Cancer patients in Sari using a purposeful sampling method during May 2011 to June 2012. The sample size was completed regarding data saturation. Data were collected using interviews, observations and recording field notes. All interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using descriptive content analysis and the Granhim and Landmann method. Results: Three categories including 485 primary codes were emerged. The <b>derived</b> <b>codes</b> were as follows: 1) sever personal and family disturbance; 2) imagination of despair; and 3) unclear imagination of future. The main code included in all <b>derived</b> <b>codes</b> was life threatening nature of cancer.

One {{of the reasons for the}} insufficient performance of automatically <b>derived</b> <b>code</b> is the lack of ability of the implementation tools to adjust to a given implementation context. To cope with this situation, the application of variable implementation models has been proposed. Such implementation models require appropriate languages constructs to tailor an implementation model that meets the specific requirements of the implementation context.

We describe the different features of iSDL and show how it can be applied to select different implementation strategies. (orig.)

40|$|Is the {{extraction}} of a visually <b>derived</b> semantic <b>code</b> from faces (ethnicity) affected by face identity (familiarity) or not? The traditional view considers that this operation is made independently of face identity, and in parallel with the recognition of identity. However, some recent studies cast doubt on this parallel thesis regarding other visually <b>derived</b> semantic <b>codes,</b> namely: facial expression, facial speech, apparent age, and gender. Twenty-eight Caucasian participants were enrolled in an 'ethnic-decision' task on morphed faces made of an Asiatic source face and a Caucasian source face, {{in the proportion of}} 70 %- 30 %. Half of the original faces were previously made familiar by a learning procedure (associating the face, surname, occupation, and city of residence of the person displayed), while the remaining half were unfamiliar. The results showed clearly that ethnic decision was affected by face familiarity. This adds support to the thesis according to which the identification of identity and {{the extraction}} of visually <b>derived</b> semantic <b>codes</b> are not made independently from each other and that the 'parallel-route' hypothesis becomes weakly supported...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Polytypic {{functional}} programming {{has the advantage}} that it can <b>derive</b> <b>code</b> for generic functions automatically. However, {{it is not clear}} whether it is useful for anything other than the textbook examples, and the generated polytypic code is usually too slow for real-life programs. As a real-life test, we derive a polytypic parser for the Haskell 98 syntax and look into other front-end compiler syntax tree operations. We present a types–as–grammar approach, which uses polytypic programming (in both Generic Haskell and Clean) to automatically <b>derive</b> the <b>code</b> for a parser based on the syntax tree type, without using external tools. Moreover, we show that using polytypic programming can even be useful for data–specific syntax tree operations in a (functional) compiler, such as scope checking and type inference. Simple speed tests show that the performance of polytypic parsers can be abominable for real-life inputs. However, we show that much performance can be recovered by applying (extended) fusion optimization on the generated code. We actually have a derived parser whose speed is close to one generated by a specialized Haskell parser generator. ...|$|R

Particular {{attention is paid to}} considerations of heat transfer from the consequent reactor efflux in the situation of full-pressure containments, and various schemes given in the literature and used in computer codes for calculating condensation heat transfer are critically examined. An experimental study has been made in conditions typical of the postulated reactor accident situation using a rig consisting of a O 0. 014 m high pressure vessel which could discharge its contents through a defined flow path into a 2 m 3 steel containment vessel. The rig is instrumented to measure the instantaneous pressure and temperature distribution during a pressure vessel blowdown. It includes a system for measuring the condensation heat transfer coefficient transient in which the transient heat flux and surface temperature at a metal plug are derived from a single measurement of temperature within the plug by use of a Fourier Transform method. A simple point model analysis of the thermohydraulic conditions throughout the blowdown/ containment rig is derived and used to demonstrate the effect on prediction of containment pressure response of various heat transfer schemes and the relationship to the measured response. A new heat transfer scheme is found, based on the measured heat transfer transients which, when used in the <b>derived</b> <b>code,</b> gives reasonable fit to the measured pressure transients over a wide range of initial conditions...|$|E
