40|$|The Internet {{began as}} a {{restricted}} military project and {{has become one of}} the most accessible <b>information</b> <b>mediums</b> in human history. Three aspects of openness have shown influence over this development: open access, open content, and open source. Driven by consumer preference, technological soundness, and political pressure, a continuous growth in openness can be traced through the early development of the Internet, to the launch of proprietary networks such as America Online, and their subsequent adoption of open World Wide Web standards. This thread is connected to the most recent development in openness through America Online’s participation in the founding of the Mozilla Foundation. The rapid adoption of the open source software product, Mozilla Firefox, as the second most popular browser application for the World Wide Web is evidence of the continuing trend toward openness online. Open concepts drive not only the development of Firefox, but also its usability and marketing. The Firefox story is still developing, and the extent of its success may be a measure of the future potential for openness and the World Wide Web, where several challenges to openness are threatening to reverse the trend and entrench enclosur...|$|R

50|$|In {{constructor}} theory, {{a transformation}} or change {{is described as}} a task. A constructor is a physical entity which is able to carry out a given task repeatedly. A task is only possible if a constructor capable of carrying it out exists, otherwise it is impossible. To work with constructor theory everything is expressed in terms of tasks. The properties of information are then expressed as relationships between possible and impossible tasks. Counterfactuals are thus fundamental statements and the properties of information may be described by physical laws.If a system has a set of attributes, the set of permutations of these attributes is seen as a set of tasks. A computation medium is a system whose attributes permute to always produce a possible task. The set of permutations, and hence of tasks, is a computation set. If it is possible to copy the attributes in the computation set, the computation medium is also an <b>information</b> <b>medium.</b>|$|E
50|$|The biggest {{challenge}} is balancing the sometimes conflicting {{needs of the}} patrons and the materials. One of the central themes of the library's mission is to preserve knowledge, {{so that it can}} be passed on to future generations. For over a thousand years books have been the dominant way to do that. While the internet has become the <b>information</b> <b>medium</b> of choice for many, books still play a very important role in the preservation of knowledge. In order to be preserved, books must be kept away from extreme temperatures, moisture, and sunlight. In contrast, many individuals find sunlight to be the most enjoyable light for reading. Sunlight also plays a major role in green design, because it can be used to reduce the reliance on artificial lighting. For a long time, libraries needed to protect the collection from the damaging ultra-violet rays of the sun. New developments in glass technology over the past ten years have given designers more flexibility in their ability to place collections (Mcabe, 2003).|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} inventors of radio, from Guglielmo Marconi's time on, {{expected it}} to be used for one-on-one wireless communication tasks where telephones and telegraphs could not be used because of the problems involved in stringing copper wires from one point to another, such as in ship-to-shore communications. Those inventors had no expectations whatever that radio would become a major mass media entertainment and <b>information</b> <b>medium</b> earning many millions of dollars in revenues annually through radio advertising commercials or sponsorship. These latter uses were brought about after 1920 by business entrepreneurs such as David Sarnoff, who created the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), and William S. Paley, who built Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). These broadcasting (as opposed to narrowcasting) business organizations began to be called network affiliates, because they consisted of loose chains of individual stations located in various cities, all transmitting the standard overall-system supplied fare, often at synchronized agreed-upon times. Some of these radio network stations were owned and operated by the networks, while others were independent radio owned by entrepreneurs allied with the respective networks. By selling blocks of time to advertisers, the medium was able to quickly become profitable and offer its products to listeners for free, provided they invested in a radio receiver set.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the control and {{information}} integration capability of an NC machining system, this paper provides a new concept - an NC feature unit (NCFU), which is a feature-based and a basic control unit. First, as a feature-based control unit, NCFU possesses geometric form and control parameters, which are a subclass of high-level CAD/CAM features {{so that it can}} be used as an <b>information</b> exchange <b>medium</b> between NC machining systems and other manufacturing execution systems. Secondly, as a basic machining control unit, NCFU uses a geometrically defined closed and non-gouging machined area. On the one hand, through decomposition, a machined object can be divided into a combination of several NCFUs. On the other hand, since NCFUs are non-gouging, the algorithm for NCFU-based tool-path generation is simple enough to be executable in real-time. This paper discusses NCFU-based applications in 2 1 / 2 -D profile/pocket and 3 D surface mill machining, including the NCFU definition and the related algorithms for decomposition calculation and area interpolation. A next generation NC machining system based on NCFU, including an NCFU-based NCP and an NCFU-based CNC system, has been prototyped by China's State 863 /CIMS Design Automation Laboratory in Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. An NCFU is being used as the <b>information</b> exchange <b>medium</b> in an internet-integrated manufacturing system with NC machining at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
