500|$|In 2005, Sharon Osbourne {{went to see}} Wicked Wisdom {{perform at}} a small nightclub in Los Angeles. She said, [...] "I was blown away. When you see and hear Jada with her band it's {{apparent}} that she has nothing but love and respect for this genre of music". In May 2005 organizers announced Wicked Wisdom would perform on {{the second stage of}} 2005's Ozzfest. Fans of the festival were outraged, claiming the band did not have the credibility to perform at the music festival. Aware of the questions about the band's addition to Ozzfest, Pinkett Smith said, [...] "I'm not here asking for any favors. You've got to show and prove. And not every audience is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> it." [...] Wicked Wisdom's guitarist Pocket Honore said while early dates of the tour were rocky, [...] "once word got out that we weren't a joke, people started coming out and by the sixth or seventh gig we were on fire". Pinkett Smith agreed, saying, [...] "After seven dates within the Ozzfest tour, the whole attitude of it started to turn around once the word of mouth started getting out." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2010, TVNZ {{garnered}} criticism over various {{comments made}} by Breakfast host Paul Henry. Henry had referred to Delhi Commonwealth Games organiser Sheila Dikshit as [...] "the dip shit woman" [...] and [...] "Dick Shit", going on to state that [...] "it's so appropriate, because she's Indian, so she'd be dick-in-shit wouldn't she, {{do you know what}} I mean? Walking along the street... she's just so funny, isn't she?" [...] Henry also questioned whether the Governor-General of New Zealand Anand Satyanand was [...] "even a New Zealander", going on to ask, [...] "Are you going to choose a New Zealander who looks and sounds like a New Zealander this time ... are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> someone who is more like a New Zealander this time?" [...] Following widespread public complaints and official criticism, Henry was suspended from TVNZ for 2 weeks without pay, eventually resigning from the broadcaster. Henry's resignation polarised the New Zealand public, with supporters claiming he was a victim of political correctness, and critics accusing him of pandering to the lowest common denominator.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Brooks {{returned}} to EastEnders for a guest stint. She was later confirmed {{to be coming}} back as a regular character. She said, [...] "I had doubts to begin with, mainly because of Kiki, as I know how full-on EastEnders can be, and then there's that stigma {{about going back to}} a soap. But I'm so pleased I did, it was the right decision. Especially with what's going on at the moment, I feel really lucky to have a job and I need the security because of Kiki. I was just going to go back for a year, but I had a meeting with the boss last week and we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> another year. So lots more time to get up to much mischief". Executive producer Diederick Santer said, [...] "I couldn't be more pleased that Charlie Brooks is re-joining EastEnders. With her appearances last month, she reminded us what a fine actress she is, and what an intriguing, watchable and engaging character she plays as Janine". She temporarily departed in September 2012, and returned in April 2013 before departing again in March 2014.|$|E

2500|$|Result: Both {{teams had}} many suggestions; in Atomic, Lewis came up a seaside-based game {{where they had}} to stop seagulls eating food, Hayley {{came up with a}} looking-after-horse game, and Lizzie came up with a puzzle game where they had to stare at a room for a few seconds and find what is missing. Atomic were {{originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> the puzzle game, but James came up with an office-based game, and despite the market research finding that more people would play the puzzle game, James decided to stick with the office game, calling it [...] "Crazy Cabinet". In Kinetic, the team decided to do a game with an animal in it. (Mahamad wanted a zombie game, {{but the rest of the}} team disagreed.) Haya came up with the character of a pig (since she was a vegetarian), which the rest of the team agreed. Along with the pig, they created an evil butcher, calling their game [...] "Piggy Panic". The next day, the teams launched their viral ads in front of Lord Sugar and an audience of gaming experts. Both teams gave both good viral ads and presentations and the experts were impressed. In the boardroom, Lord Sugar thought James's game was better placed for future add-on revenue, though also believed that Zara's game had more merchandising potential.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} for The Electricity Club site, Marnie said: [...] "I played around {{with the idea for}} a couple of years and joked about it for while. I had a handful of songs and when Ladytron had some time off last year, I began to believe it could be a reality. I thought if I have the opportunity, I'm just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> it. So I started writing as much as I could." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to {{campaign}} manager Rick Davis, Palin thought the questions would be softer than they were: [...] "She {{was under the}} impression the Couric thing was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be easier than it was. Everyone's guard was down for the Couric interview." [...] "I knew it didn't go well the first day, and then we gave her a couple of other segments after that," [...] Palin said in a retrospective with conservative filmmaker John Ziegler on the Couric interview. [...] "My question to the campaign was, after it didn't go well the first day, why were we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>for</b> more? Because of however it works in that upper echelon of power brokering, in the media and with spokespersons, it was told to me, yeah, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>for</b> more. And going back for more was not a wise decision, either." ...|$|R

Henri, {{making the most}} of Franck's absence, goes to see Michel and tells him he's convinced that the recent drowning wasn't an accident, that he has realised that Michel was the killer, and that the inspector will identify the murderer sooner or later. He looks at Michel knowingly and mockingly, then stands up and says he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> a walk in the woods. As he enters the woods, he casts a glance back at Michel.|$|E
5000|$|On 5 October 2010 TVNZ Breakfast {{show host}} Paul Henry {{questioned}} whether Sir Anand was [...] "even a New Zealander".

5000|$|The {{album is}} {{the first and only}} to {{showcase}} all three vocalists. Drummer Skinny described it as [...] "very energetic, dark and by far their heaviest album to date, just a fresh spin on the same old thing if you will. This {{is the first}} record with Church on guitar and Farrell on bass, so having those new writers on board you never know where it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>For</b> the old school fans there's a lot of flavorful elements in it so they will definitely enjoy it."

5000|$|Last year, Wayne Rainey {{lost any}} {{chance at the}} {{championship}} by crashing on this track, and this year he has a points advantage on Kevin Schwantz, but a DNF would just about erase the lead. He’s asked:Q: “Is {{this going to be}} one of the occasions when you go for points rather than a win?”WR: “Well, I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> both; it’s going to be tough tomorrow for those guys that have been going fast—if they go the same speed tomorrow; so we’re just going to ride around, have some fun and collect all the points we can get.”Q: “You’ll be satisfied then if you don’t win?”WR: “No.” ...|$|E

All members had previously been in different local bands. [...] The band has stated their name originates from a character from the film Natural Born Killers, saying [...] "We wanted a character name, preferably someone with a dark edge and dark side and we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> Dorian Gray {{but at the time}} there was a cheesy Hollywood movie coming out of Dorian Gray so we went for Mallory because of that.".|$|E

It's going to be dangerous, but look at me going in there anyway... I think that for me, it was the first time I ever kind of noticed that in myself, like when you are curious about something you know might be bad for you, but you know that you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> it anyway because if you don't, you'll have greater regrets about not seeing where that would go, but I think that for me it all went along with this record that was pushing boundaries, like the sound of this record pushes boundaries, it was writing about something I hadn't written before." ...|$|E
50|$|Marley {{eventually}} {{returned to}} face the music. When it appeared Marley was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down <b>for</b> the crime, Donna confessed to shooting Jake, {{even though she was}} also innocent. In her fake confession, Donna had to admit she slept with Jake. Luckily, Donna was cleared, but her marriage to Michael was over and Marley {{wanted nothing to do with}} her.

5000|$|Rodriguez {{shared his}} {{thoughts}} on how the score should play out saying: I think we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> something that fits {{the tone of the}} movie really well. That original score went great with the movie, but the notes and the music do really evoke a quality - you know, when he (Debney) showed me his rough cut, or some scenes, {{every once in a while}} at the right moment I started hearing strings from the score - because we had a temp score, and it really works.... So we'll probably incorporate some of that. At the right time, because you don't want to overuse it. But it's like the James Bond theme - you can't use it all of the time, but when you do, you can get the audience really, really pumped.|$|E

[...] Establishing that Tom's daddy wasn't given a peerage, Tony gives him a present - his prize guitar - and begins to sing the anthemic finale song [...] "Faith."

Within two years of that event, the Soviet Union itself dissolved and the Cold War was over. These events were unimaginable even {{only a few years}} before they occurred. As late as the mid- 1980 s, it was assumed by most policy makers {{on both sides of the}} Cold War divide that the Cold War was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on <b>for</b> a long time, if not forever.

5000|$|Anthony {{has wanted}} to expand the number of outlets his sauces reach, {{and in order to}} do that he has had to make some changes to the packaging.

But unfortunately places like Trader Joe's bigger outlets take a look at the bottle and go, 'No, I don't think we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> that.' So we're in the process of revamping that. It's actually only on the one bottle of my hot sauce. On my barbecue sauce or my mustard we didn't use any of that kind of language. I'm not going to do the full-on blowout thing, but it would be cool to expand a little bit more because I've got people that work with companies like Trader Joe's, which is a big specialty store, and they're interested in doing something." ...|$|E
