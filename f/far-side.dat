5|$|The {{continuous}} {{shadows in}} the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about 100K. For Shackleton, the average temperature {{was determined to be}} about 90K, reaching 88K at the crater floor. Under these conditions, the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10−26 to 10−27m/s. Any water vapor that arrives here following a cometary impact on the Moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface. However, the surface albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar <b>far-side,</b> suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice.|$|E
25|$|The {{crust of}} the Moon is on average about 50km thick (though this is {{uncertain}} by about ±15km). It {{is widely believed}} that the <b>far-side</b> crust is on average thicker than the near side by about 15km. Seismology has constrained {{the thickness of the}} crust only near the Apollo 12 and 14 landing sites. Although the initial Apollo-era analyses suggested a crustal thickness of about 60km at this site, recent reanalyses of this data suggest that it is thinner, somewhere between about 30 and 45km.|$|E

A double bottom extended past the armored traverse bulkheads {{and a thin}} longitudinal bulkhead provided some measure of protection against flooding. It has been judged too thin to withstand a torpedo's detonation, but possibly the <b>far-side</b> bulkhead might survive intact, which would cause a list from asymmetrical flooding.|$|E
500|$|The {{topography}} of the Moon has been measured with laser altimetry and stereo image analysis. Its most visible topographic {{feature is the}} giant <b>far-side</b> South Pole–Aitken basin, some [...] in diameter, the largest crater on the Moon and the second-largest confirmed impact crater in the Solar System. At [...] deep, its floor is the lowest point {{on the surface of}} the Moon. The highest elevations of the Moon's surface are located directly to the northeast, and it has been suggested might have been thickened by the oblique formation impact of the South Pole–Aitken basin. Other large impact basins, such as Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Smythii, and Orientale, also possess regionally low elevations and elevated rims. The far side of the lunar surface is on average about [...] higher than that of the near side.|$|E
500|$|Walker {{elected to}} stand {{north of the}} Chongchon and Taeryong rivers in {{response}} to the Chinese offensive, and the following day Coad received new orders to hold the left forward section of the bridgehead over the Chongchon. To halt the Chinese advance, the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade was ordered to defend the lower crossings of the Taeryong and Chongchon rivers as part of a rearguard, in conjunction with the US 24th Infantry Division further upstream on the right. The brigade [...] concentrated in the Pakchon area. The Middlesex occupied the town and the high ground to the north and east, while 3 RAR and the Argylls held positions covering the western approaches to the Taeryong, with the latter designated as the brigade reserve. Yet the information available to the British and Australians suggested that the Chinese would likely attack from an easterly direction, and the dispositions adopted by Coad were later criticised for failing to take this into account. 3 RAR took up a defensive position [...] west of the village, where it remained for the next two days. Meanwhile, B and C Companies of the Argylls formed a bridgehead over the Taeryong around the <b>far-side</b> of the partially destroyed bridge near Kujin, while A Company occupied positions astride the road to the south. To the right, the US 24th Infantry Division covered the crossing over the Chongchon at Anju, while the South Korean II ROK Corps held positions further east. Forced to defend on a wide frontage, the UN positions were weakened [...] by a [...] gap between the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade and the nearest American formation—2nd Battalion, US 19th Regimental Combat Team (2/19 RCT)—on the brigade's eastern flank.|$|E

2500|$|Helioseismic holography, {{introduced}} in detail by Lindsey and Braun {{for the purpose}} of <b>far-side</b> (magnetic) imaging, a special case of phase-sensitive holography. The idea is to use the wavefield on the visible disk to learn about active regions {{on the far side of}} the Sun. The basic idea in helioseismic holography is that the wavefield, e.g., the line-of-sight Doppler velocity observed at the solar surface, can be used to make an estimate of the wavefield at any location in the solar interior at any instant in time. In this sense, holography is much like seismic migration, a technique in geophysics that has been in use since the 1940s. As another example, this technique has been used to give a seismic image of a solar flare. Acoustic holography, applied to MDI data, is ideal for the detection of sources and sinks of acoustic waves on the Sun. Braun and Fan [...] discovered a region of lower acoustic emission in the 3 – 4 mHz frequency band which extends far beyond the sunspots (the ‘acoustic moat’). Acoustic moats extend beyond magnetic regions into the quiet Sun. In addition, Braun and Lindsey [...] discovered high-frequency emission (‘acoustic glories’) surrounding active regions.|$|E

5000|$|Aside from speed {{blocking}} a guard {{may also}} [...] "pull"—backing {{out of his}} initial position and running behind the other offensive linemen to sprinting {{out in front of}} a running back to engage a defensive player beyond the initial width of the offensive line. This technique is used in most playbooks for outside runs (where the play-side guard pulls as a lead blocker) and on counter plays (where the <b>far-side</b> guard pulls to block a play-side Lineman). Vanderbilt's Dan McGugin is credited with first pulling guards.While tackles can also pull, this strategy is generally less common as they are too far away to pull to {{the opposite side of the}} formation (for counter plays) and have the responsibility of blocking the outside defender (generally the defensive end) for outside runs. Since the guard is free of responsibility for play-side outside runs and <b>far-side</b> counter plays, pulling is generally a unique responsibility for guards.|$|E

50|$|Another {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} Moon's shape is that the elevations are on average about 1.9 km higher {{on the far side}} than the near side. If it is assumed that the crust is in isostatic equilibrium, and that the density of the crust is everywhere the same, then the higher elevations would be associated with a thicker crust. Using gravity, topography and seismic data, the crust is thought to be on average about 50 ± 15 km thick, with the <b>far-side</b> crust being on average thicker than the near side by about 15 km.|$|E

50|$|These {{results were}} met with {{skepticism}} {{in part because they}} contradicted conventional wisdom with one quote being “so you’re the backward astronomers who found the backward galaxy.” The fact that a pair of arms could lead was not easy to accept. Astronomical objections centered on the fact that dust reddening and cloud silhouettes were used to determine that the outer arms lead. The galaxy disk is tilted only 19 degrees from face-on making near to <b>far-side</b> effects of dust hard to discern and because clumpy dust clouds might be concentrated {{on one side of the}} disk, creating misleading results.|$|E

5000|$|The {{gravitational}} {{field of the}} Moon has been measured by tracking the radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft. The principle used depends on the Doppler effect, whereby the line-of-sight spacecraft acceleration can be measured by small shifts in frequency of the radio signal, and the measurement of {{the distance from the}} spacecraft to a station on Earth. Since the {{gravitational field}} of the Moon affects the orbit of a spacecraft, one can use these tracking data to detect gravity anomalies. However, because of the Moon's synchronous rotation {{it is not possible to}} track spacecraft from Earth much beyond the limbs of the Moon, so until the recent GRAIL mission the <b>far-side</b> gravity field was not accurately known.|$|E
50|$|Bus stop {{location}} {{is another important}} consideration. Where there are <b>far-side</b> bus stops, an advance signal does not provide any benefit to the bus because {{it will not be}} able to merge into traffic during the advance signal phase. Where near-side stops are present, an advance signal can be highly effective in giving the bus a head start, however the bus {{stop location}} needs to consider the detection strategy used for the advance signal phase so that the bus is detected only after it is done serving the bus stop.It is preferable to provide a receiving lane on the far side of the intersection to provide an acceleration/merging area, however this is not always a requirement when an advance signal is used.|$|E
