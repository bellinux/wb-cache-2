50|$|Direct laser {{engraving}} of flexographic printing cylinders and plates {{has been an}} established process since the 1970s. This first began {{with the use of}} a carbon dioxide laser used to selectively ablate or evaporate a variety of rubber plate and sleeve materials to produce a print ready surface without the use of photography or chemicals. With this process there is no integral ablation mask as with direct photopolymer laser imaging (see below). Instead a high-power carbon dioxide laser head burns away, or ablates, unwanted material. The aim is to form sharp, relief images with steep first relief and contoured shoulder supported edges to give a high standard of process color reproduction. A short water wash and <b>dry</b> <b>cycle</b> follows, which is a lot less involved than in the post-processing stages for direct laser imaging or conventional flexo platemaking using photopolymer plates. After engraving, the photopolymer is exposed through the imaged black layer and washed out in the traditional photopolymer process requiring photography and chemicals. See below.|$|E

The addition of polymer at 0 and 16 cycles increased considerably the retention and availability of water in sandy soil.

40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out to study the effect of {{alternate}} wetting and <b>drying</b> <b>cycles</b> on the mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification of soil nitrogen in two soils, in {{the presence or absence}} of added ammonium and nitrite. Soils were analyzed at the end of each <b>drying</b> <b>cycle</b> for total inorganic nitrogen, ammonium, and nitrite nitrogen. Gaseous products, i. e., ammonia, and the oxides of nitrogen (NO and NO 2) were collected in the course of drying for determination. The <b>drying</b> <b>cycles</b> accelerated the rate of nitrogen mineralization in both soils and further increased the oxidation of applied and available ammonium. The rate of ammonium transformation was faster in Yolo clay loam soil than in Miami silt loam. A faster rate of nitrification was also observed in Yolo clay loam. This may be because of a higher pH of the Yolo clay loam soil. The successive <b>drying</b> <b>cycles</b> had a pronounced effect on the nitrate formation in both soils. The extent of nitrite decomposition was inversely related to soil pH. The amount of nitrogen oxides (NO and NO 2) evolved were inversely related to soil pH, but significant amounts of NO and N 02 were evolved from even the slightly alkaline Yolo clay loam. The loss of nitrogen oxides increased with increased number of <b>drying</b> <b>cycles</b> and, further, the losses of nitrogen increased with increase in nitrite level. The majority of the nitrogen losses from these soils may be due to the direct decomposition of nitrite and possibly slight losses due to an interaction of nitrite and ammonium ions during the course of drying the soil. A considerable amount of nitrogen remained as undetected in treatments receiving either ammonium or nitrite or both. These losses of nitrogen apparently are other than by the release of NO, NO 2, and NH 3. The undetected nitrogen loss from the soil system may be either in the form of N 2 O or N 2. No volatile losses of ammonia were recorded from the acid Miami silt loam soil.

40|$|Several {{existing}} equations {{for solving}} the non-linear soil-hydraulic properties are introduced and validated to field and laboratory measured data. Models for non-linear hydraulic properties of unsaturated porous media arise from statistical and mathematical fit through the measured data {{and they can}} be expressed in forms of unsaturated permeability versus either pressure head or volumetric moisture content. This paper presents the difference models: Gardner, Knuze et al., Haverkamp et al., van Genuchten and Saxton et al. for calculation of hydraulic properties coefficients, typicallyunsaturated permeability. The accurate and computational efficiency of these five existing models are evaluated for a series of study cases simulating hydraulic properties of unsaturated porous media. The results indicate that all existing models can be applied to homogenous and heterogenous unsaturated porous media, dry and wet cycles and laboratory and field measuring data. Besides, the statistical fit model is inefficient compared to mathematical fit models. Among the mathematical fit models, van Genuchten model is the most promising model. Gardner model can be competitive with van Genuchten model and Haverkamp et al. model is less efficient than others. The mathematical fit models appear to be attractive alternatives to estimate the unsaturated permeability, although there are concerns regarding the stability behaviour of the occupied air in pores, which need to be resolved. The air movement in unsaturated porous media affected the unsaturated permeability, which gives the difference results between wet and <b>dry</b> <b>cycle.</b> Both of unsaturated permeability and volumetric water content of <b>dry</b> <b>cycle</b> were higher than ones of wet cycle. This suggests that the velocity of air-releasing during a wet process was higher than the velocity of air-entering during a dry process. The infiltration is the most important land applications. So, the wet cycle hydraulic properties test might be concerned. Moreover, most of infiltration fields locate on the mixed grain media. So too, the pore-size distribution could affect the unsaturated permeability of porous media. It was observed that the finer material, the lower unsaturated permeability...|$|E

Shasta Reservoir {{maintains}} critical stream habitat {{by releasing}} cold-water on the Sacramento River to almost 50 miles downstream {{in support of}} seasonal spawning runs of endangered fish species. Successful stream temperature management requires sufficient cold water assets in the reservoirs throughout the summer and fall. Climate change {{has the potential to}} alter current management operations based on recent indications of seasonal shifts in mountain watershed runoff. This study explores seasonal and multi-year operational sensitivities in the Shasta Reservoir watersheds and the sensitivities those shifts will have on critical stream habitats. Community Climate System Model 3 data developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research community will be used to generate runoff from 2000 - 2099 on the upper watershed of Shasta Reservoir. Four climate change scenarios, namely the A 1 B, A 2, B 1, and IPCC scenarios are selected for this study. Runoff patterns were routed through Shasta Reservoir and coupled with the Sacramento River Water Quality Model to quantify sensitivities in stream temperature. In the summer of 2037 and 2038, stream temperatures downstream from the dam were elevated above the suitable temperature threshold of 56 oF for all climate change scenarios. Stream temperatures were elevated at most by 2 oF. A more persistent six-year <b>dry</b> <b>cycle</b> from 2091 to 2096 also had great implications on stream temperatures. Stream temperatures downstream from the dam were elevated (at most 10 oF) above the suitable temperature threshold of 56 oF.

This suggested a hydrophobic structure formed during drying or plastic expansion of cell lumen due to steaming and soaking in DMSO. Although heat treatments reduced the hygroscopicity of the wood, steamed wood showed more swelling, i. e., lower dimensional stability than unheated and dry-heated wood. This is probably because steaming caused serious degradation of cell wall components, therefore loosening its fiber-reinforced structure restricting the swelling of the cell wall. When wood is exposed to alternate wetting and drying, steaming is not advisable because it may reduce the dimensional stability of the wood...|$|R

This work focuses on a cycle that relies on continuous cooling of the air under compression, followed by recuperation of residual exhaust heat, combustion and expansion. Ideal gases are modeled, with realistic values of efficiencies, air-to-fuel ratios and turbine-inlet temperatures.
