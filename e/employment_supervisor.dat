40|$|A {{successful}} Animal Science program produces graduates {{that are}} well-prepared to assume professional {{roles in the}} work force or to continue into post-graduate programs. This preparation requires skills and competencies as well as knowledge. Among others, the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR) Skills and Competencies include analytical/problem solving skills, personal characteristics, human relations skills, and leadership skills. In their final year, Animal Science students complete a required internship in an area of interest. Supervisor evaluations of these internships provide feedback on the skills and preparation of our students. Supervisors evaluate students in the areas of work performance, professional relationships, professional role, and general/overall. Mean scores for 59 students {{over the last five years}} ranged from 86 % to 96 % with an overall mean of 92 %. The only score that was significantly different from the overall mean was 86 % for “Initiative to identify needs and proposed solutions. ” This appears to be related to a lack of student confidence in their abilities. Of particular interest are the score of 95 % for “Would employ student in the future if an opportunity developed,” and the number of students (currently 33 %) that end their internships with an offer of <b>employment.</b> <b>Supervisor</b> evaluations provide an objective assessment of student skills and competencies and preparation for a professional role and indicate that Animal Science students are generally well-prepared.

40|$|Retention {{of public}} child welfare workers {{has been a}} {{recognized}} problem and a topic of interest among child welfare researchers for many years. However, findings in the literature are conflicting and the research is largely atheoretical. While many variables relevant to retention and turnover have been identified, the literature lacks explanation of how the variables are related. The goals of this study were, thus, twofold. The first objective was to build a conceptual model using qualitative data generated from interviews of child welfare workers, theoretical works, as well empirical research which might explain retention and turnover specifically {{in the field of}} child welfare. The second objective was to test the conceptual model using logistic regression techniques on a large quantitative sample (N= 1, 121). This study employs mixed methods and draws its data from a larger ongoing study, utilizing a voluntary sample of child welfare workers who have participated in a Title IV-E MSW program in the state of California, have completed their work obligation period, and have either chosen to remain in public child welfare (stayers) or leave (leavers). Results suggest that the conceptual model successfully identifies the complexity of the process that leads to retention and turnover behavior. Variables from three categories (individual, organizational, and response to job factors) are identified as predicting retention. Previous county <b>employment,</b> <b>supervisor</b> support, and client-related stress were all related to predicting retention. The implications of the study findings for social work education, agency practice, theory building and research are offered...|$|E

5000|$|In United States labor law, {{workplace}} {{sexual harassment}} can take two forms; either [...] "Quid pro quo" [...] harassment or hostile work environment harassment. [...] "Quid pro quo" [...] harassment takes place when a supervisor requires sex, sexual favors, or sexual contact from an employee/job candidate {{as a condition}} of their <b>employment.</b> Only <b>supervisors</b> who have the authority to make tangible employment actions (i.e. hire, fire, promote, etc.), can commit [...] "Quid pro quo" [...] harassment.

40|$|Les dispositifs d’aide à la réinsertion {{professionnelle}} des personnes souffrant de troubles psychiques sont peu étudiés en France bien que la littérature spécialisée souligne que ces dispositifs sont clés pour favoriser l’insertion en milieu ordinaire. Les objectifs de cette recherche étaient de décrire les rôles, tâches et compétences des conseillers d’insertion et des responsables d’unité de production qui accompagnent ce public vers le milieu ordinaire au sein des ESAT de transition Messidor. Une méthodologie qualitative a été retenue : 24 entretiens individuels et 7 groupes de discussion ont été menés auprès des deux types de professionnels de ces structures. Les résultats ont permis de définir {{la fonction}} de chaque accompagnant et une liste de 110 compétences pour les conseillers d’insertion et de 155  compétences pour les responsables de production. Ce binôme d’accompagnants complémentaires apporte un soutien à l’insertion en favorisant un changement de regard sur soi. Le conseiller d’insertion accompagne chaque travailleur à construire et réaliser un projet d’insertion, tout en assurant la liaison entre différents partenaires externes de la collectivité (ex. employeurs, équipe soignante). En parallèle, au quotidien, le responsable de production assure une formation dans un métier, propose des défis à relever, ce qui contribue à restaurer l’estime de soi professionnelle des personnes, facteur clé pour l’insertion en milieu ordinaire. Les implications cliniques de cette recherche concernent le recrutement, la formation et la supervision des personnels accompagnant vers l’emploi. Objectives Some {{programs have been}} developed in France for helping people with a psychiatric disability to get competitive employment, especially prevocational programs such as transitional social firms. However, these programs have not been studied until now. Studies on supported employment programs (evidence-based practices) conducted in other countries demonstrated that variation of work outcomes is due, among other factors, to employment specialists’ competencies. These results highlight the need for describing more specifically {{the work of the}} two professionals, <b>employment</b> counselors and <b>supervisors,</b> working in transitional social firms in order to better understand their role, tasks and competencies. Therefore, the objective of this study aims at describing the roles, tasks and competencies of these two professionals working in transitional social firms, to better understand how they support people with psychiatric disability for eventually obtaining competitive employment. Methods A qualitative method was used to describe roles, tasks and competencies of <b>employment</b> counselors and <b>supervisors</b> working in the transitional social firms of the Messidor’s association (7 regions). In sum, 24 individual interviews with <b>employment</b> counselors and <b>supervisors</b> of these social firms as well as 7 focus groups with the two types of professionals, were conducted. Results This study allowed to define the work of the two professionals (role and tasks) and a list of 110 competencies for employment counselors as well as 155 competencies for supervisors working in these transitional social firms, emerged from qualitative analyses. This “double support” has been defined as a complementary approach helping workers to change their own perceptions, becoming more confident in their work abilities, and thus helping them to gain competitive employment. On the one hand, the employment counselor supports each worker in developing strategies and actions to reach competitive employment, and put in place “job development skills” to coordinate his role with key stakeholders (e. g. psychiatrist, employers) involved in the work integration of people with severe mental disorders. On the other hand, the supervisor is following each worker all day long, training and helping them to overcome potential difficulties regarding the work to do, and building confidence and self-esteem in the workers under their supervision, which are all key elements to gain competitive employment. Conclusion Clinical implications are suggested regarding the recruitment of professionals working in transitional social firms, and thus improving work outcomes for people with a severe mental illness...|$|R
40|$|The {{findings}} of this study build on and extend previous research on factors that contribute to job satisfaction in public child welfare agencies. Because the study agency has stabilized its workforce, it provides a unique opportunity to examine other organizational and environmental factors that may make a more subtle, yet just as deleterious contribution to staff dissatisfaction. Based on survey responses from 927 respondents, five research questions were addressed: 1) How does job satisfaction compare to staff in other human service organizations nationally? 2. Are differences in staff characteristics related to job satisfaction? 3. Are there particular areas of job difficulty that predict job satisfaction? 4. Are there differences by job category in job satisfaction? 5. What staff or job-related factors predict job satisfaction overall? Study findings were consistent with others that have examined organizational dynamics, particularly role stressors, supervision, and performance recognition and rewards. Results indicate that length of <b>employment,</b> being a <b>supervisor,</b> and experiencing difficulties with working conditions, supervision, and the lack of external client resources predict the highest levels of job dissatisfaction. Implications for public child welfare organizations are discussed, including strategies for attending to those organizational factors that negatively affect employees' perceptions of organizational support.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to secure {{perceived}} judgments of immediate supervisors toward student employees and the student employment program at Ball State University. A secondary purpose was to compare perceived judgments of immediate supervisors relative to ten selected characteristics of college work-study student employees and regular student employees. A Student Employment Questionnaire was developed to supervisors of student employees. Two hundred and ninety-five individuals participated in the study. Response data from study participants indicated general satisfaction with the performance of student employees supervised. Supervisors expressed agreement that a training program for student employees was desirable while responses were about evenly divided on whether supervisors have adequate input into the evaluation of the student <b>employment</b> program. <b>Supervisors</b> expressed disagreement that a training program for supervisors is needed. No significant differences were discovered in judgments of immediate supervisors when comparing college work-study student employees gather data from the 513 individuals identified as immediate and regular student employees relative to ten hypotheses statements. It was concluded that good supervisory practices are essential to the success of student employment programs, student employment is a justified way of helping students attend college, and periodic evaluation of student employment programs should be made, involving student employees, immediate supervisors and administrators in the process. To insure dollars are effectively spent, screening of students for particular jobs, having written job descriptions, providing orientation to the job and evaluation and feedback to student employees must be accomplished. It was recommended that the study be replicated in other collegiate settings to compare findings and secure additional data. It was recommended that a study be conducted to secure judgments of student employees relative to supervisory practices and the total student employment program. It was further suggested that a supervisory handbook be developed by institutional personnel, incorporating the philosophy of the institution, the role of work in the educational setting and the shared judgments of supervisors of student employees. State and national organizations were urged to focus attention on the duties and responsibilities, role and importance of immediate supervisors during meetings and in journals and newsletters.

40|$|MBA - WBSThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} in an attempt to uncover the reason for the uneven pace of promotion for black African managers in the South African work place, Employment Equity Commission (2008). While many previous studies of the same subject focused on the executive management level, this study sought to include the lower levels of management. The {{study was conducted}} through in-depth, one-on-one interviews with twenty black African managers from large South African corporate companies, and their inputs were triangulated with input from six <b>supervisors</b> and six <b>employment</b> agents. The <b>supervisors</b> and agents were sampled to include both male and female white, Indian and coloured respondents. The study found that, while black African managers were technically competent, they were hamstrung by prejudice in the workplace, poor performance management, poor career planning and their inability to network effectively, especially with senior, white colleagues. The transformational legislation meant to help their career aspirations was also poorly enforced by the government and consequently indifferently implemented by the corporations. This left them without concrete developmental plans that would lead to measurable career progression. New negative trends included the perception of an afro-pessimistic media, diluted jobs, being surrounded and outnumbered, inequitable expectation, ethnic hierarchies of oppression, political coyness, double battery, room-for-one syndrome and acceleration to the abyss. A positive trend included the slow emergence of a one cosmopolitan culture among young managers across all racial lines which was beginning to blur previously-held stereotype...|$|R
5000|$|When Rhodesia was reconstituted {{as the new}} Republic of Zimbabwe in 1980, {{accompanied}} by the electoral triumph of leading black nationalist Robert Mugabe and his Zimbabwe African National Union, Coloureds numbered about 20,000. Mugabe won the country's first general elections held under a universal franchise, despite facing militant opposition from Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) {{and a number of}} minority parties. All Coloureds registered in the Rhodesian electoral system prior to December 31, 1979 were permitted to vote, and those that did so overwhelmingly endorsed the Rhodesian Front. As a conciliatory gesture Mugabe later nominated a leading member of the Coloured community, Joseph Culverwell, to the Zimbabwean senate. Nevertheless, ZANU's ascension was greeted with caution. During the bush war, black nationalists frequently decried Coloureds as having benefited unjustly from the colonial racial hierarchy, and those who attempted to join ZANU and ZAPU's guerrilla armies were often detained or executed as spies. Less educated, blue collar Coloured workers were also concerned they would face job displacement from an advancing black workforce once they lost the advantage of preferential <b>employment</b> by white <b>supervisors.</b> Others seemed convinced only blacks would benefit economically under Mugabe's rule, at the expense of themselves and other ethnic minorities.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to explore}} and understand how recent college graduates made meaning of their on-campus work experience. The author interviewed graduates from a private liberal arts institution regarding how their on-campus employment impacted their academic success, overall student experience, and beginning careers. The participants believed that supervisors arranging their work schedules for them when they began working, and the time management skills they developed because they worked, positively contributed to their academic success. They said they would not have studied more even if they had had more time. Solid work ethics got the participants to work, but, the relationships they developed kept them working. Through their on-campus employment the participants developed the transferrable skills of how to received feedback and how to deal with difficult situations. They also built self-confidence, developed patience, and enhanced their ability to be precise. The participants believed that those skills had helped them in their careers. Recommendations for practice include: encouraging students to start working as soon as they start college, arranging work schedules for them to decrease stress, working 8 - 19 hours per week, ensuring that students are not working alone all of the time, finding ways to increase job responsibility, ensuring that pay is comparable to that of off-campus <b>employment</b> and training <b>supervisors</b> of students in the importance of their role, how to supervise and how to mentor.

40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} how Australian {{boarding}} supervisors (particularly non-teachers) are defined in regards to employment. The practices of Queensland’s School X (real name withheld) are used {{as an example of}} the difficult issues involved – although whether this case study is repeated elsewhere in the industry would take further research. The paper illustrates that the <b>employment</b> of boarding <b>supervisors</b> is dealt with at a basic level by a modern award, however its provisions do not represent what occurs in practice. If there is no enterprise bargain which improves upon the award, two possible explanations are put forward to explain the difference between award conditions and practice. The first is that the contract between boarding supervisors may not be one of employment. Relevant case law regarding whether a person is an employee or independent contractor is examined, and when applied to a typical boarding situation, it is concluded that any contract should be one of employment. The second explanation is that there is no legal contract at all between boarding supervisors and a school. Drawing on School X’s example where supervisors were classed as ‘volunteers’, the paper examines what the legal effect of that term might be. It could be seen to be a denial of an intention to create legal relations, a critical element in contract formation. Again, important cases are analysed on the topic of intention, and applied to a boarding context. It is argued that given the objective circumstances of a typical agreement, there is an intention to create legal relations. In particular, a little known Queensland case involving the non-employment status of boarding supervisors, which may be the cause of the confusion, is critically examined to determine its usefulness in answering the issue. Finally, the implications of not classifying boarding supervisors as employees are briefly discussed...|$|R
