2500|$|Travelling {{the lands}} newly {{acquired}} from Poland in 1772, Austrian emperor Joseph II {{decided that the}} Greek Catholic clergy would be <b>ideal</b> <b>vehicles</b> for bringing about enlightened reform among the Ukrainian population. With this in mind he undertook major reforms designed to increase the status and educational level of the Ukrainian clergy in order {{to enable them to}} play the role he assigned for them. The Greek Catholic Church and its clergy was raised in status {{in order to make it}} legally equal in all respects to its Roman Catholic counterpart. The previously independent Basilian Order was subordinated to the Greek Catholic hierarchy. Ukrainian Catholic priests were granted stipends by the Austrian government, liberating them economically from the Polish nobles who were now prevented by the Austrians from interfering with them. Ukrainian priests were also allotted larger tracts of land that further contributed to an improvement in their financial situation. Whereas previously the Ukrainian priests had typically been taught by their fathers, the Austrians opened seminaries specifically for Ukrainian Catholic students in Vienna (1774) and Lviv (1783) that provided subsequent generations of priests with University-level education and a strong exposure to Western culture. The sons of priests who served in the bishop's administration were given the same rights to state offices as had the sons of nobles. As a result of the Austrian reforms of the late 18th century, the Ukrainian Catholic priests thus became the first large educated social class within the Ukrainian population in Galicia.|$|E

During the war, the Family would be making forays from the Bottomless Pit. Accordingly, the dune buggies the Family acquired, licitly and otherwise, were fitted, on Manson's inspiration, with machine gun mounts; while the men would drive, the girls would operate the guns.|$|E
50|$|These {{vehicles}} are usually only {{in countries where}} there are game reserves, usually in Africa. Common variations of vehicles converted for game viewers are the Land Rover Defender, Toyota LandCruiser 70 Series and other common off-road vehicles. These are the <b>ideal</b> <b>vehicles</b> as they are made to carry 9 passengers besides the ranger. This allows interaction and personalized attention during a game drive. The larger game lodges in the public game reserves like the Kruger National Park and Pilanesberg National Park in South Africa operate modified trucks which can seat 25 passengers.|$|E
5000|$|... “Editing a {{book can}} be very similar to curating a show.” As an {{independent}} curator, Lionel Bovier, JRP|Ringier's founder, always considered the exhibition as a medium which can take very different forms, even that of a book. The artists’ books of the 1960s, with their autonomous and democratic qualities, seemed to him the <b>ideal</b> <b>vehicles</b> for art projects. But the production modes typically used by Fluxus artists in the 1970s, the book’s materialization through collaborative processes, cheap reproduction techniques and circulation, were as much influential to his understanding of book making.|$|E

In the ensuing years, the project moved forward slowly, perhaps because broadcasters were too preoccupied with {{the challenges of the}} present and the future to their industry to be able to properly reflect on or to chronicle the past. But, all the while, a search was carried on to find the <b>ideal</b> <b>vehicle</b> with which to fulfill the mission.

Epimethean Information Systems are not designed in the conventional sense, but take their shape {{in response to the}} actions of the people that use them. They share a range of characteristics, including implicit communication between users, emergent structure, and self-organisation. The fact that structure in such systems arises out of a dialogic process means that they are potentially <b>ideal</b> <b>vehicles</b> for e-learning, combining high and low transactional distance (a measurement of the relative degree of structure and dialogue in an educational transaction) in a single environment as well as shaping themselves to the needs of a specific community...|$|E

We provide examples of such USB services and describe a general architecture for their implementation. The services are easy to deploy, because they can be extended to remote laptops without prior installation of new software, and well-suited for delivery through virtualization in a cloud infrastructure. While our examples target mostly the enterprise, USB services, especially virtualized ones, can easily be tailored to suit a broad set of consumer applications...|$|E
40|$|Male moths {{generally}} {{find their}} mates {{by following the}} females' pheromone plume to its source. A formulated copy of this message is used to regulate mating of many important pests, including pink bollworm Pectinophora gossypiella, oriental fruit moth Grapholita molesta and tomato pinworm Keiferia lycopersicella. How synthetic disruptant interrupts normal orientation is uncertain, but the most probable mechanisms invoke adaptation and habituation, competition between point sources of formulation and females, and a camouflage of a female's pheromone plume by the formulation. The efficacy of this technology is related principally to the motility of mated females into the area to be managed, the initial population levels of the pest, and the release characteristics of the formulation. In most cases, implementation of this technology necessitates a sophisticated monitoring and management program. Area-wide management schemes are <b>ideal</b> <b>vehicles</b> for using disruptants. -from Author...|$|E

40|$|Targeted Mobile Advertising (TMA) {{has emerged}} as a {{significant}} driver of the Internet economy. Such systems give rise to interesting challenges: {{there is a need to}} balance privacy and utility; there is a need to guarantee that applications' access to resources is appropriate; and there is a need to ensure that the targeting of ads is effective. As many authors have argued, formal models are <b>ideal</b> <b>vehicles</b> for reasoning about privacy, as well as for reasoning about the relationship between privacy and utility. To this end, we describe how the formal notation Z has been used to develop formal models to underpin a prototype privacypreserving TMA system. We give consideration to how formal models can help in underpinning the prototype system, in analysing privacy in the context of targeted mobile advertising, and in allowing users to specify control of their personal information...|$|E
30|$|Gold {{nanoparticles}} {{are unique}} nanomaterials {{that are easy}} to synthesize and modify. AuNPs have excellent optical properties that can be exploited for detection or photothermal applications. In addition, AuNPs accumulate in phagocytic cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, making them <b>ideal</b> <b>vehicles</b> for vaccine delivery. Here, we demonstrated a method to synthesize high-peptide density gold nanovaccines using a simple self-assembling bottom-up strategy. Changes in the absorbance spectra and TEM images show successful peptide conjugation onto PEGylated AuNPs. Calculating from the conjugation yield of 90 %, each particle can carry up to 1, 300 peptides. Moon et al.[27] reported liposomal formulations to have an encapsulation efficiency of 200 to 350 μg OVA/mg of particles and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) formulations to have 50 μg OVA/mg of particles, while AuNVs correlate to roughly 500 μg of OVA peptide per milligram of AuNVs. Considering that gold also has a higher density than liposomal or polymeric formulations, the amount of peptide carried by AuNVs is much higher than that by other nanomaterials.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: As the {{phenotype}} {{of adult}} dermal stem cells is still elusive, and the {{hematopoietic stem cell}} {{is one of the}} best-characterized stem cells in the body, we tested dermal cell suspensions, sections, and wholemounts in newborn and adult mice for hematopoietic stem cell marker expression. Phe-notypic analysis revealed that a small population of CD 45 cells and a large population of CD 45 – cells expressed CD 34, CD 117, and stem cell antigen- 1 molecules. When cultivated in selected media sup-plemented with hematopoietic cytokines, total der-mal cells, lineage–, and/or highly enriched pheno-typically defined cell subsets produced hematopoi-etic and nonhematopoietic colonies. When injected into lethally irradiated recipient mice, a small per-centage of newborn dermal cells was able to mi-grate into hematopoietic tissues and the skin and survived through the 11 -month monitoring period. Our ability to isolate a candidate autologous stem cell pool will make these cells <b>ideal</b> <b>vehicles</b> for genetic manipulation and gene therapy. J. Leukoc...|$|E
