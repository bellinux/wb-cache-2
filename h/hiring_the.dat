5|$|Containing autobiographical themes, a {{majority}} of the album's lyrics came {{as the result of a}} series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, <b>hiring</b> <b>the</b> A executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization. It has also been regarded as a template upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers, particularly black women.|$|E
5|$|From 1895 to 1899, William Wurtenburg {{served as}} the {{head coach of the}} Dartmouth Big Green {{football}} program, which represented Dartmouth College in collegiate football competitions. Dartmouth had adopted football as a school sport in 1881 when the team went 1–0–1. Prior to Wurtenburg's <b>hiring,</b> <b>the</b> team had won two consecutive Triangular Football League championships under coach Wallace Moyle. Wurtenburg had been a highly successful player at Yale, where he had played at quarterback on teams that went 46–1–1 in a four-year span. He had graduated from the school in 1893 and coached the Navy Midshipmen football program for a year before his hiring by Dartmouth.|$|E
5|$|After nearly 30 {{years of}} {{struggling}} with funding and pursuing various deals, William Beardsley hired engineer Carl Pleasant {{to assist with}} designing. Pleasant recommended <b>hiring</b> <b>the</b> engineer firm Peckham and James to draft plans for the storage dam at the Frogs Tank site. The gravity dam design was dropped, and a relatively new, cheaper and improved but controversial design was adopted: the multiple-arch buttress dam. In 1925, under a new state law, Beardsley was able to create the Beardsley-Agua Fria Water Conservation District. Under the new district, funds could be raised through a bond issue. On December 20, 1925, the construction contract was signed, but the bonds {{had yet to be}} purchased. Five days before the contract was signed, Beardsley died. His son, Robert took direction of the project along with Pleasant. In early 1926, Pleasant eventually sold the needed bonds to the New York firm Brandon, Gordon and Waddell. The firm sent Donald Ware Waddell to oversee construction.|$|E

5|$|In March 2005, Mesa resigned, {{citing the}} {{pressure}} of Morales and the cocalero road blocks and riots. Amid fears of civil war, Eduardo Rodríguez became President of a transitional government, preparing Bolivia for a general election in December 2005. <b>Hiring</b> <b>the</b> Peruvian Walter Chávez as its campaign manager, the MAS electoral campaign was based on Salvador Allende's successful campaign in the Chilean presidential election, 1970. Measures were implemented to institutionalize the party structure, giving it greater independence from the social movement; this was done to allow Morales and other MAS leaders to respond quickly to new developments without the lengthy process of consulting the bases, and to present a more moderate image away from the bases' radicalism. Although he had initially hoped for a female running mate, Morales eventually chose Marxist intellectual Álvaro García Linera as his Vice Presidential candidate, with some Bolivian press speculating as to a romantic relationship between the two. MAS' primary opponent was Jorge Quiroga and his center-right Social and Democratic Power, whose campaign was centered in Santa Cruz and which advocated continued neo-liberal reform; Quiroga accused Morales of promoting the legalization of cocaine and being a puppet for Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|The new league {{began on}} 12 September 2003 when Sheffield Steelers, {{who went on}} to become the inaugural league champions, {{defeated}} the newly formed London Racers 6–1 at Alexandra Palace. The Racers endured a difficult first season, moving to a different rink only weeks into the season and having to wait 40 games to record a win, a 3–0 victory over Cardiff Devils. The Racers finished the season with 10 points, 38 points behind second bottom Basingstoke. The other new team, Manchester Phoenix fared slightly better, qualifying for the playoff finals after finishing sixth in the league, where they were defeated 6–1 by Nottingham in the semi final. The club played at the 17,500 capacity MEN Arena which had been home to Manchester Storm, but Phoenix crowds averaged 2,250, well below the break-even mark of 3,000. Late in the season, Phoenix choose to play a game at IceSheffield rather than pay the considerable cost of <b>hiring</b> <b>the</b> arena for a mid-week game (which usually had lower attendances). In the close season they allowed fans to vote on the option of either suspending playing operations while a new rink was constructed or playing in exile away from Manchester while a new rink was built. Supporters opted to suspend playing operations pending the construction of a new facility.|$|E

30|$|The {{secretary}} problem, {{also known}} as the dowry problem, is a well-studied sequential decision problem involving optimal stopping theory. The secretary problem in its simplest form is as follows (Ferguson 1989). Suppose a manager wishes to fill a secretarial position. There is only one such position available, for which there are N applicants. The manager is aware of the number of applicants. We assume the applicants can be rank-ordered from best to worst candidates without ties. The applicants are then interviewed sequentially and in a random fashion. Once an applicant is interviewed, the manager is required to make a decision to <b>hire</b> <b>the</b> applicant or not. If <b>the</b> applicant is <b>hired,</b> no further interviews takes place. However if the applicant is not <b>hired,</b> <b>the</b> decision maker interviews the next candidate. Rejected applicants cannot be recalled. The objective of the manager is to <b>hire</b> <b>the</b> best possible applicant. After each interview, the manager faces a trade-off, i.e., <b>the</b> manager could <b>hire</b> <b>the</b> current interviewee and risk the chance that a better applicant would have arrived later on in the interview process, or not <b>hire</b> <b>the</b> current interviewee but no higher quality applicant arrives later.|$|R
