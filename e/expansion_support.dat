30|$|It was {{suggested}} that the relatively large changes of thermal expansion previously reported {{may be due to}} porosity or impurity at grain boundary rather than the small grain size [31]. Our experimental results in linear thermal <b>expansion</b> <b>support</b> this point of view. It is normally considered that the grain boundary have an enhanced thermal expansion in comparison with that of crystallite due to their excess volume [21]. Many preparation techniques, such as inert gas condensation, ball-milling, and magnetron-sputtering, changed the state of materials, such as bulk → powder → bulk or thin film and powder → bulk during nanocrystallization processes. Many NC materials have a considerable amount of entrained porosity, which was introduced during nanocrystallization processes. The porosity in NC materials may drastically alter results for the thermal expansion and, therefore, impair measurement reliability and accuracy. In fact, the thermal expansions of NC materials were found {{to be sensitive to the}} mode of preparation and their consequent time–temperature history [17, 30 – 32]. However, the densities, state and compositions of NC materials by severe rolling technique were not changed and their microstructures of grain boundary were continuously changed with porosity free at grain boundary during the whole preparation processes. This is the reason why the grain boundary did less contribution to the thermal expansion of BNII.|$|E

40|$|Georgia’s {{principal}} state-level {{economic development}} tax incentive {{program has been}} a set of income tax credits known as Georgia’s BEST program. Shortly after taking office in January 1999, Governor Barnes requested a study of BEST that would {{serve as the basis}} for recommending changes to it. An extensive review and evaluation of all aspects of BEST was conducted, including the effect of job tax credits on job creation. The authors found that most eligible firms did not participate in BEST, that the job tax credit created jobs, and that there were many problems with the structure of BEST. Numerous changes were proposed that were intended to better target the tax credits and to address development objectives beyond just job creation. Many of the authors’ recommendations were taken by the governor and effected statutory changes to BEST. Based on lessons that were learned or reinforced, 10 recommendations for others involved in similar projects are presented. The increase in interstate competition for jobs has led to an increase in the number of states with economic development incentive programs and in the aggressiveness of existing programs. Geor-gia’s principal state-level economic development tax incentive program has been a set of tax cred-its known as Georgia’s BEST program, which was established by the Business <b>Expansion</b> <b>Support</b> Act of 1994 and its subsequent amendments. Shortly after taking office in January 1999, Governor Roy Barnes was asked to recommend modifications to BEST. He declined to do so until he could have a study conducted regarding the performance of BEST; he wanted to know if BEST was effec-tive and how it might be improved. In the summer of 1999, he asked the Fiscal Research Program in the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University to conduct such a study.
