40|$|Objectives. To {{examine and}} {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} shea nut oil extract (SheaFlex 75) in relation to knee osteoarthritis (OA). Methods. Thirty-three patients (age 63. 6 ± 5. 8 years) with knee OA were recruited. Real-time ultrasound imaging and surface electromyography were used to objectively assess the morphological changes and the activity of vastus medialis oblique (VMO) muscles during a 16 -week intervention of SheaFlex 75. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to examine {{the reliability of the}} <b>interscans.</b> A paired-sample t-test was used to compare the findings in different stages. The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used {{to examine the relationship between}} the relevant variables of OA and percentage of thickness change of VMO at different contraction levels. Results. The baseline findings showed strong correlation, suggesting that the reliability of <b>interscans</b> at pretest was high. The ability to contract the muscles of the knee to a 30 % contraction level showed significant change between the baseline and after 16 -week testing, both in terms of morphological changes and muscle activity.

The results suggest that SheaFlex 75 can relieve the symptoms of knee OA and can result in improvement of muscle control of the knee...|$|R
40|$|International audienceForaging animals often {{raise their}} head to scan for predators. Scanning {{intervals}} have variable durations, and occur {{more or less}} frequently, depending on ecological conditions. Our study relies {{on the assumption that}} temporal patterns of vigilance depend on the speed with which information concerning the likelihood of a predator's presence in the neighbourhood is gathered when an animal is vigilant, and lost when it is not. Using an analytical model, we study how the perceived level of risk progressively decreases, when the individual is vigilant and detects no predator, then increases again, when it lowers its head to feed, thereby losing most of its detection abilities. The speed of these variations is affected by the likelihood of the presence of a predator in the whole environment, by the mobility of this predator, and by the detection capacities of the prey. We show how, combined with the range of risk levels tolerated by this animal, this dynamics determines the frequency and the duration of its scanning intervals. The dynamics of risk perception can also explain particular behavioural patterns, such as the progressive decrease of vigilance that may occur after the arrival into a novel environment, and the central tendency in the distribution of inter scan durations reported by many studies. Next, we use the model to compute optimal vigilance strategies, taking into account the trade-off between feeding and limiting exposure to predators. The model predicts that a forager will scan more often, and for longer periods, when the likelihood of a predator's presence in the surrounding environment is increased. A similar response is expected when the mobility of the predator is increased. By contrast, when the detection capacities of the prey are reduced, it will increase its vigilance by scanning for longer periods, but scanning intervals will be separated by longer <b>interscans...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{previous}} studies detection of coronary artery calcification (CAC) with low-dose ungated MDCT performed for lung cancer screening {{has been compared}} with detection with cardiac CT. We evaluated the <b>interscan</b> agreement of CAC scores from two consecutive low-dose ungated MDCT examinations. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The subjects were 584 participants in the screening segment of a lung cancer screening trial who underwent two low-dose ungated MDCT examinations within 4 months (mean, 3. 1 +/- 0. 6 months) of a baseline CT examination. Agatston score, volume score, and calcium mass score were measured by two observers. <b>Interscan</b> agreement of stratification of participants into four Agatston score risk categories (0, 1 - 100, 101 - 400, > 400) was assessed with kappa values. <b>Interscan</b> variability and 95 % repeatability limits were calculated for all three calcium measures and compared by repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: An Agatston score > 0 was detected in 443 baseline CT examinations (75. 8 %). <b>Interscan</b> agreement of the four risk categories was good (kappa = 0. 67). The Agatston scores {{were in the same}} risk category in both examinations in 440 cases (75. 3 %); 578 participants (99. 0 %) had scores differing a maximum of one category. Furthermore, mean <b>interscan</b> variability ranged from 61 % for calcium volume score to 71 % for Agatston score (p < 0. 01). A limitation of this study was that no comparison of CAC scores between low-dose ungated CT and the reference standard ECG-gated CT was performed. CONCLUSION: Cardiovascular disease risk stratification with low-dose ungated MDCT is feasible and has good <b>interscan</b> agreement of stratification of participants into Agatston score risk categories. High mean <b>interscan</b> variability precludes the use of this technique for monitoring CAC scores for individual patients...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{assess the}} intra- and <b>interscan</b> {{reproducibility}} of LV twist using FAST. Assessing the reproducibility of {{the measurement of}} new MRI biomarkers {{is an important part}} of validation. Fourier Analysis of STimulated Echoes (FAST) is a new MRI tissue tagging method that has recently been shown to compare favorably with conventional estimates of left ventricular (LV) twist from cardiac tagged images, but with significantly reduced user interaction time. Materials and Methods Healthy volunteers (N = 10) were scanned twice using FAST over 1 week. On day 1, two measurements of LV twist were collected for intrascan comparisons. Measurements for LV twist were again collected on day 8 for <b>interscan</b> assessment. LV short-axis tagged images were acquired on a 3 Tesla (T) scanner to ensure detectability of tags during early and mid-diastole. Peak LV twist is reported as mean ± SD. Reproducibility was assessed using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and the repeatability coefficient (RC) (95 % confidence interval [CI] range). Results Mean peak twist measurements were 13. 4 ± 4. 3 ° (day 1, scan 1), 13. 6 ± 3. 7 ° (day 1, scan 2), and 13. 0 ± 2. 7 ° (day 8). Bland-Altman analysis resulted in intra- and <b>interscan</b> bias and 95 % CI of - 0. 6 ° [- 1. 0 °, 1. 6 °] and 1. 4 ° (- 1. 0 °, 3. 0 °), respectively. The Bland-Altman RC for peak LV twist was 2. 6 ° and 4. 0 ° for intra- and <b>interscan,</b> respectively. The CCC was 0. 9 and 0. 6 for peak LV twist for intra- and <b>interscan,</b> respectively. Conclusion FAST is a semi-automated method that provides a quick and quantitative assessment of LV systolic and diastolic twist that demonstrates high intrascan and moderate <b>interscan</b> reproducibility in preliminary studies.

40|$|International {{audience}} In group-forming prey species, theory {{assumes that}} individuals within groups should scan independently of one another, with vigilance sequences being relatively unpredictable, making <b>interscan</b> durations highly variable. We attempted to detect any divergence from randomness in the scanning process in three mammalian prey species phylogenetically and geographically separated and exposed to {{different levels of}} predation: waterbuck, Kobus ellipsiprymnus defassa, under a high observed predation risk, eastern grey kangaroo, Macropus giganteus, still experiencing occasional predation and European roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, under a very low natural predation risk. Our results revealed that the focal <b>interscan</b> duration increased when {{the duration of the}} preceding <b>interscan</b> increased, whatever the studied species and the predation risk that its individuals experienced, and decreased with the preceding scan duration in two species under, respectively, occasional and low predation risks. The exponential distribution was the tested model that fitted the observed distributions of <b>interscan</b> durations least well. We discuss what can trigger non-randomness in scanning, through a non-homogenous Poisson process, at both intra-individual and inter-individual levels, particularly with regard to previous studies that have demonstrated synchronisation of vigilance in such mammals. Our results suggest the need to reconsider any assumption of randomness in scanning in the basic model predicting form and frequency of scanning behaviour by prey species. </p...|$|E
40|$|In PET {{activation}} studies, linear {{changes in}} regional {{cerebral blood flow}} {{may be caused by}} subject <b>interscan</b> displacements rather than by changes in cognitive state. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the impact of these artifacts and to assess whether they can be removed by applying a scan-specific calculated attenuation correction (CAC) instead of the default measured attenuation correction (MAC). Two independent data sets were analyzed, one with large (data I) and one with small (data II) <b>interscan</b> displacements. After attenuation correction (CAC or MAC), data were analyzed using SPM 99. <b>Interscan</b> displacement parameters (IDP), obtained during scan realignment, were included as additional regressors in the General Linear Model and their impact was assessed by variance statistics revealing the affected brain volume. For data I, this volume reduced dramatically from 579 to 12 cm(3) (approximately 50 -fold) at P-uncorr less than or equal to 0. 001 and from 100 to 0 cm(3) at P-corr less than or equal to 0. 05 when CAC was applied instead of MAC. Surprisingly, for data II, applying CAC instead of MAC still resulted in a substantial (approximately 10 -fold) reduction of the affected volume from 23 to 2 cm(3) at P-uncorr less than or equal to 0. 001. We conclude that <b>interscan</b> displacement-induced variance can be prevented by applying a (realigned attenuation correction scan (e. g., CAC). With MAC data, introducing IDP covariates is not an alternative since they model only this variance. Even in data with minor <b>interscan</b> displacements, applying a (realigned attenuation correction method (e. g., CAC) is superior to a nonaligned MAC with IDP covariates.

From a lung cancer screening trial all SSNs that were stable over at least 3 months were included (N = 44). SSNs were quantified on the baseline CT by two observers using semi-automatic volumetry software for effective diameter, volume, and mass. One observer also measured the SSNs on the second CT 3 months later. <b>Interscan</b> variation was evaluated using Bland-Altman plots. Observer agreement was calculated as intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Data are presented as mean (+/- standard deviation) or median and interquartile range (IQR). A Mann-Whitney U test {{was used for the}} analysis of the influence of adjustments on the measurements. Semi-automatic measurements were feasible in all 44 SSNs. The <b>interscan</b> limits of agreement ranged from - 12. 0 % to 9. 7 % for diameter, - 35. 4 % to 28. 6 % for volume and - 27. 6 % to 30. 8 % for mass. Agreement between observers was good with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0. 978, 0. 957, and 0. 968 for diameter, volume, and mass, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUNDAND PURPOSE: The chronic {{cerebrospinal}} {{venous insufficiency}} hypothesis raises interest in cerebrospinal venous blood flow imaging, {{which is more}} complex and less established than in arteries. For accurate assessment of venous flow in chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency diagnosis and research, we must account for physiologic changes in flow patterns. This study examines day-to-day flow variability in cerebrospinal veins by use of 4 DMR flow and contrast-enhancedMRA under typical, uncontrolled conditions in healthy individuals. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were scanned in a test-retest fashion by use of a 4 D flowMR imaging technique and contrast-enhanced MRA. Flow parameters obtained from phase contrast-vastly undersampled isotropic projection reconstruction and contrast-enhanced MRA scoring measurements in the head, neck, and chest veins were analyzed for internal consistency and <b>interscan</b> reproducibility. RESULTS: Internal consistency was satisfied at the torcular herophili, with an input-output difference of 2. 2 %. Percentages of variations in flow were 20. 3 %, internal jugular vein; 20. 4 %, azygos vein; 6. 8 %, transverse sinus; and 5. 1 %, common carotid artery.

40|$|To {{study the}} <b>interscan</b> {{reproducibility}} of manual versus automated segmentation of carotid artery plaque components, and the agreement between both methods, in high and lower quality MRI scans. 24 patients with 30 - 70 % carotid artery stenosis were planned for 3 T carotid MRI, {{followed by a}} rescan within 1 month. A multicontrast protocol (T 1 w,T 2 w, PDw and TOF sequences) was used. After co-registration and delineation of the lumen and outer wall, segmentation of plaque components (lipid-rich necrotic cores (LRNC) and calcifications) was performed both manually and automated. Scan quality was assessed using a visual quality scale. Agreement {{for the detection of}} LRNC (Cohen's kappa (k) is 0. 04) and calcification (k = 0. 41) between both manual and automated segmentation methods was poor. In the high-quality scans (visual quality score ≥ 3), the agreement between manual and automated segmentation increased to k = 0. 55 and k = 0. 58 for, respectively, the detection of LRNC and calcification larger than 1 mm 2. Both manual and automated analysis showed good <b>interscan</b> reproducibility for the quantification of LRNC (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0. 94 and 0. 80 respectively) and calcified plaque area (ICC of 0. 95 and 0. 77, respectively).

40|$|To determine, in three-dimensions, the {{difference}} between prostate delineation in magnetic resonance (MR) and computer tomography (CT) images for radiotherapy treatment planning. Three radiation oncologists, considered experts in the field, outlined the prostate without seminal vesicles both on CT, and axial, coronal, and sagittal MR images for 18 patients. To compare the resulting delineated prostates, the CT and MR scans were matched in three-dimensions using chamfer matching on bony structures. The volumes were measured and the <b>interscan</b> and interobserver variation was determined. The spatial difference between delineation in CT and MR (<b>interscan</b> variation) {{as well as the}} interobserver variation were quantified and mapped three-dimensionally (3 D) using polar coordinates. A urethrogram was performed and the location of the tip of the dye column was compared with the apex delineated in CT and MR images. <b>Interscan</b> variation: CT volumes were larger than the axial MR volumes in 52 of 54 delineations. The average ratio between the CT and MR volumes was 1. 4 (standard error of mean, SE: 0. 04) which was significantly different from 1 (p < 0. 005). Only small differences were observed between the volumes outlined in the various MR scans, although the coronal MR volumes were smallest. The CT derived prostate was 8 mm (standard deviation, SD: 6 mm) larger {{at the base of the}} seminal vesicles and 6 mm (SD 4 mm) larger at the apex of the prostate than the axial MRI. Similar figures were obtained for the CT and the other MRI scans. Interobserver variation: The average ratio between the volume derived by one observer for a particular scan and patient and the average volume was 0. 95, 0. 97, and 1. 08 (SE 0. 01) for the three observers, respectively. The 3 D pattern of the overall observer variation (1 SD) for CT and axial MRI was similar and equal to 3. 5 to 2. 8 mm at the base of the seminal vesicles and 3 mm at the apex.
