25|$|Henry was in France {{with the}} Emperor Maximilian at {{the siege of}} Thérouanne. The Scottish Lyon King of Arms brought James IV's letter of 26 July to him. James asked him to desist from attacking France in breach of their treaty. Henry's {{exchange}} with Islay Herald or the Lyon King on 11 August at his tent at the siege was recorded. The Herald declared that Henry should abandon his efforts against the town and go home. Angered, Henry said that James {{had no right to}} summon him, and ought to be England's ally, as James was married to his (Henry's) sister, Margaret. He declared:And now, for a conclusion, recommend me to your master and tell him if he be so hardy to invade my realm or cause to enter one foot of my ground I shall make him as weary of his part as ever was man that began any such business. And one thing I ensure him by the faith that I have to the Crown of England and by the word of a King, there shall never King nor Prince make peace with me that ever his part shall be in it. Moreover, fellow, <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> nothing but for misentreating of my sister, that would God she were in England on a condition she cost the Schottes King not a penny.|$|E
500|$|She {{then went}} out on a rainy night and [...] "to make her clothes heavy with water, she {{walked up and down}} about half an hour" [...] before jumping into the River Thames, but a {{stranger}} saw her jump and rescued her. Wollstonecraft considered her suicide attempt deeply rational, writing after her rescue, I have only to lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination is not to be baffled by disappointment; nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt, {{which was one of the}} calmest acts of reason. In this respect, I am only accountable to myself. Did <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> what is termed reputation, it is by other circumstances that I should be dishonoured.|$|E
500|$|David Browne of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album a B+. Browne said, [...] "Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed {{instruments}} both acoustic and electric." [...] He praised several songs as being [...] "as powerful as anything the band has done." [...] Browne criticized the album's production, saying [...] "like many self-produced efforts, it shows." [...] He added, [...] "With arrangements that crest and {{fall to the}} point where a road map would have helped, the overlong (16-song) album is often unwieldy and could have benefited from judicious trimming." [...] Allmusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars, saying that [...] "it might seem like nothing more than heavy metal, but a closer listen reveals that Soundgarden haven't tempered their ambitions at all." [...] The reviewer for Melody Maker said that [...] "their roots don't matter now. All <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> now is the immediacy of their pop moments." [...] Critic Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention of one star, describing it as [...] "brutal depression simplified" [...] and highlighted by the songs [...] "Ty Cobb" [...] and [...] "Applebite", while Jason Josephes from Pitchfork Media called it a [...] "double shot of grunge, no foam but plenty of caffeine." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. G. And <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> him--and <b>I</b> didn't--and {{then you}} came--and <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> you very, very much indeed. That's all. (Face hidden.) You aren't angry, are you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} have told me," [...] Tommy said, staring into her face, [...] "if you had thought <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> you. Had you thought <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> you a little jot--" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{remained}} {{silent for a}} while, and then boldly answered. [...] "Though <b>I</b> do not <b>care</b> <b>for</b> Lady Arabella, <b>I</b> do <b>care</b> <b>for</b> Mr Gresham:--and <b>I</b> do <b>care</b> <b>for</b> his son." ...|$|R
2500|$|Montreal Mayor Gérald Tremblay stated [...] "This is so tragic. How do {{we talk to}} {{the parents}} who are going through this? All I {{can say is that}} I feel for them, and <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nel Noddings {{draws an}} {{important}} distinction between natural caring and ethical caring (1984, 81-83). Noddings distinguishes between acting because [...] "I want" [...] and acting because [...] "I must". When <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> someone because [...] "I want" [...] to care, say I hug a friend who needs hugging {{in an act of}} love, Noddings claims that I am engaged in natural caring. When <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> someone because [...] "I must" [...] care, say I hug an acquaintance who needs hugging in spite of my desire to escape that person's pain, according to Noddings, I am engaged in ethical caring. Ethical caring occurs when a person acts caringly out of a belief that caring is the appropriate way of relating to people. When someone acts in a caring way because that person naturally cares for another, the caring is not ethical caring (1984, 79-80). Noddings' claims that ethical caring is based on, and so dependent on, natural caring (1984, 83, 206 fn 4). It is through experiencing others caring for them and naturally caring for others that people build what is called an [...] "ethical ideal", an image of the kind of person they want to be.|$|E
2500|$|Regine {{had also}} made a strong {{impression}} on Kierkegaard, who began to pursue her {{over a long period}} of time, ingratiating himself first as a friend and later attempting to court her. [...] On 8 September 1840, Kierkegaard finally revealed his feelings to Regine when she was playing the piano for him at her family's house. [...] He recounted the events years later in his journal: [...] "'Oh! [...] What do <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> music, it's you I want, I have wanted you for two years.' [...] She kept silent." [...] Kierkegaard proceeded to plead his case to Etatsraad (Councilman) Olsen, Regine's father, immediately. [...] Her father granted Kierkegaard his blessing, and the two became engaged to be married.|$|E

6000|$|... "It was {{not that}} <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> the stupid stones. You know that <b>I</b> <b>care</b> nothing <b>for</b> {{anything}} of the kind. But there {{was a sort of}} trust in it,--a desire to show me that everything should be mine,--which would have made me love him,--if it had been possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Me? <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> several things. <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> my wife. <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> love. And I {{care to be}} loved.

6000|$|... "That {{makes it}} all the worse. Do you think <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> her only? It's Kendricks too that <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for.</b> I don't know that <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> her at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't believe <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> Miss Lynde {{any more}} than <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> you. But I believe I wish you {{were not going to}} break with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I'm sick of your {{temper and}} your jealousy. <b>I</b> don't <b>care</b> <b>for</b> you, <b>I</b> never have <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> you, and <b>I</b> never shall <b>care</b> <b>for</b> you. <b>I</b> don't {{want to have}} {{anything}} more to do with you." ...|$|R
60|$|Now {{that she}} should think <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> Patty never entered my head. I was thrown all in a heap.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly. That is {{just what}} he says. But, Mrs. Clavering, <b>I</b> <b>care</b> nothing <b>for</b> that. <b>I</b> <b>care</b> nothing <b>for</b> what any body says or thinks. What is it to me what they say?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, you do. You {{know there}} isn't any one that <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> one-tenth part {{as much as}} <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> you. I didn't go up the lake this {{afternoon}} because I particularly wanted to; and those people came here of their own accord." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not that <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> you," [...] he said, with a {{suppressed}} {{tone that}} made his voice so deep! [...] "Not that <b>I</b> <b>cared,</b> but that Lord Torwood did--Torwood is the baby upstairs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{you have}} not? Just so. You confirm my own impression. Does that {{look as if}} <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> her? <b>I</b> ask, for information.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The captain made {{no answer}} to these words, and {{did not appear to}} hear them. [...] "I tell you, Mr. Easterfield," [...] he said presently, [...] "that I did not know until now how much <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> that girl. <b>I</b> don't mind saying this to you because you come to me like a friend, and I believe in you. Yes, sir, I did not know how much <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> her, and it is pretty hard on me to find out how little she <b>cares</b> <b>for</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I do," [...] said Philip, rather sadly; [...] "but I {{think of}} too many things,--sow all sorts of seeds, and get no great harvest from any one of them. I'm cursed with {{susceptibility}} in every direction, and effective faculty in none. <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> painting and music; <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> classic literature, and mediæval literature, and modern literature; I flutter all ways, and fly in none." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If I {{suspect and}} {{distrust}} you, {{it is your}} own fault," [...] Francis reminded him. [...] "You have declared yourself to be a criminal {{and a friend of}} criminals. I am inclined to believe that you have spoken the truth. <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> that fact just as little as <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> {{the fact that you are}} a millionaire, or that Margaret has been married to a murderer. I intend her to become my wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{know now}} how it was, {{and it makes}} you seem all the grander to me. Did you think <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> your being older than I was? <b>I</b> never <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> it--I never hardly thought of it after the very first. I tried to make you {{understand}} that, and how it hurt me to have you speak of it. Don't you think that I could see how good you were? Do you suppose that all I want is to be happy? <b>I</b> don't <b>care</b> <b>for</b> that--I despise it, and I always hate myself for seeking my own pleasure, if I find myself doing it. I have seen enough of life to know what that comes to! And what hurt me worst of all was that you seemed to believe that <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> nothing but amusing myself, when I wished to be something better, higher! It's nothing whether you are of my age or not, if--if--you <b>care</b> <b>for</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. ERLYNNE. [After a pause.] If I said to {{you that}} <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> her, perhaps loved her even--you would sneer at me, wouldn't you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't {{want any}} change," [...] said Eppie. [...] "I {{should like to}} go on a long, long while, just as we are. Only Aaron does want a change; and he made me cry a bit--only a bit--because he said <b>I</b> didn't <b>care</b> <b>for</b> him, <b>for</b> if <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> him <b>I</b> should want us to be married, as he did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'H'm!' said Torpenhow, 'can't say <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> Verestchagin-and-water myself, but there's no {{accounting}} for tastes. Doing anything now, are you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Paul frankly wondered. [...] "Why she has {{a passion}} for the real thing, for good work--for {{everything}} you and <b>I</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> most." ...|$|E
