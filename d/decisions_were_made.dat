5|$|From 1920 to 1957, three bodies, {{successively}} the Federal Capital Advisory Committee, the Federal Capital Commission, and the National Capital Planning and Development Committee {{continued to}} plan the further expansion of Canberra {{in the absence of}} Griffin; however, they were only advisory, and development <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> without consulting them, increasing inefficiency.|$|E
5|$|A new note in Coutances' {{administration}} was his custom of issuing writs {{not in his}} own name, as had previously been the practice, but in the king's name. The archbishop also stressed that his <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> with the advice and consent {{of many of the}} leading nobles of the realm, as well as the barons of the Exchequer. This was a reaction against Longchamp's authoritarian method of government.|$|E
5|$|In September 1277 King Ottokar II held in {{the border}} city of Opava a meeting of Polish princes. Sources doesn't specify either the exact date or the participants. Historians {{speculate}} only that they could be: Henryk IV Probus, Bolesław V the Chaste, Leszek II the Black, Władysław of Opole with his sons, Henry III of Głogów and Przemysł II. Several political <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> during the meeting, most notably military actions against Germany.|$|E
30|$|<b>Decision</b> epochs <b>are</b> {{the time}} points {{at which the}} <b>{{decision}}s</b> <b>are</b> <b>made.</b> In the MDP, the <b>decision</b> horizon <b>is</b> divided into M periods by decision epochs. If M <b>is</b> infinite, the <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> on an infinite horizon. Otherwise, the <b>decision</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> on a finite horizon if M is finite. It is generally assumed that <b>decisions</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> annually. That <b>is,</b> the <b>decision</b> period <b>is</b> 1  year and the <b>decision</b> epoch <b>is</b> {{the beginning of each}} year. Also, we assume that all maintenance actions are conducted {{at the beginning of each}} year.|$|R

5|$|There {{were two}} kinds of Red and White {{political}} violence: (i) a calculated {{part of the general}} warfare, (ii) local, personal murders and corresponding acts of revenge. In the former, the high staffs planned and organized the actions and gave orders to the lower level; at least a third of the Red terror and most of the White terror was centrally led. At first the Red and White governments officially opposed political violence, but the operational <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> at the military level.|$|E
5|$|Records {{from the}} Scandinavian-held lands are much-less well {{documented}} by comparison. Udal law {{formed the basis}} of the legal system and it is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland measure. Althings were open-air governmental assemblies that met {{in the presence of the}} jarl and the meetings were open to virtually all free men. At these sessions <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> <b>made,</b> laws passed and complaints adjudicated. Examples include Tingwall and Law Ting Holm in Shetland, Dingwall in Easter Ross, and Tynwald on the Isle of Man.|$|E
5|$|The Cubs {{began playing}} under the College of Coaches in 1961, {{a system in}} which <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> by a group of 12 coaches rather than by one manager. By the 1962 season, Banks hoped to return to shortstop but the College of Coaches had {{determined}} that he would remain at first base indefinitely. In May 1962, Banks was hit in the head by a fastball from former Cubs pitcher Moe Drabowsky and was taken off the field unconscious. He sustained a concussion, spent two nights in a hospital, sat out a Monday game, and hit three home runs and a double on Tuesday.|$|E

5|$|The General Court was {{the chief}} {{legislative}} and judicial body of the colony. It was elected by the freemen from among their own number and met regularly in Plymouth, the capital town of the colony. As part of its judicial duties, it would periodically call a Grand Enquest, which was a grand jury of sorts elected from the freemen, who would hear complaints and swear out indictments for credible accusations. The General Court, and later lesser town and county courts, would preside over trials of accused criminals and over civil matters, but the ultimate <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> by a jury of freemen.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's health worsened in {{the winter}} of 1981–82. In the meantime, the country was governed by Andrei Gromyko, Dmitriy Ustinov, Mikhail Suslov and Yuri Andropov while crucial Politburo <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> in his absence. While the Politburo was pondering the {{question}} of who would succeed, all signs indicated that the ailing leader was dying. The choice of the successor would have been influenced by Suslov, but he {{died at the age of}} 79 in January 1982. Andropov took Suslov's seat in the Central Committee Secretariat; by May, it became obvious that Andropov would try to make a bid for the office of the General Secretary. He, with the help of fellow KGB associates, started circulating rumours that political corruption had become worse during Brezhnev's tenure as leader, in an attempt to create an environment hostile to Brezhnev in the Politburo. Andropov's actions showed that he was not afraid of Brezhnev's wrath.|$|E
5|$|Cartledge {{pursued the}} claim anyway {{in an attempt}} to have the law changed, and <b>{{decision}}s</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> against him in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal. After the Court of Appeal decision a Committee on Limitation of Actions in Cases of Personal Injury was created under Mr Justice Davies, which produced its report before the Cartledge case had even got to the House of Lords. The report, published in September 1962, made several recommendations which found their way into a Limitation Bill placed before Parliament on 6 May 1963. While it was passing through the House of Lords, Lord Reid suggested it would be simpler to amend the Limitation Act 1939, but this was never acted on. The act received the Royal Assent on 31 July 1963 and came into force immediately.|$|E

5|$|As the French fleet was {{preparing}} to depart Brest, France in March 1781, several important <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> <b>made.</b> The West Indies fleet, led by the Rear-Admiral Comte François Joseph Paul de Grasse, after operations in the Windward Islands, was directed to go to Cap-Français (present-day Cap-Haïtien, Haiti) to determine what resources {{would be required to}} assist Spanish operations. Because of a lack of transports, France also promised six million livres to support the American war effort instead of providing additional troops. The French fleet at Newport was given a new commander, the Comte Jacques-Melchior de Barras Saint-Laurent. He was ordered to take the Newport fleet to harass British shipping off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, and the French army at Newport was ordered to combine with Washington's army outside New York. In orders that were deliberately not fully shared with General Washington, De Grasse was instructed to assist in North American operations after his stop at Cap-Français. The French Lieutenant-General Comte Jean-Baptiste de Rochambeau, was instructed to tell Washington that de Grasse might be able to assist, without making any commitment (Washington learned from John Laurens, stationed in Paris, that de Grasse had discretion to come north).|$|E
5|$|Present-day {{knowledge}} {{of the nature of}} Scots law before the eleventh century is largely speculative, with no surviving law codes from Scotland in this period, but it was probably a mixture of different legal traditions representing the different cultures inhabiting the land at the time, including British, Irish and Anglo-Saxon customs. The legal tract known as Laws of the Brets and Scots, probably compiled in the reign of David I, set out a system of compensation for injury and death based on ranks and the solidarity of kin groups. There were popular courts, the comhdhail, indicated by dozens of place names throughout eastern Scotland. In Scandinavian-held areas Udal law formed the basis of the legal system and it is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland measure. Althings were open-air governmental assemblies that met {{in the presence of the}} jarl, and the meetings were open to virtually all free men. At these sessions <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> <b>made,</b> laws passed and complaints adjudicated. Examples include Tingwall and Law Ting Holm in Shetland, Dingwall in Easter Ross, and Tynwald on the Isle of Man.|$|E

50|$|A {{noteworthy}} {{practice of}} Friends {{is that all}} administrative and business <b>decisions</b> must <b>be</b> <b>made</b> in a Meeting for Worship (church services). Thus Monthly Meetings, Area Meetings, Quarterly Meetings, Yearly Meetings and larger gatherings of Friends are all Meetings for Worship. <b>Decisions</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> prayerfully. <b>Decisions</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> by unanimity. Friends' unanimity {{should not be confused}} with a secular consensus. Friends' unanimity is spirit based and the finding of unanimity emerges from Friends worshiping together (see also Quaker decision-making).|$|R

25|$|In retrospect, {{very few}} {{questionable}} <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> concerning {{the execution of}} the campaign. For example, General Patton, the U.S. Third Army commander, potentially could have made his initial Rhine crossing north of Mainz and avoided the losses incurred crossing the Main. Further north the airborne landings during Operation Plunder in support of the 21st Army Group's crossing of the Rhine were probably not worth the risk. But these <b>decisions</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> in good faith and had little bearing on the ultimate outcome of the campaign. On the whole, Allied plans were excellent as demonstrated by how rapidly they met their objectives.|$|E
