5|$|As {{the factory}} bell rings, the {{cigarette}} girls emerge and exchange banter with {{young men in}} the crowd ("La cloche a sonné"). Carmen enters and sings her provocative habanera on the untameable nature of love ("L'amour est un oiseau rebelle"). The men plead with her to choose a lover, and after some teasing she throws a flower to Don José, who thus far has been ignoring her but is now annoyed by her <b>insolence.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rainivoninahitriniony's {{tenure as}} sole Prime Minister was short lived. His violent tendencies, {{irritability}} and <b>insolence</b> toward Rasoherina, {{in addition to}} lingering popular resentment over Rainivoninahitriniony's role in the violent end to Radama's rule, gradually turned {{the opinion of the}} nobles against him. As Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony attempted to counsel his brother, while simultaneously overseeing diplomatic and military efforts to re-pacify the agitated Sakalava and other peoples, who viewed the coup as an indication of weakening Merina control. The Prime Minister repaid these efforts by repeatedly castigating high-ranking officers and even threatening Rainilaiarivony with his sword.|$|E
5|$|The {{children}} {{were put into}} {{the care of a}} nanny, as was usual in upper-class families at the time. The first nanny was dismissed for <b>insolence</b> and the second for abusing the children. This second woman, anxious to suggest that the children preferred her to anyone else, would pinch Edward and Albert whenever they were about to be presented to their parents so that they would start crying and be speedily returned to her. On discovery, she was replaced by her effective and much-loved assistant, Charlotte Bill.|$|E

5|$|The testimonies of the {{boatswain}} Cole, {{the carpenter}} Purcell, and the sailing master John Fryer were not unfavourable towards Heywood. However, Thomas Hayward's declared belief that Heywood {{was with the}} mutineers was damaging, as was the evidence of John Hallett concerning Heywood's alleged <b>insolence</b> in laughing and {{turning away from the}} captive Bligh—though Hallett had previously written to Nessy Heywood professing total ignorance of the part Heywood had played in the mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Viswanathan (T. S. Balaiah) is an arrogant, money-minded {{estate owner}} {{who lives in}} a {{bungalow}} called Chinnamalai Estate near Pollachi. His son Chellappa (Nagesh) is an aspiring filmmaker; Chellappa is the antithesis of his father and voices his displeasure at his father's arrogance. Viswanathan also has two daughters; Kanchana (Kanchana) and Nirmala (Rajasree). Kanchana is in love with her college mate Vasu (R. Muthuraman), the son of a rich Chennai-based businessman Sachidanandam (V. S. Raghavan). The sisters return home after completing their education in Chennai. One day while out sightseeing, a battered car driven by their father's young, rebellious estate manager Ashok (Ravichandran) bumps into their car. The sisters quarrel with Ashok and are annoyed by his <b>insolence.</b> At their home, they force Viswanathan to dismiss Ashok. Infuriated, Ashok pitches a tent overlooking their bungalow and begins a strike to get his job back. Nirmala accidentally drops a bucket of water on Ashok's head, hurting him. Feeling guilty, she visits Ashok's tent to apologise and they fall in love.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by {{the actions}} of the Temeraires crew, Campbell met with Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell the {{following}} day and informed him of the mutineers' demands. Mitchell reported the news to the Admiralty while Campbell returned to Temeraire and summoned the crew on deck once more. He urged them to return to duty, and then dismissed them. Meanwhile, discipline had begun to break down among the mutineers. Several of the crew became drunk, and some of the officers were struck by rowdy seamen. When one of the marines who supported the mutiny was placed in irons for drunken behaviour and <b>insolence,</b> a crowd formed on deck and tried to free him. The officers resisted these attempts and as sailors began to push and threaten them, Campbell gave the order for the marines to arrest those he identified as the ringleaders. The marines hesitated, but then obeyed the order, driving the unruly seamen back and arresting a number of them, who were immediately placed in irons. Campbell ordered the remaining crew to abandon any mutinous actions, and deprived of its leaders, the mutiny collapsed, though the officers were on their guard for several days afterwards and the marines were ordered to carry out continuous patrols.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} said by {{commentators}} that from the publication of this manifesto, [...] "modern French Canada began", while CBC calls it [...] "one {{of the most important}} and controversial artistic and social documents in modern Quebec society". Along with the publication of Les <b>insolences</b> du Frère Untel (the <b>Insolences</b> of Brother So-and-so), the Asbestos miners' strike of 1949, and the Maurice Richard Riot of 1955, Le Refus Global is widely seen to {{have been one of the}} precursors to the Quiet Revolution.|$|R

5|$|Ancient lore {{states that}} Vana'diel was {{created as a}} {{playground}} for the Gods and their children, who themselves were spawned from an enormous and sentient Crystal. Eventually wishing to be one with the Gods, the children constructed a pathway to paradise. They were smote down for their <b>insolence,</b> however, and their cities cast {{to the bottom of}} the sea. After seeing the destruction of her children and filled with sadness, the Goddess Altana wept five tears that gave life to the five Enlightened Races of Vana'diel. The God of Twilight, Promathia, condemned her weakness, however, and the life that arose from it. Promathia cursed the five races with eternal conflict amongst themselves by bringing forth their darkest attributes: the apathy of the Humes, the arrogance of the Elvaan, the rage of the Galka, the cowardice of the Tarutaru, and the envy of the Mithra. He created the Beastmen, commanding them to forever fight the people of Vana'diel and occupy their minds, so these children would never have time to group together and construct a pathway like the ones before them. The creation lore's sentient Crystal, Gods, Children, and the truths behind them feature as major plot points in several Final Fantasy XI expansion packs, while the Beastmen are some of the game's main antagonists.|$|E

25|$|Aristides Damalas (Greek: Aριστεíδης Δαμαλάς, {{alternative}} spellings Aristidis or Aristide), {{known in}} France by the stage name Jacques Damala, (15 January 1855 – 18 August 1889), was a Greek military officer-turned-actor, who is mostly remembered as being husband to Sarah Bernhardt {{for a number}} of years. Damala's characterization by modern researchers is far from positive. His handsomeness was as notable as his <b>insolence</b> and Don Juan quality. Writer Fredy Germanos describes him as an opportunistic and hedonistic person, whose marriage to the great diva would inevitably intensify and maximize his vices, namely, his vanity and obsession with women, alcohol, and drugs.|$|E
5000|$|The poet Mesomedes wrote a hymn to Nemesis in {{the early}} second century AD, where he {{addressed}} her:"Nemesis, winged balancer of life, dark-faced goddess, daughter of Justice, and mentioned her [...] "adamantine bridles" [...] that restrain [...] "the frivolous <b>insolences</b> of mortals".In early times the representations of Nemesis resembled Aphrodite, who sometimes bears the epithet Nemesis.|$|R
50|$|Les <b>insolences</b> du Frère Untel {{is a book}} first {{published}} in Montreal by Les Éditions de l'Homme in 1960. In {{a very short time}} it sold more than 100,000 copies, in a society where a book with a 10,000 copy print run was considered a best seller. The anonymous author was Jean-Paul Desbiens, a Marist Brother, who attacked the church-controlled education system in Quebec.|$|R
60|$|As the {{buildings}} which showed her utmost skill were chiefly exposed to lightning, she is invoked in defence from it; and our petition in the Litany, against sudden death, was written originally to her. The blasphemous corruptions of {{her into a}} patroness of cannon and gunpowder, {{are among the most}} ludicrous, (because precisely contrary to the original tradition,) as well as the most deadly, <b>insolences</b> and stupidities of Renaissance Art.|$|R
25|$|It {{was also}} a place of pilgrimage for Queen Catherine of Aragon who was a regular pilgrim. Likewise, Anne Boleyn also {{publicly}} announced an intention of making a pilgrimage but it never occurred. Its wealth and prestige did not, however, prevent its being a disorderly house. The visitation of Bishop Nicke in 1514 revealed that the prior was leading a scandalous life and that, among many other things, he treated the canons with <b>insolence</b> and brutality; the canons themselves frequented taverns and were quarrelsome. The prior, William Lowth, was removed and by 1526 some decent order had been restored.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, Mr. Funk, {{a friend}} of her late husband, appears at her door and pressures Hilde to join the Retiree's Union. She joins because Anton {{had been a member}} of the Austrian Socialist Party and he would have approved of her socializing with other members. Hilde assures Mr. Funk that she will attend the next evening social. Mr. Funk's visit forces another memory to resurface. She remembers her daughter asking what party Anton had belonged to during the period of National Socialism; Hilde recalled him being part of the Hitler Youth. The reader also discovers that Hilde's brother, Hannes, was killed by the Nazi Party. Erika's <b>insolence</b> upsets Hilde greatly.|$|E
25|$|Cabell {{conducted}} an investigation {{in which he}} and his associates interviewed a range of civilians (including US Consul Lawton) and military personnel {{in an attempt to}} determine what caused the border violence that 27 August. After completing his investigation, Gen. Cabell informed his commanding officer that an unnamed US customs inspector had been found guilty of “improper conduct” and removed from duty because of his harsh treatment of Mexicans. Cabell's report expressed dismay at the “frequent cases of <b>insolence</b> and overbearing conduct” among US customs inspectors. The investigation laid the blame, albeit begrudgingly, for the outbreak of violence in Ambos Nogales on resentment among nogalenses over the routine mistreatment of Mexican border crossers.|$|E

60|$|Oh, and {{sometimes}} {{she felt as if}} she would go mad. What did it matter, what did it matter if their books were dirty and they did not obey? She would rather, in reality, that they disobeyed the whole rules of the school, than that they should be beaten, broken, reduced to this crying, hopeless state. She would rather bear all their insults and <b>insolences</b> a thousand times than reduce herself and them to this. Bitterly she repented having got beside herself, and having tackled the boy she had beaten.|$|R
25|$|The two soon met. Even though Bernhardt {{was appalled}} by Damala's <b>insolence</b> towards her, she was {{nevertheless}} strongly {{attracted to him}} and soon fell {{madly in love with}} the Greek. During that period, Bernhardt was about to begin her world tour; knowing that Damala was transferred in Saint Petersburg and interested in meeting him again, she decided to arrange a six-month stay in Russia, despite the fact she had previously – repeatedly – rejected offers of making appearances there. Indeed, she resided in Saint Petersburg for a few months, as an official guest of Emperor Alexander III of Russia, during which her romance with Damala flourished. The openness of their affair scandalized the social circles of the city and proved a common topic of discussion.|$|E
25|$|Monogamy was the rule, and a childless wife {{might give}} her husband a maid to bear him children, who were then {{reckoned}} hers. She remained mistress of her maid, and might degrade her to slavery again for <b>insolence,</b> {{but could not}} sell her if she had borne her husband children. If the wife did this, the Code did not allow the husband to take a concubine; but if she did not, he could do so. The concubine was a co-wife, though not of the same rank; the first wife had no power over her. A concubine was a free woman, often dowered for marriage, and her children were legitimate and lawful heirs. She could only be divorced on the same conditions as a wife.|$|E
25|$|When the Turks in Samarra {{realized}} that al-Musta'in had {{departed from the}} city, they cut off traffic to Baghdad. A delegation of Turks then {{went to see the}} caliph; when they arrived, they asked for forgiveness for their actions and for the caliph to return with them to Samarra. Al-Musta'in, while promising the Turks that they would continue to be paid, refused to leave Baghdad, and he and Muhammad b. 'Abdallah mocked them for their perceived <b>insolence.</b> The humiliated Turks angrily returned to Samarra and told their compatriots what had happened; they then decided to depose al-Musta'in. The soldiers released al-Mu'tazz from his prison and acknowledged him as their caliph. Al-Mu'tazz agreed to the proposal and an oath of allegiance was drawn up; many of the officials in Samarra then swore allegiance to him.|$|E
5000|$|Following World War II, {{while most}} of the United States and Canada was enjoying a long period of {{prosperity}} and modernization, economic growth was slower in Quebec. The level of formal schooling among French Canadians was quite low: only 13% finished grade 11, as opposed to 36% of English Canadians. One of the most scathing attacks on the educational system was levelled by Brother Jean-Paul Desbiens, writing under the pseudonym of Frère [...] The publication of his book Les <b>insolences</b> du Frère Untel (1960) quickly sold over 100,000 copies and has come to be recognized as having important impact on the beginning of the Quiet Revolution.|$|R
5000|$|Stories about Henry's {{supposedly}} riotous {{early life}} emerge {{after his death}} in chronicles commissioned by his brother Humphrey of Lancaster, Duke of Gloucester, who wished to emphasise how pious and ascetic his brother had become during his reign. According to pseudo-Elmham [...] "He fervently followed the service of Venus as well as of Mars, as a young man might he burned with her torches, and other <b>insolences</b> accompanied the years of his untamed youth." [...] Tito Livio Frulovisi in Vita Henrici Quinti also says, [...] "he exercised meanly the feats of Venus and Mars and other pastimes of youth for so long as the king his father lived." ...|$|R
6000|$|Poor George, {{careless}} {{of these}} ulterior issues, has always trouble {{enough with the}} mere daily details, Parliamentary <b>insolences,</b> Jacobite plottings, South-Sea Bubbles; and wishes to hunt, when he gets over to Hanover, rather than to make Marriage-Treaties. Besides, as Wilhelmina tells us, they have filled him with lies, these Hanover Women and their emissaries: [...] "Your Princess Wilhelmina is a monster of ill-temper, crooked {{in the back and}} what not," [...] say they. If there is to be a Marriage, double or single, these Improper Females must first be persuaded to consent. [Memoires de Bareith.] Difficulties enough.
