5|$|Flight 007 {{has been}} the subject of ongoing {{controversy}} and has spawned a number of conspiracy theories. Many of these are based on the suppression of evidence such as the <b>flight</b> <b>data</b> recorders, unexplained details such as the role of a USAF RC-135 surveillance aircraft, the untimely destruction of the U.S. Air Force's King Salmon radar data, or merely Cold War disinformation and propaganda.|$|E

40|$|Lift {{and drag}} <b>flight</b> test <b>data</b> is {{presented}} from the National Flying Laboratory Centre, Jetstream 31 aircraft. The aircraft has been modified as a flying classroom for completing flight test training courses, for engineering degree accreditation. The straight and level <b>flight</b> test <b>data</b> {{is compared to}} data from 10 % and 17 % scale wind tunnel models, a Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes steady-state computational fluid dynamics model and an empirical model. Estimated standard errors in the <b>flight</b> test <b>data</b> are ± 2. 4 %± 2. 4 % in lift coefficient, ± 2. 7 %± 2. 7 % in drag coefficient. The <b>flight</b> test <b>data</b> also shows the aircraft to have a maximum lift to drag ratio of 10. 5 at Mach 0. 32, a zero lift drag coefficient of 0. 0376 and an induced drag correction factor of 0. 0607. When comparing the characteristics from the other models, the best overall comparison with the <b>flight</b> test <b>data,</b> in terms of lift coefficient, was with the empirical model. For the drag comparisons, all the models under predicted levels of drag by up to 43 % {{when compared to the}} <b>flight</b> test <b>data,</b> with the best overall match between the <b>flight</b> test <b>data</b> and the 10 % scale wind tunnel model. These discrepancies were attributed to various factors including zero lift drag Reynolds number effects, omission of a propeller system and surface excrescences on the models, as well as surface finish differences...|$|R

5|$|The TSB made nine {{recommendations}} {{relating to}} changes in aircraft materials (testing, certification, inspection, and maintenance), electrical systems, and <b>flight</b> <b>data</b> capture, as both flight recorders had stopped when they lost power six minutes before impact. General recommendations were also made regarding improvements in checklists and in fire-detection and fire-fighting equipment and training. These recommendations have led to widespread changes in FAA standards, principally impacting wiring and fire hardening.|$|E

Mulder, Joanne, Fletcher and Scully arrive at a bar in Rachel, Nevada, where Mulder's informant is revealed to be General Wegman. Wegman admits that he sabotaged the UFO, but maintains that he only tried to merely disable the stealth module so that Mulder could see it. Wegman gives Fletcher, who he thinks is Mulder, the proof of the encounter, a <b>flight</b> <b>data</b> recorder in a paper bag. Meanwhile, Mulder leaves and talks to Scully in the car. Later, Mulder and Fletcher meet in the bar's bathroom and argue about the <b>flight</b> <b>data</b> recorder. As they argue, General Wegman enters the bathroom and discovers the two. Mulder meets with General Wegman to discuss the UFO. Wegman believes that now that Fletcher knows Wegman's identity, when restored to his own body, Fletcher will turn him in. Wegman explains that he hoped that Mulder could explain whether aliens actually exist; apparently the craft are simply given to the military without knowing where they are from or how they work.|$|E
5|$|Glasnost {{reforms in}} the same year brought about a {{relaxation}} of press censorship; consequently reports started to appear in the Soviet press suggesting that the Soviet military knew the location of the wreckage and had possession of the <b>flight</b> <b>data</b> recorders.

5|$|The DC-9 {{carried a}} {{primitive}} <b>flight</b> <b>data</b> recorder that recorded basic {{information about the}} aircraft's air speed, acceleration, heading, and altitude on metal foil tapes. Additionally, the aircraft was equipped with a simple cockpit voice recorder that recorded all conversations {{that took place in}} the cockpit of the aircraft. The flight recorder was recovered by investigators on Thursday, June 10, 1971, and sent to Washington D.C. for analysis. Though the voice recorder was also recovered, the thermal protective measures had failed and the recording tapes were destroyed by fire.|$|E
5|$|The ICAO investigation, led by Caj Frostell, did {{not have}} the {{authority}} to compel the states involved to hand over evidence, instead having to rely on what they voluntarily submitted. Consequently, the investigation {{did not have}} access to sensitive evidence such as radar data, intercepts, ATC tapes, or the <b>Flight</b> <b>Data</b> Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) (whose discovery the U.S.S.R. had kept secret). A number of simulations were conducted with the assistance of Boeing and Litton (the manufacturer of the navigation system).|$|E
5|$|The <b>flight</b> <b>data</b> {{recorder}} stopped recording at 22:25:40 AT (01:25:40 UTC), followed {{one second}} {{later by the}} cockpit voice recorder. The aircraft briefly appeared again on radar screens from 22:25:50 AT (01:25:50 UTC) to 22:26:04 AT (01:26:04 UTC). The last altitude recorded was 9,700 feet. According to the cockpit voice recorder, shortly after the first emergency declaration, the captain left his seat to fight the fire that was spreading {{to the rear of}} the cockpit; the Swissair volume of checklists was later found fused together in the wreckage, indicating that the captain may have attempted to use them to fan back the flames. The captain did not return to his seat; whether he was killed by the fire, asphyxiated by the smoke, or killed in the crash is not known. <b>Flight</b> <b>data</b> recording shows that engine two was shut down due to an engine fire approximately one minute before impact, implying that the first officer was still alive and continued trying to fly the aircraft until the final moments of the flight. At 22:31:18 AT (01:31:18 UTC), the aircraft struck the ocean at an estimated speed of 345mph (555km/h, 154m/s, or 299 knots) and with a force of the order of 350g, causing the aircraft to disintegrate instantly.

The <b>flight</b> <b>data</b> recorders were the key pieces of evidence sought by both governments, with the United States insisting that an independent observer from the ICAO be present on one of its search vessels in the event that they were found.

5|$|On November 18, 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in a {{goodwill}} {{gesture to}} South Korea {{during a visit}} to Seoul to ratify a new treaty, released both the <b>flight</b> <b>data</b> recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of KAL007. Initial South Korean research showed the FDR to be empty and the CVR to have an unintelligible copy. The Russians then released the recordings to the ICAO Secretary General. The ICAO report continued to support the initial assertion that KAL007 accidentally flew in Soviet airspace, after listening to the flight crew's conversations recorded by the CVR, and confirming that either the aircraft had flown on a constant magnetic heading instead of activating the INS and following its assigned waypoints, or, if it had activated the INS, it had been activated when the aircraft had already deviated beyond the 7½-nautical mile Desired Track Envelope within which the waypoints would have been captured.|$|E

The cockpit voice recorder, which was damaged but still usable, was recovered by rescue workers and was examined by the investigation team.
