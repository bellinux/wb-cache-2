A tumor can expand {{the size of the}} liver several times and consequent stretching of its capsule can cause aching pain in the right <b>hypochondrium.</b> Other causes of pain in enlarged liver are traction of the supporting ligaments when standing or walking, the liver pressing against the rib cage or pinching the wall of the abdomen, and straining the lumbar spine. In some postures the liver may pinch the parietal peritoneum against the lower rib cage, producing sharp, transitory pain, relieved by changing position. The tumor may also infiltrate the liver's capsule, causing dull, and sometimes stabbing pain.|$|E

5000|$|In anatomy, the {{division}} of the abdomen into regions can employ a nine-region scheme, in which the <b>hypochondrium</b> is {{the upper part of the}} abdomen on either side, inferior to (below) the thorax, in the area of the lower ribs.|$|E
50|$|The Stamm {{gastrostomy}} {{is an open}} technique, requiring {{an upper}} midline laparotomy and gastrotomy, with the catheter brought out in the left <b>hypochondrium.</b> It was first devised in 1894 by the American Gastric Surgeon, Martin Stamm (1847 - 1918), who was educated greatly in surgery when he visited Germany.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the regions}} of the abdomen, the <b>hypochondrium</b> is the {{uppermost}} part. The word derives from the Greek term ὑποχόνδριος hypokhondrios, meaning [...] "of the soft parts between the ribs and navel" [...] from ὑπό hypo ("under") and χόνδρος khondros, or cartilage (of the sternum). Hypochondria in Late Latin meant [...] "the abdomen".|$|E
50|$|Renal colic {{typically}} {{begins in}} the flank and often radiates to the <b>hypochondrium</b> (the part of the anterior abdominal wall below the costal margins) or the groin. It is typically colicky (comes in waves) due to ureteric peristalsis, but may be constant. It {{is often described as}} one of the strongest pain sensations known.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{sources have}} disputed {{usage of the}} term for {{the parts of the}} {{anterior}} abdominal wall below the costal margins. The region named the right <b>hypochondrium</b> exists anatomically, but is almost totally under the chest wall. In clinical situations, the parts of the abdominal wall just below the right and left costal margins are referred to as the right and left hypochondriac regions respectively.|$|E
50|$|The {{descending}} colon {{begins at the}} splenic flexure at the upper left part of the abdomen. It passes downward through the left <b>hypochondrium</b> and lumbar regions, along the outer border of the left kidney and ends at the lower left part of the abdomen where it continues as the sigmoid colon. It is retroperitoneal in two-thirds of humans. In the other third, it has a (usually short) mesentery. The arterial supply comes via the left colic artery.|$|E
50|$|The main symptom is vomiting, which {{typically}} occurs after meals of undigested food, {{devoid of any}} bile. A history of previous peptic ulcers and loss of weight is not uncommon. In advanced cases, signs to look for on physical examination are wasting and dehydration. Visible Peristalsis {{from left to right}} may be present. Succussion splash is a splash-like sound heard over the stomach in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen on shaking the patient, with or without the stethoscope. Bowel sound may be increased due to excessive peristaltic action of stomach. Fullness in left <b>hypochondrium</b> may also be present.|$|E

30|$|This was a {{prospective}} observational study. Four senior and two junior physicians were shown, in an unpaired randomized order, abdominal US videos from 11 patients with and 11 patients without pneumoperitoneum. Abdominal US videos {{were obtained from}} consecutive patients presenting to ED complaining abdominal pain with the diagnosis of pneumoperitoneum established by CT. Abdominal US was performed according to a standardized protocol that included the following scans: epigastrium, right and left <b>hypochondrium,</b> umbilical area and right <b>hypochondrium</b> with the patient lying on the left flank. We evaluated accuracy, intra- and inter-observer agreement of abdominal US when reviewed by senior physicians. Furthermore, we compared the accuracy of a “ 2 scan-fast exam” (epigastrium and right <b>hypochondrium)</b> vs the full US examination and the accuracy of physicians expert in US vs nonexpert ones. Finally, accuracy of US was compared with abdominal radiography in patients with available images.|$|E
30|$|Abdominal US was {{performed}} after CT {{by one of}} two emergency physicians sonographers with 2  years of experience in abdominal US. The following machines equipped with a 3.5 – 5  MHz convex and 4 – 8  MHz linear probe were used: MyLab 30 Gold, MyLab Alpha (Esaote, Genova, Italy) and HD 7 (Philips, Amsterdam, Holland). All patients underwent a standardized US protocol that included the following scans: epigastrium, right <b>hypochondrium,</b> left <b>hypochondrium,</b> umbilical area and right <b>hypochondrium</b> with the patient lying for at least 2  min on the left flank. The scans were performed both with linear and convex probes starting randomly {{with one of the}} two probes; the probe was gently held on patients’ skin without pressing with the aim of avoiding the compression of intraperitoneal air and the depth was adjusted to have the peritoneum line in the half upper part of the screen. All scans were recorded in a video of 5  s each.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{test the}} {{efficacy}} of the puncture in the left <b>hypochondrium</b> as an alternative method. METHODS: Sixty-two patients randomly distributed into two groups were studied: Group LH, puncture in the left <b>hypochondrium</b> (n= 30), and Group ML, puncture in the abdominal midline (n= 32). The following were assessed: needle positioning tests, number of failed attempts at needle insertion, and time needed for creation of pneumoperitoneum. Gas flow, volume and intraperitoneal pressure were recorded at every 20 seconds, until a 12 mmHg pressure was reached inside the peritoneal cavity. RESULTS: A similar number of positive results for the needle positioning tests were observed in both groups. Two failed attempts to reach the peritoneal cavity were observed in Group ML and one in Group LH. The time necessary for the creation of pneumoperitoneum was on average 3 minutes and 46 seconds for Group LH, and 4 minutes and 2 seconds for Group ML. Average gas flow, volume and pressure were equivalent for both groups. CONCLUSION: Puncture in the left <b>hypochondrium</b> was as effective as puncture in the abdominal midline for the creation of pneumoperitoneum...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: This is {{a report}} of a rare case of an old woman with a large round mass in the right <b>hypochondrium</b> that was proven to be an abscess. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 82 -year old woman with a firm round mass in the right <b>hypochondrium</b> was {{admitted}} for evaluation. The abdominal CT showed an abscess produced by a gallbladder perforation, and a gallstone impacted at the Hartmann's pouch. DISCUSSION: The abscess was treated with a transcutaneous paracentesis, while the stone passed to the gastrointestinal tract through a cholecystoenteric fistula, without causing any further problems. CONCLUSION: Gallbaldder perforation can rarely create a subcutaneous abscess especially in thin, elder subjects. Abscess drainage is {{the first line of}} treatment...|$|E

40|$|Based on the EEG-observation {{of falling}} asleep when {{patients}} are under peloid therapy applied {{on the right}} <b>hypochondrium,</b> following assumption is made to clarify the mechanism of inducing sleep. While patients are under the peloid therapy, some chemical substance will be produced in circulating blood; L-tryptophan, an essential amino acid and a precursor of serotonin, gets over a blood-brain barrier easily to induce sleep. Six healthy volunteers, each sex by threes, were selected to apply peloid pack on the right <b>hypochondrium</b> for 30 minutes following 12 -hour fasting. Significant increase in plasma L-tryptophan level was obtained in the clinical experiment. It is speculated from the preliminary data that L-tryptophan increased by the peloid therapy may possibly act as a specific physiological hypnotics...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this}} {{communication}} was to report clinical disorders and biological abnormalities in patients followed over a 3 - to 18 -year period after the last date of fasciolosis treatment. These observations were noted in 87 individuals (out of 711) during a 30 -year epidemiological survey. RESULTS: We noted diffuse pain in the right <b>hypochondrium,</b> persisting 2 to 6 years after treatment (3. 7 % of persons), and weight loss appearing during treatment and persisting afterwards (2. 1 %). CONCLUSIONS: Our current state of knowledge leads us to asking whether pain in the right <b>hypochondrium</b> and weight loss would not {{be due to the}} presence of persistent hepatic lesions following fasciolosis treatment. Other investigations in patients after treated fasciolosis are necessary to confirm these abnormalities and determine their frequency...|$|E
