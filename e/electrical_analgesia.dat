40|$|The {{results of}} an open study on drug {{acceptability}} are presented using the anti-inflammatory compound fenoprofen calcium (Fepron; Fenopron). The work {{was carried out by}} 80 General Practitioners each reporting on 10 patients, following a protocol that was both easy to comply with and limited in its objective. Analysis of the data suggests that results obtained may be of interest to clinicians, epidemiologists and industrialists. It is further suggested that similar studies should be conducted with drugs already familiar to both practitioners and patients and eventually with other therapeutic procedures such as acupuncture or <b>electrical</b> <b>analgesia.</b> Â© 1981.
