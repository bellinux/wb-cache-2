These messaging types are called Type A EDIFACT format for real time interactive communication and Type B TTY for informational and booking type of messages. Message construction standards set by IATA and ICAO, are global, and apply to more than air transportation. Since airline reservation systems are business critical applications, and they are functionally quite complex, the operation of an in-house airline reservation system is relatively expensive.|$|E

The first algorithm {{based on the}} previous resistivity reconstruction and the second one based on the usage of the inverse measured voltages. Efficiency of the presented algorithms is compared with {{the efficiency of the}} direct conductivity distribution reconstruction algorithm. Modeling results shows that due to better linearity the both indirect algorithms always provides better convergence of the iterative reconstruction process than direct algorithm. In indirect algorithms do not need to know exactly the level of initial approach of the conductivity distribution, because this level almost never affects the iterative process and initial approaching of the conductivity can always be uniform distribution of size 1 S·m. Therefore (at least in the first iterations) it is advisable to use indirect algorithms. Copyright © 2013 IFSA...|$|R

40|$|Decomposable {{mathematical}} programming problems sometimes admit {{a certain degree}} of decentralization in the decision process. By an informative interplay between a central authority and a number of subdivisions one hopes to establish the overall best solution. This interplay can be organized in either of two ways: direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>distribution.</b> However, an absolute prerequisite for such procedures to be successful is the availability of an optimality criterion to the centre so as to know when to stop the iterative process. It is well known that for either of two cases the optimality conditions as derived from the Kuhn-Tucker conditions for the overall problem are not satisfactory. The present paper makes a comparison between the shortcomings of the two kinds of conditions. In the case of direct distribution this condition turns out to be necessary but unfortunately not sufficient and for <b>indirect</b> <b>distribution</b> the condition is sufficient but not necessary. The insufficiency in the direct and the absence of necessity in the indirect case, which are caused by eventual nonconvexities of the problem, are explored a bit further.

40|$|This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} the structure of distribution channels for community-based tourism (CBT) in Banteay Chhmar commune. It explores the factors influencing the distribution channel structure and then examines and discusses {{the implications of these}} factors as a means to help improve CBT sales. This study takes both the demand and supply side perspectives into account {{in order to understand the}} issues being investigated more comprehensively. Taking a case study approach, this study is based on in-depth interviews with the community and other relevant key channel members, and a survey is employed to collect information from visitors to the community. The examination of the distribution channel structure for CBT reveals considerable channel diversity. The Banteay Chhmar community is found to utilize a distribution mix which includes a wide range of both direct and indirect channels to enable them to reach broader markets. The findings suggest that the CBT direct distribution channel is relatively short and straightforward while the <b>indirect</b> <b>distribution</b> channels are rather diverse and lengthy. Given the diversity of intermediaries involved, <b>indirect</b> <b>distribution</b> channels for the CBT are complex and often multi-levelled. The majority of visitors who travel to the community purchase their packages through ground travel operators making <b>indirect</b> <b>distribution</b> more prevalent in the CBT distribution structure. The study also reveals that there is very limited connection among local channel members, such as, accommodation providers, transportation service providers and souvenir shops. This limitation inhibits CBT product sales. Regarding the domestic market, (mainly school groups), the findings show that the direct channel is more prevalent. There are a number of factors that influence the structure of the distribution channels for CBT. These include commissionable products, product characteristics and market access, information communication and technology, partnership issues and the nature of the operators, capacity issues, and lastly, but most importantly market trends. This study identifies several implications for the Banteay Chhmar community. However, growth (increased sales volume), looks promising if the community develop sound distribution strategies and implement them accordingly; essentially bringing the community and the market together. In addition, the strategies could also help the community to have more control over the development process and opportunity to minimize adverse impacts...|$|E
