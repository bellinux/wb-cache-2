40|$|This {{research}} work was performed under the service {{contract for the}} further development and application of the TREMOVE transport model. TREMOVE 2 is a transport and emissions simulation model developed for the European Commission. It is designed to {{study the effects of}} different transport and environment policies on the emissions of the transport sector. The model estimates transport demand, modal split, vehicle fleets, emissions of air pollutants and welfare level under different policy scenarios. All relevant transport modes are modelled. The TREMOVE 2 version used for the presented simulation covers the 1995 - 2020 period for 21 countries. The model is described in detail by Proost, S., De Ceuster, G., Van Herbruggen, B., Logghe, S., Ivanova, O., Carlier, K. (2006 / 1). As explained in the Communication “Community strategy to reduce CO 2 emissions from passenger cars and to improve fuel economy ” (COM(95) 689 final) the European Community aims at reducing CO 2 emission from passenger cars. The European Council and the European Parliament specified that the objective of the strategy should be to achieve an average test-cycle CO 2 emission figure for new passenger cars of 120 <b>gram</b> CO 2 <b>per</b> <b>kilometre.</b> The Community strategy was based on three pillars: a) agreements with the car industry on fuel economy improvements; b) fuel-economy labelling of cars; c) fiscal measures.

40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} investigates if the stringent 2020 and 2050 overarching CO 2 mitigation objectives set {{out by the}} European Union dominate its 2010 to 2020 targets {{specific to}} the transportation arena, specifically its biofuel penetration objectives and <b>gram</b> CO 2 <b>per</b> <b>kilometre</b> emission caps. Using a dynamic recursive general equilibrium model, IMACLIM-R, we demonstrate that these overarching targets do not dominate the interim transportation targets when the carbon policy triggering compliance with the mitigation objectives boils down to the theoretical least-cost option of uniform carbon pricing. Ground transportation is confirmed as quite insensitive to high carbon prices, even when such prices are applied over a long term. It is tempting to conclude that pursuing the mitigation objectives specific to transportation will impose unnecessary costs. However, because of the second best conditions prevailing in actual economies, and {{of the risk of}} lock-in in carbon intensive trajectories, we conclude with the urgent need for some ambitious transport-specific policy design research agenda...|$|R
40|$|The seed {{moisture}} level marking {{the onset of}} imbibitional injury (breakpoint) was determined for two cultivars of Phaseolus vulgaris L. cvs `Tendercrop' (TC) and `Kinghorn Wax' (KW). At 20 °C the breakpoints were 0. 15 gram H 2 O/gram dry weight (<b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram)</b> for TC and 0. 11 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> for KW. When seeds were imbibed at 5 °C, the breakpoints were 0. 19 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> (TC) and 0. 16 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> (KW). Below the breakpoint germination changed 4. 6 %/ 0. 01 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> for all treatments. Imbibition rates were maximal at 0. 07 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> and 0. 33 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> after 20 minutes imbibition. Rates of electrolyte leakage were correlated with the imbibition rate maximum at 0. 07 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> but were unaffected by the maximum at 0. 33 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram.</b> The transition from tightly bound to semibound water occurred at 0. 09 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> and 0. 11 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> for KW and TC, respectively. T 1 values increased exponentially as seed moisture decreased from 0. 47 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> to 0. 05 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram.</b> 13 C-NMR sugar signals increased at {{moisture level}}s above 0. 14 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> and plateaued at approximately 0. 33 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> seed moisture.

Imbibition and leakage rate maxima reflect transitions in the states of seed water. NMR data support the application of the Water Replacement Hypothesis to seeds. Thus, imbibitional injury may be related to specific, temperature dependent moisture levels that are determined by water binding characteristics in the seed tissue...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a spatial {{comparison of the}} carbon dioxide (mean grams of CO 2 <b>per</b> <b>kilometre)</b> and the nitrogen oxide (mean <b>grams</b> of NOx <b>per</b> <b>kilometre)</b> emissions factors of the car fleets registered across the local authorities of the United Kingdom as of 2014. These metrics are derived from the New European Driving Cycle test procedure and provide {{an indication of the}} global and local pollution profiles of the local car stock. Exploratory spatial analysis indicates that these emission factors exhibit a substantial geographical variation across the local authorities, suggesting that some local car fleets are dirtier or cleaner than others. Spatial autocorrelation analysis indicates that a significant degree of spatial organisation in these emission factors is present, with a number of hot-spots and cold-spots identified. Interestingly, these emission factors are uncorrelated with one another, suggesting that they represent separate perspectives on the environmental sustainability of the local car fleet. A series of ordinary least squares and spatial regression models are specified which partially explain the variation in both the emission factors. These models utilise ancillary attributes of the car fleet, the socioeconomic characteristics of the population and the features of the application environments as explanatory variables to determine how local contexts condition these metrics. The results of the models identify a complex set of associations between these different variable categories, with certain variables both promoting and hindering improvements in the car emission factors. These results might prove of use in the formation of policy initiatives to mitigate emissions of these compounds from car use, illustrating that the pursuit of these two objectives may require alternative strategies in terms of car fleet management...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} the exhaust gas of cars {{equipped}} with different engine types, i. e. cars with diesel engines, cars with petrol engines and three-way-catalysts, and cars with petrol engines without catalysts was analysed. Five cars of each engine type were {{measured on a}} chassis dynamometer under conditions of the US- 75 test procedure and the 'Autobahn' test. The emission factors of CO, NO_x, total HC, particles and CO_ 2 were determined. In addition, measurements of 45 different hydrocarbons, 9 different carbonyles, phenole and {{the sum of the}} cresoles were performed. The influence of the cold start phase and the mean velocity on the composition of the car exhaust was analysed with special emphasis on the individual VOC's (VOC-split). For this purpose, the different phases of the test cycles were regarded separately. The cars equipped with a three-way-catalyst showed the largest span of the emission factors in <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilometre</b> over the different test phases. The highest emissions of hydrocarbons and carbonyles were observed during the cold start (first phase of the US- 75 test) when the catalyst is not or not fully active. Compared to the cold start the emissions are reduced by a factor of 10 to 20 in the other phases of the US- 75 test. On the other hand with higher mean velocities as driven in the 'Autobahn' test an increase of the emissions nearly up {{to the level of the}} cold start emissions was observed. This effect is due to the change of the air-fuel-ratio. When high loads are needed, more fuel is added and therefore the conversion efficiency of the catalyst is decreasing. The VOC split was analysed by grouping the individual VOC into five different substance classes: alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, carbonyles and phenoles. For cars with three-way-catalysts large changes in the VOC split were observed for the different test phases. In the cold-start phase the contribution of aromatic compounds was largest, followed by alkenes and alkanes. In the warm phases of the US- 75 alkanes are the most prominent substance class. In the Autobahn test the contribution of the aromatics increases with increasing mean velocity. (orig.)
