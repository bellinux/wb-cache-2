5|$|West Avenal {{departed}} Norfolk on {{a voyage}} to Leith, Scotland on 9 April 1919, but {{was forced to}} return to port after suffering an <b>engine</b> <b>breakdown.</b> Following repairs, she made several voyages between the East Coast of the United States and various destinations in South America, Spain, France and England. A few mentions of the ship crop up in contemporary news accounts. In August 1919, for example, The New York Times shows West Avenal slated for departure to Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 12 August. The following January, the newspaper reported that West Avenal was rammed by the British Leyland Line cargo ship Lacastrian. Departing New York in a dense fog {{on the morning of}} 9 January 1920 for Antwerp, Lacastrian rammed into the port side of West Avenal, which was inbound with a load of onions from Valencia, Spain. The damage was severe enough that West Avenals captain ordered her grounded to avoid sinking in New York Harbor. More than two weeks later, The Washington Post printed a photograph of West Avenal, still grounded off the Red Hook flats. Another report in the Times a year later showed her arrival in Saint-Nazaire, France, on 13 August 1920.|$|E

500|$|West Bridge {{was one of}} the West ships, {{a series}} of steel-hulled cargo ships built for the [...] on the West Coast of the United States. The ship was {{launched}} in April 1918 and delivered to the U.S. Navy upon completion in May. After commissioning, USS West Bridge sailed from the Pacific Northwest to the East Coast of the United States and joined a convoy of cargo ships headed to France in August. After West Bridge suffered an <b>engine</b> <b>breakdown</b> at sea, the convoy was attacked by two German submarines and West Bridge was torpedoed and abandoned. A salvage crew from American destroyer [...] boarded the ship the following day, and, working with four tugs dispatched from France, successfully brought the ship into port. Four men received the Navy Cross for their efforts in saving West Bridge.|$|E

They were considered easy to fly and popular among the crews. Quite common were <b>engine</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> mostly due to the low engine position when on the ground, which demanded clean airfields, but thanks to twin-engine arrangement, few such failures were fatal.|$|R

2500|$|In 1946, Empire Emerald {{was sold}} to Lobitos Oilfields Ltd and renamed El Gallo. She {{remained}} under the management of Bowring's. On 20 April 1947, El Gallo suffered an <b>engine</b> <b>breakdown</b> {{off the coast of}} Co. Wicklow, Ireland. Two tugs were sent from Dublin to prevent her running aground on the Codling Bank. She was carrying [...] of kerosene from Curaçao, Netherlands Antilles to Dublin. In 1949, she made a voyage to Panama City, Panama and Santiago, Chile. In 1954, El Gallo underwent a survey, which resulted in repairs costing £85,000 being carried out as a result of metal fatigue being discovered in some structural areas of the ship. In 1958, Lobitos Oilfields Ltd reported that they intended to sell El Gallo. She arrived at Briton Ferry, Glamorgan on 5 February 1959 for scrapping.|$|E

On 10 September 1962, she participated in Exercise Tucker Box 2 in the Coral Sea and in November she was at Perth, Western Australia where the Commonwealth Games were taking place. On 21 November, a mayday was received from the Scripps research vessel , which was off St Paul Island and had a crewmember who was critically ill. Wave Ruler responded and gave assistance. In July 1963, Wave Ruler was one of four RFA ships that escorted [...] from the United Kingdom to the Far East. In February 1965, Wave Ruler suffered a major <b>engine</b> <b>breakdown</b> off Port Said, Egypt. She slowly sailed to Malta for repairs, arriving on 10 February.

2500|$|The ferry service {{gained a}} new lease of life, however, {{with the growth of}} motor traffic, and a service was re-opened in 1926. [...] Between 1931 and 1966, a ferry service was {{operated}} by Enoch Williams of the Old Passage Severn Ferry Company Ltd. Initially, this was only able to transport passengers with bicycles and motorbikes, but, by 1934, the Severn Queen was launched as a car ferry. It was able to carry just 17 cars. Each car had to turn sharply off the ramp onto the ferry, then be turned on a manually operated turntable before being parked. The process was reversed for unloading. [...] The ferry timetable was notoriously affected by the huge tidal range on the Severn. [...] It was unable to operate at low tide or at very high tides. There was also a reported <b>engine</b> <b>breakdown</b> where the ferry took 2 hours to repair whilst drifting all the time down the Bristol Channel with the outward tide and after the engine was repaired it took hours to return to Aust. An all day crossing. The last ferry crossing occurred on 8 September 1966, the day before the first Severn Bridge opened.|$|E

On 27 November, she straggled behind the convoy due to an <b>engine</b> <b>breakdown.</b> She detached from the convoy and arrived at Stornoway, Outer Hebrides on 1 December, departing the next day to join Convoy WN 47, which had {{departed from}} the Clyde on 30 November and arrived at Methil, Fife on 4 December. She departed two days later as a member of Convoy FS 354, which arrived at Southend, Essex on 8 December.|$|E
50|$|All five PZL.26s {{took part}} in the Challenge from August 28 to September 16, 1934. A 9538 km long rally over Europe {{appeared}} too difficult for engines, and three aircraft failed to finish the rally due to <b>engine</b> <b>breakdowns</b> (pilots: Szczepan Grzeszczyk, Andrzej Włodarkiewicz and Jan Balcer). Piotr Dudziński (SP-PZL) took the 11th place and Ignacy Giedgowd (SP-PZM) the 17th place (by coincidence, these results were similar to those of PZL.19s, two years earlier). Giedgowd's engine failed during a maximum speed trial, though. It is noteworthy, that they had the 2nd and 4th results of average speed in the rally - 211 and 213 km/h.|$|R

The convoy stopped at Magdalena Bay and Acapulco in Mexico and at Corinto, Nicaragua, before mooring at Coco Solo in the Canal Zone on 28 August.

5|$|However, {{problems}} with the combat system, excessive noise, and <b>engine</b> <b>breakdowns</b> were recurring and appeared across the entire class. These and other shortcomings were often made harder to solve by disagreements between Kockums, ASC, Rockwell, the RAN, and the Australian Government over the nature of problems, their causes, and {{who was responsible for}} solving them. Media reporting of the problems during the mid-1990s was often negative and exaggerated, creating poor public perception. This was aided by politicians, who used the shortcomings to politically attack the Labor Party and Kim Beazley, particularly after Labor was defeated by the Liberal-National Coalition in the 1996 federal election, and Beazley became Leader of the Opposition. During the mid-1990s, it was recommended on several occasions that the submarine project be abandoned, and the completed submarines and incomplete hulls be broken up for scrap.|$|R
40|$|The main {{gas path}} components, namely {{compressor}} and turbine, are inherently reliable but {{the operation of}} the aero engines under hostile environments, results into <b>engine</b> <b>breakdowns</b> and performance deterioration. Performance deterioration increases the operating cost, due to the reduction in thrust output and higher fuel consumption, and also increases the engine maintenance cost. In times when economic considerations dominate airline operators’ strategies, carrying out unnecessary rectification, can be very costly and time consuming. In an attempt to minimize such unexpected circumstances, having detailed knowledge prior to any inspection will allow the gas turbine user {{to take some of the}} maintenance action when it is necessary. Advanced engine-fault diagnostics tools offer the possibility of identifying degradation at the module level, determining the trends of these degradations during the usage of the engine, and planning the maintenance action ahead...|$|R
