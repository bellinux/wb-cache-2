25|$|Worf avoided Ezri at first, {{confused}} about what to <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> new situation. Her quick posting to DS9 led {{to a number of}} awkward moments between her and Worf, since the new host carried all the memories of their former hosts but had its own distinct personality, despite their shared past. Also, it was considered taboo on Trill for new hosts to fraternize with former lovers. After a brief rekindling of their feelings for one another, they decided that things were just too different and, eventually, the two settled into a comfortable friendship, with Ezri eventually becoming romantically involved with Julian Bashir (who previously had feelings for Jadzia). This allowed Worf to accept 'his' Jadzia to have her place into Sto-Vo-Kor.|$|E
25|$|The play dramatises {{events in}} More's life, and {{it deals with}} issues of {{obedience}} to the crown and rule of law, particularly when a populace has become stirred up in an anti-alien fervor. It consists of 17 scenes, four of them cancelled. It begins with the Ill May Day events of 1517: Foreign nationals, who have immigrated to England from Lombardy, which is the northern region {{of what is now}} known as Italy, are misbehaving in a variety of ways, and are treating the citizens of London with abuse and disrespect. This is outraging the workers of London, who decide to join together on Mayday and seek revenge on the newcomers. London noblemen are having difficulty deciding what to <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> when rioting breaks out all across London, and even the Mayor of London is endangered. The noblemen decide to engage Sheriff Thomas More, who is popular and respected by the people, to try and calm the civil unrest.|$|E
500|$|The play's premiere {{and initial}} run were mostly {{critically}} acclaimed. The religious community's {{reviews of the}} initial run were also positive. After the first performances in 2011, Louis Hobson of the Calgary Sun said the character of Marta was an unrealistic caricature and didn't [...] "ring true" [...] because of how she was written. The character underwent a series of rewrites to make her more well-rounded and kind before the 2012 cross-Canada tour. In the 2012 tour, the play was performed in several fringe theatre festivals, at which critics representing the Montreal Gazette, the Winnipeg Free Press, and CFEQ-FM said it stood out for its quality and moral content. The writing was praised by one critic from the Victoria News, who wrote that the play demonstrates that Kooman has a [...] "gift for creating powerful, believable dialogue that can draw an audience in", but criticised by Chamberlain of the Times Colonist, who attested to [...] "melodramatic—and just plain bad—cop-show dialogue". Liz Nicholls of the Edmonton Journal called the performances compelling. Karen Nelson, also of the Edmonton Journal, called the play [...] "sobering" [...] {{in such a way}} that she was caused [...] "to wonder what [...] could <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> global epidemic of abuse of children, women and the disenfranchised." ...|$|E
