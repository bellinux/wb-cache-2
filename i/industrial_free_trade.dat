40|$|Master in International Economics and European StudiesMadeira, {{which is}} an Autonomous Region of Portugal and an Outermost Region of the EU, is {{currently}} facing problems regarding the sustainability of the Regional Government’s finances. The Government of the Republic was asked to provide assistance {{in exchange for the}} implementation of an austerity plan. Madeira’s International Business Center, encompassed by the International Business Center and the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Zone created in the 80 s, is considered by the Regional Government as a powerful mechanism to increase economic growth, attract FDI and generate fiscal revenue in a period where the “contraction of the [Portuguese] economic activity is unprecedented”. As the power of regional authorities are limited by para-constitutional law, full fiscal autonomy from the mainland is non-existent, therefore cannot be used as a jurisdictional tool to promote development. What is its impact on the RAM’s budget, as the fiscal regime can be improved to decrease budget dependence from the Portuguese central government while maintaining the current supply of public goods and services by the Regional Government? Being an explanatory and argumentative thesis, it aims {{to come up with a}} policy proposal regarding what can be done to improve the archipelago’s economy through the Center; methodologically consisting of literature review, economic data and reports produced by regional, national and European authorities along with interviews to those directly involved with the Center...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the history of {{industrial}} development strategies with respect to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The history of economic development in Penang provides a backdrop for subsequent development. In Penang, the structural transformation of the state was enabled by the leadership of four State Chief Ministers. Firstly, under the leadership of Wong Pow Nee, we saw the establishment of Mak Mandin and the Perai Industrial area. Secondly, under Lim Chong Eu there was the transformation of Penang into an industrialized entity. The rapid economic transformation during this period using the Penang Development Corporation as a facilitating mechanism made a big impact on the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Zone, especially in terms of utilizing the industrial policy to improve employment opportunities. Thirdly, efforts were made by Koh Tsu Koon, the third State Chief Minister who took initiative to uplift SMEs in the 1990 s through global supplier programs in PDC. Koh Ksu Koon improved the framework that was inherited from Lim Chong Eu. Finally, from 2008 onwards, under the leadership of Lim Guan Eng, the secretary-general of DAP, the national opposition party that is currently ruling the state of Penang, the state has changed its direction of development whereby besides concentrating on the electronic sector, it has also promoted Penang as a centre for medical tourism industry. This shift in development and sectoral paradigm is due to the challenges faced b...|$|E

50|$|Many {{countries}} have introduced scores of new reforms and procedures—such as {{the release of}} business directories, franchising, lease purchase,service, credit rating, collection agencies, <b>industrial</b> estates, <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> zones, and credit cards. Additionally, a diverse range of Internet services have formed. Each new facility improves effective use of available social energies for productive purposes. The importance of these facilities for speeding development is apparent when they are absent. When Eastern European countries wanted to transition to market-type economies, they were seriously hampered in their efforts due {{to the absence of}} supportive systems and facilities.|$|R

40|$|This paper furnishes robust {{evidence}} that the GATT/WTO has had a powerful and positive impact on trade. The impact has, however, been uneven. GATT/WTO membership for industrial countries {{has been associated with}} a large increase in imports estimated at about 40 percent of world trade. The same has not been true for developing country members, although those that joined after the Uruguay Round have benefited from increased imports. Similarly, there have been asymmetric effects among sectors, with WTO membership associated with substantially greater imports in sectors where barriers are low. These results are consistent with the history and design of the institution, which presided over significant trade liberalization by the industrial countries except in sectors such as food and clothing; largely exempted developing countries from the obligations to liberalize under the principle of special and differential treatment; but attempted to redress the latter by imposing greater obligations on developing country members that joined after the Uruguay Round.

40|$|In 1991 the European Union (EU) and a {{group of}} states {{belonging}} to the European <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> Area (Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Iceland) signed European Economic agreement covering the single market four freedoms, mainly affecting industrial goods. Within this zone all tariffs, non-tariff barriers and contingent protection were abolished and competition rules regulated trade as within the EU. Many have seen this as a model for relations between the EU and the Countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEECs), but as well shall show this is an inappropriate analogy. Adoption of common competition rules was only a minor element {{in the creation of a}} system of wholly <b>free</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>trade</b> between the EU and the other countries of the EEA. We argue that while the EEA was a useful response to the situation it addressed, it cannot be extrapolated to the case of the CEECs for a number of reasons. The core of the argument is the argument that an agreement by partner countries to adopt EU-style internal competition laws cannot be used as a vehicle to circumvent pressure for contingent protection emanating within the EU...|$|R
40|$|Adopting {{the basic}} Ricardian static trade model, Two-country (Home and Foreign), Two-goods (Agricultural and Industrial) and One-factor (labour) model with {{environmental}} resource, we extended Copland and Taylor (1999) in three points. Firstly, we assumed pollution should be trans-boundary. Secondly, we considered the technical difference between two countries. Thirdly, we introduced international migration. We {{assumed that the}} only difference between two countries is the pollution protecting technology caused by industrial production. There will occur three different situations depending on the strength of demand on industrial good. Firstly, if industrial good is strongly preferred, the country with low technology (country L) will specialize in production of industrial good and another country (country H) will produce both goods. In this case, if trade is permitted, country L will gain while whether country H will gain or not is ambiguous. Moreover, after <b>free</b> <b>trade,</b> there occurs no international migration. Secondary, if both goods are preferred almost equally, then country H (L) will specialize agricultural (<b>industrial)</b> good. Whether <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> is beneficial or not for each country depends on parameters. After trade, there remains wage gap between two countries and therefore international migration from L to H will occur. Thirdly, if industrial good is weakly preferred, then country L produces both goods while country H produces agricultural good only. In this case <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> will reduce the economic welfare of country L while the effects on country H is ambiguous. After <b>free</b> <b>trade,</b> workers will migrate from L to H if permitted. In the second and third cases, migration expands the production of agricultural good but reduces that of industrial good and it will continue until comparative advantage of each country diminishes. If we consider that one of the two goods is non-tradable, there is no possibility of international trade but if international migration is permitted, workers in country L will migrate to country H, which will not end before all of inhabitants in country L quit their home country. ...|$|R
