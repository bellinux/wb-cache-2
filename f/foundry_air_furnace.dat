40|$|AbstractSpraying heat {{exchanger}} and tubular radiation recuperator are common equipment of the drying hot <b>air</b> <b>furnace.</b> To study {{the way of}} reducing the investment cost for the {{heat exchanger}} of high-temperature and high-capacity hot <b>air</b> <b>furnace,</b> the heat exchange area of the two heat exchangers was calculated by LMTD method when air temperature rose from 0 °C, 100 °Cand 200 °C to different temperature points, and {{the figure of the}} relationship between the temperature difference and average heat exchange area was given. According to the analysis, the economical temperature range of the heat exchangers is narrower as the inlet air temperature rises. When the air temperature difference keeps constant, the average heat exchange area increases as the inlet air temperature rises. When the inlet air temperature keeps constant, the average heat exchange area increases gradually as the air temperature difference rises. Then the average heat exchange area exceeds the economical temperature range and approaches infinity quickly. The analytical method of economic performance can be applied to the design and model selection of two-stage heat exchanger of high-temperature and high-capacity hot <b>air</b> <b>furnace...</b>|$|R
50|$|By 1786, {{when the}} {{operators}} were Baille, Pocock and Co., the site had two blast furnaces, which could each produce 40 tons of iron a week, <b>air</b> <b>furnaces,</b> two bar iron forges and three steam engines. The site manufactured cannon.|$|R
50|$|The company's main {{business}} was producing cast-iron goods. Molten iron for this foundry work {{was not only}} produced from the blast furnaces, but also by remelting pig iron in <b>air</b> <b>furnaces,</b> {{a variant of the}} reverberatory furnace. The Company also became early suppliers of steam engine cylinders in this period.|$|R

50|$|Functioning in {{a similar}} manner as a {{conventional}} forced <b>air</b> <b>furnace,</b> systems provide heat by recirculating conditioned building air through solar collectors. Through the use of an energy collecting surface to absorb the sun’s thermal energy, and ducting air to come in contact with it, a simple and effective collector can be made for a variety of air conditioning and process applications.|$|R
50|$|William Strutt {{designed}} a new mill building in Derby {{with a central}} hot <b>air</b> <b>furnace</b> in 1793, although the idea had been already proposed by John Evelyn almost a hundred years earlier. Strutt's design consisted of a large stove that heated air brought from the outside by a large underground passage. The air was ventilated through the building by large central ducts.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment is to evaluate the oxidation performance and heat resistance of the Ultra-high Temperature Ceramics (UHTCs) ZrB 2 and HfB 2 under high temperature, high heat flux, ablative, and oxidative environments. The investigation of UHTCs such as ZrB 2 and HfB 2 could potentially lead to new, easily reusable thermal protection systems (TPS) for space craft. The UHTC samples will be oxidized using an oxy-acetylene torch and a high temperature <b>air</b> <b>furnace.</b> The torch will expose the samples to rapid heating, high velocity combustion gasses, and sample temperatures in excess of 3000 °C. The furnace will expose the samples to temperatures up to 1600 °C in static air. Once tested, the samples will be analyzed to determine weight change, ablation rate, oxide layer thickness, and oxidation reaction products. It is expected that the torch test will produce a more aggressive environment than the <b>air</b> <b>furnace</b> resulting in greater oxidation of the UHTC specimens...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of rapid}} heat {{transfer}} using a fluidized bed on the heat-treating response of Al-Si-Mg alloys (both unmodified and Sr modified) were investigated. The heating {{rate in the}} fluidized bed is greater than in conventional <b>air</b> convective <b>furnaces.</b> Particle size analyses of eutectic Si showed that the high heating rate during fluidized bed solution heat treatment causes faster fragmentation and spherodization of Si particles compared to conventional <b>air</b> convective <b>furnaces.</b> The mechanism of Si fragmentation through fluidized bed processing is through both brittle fracture and neck formation and its propagation. In contrast to this, the mechanism of Si fragmentation using a conventional <b>air</b> convective <b>furnace</b> is through neck formation and propagation. The Sr-modified D 357 alloy showed a faster spherodizing rate than the unmodified alloy. Thermal analyses showed an exothermic reaction during solution heat treatment using a fluidized bed due to recrystallization, and coarsening of eutectic Al grains. Whereas the alloy solutionized using a conventional <b>air</b> convective <b>furnace</b> showed two exothermic reactions, one due to annihilation of point defects and the other due to recrystallization, and coarsening of the eutectic grains in the aluminum matrix. The recrystallization temperature of the alloy solutionized in the fluidized bed is lower {{than those in the}} conventional <b>air</b> convective <b>furnace.</b> Both tensile strength and elongation of fluidized bed solutionized alloys are greater than those solutionized using the <b>air</b> convective <b>furnace.</b> The optimum heat-treatment time for T 4 temper using a fluidized bed for unmodified and Sr-modified alloy was reduced to 60 and 30 minutes, respectively...|$|R
50|$|In the 1690s, they (or associates) {{applied the}} reverberatory furnace (in this case {{known as an}} <b>air</b> <b>furnace)</b> to melting pig iron for foundry purposes. This was used at Coalbrookdale and various other places, but became {{obsolete}} {{at the end of}} the 18th century with the introduction of the foundry cupola, which was a kind of small blast furnace, and a quite different species from the reverberatory furnace.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second step}} in the {{quenching}} process is soaking. Workpieces can be soaked in <b>air</b> (<b>air</b> <b>furnace),</b> a liquid bath, or a vacuum. The recommended time allocation in salt or lead baths is up to 6 minutes. Soaking times can range a little higher within a vacuum. As in the heating step, {{it is important that}} the temperature throughout the sample remains as uniform as possible during soaking.|$|R
50|$|Edward E. Freeman {{invented a}} system to control a hot <b>air</b> <b>furnace</b> that uses three {{thermostatic}} switches for its operation. A room thermostat starts the stoker. Another thermostat (or limit switch) opens the stoker circuit when the <b>air</b> in the <b>furnace</b> reaches a predetermined temperature, irrespective {{of the fact that}} the room thermostat may still call for heat. This second thermostat operates to prevent unsafe conditions due to overheating. The third thermostat is also in the furnace. It controls a fan which forces hot <b>air</b> from the <b>furnace</b> to the rooms. It does not permit the fan to start until the <b>air</b> in the <b>furnace</b> reaches a specified degree of heat. But, at that point, it starts the fan, which continues to run, even though the limit switch has stopped the stoker, so long as the furnace is hot and the room thermostat calls for heat. The patent was on the combination patent of three thermostatic switches, not on any of the switches alone and not on the combination of the fan switch and the limit switch.|$|R

50|$|Liquid-to-air {{heat pumps}} (also called water-to-air) output forced air, and are most {{commonly}} used to replace legacy forced <b>air</b> <b>furnaces</b> and central <b>air</b> conditioning systems. There are variations that allow for split systems, high-velocity systems, and ductless systems.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of the biogas power plants {{byproduct}} (digestate) as biofuel in an ordinary domestic <b>air</b> <b>furnace.</b> The digestate, disposed by a 1 MW biogas plant located in Italy, was dried out and pelletized in order to be used as fuel in a wood pellet furnace with 29 kW(th) of nominal power, commonly installed in industrial HVAC systems. The first test was carried out starting from a heavily dried pellet called "digestate 0 " characterized chemically and physically in order to obtain its composition, while its ashes were tested using an optical thermal dilatometer for the softening point evaluation. This first test outlined that the "digestate 0 " pellets were not suitable for combustion applications even when mixed with an equal part of pure wood pellets. The research then focused on the raw digestate drying process through a set of physical and chemical tests. It was found that a temperature of 150 degrees C maximizes the higher heating value of the new "digestate 1 " at 16. 6 MJ/kg. However, to further avoid the ash sintering, "ultimate digestate" pellets were prepared mixing 50 % of "digestate 1 " and 50 % of wood. The digestate obtained in such a way was experimentally tested through several runs of the <b>air</b> <b>furnace.</b> In these tests, the overall efficiency as well as the furnace emissions was measured...|$|R
