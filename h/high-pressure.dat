5|$|Breathing {{air supply}} can come {{directly}} from a <b>high-pressure</b> breathing air compressor, from a <b>high-pressure</b> storage system, or from a combined storage system with compressor. Direct charging is energy intensive, and the charge rate will be limited by the available power source and capacity of the compressor. A large-volume bank of <b>high-pressure</b> storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical <b>high-pressure</b> air by recharging the storage banks from a low-power compressor, or using lower cost off-peak electrical power.|$|E
5|$|The <b>high-pressure</b> {{turbine stages}} in the CFM56 are {{internally}} cooled by air from the <b>high-pressure</b> compressor. The air passes through internal channels in each blade and ejects at the leading and trailing edges.|$|E
5|$|City streetlights are <b>high-pressure</b> sodium vapor lamps.|$|E
5|$|The {{low-pressure}} oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP) is an {{axial-flow pump}} which operates at approximately 5,150 rpm {{driven by a}} six-stage turbine powered by <b>high-pressure</b> liquid oxygen from the <b>high-pressure</b> oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP). It boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from , with the flow from the LPOTP then being supplied to the HPOTP. During engine operation, the pressure boost permits the <b>high-pressure</b> oxidizer turbine to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPOTP, which measures approximately , {{is connected to the}} vehicle propellant ducting and supported in a fixed position by being mounted on the launch vehicle's structure.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} form as {{a result}} of significant convective activity, and are warm core. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. Cyclolysis is the opposite of cyclogenesis, and is the <b>high-pressure</b> system equivalent, which deals with the formation of <b>high-pressure</b> areas—Anticyclogenesis.|$|E
5|$|A <b>high-pressure</b> area, high or {{anticyclone}} is {{a region}} where the atmospheric pressure at {{the surface of the}} planet is greater than its surrounding environment.|$|E
5|$|At high {{pressures}} (more {{than about}} 20atm or twoMPa), {{a mixture of}} helium and oxygen (heliox) can lead to <b>high-pressure</b> nervous syndrome, a sort of reverse-anesthetic effect; adding {{a small amount of}} nitrogen to the mixture can alleviate the problem.|$|E
5|$|Cascade filling may be {{used for}} {{efficiency}} when multiple storage cylinders are available. <b>High-pressure</b> storage is commonly used when blending nitrox, heliox and trimix diving gases, and for oxygen for rebreathers and decompression gas.|$|E
5|$|Cylinders {{may also}} be filled {{directly}} from <b>high-pressure</b> storage systems by decanting, with or without pressure boosting to reach the desired charging pressure.|$|E
5|$|DCS {{is caused}} by a {{reduction}} in ambient pressure that results in the formation of bubbles of inert gases within tissues of the body. It may happen when leaving a <b>high-pressure</b> environment, ascending from depth, or ascending to altitude.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{had first}} begun to {{consider}} the potential applications of steam power for transportation while still an apprentice in the 1780s, and had developed rudimentary designs for 'steam carriages' in the 1790s. In 1801, Evans definitively began work on making his long-held dream of a steam carriage into reality. Early steam engineers, most notably Watt contemporary William Murdoch, had developed plans for a steam-propelled carriage incorporating a heavy flywheel, in which pressure was converted directly to rotary power, however it became apparent in experimentation that a low-pressure, rotary steam engine would never be powerful enough to propel a carriage of any weight forward. Evans's attention thus turned to a reciprocating engine, not only for his steam carriage ideas, but also for industrial application. Importantly, Evans became an early proponent of 'strong steam' or <b>high-pressure</b> engines, an idea long resisted by Watt and earlier steam pioneers because the necessary iron making and metal working technology was lacking. Evans recognized that a <b>high-pressure</b> steam engine would be essential {{to the development of}} a steam carriage because they could be built far smaller while providing similar or greater power outputs to low-pressure equivalents. Some experiments with <b>high-pressure</b> steam engines had been made in Europe, most notably an unsuccessful steam tractor developed by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot. However the prevailing fear of early steam engineering was that no boiler could safely contain <b>high-pressure</b> steam. Evans ignored potential drawbacks, and developed radically different designs which called for engines operating at <b>high-pressure</b> and the elimination of the condenser—a central component of conventional designs. His designs also incorporated a grasshopper beam, a double-acting cylinder, and four steam valves. Each valve was independently operated by one of four cams. The resulting design was a <b>high-pressure</b> steam engine that had a higher power-to-weight ratio that prevailing designs, making locomotives and steamboats practical. It was also mechanically simpler than condensing engines, making it less costly to build and maintain, and did not require large volumes of condensing water. These features would make it similarly suited for a variety of industrial applications.|$|E
5|$|Evans' {{contributions}} to steam {{were not as}} ground-breaking as his earlier work in milling but he {{played a critical role}} by inventing and propagating the <b>high-pressure</b> steam engine in the United States. Evans' engines, particularly the Columbian, were highly influential in early steam-power applications in United States (particularly in the evolution of steamboats and steam-powered industrial processes). Yet once more Evans was ahead of the curve with many of his ideas, and his death during steam's infancy in the United States meant that it would be some time before many of his ideas would come to fruition. For example, although a leading advocate for <b>high-pressure</b> engines, it would not be until the 1830s that such engines definitively replaced low-pressure designs. And Evans' dream of a steam wagon, notwithstanding the brave attempt of the Oruktor Amphibolos, would not see widespread adoption until even later. And unlike his earlier contributions, Evans was just one of many brilliant minds in steam technology. It would be another inventor, Richard Trevithick, working totally independently of Evans who would develop the <b>high-pressure</b> engine that would make that dream possible.|$|E
5|$|Helium is commercially {{available}} in either liquid or gaseous form. As a liquid, {{it can be}} supplied in small insulated containers called dewars which hold as much as 1,000 liters of helium, or in large ISO containers which have nominal capacities as large as 42m3 (around 11,000 U.S. gallons). In gaseous form, small quantities of helium are supplied in <b>high-pressure</b> cylinders holding as much as 8m3 (approx. 282 standard cubic feet), while large quantities of <b>high-pressure</b> gas are supplied in tube trailers which have capacities {{of as much as}} 4,860m3 (approx. 172,000 standard cubic feet).|$|E
5|$|On most crude-oil tankers, {{a special}} crude oil washing (COW) system {{is part of}} the {{cleaning}} process. The COW system circulates part of the cargo through the fixed tank-cleaning system to remove wax and asphaltic deposits. Tanks that carry less viscous cargoes are washed with water. Fixed and portable automated tank cleaning machines, which clean tanks with <b>high-pressure</b> water jets, are widely used. Some systems use rotating <b>high-pressure</b> water jets to spray hot water on all the internal surfaces of the tank. As the spraying takes place, the liquid is pumped out of the tank.|$|E
5|$|Somewhat weaker {{but more}} common are <b>high-pressure</b> areas caused by {{atmospheric}} subsidence, that is, areas where large masses of cooler drier air descend from {{an elevation of}} 8 to 15km after the lower temperatures have precipitated out the water vapor.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 is a {{high-bypass}} {{turbofan engine}} (most {{of the air}} accelerated by the fan bypasses {{the core of the}} engine and is exhausted out of the fan case) with several variants having bypass ratios ranging from 5:1 to 6:1, generating 18,500 to 34,000lbf (80kN to 150kN) of thrust. The variants share a common design, but the details differ. The CFM56 is a two-shaft (or two-spool) engine, meaning that there are two rotating shafts, one <b>high-pressure</b> and one low-pressure. Each is powered by its own turbine section (the <b>high-pressure</b> and low-pressure turbines, respectively). The fan and booster (low-pressure compressor) evolved over the different iterations of the engine, as did the compressor, combustor and turbine sections.|$|E
5|$|The polar easterlies, {{also known}} as Polar Hadley cells, are dry, cold {{prevailing}} winds that blow from the <b>high-pressure</b> areas of the polar highs at {{the north and south}} poles towards the low-pressure areas within the Westerlies at high latitudes. Unlike the Westerlies, these prevailing winds blow from the east to the west, and are often weak and irregular. Because of the low sun angle, cold air builds up and subsides at the pole creating surface <b>high-pressure</b> areas, forcing an equatorward outflow of air; that outflow is deflected westward by the Coriolis effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{product of}} a quadruple VAM (vacuum arc melting) process, {{combined}} with hot extruding and different rolling applications is cured using <b>high-pressure,</b> high-temperature gas autoclaving. This produces reactor-grade zirconium that is about 10 times {{more expensive than the}} hafnium-contaminated commercial grade.|$|E
5|$|The work {{split between}} the two {{companies}} gave GE responsibility for the <b>high-pressure</b> compressor (HPC), the combustor, and the <b>high-pressure</b> turbine (HPT); SNECMA {{was responsible for the}} fan, the low-pressure compressor (LPC), and the low-pressure turbine (LPT). SNECMA was also responsible for the initial airframe integration engineering, mostly involving the nacelle design, and was initially responsible for the gearbox, but shifted that work to GE when it became apparent that it would be more efficient for GE to assemble that component along with their other parts.|$|E
5|$|Used in {{so-called}} diamond anvil experiments to create <b>high-pressure</b> environments, diamonds {{are able to}} withstand crushing pressures in excess of 600 gigapascals (6 million atmospheres).|$|E
5|$|An {{earthquake}} at 8:32:17a.m. PDT (UTC−7) on Sunday, May 18, 1980, {{caused the}} entire weakened north face to slide away, creating the largest landslide ever recorded. This allowed the partly molten, <b>high-pressure</b> gas- and steam-rich {{rock in the}} volcano to suddenly explode northwards toward Spirit Lake in a hot mix of lava and pulverized older rock, overtaking the avalanching face.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{automated}} mill, Evans's ideas were harshly criticized by other engineers—most notably {{some of the}} Philadelphia engineering community including the influential Benjamin Latrobe. As it happened, Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick had simultaneously developed similar ideas in favor of <b>high-pressure</b> engines and begun to experiment with them in developing the first locomotives, but neither knew of the other's work.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{significance}} for planetary cores, the physical properties of iron at high pressures and temperatures {{have also been}} studied extensively. The form of iron that is stable under standard conditions can be subjected to pressures up to ca. 15GPa before transforming into a <b>high-pressure</b> form, {{as described in the}} next section.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{dissolving}} in the water, {{oxygen and}} other gases {{are trapped in}} a type of structure called a clathrate. In clathrate structures, gases are enclosed in an icy cage and look like packed snow. These structures form at the <b>high-pressure</b> depths of Lake Vostok and would become unstable if brought to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Blackcherry is {{a limited}} edition trim, {{available}} in the UK since November 2010 {{and based on the}} VTR+. It was sold with the 1.6-litre <b>High-pressure</b> Direct Injection (HDi) diesel engine. It was discontinued and replaced with the Code Red and Code White in January 2012, which have the same engine.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{had long}} been an {{acquaintance}} of John Fitch, the first to build a steamboat in the United States, and the two had worked together on steam projects. The Oruktor Amphibolos was Evans's lone attempt at building his own steamboat powered by a <b>high-pressure</b> engine and Evans himself was often vague in appraising its capabilities. Yet Robert Fulton had found success with the North River Steamboat on the Hudson River in 1807, and thereafter steamboats became a reality. Although he used low-pressure engines, Fulton had in 1812 contacted Evans {{about the possibility of}} using Evans's engines, though that correspondence did not lead to the implementation of any of Evans's designs for Fulton's steamships. The Mississippi and tributaries experienced far stronger currents than eastern counterparts, and low-pressure steamboats lacked the power to counteract these. The Enterprise was the first viable steamboat to run on these rivers, and its designer Daniel French employed an adapted Evans' engine for the purpose. <b>High-pressure</b> engines became the standard on the Mississippi, though relatively few of those were actually built by the Pittsburgh works as Evans' patent on <b>high-pressure</b> engines was not widely enforced, and many other engine shops opened on the Mississippi that freely adapted Evans' designs for their own purposes.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{are due to}} its 61-inch {{titanium}} wide chord fan, 3D aerodynamics designed new {{core and}} low-pressure turbine with single crystal <b>high-pressure</b> turbine and Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). Fan blades are reduced from 38 to 24 and it incorporates features from the CFM56-5 series such as a double-annular combustor as an option.|$|E
5|$|In {{synthetic}} diamond {{grown by}} the <b>high-pressure</b> high-temperature synthesis or chemical vapor deposition, defects with symmetry lower than tetrahedral align to {{the direction of}} the growth. Such alignment has been also been observed in gallium arsenide and thus is not unique to diamond.|$|E
5|$|Isobaric {{analysis}} is performed on these maps, which involves {{the construction of}} lines of equal mean sea level pressure. The innermost closed lines indicate the positions of relative maxima and minima in the pressure field. The minima are called low-pressure areas while the maxima are called <b>high-pressure</b> areas. Highs are often shown as H's whereas lows are shown as L's. Elongated areas of low pressure, or troughs, are sometimes plotted as thick, brown dashed lines down the trough axis. Isobars are commonly used to place surface boundaries from the horse latitudes poleward, while streamline analyses {{are used in the}} tropics. A streamline {{analysis is}} a series of arrows oriented parallel to wind, showing wind motion within a certain geographic area. C's depict cyclonic flow or likely areas of low pressure, while A's depict anticyclonic flow or likely positions of <b>high-pressure</b> areas. An area of confluent streamlines shows the location of shearlines within the tropics and subtropics.|$|E
5|$|September 1, 2006- The {{combined}} {{effects of}} Tropical Storm Ernesto {{and a large}} <b>high-pressure</b> system leave about 151,000 without power and several trees damaged from strong winds. The system also drops moderate rainfall peaking at 5.15inches (129mm) in Jones Crossing; one person requires assistance to be rescued from a flooded roadway.|$|E
5|$|Specialized {{applications}} include use in laboratories as containment for <b>high-pressure</b> experiments (see diamond anvil cell), high-performance bearings, {{and limited}} use in specialized windows. With the continuing advances {{being made in}} the production of synthetic diamonds, future applications are becoming feasible. The high thermal conductivity of diamond makes it suitable as a heat sink for integrated circuits in electronics.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56-5A {{series is}} the initial CFM56-5 series, {{designed}} {{to power the}} short-to-medium range Airbus A320 family. Derived from the CFM56-2 and CFM56-3 families, the -5A series produces thrusts between 22,000 and 26,500lbf (98kN and 118kN). Aerodynamic improvements such as an updated fan, low-pressure compressor, <b>high-pressure</b> compressor and combustor make this variant 10–11% more fuel efficient than its predecessors.|$|E
5|$|The aircraft's number 2 port engine No.5097, {{constructed}} in 1961, had run for 14,917 hours from new, {{and had been}} overhauled in spring 1965 because of vibration caused by metal fatigue that had led {{to the failure of}} a stage 8 <b>high-pressure</b> compressor blade. In 1967 the engine had been removed from service because of flame tube deterioration, and as part of the repairs, the low-pressure compressor, of which the number 5 wheel was an original component, was overhauled, but the wheel itself was not tested for fatigue. On 22 November 1967 the engine was bench tested and rejected because of excessive vibration of the <b>high-pressure</b> compressor, but was later released as serviceable following further analysis. After 1,415 hours service on another 707 and modification to the turbine seals, on 5 April 1968 No.5097 became number 2 engine of the port wing of the aircraft, scheduled to fly long-haul to Sydney, Australia, three days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of commercially available synthetic diamonds are yellow and {{are produced by}} so-called <b>high-pressure</b> high-temperature (HPHT) processes. The yellow color is caused by nitrogen impurities. Other colors may also be reproduced such as blue, green or pink, which {{are a result of}} the addition of boron or from irradiation after synthesis.|$|E
5|$|The stages {{were built}} by the Belgian company Stageco along with the U.S.-based company Enerpac. Each stage {{deployed}} <b>high-pressure,</b> state-of-the-art hydraulic systems. These {{were used for the}} first time ever to assemble and dismantle the high tonnage structure. Stageco designed a unique system, based on Enerpac's Synchronous Lift System, to raise the modular construction to a height of 30 metres in an efficient and effective manner.|$|E
5|$|The strongest <b>high-pressure</b> {{areas are}} {{associated}} with cold air masses which push away out of polar regions during the winter when there is less sun to warm neighboring regions. These Highs change character and weaken once they move further over relatively warmer water bodies.|$|E
