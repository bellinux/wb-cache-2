50|$|One of the hotel’s unusual {{features}} was {{the availability}} of radio broadcasts in each guest room. An October 1926 article in the Los Angeles Times described the “outstanding” <b>in-room</b> <b>entertainment</b> feature as follows:Each room in the new hostelry has four radio jets, each connecting with the radio-receiving room in the tower. By plugging in {{on any of these}} four jets, programs from broadcasting stations are heard … If there is a particular program on the air which a guest particularly desires to hear, it is only necessary to phone the receiving room and the operator will tune it in.|$|E
50|$|The former {{director}} of Norway's National Museum, Swedish curator Sune Nordgren has hand picked paintings, prints, sculptures and installations for the rooms and public areas, while interior designer Anemone Wille Våge decorated the rooms and Scandinavian designer Maggie Wonka designed the bathrobes. The international music collective Apparatjik has hand picked music on vinyl as part of <b>in-room</b> <b>entertainment.</b> The group has also created the music used for the hotel's wake-up call and the turndown service. In the Apparatjik suite guests can project {{the members of the}} group onto their bed creating an illusion of being in bed with the band.|$|E
50|$|By {{the last}} half of the 1970s, more than a million Magic Fingers units had been {{installed}} in American and European hotels and houses. The devices started to seem out of date and somewhat sleazy, because of the bed's association with seedy motels, and their popularity declined starting in the 1980s as other <b>in-room</b> <b>entertainment</b> options became available and theft of money from the coin boxes started to become more common. Houghtaling sold the rights to the Magic Fingers name after he retired in the 1980s, with the new owner manufacturing units for home use at the time of his death in 2009. Though the devices are rarely seen in the 21st century, they were still available in motels in the Western United States at the time of his death.|$|E
40|$|An {{assessment}} of how hotel guests view in-room entertainment-technology amenities was conducted to compare {{the importance of these}} technologies to how they performed. <b>In-room</b> <b>entertainment</b> technology continues to evolve in the hotel industry. However, given the multitude of entertainment products available in the marketplace today, hoteliers have little understanding of guests’ expectations and of which in-room entertainment-technology amenities will drive guest satisfaction and increase loyalty to the hotel brand. Given that technology is integral to a hotel stay, this study seeks to evaluate the importance and performance of in-room entertainment-technology amenities. Findings indicate that free-to-guest television (FTG TV) and high-speed Internet access were the two most important inroom entertainment-technology amenities {{when it comes to the}} selection of a hotel for both leisure and business travelers. The Importance/Satisfaction Matrix presented in the current study showed that many of the in-room entertainment-technology amenities are currently a low priority for guests.

40|$|In {{the modern}} economy {{organizations}} {{are trying to}} find every means possible to increase productivity and reduce costs. As such many organizations have turned to technology to aid in this. Due to this in recent years there has been a transition from traditional consumer self-service environments to technology assisted self-service environments. Through the use of technology customers are able to create products and services for purchase by with little to no help from the organization providing the products and services. The hotel industry has also seen a rise in the use of technology applications to guests in performing services once only conducted by employees. A specialized form of this type of usage of self-service technology in the hotel industry is known as Guest Empowerment Technology (GET). Specifically, Guest Empowerment Technologies are electronic systems that allow hotel guests to have more personal control over their stay in a hotel as well as systems that provide more convenience for guests without direct intervention from hotel staff. These technologies include systems such as in-room checkout systems, <b>in-room</b> <b>entertainment</b> systems, on demand printing services, lobby kiosks, and online reservation systems. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine and quantify the factors that impact hotel guests 2 ̆ 7 intentions to seek and utilize guest empowerment technologies. This study found that the factors of individual characteristics, technology characteristics, task characteristics, fit, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness have a significant impact on intention to use. The contribution of this research is both academic and practical. First, this study will be among the first to examine and test determinants of guests 2 ̆ 7 intentions to utilize guest empowerment technologies. In addition, this study will expand upon the current body of knowledge in the areas of self-service technology acceptance, perceived ease of use of self-service technology, perceived usefulness of self-service technology, and improve the understanding of the relationships among perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, intentions to use, task characteristics, technology characteristics, individual characteristics, and fit. The third contribution this study will make is through the development and extension of a multidimensional instrument to measure perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, intentions to use, task characteristics, technology characteristics, individual characteristics, and fit...|$|E
