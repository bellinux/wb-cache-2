The levels of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide (CO 2), respirable suspended particulate matter, nicotine, and solanesol were monitored at three locations within three nursing homes: a designated smoking room with an independent ventilation system, the adjacent hallway and outside the building. The concentrations of air contaminants, except CO 2, inside the designated smoking rooms were significantly higher than those in the hallways or outside. The concentration of CO 2 was similar in the smoking rooms and the hallways but significantly higher than the concentration outside. The levels of ambient air temperature or relative humidity within the three locations were not generally different. The results indicated that the designation of a smoking room with an independent ventilation system was effective in controlling the environmental tobacco smoke in these nursing homes...|$|E
40|$|Tobacco {{control policy}} has been enacted in many jurisdictions {{worldwide}} banning smoking in the workplace. In the hospitality sector many businesses such as bars, hotels and restaurants have installed designated smoking areas on their premises and allowance for such smoking areas {{has been made in}} the tobacco control legislation of many countries. An investigation was carried out into the level of exposure to ETS present in 8 pubs in Ireland which included designated smoking areas complying with two different definitions of a smoking area set out in Irish legislation. In addition, ETS exposure in a pub with a <b>designated</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>area</b> not in compliance with the legislation was also investigated. The results of this investigation showed that the two differing definitions of a smoking area present in pubs produced similar concentrations of benzene within smoking areas (5. 1 - 5. 4 ?g/m 3) but differing concentrations within the `smoke-free? areas (1. 42 - 3. 01 ?g/m 3). Smoking areas in breach of legislative definitions were found to produce the highest levels of benzene in the smoking area (49. 5 ?g/m 3) and `smoke-free? area (7. 68 ?g/m 3). 3 D exposure modelling of hypothetical smoking areas showed that a wide range of ETS exposure concentrations were possible in smoking areas with the same floor area and same smoking rate but differing height to width and length to width ratios.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoke has {{compounds}} {{that are known}} as human carcinogens. With every breath of secondhand smoke we inhale thousands of chemicals. The Government of India {{in the interest of}} public health has enacted the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA), 2003, which bans smoking in all the public places including hotels and restaurants. The {{purpose of this study was}} to observe and record air pollution in smoke free and smoke observed locations and thereby find out whether the owners/managers of hotels, restaurants, and bars comply with rules of COTPA. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to measure and compare the level of particulate air pollution from secondhand smoke (PM 2. 5) in smoking and nonsmoking venues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted from September 2009 to March 2010 in Karnataka, India following a nonrandom sample of 79 locations, which included restaurants, bars, cafes, hotels, and tea stalls in two districts. The concentration of PM 2. 5 was measured using a TSI SidePak AM 510 Personal Aerosol Monitor. RESULTS: In Karnataka out of the 79 hospitality locations, smoking was observed in 58 % places and only 28 % had displayed the required “No Smoking” signage. Places where indoor smoking was observed had high levels of air pollution with average 135 PM 2. 5, which were 3. 1 times higher than the average 43 PM 2. 5 in smoke-free locations and 14 times higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) target air quality guideline for PM 2. 5. The average PM 2. 5 levels in different locations ranged from 11 to 417 μg/m 3 and was lower in the case of apparently compliant <b>designated</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>area</b> (DSR). CONCLUSIONS: The patrons and the workers in the hospitality sector continue to be exposed to secondhand smoke despite the enactment of COTPA, which bans smoking in public places. This situation demands stringent measures for effective implementation of the Smoke Free Act and negative response to smoking among civil society...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Smoke-free {{policy is}} an {{effective}} tobacco control measure. Current legislation of Ukraine requires {{at least half of}} the premises of cafes, restaurants, and bars to be smoke-free provided that tobacco smoke does not penetrate from the <b>smoking</b> <b>areas.</b> METHODS: Data on fine particulate matter air pollution was collected in 28 facilities from December 2011 through January 2012 according to the international protocol with the use of Sidepak Aerosol Monitor. Characteristics of the facilities were recorded along with the data on whether smoking was observed. Height, length and width of premises were measured as well. To analyze factors that affect air pollution, generalized linear model utility in SPSS 15. 0 was used. Results are presented as 95 %confidence intervals of particulate matter concentrations. RESULTS: Among 25 facilities with <b>designated</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> only nine had areas for non-smokers larger than the <b>designated</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>areas.</b> Particulate matter air concentrations in those three facilities where all the premises were smoke-free constituted 82 - 94 µ/m 3. Concentrations in rooms for non-smokers and smokers in facilities with thoroughly divided premises were 144 - 158 µ/m 3 and 411 - 625 µ/m 3 respectively and in those without the division 384 - 436 µ/m 3 in premises for non-smokers and 471 - 537 µ/m 3 where smoking was allowed. With other factors controlled (facility size, type – bar present or not, ventilation, smoking occurring or not), there was no significant difference in concentrations between those premises where smoking was allowed and where it wasn’t if the facility was not totally smoke-free. CONCLUSION: Current legislation of Ukraine which requires <b>designated</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> does not protect visitors against tobacco smoke, as it does penetrate to the non-smoking areas in most of the examined facilities of Donetsk.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to measure secondhand tobacco (including kretek) smoke (SHS) {{concentrations}} in public places in Jakarta, Bogor, and Palembang before laws banning smoking in public spaces went into effect. Methods: Particulate matter (PM 2. 5) was measured in 15 hospitals, 15 government offices, 30 restaurants, and 26 entertainment venues throughout the three cities. Also, in Jakarta, vapor-phase nicotine was measured in 5 schools, 5 hospitals, 5 government offices, 9 restaurants, and 10 entertainment venues. Data were analyzed descriptively. Differences by city and venue characteristics were analyzed by Student’s t-test, ANOVA, and Bonferroni pairwise statistical tests. Results: Geometric mean PM 2. 5 levels were highest in entertainment venues (96 μg/m 3), followed by restaurants (78 μg/m 3), government offices (57 μg/m 3), and hospitals (46 μg/m 3). Air nicotine levels in Jakarta were highest in <b>designated</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> (4. 71 μg/m 3) and designated non-smoking areas (1. 55 μg/m 3) of entertainment venues. These were followed by government offices (0. 30 μg/m 3), <b>designated</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> (0. 24 μg/m 3) and designated non-smoking areas (0. 19 μg/m 3) of restaurants, hospitals (0. 01 μg/m 3), and schools (0. 01 μg/m 3). Conclusion: SHS was detected in all venues in the three cities in Indonesia. High levels of air nicotine were found in non-smoking areas of restaurants and entertainment venues, indicating that <b>designated</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> are not an effective solution to eliminate SHS. There is no safe level of SHS exposure and thus SHS in these venues increases the risk of adverse health effects among children and adults. These findings support the need for 100 % smoke-free laws covering all public venues in these and other Indonesian cities.

40|$|Secondhand smoke (SHS) {{exposure}} causes {{death and}} disease among nonsmoking {{adults and children}} (1). Adopting policies that completely prohibit smoking in all indoor areas is the only effective way to eliminate involuntary SHS exposure (1). Among the 29 large-hub U. S. airports, five currently allow <b>smoking</b> in specifically <b>designated</b> indoor areas accessible {{to the general public}} (2). In 2011, these five airports had a combined passenger boarding of approximately 110 million (3). To assess indoor air quality at the five large-hub U. S. airports with <b>designated</b> indoor <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> and compare it with the indoor air quality at four large-hub U. S. airports that prohibit smoking in all indoor areas, CDC measured the levels of respirable suspended particulates (RSPs), a marker for SHS. The results of this assessment determined that the average level of RSPs in the smoking-permitted areas of these five airports was 16 times the average level in nonsmoking areas (boarding gate seating sections) and 23 times the average level of RSPs in the smoke-free airports. The average RSP level in areas adjacent to the smoking-permitted areas was four times the average level in nonsmoking areas of the five airports with <b>designated</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>areas</b> and five times the average level in smoke-free airports.

The {{objective of the}} study is to assess the prevalence of smoking control policies (total ban, <b>smoking</b> permission and <b>designated</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>areas)</b> adopted by the LH sector in Portugal. The levels of noncompliance with each policy are investigated as well as the main factors associated with smoking permission and noncompliance with the law. Cross-sectional study conducted between January 2010 and May 2011. A random sample of venues was selected from the Portuguese LH sector database, proportionally stratified according to type, size and geographical area. All venues were assessed in loco by an observer. The independent effects of venues' characteristics on smoking permission and the level of noncompliance with the law were explored using logistic regression. Overall, 1. 412 venues were included. Total ban policy was adopted by 75. 9 % of venues, while 8. 4 % had <b>designated</b> <b>smoking</b> <b>areas.</b> <b>Smoking</b> ban was more prevalent in restaurants (85. 9 %). Only 29. 7 % of discos/bars/pubs opted for complete ban. Full or partial smoking permission was higher in discos/bar/pubs (OR =  7. 37; 95 %CI 4. 87 to 11. 17). Noncompliance with the law was higher in venues allowing smoking and lower in places with complete ban (33. 6 % and 7. 6 % respectively, p< 0. 001). Discos/bars/pubs with full smoking permission had the highest level of noncompliance (OR =  3. 31; 95 %CI 1. 40 to 7. 83). Our findings show a high adherence to smoking ban policy by the Portuguese LH sector. Nonetheless, one quarter of the venues is fully or partially permissive towards smoking, with the discos/bars/pubs considerably contributing to this situation. Venues with smoking permission policies were less compliant with the legislation.
