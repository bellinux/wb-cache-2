Based {{on the principle that}} reasonable geometric parameters designs of welded joints can regulate the distribution of stress and strain, reduce the stress concentration factors in low strength weld zone, the geometric parameters of undermatching butt joints, such as weld toe radius, height of <b>excess</b> <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> and width of the cover passes are designed. A series of tests were completed to investigate the effect of weld shape design on the mechanical properties and security of undermatching butt joints. The results showed that the critical crack sizes of the 0. 6 ~ 1. 0 undermatching joints is {{greater than or equal to}} the one of base metal, the joints strengths approach to the tensile strength of base mental, and the fatigue strength is far higher than that of the as-welded equalmatching butt joints...|$|E

Nevertheless they can produce a set of drawbacks like difficulty to assembly, reworking, limited fatigue life, and surface imperfections. In this paper Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium butt welds were produced by CO 2 laser welding. The following tolerable defects were analysed: weld undercut, <b>excess</b> <b>weld</b> <b>metal,</b> excessive penetration, incomplete filled groove, root concavity, and lack of penetration. A neuro-fuzzy model for the prediction and classification of the defects in the fused zone was built up using the experimental data. Weld imperfections were connected to the welding parameters by feed forward neural networks. Then the imperfections were clustered using the C-means fuzzy clustering algorithm. The clusters were named after the ISO standard classification of the levels of imperfection for electron and laser beam welding of aluminium alloys and steels.

The mechanical properties of the <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy were used {{to carry out the}} fractography investigation of the impacted specimens. In the 5 % Cr steel <b>weld</b> <b>metal,</b> it was found that M 7 C 3 and M 2 C started to precipitate during tempering at 500 °C. M 23 C 6 precipitated out from 600 °C. The composition of the precipitates also changed according to the tempering temperature. The development of microstructure during tempering was discussed. The microstructure of three 9 % Cr steel <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> consisted of lath martensite, some retained. delta. -ferrite and precipitates. The predominant precipitates were M 23 C 6. In <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> containing V and Nb, MC and M 2 C were present. The failure mode of the impacted <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> was quasi-cleavage. Non- metallic inclusions were found to be the nucleation sites for cleavage cracks during impact. The cleavage stress of the <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> was determined {{by the size of the}} inclusions and the size of martensite packets or recrystallized ferrite grains (in the case that the quantity of recrystallized ferrite was high). The impact toughness of the <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> depended on the yield stress and fracture stress of the materials. The microstructure of three varieties of 12 % Cr steel <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> consisted also of martensite, retained. delta. -ferrite and precipitates. The precipitates included M 23 C 6, MX and M 2 X. The morphology, quantity and distribution of the precipitates were determined by composition and heat treatment of the <b>weld</b> <b>metals.</b> The microstructure development in the <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> in different heat treatment conditions was investigated. The failure mode of impacted specimens was mainly cleavage. Intercooling the <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> to 125 °C before post-weld heat treatment did not affect the tensile strength of the <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> very much, but improved their impact toughness dramatically.

The grain refiner additions led to a significant reduction of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> mean grain size (Alloy 1050 A, 86 %; Alloy 5083, 44 %) with a change in grain shape from columnar to equiaxed.

40|$|Hydrogen induced cold {{cracking}} in weldments {{is the most}} serious problem limiting the use of high strength low alloy steel in the structural industry. Improvement of the weldability of structural steel has significantly reduced the risk of {{cold cracking}} in the heat affected zone. Consequently, the avoidance of <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> cold cracking becomes a major task since the risk of hydrogen induced cold cracking in the HAZ is greatly diminished in modem low carbon steels. Hydrogen induced cold cracking in <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> is caused by the complex interaction of the diffusible hydrogen content, residual stress and susceptible microstructure. Depending on the joint geometry which induces stresses, cold cracking in <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> can be of two types with respect to the welding direction: longitudinal cracking which is parallel to the welding direction, and transverse cracking which is perpendicular to the welding direction. Weld deposits for high strength low alloy steels can be susceptible to transverse cold cracking. The investigation described in this thesis involved the use of the gapped bead-on-plate (G-BOP) test to examine the effect of shielding gas mixture and preheat temperature on <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> transverse cold cracking behaviour in a flux cored arc welded BIS 812 EMA quenched and tempered steel. The minimum yield stress of BIS 812 EMA steel 1 s 690 MPa. The consumable used in welding was a low hydrogen flux cored wire. Literature relevant to the characteristics of <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> cold cracking has been reviewed, with emphasis on the factors affecting hydrogen induced cold cracking. The process of flux cored arc welding, the weld thermal cycle and the properties of <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> have been examined. The main types of cold cracking and relevant weldability tests have been discussed. Two different Ar-C 02 shielding gas mixtures (Ar- 5 %C 02 and Ar- 20 %C 02) and five different preheat temperatures (20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C) were used at an aim heat input of 1. 7 kJ/mm to investigate the effect of welding conditions on the transverse cold cracking behaviour of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited on BIS 812 EMA steel. The microstructures, hardness values and fracture surfaces of the <b>weld</b> <b>metals,</b> have been examined in detail using optical and electron microscopy and microhardness testing. The characteristics of non-metallic inclusions in the <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> have been determined using scanning electron microscopy and automatic image analysis. The continuous cooling transformation diagrams of the base <b>metal</b> and the <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> have been developed using dilatometry and microstructural observation. Additionally, precipitation hardening by alloy carbides has been studied by tempering of <b>weld</b> <b>metals.</b> It was found that, below a critical preheat temperature, <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> transverse cracks developed in the self restrained G-BOP test at least five minutes after welding and initiated below 150 °C, confirming that the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> transverse cracking was cold cracking. Shielding with Ar- 20 %C 02 mixture resulted in significantly lower susceptibility to transverse cold cracking than shielding with Ar- 5 %C 02 mixture. However, the microstructures of the <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> deposited with the two different Ar-C 02 shielding gas mixtures were similar and mainly consisted of acicular ferrite and bainitic ferrite. Comparing the two <b>weld</b> <b>metals,</b> the higher oxygen potential of the Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture caused reduction of hardenability elements such as carbon, boron, manganese and silicon in the weld metal; and the higher oxygen absorption during welding resulted in a higher non-metallic inclusion volume fraction and a slightly larger mean particle size and number of particles per unit volume. These factors led to phase transformation during cooling at higher temperature in <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02, a slightly coarser microstructure with more bainitic ferrite, and a significantly lower hardness than the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02. In addition, the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture had a lower diffusible hydrogen level and less nitrogen in solid solution. These characteristics combined with the lower hardness value of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> are considered to be the main factors contributing to the lower susceptibility to transverse cold cracking in the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 compared with Ar- 5 %C 02 under the same welding conditions. Three types of fracture morphologies were found {{to be associated with the}} <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> transverse cold cracking: microvoid coalescence (MVC) fracture, quasi-cleavage (QC) fracture and intergranular (IG) fracture. IG was more prevalent in the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02 shielding gas mixture while MVC dominated in the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02. These trends are consistent with the difference in <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> hardness (strength). The susceptibility to <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> transverse cold cracking, based on the G-BOP test, decreased with increasing preheat temperature for both shielding gas mixtures. No cracking was observed for the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture for a preheat of 40 °C, but a preheat of 100 °C was required for crack-free welding using Ar- 5 %C 02 shielding gas mixture. However, it is concluded that the finer microstructure of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02 is capable of both higher strength and lower cold cracking susceptibility than the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 provided the hardnesses are similar and below a critical level of about 290 HV...|$|R

Experimental measurements were made as samples were austenitized at 1040 °C, cooled to room temperature at 6 °C/min, tempered at 740 °C, and cooled a second time to room temperature. The data show that transformation of austenite to martensite was completed in the base metal during cooling from 1040 °C. In contrast, the initial cooling from 1040 °C did not completely transform austenite in the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> to martensite. Austenite retained in the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> was stable during the tempering treatment and only transformed to martensite during the final cooling stage. The diffraction data also showed that the austenite lattice parameter in the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> decreased during the tempering treatment. This observation {{was consistent with the}} retained austenite having a higher MS than it did during the initial cooling. Computational thermodynamics modeling was used to predict that the elements, C, Cr, Mn and Ni, that influence transformation temperatures in this alloy strongly partition to interdendritic regions during solidification. The stability of retained austenite in the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> during the thermal cycle and its transformation behavior were attributed to the effects of microsegregation. After the final cooling from the tempering treatment the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> will contain a small amount of untempered martensite...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} numerical {{studies on}} strength mis-match effects in welded joints. Crack growth in a mis-matched single edge notched specimen under pure bending, with a crack lying {{at the center}} line of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal,</b> is simulated via a two-dimensional plane strain finite element analysis (FEA). The fracture process is modeled using a cohesive zone model (CZM). The work is focussed {{on the effects of}} yield strength mis-match as well as thickness of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> on fracture resistance and load-deformation for both under- and overmatched specimens. <b>Weld</b> <b>metal</b> mis-match is achieved by keeping the same <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> and changing the strength of the base metal.

40|$|Fracture {{toughness}} of a {{damage tolerant}} Ti 6 Al 4 V (TC 4 -DT) alloy and its electron beam welded joint was investigated using compact tension specimens. Moreover tensile test microhardness test and microstructure examination were carried out. The result {{indicates that the}} <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> is strength overmatching. The tensile strength and microhardness of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> are {{higher than those of}} the base metal but the ductility and the energy absorbed before fracture are lower. In addition the fracture toughness K 1 c of the base metal is relatively high. The fracture toughness of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> decreases compared with the base metal. It is expected that the toughness reduction of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> is mainly related to the as solidified coarse β columnar grain structure containing martensite in comparison with the bimodal structure of the base metal. Moreover fractographic observation shows that the fracture mode of both <b>weld</b> and base <b>metals</b> is found to be ductile. © 2012 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Simulation {{model of a}} columnar grain aggregate was generated based on a crystal orientation measurement result by electron backscatter diffraction method. Microscopic stress much higher than applied macroscopic stress was observed when load was applied along transverse direction of columnar grain growth direction. On the other hand, homogeneous microscopic stress was obtained in a columnar grain model when macroscopic stress was applied in columnar grain growth direction.

40|$|The {{influence}} of filler <b>metals</b> used in <b>welding</b> wires on the phase and chemical {{composition of the}} metal, which is surfaced to mining equipment exposed to abrasive wear, has been investigated. Under a laboratory environment, samples of Mo-V-B and Cr-Mn-Mo-V wires were made. The performed experiments have revealed that fillers of the Cr-Mn-Mo-V system used in powder wire show better wear resistance of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> {{than that of the}} Mn-Mo-V-B system; the absence of boron, which promotes grain refinement in the Mn-Mo-V-B system, significantly reduces wear resistance; the Mn-Mo-V-B <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> has a finer structure than the Cr-Mn-Mo-V <b>weld</b> <b>metal...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} and properties of welds made in molybdenum alloy VM- 1 {{as a function}} of rhenium concentrations in the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> were studied. Rhenium was introduced into the weld using rhenium wire and tape or wires of Mo- 47 Re and Mo- 52 Re alloys. The properties of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> were studied by means of metallographic techniques, electron microscopy, X-ray analysis, and autoradiography. The plasticity of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> sharply was found to increase with increasing concentration of rhenium up to 50 %.

40|$|<b>Weld</b> <b>metal</b> {{strength}} and toughness are determined by its microstructure, which is in turn determined by the concentration of various alloying elements and impurities {{as well as the}} welding thermal cycle. This study investigated the effects of systematically varying the manganese oxide content in the flux used for HY-l 00 submerged arc welds. A trial addition of cerium oxide was also performed. Specimens were compared using mechanical properties, <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> chemistry, inclusion chemistry, and microstructural analysis. It was found that cerium oxide addition and the correct amount of manganese oxide resulted in improved toughness. These improved properties were determined to arise from a low proportion of bainite in the fully reaustenitized region of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> HAZ in these multipass welds. In the MnO series welds, the bainite is replaced by a fine low carbon martensite due to the increased <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> hardenability. In the CeO 2 weld it is replaced by acicular ferrite due to the lowering of the austenite grain boundary energy by the cerium. The production of a series of welds with different manganese contents also resulted in the extension of existing theories of <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deoxidation. p 3. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S.

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} was first, to evaluate the residual stresses in members which have been welded by various methods and second, to determine the effect whichstress relieving has upon them. Four types of weld were considered in each case, these being: (1) <b>Weld</b> <b>Metal</b> deposited in one layer with bare electrodes. (2) <b>Weld</b> <b>Metal</b> deposited in two layers with bare electrodes. (3) <b>Weld</b> <b>Metal</b> deposited in one layer with covered electrodes. (4) <b>Weld</b> <b>Metal</b> deposited in two layers with covered electrodes. The specimens in all cases were mild steel plates 12 inches wide, 3 / 4 inches thick and 21 inches long with the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> deposited in "U" shaped grooves in the long sides of the plate. The deformation caused by welding was first recorded after which the specimens were severed into strips in order to measure the elastic residual stresses throughout the various plates. It was found that the stresses in the welds varied from about 10, 000 to 40, 000 Ibs. per square inch and that, after stress relieving, the stresses in every case were reduced to less than 5, 000 Ibs. per square inch...|$|R
