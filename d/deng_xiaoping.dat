5|$|Lee's {{programs}} in Singapore {{had a profound}} effect on the Communist leadership in China, who made a major effort, especially under <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping,</b> to emulate his policies of economic growth, entrepreneurship, and subtle suppression of dissent. Over 22,000 Chinese officials were sent to Singapore to study its methods.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Nixon {{published}} his memoirs, RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, {{the first of}} ten books he was to author in his retirement. The book was a bestseller and attracted a generally positive critical response. Nixon visited the White House in 1979, invited by Carter for the state dinner for Chinese Vice Premier <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping.</b> Carter had not wanted to invite Nixon, but Deng had stated he would visit Nixon in California if the former president was not invited. Nixon had a private meeting with Deng and visited Beijing again in mid-1979.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the Eighth National Congress, held in September 1956, Peng attended a Politburo committee to redraft the new Party Constitution. At this meeting, Peng suggested that a section in the Constitution's preamble referring to Mao Zedong Thought be removed. Liu Shaoqi, <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping,</b> Peng Zhen, and most other senior CCP members present quickly agreed, and it {{was removed from the}} final version of the 1956 Party Constitution. At the Congress, Peng was re-appointed to the Politburo and as a full member of the Central Committee.|$|E
5|$|In September 1982 {{she visited}} China {{to discuss with}} <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping</b> the {{sovereignty}} of Hong Kong after 1997. China was the first communist state Thatcher had visited {{and she was the}} first British prime minister to visit China. Throughout their meeting, she sought the PRC's agreement to a continued British presence in the territory. Deng insisted that the PRC's sovereignty on Hong Kong was non-negotiable, but stated his willingness to settle the sovereignty issue with the British government through formal negotiations, and both governments promised to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. After the two-year negotiations, Thatcher conceded to the PRC government and signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration in Beijing in 1984, agreeing to hand over Hong Kong's sovereignty in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Lê Thanh, unsuccessfully visited China in August 1975 to seek aid. On 22–28 September, Lê Duẩn and Lê Duẩn Thanh visited China in {{a second}} attempt. During the visit the Vietnamese wanted to assure the Chinese they were {{interested}} in maintaining good relations with both China and the Soviet Union. <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping</b> stated that both superpowers acted as imperialists and sought hegemony. Lê Duẩn in a speech did not mention the Soviet Union by name, but noted that Vietnam had succeeded because of help from other socialist countries, meaning the Eastern bloc. Two agreements were signed, but no non-refundable aid agreement was made. No joint communique was issued and Lê Duẩn left earlier than planned. According to Anne Gilks, the Sino/Vietnamese alliance effectively ended with the Fall of Saigon. Relations with China further deteriorated; several leading pro-Chinese communists were purged from the party.|$|E
5|$|After the Khmer Rouge {{regime was}} overthrown, a new Cambodian {{government}} supported by Vietnam, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), was established. The Chinese leader, <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping,</b> {{was unhappy with}} Vietnam's influence over the PRK government. Deng proposed to Sihanouk that he co-operate with the Khmer Rouge to overthrow the PRK government, but rejected it, as he opposed the genocidal policies pursued by the Khmer Rouge {{while they were in}} power. In March 1981 Sihanouk established a resistance movement, FUNCINPEC which was complemented by a small resistance army known as Armée Nationale Sihanoukiste (ANS). He appointed In Tam, who had briefly served as Prime Minister in the Khmer Republic, as the commander-in-chief of ANS. The ANS needed military aid from China, and Deng seized the opportunity to sway Sihanouk into collaborating with the Khmer Rouge. Sihanouk reluctantly agreed, and started talks in March 1981 with the Khmer Rouge and the Son Sann-led Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) on a unified anti-PRK resistance movement.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy and {{his wife}} Joan {{separated}} in 1977, although they still staged joint appearances at some public events. He held Health and Scientific Research Subcommittee hearings in March 1977 that led to public revelations of extensive scientific misconduct by contract research organizations, including Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories. Kennedy visited China on a goodwill mission in late December 1977, meeting with leader <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping</b> and eventually gaining permission {{for a number of}} Mainland Chinese nationals to leave the country; in 1978, he also visited the Soviet Union and Brezhnev and dissidents there again. During the 1970s, Kennedy also showed interest in nuclear disarmament, and as part of his efforts in this field even visited Hiroshima in January 1978 and gave a public speech to that effect at Hiroshima University. He became chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1978, by which time he had amassed a wide-ranging Senate staff of a hundred.|$|E
5|$|From {{this point}} onwards Sihanouk was kept {{under house arrest}} at the royal palace. In September 1978 he was removed to another {{apartment}} in Phnom Penh's suburbs, where he lived {{until the end of}} the year. Throughout his confinement, Sihanouk made several unsuccessful requests to the Angkar to travel overseas. On New Year's Day of 1979, Sihanouk was taken from Phnom Penh to Sisophon, where they stayed for three days until 5January, when they were taken back to Phnom Penh. Sihanouk was taken to meet Pol Pot, who briefed him on the Angkar's plans to repulse Vietnamese troops, which had since invaded parts of eastern Cambodia in December 1978. On 6January 1979, Sihanouk flew to Beijing from Phnom Penh, where he was greeted by Zhou Enlai's successor, <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping.</b> Three days later, Sihanouk flew from Beijing to New York to attend the UN Security Council, where he simultaneously condemned the Khmer Rouge for orchestrating the Cambodian genocide as well as the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. Sihanouk subsequently sought asylum in China after making two unsuccessful asylum applications with the US and France.|$|E
25|$|It became {{increasingly}} clear to Hua that, without <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping,</b> {{it was difficult}} to continue daily affairs of state. On October 10, <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping</b> personally wrote a letter to Hua asking to be transferred back to state and party affairs; party elders also called for Deng's return. With increasing pressure from all sides, Hua named Deng Vice-Premier in July 1977, and later promoted him to various other positions, effectively catapulting Deng to China's second-most powerful figure. In August, the Party's Eleventh Congress was held in Beijing, officially naming (in ranking order) Hua Guofeng, Ye Jianying, <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping,</b> Li Xiannian, and Wang Dongxing as new members of the Politburo Standing Committee.|$|E

25|$|Margaret Thatcher, in {{discussion}} with <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping,</b> reiterated {{the validity of}} {{an extension of the}} lease of Hong Kong territory, particularly in light of binding treaties, including the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, the Convention of Peking in 1856, and the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory signed in 1890.|$|E
25|$|During the pre-reform period, Chinese {{agricultural}} {{performance was}} extremely poor and food shortages were common. After <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping</b> implemented the household responsibility system, agricultural output increased by 8.2% a year, compared with 2.7% in the pre-reform period, despite {{a decrease in}} the area of land used. Food prices fell nearly 50%, while agricultural incomes rose.|$|E
25|$|Economic reforms {{began after}} <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping</b> and his reformist allies ousted the Gang of Four Maoist faction.

25|$|At {{party or}} civil meetings, {{the usage of}} the term has been retained.

25|$|The {{effects on}} the upper levels of {{government}} {{in response to the}} disaster were complex, with Mao purging the Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai in 1959, the temporary promotion of Lin Biao, Liu Shaoqi, and <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping,</b> and Mao losing some power and prestige following the Great Leap Forward, which led him to launch the Cultural Revolution in 1966.|$|E
25|$|During Bo's {{career he}} held {{successive}} posts as Communist China's inaugural Minister of Finance, {{a member of}} the Communist Party's Politburo, Vice-Premier, chairman of State Economic Commission, and vice-chairman of the party's Central Advisory Commission. Bo was purged in 1966 by the Mao-backed Gang of Four, but he was brought back to power by <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping</b> in the late 1970s, after Mao's death.|$|E
25|$|In {{subsequent}} {{conferences in}} March 1960 and May 1962, {{the negative effects}} of the Great Leap Forward were studied by the CPC, and Mao was criticized in the party conferences. Moderate Party members like President Liu Shaoqi and <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping</b> rose to power, and Chairman Mao was marginalized within the party, leading him to initiate the Cultural Revolution in 1966.|$|E
25|$|Under <b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping,</b> new {{policies}} in China's economy shifted the approach from collective farming to household-based production quotas, {{in many ways}} reversing decades of collectivization efforts. In many areas of China, especially southern and coastal China, {{the standard of living}} improved dramatically after Deng's reforms. Township and Village Enterprises brought industrial production to rural areas—predominantly along the souther coasts—helping open these rural communities to greater economic prosperity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Deng</b> <b>Xiaoping</b> disliked {{all three}} leaders, and {{directed}} Hu to dismiss {{them from the}} Party in order to silence them, but Hu refused.
