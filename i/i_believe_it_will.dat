25|$|It's like St. Patrick's Day. I {{came out}} of respect for what my people are doing, not because <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> do any good. I thought it would do some good in the beginning. But when the march started to get all the {{official}} approval from Mastah Kennedy, Mastah Wagner, Mastah Spellman, and they started setting limits on how we had to march peacefully, I knew that the march {{was going to be a}} mockery, that they were giving us something again.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{candidate}} for governor in 2002, Romney proposed indexing the minimum wage to inflation and raising the hourly pay for the state's lowest-paid workers from $6.75 an hour to $6.96 an hour starting January 2004, saying, [...] "I {{do not believe that}} indexing the minimum wage will cost us jobs. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> help us retain jobs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{resisted}} calls by {{some officers}} to reject surrender and allow small units to melt {{away into the}} mountains, setting up a lengthy guerrilla war. He insisted {{the war was over}} and energetically campaigned for inter-sectional reconciliation. [...] "So far from engaging in a war to perpetuate slavery, I am rejoiced that slavery is abolished. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be greatly for the interests of the South." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I {{should be}} delighted to have you. Mr. Dickery's going, and Jenny Dickery, and Barbara. <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> rain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! Charlie, how very, kind! How thankful poor Laura {{will be to}} you! <b>I</b> do <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> save him!' cried Amabel, eagerly.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{economic}} crisis we face is real. However, I {{voted against the}} bailout because it isn't paid for and because <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> work.|$|R
60|$|And I've had second, third, {{and seventh}} {{thoughts}} about several things: {{as it is}} coming out <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be a useful contribution to the book.|$|E
6000|$|... "Since {{you are so}} caustically-disposed, Mowbray," [...] {{answered}} the Earl, [...] "I presume you will not honour her ladyship's tea-table to-night, though <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be {{the last of the}} season?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pensioned her, eh? Well, {{this is good}} news, Di; {{perhaps the}} best news in the world. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> help clear up the situation. Old Cerise and I always {{understood}} each other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> get {{as bad as}} all that, Randy," [...] said Jack. [...] "This {{looks as}} if it was a pretty {{substantial}} building." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>will,</b> Jacob. And <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>'ll</b> do {{you good}} to set up. I wished I {{could set up}} with you; but I don't {{seem to have the}} stren'th I did when the twins died. I must git my sleep, so's to--I don't like very well to have you broke of your rest, Jacob, but there don't appear to be anybody else. You wouldn't have to do it if Coonrod was here. There I go ag'in! Mercy! mercy!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pshaw! Florence--all sentiment: {{poor people}} {{have no time to}} be sentimental. Besides, <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> grow with them; it is a {{greenhouse}} flower, and used to delicate living." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An {{attempt was}} made, {{a few years}} since, to turn the whole country into towns, and, among other places, the Neck; but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> never be {{anything}} more than a capital farm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{a little}} letter for that young fire-brand up stairs, and, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> clear up the mystery. Clarke gave it to Sam last fall and Sam never gave it to Betty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why not?' said Masham; 'she is yet a girl, {{and with}} a {{prospect}} of a long life. She must have a future, and I hope, and <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> yet be a happy one.' ...|$|E
6000|$|HOWARD. [...] See, This {{comes of}} parleying with my Lord of Devon. Well, well, you must obey; and <b>I</b> myself <b>Believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> {{be better for}} your welfare. Your time will come.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not much {{danger of}} that,' said Sophy, smiling. 'Well, <b>I</b> can't <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be your lot all your life. You will find some {{one who will}} know how to love you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are in {{for more}} trouble from the Wyandots and Shawnees. But, Bessie, <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> come soon. We are too well {{protected}} here for anything but a protracted siege." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it isn't likely. But <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> happen. I have a queer, creepy, crawly feeling--you {{can call}} it a presentiment, if you like--that 'Patty's Place' and I {{are going to be}} better acquainted yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will,</b> my boy. I had {{intended}} to {{get some sort of}} covering for my dear Ailie put up in the stern-sheets; but I did not think of absolutely making a box for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{said not}} so, yet <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be well if {{those who have}} thus advised Master Lillie keep {{the fact that they}} were {{concerned}} in the work a secret. Who is that now coming from the house?" ...|$|E
6000|$|As little Mrs. Peter stopped speaking, Peter {{sprang to}} his feet. [...] "The very thing!" [...] he cried. [...] "It's {{sort of a}} Golden Rule, and <b>I</b> do <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not very much," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "Laura has bowled a few games, <b>I</b> <b>believe.</b> But <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be fun {{to teach}} them, if we don't find anything better to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{the bitter}} end. Yes; I {{understand}} {{the conditions of}} your uncompromising conscience. But <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be any such killing matter. There are other semi-detached girls in the house; she could go round with them." ...|$|R
60|$|MARTHA--[More {{and more}} stung by their {{strained}} attitudes and inquisitive glances. Coldly and cuttingly.] Finely, thank you. The book will cause quite a stir, <b>I</b> <b>believe.</b> <b>It</b> <b>will</b> make {{the name of}} Jayson famous in the big world outside of Bridgetown.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> {{be found}} that the entirely unimaginative mind sees nothing of the object it has to dwell upon or describe, and is {{therefore}} utterly unable, as it is blind itself, to set anything before {{the eyes of the}} reader.[56] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{may feel}} some surprise, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> vanish {{when they have}} seen her; and I choose my wife to please myself. I think I have means enough to make my way without any help, though I haven't a great deal." ...|$|E
6000|$|At about eleven o'clock, however, a few {{specks of}} small rain upon the windows caught Catherine's watchful eye, and [...] "Oh! dear, <b>I</b> do <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be wet," [...] broke from {{her in a}} most desponding tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, old fellow," [...] said Foy consolingly. [...] "It {{all went}} wrong, thanks to you, {{and thanks to}} you <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> all come right again. So we will cry quits and forget the rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eccellenza, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it,</b> and <b>will</b> {{try to be}} brief. I wish to beg my grandfather's life of this illustrious stranger. They tell me {{the king}} will refuse him nothing, and he has only to ask it of Don Ferdinando to obtain it." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{order to}} remove these misapprehensions among us, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be {{necessary}} upon occasion, {{to detect the}} malice and falsehood of some popular maxims, which those idiots scatter from the press twice a week, and draw an hundred absurd consequences from them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Care for it!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I am {{enlisted in}} the cause, hand and heart. I came down here because the bill was to be brought before the House. If the college is established,--and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be,--I expect {{to be one of}} the faculty." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{assured her}} he had not, and proffered a request. [...] "Don't let us tell each other anything, Mrs. Travers. Don't let us think of anything. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> {{be the best way}} to get over the evening." [...] There was real anxiety in his jesting tone.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{go down to}} the Old Briar-patch. <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be of much use, but {{you never}} can tell until you try. Peter Rabbit may take it into his silly head to come outside," [...] said Granny, leading the way.|$|R
6000|$|... "How happy they look, {{sitting there}} together!" [...] said the Dryad; [...] "and <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> do {{them a bit}} of harm to be still younger." [...] And moving quietly up behind them, she first kissed Old Pipes on his cheek and then his mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, look here, children, {{you just}} come {{and tell me}} all your worries, and with God's help, I'll settle them for you. That is what I'm here for, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be a great {{happiness}} to {{me if you can}} trust me." ...|$|R
