40|$|The {{neurodegenerative}} disease glaucoma {{is one of}} the leading causes of blindness and accounts for over ten million visits to physicians for treatment. Unfortunately, there is yet to be a concrete accepted approach to alleviating the effects of glaucoma. This dissertation examines recent studies and reports on the specifics of viral vectors, non-viral vectors, piezoelectric inkjet <b>printing,</b> <b>heat</b> inkjet <b>printing,</b> and glaucoma. A few of the studies involve the progression of an experiment while others combine and discuss the results of multiple experiments. Using these articles I compared the effectiveness of gene therapy to the use of inkjet printing to create retinal cells. By replacing, adding, or deleting a specific sequence in the human body, the gene expression of the eye can be altered. There are two different types of injections for gene therapy, viral vectors and non-viral vectors. Both methods typically target the trabecular meshwork and neuroretina to regulate the aqueous humor outflow and lower the intraocular pressure. In the case of glaucoma, the treatment solely provides neuroprotection instead of curing the disease, thus patients must undergo repeated injections in order to keep the disease from deteriorating. Inkjet printing of retinal cells have shown to produce three dimensional tissue grafts that may replace defective tissues. The printed cells have been tested for survivability and regeneration properties, since it has been suggested that the printing process can cause defects. Both <b>heat</b> inkjet <b>printing</b> and piezoelectric printing have been used to create neural cells. By evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of gene therapy as well as printing, I can evaluate whether or not inkjet printing can overtake gene therapy to become a conventional treatment for glaucoma in the near future. There have not been many clinical trials done on either of these methods for glaucoma, thus it is difficult to obtain a certain answer to the question at hand. At this point advancements in the area of three-dimensional printing neural sheets may provide a more promising cure. However, more research must be done on how each of these treatments affect glaucoma in humans. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{fluorination}} technology {{developed during}} 1934 to 1959, and the fiber technology {{developed during the}} 1970 s, a new process was developed to produce graphite fluoride fibers. In the process, pitch based graphitized carbon fibers are at first intercalated and deintercalated several times by bromine and iodine, followed by several cycles of nitrogen heating and fluorination at 350 to 370 C. Electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties of this fiber depend on the fluorination process and the fluorine content of the graphite fluoride product. However, these properties are between those of graphite and those of PTFE (Teflon). Therefore, it {{is considered to be}} a semiplastic. The physical properties suggest that this new material may have many new and unexplored applications. For example, it can be a thermally conductive electrical insulator. Its coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) can be adjusted to match that of silicon, and therefore, it can be a <b>heat</b> sinking <b>printed</b> circuit board which is CTE compatible with silicon. Using these fibers in printed circuit boards may provide improved electrical performance and reliability of the electronics on the board over existing designs.

Graphite fluoride fibers with fluorine to carbon ratios of 0. 65 and 0. 68 {{were found to}} have electrical resistivity values of 10 (exp 4) and 10 (exp 11) Ohms-cm, respectively, and thermal conductivity values of 24 and 5 W/m-K, respectively. At this fluorine content range, the fibers have tensile strength of 0. 25 + or - 0. 10 GPa (36 + or - 14 ksi), Young's modulus of 170 + or - 30 GPa (25 + or - 5 Msi). The coefficient of thermal expansion value of a sample with fluorine to carbon ratio of 0. 61 was found to be 7 ppm/C. These properties change and approach the graphite value as the fluorine content approach 0. Electrically insulative graphite fluoride fiber is at least five times more thermally conductive than fiberglass. Therefore, it {{can be used as a}} <b>heat</b> sinking <b>printed</b> circuit board material for low temperature, long life power electronics in spacecraft. Also, partially fluorinated fiber with tailor-made physical properties to meet the requirements of certain engineering design can be produced. For example, a partially fluorinated fiber could have a predetermined CTE value in - 1. 5 to 7 ppm/C range and would be suitable for use in solar concentrators in solar dynamic power systems. It could also have a predetermined electrical resistivity value suitable for use as a low observable material. Experimental data indicate that slightly fluorinated graphite fibers are more durable in the atomic oxygen environment than pristine graphite. Therefore, fluorination of graphite used in the construction of spacecraft that would be exposed to the low Earth orbit atomic oxygen may protect defect sites in atomic oxygen protective coatings and therefore decrease the rate of degradation of graphite...|$|R
