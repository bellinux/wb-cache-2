The objective of this work was to investigate the structures and strategies that were employed by small firms, and which combination of these might differentiate fast-growth firms firom non-fast-growth firms, and firms <b>founded</b> <b>by</b> entrepreneurial teams from firms <b>founded</b> <b>by</b> individuals. In particular, the work sought to identify any unique coupling of structure and strategy that distinguished fast- growth firms <b>founded</b> <b>by</b> entrepreneurial teams from all other enterprises. As little work had been done on the concepts and consequences of entrepreneurial teams, this study began by examining the relationship between entrepreneurial teams, small firms, and fast-growth firms. An entrepreneurial team was defined as ?two or more individuals who have a significant financial interest and participate actively in the development of the enterprise?. Firms were then classified into fast-growth firms <b>founded</b> <b>by</b> entrepreneurial teams, fast-growth firms <b>founded</b> <b>by</b> individuals, non-fast-growth firms <b>founded</b> <b>by</b> entrepreneurial teams, and non- fast-growth firms <b>founded</b> <b>by</b> individuals, for the purpose of detailed singular and comparative investigation. A detailed exploration of the literature brought the decision to examine each of the firm classifications through structures (using the work of Bums and Stalker, 1961) and strategies (using the work of Mintzberg, 1979) ...|$|R
