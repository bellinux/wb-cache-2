40|$|During an {{automated}} manufacturing process of fibre reinforced plastics parts, material is laid up on a mould surface with Automated Fiber Placement technology. For this a sufficient tack between first ply and mould surface is important, especially for layups on vertical positioned moulds. With {{the aim of}} providing the highest possible tack, the influence of different parameters on the first ply tack was investigated. The influence of a <b>heated</b> <b>mould</b> surface on the tack was analysed by increasing the surface temperature in several steps up to 75 Â°C.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel CAD feature recognition approach for thin-walled injection <b>moulded</b> and cast <b>parts</b> in which <b>moulding</b> features are recognised from a mid-surface abstraction {{of the part}} geometry. The motivation for the research has been to develop techniques to help designers of <b>moulded</b> <b>parts</b> to incorporate manufacturing considerations into their designs early in the design process. The main contribution of the research has been {{the development of an}} attributed mid- surface adjacency graph to represent the mid-surface topology and geometry, and a feature recognition methodology for moulding features. The conclusion of the research is that the mid-surface representation provides a better basis for feature recognition for <b>moulded</b> <b>parts</b> than a B-REP solid model. A demonstrator that is able to identify ribs, buttresses, bosses, holes and wall junctions has been developed using C++, with data exchange to the CAD system implemented using ISO 10303 STEP. The demonstrator uses a commercial algorithm (I-DEAS) to create the mid-surface representation, but the feature recognition approach is generic and could be applied to any mid-surface abstraction. The software has been tested on a range of simple <b>moulded</b> <b>parts</b> and found to give good results...|$|R

40|$|Telecommunication, {{information}} and medical industries {{have a high}} growth potential. A key technology for those industries is the replication of micro-structures. Precise micro-structured parts with functional surfaces can be produced economically by injection moulding. The whole process chain (thermal mould condition, moulding, demoulding, measurement and analysis) must be analysed carefully to ensure the highest precision and reliability. To enable the precise production of the above mentioned structures fundamental studies were conducted at the IKV. The studies considered {{on the one side}} several polymers (PMMA, PC, POM) {{and on the other side}} various test structures. In addition an external inductive heating unit was analyzed and implemented into the process to heat the cavity surface efficiently. Using this technique new mould concepts could be developed with a dynamic inductive heating system to increase the moulding accuracy and reduce the formation of orientations in the <b>moulded</b> <b>part</b> drastically. The final step of the process chain comprises the measurement and analysis of the micro-structured <b>moulded</b> <b>parts.</b> To analyse the microscopic deviation between mould cavity and the surface of the <b>moulded</b> <b>part,</b> a special software-prototype was developed.

40|$|The {{injection}} moulding process {{is well known}} as an economical production process {{for the production of}} technical parts in large quantities at low cost. The smaller the parts, the shorter the specific cycle time must be in order to maintain an economical production. To increase the economical viability either the amount of cavities must be increased or the process cycle time must be reduced. When <b>moulding</b> micro <b>parts</b> or micro structured parts in conjunction with a variothermal process, special measures are essential for the implementation of this objective due to the required large heat turnover in the mould during the cycle. With conventional methods of mould temperature control only comparatively long cycle times are possible. The increase of cavities is limited because of the filigreed structures. The principle of inductive heating as a method of variothermal <b>mould</b> <b>heating</b> is one possibility to achieve shorter cycle times despite of the high cavity temperatures.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{demands for}} optical glass components, such as aspherical lenses, require flexible and economical production processes. In particular the high surface complexity {{in combination with}} high form accuracies will limit the usage of existing manufacturing technologies. High precision glass moulding technologies have great potential to fulfil the needs of an economical manufacturing process for complex shaped optical components. Due to the different material properties of glass and mould material the process chain is driven by empirical iteration cycles between mould making and moulding. Today two to three cycles are necessary to reach the final accuracies on the <b>moulded</b> <b>parts.</b> Numerical simulation can help to predict the final shape of the <b>moulded</b> <b>part</b> which leads to shortening or even elimination {{of the time and}} cost consuming iteration cycles.
