This is, under the law, infringement of copyright, and <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> so even though subconsciously accomplished.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Great Sand Sea, {{the coastal}} {{portion of the}} Libyan Desert is stony rather than sandy, but it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> arid, and {{supports}} little vegetation. Close to the coast, the ground was broken by wadis. Military vehicles could traverse the stony desert with little difficulty, although the heat, dust and wind caused their rapid deterioration. Because it was so thinly populated, bombs and shells could be used with minimal risk of civilian casualties. Winter nights could be bitterly cold, yet the days could still be uncomfortably hot. There was almost no food or water, and little shelter from the cold, the heat or the wind. The desert was, however, relatively free from disease.|$|E

5|$|I {{had settled}} {{an affair with}} five gentlemen of that country who were each of them to raise a {{regiment}} of dragoons well mounted and well armed which I knew they could easily do for the men had horses and homes of their own, and were, to say the truth most of them, the persons who some time since robbed the late Bishop of Winchester's Park, and have increased in their number ever since. They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a most loyal little town...I once saw two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile of my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> than a thousand of them and indeed I believe they have now taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.|$|E

25|$|In summary, PDiff is {{more general}} than Diff {{because it allows}} pieces (corners), and one cannot in general smooth corners, while PL <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> general that PDiff because one can linearize pieces (more precisely, one may need to break them up into smaller pieces and then linearize, which is allowed in PDiff).|$|E

25|$|The {{historical}} centre is {{a strongly}} fortified town, built by Vauban {{to defend the}} region from Austrians in the 17th century. Its streets are very steep and narrow, though picturesque. Briançon lies {{at the foot of}} the descent from the Col de Montgenèvre, giving access to Turin, so a great number of other fortifications have been constructed on the surrounding heights, especially towards the east. The Fort Janus <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> than 1,200m. above the town.|$|E
25|$|While the Toronto-Montreal rivalry {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous in sport, the rivalry with the Red Wings <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> intense. This rivalry dates to the 1920s. As of 2017, they have had twenty-three playoff meetings, five in the finals. So fierce was the rivalry that when the New York Rangers reached the finals against Detroit in 1950, but could not play in their home rink, Madison Square Garden, because the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus were in town, they {{arranged}} to play home games in Toronto, whose fans hated the Wings.|$|E

25|$|Phenobarbital {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of all types of seizures except absence seizures. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> effective at seizure control than phenytoin, however phenobarbital is not as well tolerated. Phenobarbital may provide a clinical advantage over carbamazepine for treating partial onset seizures. Carbamazepine may provide a clinical advantage over phenobarbital for generalized onset tonic-clonic seizures. Its very long active half-life means for some people doses {{do not have to be}} taken every day, particularly once the dose has been stabilized over a period of several weeks or months, and seizures are effectively controlled.|$|E
25|$|Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) uses {{a series}} of kavanot, {{directions}} of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the dialog with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably. Kabbalists ascribe a higher meaning {{to the purpose of}} prayer, which <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> than affecting the very fabric of reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. In this view, every word of every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of every word, has a precise meaning and a precise effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and repair the fabric of creation.|$|E
25|$|Since 1959, {{a second}} enigmatic group of ancient sea {{reptiles}} is known, the Hupehsuchia. Like the Ichthyopterygia, the Hupehsuchia have a pointed snout and show polydactyly, {{the possession of}} more than five fingers or toes. Their limbs more resemble those of land animals, making them appear as a transitional form between these and ichthyosaurs. Initially, this possibility was largely neglected because the Hupehsuchia have a fundamentally different form of propulsion, with an extremely stiffened trunk. The similarities were explained as a case of convergent evolution. Furthermore, the descent of the Hupehsuchia <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> obscure, meaning a possible close relationship would hardly clarify the general evolutionary position of the ichthyosaurs.|$|E

25|$|The {{condition}} that γ'A(λ) ≤ μ'A(λ) can be proven by considering a particular eigenvalue ξ of A and diagonalizing the first γ'A(ξ) columns of A {{with respect to}} the eigenvectors of ξ, described in a later section. The resulting similar matrix B is block upper triangular, with its top left block being the diagonal matrix ξI'γ'A(ξ). As a result, the characteristic polynomial of B will have a factor of (ξ−λ)γ'A(ξ). The other factors of the characteristic polynomial of B are not known, so the algebraic multiplicity of ξ as an eigenvalue of B <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> than the geometric multiplicity of ξ as an eigenvalue of A. The last element of the proof is the property that similar matrices have the same characteristic polynomial.|$|E
25|$|In City of God, Augustine {{rejected}} {{both the}} immortality {{of the human}} race proposed by pagans, and contemporary ideas of ages (such as those of certain Greeks and Egyptians) that differed from the Church's sacred writings. In The Literal Interpretation of Genesis, Augustine took the view that everything in the universe was created simultaneously by God, and not in seven calendar days like a literal interpretation of Genesis would require. He argued that the six-day structure of creation presented in the Book of Genesis represents a logical framework, rather than the passage of time in a physical way – it would bear a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, which <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>less</b> literal. One reason for this interpretation is the passage in Sirach 18:1, creavit omnia simul ("He created all things at once"), which Augustine took as proof that the days of Genesis 1 had to be taken non-literally.|$|E
