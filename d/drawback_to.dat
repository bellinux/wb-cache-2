5|$|Earlier {{methods for}} {{measuring}} convergence incorporate ratios of phenotypic and phylogenetic distance by simulating evolution with a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along a phylogeny. More recent methods also quantify {{the strength of}} convergence. One <b>drawback</b> <b>to</b> {{keep in mind is}} that these methods can confuse long-term stasis with convergence due to phenotypic similarities. Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.|$|E
5|$|A <b>drawback</b> <b>to</b> {{the device}} was found on 7 March 1948, when the firebox crown sheet of Princess Alexandra, a Coronation Pacific of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, failed while hauling a {{passenger}} train from Glasgow to London. Enquiries established that both water gauges were defective and on a journey earlier that day {{one or both of}} the fusible plugs had melted, but this had gone unnoticed by the engine crew because of the strong draught carrying the escaping steam away from them.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} first cities in the United States were chosen to host Major League Soccer teams, Seattle was {{considered}} a viable location for a professional team. In 1994, as the U.S. was preparing to host the FIFA World Cup, more than 30 cities were pursuing the rights to an MLS team, Seattle being among them. However, despite the strong soccer fan base in Seattle, {{the absence of a}} soccer-only stadium was a <b>drawback</b> <b>to</b> establishing an MLS team. Cities seeking consideration for an inaugural MLS team were also expected to secure 10,000 assurances from fans for season tickets. By the June 3, 1994 deadline for MLS team bids, Seattle organizers had secured fewer than 1,500 such assurances. These low numbers were a result of competition between the ticket campaign for the MLS expansion team and for the American Professional Soccer League (APSL) Sounders expansion team.|$|E
5|$|The native {{environment}} stayed relatively intact until settlers {{began to}} arrive in western Idaho in great numbers in the 1870s, and miners also were attracted by a gold strike at nearby Orofino, {{on the banks of}} the Clearwater River. Many of these emigrants set up dryland farms and ranches in the prairies surrounding the Potlatch River. Soil conditions generally improve as one travels southwards through the watershed, but there was a major <b>drawback</b> <b>to</b> growing crops in the southern part of the basin: the inaccessibility of water. Already scarce in the arid Potlatch River drainage, the river's water was hard to reach because of the steep canyon it passes through in most of its lower course. Farmers were restricted to growing crops that did not require irrigation, and many of the lands that did not have access to abundant-enough water were relegated to pasture or hay producing status.|$|E
5|$|As built, both ships {{also carried}} 21 /51 caliber guns arrayed ten {{to a side}} with one in the stern, {{primarily}} for defense against destroyers and torpedo boats. Many of the 5-inch guns were poor in accuracy in rough seas due to being mounted near {{the ends of the}} ship and below the main deck. The ships were not designed with anti-aircraft (AA) defense in mind, and with the development of naval aviation, this was seen as a serious <b>drawback</b> <b>to</b> the class. The New York class was the first US battleship to mount anti-aircraft guns, with two /50 caliber guns mounted on platforms on top of the boat cranes of Texas in 1916. In 1918, the secondary armament was reduced to 16 5-inch/51 caliber guns, eight to a side, as the guns near the ends of the ship were difficult to work in any kind of sea. When both ships were refitted 1925-26, AA defense was increased with eight 3-inch/50 caliber guns arrayed four to a side. Six of the 16 remaining 5-inch guns were relocated higher in the ship to new casemates on the main deck. The New York class also initially featured four torpedo tubes, 1 each on the port side bow and stern and starboard bow and stern, for the Bliss-Leavitt Mark 3 torpedo, instead of the previous two, because of advances in torpedo performance increasing the prominence of the weapon. The torpedo rooms held 12 torpedoes total, plus 12 naval defense mines. However, the torpedo tubes were removed in the 1925-26 refit.|$|E

5|$|The {{separation}} of static and dynamic data to reduce write amplification {{is not a}} simple process for the SSD controller. The process requires the SSD controller to separate the LBAs with data which is constantly changing and requiring rewriting (dynamic data) from the LBAs with data which rarely changes and does not require any rewrites (static data). If the data is mixed in the same blocks, as with almost all systems today, any rewrites will require the SSD controller to garbage collect both the dynamic data (which caused the rewrite initially) and static data (which did not require any rewrite). Any garbage collection of data that would not have otherwise required moving will increase write amplification. Therefore, separating the data will enable static data to stay at rest and if it never gets rewritten it will have the lowest possible write amplification for that data. The <b>drawback</b> <b>to</b> this process is that somehow the SSD controller must still find a way to wear level the static data because those blocks that never change will not get a chance to be written to their maximum P/E cycles.|$|E

25|$|The primary <b>drawback</b> <b>to</b> use of {{retrovirus}}es {{such as the}} Moloney retrovirus {{involves the}} requirement for cells to be actively dividing for transduction. As a result, cells such as neurons are very resistant to infection and transduction by retroviruses.|$|E
25|$|A <b>drawback</b> <b>to</b> {{the modern}} {{design of the}} Unity Temple is {{structural}} problems that have emerged over time. Through the years of its existence, the Unity Temple's concrete structure has suffered extensive water damage. Pieces of the roof fell inside the structure, and water eroded {{other parts of the}} exterior, as well.|$|E
25|$|A <b>drawback</b> <b>to</b> many {{of these}} schemes is that {{computers}} gathered through recycling drives are often shipped to developing countries where environmental standards are less strict than in North America and Europe. The Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition estimates that 80% of the post-consumer e-waste collected for recycling is shipped abroad to countries such as China and Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|One <b>drawback</b> <b>to</b> any DF system using loop {{antennae}} is {{that the}} antenna is equally sensitive on both the front and the back, so {{there is always a}} 180 degree ambiguity in the measurements - the transmitter might be {{on either side of the}} antenna. To address this, many DF systems added an additional antenna, the sense antenna (unrelated to the sense coil).|$|E
25|$|Riesling is the {{benchmark}} grape in Germany and covers the most area in German vineyards. It is an aromatic variety {{with a high}} level of acidity that can be used for dry, semi-sweet, sweet and sparkling wines. The <b>drawback</b> <b>to</b> Riesling is that it takes 130 days to ripen and, in marginal years, the Riesling crop tends to be poor.|$|E
25|$|The largest <b>drawback</b> <b>to</b> rocket flights {{is their}} very short {{duration}} (just {{a few minutes}} above the atmosphere before the rocket falls back to Earth) and their limited field of view. A rocket launched from the United States {{will not be able}} to see sources in the southern sky; a rocket launched from Australia {{will not be able to}} see sources in the northern sky.|$|E

50|$|<b>Drawbacks</b> <b>to</b> the Adventure Vision are its {{monochrome}} (red) {{screen as}} well as the mirror motor, which draws a great deal of power from the batteries. The latter problem can be avoided by the use of the built-in AC adapter port.|$|R
25|$|Seeking to {{increase}} energy production, Macri signed an investment {{deal for the}} Vaca Muerta shale deposit in Patagonia. Roughly the size of Belgium, Vaca Muerta has the second-largest reserve of shale gas in the world. To finalise the deal, the unions negotiated flexibility in labour costs (the main <b>drawback</b> <b>to</b> industrual development in the area). The Neuquén Province government pledged to improve roads and general infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 TfL {{had wanted}} to bring the Thameslink network into the London Underground network or have the route branded as a London Overground route. This would have meant the network being re-branded. The <b>drawback</b> <b>to</b> this idea was that the planned routes to Cambridge, King's Lynn, Ashford (Kent), Littlehampton and Eastbourne would have been {{abandoned}} and the improvements would have only benefited London and commuter belt towns within 15 to 20 miles of the city.|$|E
25|$|A <b>drawback</b> <b>to</b> {{the small}} size of flash drives is that they are easily misplaced, left behind, or {{otherwise}} lost. This is a particular problem if the data they contain are sensitive (see data security). As a consequence, some manufacturers have added encryption hardware to their drives—although software encryption systems which can be used in conjunction with any mass storage medium achieve the same thing. Most drives can be attached to keychains, necklaces and lanyards. The USB plug is usually fitted with a removable protective cap, or is retractable.|$|E
50|$|Mass {{production}} has many <b>drawbacks</b> <b>to</b> craft production, including that production quality can {{be lower than}} a craft-produced item.
