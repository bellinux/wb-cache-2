The highest quality cod was usually dried and salted, however, and exported to the Mediterranean in exchange for fruits not grown in American colonies.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of tariff is {{analysed}} at a broad sectoral level using a simple general equilibrium model. The sectors of the Indian economy have been classified {{on the basis of}} trade. Commodities have been identified as importables or <b>exportables</b> based on whether India is a major importer or exporter of a particular product. We have used an indirect approach to estimate the shift parameter employing time-series regression of changes in the relative price of non-tradeables to <b>exportables</b> and that of importables to <b>exportables.</b> The series were tested for stationarity and they were found to be stationary in the first differences. We used a dynamic specification to allow for lags in the adjustment of relative prices of non-tradeables to <b>exportables</b> due to changes in the relative price of importables to <b>exportables.</b> The estimate of the long-run shift parameter is found to be 0. 74 % and the estimate of the short-run shift parameter is 0. 58 %. Our results show that a 100 % rate of customs duty results in 'true' protection of importable only to the extent of 14. 9 % in the long-run and a bias against exports to the extent of 42. 5 %. ...|$|R
40|$|Whether a real {{devaluation}} ultimately {{proves to}} be expansionary or contractionary depends on whether the boost given to the <b>exportables</b> sector offsets any possible output-depressing effects that may accompany the expenditure-switching policy.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} trade on wages {{in the context of}} the specific factor model by focusing on the link between trade and the average real wage. A recent paper by Jones & Ruffin (2008) shows how one can use the specific factor model to predict how labor should fare from an improvement in the terms of trade, an increase in the price of <b>exportables</b> relative to importables. For this purpose, I use annual firm-level data on the manufacturing sector in Tanzania during the period 1992 to 1998. I find that a ceteris paribus increase in the price of <b>exportables</b> may benefit labor in the food-beverage industry but hurt labor in the textile-garment, wood-furniture and metal-machinery industries. There are industries where the specific factor model predicts that exporting would help workers, but where the Stolper-Samuelson theorem of the Hecksher-Ohlin model predicts the reverse.

40|$|The export booms in South Korea and Taiwan {{starting}} in the early 1960 s are anomalous when compared with later export booms in other, non-East Asian countries such as Chile and Turkey. First, these booms {{have taken place in}} the context of comparatively small changes in relative prices in favor of <b>exportables.</b> Second, they have been associated from the start with booms in investment. This paper offers an argument and a formal model to suggest that exports in East Asia may have been driven by an increase in the profitability of investment, with outward orientation a consequence of the investment boom rather than its instigator. In economies like South Korea and Taiwan, an increase in investment required an increase in imports of capital goods. Since savings rose alongside the desired investment, the investment boom was accompanied by a boom in both exports and imports. Moreover, this could happen with a relatively small change in the relative price of <b>exportables.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This article uses a {{simplified}} {{general equilibrium model}} to analyse the short and long run incidence of trade policy in Spain between 1978 and 1993. The incidence model is usually specified in an inter-industry framework, with increasing tariffs and either increasing or non-existent export subsidies. However, in this paper it is applied {{in a period of}} rapid liberalisation and with an intra-industry pattern of trade. The results, based on seasonal integration and cointegration techniques, show that, in the long run, the prices of <b>exportables</b> relative to non-tradables followed the fall in prices of import-competing goods. Hence, the effect of the liberalization process that took place in Spain during this period was precisely the intended one - that is to say, the enhancement of the competitiveness of the tradable sector as a whole. The slow reaction on the part of suppliers in shifting production from importables to <b>exportables</b> resulted in a certain gap between relative prices of tradables only in the short-run. In the end, the effect of trade policy was to create incentives for the reallocation of resources to the production of non-tradables.
