40|$|International audienceThe <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> {{is one of}} the {{prosodic}} parameters, {{and many}} algorithms have been developed for estimating the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> of speech signals. Most of them provide good results on good quality speech signals, but their performance degrades when dealing with noisy signals. Moreover, although some provide a probability for the voicing decision, none of them indicate how reliable the estimated <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> is. In this paper, we investigate the computation of a confidence (or reliability) measure on the estimated <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> values. A neural network based approach is proposed for computing the posterior probability that the estimated <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> is correct.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} two recursive {{schemes for}} current reference generation for shunt active filters under unknown <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency.</b> The schemes {{are based on}} the liner Kalman filter that needs the knowledge of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency.</b> In practice, the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> of the power system grid can vary. If it differs from the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> considered in the mathematical model used in the Kalman filter the estimates provided by the filter will not be accurate. This paper proposes the use of on-line identification of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> of the power system. The identified frequency is used to update de Kalman filter model...|$|R
2500|$|For the {{analysis}} of tide heights, the Fourier series approach has in practice to be made more elaborate than {{the use of a}} single frequency and its harmonics. [...] The tidal patterns are decomposed into many sinusoids having many <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequencies,</b> corresponding (as in the lunar theory) to many different combinations of the motions of the Earth, the moon, and the angles that define the shape and location of their orbits.|$|E
2500|$|For tides, then, {{harmonic}} analysis {{is not limited}} to harmonics of a single frequency. In other words, the harmonies are multiples of many <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequencies,</b> not just of the fundamental frequency of the simpler Fourier series approach. [...] Their representation as a Fourier series having only one fundamental frequency and its (integer) multiples would require many terms, and would be severely limited in the time-range for which it would be valid.|$|E

50|$|The {{richness}} {{of a sound}} or note a musical instrument produces is sometimes {{described in terms of}} a sum of a number of distinct frequencies. The lowest frequency is called the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency,</b> and the pitch it produces is used to name the note, but the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> is not always the dominant frequency. The dominant frequency is the frequency that is most heard, and it is always a multiple of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency.</b> For example, the dominant frequency for the transverse flute is double the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency.</b> Other significant frequencies are called overtones of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency,</b> which may include harmonics and partials. Harmonics are whole number multiples of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency,</b> such as ×2, ×3, ×4, etc. Partials are other overtones. There are also sometimes subharmonics at whole number divisions of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency.</b> Most instruments produce harmonic sounds, but many instruments produce partials and inharmonic tones, such as cymbals and other indefinite-pitched instruments.|$|R
25|$|Perceived pitch {{typically}} {{depends on}} the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency,</b> though the dependence could be mediated solely {{by the presence of}} harmonics corresponding to that <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency.</b> The perception of a pitch without the corresponding <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> in the physical stimulus is called the pitch of the missing fundamental. Neurons lateral to A1 in marmoset monkeys were found to be sensitive specifically to the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> of a complex tone, suggesting that pitch constancy may be enabled by such a neural mechanism.|$|R
50|$|A {{harmonic}} {{sound is}} said to have a missing fundamental, suppressed fundamental, or phantom fundamental when its overtones suggest a <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> but the sound lacks a component at the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> itself.The brain perceives the pitch of a tone not only by its <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency,</b> but also by the periodicity implied by the relationship between the higher harmonics; we may perceive the same pitch (perhaps with a different timbre) even if the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> is missing from a tone.|$|R
2500|$|Dissonance is more {{generally}} {{defined by the}} amount of beating between partials (called harmonics or overtones when occurring in harmonic timbres) ( [...] , [...] ). , [...] calls this [...] "sensory dissonance". By this definition, dissonance is dependent not only on the width of the interval between two notes' <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequencies,</b> but also on the widths of the intervals between the two notes' non-fundamental partials. Sensory dissonance (i.e., presence of beating and/or roughness in a sound) is associated with the inner ear's inability to fully resolve spectral components with excitation patterns whose critical bands overlap. If two pure sine waves, without harmonics, are played together, people tend to perceive maximum dissonance when the frequencies are within the critical band for those frequencies, which is as wide as a minor third for low frequencies and as narrow as a minor second for high frequencies (relative to the range of human hearing) [...] If harmonic tones with larger intervals are played, the perceived dissonance is due, at least in part, to the presence of intervals between the harmonics of the two notes that fall within the critical band [...]|$|E

40|$|The {{perceived}} {{duration of}} a sound is affected by its <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> and intensity: higher sounds are judged to be longer, as are sounds with greater intensity. Since increasing intensity lengthens the perceived duration of the auditory object, and increasing the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> increases the sound’s perceived loudness (up to ca. 3 kHz), frequency modulation of duration could be potentially explained by a confounding effect where {{the primary cause of}} the modulation would be variations in intensity. Here, a series of experiments are described that were designed to disentangle the contributions of <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency,</b> intensity, and duration to perceived loudness and duration. In two forced-choice tasks, participants judged duration and intensity differences between two sounds varying simultaneously in intensity, <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency,</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> gliding range, and duration. The results suggest that <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> and intensity each have an impact on duration judgments, while frequency gliding range did not influence the present results. We also demonstrate that the modulation of perceived duration by sound <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> cannot be fully explained by the confounding relationship between frequency and intensity...|$|R

30|$|Zabalza {{sees the}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> {{estimation}} as a multi-label classification problem, which {{is completely different}} from the other methods.

They collect all samples of this <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> for each <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency,</b> thus training a support vector machine classifier. The algorithm considers the classification result obtained by the classifier as the result of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> estimation. Zabalza et al. chose the piano signal for testing and the results were as expected. However, although the algorithm is novel, it needs to deal with two difficulties: First, although the algorithm uses a one-to-many classifier, the parameter space is greatly reduced, but the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> classifier is split, and it also violates the close relationship between the notes. Second, the algorithm needs to train up to dozens of classifiers, which greatly increases the amount of computation [8].|$|R

40|$|Here <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Frequency</b> is {{the main}} factor used to {{calculate}} the vibration of a vehicle when passing across a bridge. With knowledge of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency,</b> bridges can be evaluated and designed in such a manner so as to avoid the critical range of 1. 5 Hz to 4. 5 Hz, which is occupied by most vehicles. Therefore it is crucial to develop a reliable method to estimate the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> of bridges. To overcome the above issue, numerical analysis combined with a theoretical method is applied to estimate the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> of multicell box-girder bridges.

Finally, reliable expressions are proposed to predict the first <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> of this type of bridge, and the accuracy of the expressions is verified.

40|$|Tracheo-oesophageal voice {{prostheses}} {{are currently}} widely used following total laryngectomy. Data on maximum phonation time and spectrum {{have been studied}} by various Authors and are well known. On the contrary, intensity and <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> control have received little attention. Intensity and <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> {{play an important role}} in the prosodic aspects of speech. <b>Fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> variations have been studied in tone language speakers, but the ability to voluntarily change intensity and <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> remain to be fully investigated. Aim of the present study was to analyse the ability of tracheo-oesophageal voice users to change intensity and <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency.</b> A total of 12 male subjects who underwent total laryngectomy, in whom a tracheo-oesophageal prosthesis had been inserted, were considered. Maximum phonation time was calculated. Each subject was asked to utter an /a/ as loud as possible and an /a/ as soft as possible. Each subject was then asked to utter an /a/ at comfortable pitch and then at an interval of a fifth. Intensity as well as <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> variations were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Correlation between maximum phonation time and variation in intensity and in <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> as well as between the two latter variables was calculated using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Mean maximum phonation time was 8 (± 3. 8) sec. Mean energy was 50 (± 4. 8) dB SPL for soft phonation and 68 (± 4. 7) dB SPL for loud phonation. The difference observed was statistically significant (p < 0. 02). Mean <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> values were 106 (± 14) Hz and 135 (± 34) Hz at the interval of a fifth. The difference observed was statistically significant (p < 0. 02). Tracheo-oesophageal voice users were able to change intensity and <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency,</b> but their control was rather poor. Variations in intensity, as well as <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency,</b> did not show any correlation with maximum phonation time, and were not correlated with each other. In conclusion, the tracheo-oesophageal voice allows small <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> variations, but their control appears difficult.
