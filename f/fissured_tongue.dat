25|$|The {{cause is}} unknown. Geographic tongue does not usually cause any symptoms, {{and in those}} cases where there are symptoms, an oral parafunctional habit may be a {{contributory}} factor. Persons with parafunctional habits related to the tongue may show scalloping {{on the sides of}} the tongue (crenated tongue).

Sometimes geographic tongue is said to run in families, and it is reported to be associated with several different genes, though studies show family association may also be caused by similar diets. Some have reported links with various human leukocyte antigens, such as increased incidence of HLA-DR5, HLA-DRW6 and HLA-Cw6 and decreased incidence in HLA-B51.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is {{a common}} {{inflammatory}} papulosquamous disease of the skin with unknown aetiology that {{may be associated with}} the abnormal T-cell function. AIM: This study was aimed to determine the prevalence of oral mucosal lesions and their associations with severity of psoriasis in psoriatic patients attending the dermatologic clinic of Shahid Beheshti Teaching Hospital at Kashan, Iran. METHODS: In this cross-sectional descriptive analytic study, all consecutive patients with psoriasis who referred to the dermatologic clinic at the Shahid Beheshti Hospital of Kashan University of Medical Sciences in Kashan City/ Iran were enrolled. All patients were examined for the presence of oral lesions, and the clinical and epidemiological features of the disease were recorded in a questionnaire for each patient. A biopsy was taken from atypical suspected patients with oral lesions by an expert dermatologist. Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (Version 18). Descriptive statistics tests; Cross tabulation and Chi-square with Fisher's exact test were used. RESULTS: Of total 177 psoriatic patients, 62 cases (35 %) of patients were male, and 115 cases (65 %) were female. Mean age of patients was 31. 71 years. The oral lesion was seen in 83 cases (46. 9 %). <b>Fissure</b> <b>tongue</b> (28. 2 %) and geographic tongue (4. 5 %) were the most common oral lesions. The prevalence of oral lesions in patients with psoriasis significantly was associated with age, history of oral lesions, and with the onset of the oral lesions (P < 0. 05). The most common form of psoriasis was chronic plaque form (Psoriasis Vulgaris) observed in 147 cases (83. 1). The majority of patients (67. 2 %) were suffering from a mild form of the disease. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of most patients was mild. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of oral lesions such as <b>Fissure</b> <b>tongue</b> and geographic tongue is higher in psoriatic patients suggests further studies for approving the clinical importance of these apparently nonspecific lesions as possible predictors or markers of the severity of the cases suspected to Psoriasis disease...|$|R

The result is abnormal metabolim of carbohydrate protein and fat. Numerous oral soft tissue lesions {{were reported in}} diabetic patient. The goal {{of this study was}} to compare the relative frequency of oral manifestation in diabetic patients (type I) in diabetic research center with normal community of Isfahan. Methods. This experimental study was of case-control type. Popualation in which the study was conducted consisted of 96 diabetic patients and 96 healthy individuals who were relatives of diabetic patients accompanying them. Simple sampling method was used as the method of sampling Data were collected from research center by examining diabetic and control group. Data were then registeried in preformed check lists and statistically analyzed. Results.

30|$|Among the modules of {{computational}} tongue diagnosis systems, tongue body segmentation is {{a prerequisite}} for subsequent feature extraction and diagnostic analysis. Tongue body segmentation usually involves three steps: edge enhancement, contour initialization, and segmentation.

Considering the shape and gray-level characteristics of tongue contour, Zuo et al. [10, 11] proposed a polar edge detector to suppress adverse interference from the lip boundary and <b>tongue</b> <b>fissures.</b> For contour initialization, several heuristic [10], deformable model-based [35], and watershed-based [36] methods have been suggested. For segmentation, active contour models (ACM) [11, 13, 35, 37] and the gradient vector flow (GVF) snake [38] have been used for the final segmentation of the tongue body [14, 39, 40].|$|R

40|$|The {{present report}} {{describes}} the severe evolution of Kawasaki disease in a three-month-old infant. The ailment was initially atypical in its presentation, {{with the patient}} exhibiting only persistent fever in association with a progressive lethargy and maculopapular rash on the face, trunk and limbs erroneously diagnosed as roseola infantum. On the 10 th day of the condition, mainly due to the unexplained persistence of fever, the infant was admitted to a local hospital. The typical features of KD appeared only on the 14 th day of illness with the relapse of the maculopapular rash in association with non-purulent conjunctivitis; dry, reddish and <b>fissured</b> lips; <b>tongue</b> with reddish and hypertrophic papillae; erythema and edema of the palms and soles.

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic granulomatous {{disease is}} an {{extremely}} rare primary immunodeficiency syndrome that {{can be associated with}} various oral complications. This can affect high number of patients. However, data on oral complications is sparse. Here we will review the literature and describe the orofacial findings in 12 patients. Findings The age range was 5 - 31 years. Oral findings were variable, and reflected a low level of oral hygiene. They included periodontitis, rampant caries, gingivitis, aphthous-like ulcers, and geographic tongue. One patient had white patches on the buccal mucosa similar to lichen planus. Another patient had a nodular dorsum of the <b>tongue</b> associated with <b>fissured</b> and geographic <b>tongue.</b> Biopsies from the latter two lesions revealed chronic non-specific mucositis. Panoramic radiographs showed extensive periodontitis in one patient and periapical lesions in another patient. Conclusion Patients with chronic granulomatous disease may develop oral lesions reflecting susceptibility to infections and inflammation. It is also possible that social and genetic factors may influence the development of this complication. Therefore, oral hygiene must be kept at an optimum level to prevent infections that can be difficult to manage. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the accuracy of}} clinical diagnosis of Down syndrome, identify problems in reaching a diagnosis, to provide recommendations for improvement and estimate a minimum prevalence {{for all types of}} Down syndrome. DESIGN: A retrospective observational study was carried out over a five-year period. Genesis, a database located in the Department of Medical genetics, was used to identify the number of Down syndrome karyotypes including trisomy, translocation, and mosaic sample variants. Age of diagnosis was determined using date of receipt. Karyotyping requests for a clinical diagnosis of Down syndrome were also identified. Patient notes and cytogenetic laboratory reports were used to identify clinical indication for karyotyping. SETTING: Regional Genetics Centre, covering all cytogenetic analyses for referrals within the entire Northern Ireland population. RESULTS: 208 postnatal cases of Down syndrome were identified, 197 (94. 7 %) trisomy, 3 (1. 45 %) translocation, and 8 (3. 85 %) mosaic variants. 112 (54. 8 %) were male and 96 (46. 2 %) female. 268 samples were taken to confirm or exclude a clinical diagnosis of Down syndrome. 185 of these had Down syndrome, 77 were normal, and 6 had another abnormality. 90 % and 100 % of trisomy and translocation Down syndrome respectively were diagnosed on the basis of clinical features. This fell to 37. 5 % of mosaic Down syndrome patients being diagnosed clinically (p < 0. 001). Simian crease, sandal gap, epicanthic folds, hypotonia, upslanting palpebral <b>fissures,</b> and protruding <b>tongue</b> are the most frequent characteristic features seen. Similarly epicanthic folds, protruding tongue, simian crease and sandal gap, hypotonia, and upslanting palpebral fissures are also described in a significant proportion of karyotypically normal individuals, thus arousing a suspicion of Down syndrome. 89. 4 % of patients were diagnosed between day 1 and 7 of life. Of 10. 6 % patients diagnosed after day 7 of life, 7. 6 % were adults and 3 % children. The minimum prevalence was estimated at 167. 9 per 100, 000, or 1 in 595 births. CONCLUSION: In a defined population, with a prevalence of around 1 in 600 births, accurate clinical diagnosis occurred in 90 %, 100 %, and 37. 5 % of trisomy, translocation, and mosaic patients. 49. 5 % of patients had {{one or more of the}} following phenotypic findings: Simian crease, sandal gap, epicanthic folds, hypotonia, upslanting palpebral <b>fissures,</b> and protruding <b>tongue.</b> However, the same six features aroused a suspicion of Down syndrome in individuals with normal karyotyping, thus causing undue stress and worry to parents. Mosaic cases may be more common than previously recognised, and often do not have dysmorphic features. It is therefore a diagnosis that should always be considered in those who are educationally subnormal without a definitive diagnosis...|$|R

50|$|Geographic tongue, also termed benign migratory glossitis, is {{a common}} {{condition}} which usually affects the dorsal surface of the tongue. It is characterized by patches of depapillation and erythema bordered by a whitish peripheral zone. These patches give the tongue {{the appearance of a}} map, hence the name. Unlike glossitis due to nutritional deficiencies and anemia, the lesions of geographic tongue move around the tongue over time. This is because in geographic tongue, new areas of the tongue become involved with the condition whilst previously affected areas heal, giving the appearance of a moving lesion. The cause is unknown, and there is no curative treatment. Rarely are there any symptoms associated with the lesions, but occasionally a burning sensation may be present, which is exacerbated by eating hot, spicy or acidic foodstuffs. Some consider geographic tongue to be an early stage of <b>fissured</b> <b>tongue,</b> since the two conditions often occur in combination.|$|E
