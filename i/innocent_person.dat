5|$|Woo {{had over}} 90 days to shoot The Killer which was {{nearly double the}} amount of time that the average Hong Kong film was shot in the late 1980s. Woo went into filming with only a short {{treatment}} for the film and wrote the details of the script while filming. During promotion periods for the film, Woo described the film as a tribute to Martin Scorsese and French director Jean-Pierre Melville. Woo cites Melville's Le Samouraï as an influence on the story. Woo borrows plot elements for the film, including the set-up where Jef enters a nightclub and looks at the female singer. Woo also described the influence of a Japanese film, Narazumono, about a killer (Ken Takakura) who only kills delinquents. When a mob tricks him into killing an <b>innocent</b> <b>person,</b> he swears revenge but then meets a woman who has tuberculosis and wants to go home. The killer promises the woman that he will take her home after getting his revenge.|$|E

In this view, if the threatened party harms the <b>innocent</b> <b>persons,</b> NAP is not violated. Furthermore, some supporters argue that actions that minimize harm are consistent with NAP.|$|R

25|$|Another {{viewpoint}} in {{the show}} is the reference between the American and Canadian ways of handling situation involving criminal and terrorist suspects. The show contrasts American-style, results-oriented anti-terrorism efforts in handling a situation with Canadians taking a more relaxed approach to ensure an <b>innocent</b> <b>person</b> is not caught up while conducting anti-terrorist duties.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{experiments}} in social psychology was the Milgram experiment, which studied how far people would go to obey an authority figure. Following the events of The Holocaust in World War II, the experiment showed that (most) normal American citizens were capable of following orders from an authority even when they believed they were causing an <b>innocent</b> <b>person</b> to suffer.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} of innocence is only rejected when an error is very unlikely, because one doesn't want to convict an innocent defendant. Such an error is called error {{of the first}} kind (i.e., the conviction of an <b>innocent</b> <b>person),</b> and the occurrence of this error is controlled to be rare. As a consequence of this asymmetric behaviour, an error of the second kind (acquitting a person who committed the crime), is more common.|$|E
25|$|Corisco (Cristino Gomes da Silva Cleto) - {{feared for}} his cruelty. There was {{speculation}} {{that he would}} take control of the band after Angicos, where he had not been present. Seeking vengeance for Angicos, Corisco interrogated Joca Bernardes the informant who had betrayed Lampião, who shifted the blame on someone else, Domingos Ventura. Corisco then murdered this entirely <b>innocent</b> <b>person</b> and his whole family, including two women. He was killed by police in 1940.|$|E

25|$|Ajith then {{starred in}} Billa, {{a remake of}} the 1980 Rajinikanth starrer of the same name. The Vishnuvardhan directorial fetched {{critical}} praise for Ajith, becoming a trend-setter for stylish art direction and cinematography in India. Billa, yet again, featured Ajith in dual roles, one of a notorious don whilst the other played an <b>innocent</b> <b>person</b> who had to act as the don, following the former's death. After Billa, Ajith appeared in the film, Ayngaran International's production Aegan, directed by the choreographer turned director Raju Sundaram. The film, a remake of the 2004 Hindi comedy Main Hoon Na, failed at the box office.|$|E
25|$|I wish {{to express}} my heartfelt horror at the {{indiscriminate}} terrorist attacks committed against innocent people of the United States yesterday. While {{it is still not}} clear who carried out the attack, it must be stated that no right-thinking follower of Islam could possibly condone such an action. The Qur'an equates the murder of one <b>innocent</b> <b>person</b> with the murder of the whole of humanity. We pray for the families of all those who lost their lives in this unthinkable act of violence as well as all those injured; I hope to reflect the feelings of all Muslims and people around the world whose sympathies go out to the victims of this sorrowful moment.|$|E
25|$|The Dreyfus affair split France {{at the end}} of the 19th century {{over the}} guilt or innocence of a soldier, Alfred Dreyfus, who had been convicted of selling secrets to the Germans. In 1900 Clément-Bayard was one of the leading anti-Dreyfusard industrialists, along with comté Jules-Albert de Dion, who {{cancelled}} all advertising in the Drefusard newspaper Le Vélo and started a rival daily sports paper, L'Auto-Velo. The roots of both the Tour de France cycle race and L'Équipe newspaper, result from Clément's hostile anti-Dreyfusard stance. The Dreyfus affair was eventually concluded with the official exoneration of Dreyfus (as an <b>innocent</b> <b>person</b> who had been framed). With the end of official inquiries it may be said that Clément-Bayard and de Dion had been wrong for a decade.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{gameplay}} {{and game}} mechanics {{fall into the}} subgenre of Grand Theft Auto clones. As such, Montana can commandeer vehicles (cars and boats), can move around the map on foot, can interact with civilians and NPCs both hostile and non-hostile, can engage in primary and sub-missions, and can wield a variety of weaponry; pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, assault rifles, a sniper rifle, a rocket launcher, a chainsaw, and various melee weapons, such as pipes and machetes. In a departure from most Grand Theft Auto-style games, Montana cannot kill innocent people. If the player tries to shoot a non-aggressive target, Montana will refuse; if the player tries to hit an <b>innocent</b> <b>person</b> with a car, they will only be injured. However, as the game progresses, the player acquires access to some of Montana's employees; a driver, a boat pilot, a weapons dealer, an enforcer and an assassin. When these employees have been unlocked, the player can switch control from Montana {{to any one of}} them (except the weapons dealer), and when playing as the enforcer or the assassin, the player can kill innocent people.|$|E
500|$|According to Hitchcock, {{a series}} of shots with Arbogast going up the stairs in the Bates house before he is stabbed were helmed by {{assistant}} director Hilton A. Green, working with storyboard artist Saul Bass' drawings only while Hitchcock was incapacitated with the common cold. However, upon viewing the dailies of the shots, Hitchcock was forced to scrap them. He claimed they were [...] "no good" [...] {{because they did not}} portray [...] "an <b>innocent</b> <b>person</b> but a sinister man who was going up those stairs". Hitchcock later re-shot the scene, though a little of the cut footage made its way into the film. Filming the murder of Arbogast proved problematic owing to the overhead camera angle necessary to hide the film's twist. A camera track constructed on pulleys alongside the stairway together with a chairlike device had to be constructed and thoroughly tested over a period of weeks.|$|E
500|$|To {{carry the}} {{remainder}} of the third season, Dexters writers introduced Miguel as a new character so that his relationship with Dexter could serve as a [...] "central arc". In order to allow them to explore Dexter's psychological and emotional reactions, the writers revealed Dexter's girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz) to be pregnant. They also had Dexter kill an <b>innocent</b> <b>person</b> to develop the ongoing theme of rebellion despite initially rejecting the idea of Dexter killing [...] "somebody who doesn't deserve it". Filming of the episode began in early June in Los Angeles, California at Sunset Gower Studios, though a small crew flew to Miami, Florida, where the show is set, to film short pieces of Dexter, which were integrated into [...] "Our Father" [...] and other episodes. The episode brought in 1.22 million viewers, an improvement from second season's premiere and finale, and attracted mixed reviews from critics.|$|E

50|$|It is {{the duty}} of the Prosecution Service to attend to cases as quickly as possible. The Prosecution Service must make sure that {{offenders}} are called to account in accordance with the law, but must also ensure that <b>innocent</b> <b>persons</b> are not prosecuted.|$|R
50|$|During {{his term}} {{as a federal}} minister, Burney visited 25 prisons and mental asylums {{throughout}} Pakistan, resulting in the release of several hundred <b>innocent</b> <b>persons</b> including {{children as young as}} seven.

500|$|Several {{months after}} the deaths of his {{colleague}} Sgt. James Doakes and his Narcotics Anonymous sponsor Lila Tournay (Jaime Murray), Dexter's life has returned to normal. He looks up a drug dealer, Fred [...] "Freebo" [...] Bowman (Mike Erwin), whom he believes to have killed two female college students. Pretending to want to buy heroin, Dexter visits Freebo's house, where he sees Freebo's girlfriend Teegan Campbell (Jelly Howie). He returns to the house at night and finds Freebo fighting with another man (Nick Hermz). When the man attacks Dexter, Dexter stabs and kills him in self-defense. Dexter flees, shocked about breaking his father Harry's [...] "code" [...] and killing an <b>innocent</b> <b>person.</b> He is called to the scene the following day and discovers {{that the man was}} Oscar Prado, the brother of well-known assistant district attorney Miguel Prado. Miguel seeks an explanation and consolation from Dexter, and invites him to Oscar's wake. Dexter attends, leaving Debra alone on their dead father's birthday. He begins to question Harry's code and whether his loyalty is necessary.|$|E
500|$|New York Times {{reporter}} Linda Greenhouse {{described the}} initial verdict as [...] "an anomaly, an extreme misuse of Government power {{in which an}} <b>innocent</b> <b>person</b> was led to commit a manufactured crime" [...] and thus not likely to signal a shift back in favor of defendants after a period that had seen a {{move away from the}} liberalism of the Warren and Burger Courts towards a more law-and-order–oriented Court. Editorialists at newspapers around the country – the Times, the Chicago Tribune, and the Washington Post – praised the court's decision, as did Jacobson's hometown paper, the Omaha World-Herald. Columnists {{on both sides of the}} political spectrum, from Clarence Page to William Safire joined in celebrating his turn of fate and criticizing the excessive zeal of the postal inspectors. Civil liberties advocates savored what they felt was an overdue triumph against the overreach of law enforcement during the preceding decade. [...] "... (W)hen the State gets behind a moral panic, no one is safe," [...] wrote Bob Chatelle of the political issues committee of the American Writers' Union, pointing to other zealous prosecutions of people with no demonstrable interest in child pornography who had nevertheless fallen afoul of newer laws by taking or possessing pictures of naked children with no apparent sexual content.|$|E
500|$|Dexters writing staff began {{meeting in}} March 2008 to {{brainstorm}} {{ideas for the}} third season's storylines. Writer Clyde Phillips said that, when the writers decided to open season 3 with the revelation of Rita's pregnancy, [...] "we were thinking about how it would affect Dexter psychologically and emotionally to create a life when he {{has spent most of}} his adult life taking lives." [...] They chose to introduce Miguel as a new character with the intention for his and Dexter's relationship to be [...] "the central arc of the season", according to Hall. Smits was the only actor who was considered for the role of Miguel. Smits was not initially interested in joining the cast, but after Phillips explained Miguel's dark side to him, Smits accepted the job offer because it was an opportunity to play a character dissimilar to any he had played before. He said, [...] "They promised upfront that this was really going to challenge me, that it would be stuff that I haven't done before, and they've really given me a shot. They've delivered the goods." [...] In regard to Dexter's abandonment of Harry's Code, Hall said that [...] "That need to rebel is a real engine for what unfolds this season." [...] Smits was hired to appear in ten of the season's twelve episodes. When asked at the beginning of the second season whether there was any possibility of Dexter killing an <b>innocent</b> <b>person,</b> show runner Daniel Cerone said that by not doing so, they were [...] "protecting the character". He thought that it was [...] "very important for the show that he does kill people who deserve it". Phillips said that [...] "We don't want him knowingly killing somebody who doesn't deserve it out of impulse or something, but we have explored the notion of his having killed someone without properly vetting that person and perhaps making a mistake." ...|$|E
50|$|Following {{the fall}} of the {{communist}} regime in Czechoslovakia, the legacy of Maruška Kudeříková was questioned in a documentary made by Czech Television.
