5|$|The Chinese dragon, {{which has}} symbolised unity of Chinese people {{since it was}} the first {{national}} emblem of unified China, <b>is</b> <b>painted</b> in multicolour on Block 15's south and north facing walls because it was the 500th public housing building in Hong Kong. Block 15's distinctive imagery made it a recognisable symbol of Lam Tin and the district's unity. After demolition and reconstruction, Block 15 became part of Ping Tin Estate.|$|E

While the male neck is sometimes adorned with a jewelled hooded serpent, the female neck has a blue lotus matching it.|$|E
5|$|A 1663 will by Richard Harvey of Exeter {{established}} Almshouses {{which became}} Harvey's Hospital. These were rebuilt in 1870 largely of stone from previous building. In 1685 Chard {{was one of}} the towns in which Judge Jeffreys held some of the Bloody Assizes after the failure of the Monmouth Rebellion in which 160 men from Chard joined the forces of the Duke of Monmouth. The subsequent hangings took place on Snowden Hill {{to the west of the}} town. As elsewhere in this area, the 'finger-post' road-sign at this spot <b>is</b> <b>painted</b> red and is known as 'Red Post' to commemorate the executions.|$|E
5|$|Al-Aqsa's dome {{is one of}} the few domes to be {{built in}} front of the mihrab during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods, the others being the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus (715) and the Great Mosque of Sousse (850). The {{interior}} of the dome <b>is</b> <b>painted</b> with 14th-century-era decorations. During the 1969 burning, the paintings were assumed to be irreparably lost, but were completely reconstructed using the trateggio technique, a method that uses fine vertical lines to distinguish reconstructed areas from original ones.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> {{dark green}} lined out with red between two cream lines. The buffer beams <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> red. In {{the days of}} the Great Southern Railways the locomotives <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in a plain grey livery, the buffer beams being red.|$|R
50|$|The class have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> in {{a variety}} of {{different}} liveries during their careers, reflecting their mixed-traffic role. For the initial trials nos. 337 and 338 <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in red oxide, and after acceptance they <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in dove grey, lined with black and white for the official photographs (see above). Thereafter members of the class <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> plain black by the LB&SCR. Under Southern Railway ownership three examples <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in lined umber, and others in passenger green and lined black. During the Second World War they <b>were</b> either <b>painted</b> in unlined dark green or black. Under British Railways the usual livery was lined black.|$|R
50|$|Currently, a {{total of}} three Cathay Pacific {{aircraft}} <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> in the Oneworld livery to commemorate the alliance's 10th anniversary. On 12 March 2009, Cathay Pacific's first Oneworld aircraft, an Airbus A340-300 (B-HXG), <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> in the new, standard Oneworld livery. An additional aircraft, an Airbus A330-300 (B-HLU), has also <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> in the Oneworld livery while a brand-new Boeing 777-300ER (B-KPL) <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> and delivered on 17 October 2009.|$|R
5|$|As sweet {{a little}} nook as ever Ulysses mooned away a day in, during his memorable voyage homeward. Though merely a small bay, {{about a mile}} in breadth, and curving inland for {{a mile and a}} half, it is quite {{sheltered}} from all winds save the east, being flanked to the south and west by Haskeval and Hondeval, and guarded on the northern side by a low range of heathery slopes. In this sunny time, the sheep are bleating from the shores, the yacht lies double, yacht and shadow, and the bay <b>is</b> <b>painted</b> richly with the clear reflection of the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus and Tiberius {{are often}} contrasted by ancient historians, poets who wrote using themes found in drama, with Germanicus playing the tragic hero and Tiberius the tyrant. The {{endurance}} of the Principate is challenged in these narratives, by the emperor's jealous trepidation toward competent commanders such as Germanicus. Attention is paid particularly to their leadership styles, i.e., {{in their relationship}} with the masses. Germanicus <b>is</b> <b>painted</b> as a competent leader able to handle the masses whereas Tiberius is indecisive and envious.|$|E
5|$|His {{eyes are}} open, {{and his skin}} is unblemished. The cross <b>is</b> <b>painted</b> with deep blue paint, perhaps evoking an eternal or {{timeless}} sky. This evocation, not present in the main crucified figure, {{was known as the}} Christus triumphans ("Triumphant Christ"), and for contemporary– especially Franciscan– taste lacked verisimilitude, as it bore little relation to the actual suffering likely endured during a crucifixion, and overly distanced the divine from the human aspect of Christ. From about 1240, painters favoured the Christus patiens ("Suffering Christ") style: a saviour who shared the burden and pain of humanity. The Santa Croce Crucifix is one of the earliest and best known examples of the type.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{its history}} the “P” has <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> {{numerous}} times as well. In {{a response to}} the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the campus painted the concrete letter with the stars and stripes of the American flag. For bicentennial, it <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> red, white, and blue. It has <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> with hearts for Valentine's Day and red and green for Christmas. Zebra stripes have even <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> across its face.|$|R
50|$|The current roster {{is made up}} {{completely}} {{of second}} generation EMD Switcher Units. Majority of the switchers <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> blue but numerous units <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> different colors including #3 and #17 <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> green, while #1 and #33 have a new yellow and red scheme.|$|R
50|$|Three {{locomotives}} (803, 813, 814) <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in {{a special}} color scheme and later <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> in normal livery.|$|R
5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{is a form}} {{of military}} deception in which a ship <b>is</b> <b>painted</b> in one or more colors in order to obscure or confuse an enemy's visual observation. Several types of marine camouflage have been used or prototyped: blending or crypsis, in which a paint scheme attempts to hide a ship from view; deception, in which a ship is made to look smaller or, as with the Q-ships, to mimic merchantmen; and dazzle, a chaotic paint scheme which tries to confuse any estimate of distance, direction, or heading. Counterillumination, to hide a darkened ship against the slightly brighter night sky, was trialled by the Royal Canadian Navy in diffused lighting camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Alexander at Issus <b>is</b> <b>painted</b> on a limewood panel {{measuring}} , and {{portrays the}} moment of Alexander the Great's victory. The vertical format was dictated by the space available in the room for which the painting was commissioned – each in William's set of eight was made {{to be the same}} size. At an unknown date, the panel was cut down on all sides, particularly at the top, so the sky was originally larger and the moon further from the corner of the scene. The scene is approached from an impossible viewpoint – at first only feet from the fray, the perspective gradually ascends to encompass the seas and continents in the background and eventually the curvature of the Earth itself.|$|E
5|$|The Kuching Orangutan Murals {{are vital}} {{images of a}} {{wheelbarrow}} filled with eight young orangutans and another baby orangutan swinging from a pipe. It was painted by Ernest Zacharevic along Power Street in the city on 27 April 2014. This latest mural <b>is</b> <b>painted</b> in Zacharevic's usual interactive style, with an actual wheelbarrow sliced into half and secured to the wall to enable the public to take selfies while holding onto the handle. On the other hand, the baby orangutan was painted over a nail on the wall, where people can 'place' items in its hand.|$|E
50|$|All Japanese {{police force}} {{vehicles}} <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> and marked {{in the same}} ways. Japanese police vehicles <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> black and white with the upper parts of the vehicle painted white. However, motorcycles are usually all white and riot control and rescue vehicles <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> a steel blue.|$|R
25|$|With the Routemaster's longevity, {{examples}} <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> {{to celebrate}} both the Queen's Silver and Golden Jubilees. In 1977, 25 Routemasters <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> silver and temporarily renumbered SRM1 to SRM25 {{to celebrate the}} Silver Jubilee and, in 2002, 50 buses <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> gold including three RMs and 12 RMLs.|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] it will {{perhaps be}} replied, [...] "have, then, ships never <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> {{perfectly}} yet, {{even by the}} men who have devoted most attention to them?" [...] Assuredly not. A ship never yet has <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> at all, in any other sense than men have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> in [...] "Landscapes with figures." [...] Things have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> which have a general effect of ships, just as things have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> which have a general effect of shepherds or banditti; but the best average ship-painting no more reaches the truth of ships than the equestrian troops in one of Van der Meulen's battle-pieces express the higher truths of humanity.|$|R
