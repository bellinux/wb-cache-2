5|$|Hergé {{retained}} the anti-German sentiment {{that he had}} first considered for King Ottokar's Sceptre through {{the inclusion of a}} German villain, Dr. Müller, who would go on to become a recurring character in the series. He based the character largely on Georg Bell, a Scottish forger who had been a vocal supporter of the Nazi regime, and who he <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> from an article in anti-conformist Belgian magazine La Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell). Rather than Germans, Müller's henchmen were given the Russian names Ivan and Wronzoff, although the latter would be renamed Puschov by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper for the English translation.|$|E

5|$|Before other British {{outposts}} <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> Pontiac's siege at Detroit, Native Americans captured five small forts in {{a series}} of attacks between May 16 and June 2. The first to be taken was Fort Sandusky, a small blockhouse on the shore of Lake Erie. It had been built in 1761 by order of General Amherst, despite the objections of local Wyandots, who in 1762 warned the commander that they would soon burn it down. On May 16, 1763, a group of Wyandots gained entry under the pretense of holding a council, the same stratagem that had failed in Detroit nine days earlier. They seized the commander and killed the other 15 soldiers, as well as British traders at the fort. These were among the first of about 100 traders who were killed {{in the early stages of}} the war. The dead were ritually scalped and the fort—as the Wyandots had warned a year earlier—was burned to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Despite Malawi's limited {{health and}} {{educational}} infrastructure, knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS is high among many {{people living in}} both urban and rural Malawi. According to a 2004 study by Barden-O'Fallon et al. involving 100 households, women in Malawi {{are most likely to}} learn about HIV/AIDS through radio and television, health workers at local clinics, and female members of their social networks. Men are also likely to access information about HIV/AIDS through radio and television; however, unlike women, they are not likely to gain information about HIV/AIDS from their male friends. When 57 Malawian men were interviewed in 2003, 100% of them said they had heard about the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the radio, and 84.2% of them said they <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> HIV/AIDS during their visits to local health facilities; this supports the fact that many people in Malawi have access to information about the epidemic, both through the radio and other sources.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{incorporated}} several characters {{into the}} story who had previously been introduced in earlier Adventures; this included Dr. Müller, a German villain who had previously appeared in The Black Island, and the Portuguese merchant Oliviera da Figueira, who had first appeared in Cigars of the Pharaoh. Hergé also included {{a reference to the}} recurring character Bianca Castafiore, whose singing appears on the radio in one scene. He also introduced a number of new characters in the story; this included the Emir Ben Kalish Ezab, a character who was based largely on Ibn Saud, the king of Saudi Arabia, whom Hergé <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> from a 1939 book by Anton Zischke. It has also been suggested that the character was partly inspired by the deceased Iraqi leader, Faisal I. The character of the Emir's son, Prince Abdullah, was inspired by the King of Iraq, Faisal II, who was appointed monarch in 1939 aged four, although in creating this character Hergé had also been influenced by an obnoxious child character that appears in the work of O. Henry.|$|E

5|$|Hergé {{initially}} titled {{this new}} work Tintin et les Faussaires ("Tintin and the Forgers") before changing this working title to Tintin et L'Alph-Art. The story's main antagonist, Endaddine Akass, {{was based on}} a real-life art forger, Fernand Legros, whom Hergé <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> through reading a biography of him. The Akass character was also influenced by an article about the Indian guru Rajneesh which Hergé had read in a December 1982 edition of the Paris Match. In Hergé's notes, he included the idea of revealing that Akass was Tintin's nemesis, Rastapopoulos, in disguise, with Farr believing that this plot twist would have been revealed had Hergé completed the story. Conversely, Harry Thompson suggested that Hergé had dropped Rastapopolous from the story in 1980. Hergé's notes reveal that he considered various different names for the artist character, including Ramon Hasj and Ramo Nasj, before settling on Ramo Nash. Similarly, he had initially debated whether Nash should be a painter or a sculptor, before deciding on the latter.|$|E
5|$|The Australians <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> Katagiri's {{plans and}} as a result the 9th Division commander, Wootten, decided to put off his own {{offensive}} plans while the Japanese attack was dealt with. It came {{in the early hours of}} 17 October, and over the course of the following week heavy fighting ensued around Katika and Jivevaneng. Forewarned, the Australians were able to check these attacks with assistance from American support units, and by the time that the Japanese called off their offensive on 25 October, the Japanese 20th Division had suffered 352 men killed and 564 wounded, while the Australians had suffered 228 casualties. It was during the early stages of this fighting that an American soldier, Private Nathan Van Noy, from the 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, performed the deeds that resulted in him being posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|The raid was {{preceded by}} the escape of seven POWs on 30 August 1944. The organisers of the escape were Private Ralph Frederick Churches, an Australian Army {{infantry}} soldier of the 2/48th Battalion {{who had been on}} temporary duty with Headquarters ANZAC Corps when he was captured during the Allied withdrawal from Greece in April–May 1941, and Driver Leslie Arthur Laws, a British Army soldier of the 127th (Dorset) Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Royal Engineers. By August 1944, Churches had already attempted to escape on two occasions and <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> the surroundings from those experiences. He realised that he had to escape while the prisoners were in an environment hostile to the Germans. Churches had learned to speak passable German during his captivity, and had been the camp leader of the work camp for eighteen months when he resigned the role so he could be involved in the escape.|$|E
