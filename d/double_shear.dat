40|$|AbstractSlow flow of {{granular}} materials, {{which typically}} occurs during the emptying of industrial storage hoppers and bins, has great industrial relevance. In the present study, we have employed our newly developed dilatant <b>double</b> <b>shearing</b> model [H. Zhu, M. M. Mehrabadi, M. Massoudi, Incorporating {{the effects of}} fabric in the dilatant <b>double</b> <b>shearing</b> model for granular materials, Int. J. Plast. 22 (2006) 628 â€“ 653] to study the slow flow of a frictional, dense granular material. Although most models pertain only to the fully developed granular flow, {{the application of the}} dilatant <b>double</b> <b>shearing</b> model is shown to be valid from the onset of granular flow to the fully developed granular flow. In this paper, we use the finite element program ABAQUS/Explicit to numerically simulate the granular Couette flow and the frictional granular flow in a silo. For the granular Couette flow, the relative density variation and the velocity profile obtained by using the dilatant <b>double</b> <b>shearing</b> model are in good quantitative agreement with those obtained from a DEM simulation. For the frictional flow in a silo, the major principal stress directions are obtained at various time steps after the onset of silo discharge. We find that, in the hopper zone, the arching of the granular material between the sloping hopper walls is clearly demonstrated by the change in direction of the major principal stress. We also compare the pressure distribution along the wall before and after the onset of silo discharge. The numerical results show that the dilatant <b>double</b> <b>shearing</b> model is capable of capturing the essential features of the frictional granular flow...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} elasto-plastic {{model for}} the deformation and flow of granular materials which generalises the plastic potential model and contains an additional term analogous to that appearing in the <b>double</b> <b>shearing</b> model is presented. It is shown that for planar flows the resulting system of first order partial differential equations is hyperbolic. This is in distinct contrast to the non-associated plastic potential model rule and the <b>double</b> <b>shearing</b> model, both of which fail to be hyperbolic. The ill-posedness of the planar <b>double</b> <b>shearing</b> model {{is due to the}} presence of the rotation-rate of the principal axes of stress. The ill-posedness of the non-associated plastic potential model is due to distinct quasi-static spatial stress and velocity characteristics. The present model attains well-posedness by replacing the planar rotation-rate of the principal stress axes by the vector intrinsic spin of a Cosserat continuum and using it to ensure identical spatial stress and velocity characteristics. Flows in which the intrinsic spin vector is constant in both space and time correspond to flows in an ordinary continuum. The model governing such flows is embedded into a Cosserat model {{in such a way that}} the characteristic structure is preserved...|$|R

The bonded part of the new specimen is identical to a conventional <b>double</b> lap <b>shear</b> specimen, but the specimen is end-loaded in compression instead of in tension.

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, {{there has been a}} shift to using more {{lightweight}} materials for the potential of fuel consumption reduction. In the Aerospace Industry, conventional metal structures are being replaced by advanced composite structures. The major advantage of an advanced composite structure is the huge {{reduction in the number of}} parts and joints required. Also composite materials provide better resistance to creep, corrosion, and fatigue. However, one cannot eliminate all the joints and attachments in an aircraftâ€™s structure. Eliminating structural joints is impractical in present-day aircraft because of the requirements for inspection, manufacturing breaks, assembly and equipment access, and replacement of damaged structures. Currently, composite joints are overdesigned which leads to weight penalties. Understanding how to optimize the ultimate bearing strength of a composite joint by altering the cure cycle might be beneficial to the composite joint design process. This study investigates, through numerical and experimental analysis, the mechanical behavior of <b>double</b> <b>shear</b> joints. The first task is to test Aluminum <b>double</b> <b>shear</b> joint specimens inside the <b>double</b> <b>shear</b> joint fixture at a loading rate of 0. 05 in. /min. (quasi-static). The second task is to numerically model and validate the aluminum <b>double</b> <b>shear</b> joint specimen. The third task is to test the Unidirectional MTM 49 carbon fiber pre-preg <b>double</b> <b>shear</b> composite joint specimens with two different cure cycles and five different loading rates (0. 05 in. /min., 0. 1 in. /min., 1 in. /min., 2 in. /min. and 6 in. /min.). The <b>double</b> <b>shear</b> composite joint specimens are made, using a heat press, with a quasi-isotropic laminate orientation of [0 0 + 45 - 45 + 45 - 45 90 90]s. The first cure cycle used is called the alternate cure cycle, which is Cytecâ€™s MTM 49 Unidirectional Carbon Fiber pre-preg material cure cycle, and the second cure cycle used is called the datasheet cure cycle, which is Umeco 2 Ì† 7 s MTM 49 Unidirectional Carbon Fiber pre-preg material cure cycle. The recommended datasheet cure cycle and an alternate cure cycle are both compared to see how they affect the mechanical characteristics of the matrix along with the bearing stress. The fourth task is to adjust the Aluminum <b>double</b> <b>shear</b> joint numerical model for the <b>double</b> <b>shear</b> composite joint specimen. The numerical results for both the Aluminum and the composite specimens are in agreement with the experimental results.

Â A simple two dimensional creasing simulation was performed. In this model, paperboard was modeled as a combination of an anisotropic elastic-plastic continuum model with isotropic hardening and a softening cohesive interface model. The paperboard was composed of four plies with uniform material parameters. Creasing simulations were done on both machine direction (MD) and cross machine direction (CD) samples to two crease depths 0. 0 mm and 0. 2 mm, respectively. The simulation results showed good agreement with experimental results. Â The out-of-plane shear properties are dominating factors for creasing and folding. Therefore, a test method to determine shear properties was proposed. This {{part of the work}} is based on the most recently proposed test method, the laminated <b>double</b> notch <b>shear</b> test. To improve the technique, double notches with declined slopes, called tilted <b>double</b> notch <b>shear</b> test, were used instead of uniform depth double notches.
