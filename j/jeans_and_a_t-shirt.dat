5|$|Naughty Dog based Drake's {{appearance}} and personality on daredevil Johnny Knoxville, actor Harrison Ford, and {{the heroes of}} pulp magazines, novels and films. To make him relatable, the character was dressed in <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>T-shirt,</b> and given an everyman persona; he is strong-willed, and often jokes and quips. The designers focused on giving him realistic reactions to his environment; for example, he stumbles while running, barely clears objects during leaps, and recognizes the absurdity of the situations in which he finds himself.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on August 6, 7 and 8, 1998, and was {{directed}} by Nigel Dick. After being chosen, Dick received criticism from his colleagues about wanting to work with Spears. He responded saying, [...] "It's a great song. I don't know anything about Britney. I never watched The Mickey Mouse Club. She seems like a great kid and she's very enthusiastic, but I just love the song. It's just a great song". The video's original setup was in high contrast to what eventually became the final product. The plan {{was to have the}} video in a cartoon-like environment, in a likely attempt to attract the audience of younger children. Spears was unhappy with this, and argued that she wanted her video to reflect the lives of her fans and wanted to set the video in a school. Spears pitched this idea to Dick, and further explained she wanted the video to have dance scenes. The original setting was scrapped and replaced with Spears's concept. Dick's original idea for the wardrobe was <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>T-shirt,</b> but during the wardrobe fitting Spears decided to change it for a schoolgirl outfit. Dick said that [...] "Every piece of wardrobe in the video came from Kmart, and I was told at the time not one piece of clothing in the video cost more than $17. On that level, it's real. That probably, in retrospect, is a part of its charm." [...] The knotted shirt design was Spears's idea, she recollects saying, [...] "The outfits looked kind of dorky, so I was like, 'Let's tie up our shirts and be cute'". About the experience of shooting her first music video, Spears said, [...] "It was a wonderful experience. All these people there, working for you. I had my own trailer. It was an amazing experience". The music video was shot at Venice High School, the same school used to film the movie Grease. The video premiered on MTV and other video stations in November 1998.|$|E

2500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Good for You" [...] {{was directed by}} Sophie Muller. In the video, Gomez wanted to represent her journey to womanhood and to promote female empowerment — which she felt strongly about and wanted to depict in a raw and vulnerable way. With the clip, she wanted to prove that young women should not be self-conscious of their sex appeal or be obliged to wear lingerie to feel attractive. [...] "I feel like people here, especially guys are like, 'Ah, lingerie and sexy.' I think being sexy {{as a young woman}} or girl, is not caring what other people think, wearing like casual things, feeling sexy". The singer felt it was important to collaborate with a female director as a means of female empowerment and wanted the visual to be raw and vulnerable. She was also drawn to jeans and T-shirt attire and believed it would prove to women that they need not dress in lingerie to feel attractive. She chose the video to be specifically about her, absent of a love interest or men, to reflect the song's meaning of female self-empowerment. She later said Muller [...] "created a beautiful and intimate visual representation" [...] of [...] "Good for You". Speaking of the music video's theme, Gomez stated, [...] "It's very <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>T-shirt,</b> moments where a woman is deep in thought, or in a moment where she's in this crazy little rage. It just captures real things that women do. There {{are a lot of things}} that women do that are sexy that aren't just the typical, cheap way of being sexy." ...|$|E

When I have the opportunity to play music, I don’t necessarily want to be just in <b>a</b> pair of <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> black <b>t-shirt...</b> I think t of it more as a performance, you know? You want to get up there and do this performance and you want to dress the part too; wear something unique to make yourself stand out, and when Marla came to me with the idea of beginning the line, she really understood that.You like to stand out and do unique things and make something that’s completely your own. But really, the key for us is having the music being so connected to the jewelry because that’s our niche; that’s where we fit in, why we’re different.Not many people are necessarily doing this. A well known singer and performer may have a designer line, but it’s usually not tied into their music at all. It’s tied into their name but not necessarily to what they’re about and who they are and what their music is about. So really fusing those and keeping those so tight; that’s the foundation of the line.When we release a new piece, we have a piece of unreleased music that goes along with it too. I think that’s really where we’re having the most fun- thinking about how the piece ties into the music. That, and working with the community and people who back the line.It’s more than the fan base. I mean, a lot of people we’ve gotten to know personally, <b>and</b> they’ve become <b>a</b> part of our lives. It’s kind of tying everybody in closer and closer and bringing it together, and I think having a charity at the root of it- It not only makes us feel good to know that we’re doing something, but it’s kind of nice knowing that there’s this real passion behind the line. It’s not all commerce- there’s really some good being done.” ...|$|R
