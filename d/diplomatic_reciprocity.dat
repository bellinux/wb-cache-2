5000|$|An Ambassador was {{regarded}} as the personal representative of his sovereign {{as well as his}} government. [...] Only major monarchies would exchange Ambassadors with each other, while smaller monarchies and republics only sent Ministers. Because of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>reciprocity,</b> Great Powers would only send a Minister to a smaller monarchy or a republic. For example, in the waning years of the Second French Empire, the United Kingdom sent an Ambassador to Paris, while Sweden-Norway and the United States sent Ministers.|$|E
50|$|Through the 19th {{century and}} {{the early years of}} the 20th century, most {{diplomatic}} missions were legations. An ambassador was considered the personal representative of his monarch, so only a major power that was a monarchy would send an ambassador and establish an embassy. A republic or a smaller monarchy would only send a Minister and establish a legation. <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>reciprocity</b> meant that even a major monarchy would only establish a legation in a republic or a smaller monarchy. For example, in the waning years of the Second French Empire, the North German Confederation had an embassy in Paris, while Bavaria and the United States had legations.|$|E
5000|$|Between two {{different}} States in the United States, enforcement is generally required under the [...] "Full Faith and Credit Clause" [...] (Article IV, Section 1) of the U.S. Constitution, which compels a State to give another State's Judgment an effect {{as if it}} were local. This usually requires some sort of an abbreviated application on notice, or docketing. Between one State in the United States, and a foreign country, Canada, for example, the prevailing concept is comity. The Court in the United States, in most cases, will unilaterally enforce the foreign judgment, without proof of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>reciprocity,</b> either under judge-made law or under specific statutes.|$|E
50|$|Outside the European context, emperor was the {{translation}} given to holders of titles who were accorded the same precedence as European emperors in <b>diplomatic</b> terms. In <b>reciprocity,</b> these rulers might accredit equal titles {{in their native}} languages to their European peers. Through centuries of international convention, this has become the dominant rule to identifying an emperor in the modern era.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 In {{the year}} of 1005 the Liao and the Song {{concluded}} the Shanyuan treaty and it initiated the peace between these two states, which was conditioned to exchange biannual envoy missions: on New Year's day and imperial birthdays. After the Shanyuan Treaty was formalized, diplomatic relations between the Song and Liao courts brought them to an equal status, and the stage for their competition and diplomacy moved to issues regarding tributary protocol and diplomatic gifts. Song and Liao rivalry required not only Song and Liao but also Goryeo and Xi Xia to make some adjustments on their diplomatic politics and gradually all four courts had {{a certain level of}} flexibility in managing their relationship. Diplomatic gifts of these states provide a good way to examine dynamics among these four states in East Asia during eleventh century. To secure their political position and economic benefits, all four states actively managed the guest ritual and diplomatic gifts. Song and Liao devised several ways to maintain mutual respect and coined a neutral name for their "tribute" to each other as "ritual gifts. " The Goryeo, caught between the Liao and the Song, tried to prepare similar but appealing diplomatic gifts to both courts, and the Xi Xia utilized its strategic position as a strongman in the trade to Central Asia to receive commercial benefit under the name of Song "return gifts. " Through these dynamics, whether an item was named "ritual gift" or "tribute," the common element of diplomatic gifts was self-interest through <b>reciprocity.</b> Throughout frequent <b>diplomatic</b> contacts, Song agencies responsible for diplomacy were institutionalized and operated efficiently with various specialized departments. When they prepared and exchanged diplomatic gifts, the kinds and quantity of material objects were carefully managed. Although basic principle of gift exchange was <b>reciprocity,</b> <b>diplomatic</b> gifts displayed multifaceted characteristics. Items holding commercial value were highly welcomed by all four courts - horses were a major representative of such kinds - but the objects without direct commercial benefit were also exchanged. Musical instruments and the Buddhist canon were more important for the messages they conveyed about Song culture than their financial cost, and active exchanges of these cultural items contributed to form a shared culture in East Asia...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the development of}} US and EU border control capabilities and agendas {{in the wake of}} the September 11, 2001 attacks and international cooperation on international travel, migration and border control to increase security against future terrorist attacks. New US aviation security and border security legislation requires commercial airlines and ships to electronically submit passenger name record (PNR) data and passenger manifests before arrival to the US in order to pick out potential terrorists from growing flows of travelers. Border and visa security legislation also requires that all that visitors and migrants coming to the US carry travel documents containing biometric information and conditions countries â€™ participation in the US Visa Waiver Program (most EU member states) on the issuance of machine-readable, tamper-resistant passports containing biometric data. The paper addresses diplomatic and political challenges inherent in data submission requirements that conflict with EU personal data protection norms as well as the challenges posed by <b>diplomatic</b> <b>reciprocity,</b> privacy protection and domestic political dynamics to the collection and exchange of biometric data...|$|E
