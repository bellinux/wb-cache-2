After scrambling to avoid an armbar attempt, Mann fell to a triangle choke, tapping out at 3:09 of the first round. After the fight, Mann stated [...] "I started off well, standing up, but I fell into his game. Fell into his trap.

500|$|As Seen On TV was {{a highly}} {{acclaimed}} show in the United Kingdom {{by the time it}} ended in 1987. Wood, having just received a BAFTA for the first series, said at the time: [...] "I was very pleased to win, but it really put pressure on me. I was already writing the new series and every time I looked at the award I kept on thinking that people would be expecting so much more now and I just wouldn't be able to live up to it. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>I</b> just put the thing away."

The {{inference}} was that she would make do. But not me!... I screamed at Aaron that bugger Cartiers, I was going to get that diamond if it cost me my life or 2 million dollars whichever was the greater.

500|$|Although {{the film}} {{received}} critical acclaim and several awards, Allen himself was disappointed with it, {{and said in}} an interview, [...] "When Annie Hall started out, that film {{was not supposed to}} be what I wound up with. The film was supposed to be what happens in a guy's mind... Nobody understood anything that went on. The relationship between myself and Diane Keaton was all anyone cared about. That was not what I cared about... <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>I</b> had to reduce the film to just me and Diane Keaton, and that relationship, so I was quite disappointed in that movie". Allen has repeatedly declined to make a sequel, and in a 1992 interview stated that [...] "Sequelism has become an annoying thing. [...] I don't think Francis Coppola should have done Godfather III because Godfather II was quite great. [...] When they make a sequel, it's just a thirst for more money, so I don't like that idea so much".|$|E

My misfortune is that I am still living... Our defeat is very considerable: To me remains 3,000 men from an army of 48,000 men. At the moment in which I report all this, everyone is on the run; I am no more master of my troops. Thinking of the safety of anybody in Berlin is a good activity... It is a cruel failure that I will not survive. The consequences of the battle will be worse than the battle itself. I do not have any more resources, and—frankly confessed—I believe that everything is lost. I will not survive the doom of my fatherland. Farewell forever! ...|$|E

500|$|Kirchherr {{described}} {{how difficult it}} was to be accepted as a female photographer in the 1960s: [...] "Every magazine and newspaper wanted me to photograph the Beatles again. Or they wanted my old stuff, even if it was out of focus, whether they were nice or not. They wouldn't look at my other work. It was very hard for a girl photographer in the 60s to be accepted. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>I</b> gave up. I've hardly taken a photo since 1967." [...] Kirchherr was quoted as saying that When We Was Fab (Genesis Publications 2007), would be her last book of photographs: [...] "I have decided it is time to create one book in which I am totally involved so that it contains the pictures I like most, printed the way I would print them, even down to the text and design.... This book is me and that is why it will be the last one. The very last one." ...|$|E
500|$|A receipt {{found among}} Sibelius's papers {{refers to a}} [...] "Symphonie" [...] being bound by the firm of Weilin & Göös in August 1938. While it is not {{established}} that this transaction related to the Eighth, the Sibelius scholar Kari Kilpeläinen points out {{that none of the}} earlier symphony scores carry the unnumbered heading [...] "Symphonie", and asks: [...] "Could he have omitted the number to prevent news of the now completed Eighth from spreading? Or did he not give the work a number at all, because he was not satisfied with it?" [...] The composer's daughter Katarina spoke of the self-doubt that afflicted her father at this time, aggravated by the continuing expectations and fuss that surrounded the Eighth Symphony. [...] "He wanted it to be better than the other symphonies. Finally it became a burden, even though so much of it had already been written down. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>I</b> don't know whether he would have accepted what he had written." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the role, Kensit spent three days shadowing a real nurse, and observed open heart surgery being performed as research. She commented on the experience: [...] "I wanted to throw up. First of all I stood in the corner but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>I</b> couldn't get close enough ... nurses are incredible women. They're doing this job for next to nothing and do it with such love and care... I couldn't do it, I'd get too emotionally involved, I don't think I could cope." [...] In 2001, Kensit had made a guest appearance in series 16 of Holby City sister show Casualty, appearing as a domestic abuse victim and giving what TV critic Ian Hyland deemed [...] "a convincing performance". Prior to her move into television roles, Kensit had predominantly worked in films, but explained upon joining the cast of Holby City: [...] "Making films isn't for me any more because I'm an old girl in that world ... I've been very lucky, this is something I grew up doing, in television there's so much satisfaction ... I'll {{stay as long as}} they want me, I feel like I've come back home." ...|$|E
6000|$|When I {{look back}} over the past years, am I quite sure that the strange events which I recall may not, in certain cases, be the visionary product of my own disordered brain--realities to me, and to no one else?

Delusions which have been the {{stealthy}} growth of years? delusions which are leading me, by slow degrees, nearer and nearer to madness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end?</b> <b>Is</b> it insane suspicion which has made me so angry with the good friends who {{have been trying to}} save my reason?

500|$|Warner Bros. {{purchased}} the film rights, intending Harold Becker to direct and Robert Shapiro to produce. Tom Stoppard {{wrote the first}} draft of the screenplay, on which Ballard briefly collaborated. Becker dropped out, and David Lean came to direct with Spielberg as producer. Lean explained, [...] "I worked on it for about a year and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>I</b> gave it up because I thought it was too similar to a diary. It was well-written and interesting, but I gave it to Steve." [...] Spielberg felt [...] "from the moment I read J. G. Ballard's novel I secretly wanted to direct myself." [...] Spielberg found the project to be very personal. As a child, his favorite film was Lean's The Bridge on the River Kwai, which similarly takes place in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. Spielberg's fascination with World War II and the aircraft of that era was stimulated by his father's stories of his experience as a radio operator on North American B-25 Mitchell bombers in the China-Burma Theater. Spielberg hired Menno Meyjes to do an uncredited rewrite before Stoppard was brought back to write the shooting script.|$|E
500|$|When I {{was working}} on Season 1 of Adventure Time (2009? 2008?) we had to write a montage song for the episode [...] "Evicted!" [...] while Finn and Jake {{are looking for a}} new house.

[...] was supposed to sound sort of... lame... like sort of… like a lame singer songwriter guy who’s into Dave Matthews but isn’t nearly as talented.

Lyrically, Aguilera wants to thank {{the man who did}} her wrong rather than insult him, because he helped make her stronger and work harder, thus making her a fighter. At the chorus, she sings, [...] "'Cause it makes me that much stronger/ Makes me work a little bit harder/ Makes me that much wiser/ So thanks for making me a fighter". The chords in the guitar part are E5 – F5 – G5 – A5 – B5 − C5 – B5 – A5 – G5 – F5 [...] E5.

I have to ask what's wrong with him. I want to see Bernie next week and ask him what is the reason." [...] Speaking about hitting the pit bollard at his stop, Carlos Sainz Jr. said it had been a [...] "rookie error" [...] due to his urgency to overtake Pastor Maldonado during the pit stops. Daniil Kvyat, who finished 13th after starting in the pit lane complained about the race, saying: [...] "It was pretty boring for me out there this afternoon because a combination of circumstances meant I had to just sit back and was unable to attack.

500|$|In October 1996, {{newspapers}} {{reported that}} BBC bosses had approached Brown about reprising {{her role as}} Dot Cotton and, according to the Daily Mirror, Brown had been in negotiations with EastEnders for several months prior. Brown is quoted by the paper as saying, [...] "I have always been reluctant to go back because I thought Dot's character was not being portrayed properly. I thought it had faded. I always said if Dot comes back it must be as Dot." [...] Brown secured a deal to return and began filming on-location in Gravesend in February 1997. The episode saw Dot's former lodger, Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley), visiting Dot to discover that Nick was once again in prison, leaving Dot alone. Her return episode aired in April 1997. Brown has since revealed that she opted to return to EastEnders to raise her profile again. She had originally only intended to return for a 3-month stint, but was persuaded to stay when a project she {{had been working on}} was cancelled. In July 1997, she commented, [...] "I've decided to stay in EastEnders. They asked me, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>I</b> thought: 'Oh well, I might as well.' Everyone, including Barbara Windsor, Wendy Richard and Adam Woodyatt, was saying: 'Don't leave'. And people were coming up in the street saying: 'It's lovely to have you back.'

40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{discusses}} {{about the}} conditions influencing the usage of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> music classroom. Peter Webster (2002) considers three circumstances allowing or restraining how ICT is employed in music education: (1) technological development; (2) availability and integration; and (3) a constructivist approach being followed for teaching and learning. I will discuss a fourth feature: the similarity between the musical concept supported both by ICT and the school curriculum. I will develop these four circumstances and provide illustrations from a European context. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>ending,</b> <b>I</b> will conclude that the potentiality of teaching materials that use ICT for music education by can be jeopardized for global and economic interests beyond schools. ICT is more than being proficient using technologies, but also being an active reader of mass media productions. Teachers {{should be aware of}} both potentials and risks to promote reflective listeners and thinkers rather than reproductive listeners and consumers...|$|R
