If {{there is no}} appropriate authorized Government department, or the person wishing to commence proceedings has reasonable <b>doubt</b> <b>as</b> to which department (if any) is appropriate, proceedings should be commenced against the Attorney-General. This rule applies to judicial review proceedings in which prerogative orders or declarations are sought.|$|E
5|$|Buffon {{was once}} again the first choice goalkeeper under his former Juventus coach and Trapattoni's {{replacement}} Marcello Lippi, as Italy finished first in their 2006 World Cup qualifying group. Although his place in Italy's 2006 World Cup was initially in <b>doubt,</b> <b>as</b> he was being investigated for possible involvement in the 2006 Calciopoli scandal, he was later named by Lippi as Italy's starting goalkeeper for the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Further, scrutinizing {{legislation}} {{to determine if}} it contravenes fundamental liberties is traditionally {{the function of the}} judiciary.

5|$|In {{people with}} {{suspected}} ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, determination of antibodies against {{glutamic acid decarboxylase}} and islet cells may aid in the decision whether to continue insulin administration long-term (if antibodies are detected), or whether to withdraw insulin and attempt treatment with oral medication as in type 2 diabetes. Generally speaking, routine measurement of C-peptide {{as a measure of}} insulin production is not recommended unless there is genuine <b>doubt</b> <b>as</b> to whether someone has type 1 or type 2 diabetes.|$|E
5|$|A few {{species of}} beetles are ectoparasitic on mammals. One such species, Platypsyllus castoris, parasitises beavers (Castor spp.). This beetle lives as a {{parasite}} {{both as a}} larva and as an adult, feeding on epidermal tissue and possibly on skin secretions and wound exudates. They are strikingly flattened dorsoventrally, no <b>doubt</b> <b>as</b> an adaptation for slipping between the beavers' hairs. They are wingless and eyeless, as are many other ectoparasites. Others are kleptoparasites of other invertebrates, such as the small hive beetle (Aethina tumida) that infests honey bee nests, while many species are parasitic inquilines or commensal in the nests of ants. A few groups of beetles are primary parasitoids of other insects, feeding off of, and eventually killing their hosts.|$|E

5|$|After Sebastian Vettel's {{surprise}} victory {{two weeks}} prior in Malaysia, {{eyes were on}} Ferrari whether {{they would be able}} to continue their good race pace in China and challenge the Mercedes for the win. As lower track temperatures were expected for the race, a serious competitiveness of Ferrari was cast into <b>doubt,</b> <b>as</b> they had benefited from lower tyre degradation in the heat of Malaysia. All ten teams taking part in the championship participated in the race, with Marussia hoping to finally be able to run both cars continually, after Will Stevens had failed to start in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Banksia serrata plants {{generally}} become fire tolerant by five {{to seven}} years of age in that they are able to resprout afterwards. Regrowth is generally from epicormic buds under their thick bark if the plant is between 2 and 6m (7-20ft) high or possibly from the woody subterranean base known as the lignotuber of younger and smaller plants. There is <b>doubt</b> <b>as</b> to whether recovery from a lignotuber is possible, although it has been demonstrated in other Banksia species such as B. menziesii. Stem size is a critical factor; stems with a DBH of under 1cm (0.4in) are unable to withstand low intensity fires. A stem/trunk DBH of 2cm (0.8in) is needed to survive low intensity fires and of around 5cm (2in) to withstand a high intensity fire.|$|E
5|$|Beckett {{struggled}} {{in the early}} part of the 2013 season with an 0â€“5 record and 5.19 ERA in eight starts. He was placed on the disabled list with a groin strain on May 15. While on the disabled list he began to experience numbness and tingling in his hand so he went to see a nerve specialist and expressed <b>doubt</b> <b>as</b> to whether he would be able to pitch again. The Dodgers shut him down from pitching for a month while he underwent a rigorous rehabilitation program in an effort to avoid season-ending surgery. However, the tingling sensation returned when he attempted to resume his throwing program in late June. He was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, which required him to undergo surgery on July 10, 2013 that ended his 2013 season.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{being criticized}} for its limited powers, {{there is also}} some concern that the Council's {{responsibilities}} may go too far. By taking up the function of scrutinizing existing and prospective legislation for differentiating measures and inconsistencies with fundamental liberties, the Council may be encroaching on the functions of constitutional interpretation, which is traditionally the function of courts. Even though the Council has the additional advantage of identifying potentially unconstitutional legislation at an early stage, thereby preventing unnecessary litigation in the future, there is <b>doubt</b> <b>as</b> to the ability of the Council to take on such a task. Given that constitutional interpretation is traditionally the function of lawyers and the courts, the task may be best carried out by the legally trained members of the PCMR.|$|E
5|$|By 1990, Moffat {{had written}} two series of Press Gang, but the programme's high cost along with {{organisational}} changes at Central cast its future in <b>doubt.</b> <b>As</b> Moffat wondered {{what to do}} next and worried about his future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Moffat's father had been a headteacher and Moffat himself had taught English before writing Press Gang, so his initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk, a series that eventually aired in 1997.|$|E

Canada and Belgium had departed before any long-term commitments {{had been made to}} the programme; Canada had found the project politically unpalatable; there was a perception in political circles that much of the manufacturing and specifications were focused on Western Europe. France had made a favourable offer to Belgium on the Dassault Mirage 5, which created <b>doubt</b> <b>as</b> to whether the MRCA would be worthwhile from Belgium's operational perspective.|$|E

The centenary of the line in 1989 saw a renewal of interest and an upgrading of the trains between Chalfont& Latimer and London Marylebone station made commuting more practical, and usage of the line stabilised. The introduction of London Underground S Stock in 2010 led to the replacement of the shuttle service with half-hourly through trains to and from London.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is <b>doubt</b> <b>as</b> to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E
5|$|On {{the steep}} grassy slopes above the River Avon, Bristol rockcress (Arabis scabra) which {{is unique to}} the Avon Gorge can be seen {{flowering}} in April; orchids and western spiked speedwell (Veronica spicata) are common in June and July. In autumn the woodland hosts over 300 species of fungi. Bilberry, a scarce plant in the Bristol area, is found in Leigh Woods, as is the parasitic plant yellow bird's-nest (Monotropa hypopitys). Lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) was discovered here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley; there is <b>doubt</b> <b>as</b> to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. Green-flowered Helleborine (Epipactis phyllanthes) is found {{on the western side}} of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods.|$|E

5|$|Only {{two more}} Windows RT devices, the Microsoft Surface 2 and Nokia Lumia 2520 in late-2013, were {{released}} {{outside of the}} five original launch devices, and no Windows RT counterpart of the Surface Pro 3 was released due to a re-positioning of the Surface line into a high-end market, and a switch to Intel architecture for the Surface 3.

5|$|Pelicans {{give their}} {{name to the}} Pelecaniformes, an order which has a varied taxonomic history.
