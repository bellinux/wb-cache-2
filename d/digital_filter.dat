There are many linear filters which are not analogue in implementation (<b>digital</b> <b>filter),</b> {{and there are many}} electronic filters which may not have a passive topology both of which may have the same transfer function of the filters described in this article. Analogue filters are most often used in wave filtering applications, that is, where it is required to pass particular frequency components and to reject others from analogue (continuous-time) signals.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} design method of {{variable}} IIR <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> based on balanced realizations and minimum round-off noise realizations of <b>digital</b> <b>filters.</b> Highly accurate vari-able <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> are easily derived by the proposed method. The coefficient matrices of both realizations of second-order <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> are obtained directly from prototype realiza-tions. The filter coefficients of variable <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> {{can be obtained}} by frequency transformations to the realizations. The filter coefficients are presented as truncated Taylor se-ries for the purpose of reducing a number of calculations to tune the coefficients. However the proposed filters have highly accurate variable characteristics against the coeffi-cient truncation since balanced realizations and minimum round-off noise realizations have very low coefficient sen-sitivities, which are invariant under the frequency transfor-mations. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the variable <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> designed by the proposed method. 1...|$|R

Design of <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> faces two fundamental problems, their stability and synthesis. Recursive filters have more stability problems than nonrecursive filters. Stability of a filter can be determined by the location of the zero valued region of the denominator polynomial of its transfer function. Stability of recursive filters has been studied by many researchers for the past three decades. Several theorems on stability testing and stabilizing recursive <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> have been already proposed. We present a new approach to test the stability problem of the one-dimensional (1 -D) recursive <b>digital</b> <b>filters</b> using Lagrange Multipliers.
