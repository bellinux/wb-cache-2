500|$|A {{variety of}} subtly {{different}} iteration {{methods have been}} implemented and made available in software packages; reviews and comparisons have been useful but generally refrain from choosing a [...] "best" [...] technique. The software package [...] uses a <b>hill-climbing</b> algorithm to optimize its MSA alignment score and iteratively corrects both alignment weights and locally divergent or [...] "gappy" [...] regions of the growing MSA. PRRP performs best when refining an alignment previously constructed by a faster method.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, {{bicycles}} imported from Great Britain and Continental Europe became popular, especially lighter and more nimble sports roadster models or [...] "English racer". These models featured three-speed gearing, taller wheels, narrower tires and lighter weight (35–40 pounds) and greater <b>hill-climbing</b> ability. By the late 1950s, U.S. manufacturers such as Schwinn began producing {{their own version}} of the English racer.|$|E
60|$|There had {{not been}} much {{conversation}} on the way, for <b>hill-climbing</b> all day at top-speed is not compatible with small talk. Besides, the obvious anxiety of Ravonino rendered his companions less inclined than usual to engage in desultory remarks. Nevertheless there were occasions--during momentary halts to recover breath, or when clear bubbling springs tempted them to drink--when the prolonged silence was broken.|$|E
50|$|He was {{fifth in}} the NCU massed-start {{championship}} and third in the Road Time Trials Council (RTTC) <b>hill-climb</b> championship in 1950. The following year, he was equal 7th in the Isle of Man International, 10th in the NCU massed-start championship, and second in the RTTC <b>hill-climb</b> championship. In 1952 he was fourth in the NCU title race, won the <b>hill-climb</b> championship, and was {{fifth in the}} Isle of Man International.|$|R
5000|$|In 1951 he [...] "travelled abroad, with Peter Bell's 2-litre E.R.A., {{to finish}} 3rd {{overall in the}} Susa/Mont Cenis <b>hill-climb</b> and 4th overall in the Aosta/Grand Saint Bernard <b>hill-climb.</b> With a Cooper 500 he also competed in the German Freiburg <b>hill-climb</b> where he was runner-up in the 500 cc class to Stirling Moss." [...] Wharton won the Freiburg event {{outright}} in the E.R.A. on 5 August, climbing the 7.4 miles of the Schauinsland Pass, in 8 minutes 5.33 seconds. On 19 August he was fastest at the Vue des Alpes <b>hill-climb,</b> {{with a time of}} 3 minutes 57.8 seconds. [...] He won the British Hill Climb Championship every year from 1951 to 1954, and remains the only driver to have won four successive BHCC titles. Other successes with ERA R4D included winning the Brighton Speed Trials in 1954, 1955 and 1956.|$|R

6000|$|Captain Roy {{paused for}} a moment to recover breath, and looking down upon the dense {{tropical}} forest that stretched between him and the Peak of Rakata, he shook his head, and admitted that the merchant was right. Turning round he addressed himself once more to the ascent of the cone, on the sides of which the whole excursion party now straggled and struggled, remarking, as he panted along, that <b>hill-climbing</b> among ashes and cinders didn't [...] "come easy to a sea-farin' man." ...|$|E
60|$|The Captain {{told stories}} of Border warfare--of ambush, firing on the rear-guard, heat that split the skull {{better than any}} tomahawk, cold that {{wrinkled}} the very liver, night-stampedes of baggage-mules, raiding of cattle, and hopeless stern-chases into inhospitable hills, when the cavalry {{knew that they were}} not only being outpaced but outspied. Then he spoke of one fair charge when a tribe gave battle in the open and the troopers rode in swordless, firing right and left with their revolvers and--it was excessively uncomfy for that tribe. And I spoke of what men had told me of huntings in Burma, of <b>hill-climbing</b> in the Black Mountain affair, and so forth.|$|E
60|$|You know, perhaps, what a toy {{engine is}} like. It has the general {{appearance}} of a railway engine; funnels, buffers, cab, and so forth. All these are very elegant things, no doubt; {{but they do not}} make for lightness, they do not facilitate <b>hill-climbing.</b> Now, sometimes an engine gets its clockwork out of order, and then it is over and done for; but sometimes it is merely the outer semblance that is injured--the funnel bent, the body twisted. You remove the things and, behold! you have bare clockwork on wheels, an apparatus of almost malignant energy, soul without body, a kind of metallic rage. This it was that our junior member instantly knew for a 'lectric, and loved from the moment of its stripping.|$|E

6000|$|... § 1. I {{closed the}} last chapter, not because our subject was exhausted, {{but to give}} the reader {{breathing}} time, and because I supposed he would hardly care to turn back suddenly from the subjects of thought last suggested, to the less pregnant matters of inquiry connected with mediæval landscape. Nor was the pause mistimed even as respects the order of our subjects; for hitherto we have been arrested chiefly by {{the beauty of the}} pastures and fields, and have followed the mediæval mind in its fond regard of leaf and flower. But now we have some hard <b>hill-climbing</b> to do; and the remainder of our investigation must be carried on, for the most part, on hands and knees, so that it is not ill done of us first to take breath.|$|E
60|$|But he knew {{perfectly}} well it would go on. And it did. By the time this baby was twelve months old he tottered just one inch under five feet high and scaled eight stone three; he was as big in fact as a St. Peter's in Vaticano cherub, and his affectionate clutch at the hair and features of visitors became the talk of West Kensington. They had an invalid's chair to carry {{him up and down}} to his nursery, and his special nurse, a muscular young person just out of training, used to take him for his airings in a Panhard 8 h.p. <b>hill-climbing</b> perambulator specially made to meet his requirement. It was lucky in every way that Redwood had his expert witness connection in addition to his professorship.|$|E
60|$|They went, with ardor {{and some}} thoroughness, into the matters of {{streamline}} bodies, <b>hill-climbing</b> power, wire wheels, chrome steel, ignition systems, and body colors. It {{was much more}} than a study of transportation. It was an aspiration for knightly rank. In the city of Zenith, in the barbarous twentieth century, a family's motor indicated its social rank as precisely as the grades of the peerage determined the rank of an English family--indeed, more precisely, considering the opinion of old county families upon newly created brewery barons and woolen-mill viscounts. The details of precedence were never officially determined. There was no court to decide whether the second son of a Pierce Arrow limousine should go in to dinner before the first son of a Buick roadster, but of their respective social importance there was no doubt; and where Babbitt as a boy had aspired to the presidency, his son Ted aspired to a Packard twin-six and an established position in the motored gentry.|$|E

6000|$|The {{difficulties}} of the way were greater than had been anticipated. There was no path; the rocks, cliffs, and gullies were precipitous; and the underwood was thick and tangled, insomuch that Mr Cupples sat down once or twice and begged to be left where he was, saying {{that he would take}} his chance of being caught, and could feed quite well on cocoa-nuts! This, however, was not listened to. Poor Cupples was dragged along, half by persuasion and half by force. Sailors, as a class, are not celebrated for pedestrian powers, and Cupples was a singularly bad specimen of his class. Muggins, although pretty well knocked up before morning, held on manfully without a murmur. The captain, too, albeit a heavy man, and fat, and addicted to panting and profuse perspiration, declared that he was game for anything, and would never be guilty of saying [...] "die" [...] as long as there was [...] "a shot in the locker." [...] As for Larry O'Hale, {{he was a man of}} iron mould, one of those giants who seem to be incapable of being worn out or crushed by any amount of physical exertion. So far was he from being exhausted, that he threatened to carry Mr Cupples if he should again talk of falling behind. We need scarcely say that Wandering Will was quite equal to the occasion. Besides being a powerful fellow for his age, he was lithe, active, and hopeful, and, having been accustomed to <b>hill-climbing</b> from boyhood, could have left the whole party behind with ease.|$|E
