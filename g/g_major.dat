5|$|Bach {{performed}} the cantata again, probably in 1730. He later reworked {{the music of}} the opening chorus and a duet again in his Missa in <b>G</b> <b>major,</b> BWV 236, and the music of an alto aria in his Missa in A major, BWV 234.|$|E

5|$|The five-minute, 40-second gospel {{song was}} written in the key of <b>G</b> <b>major</b> with a tempo of 103 beats per minute. Instrumentation is {{provided}} by piano, organ, vibraphone, glockenspiel, harmonica, and a guitar. The instruments were played by Tribbett, Fair, Paul Jackson, Jr., and Frank Brunot.|$|E
5|$|The {{melodic line}} of part B is {{contrasting}} in both its static {{character and the}} vehemence of the piano accompaniment, and by the double forte dynamics, as much by the double forte dynamics which give a brutal character, as {{by the use of}} sequences (E major to begin with, then B major, <b>G</b> <b>major,</b> E major, etc.). This section ends with a chromatic descent in the accompaniment at quadruple piano dynamic, up to a dominant seventh of <b>G</b> <b>major,</b> to prepare the return of the second section A in the original key.|$|E
5|$|At (1:18), the song's main melody is introduced, {{played by}} a guitar, the bass guitar and a glockenspiel, with a chord {{progression}} of E minor, C major seventh, <b>G</b> <b>major,</b> and D major. This is repeated until (3:28), when the guitars fade out into the background, and the drumbeat ends, leaving only the ride cymbal to keep the beat, and the main melody, which is repeated until it gradually fades out, leaving ambient guitar noise.|$|E
50|$|Another verse {{featuring}} the same previous structure, and another kazoo solo {{in the same}} E major scale return again. This gives way to a chorus using the barre chord progression of D flat <b>major,</b> <b>G</b> flat <b>major,</b> E <b>major,</b> B <b>major,</b> <b>G</b> flat <b>major</b> and D flat major. The chorus is in 6/8 time, but switches to one bar of 4/4 {{at the end of}} every chord progression, and four bars of 4/4 {{at the end of every}} chorus. Parker's vocals are heavily reverbed and delayed to give it a spacy atmosphere.|$|R

5|$|Gobioolithus {{eggs are}} small and smooth-shelled. They are asymmetrically shaped, similar to many modern bird eggs, with one end pointier than the other. The two oospecies are {{distinguished}} mainly by their size: <b>G.</b> <b>major</b> ranges from 50 to 53.5mm long and 25 to 32mm across, with an eggshell thickness of 0.2-0.4mm, whereas G. minor is only 30-46mm by 20-24mm and 0.1-0.2mm thick.|$|E
5|$|The Piano Concerto in <b>G</b> <b>major</b> was {{completed}} a year later. After the premiere in January 1932 there was high {{praise for the}} soloist, Marguerite Long, and for Ravel's score, though not for his conducting. Long, the dedicatee, played the concerto in more than twenty European cities, with the composer conducting; they planned to record it together, but at the sessions Ravel confined himself to supervising proceedings and Pedro de Freitas Branco conducted.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} national anthem was in the key of <b>G</b> <b>major,</b> but in 1983, schools were issued an educational tape describing common mistakes made in singing the anthem and given the option of singing the anthem in F major. (It was the very version that was first demonstrated to the public during the 1986 Singapore National Day Parade.) In 1993, the shorter version of Majulah Singapura was declared to be the official one.|$|E

5|$|The song uses two-measure phrases that, {{aside from}} the choruses, use a i–III–IV–VI chord progression. The B minor chord is held for 1⅓ of a beat, and a {{relative}} transformation is then used to produce a second-inversion D major chord, which is held for 1⅔ of a beat. In the second measure, a first-inversion E major chord with an added ninth precedes a <b>G</b> <b>major</b> major seventh chord; the chords are held for the same durations as the previous two.|$|E
5|$|While {{the first}} version of the song had stayed largely in the key of <b>G</b> <b>major</b> (except for {{transient}} modulation to F and perhaps C in the bridges), the reprise starts in F and features a modulation, to G. The mono and stereo mixes of the song differ slightly: the former has a fractionally different transition from the previous song, and includes crowd noise and laughter in the opening bars that are absent from the stereo mix.|$|E
5|$|Written for piano, guitar, and mandolin, {{the music}} {{begins in the}} key of <b>G</b> <b>major</b> with an Andante Moderato tempo. The verses follow a chord {{progression}} of G–C–G. The chorus transitions to B minor, and progresses as B–E–E, before returning to G–C–G in its final bars. Although the melody of the chorus is unique within the piece, it is in harmonic unity with the verses. An upbeat version played at a Andantino tempo was also adapted for play by small orchestras and big bands.|$|E
50|$|Trio in D major is {{the most}} {{traditional}} piece in the opus. It lacks the <b>G</b> <b>major's</b> symphonic effects but conveys a finely subtle chamber music with warm and intimate atmosphere. However the slow movement in D minor is perhaps the saddest piece in the opus.|$|R

5|$|In September 1883 he went as a boarder to Field House Preparatory School in Rottingdean on {{the south}} coast of England, forty miles from Wotton. He was {{generally}} happy there, although he was shocked to encounter {{for the first time}} social snobbery and political conservatism which were rife among his fellow pupils. From there he moved on to the public school Charterhouse in January 1887. His academic and sporting achievements there were satisfactory, and the school encouraged his musical development. In 1888 he organised a concert in the school hall, which included a performance of his <b>G</b> <b>major</b> Piano Trio (now lost) with the composer as violinist.|$|E
5|$|Other {{works that}} {{followed}} continued the composer's new-found seriousness, including many settings of Éluard's surrealist and humanist poems. In 1937 he composed {{his first major}} liturgical work, the Mass in <b>G</b> <b>major</b> for soprano and mixed choir a cappella, which {{has become the most}} frequently performed of all his sacred works. Poulenc's new compositions were not all in this serious vein; his incidental music to the play La Reine Margot, starring Yvonne Printemps, was pastiche 16th-century dance music, and became popular under the title Suite française. Music critics generally continued to define Poulenc by his light-hearted works, and {{it was not until the}} 1950s that his serious side was widely recognised.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the second}} movement, {{there is a}} brief fourteen-bar {{transitional}} passage in E minor for solo violin and strings only. This leads into the lively and effervescent finale, the whole of which is in E major and whose opening {{is marked by a}} trumpet fanfare. This movement is in sonata rondo form with an opening theme requiring fast passage work from the soloist. The opening exposition leads into a brief second B major theme which is played by the soloist and builds to a series of rapidly ascending and descending arpeggios, reminiscent of the cadenza from the first movement. The orchestra then plays a variation of the opening melody, after which the music moves into a short development section in <b>G</b> <b>major.</b> The recapitulation is essentially similar to the exposition, apart from the addition of a counter-melody in the strings. The second theme is repeated, this time in the home key of E Major. There is almost a small cadenza {{near the end of the}} movement when the woodwinds play the main tune against prolonged trills from the solo violin. The concerto then concludes with a frenetic coda.|$|E
50|$|From this, the {{musician}} {{would go to}} <b>G</b> <b>major's</b> relative minor which is E minor, and potentially to C major and D major's related minor as well (a musician who does not know the related minor for C and D major may also go P5 below or above E minor).|$|R

5|$|Mozart had a pet common {{starling}} {{which could}} sing {{part of his}} Piano Concerto in <b>G</b> <b>Major</b> (KV. 453). He had bought it from a shop after hearing it sing a phrase from a work he wrote six weeks previously, which {{had not yet been}} performed in public. He became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later. It has been suggested that his A Musical Joke (K. 522) might be written in the comical, inconsequential style of a starling's vocalisation. Other people who have owned common starlings report how adept they are at picking up phrases and expressions. The words have no meaning for the starling, so they often mix them up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs. Their ability at mimicry is so great that strangers have looked in vain for the human they think they have just heard speak.|$|E
5|$|Instead of an orchestral tutti, the concerto {{opens with}} the almost {{immediate}} entry of the solo violin, playing the very tune in E minor that gave Mendelssohn no peace. Following a bravura of rapidly ascending notes, the opening theme is then restated by the orchestra. There is then a frenetic chromatic transition passage {{as the music}} subsides and modulates into a tranquil second subject theme in <b>G</b> <b>major.</b> The melody is initially played by the woodwinds with the soloist providing a pedal note on an open G string. The tune is played by the solo violin itself before a short codetta ends the exposition section of the opening movement. The opening two themes are then combined in the development section, where the music builds up to the innovative cadenza, which Mendelssohn wrote out in full rather than allowing the soloist to improvise. The cadenza builds up speed through rhythmic shifts from quavers to quaver-triplets and finally to semiquavers, which require ricochet bowing from the soloist. This serves as {{a link to the}} recapitulation, where the opening melody is played by the orchestra, accompanied by the continuing ricochet arpeggios by the soloist. During the recapitulation, the opening themes are repeated with the second theme being played in the E major before returning to E minor for the closing of the movement. The music gathers speed into the coda, which is marked 'Presto', before a variant of the original chromatic transition passage ends the first movement.|$|E
