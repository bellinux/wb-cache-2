5|$|A {{man from}} Northern Ireland was {{discussed}} in the media {{in connection with the}} disappearance. After being released from prison for the sexual assault of his four daughters, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>moved</b> to Carvoeiro, Portugal, not far from Praia da Luz, and was there when Madeleine went missing. He died in 2013. Another focus of Operation Grange was Urs Hans von Aesch, a deceased Swiss man implicated in the 2007 murder, in Switzerland, of five-year-old Ylenia Lenhard. Ylenia disappeared on 31 July 2007, nearly three months after Madeleine, and was found dead in September as a result of toluene poisoning. Von Aesch was living in Spain when Madeleine disappeared.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from baseball, Taylor moved to Raleigh, North Carolina with his five daughters {{and worked as}} a UPS package handler, then worked as a beer distributor. By 2006, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>moved</b> back home and was working as a bricklayer with his father. In January 2005, police charged Taylor with misdemeanor child abuse for allegedly leaving four of his children (ages from 2 to 11) alone for more than eight hours. He did not show up for his court date, and at one point there were four outstanding warrants for his arrest.|$|E

5|$|By 1860, Smith {{was doing}} very well; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>moved</b> to Leonard Street within the Fifth Ward {{and had a}} mansion built by white workmen. His total real {{property}} was worth $25,000. His household included a live-in servant, Catherine Grelis from Ireland. Listed as a separate household at his address were Sara D. Williams, 57, and Mary Hertell (should be Hewlitt, as above), 50. (These were likely the same Sara and Mary as in the 1850 census, although their ages did not change.) No one on this census page had a racial designation. By the conventions of the time, this means that they were classified as white by the census enumerator; totals of white persons only are given {{at the bottom of}} the page.|$|E
5|$|In 1800 he {{was still}} doing {{engineering}} work for his former employers, who were beset with manufacturing problems and a shortage of engine-erectors. He was also running his own business engaged in general millwrighting and was still called upon by various Manchester engine owners who preferred to use his services for their machine erection and maintenance needs than those of Boulton and Watt. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>moved</b> to New Street, Hanover Street and in December 1799 {{was appointed to the}} position of conductor of firemen and inspector of engines by the Manchester police commissioners, positions which effectively put him in charge of the fire brigade. One source– the one considered unreliable by Chaloner– has stated that he had held the position for 20 years prior to his death.|$|E
5|$|Matthews {{said in a}} 2006 Alien Experience {{interview}} that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>moved</b> to the United Kingdom due {{to the treatment of}} his fellow Vietnam War veterans and was acting in The American Way when Cameron offered him the role of Apone. Using his military experience, Matthews consulted with the film crew and helped direct the actors playing Colonial Marines. According to fellow Aliens actor Daniel Kash, Matthews improvised much of his performance and based it on his Vietnam War experience. His performance influenced the military science fiction subgenre, with the charismatic black commander inspiring the character of Sergeant Avery Johnson in the Halo video-game franchise.|$|E

5|$|One {{argument}} leveled by Westmoreland at {{the time}} (and often quoted by historians of the battle) was that only two Marine regiments were tied down at Khe Sanh compared with several NVA divisions. But, {{at the time}} Hanoi {{made the decision to}} move in around the base, Khe Sanh was held by only two (or even just one) American battalions. It is debatable whether the destruction of one battalion could have been the goal of two to four NVA divisions. Yet, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never moved on to the next logical level. By the end of January 1968, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>moved</b> half of all US combat troops—nearly fifty maneuver battalions—to I Corps.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year Lie purchased publishing {{rights to the}} Malay-language newspaper Pembrita Betawi, based in Batavia and edited by W. Meulenhoff, for 1,000gulden. He again borrowed from his friends. From mid-1886, Lie's publishing house (which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>moved</b> to Batavia) was credited as the newspaper's printer. While busy with the press, he wrote or contributed to four books. Two were pieces of nonfiction, one a collection of Chinese prophecies and the last outlined lease laws. The third was a partial translation of the One Thousand and One Nights, a collection already popular with Malay audiences. The last was his first novel, Tjhit Liap Seng. Following a group of educated persons in mainland China, Tjhit Liap Seng is credited as the first Chinese Malay novel.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Shakespeare divided {{his time}} between London and Stratford. In 1596, the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare {{was living in the}} parish of St. Helen's, Bishopsgate, north of the River Thames. He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the same year his company {{constructed}} the Globe Theatre there. By 1604, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>moved</b> north of the river again, to an area north of St Paul's Cathedral with many fine houses. There, he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of ladies' wigs and other headgear.|$|E

He kept a clean sheet as United cruised through to the next round winning 3–0. He played again in the {{following}} round away at Aldershot Town, a game which United also won 3–0 and advanced to the quarter finals. He was in goal again for United's League Cup game in a defeat against Championship club Crystal Palace on 30 November. It also seemed that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>moved</b> above last season's second choice Tomasz Kuszczak in the pecking order, but was now third choice behind Anders Lindegaard and David de Gea. He {{made his first}} Premier League start in a 2–0 home win against Stoke City on 31 January 2012, keeping a clean sheet on his debut.|$|E

He was considered one of the first modern independent filmmakers, and was credited with breaking new ground for other independent filmmakers, particularly for the Arkansas film industry.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{was born}} Neumann János Lajos to a wealthy, acculturated and non-observant Jewish family (in Hungarian {{the family name}} comes first. His given names equate to John Louis in English). His Hebrew name was Yonah. Von Neumann's was born in Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was the eldest of three children. He had two younger brothers: Michael, born in 1907, and Nicholas, {{who was born in}} 1911. His father, Neumann Miksa (English: Max Neumann) was a banker, who held a {{doctorate}} in law. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>moved</b> to Budapest from Pécs {{at the end of the}} 1880s. Miksa's father and grandfather were both born in Ond (now part of the town of Szerencs), Zemplén County, northern Hungary. John's mother was Kann Margit (English: Margaret Kann); her parents were Jakab Kann and Katalin Meisels. Three generations of the Kann family lived in spacious apartments above the Kann-Heller offices in Budapest; von Neumann's family occupied an 18-room apartment on the top floor.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} congressional debate in which Rowan participated {{was over the}} {{election}} of William McCreery as representative from Baltimore, Maryland. Joshua Barney, McCreery's opponent in the election, claimed that McCreery did not meet a requirement in the Maryland Constitution that a representative live in the district from which he was elected for twelve {{months prior to the}} election. McCreery admitted that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>moved</b> from Baltimore to the country prior to the election but claimed that he still owned his home in Baltimore and lived there during the winter months. A resolution was introduced to declare McCreery the duly elected representative from Baltimore, and an amendment was added to clarify that the grounds upon which the resolution was based were that McCreery had not abandoned his Baltimore home. Despite his support for states' rights, Rowan opposed the amendment because he felt that state sovereignty was only made possible by national sovereignty and that the national legislature had the right to declare a state law unconstitutional. By giving another reason for declaring McCreery duly elected, Rowan felt this issue would be obscured. The amendment was defeated by a vote of 92–8, and the resolution to declare McCreery duly elected passed 89–18.|$|E
