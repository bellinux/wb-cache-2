25|$|Immediately after Grouping, new engines were {{numbered}} in {{the series}} used by their constituent company that had ordered them; including the onward transfer of older locomotives to the appropriate <b>duplicate</b> <b>list.</b> Subsequently the new numbering systems of 1923 and 1924 {{were used in the}} same way.|$|R

5000|$|Every six months, the NBR renumbered {{some of its}} older {{locomotives}} into a [...] "duplicate list", {{in order}} to vacate numbers for new construction.

5000|$|Early {{members of}} the class were {{numbered}} in a continuous series of new numbers 395-406. Some later batches re-used numbers of withdrawn or duplicated locomotives.

Between 1908 and 1924, 54 locomotives were renumbered to the <b>duplicate</b> <b>list</b> by prefixing their existing number with a [...] "0".|$|R

Numbers 07228 and 7230 became departmental locomotives at Stratford, with the former being withdrawn in 1927, after having been used as a stationary boiler.
