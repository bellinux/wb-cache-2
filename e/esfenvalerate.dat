50|$|The {{sunflower}} beetle {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} most damaging defoliators of cultivated sunflowers in North America. Advice published by Kansas State University in 2016 recommends the use of insecticide treatment of sunflower crops if any of the following conditions are met: one adult beetle is present per seedling, larvae reach numbers of 10-15 per plant on upper leaves, or 25 percent defoliation occurs and pupation has not begun. Given the short larval and adult lifecycle, delayed planting of sunflower crops is effective in preventing yield reductions caused by sunflower beetle.

5000|$|Studies on {{pesticides}} and olfaction in fishes {{have looked at}} neurophysiological effects, behavioral effects, and reproductive effects. Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides are neurotoxins that cause acetylcholinesterase inhibition in fish. Acetyl cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides are known to cause hyposmia. Acetylcholinesterase plays an essential role within the olfactory epithelium related to mucous production. Diazinon, an organophosphate, was found to disrupt olfactory pheromone signals that induced antipredator behavior, such as predator avoidance. It also disrupts homing behavior in Chinook salmon at environmentally-relevant concentrations. Fewer diazinon-treated chinook returned to the hatchery than control fish.Studies have found that olfactory sensory neurons {{do not respond to}} certain pesticides. Fish did not detect chlorpyrifos, <b>esfenvalerate,</b> and atrazine using their sense of smell and did not avoid waters contaminated with these chemicals. This contrasts metals, which elicits an avoidance response in fish. Round-up was only avoided at concentrations that caused acute lethality. Ovulating female salmon release a pheromone in their urine. After detection by the olfactory system of mature male salmon parr, plasma sex steroids and milt increase. [...] A synthetic pyrethroid pesticide, cypermethrin, reduced or inhibited normal olfactory system response in males to the priming effect of these pheromones. Atrazine, carbofuran and diazinon were also found to reduce olfactory detection of female priming pheromones by male Atlantic salmon parr.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Aquatic {{insects are}} {{essential}} components of healthy stream ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling, trophic dynamics and other ecological functions. Aquatic insect species, {{particularly those in}} the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT taxa) are however, extremely sensitive to insecticide contamination. Given that urban and agricultural use of synthetic pyrethroid insecticides are increasing, there is concern that aquatic contamination by these compounds may pose a risk to aquatic insect species. The overarching hypothesis {{of this research is}} that specific aquatic insect life history attributes may increase their susceptibility to synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, through an exacerbation of toxic effects and/or enhancement of exposure. The goals of this work were (a) to determine if egg morphology affects <b>esfenvalerate</b> sensitivity, (b) to ascertain the impact of dietary exposure to <b>esfenvalerate</b> among different functional feeding groups, (c) to determine the effect of <b>esfenvalerate</b> intoxication on larval caddisfly case maintenance, and (d) to establish the effects of late-stage <b>esfenvalerate</b> exposure on emergence. Four different aquatic insect species were utilized during the course of these studies; Cinygmula reticulata McDonough (Ephemeroptera: Heptageniidae), Hesperoperla pacifica Banks (Plecoptera: Perlidae), and Brachycentrus americanus Banks (Trichoptera: Brachycentridae) were used in the majority of the experiments. Baetis sp. (Ephemeroptera: Baetidae) egg clutches were utilized as a surrogate for the difficult-to-obtain C. reticulata eggs. <b>Esfenvalerate</b> toxicity testing with aquatic insect eggs indicated that 48 h <b>esfenvalerate</b> exposures ranging between 0. 07 and 0. 5 μg/L caused significant Baetis sp egg mortality. Exposure to lower concentrations immediately preceding hatch resulted in behavioral aberrations in first instar mayflies. The gelatinous clutch structure of caddisfly eggs proved to be the most susceptible egg morphology tested, with significant within-clutch mortality occurring following <b>esfenvalerate</b> exposures of 0. 035 μg/L. No toxic effect was observed in H. pacifica eggs exposed to up to 1. 0 μg/L <b>esfenvalerate.</b> Esfenvalerate-contaminated food caused adverse effects in both C. reticulata and B. americanus insects, but not in H. pacifica nymphs. A significant decrease in growth was observed in small C. reticulata nymphs reared on 0. 05 μg/L esfenvalerate-exposed algae, and a decrease in egg production in final-instar nymphs reared on 0. 1 μg/L esfenvalerate-exposed algae. Diet items exposed to <b>esfenvalerate</b> concentrations ranging between 0. 5 to 1. 0 μg/L induced case-abandonment in fourth-instar B. americanus larvae. None of the aquatic insect species differentiated between esfenvalerate-contaminated and clean food sources during feeding. 48 h waterborne exposures of 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 4 μg/L <b>esfenvalerate</b> also caused fourth-instar larvae to abandon cases, and impaired their ability to rebuild these protective structures. Finally, C. reticulata emergence was disrupted by <b>esfenvalerate</b> exposures ranging from 0. 005 to 0. 015 μg/L, resulting in significant mortality. B. americanus pupal exposures of 0. 05, 0. 1, and 0. 2 μg/L <b>esfenvalerate</b> significantly reduced successful adult emergence and resulted in decreased egg weight of emerged females. A comparison of life stage <b>esfenvalerate</b> sensitivities of C. reticulata and B. americanus reveals that analogous life stages did not exhibit the same relative susceptibilities, with final-instar nymphs the most sensitive C. reticulata life stage tested, and egg clutches as the most sensitive B. americanus life stage...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Sublethal {{concentrations}} of pollutants may compromise fish, resulting in increased susceptibility to endemic pathogens. To test this hypothesis, juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) {{were exposed to}} sublethal levels of <b>esfenvalerate</b> or chlorpyrifos either alone or concurrently with infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV). Three trials were performed with fish exposed to {{concentrations of}} IHNV between 0. 8 � 10 2 and 2. 7 � 10 6 plaque-forming units/ml and to 5. 0 �g/L of chlorpyrifos or 0. 1 �g/L of <b>esfenvalerate.</b> The presence and concentration of IHNV in dead fish were assayed by virus isolation and plaque assay techniques, respectively. Among groups exposed to both <b>esfenvalerate</b> and IHNV, 83 % experienced highly significant (p � 0. 001) mortality, ranging from 20 to 90 % at 3 d post–virus exposure, and cumulatively died from 2. 4 to 7. 7 d sooner than fish exposed to IHNV alone. This trend was not seen in any other treatment group. Virus assays of dead fish indicate a lethal synergism of <b>esfenvalerate</b> and IHNV. Chlorpyrifos had no observed effect on total mortality or IHNV susceptibility. The present results suggest that accepted levels of pollutants may be seemingly nonlethal to fish but, in fact, be acting synergistically with endemic pathogens to compromise survivorship of wild fish populations through immunologic or physiologic disruption.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the effects of a short and {{environmentally}} realistic pulse exposure of different life stages of the freshwater amphipod, Gammarus pulex, to the pyrethroid insecticide, <b>esfenvalerate.</b> We were particularly interested in determining the extent to which detectable effects on key life-history traits persisted following cessation of a brief exposure to this pesticide. Our results indicate that environmentally realistic exposure concentrations of this widely used insecticide can have a significant effect on the survival and reproduction of Gammarus pulex. Comparison of LC 50 values indicates that G. pulex has a similar sensitivity to <b>esfenvalerate</b> as the standard test invertebrate, Daphnia magna and is more sensitive than other common stream invertebrates. Despite 100 % survival during pulses of up to 2 μg l− 1, mortality increased, in some cases markedly, following transfer to clean conditions. Pulse exposure to <b>esfenvalerate</b> at concentrations in the range 0. 1 – 0. 6 μg l− 1 for as little as 1 h can have effects on G. pulex survival, pairing behavior, and reproductive output that can still be detected at least 2 weeks following the pulse. Reproductive traits were very sensitive to <b>esfenvalerate,</b> and exposure to 0. 05 μg l− 1 for 1 h led to immediate disruption of reproducing pairs, release of eggs or offspring from the brood pouch, and substantial delays in pair formation and subsequent reproduction following transfer to clean water. The kinds of effects on reproductive behavior observed in this study could potentially impact the population dynamics of G. pulex in the field.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} assessed the susceptibility of Oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), to selected insecticides and mixtures. Two populations – a laboratory colony from Rutgers University and a colony established in 2007 from orchards in Calhoun County, Illinois – were tested. Both colonies were reared concurrently on lima bean diet and ‘Gala’ apples to reduce the likelihood that either colony would be lost to diseases or other factors. Bioassays were analyzed separately for each colony and for progeny of parents reared on each food source. To determine the baseline susceptibility of G. molesta to chlorantraniliprole, spinetoram, spinosad, acetamiprid, thiamethoxam, <b>esfenvalerate,</b> and lambda-cyhalothrin, neonates were placed on wheat germ diet containing a range of concentrations of each insecticide. Overall, the two colonies responded similarly to these insecticides, regardless of parental food source. Results of these bioassays provide baseline data for future monitoring of of resistance. To develop and test a diagnostic dose for estimation of pyrethroid resistance in the field, the dose-mortality relationship was described for <b>esfenvalerate</b> applied topically to adult males. A range of concentrations was applied in 1 μl of acetone to male moths from the Rutgers colony, and the LD 99 {{was estimated to be}} 0. 022 μg per moth. Application of 0. 022 μg <b>esfenvalerate</b> per moth to ca. 600 male moths from two putatively susceptible populations resulted in mean survivorship approximately equal to the expected level of 1. 0 %. Application of this dose to ca. 375 moths captured in two Calhoun County orchards with histories of pyrethroid use resulted in mean survivorship of 9. 4 % and 82 %. It is proposed that 0. 022 μg of <b>esfenvalerate</b> in 1 μl of acetone be used as a diagnostic dose for monitoring pyrethroid resistance. iii The toxicities of three mixtures of insecticides to neonates were estimated. Chlorantraniliprole was mixed with acetamiprid, <b>esfenvalerate,</b> or thiamethoxam. These insecticides may be mixed or rotated to provide broad spectrum control of orchard pests. Mixtures of chlorantraniliprole with acetamiprid or thiamethoxam did not exhibit consistent synergism or antagonism. For chlorantraniliprole plus <b>esfenvalerate,</b> mortality was less than expected at nearly all concentrations for both colonies, suggesting antagonism despite different modes of action for the two compounds. The effectiveness of one or both insecticides to Oriental fruit moth might be reduced if they are combined in field applications. To estimate the toxicity of novaluron, an insect growth regulator, to eggs of the two colonies, eggs on waxed paper were dipped into a range of concentrations.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 The {{feasibility}} of managing codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), with mixtures of Bacillus thuringiensis-based microbial and selected chemical insecticides was studied under laboratory and field conditions. Joint actions (synergism, additivity and antagonism) of these mixtures were determined for both egg and larval stages. Higher rates of microbial control agents (MCAs), Dipel® 2 X and MVP®, combined {{with low to}} medium rates of chemical insecticides gave additive or synergistic egg and/or larval mortality. <b>Esfenvalerate</b> and permethrin synergised {{the effect of these}} MCAs, whereas carbaryl, azinphosmethyl, phosmet and diflubenzuron had an additive effects. For all chemical insecticides, often the interactions were better with Dipel than MVP. Generally, egg exposure to low rates of the chemical insecticides alone or in combination with MCAs, caused the larvae hatching from these eggs to be more susceptible to insecticides-MCA mixtures. Most mixtures produced better results when treated at the blackhead stage of egg development. Adult and larval exposure to sublethal rates of azinphosmethyl, phosmet, carbaryl, <b>esfenvalerate</b> and permethrin manifested short- and long-term effects. Adult exposure caused deleterious effects on the survival and oviposition, and the larval exposures affected survival and pupal formation. Carbaryl, <b>esfenvalerate</b> and permethrin affected the pupal survival and subsequent eclosion of adults. Only <b>esfenvalerate</b> and permethrin significantly extended the larval period and reduced pupal weight and subsequent egg deposition. The deleterious sublethal effects of pyrethroids observed in the present study may provide added control of codling moth in the field. Diflubenzuron and MCAs had neither adulticidal activity nor long-term effects on codling moth biology. Results of field efficacy tests indicate that utilization of mixtures of Dipel with low rates of pyrethroids (0. 1 - 0. 2 X) or diflubenzuron (0. 25 - 0. 50 X) in the codling moth management is possible and indeed might be beneficial. Dipel-diflubenzuron mixtures were only suitable when applied 3 times/generation. These mixtures were environmentally safe and did not cause any outbreak of phytophagous mites. Standard application rate (2 times/generation) and timing were found to be appropriate for Dipel-pyrethroid (<b>esfenvalerate</b> and permethrin) mixtures. These pyrethroids at all test rates (0. 1 - 1. 0 X), applied alone or mixed with MCAs, were toxic to predatory phytoseiids, thus caused an outbreak of European red mite and yellow spider mites particularly at higher rates. However, mixtures of Dipel and 0. 1 X of esfenvalerate/permethrin were less disruptive than corresponding 0. 2 - 1. 0 X standard rate. These mixtures were selective to most predatory insects, spiders and Zetzellia malt. Hence, use of these mixtures instead of full rate of pyrethroids may improve the prospects of biological control of insect and mite pests in apple orchards...|$|E

40|$|<b>Esfenvalerate</b> {{belongs to}} the {{pyrethroid}} group of insecticides which display significant selective toxicity against insects compared to mammalian species, nevertheless, they may pose health risks, especially in case of accidental exposure. The aim {{of the present study}} was to model the effect of acute, relatively high-dose exposure of the esfenvalerate-containing formulation Sumi-Alpha®. Eventual functional alterations in the central nervous system and in the gastrointestinal tract were studied on in vitro tissue preparations at different delays after intragastric administration to rats. Neuronal effects were characterized by field potential recording in cortical and hippocampal brain slices, while gastrointestinal effects were examined by analyzing the motility and excitability of isolated ileum segments. On the brain slices originating from esfenvalerate-treated animals, changes in excitability of both inhibitory and excitatory type could be observed. Voltage thresholds necessary to evoke responses in neocortex slices were elevated, and population spike amplitudes were lower in hippocampal slices. However, epileptiform potentials with pronounced late components were also observed. A decreased long-term potentiation (LTP) could be seen in both brain areas after <b>esfenvalerate</b> treatment. Seizure susceptibility of the slices was not significantly altered, but tended to be somewhat higher in slices originating from treated rats. In ileum segments, both spontaneous and acetyl-choline (ACh) -elicited contractions were modified by treatment. <b>Esfenvalerate</b> raised the amplitude of contractions in the low ACh concentration range. However, the solvent xylene also considerably contributed to the detected changes. We can conclude that a relatively high, single oral dose of Sumi-Alpha® exerted mild and temporary effects on the elementary brain functions and intestine functions of the rat...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) is a {{pelagic fish}} species listed as {{endangered}} under both the USA Federal and Californian State Endangered Species Acts and considered {{an indicator of}} ecosystem health in its habitat range, which {{is limited to the}} Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary in California, USA. Anthropogenic contaminants are one of multiple stressors affecting this system, and among them, current-use insecticides are of major concern. Interrogative tools are required to successfully monitor effects of contaminants on the delta smelt, and to research potential causes of population decline in this species. We have created a microarray to investigate genome-wide effects of potentially causative stressors, and applied this tool to assess effects of the pyrethroid insecticide <b>esfenvalerate</b> on larval delta smelt. Selected genes were further investigated as molecular biomarkers using quantitative PCR analyses. Results Exposure to <b>esfenvalerate</b> affected swimming behavior of larval delta smelt at concentrations as low as 0. 0625 &# 956;g. L- 1, and significant differences in expression were measured in genes involved in neuromuscular activity. Alterations in the expression of genes associated with immune responses, along with apoptosis, redox, osmotic stress, detoxification, and growth and development appear to have been invoked by <b>esfenvalerate</b> exposure. Swimming impairment correlated significantly with expression of aspartoacylase (ASPA), an enzyme involved in brain cell function and associated with numerous human diseases. Selected genes were investigated for their use as molecular biomarkers, and strong links were determined between measured downregulation in ASPA and observed behavioral responses in fish exposed to environmentally relevant pyrethroid concentrations. Conclusions The results of this study show that microarray technology is a useful approach in screening for, and generation of molecular biomarkers in endangered, non-model organisms, identifying specific genes that can be directly linked with sublethal toxicological endpoints; such as changes in expression levels of neuromuscular genes resulting in measurable swimming impairments. The developed microarrays were successfully applied on larval fish exposed to <b>esfenvalerate,</b> a known contaminant of the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary, and has permitted the identification of specific biomarkers which could provide insight into the factors contributing to delta smelt population decline...|$|E
40|$|The use of synergists is {{important}} in minimizing the amount of chemical insecticide required for insect control. Their use can contribute to reducing environmental contamination and preserving beneficial insects. To further investigate a promising alternative to the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO), we compared the synergistic effects of PBO and Piper aduncum L. essential oil (PAEO) when combined with several insecticides (cypermethrin, zeta-cypermethrin, permethrin, and <b>esfenvalerate)</b> on the larvae of Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith, 1797). Initially, we determined the lethal doses and concentrations (LD 50 and LC 50) for S. frugiperda larvae subjected to separate treatments with PAEO and with each commercial insecticide. Subsequently, in order to evaluate the synergistic effect, combinations of sublethal doses or sublethal concentrations of the essential oil (½ and ¼ of the LD 50 or LC 50, respectively) were prepared with sublethal doses or sublethal concentrations of the insecticides (below the LD 40 or LC 40). To confirm {{the evidence of the}} synergistic efficacy of the PAEO, the same reduced concentrations and doses of the insecticides that were previously used in combinations with the oil were also combined with PBO at a ratio of 10 : 1 (PBO:Insecticide). Through the relationship between the CL 50 and DL 50 of the insecticides taken separately and in their synergistic combinations with the PAEO and PBO, synergism factors (SF) were calculated for the various combinations. With residual contact, there was a significant enhancement of the commercial insecticides formulated with cypermethrin (SF = 73. 03), zeta-cypermethrin (SF = 16. 51), and permethrin (SF = 8. 46 - 17. 22) when combined with the PAEO; by contrast, with topical application there was a significant enhancement only for zeta-cypermethrin (SF = 0. 40 - 4. 26), permethrin (SF = 2. 10 - 4. 79), and <b>esfenvalerate</b> (SF = 3. 80) when combined with the essential oil. With the exception of <b>esfenvalerate,</b> the other synergistic combinations showed homogeneous responses for topical application and residual contact for at least one synergistic combination with PAEO. The significance of the SF values from combining PAEO with cypermethrin, zeta-cypermethrin, permethrin, and <b>esfenvalerate</b> insecticides may indicate that this essential oil is an effective alternative to PBO. 201...|$|E

40|$|Managed honey bee, Apis mellifera L., colonies are {{contracted}} to pollinate fruit and nut orchards improving crop quality and yield. Colonies placed in orchards are potentially exposed to pyrethroid insecticides used for broad-spectrum pest control. Pyrethroids {{have been reported}} to pose minimal risk to bees due to their low application rates in the field and putative repellent properties. This repellency is believed to alter foraging behavior with the benefit of preventing bees from encountering a lethal dose in the field. However, sub-lethal exposure to pyrethroids may adversely impact bee behavior potentially resulting in social dysfunction or disruption of foraging. This study quantified behaviors associated with sub-lethal exposure to orchard-applied pyrethroids including, lambdacyhalothrin, <b>esfenvalerate,</b> and permethrin, using video tracking software, Ethovision XT (Noldus Information Technologies). Bee locomotion, social interaction, and time spent near a food source were measured over a 24 -h period. Bees treated with a pyrethroid traveled 30 – 71 % less than control bees.
