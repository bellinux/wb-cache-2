40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{standard}} static model of labor supply and taxation {{to the case}} where {{people are able to}} legally avoid taxes through the use of itemized deductions. Tax <b>deductible</b> <b>expenditures</b> are treated as a Hicksian composite good with a price (for those who decide to itemize) proportional to one minus the marginal tax rate. Estimation of the commonly used linear labor supply model (extended to incorporate the additional composite good) on a cross-section of prime aged married men suggests that tax deductible consumption is an uncompensated substitute for leisure (and complement with labor). The impact of taxes through the relative price of <b>deductible</b> <b>expenditures</b> appears to be much stronger than through the net wage. Copyright 1992 by MIT Press. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{a new way}} {{of reducing}} the major individual tax expenditures: capping the total amount that tax expenditures as a whole can reduce each individual's tax burden. More specifically, we examine the effect of limiting the total value of the tax reduction resulting from tax expenditures to two percent of the individual's adjusted gross income. Each individual can benefit from the full range of tax expenditures but can receive tax reduction only up to 2 percent of his AGI. Simulations using the NBER TAXSIM model project that a 2 percent cap would raise $ 278 billion in 2011. The paper analyzes the revenue increases by AGI class. The 2 percent cap would also cause substantial simplification by inducing more than 35 million taxpayers to shift from itemizing their deductions to using the standard deduction. For any taxpayer for whom the 2 percent cap is binding, a cap would reduce the volume of wasteful spending and the associated deadweight loss. Even for those taxpayers for whom the cap is not binding but who are induced by the cap to shift from itemizing to using the standard deduction, the deadweight loss associated with <b>deductible</b> <b>expenditures</b> would be completely eliminated...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} conceptual interaction between section 23 M and section 31 of the Income Tax Act, 1962. Both sections limit tax <b>deductible</b> interest <b>expenditure</b> paid to non-resident related persons based on specific requirements. The dissertation establishes the ambit of each section {{by relying on}} an interpretive guide, which takes into account three aspects of interpretation. These three aspects are: the ordinary grammatical meaning of the words comprising each section; the contextual understanding of each section; {{and the purpose of}} each section. The dissertation determines that there is an overlap in the ambit of section 23 M and section 31 in respect of the taxpayer to which each section applies, interest as determined for purposes of the common law and the purpose of each section, being to prevent tax base erosion through excessive interest rate deductions. Despite the presence of an overlap, a taxpayer falling within the ambit of both sections is always limited to a deduction equal to the smaller answer yielded by section 23 M or section 31. However, in respect of the carry-forward in section 23 M(4) there is uncertainty as to the calculation of the carry-forward. The dissertation recommends an amendment to section 23 M(4) to clarify the calculation of the carry-forward amount. In the absence of a carry-forward, the dissertation determines that a possible interpretational solution may be to calculate the carry-forward with reference to actual interest expenditure and to subject any deduction in respect of an amount carried forward to section 31 in the year of assessment during which a deduction is claimed.

40|$|This study {{examines}} risk selection among nine health plans competing for 16, 182 employees of one large firm in 1989 : one conventional fee-for-service plan, one group-model {{health maintenance organization}} (HMO), and seven network and independent practice model HMOs. We develop and compare measures of risk using weights based on HMO and fee-for-service expenditure data, respectively. We use a multiequation statistical model to develop two sets of utilization and expenditure weights for enrollees in each plan. One set of weights, based on discharge abstracts and outpatient records from the large group-model HMO, measures how much each of the nine groups of employees and dependents would have spent, had they been enrolled in a stringently managed plan with no consumer cost sharing. The other set of weights, based on fee-for-service claims data, measures how much each group would have spent, had it been enrolled in an unmanaged health plan with significant coinsurance and <b>deductibles.</b> Predicted annual <b>expenditures</b> per enrollee exhibit a 23 % range from lowest (favorable selection) to highest (adverse selection) risk plans using the HMO weights and a 17 % range using fee-for-service weights. The fee-for-service plan and group-model HMO with large enrollments have risk mixes {{near the center of}} the spectrum. Smaller HMOs exhibit the extreme forms of both favorable and adverse selection. The statistical methods adopted in this study can be used to risk-adjust capitation payments to competing health plans. As mergers among HMOs and group purchasing arrangements among employers increase the average enrollment in each plan from each payor, however, risk differences among plans will be attenuated and the need to risk-adjust payments will be less severe.

40|$|SARS {{has issued}} a draft {{interpretation}} note dealing with the deductibility of expenditure and losses arising from embezzlement and theft by employees noting {{that it is not}} prepared to accept, as a general proposition, that embezzlement and theft by senior managers have become a risk which is inseparable from business. There is however another view that is in direct contradiction with SARS. An analysis of global fraud surveys reveal that senior employee fraud is on the increase. In South Africa, criminal cases against senior employees in the private and public sector indicate that their behaviour can lead to an expectation of theft, fraud or embezzlement at that level of employees. The tests developed by the courts for the deduction of expenditure or losses in terms of the general deduction formula require that such expenditure or loss be attached to the performance of a business operation bona fide performed for the purpose of earning income and will be <b>deductible</b> whether such <b>expenditure</b> or losses are necessary for its performance or attached to it by chance. It is submitted that the increase in fraud and behaviour of senior employees noted in the criminal courts have resulted in a change in the economic environment supporting the contention that theft, fraud or embezzlement are an inherent risk to business in South Africa. In addition, global precedence supports the view that senior employee defalcations are deductible but {{only to the extent that}} the perpetrator is not in a proprietor or shareholder role. SARS therefore appears to be turning a blind eye to the risk of theft, fraud or embezzlement by senior employees but there is sufficient evidence to support a taxpayer wishing to claim a deduction for such loss. In light of international precedence, National Treasury should enact legislation allowing a deduction or alternatively, SARS should align its view with such precedence...|$|R
40|$|Background: Evidence {{suggests}} that cost sharing (i. e.,copayments and <b>deductibles)</b> decreases health <b>expenditures</b> but also reduces essential care. Value-based insurance design (VBID) {{has been proposed}} to encourage essential care while controlling health expenditures. Our objective was to estimate the impact of broader diffusion of VBID on US health care benefits and costs. Methods and Findings: We used a published computer simulation of costs and life expectancy gains from US health care to estimate the impact of broader diffusion of VBID. Two scenarios were analyzed: (1) applying VBID solely to pharmacy benefits and (2) applying VBID to both pharmacy benefits {{and other health care}} services (e. g., devices). We assumed that cost sharing would be eliminated for high-value services ($ 300, 000 per life-year). All costs are provided in 2003 US dollars. Our simulation estimated that approximately 60 % of health expenditures in the US are spent on low-value services, 20 % are spent on intermediate-value services, and 20 % are spent on high-value services. Correspondingly, the vast majority (80 %) of health expenditures would have cost sharing that is impacted by VBID. With prevailing patterns of cost sharing, health care conferred 4. 70 life-years at a per-capita annual expenditure of US$ 5, 688. Broader diffusion of VBID to pharmaceuticals increased the benefit conferred by health care by 0. 03 to 0. 05 additional life-years, without increasing costs and without increasing out-of-pocket payments. Broader diffusion of VBID to other health care services could increase the benefit conferred by health care by 0. 24 to 0. 44 additional life-years, also without increasing costs and without increasing overall out-of-pocket payments. Among those without health insurance, using cost saving from VBID to subsidize insurance coverage would increase the benefit conferred by health care by 1. 21 life-years, a 31 % increase. Conclusion: Broader diffusion of VBID may amplify benefits from US health care without increasing health expenditures. Â© 2010 Braithwaite et al...|$|R
