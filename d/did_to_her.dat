5|$|Constantine met {{his future}} wife, Norma Agatha Cox, in 1921. She had little {{interest}} in cricket and, although their relationship developed during the early 1920s, she resented that he gave more time to cricket than he <b>did</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> However, the relationship lasted and she began to take more of an interest in his sporting achievements. They were married on 25 July 1927; their only child, Gloria, was born in April 1928.

She still has affections for Bartholomew after what he <b>did</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
500|$|On October 12, 1991, {{breaking}} news forced ABC News to interrupt regular Saturday morning programming again. Jennings {{was once again}} mindful of his audience, prefacing {{the coverage of the}} Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas with remarks for children. [...] "You may hear some not very nice language," [...] said Jennings. He noted that Thomas and his accuser, Anita Hill, [...] "have a very painful disagreement about some things the woman says the man <b>did</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> when they were working together...You can ask your parents to tell you more." [...] Jennings continued to produce special programs aimed at young viewers, anchoring Growing Up in the Age of AIDS, a frank, 90-minute-long discussion on AIDS in February 1992; and Prejudice: Answering Children's Questions, a forum on racism in April 1992.|$|E

He shows up in an Easter bunny costume while drunk. Jesus appears and points out that Catholicism and Judaism are very similar. He then tells Peter that he should treat people of different faiths as fairly as {{he wants to be}} treated. Peter and Lois apologize to each other, but are at a loss for what religion they should follow. After being asked this by Peter, Jesus answers [...] "Six of one, they're all complete crap." [...] and then Brian (offscreen) chimes in {{from the other side of}} the room, responding [...] "Thank you!" ...|$|E

500|$|After Gordon {{performs}} a satire {{of the government}} on his show, his home is raided and Evey is captured. She is imprisoned and tortured for information about V, with her only solace being a note written by actress Valerie Page, a former prisoner who was tortured and killed for her lesbianism. Evey is told she will be executed unless she reveals V's location. When she says she would rather die, she is inexplicably released, and then finds herself in V's home. It turns out that V {{was the one who}} had [...] "captured" [...] her at Gordon's home, and staged her imprisonment and torture to free her from her fears. The note was real, passed from Valerie to V when he was imprisoned. He also informs her that Deitrich had been executed when the Quran was found in his home. While Evey initially hates V for what he <b>did</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> she realises she has become a stronger person. She leaves him, promising to return before November 5.|$|E

500|$|The Dhoom series {{began with}} the release of Dhoom in 2004. The film became a {{commercial}} box office hit and received generally positive reviews from audiences, but not so much from critics. As a result, producer Yash Chopra announced plans for a sequel, titled Dhoom 2: Back in Action. John Abraham, portrayer of Kabir Sharma, the villain of the predecessor, was eliminated from the sequel because Chopra did not want Dhoom 2 to repeat the stories featured in its predecessor. Instead, Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai were introduced into the franchise as the sequel's main villains. Aishwarya Rai's character was summarised as Catwoman, a female fictional comic book femme fatale or anti-hero [...] Rai stated, [...] "All I can tell you is it would be nothing like anything you've seen me do before." [...] Producer Aditya Chopra told Rai to lose weight after she gained it for her role in 2004's Bride & Prejudice. Yash Chopra stated, [...] "But yes, the role does require Aishwarya to convey oodles of sensuality. She has asked {{for a couple of months}} to get into shape. We (at Yash Raj Films) are very clear about every character in every script and what's required of the actors. Before Dhoom, Esha Deol was specifically briefed about the look and the attitude she needed to cultivate. She readily agreed, and look at what Dhoom <b>did</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> career!" [...] Roshan also lost twelve pounds of weight at Aditya Chopra's request. With the exception of Abraham and Esha Deol, all of the other main actors in Dhoom were hired again for Dhoom 2.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{believe that}} the loss of body mass made it more {{difficult}} for her to support her voice, triggering the vocal strain that became apparent later in the decade (see vocal decline), while others believed the weight loss effected a newfound softness and femininity in her voice, as well as a greater confidence as a person and performer. Tito Gobbi said, [...] "Now she was not only supremely gifted both musically and dramatically—she was a beauty too. And her awareness of this invested with fresh magic every role she undertook. What it eventually <b>did</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> vocal and nervous stamina I am not prepared to say. I only assert that she blossomed into an artist unique in her generation and outstanding in the whole range of vocal history." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{possible}} {{instance of}} human sacrifice {{mentioned in the}} Bible is the sacrifice of Jephthah's daughter in Judges 11. Jephthah vows to sacrifice to God whatsoever comes to greet {{him at the door}} when he returns home if he is victorious. The vow is stated in the Book of Judges, 11:31: [...] "Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I will offer Him a burnt offering." [...] When he returns from battle, his virgin daughter runs out to greet him. She begs for, and is granted, [...] "two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends", after which [...] "he [...] <b>did</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as he had vowed." [...] According to some commentators of rabbinic literature, Jepthah's daughter was not sacrificed, but was forbidden to marry and remained a spinster her entire life, fulfilling the vow that she would be devoted to the Lord.|$|E
2500|$|Collins later {{admitted}} having suffered from bulimia after she quit {{smoking in the}} 1970s. [...] "I went straight from the cigarettes into an eating disorder", she told People magazine in 1992. [...] "I started throwing up. I didn't know anything about bulimia, certainly not {{that it is an}} addiction or that it would get worse. My feelings about myself, even though I had been able to give up smoking and lose 20 lbs., were of increasing despair." [...] She has written at length of her years of addiction to alcohol, the damage it <b>did</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> personal and musical life and how it contributed to her feelings of depression. Collins admits that although she tried other drugs in the 1960s, alcohol had always been her drug of first choice, just as it had been for her father. She entered a rehabilitation program in Pennsylvania in 1978 and has maintained her sobriety ever since, even through such traumatic events as the death of her only child, Clark, who committed suicide in 1992 at age 33 after a long bout with clinical depression and substance abuse. Since his death, she has also become an activist for suicide prevention.|$|E

2500|$|Gans {{described}} {{the concept of}} the town's connection to the child Alessa and the cult: [...] "It's a town of people trapped in dark dreams, and she inflicts onto the town what those people <b>did</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> body. That is, to me, the meaning of the darkness. The appearance of the town is corrupted in the way that her own flesh was wounded." [...] He furthers expands on Alessa's connection to the alternate reality seen in the film, saying that the alternate reality is [...] "in [...] head". [...] "It's interesting because the town itself mirrors this fractured psychology—different dimensions, different doubles of the same person." [...] In speaking about the creatures in Silent Hill, Gans said that [...] "these monsters are , with the poetic direction of the term: they are a little like the Japanese phantoms, i.e. residues of forgotten feelings as strong as hatred or [...]" [...] "The monsters in the game are not really monsters, but rather a mockery of human beings. The real monsters are the people, the cultists who tortured Alessa. When I approached the film, I knew {{that it was impossible to}} represent the monsters as simply beasts that jump on you." ...|$|E
