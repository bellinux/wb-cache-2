40|$|Insoluble {{constituents}} in 3104 alloy for beverage cans manufacturing play {{an important}} role in deep ironing process. This paper studies the effect of Fe content in the alloy on volume fraction of the constituents Al 6 (Fe, Mn) 3 and Al 12 (Fe, Mn) 3 Si and its influence on <b>ironing</b> <b>die</b> pickup. It is shown that with Fe content increase, the amount of these constituents rises that helps prevent tool galling. Trials made at a can plant showed less <b>ironing</b> <b>die</b> changeovers at bodymakers. The opti-mum Fe content for aluminum can production can be considered between 0. 47 % and 0. 53 % that corresponds to 2. 0 %- 2. 3 % of insoluble constituent volume fraction. Greater amounts than this cause problems with excessive constituent particle formation and earing; smaller amounts result in increased <b>ironing</b> <b>die</b> galling...|$|E

50|$|Hot bar sealers- have heated tooling kept at a {{constant}} temperature (also known as Direct Contact Thermal Sealing). They use one or more heated bars, <b>irons,</b> or <b>dies</b> which contact the material to heat the interface and form a bond. The bars, <b>irons</b> and <b>dies</b> have various configurations and can be covered with a release layer or utilize various slick interposer materials (i.e. Teflon films) to prevent sticking to the hot tooling.|$|R

Initial press releases cited Dengue fever as the cause of Irons' death; however, the autopsy report conducted by the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's office were negative for Dengue and other flavivirus.

50|$|The ore {{was crushed}} in a fifteen-stamp mill. The weight of stamps was seven {{hundred and fifty}} pounds, {{dropping}} seven inches 90 times per minute, and crushing through No. 5 round-punched screens. The duty per stamp was one and two-thirds tons per day. No rockbreakers or self-feeders were used, but {{the introduction of the}} same was contemplated. Steel shoes and <b>iron</b> <b>dies</b> were used. The sulphurets were saved on six Frue concentrators. The chlorination plant owned by the mine was formerly the property of the Merrifield Company. It contained one roasting furnace 75 x 10 ft inside measurement. It had a capacity of four tons per day; when sufficient sulphurets had accumulated, a run is made.
