40|$|Abstract—A comb-actuated {{torsional}} microscanner is devel-oped for high-resolution laser-scanning display systems. Typical torsional comb-drive scanners have fingers placed {{around the}} perimeter of the scanning mirror. In contrast, the structure in this paper uses cascaded frames, where the comb fingers are placed on an outer <b>drive</b> <b>frame,</b> and the motion is transferred to the inner mirror frame with a mechanical gain. The structure works only in resonant mode without requiring any offset in the comb fingers, keeping the silicon-on-insulator-based process quite simple. The design intent is to improve actuator efficiency by removing the high-drag fingers from the high-velocity scanning mirror. Placing them on the lower velocity <b>drive</b> <b>frame</b> reduces their contribution to the damping torque. Furthermore, placement on the <b>drive</b> <b>frame</b> allows an increase of the number of fingers and their capacity to impart torque. The microscanner exhibits a parametric response, and as such, the maximum deflection is found when actuated at twice its natural frequency. Analytical formulas are given for the coupled-mode equations and frame deflections. A simple formula is derived for the mechanical-gain factor. For a 1 -mm × 1. 5 -mm oblong scanning mirror, a 76 ◦ total optical scan angle is achieved at 21. 8 kHz with 196 -V peak-to-peak excitation voltages.

It is convenient to observe the effect of quadrature error and Coriolis offset by equivalent electrical model simulating. Three conditions are simulated and compared. The {{results indicate that the}} Coriolis offset reduces the amplitude of instantaneous displacement to a very small extent. Its effect can be neglected.

40|$|Abstract—With the {{ultimate}} goal of creating autonomous microrobots, we developed a five-mask process that combines two polysilicon structural layers with 50 - �-thick SOI structures and a backside substrate etch. The polysilicon layers provide three-dimensional (3 -D) hinged structures, high compliance structures, and electrical wiring. The SOI structural layer yields much stronger structures and large-force actuators. This process was developed {{as a part of a}} three-chip solution for a solar-powered 10 -mg silicon robot. Here, we describe the fabrication of this planarized-SOI, two-layer poly-Si process (henceforth called the SOI/poly process), basic modules in the design of robot legs in this process, and lastly, the results of fabricated robot legs. In designing the leg structures, we developed guidelines and test structures to provide a better understanding of the robot leg performance. These guidelines include understanding the relationship between the lateral etch depth to the actuator spacing and performing static friction tests of polysilicon flaps to more accurately model the frictional forces of the linkages. Last, we report on the performance of the robot legs and inchworm motors. On an 8 mm 3 mm robot, we have demonstrated a 1 degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot leg, 1 mm in length, which demonstrates up to 60 x of vertical leg force with an angular deflection of almost 30. A two-DOF robot leg, also 1 mm in length, operated with at least 90 of angular deflection, and each inchworm motor demonstrated a shuttle displacement of 400 � with speeds up to 6. 8 mm/s. In addition to robot legs, a bidirectional inchworm motor that produces equivalent forces in both directions was also fabricated in this SOI/poly process.

40|$|Local place, and our {{connection}} to it, {{has tended to}} lose ground within an atmosphere that continues to homogenize the particular and the individual {{in the context of}} the global. Increasingly we are concerned with environmental issues yet we persistently establish a divide between ourselves and the natural environment. Local natural places continue to diminish within the physical spaces of our lived environment. Time and space begin to distort and overlap so that one place seems much the same as another; becoming monomorphic and generic which, in a paradoxical way, denies us the capacity to have a particular place connection. These issues underlie many contemporary problems and have also acted as a potent driver for this research. This study addresses the issue of how the individual artist working with objects and subjects of place and affected by emergent aspatiality might reconcile a personal dis{{connection to}} local place - through a re-entering - and what effect this might have on aesthetic outcomes. The research aimed to elucidate a personal view of place through the forms and patterns revealed by the eye of the traveller in place looking through a scientific lens, to construct responses to smaller and larger forms of place by triggering an awareness by which the viewer may re-evaluate initial perceptions of local place through an idiosyncratic subjectifying and objectifying of subject, object and image. Five littoral zones within the place particular - the Townsville region were selected for analysis. This took the form of detailed sampling through the application of a dual process - the personal new eye aesthetic of a traveller (the idiosyncratic perspective), and the adoption of a scientific paradigm (the systematic method). The history of art and science and human placement has a parallel and intertwined relationship and evidence of this is gathered through the literature sourced. To equip this expedition this literature was assembled from two main avenues of enquiry - science and place. The scientific perspective was gained through readings encompassing the viewpoints of early and contemporary thought on mathematics, nature's dynamic structuring and patterning system. From the foundations laid by the revered theories of form and space of the Ancient Greeks to the entwined mathematics of biological form and structure espoused through the work of D'arcy Wentworth Thompson, the chaos theory of Mendelson, Mandelbrot, the expansive views of Lancelot Whyte, E O Wilson, Peter Stevens, Philip Ball, Ian Stewart, and Mario Livia are among the many paths viewed to gain an understanding of the filter applied to this research. An understanding of the notions of space and place, which again has a Western cultural birth in Ancient Greek thought, directs the reading through to the contemporary issues of identity crisis, sense of place and the displacement that is growing momentum. The literature of place connection has also taken a journey through the philosophies of phenomologists Husserl and Merleau-Ponty who brought the idea of place back to earth. The contemporary philosopher and humanistic geographer Edward Casey and Y-Fu Tuan are amongst the many scholars who have instigated current dialogues of place and our relationship to it. The literature opened up a simultaneous rich line of enquiry testing the extent of the preconditions of perception, that is, to what extent does the personal and often unrecognized or examined epistemological framework of the artist - the preconditioning - <b>drive,</b> <b>frame,</b> shape or limit the perception of local place and the ultimate art product? To what extent might the artist bring an objective understanding to a subjective art practice? The deliberate adoption of an alien filter - the scientific - through which to conduct this study of space and place meant that observation of the effect of the preconditioning and the signature that this new yet well defined paradigm might identify within the consequent art production became possible. Indeed, by appropriating the eye of the individual artist/traveller to see local place anew and aided by the interpretive tools of science - methodologies and analytical instrumentation - this individual experiment was undertaken in an effort not only to re-ground an arts practice but also to place the peripatetic individual in the context of location. It is within the juxtaposition of these two approaches that this research is conducted. As place offers a unique or characterizable collection or layering of magnitudes, patterns and sensitivities which can be analyzed formally, scientifically, mathematically or intuitively, aesthetically, personal placement and the patterns of place are thus the core subjects of this enquiry. In investigating the patterns and forms of the local littoral zones and identifying what is particular to these places within the Townsville region, place is encompassed, not merely as a positioning in space, but as personal, as reason, and as nucleus. Where place is designed to shape artistic output, it becomes the personal, the reason and director of the outcome; places of memory become the genius loci of individual being. Places of pattern, form, colour, rhythm and memory thus become the genius loci of the artist. Hence the process of collection and data analysis of this research was developed into a creative document through the presentation of a body of art work in a formal public exhibition and research documentation. This thesis recounts the journey of a local person renewing a contact with local place through the conscious appl[i]cation of a deliberatively objective methodology alongside the subjectively responsive one of the artist. Through this experimental journey equipped with the filter of the scientific paradigm, a heightened consciousness of each site's unique character was gained. Thereby, developing a dialogue with place, where subject, object, pattern, rhythm and form - the visible, the invisible and generally unnoticed - lead to a construction of place, which in tum established an informed connection and thus, addressed my personal aspatiality. The resultant journey documents the data collected, the idiosyncratic artistic response and their coalescence which elicit directions for future research, through the promotion of contact with local natural places and the application of determining filters...|$|E

Thereafter methods for exploiting the error-correcting capabilities of the LDPCA code in DVC are investigated. The proposed frame interpolation includes a symmetric flow constraint to the standard forward-backward frame interpolation scheme, which improves quality and handling of large motion. The three flows are combined in one solution. The proposed frame interpolation method consistently outperforms an overlapped block motion compensation scheme and a previous TV-L 1 optical flow frame interpolation method with an average PSNR improvement of 1. 3 dB and 2. 3 dB respectively. For a GOP size of 2, an average bitrate saving of more than 40 % is achieved compared to DISCOVER on Wyner-Ziv frames. In addition we also exploit and investigate the internal error-correcting capabilities of the LDPCA code {{in order to make it}} more robust to errors. We investigate how to achieve this goal by only modifying the decoding. One of approaches is to use bit flipping; alternatively one can modify the parity check matrix of the LDPCA.
