40|$|The {{performances}} of five automated microbial identification systems, relative {{to that of}} a reference <b>identification</b> system, <b>for</b> their ability to accurately and repeatedly identify six common food-borne pathogens were assessed. The systems assessed were the MicroLog system (Biolog Inc., Hayward, Calif.), the Microbial Identification System (MIS; MIDI Inc., Newark, Del.), the VITEK system (bioMérieux Vitek, Hazelwood, Mo.), the MicroScan WalkAway 40 system (Dade-MicroScan International, West Sacramento, Calif.), and the Replianalyzer system (Oxoid Inc., Nepean, Ontario, Canada). The sensitivities and specificities of these systems <b>for</b> the <b>identification</b> of food-borne isolates of Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli were determined with 40 reference positive isolates and 40 reference negative isolates for each pathogen. The sensitivities of these systems <b>for</b> the <b>identification</b> of these pathogens ranged from 42. 5 to 100 %, and the specificities of these systems <b>for</b> the <b>identification</b> of these pathogens ranged from 32. 5 to 100 %. Some of the systems had difficulty correctly identifying the reference isolates when the results were compared to those from the reference identification tests. The sensitivity of MIS <b>for</b> the <b>identification</b> of S. aureus, B. cereus, E. coli, and C. jejuni, for example, ranged from 47. 5 to 72. 5 %. The sensitivity of the Microlog system <b>for</b> the <b>identification</b> of E. coli was 72. 5 %, and the sensitivity of the VITEK system <b>for</b> the <b>identification</b> of B. cereus was 42. 5 %. The specificities of four of the five systems <b>for</b> the <b>identification</b> of all of the species tested with the available databases were {{greater than or equal to}} 97. 5 %; the exception was MIS <b>for</b> the <b>identification</b> of C. jejuni, which displayed a specificity of 32. 5 % when it was tested with reference negative isolates including Campylobacter coli and other Campylobacter species. All systems had > 80 % sensitivities <b>for</b> the <b>identification</b> of Salmonella species and Listeria species at the genus level. The repeatability of these systems <b>for</b> the <b>identification</b> of test isolates ranged from 30 to 100 %.

Animals were procured from private owners in a systematic procedure, but to ensure the continuity of Finnhorse breeding, neither stallions nor any nursing, pregnant or studbook-approved mares were enrolled to be eligible for military procurement. All procured horses officially remained their private owners' property, were marked <b>for</b> <b>identification</b> and as necessary, were returned or reported dead.

30|$|The {{identification}} of the bacteria involved in degradation was proceeded mainly by 16 S rRNA sequencing <b>for</b> strain <b>identifications,</b> but one isolate was also characterized by GC-FAME analysis as well. The 16 S rRNA is approx 1500  bp region of genomic region of bacteria and considered as genetic signature <b>for</b> the <b>identification</b> of the bacteria. A number of studies were conducted based on this technique, and it was considered that 16 S region is conserved {{during the course of}} evolution among bacterial linage. Therefore, it helps microbiologists and pathologists in the characterization of new strain isolated from various sources. Similarly, GC-FAME-based identification was also considered rapid and reliable technique <b>for</b> the <b>identification</b> of microorganisms based on the pattern of cellular fatty acid in bacteria, which is unique signature and aids in their identification and classification. The only commercial available database <b>for</b> the <b>identification</b> by fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis is Sherlock microbial identification system (MIS) developed by Microbial ID, Inc (MIDI).
