5|$|After {{returning}} to Earth, Van den Berg {{continued to work}} on crystal growth experiments at EG in California and he became the <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> section of materials science. At a later time he moved to Florida to become a chief scientist at the Constellation Technology Corporation. At age 72, he continued to work up to 40 hours a week and grow crystals, a process he compares to gardening. The crystals he grows (Mercuric Iodide crystals) are used to make precision detectors for nuclear radiation. These detectors are used in medical applications, by the defense industry and the International Atomic Energy Agency.|$|E

5|$|The Maya at Chaktumal fed false {{information}} to the Spanish, and Montejo {{was unable to find}} d'Avila and link up with him. D'Avila returned overland to Xelha, and transferred the fledgling Spanish colony to nearby Xamanha, modern Playa del Carmen, which Montejo considered to be a better port. After waiting for d'Avila without result, Montejo sailed south as far as the Ulúa River in Honduras before turning around and heading back up the coast to finally meet up with his lieutenant at Xamanha. Late in 1528, Montejo left d'Avila to oversee Xamanha and sailed north to loop around the Yucatán Peninsula and <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Spanish colony of New Spain in central Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The three destroyers and 16 {{small boats}} left Falmouth, Cornwall, at 14:00 on 26 March 1942. They formed into {{a convoy of}} three lanes, with the destroyers in the middle. On arrival at St Nazaire the {{portside}} MLs were to <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Old Mole to disembark their Commandos, while the starboard lane would make for the old entrance to the basin to disembark theirs.

5|$|A mass murder–suicide occurs among {{a team of}} geophysicists at an outpost in Icy Cape, Alaska. FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> outpost, {{accompanied}} by physician Dr. Hodge (Xander Berkeley); toxicologist Dr. Da Silva (Felicity Huffman); geologist Dr. Murphy (Steve Hytner) and Bear (Jeff Kober), their pilot. With the scientists' bodies the group finds a dog, who attacks Mulder and Bear. Scully notices black nodules on its skin, and suspects {{that it may be}} infected with bubonic plague; she also notices movement beneath its skin. Although Bear (who was bitten by the dog) becomes ill and develops similar nodules on his body, autopsies reveal no such nodules on the bodies of the scientists.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Graf Spees Arado {{floatplane}} {{located the}} merchant ship Doric Star: Langsdorff fired a shot across her bow {{to stop the}} ship. Doric Star was able to send out a distress signal before she was sunk, which prompted Harwood to take his three cruisers {{to the mouth of}} the River Plate, which he estimated would be Langsdorff's next target. On the night of 5 December, Admiral Graf Spee sank the steamer Tairoa. The next day, she met with Altmark and transferred 140 prisoners from Doric Star and Tairoa. Admiral Graf Spee encountered her last victim on the evening of 7 December: the freighter Streonshalh. The prize crew recovered secret documents containing shipping route information. Based on that information, Langsdorff decided to <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> seas off Montevideo. On 12 December, the ship's Arado 196 broke down and could not be repaired, depriving Graf Spee of her aerial reconnaissance. The ship's disguise was removed, so it would not hinder the ship in battle.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} makes {{their way through}} the damaged ship, they swim through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two xenomorphs. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the xenomorph so the others can escape. After Wren betrays the group, Call is {{revealed}} to be an auton, an improved version of a human created by synthetics. Using her ability to interface with the Aurigas systems, Call sets it {{on a collision course with}} Earth, hoping to destroy the xenomorphs in the crash. She cuts off Wren's escape route and directs the xenomorphs towards him. Ripley 8 is captured by a xenomorph, while the others <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Betty. Wren, who is already aboard, shoots Purvis, takes Call hostage and demands that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis attacks Wren and forces Wren's head to his chest just as the xenomorph embryo he is carrying bursts through his ribcage, causing it to go through Wren's head too, killing them both. The survivors shoot and kill the juvenile xenomorph.|$|E

As the sea creatures attack the diver, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown and <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> beach. Patrick inadvertently loses the Bag of Winds while attempting to use it, but David Hasselhoff appears and offers them a ride; Dennis catches up to them but is knocked by a catamaran back into the sea. Hasselhoff opens up his rocket launching pecs to shoot SpongeBob and Patrick back to Bikini Bottom with the crown.|$|E
5|$|Half of Harris's {{credited}} kills {{were achieved}} in October, coinciding with Japanese planners' final attempt at provoking a decisive {{battle with the}} American fleet. On October 1, 1944, while still anchored at Ulithi, Intrepid was made Admiral Bogan's flagship. The carrier disembarked from harbor on October 7 to <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> waters southeast of Okinawa. It {{was scheduled to be}} part of strikes on Okinawa, the Ryukyus and Luzon leading up to a planned invasion of Leyte. These strikes began on October 10, targeting Okinawan airfields including Naha, Yontan and Ie Shima, as well as nearby shipping. Anti-aircraft fire ranged from meager to intense with flak worsening throughout the day. But, regardless of strike time, or target, there was virtually no aerial opposition encountered.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, {{before the}} onset of {{fighting}} in Puerto Rico, Juan Alonso Zayas, born in San Juan, was a second lieutenant in the Spanish Army when he received orders to <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Philippines to take command of the 2nd Expeditionary Battalion stationed in Baler. He arrived in Manila, the capital, in May 1897. There he took a vessel and headed for Baler, on the island of Luzon. The distance between Manila and Baler is 62 miles (100km); if traveled through the jungles and badly built roads, the actual distance was 144 miles (230km). At that time a system of communication between Manila and Baler was almost non-existent. The only way Baler received news from Manila was by way of vessels. The Spanish colonial government was under constant attack from local Filipino groups who wanted independence. Zayas's mission was to fortify Baler against any possible attack. Among his plans for the defense of Baler was to convert the local church of San Luis de Tolosa into a fort.|$|E

5|$|Nilin reluctantly {{goes along}} with Edge's next plan: to remix the CEO of Memorize, Scylla Cartier-Wells, to make her see the harm her company's {{technology}} is causing. Nilin makes her way into Scylla's office and enters her mind, remixing {{the memory of a}} car crash which left her with a bitter taste against the world. As she changes the memory to make Scylla a more compassionate person, Nilin discovers that she is Scylla's daughter. Nilin is then told by Edge to <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Bastille basements to save Bad Request, who has been taken captive. She finds Bad Request, but discovers that his memory has been fully wiped. It is revealed that Memorize scientist Doctor Quaid means to control the Leapers through their Sensens and thus breed a private army for Memorize. However, Johnny Greenteeth, a former co-worker of Quaid's who was experimented on and turned into a Leaper, kills Quaid and prepares to self-destruct the Bastille. Bad Request helps Nilin take down Johnny at the cost of his life and Nilin escapes the destroyed facility.|$|E
5|$|Ottoman scouts {{reported}} to Suleiman {{that there were}} untouched villages near Vaslui, and the Ottomans headed for that region. The winter {{made it difficult to}} set camp, which forced the Ottomans to move quickly and <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Moldavian capital, Suceava. To reach Vaslui, where the Moldavian army had its main camp, they needed to cross Podul Înalt over the Bârlad River. The bridge was made of wood and not suitable for heavy transportation of troops. Stephen chose that area for the battle – the same location where his father, Bogdan II, had defeated the Poles in 1450; and where he, at an age of 17, had fought side-by-side with Vlad 'the Impaler'. The area was ideal for the defenders: the valley was a semi-oval surrounded on all sides by hills covered by forest. Inside the valley, the terrain was marshy, which restricted troop movement. Suleiman had full confidence in his troops and made few efforts to scout the area.|$|E

However, Akane's illness is more severe than expected, and she is scheduled for surgery {{on the morning of the}} prefectural final against Ryuō. Before the game begins, Ko tells Aoba he loves her more than anyone, but in such a way she thinks he is lying until after Seishu wins in extra innings, clinching a Koshien berth.
