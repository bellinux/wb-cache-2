5|$|After Sebastian Vettel's {{surprise}} victory {{two weeks}} prior in Malaysia, {{eyes were on}} Ferrari whether {{they would be able}} to continue their good race pace in China and challenge the Mercedes for the win. As lower track temperatures were expected for the race, a serious competitiveness of Ferrari was cast into doubt, as they had benefited from lower tyre degradation in the heat of Malaysia. All ten teams taking part in the championship participated in the race, with Marussia hoping to <b>finally</b> <b>be</b> able to run both cars continually, after Will Stevens had failed to start in Malaysia.|$|E

5|$|Actual {{purification}} of {{the waste}} water from the Brussels-Capital Region was not completed until the 21st century, when two purification stations were built. The south station treats refuse water from 360,000 inhabitants, which is about {{one third of the}} polluted water, and lies on the border of Anderlecht and Forest. The north station, completed in March 2007, is located near the border of the Brussels-Capital Region, between the Senne and the Charleroi-Willebroek Canal, near Buda Bridge. A portion of the cost was footed by the Flemish Government, as 7 of the adjacent municipalities lie within the Flemish Region. This station is capable of treating the water of 1,100,000 inhabitants and should <b>finally</b> <b>be</b> capable of fully purifying the Senne, which had long caused much of the pollution of the Scheldt river.|$|E

Fiver {{and the rest of the}} group work together to rescue Bigwig from a snare, then continue on their journey, along with a rabbit from the new warren called Strawberry, who asks to join them after his doe is killed in a snare.|$|E
5|$|However, in 2007, {{construction}} resumed on the Second Avenue Subway, {{and as part}} of the line's construction, the BMT side of {{the station}} would <b>finally</b> <b>be</b> used. The orange wall was removed and replaced by a temporary barrier. Beige-white wall tiles were installed on the station walls adjacent to the tracks. The never-opened entrance at Third Avenue was redesigned with multiple elevators, and the station's false ceiling was removed. Before Second Avenue Subway service began operating, the temporary walls were removed, revealing the BMT side of the station. On January 1, 2017, {{the first phase of the}} Second Avenue Subway opened, with Q trains, and limited rush hour N trains serving the BMT half of the station. Ridership has increased at the station with the opening of the Third Avenue exit and the introduction of Q service.

5|$|The eze Nri was {{the title}} of the ruler of Nri with ritual and mystic (but not military) power. He was a ritual figure rather than a king in the {{traditional}} sense. The eze Nri was chosen after an interregnum period while the electors waited for supernatural powers to manifest in the new eze Nri. He was installed after a symbolic journey to Aguleri on the Anambra River. The authorities must be notified prior to commencement of this journey to obtain the Ududu-eze,the royal scepter.

5|$|The ice-cutting {{involved}} several {{stages and}} was typically {{carried out at}} night, when the ice was thickest. First the surface would be cleaned of snow with scrapers, {{the depth of the}} ice tested for suitability, then the surface would be marked out with cutters to produce the lines of the future ice blocks. The size of the blocks varied according to the destination, the largest being for the furthest locations, the smallest destined for the American east coast itself and being only 22inches (0.56 m) square. The blocks could <b>finally</b> <b>be</b> cut out of the ice and floated to the shore. The speed of the operation might depend on the likelihood of warmer weather impacting on the ice. In both New England and Norway, harvesting occurred during an otherwise quiet season, providing valuable local employment.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been a steady {{increase}} in the energy output of the Sun. When the Sun first became a main sequence star, it radiated only 70% of the current luminosity. The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, rising by 1% every 110 million years. Likewise, in three billion years the Sun {{is expected to be}} 33% more luminous. The hydrogen fuel at the core will <b>finally</b> <b>be</b> exhausted in five billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity reaches 121% above the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it will pass through the subgiant stage and evolve into a red giant.|$|E
5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) {{all the way to}} the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can <b>finally</b> <b>be</b> distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E
