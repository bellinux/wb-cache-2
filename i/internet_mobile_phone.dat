40|$|Results from a {{national}} representative telephone survey of Americans in 2000 show that <b>Internet</b> and <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> usage was very similar, and that several digital divides exist with respect to both <b>Internet</b> and <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> usage. The study identifies and analyzes three kinds of digital divides for both the <b>Internet</b> and <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> [...] users/nonuser, veteran/recent, and continuing/dropout [...] and similarities and differences among those digital divides based on demographic variables. The gap between Internet users and nonusers is associated with income and age, but no longer with gender and race, once other variables are controlled. The gap between <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> users and nonusers is associated with income, work status, and marital status. The veteran/recent Internet gap is predicted by income, age, education, phone user, membership in community religious organizations, having children, and gender; for <b>mobile</b> <b>phones,</b> age, work status and marital status are predictors. The gap between continuing and dropout users is predicted by education for Internet usage and income for <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> usage. Finally, cross-categorization of <b>Internet</b> and <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> usage/nonusage is distinguished (significantly though weakly) primarily by income and education. Thus, there are several digital divides, each predicted by somewhat different variables; and while <b>Internet</b> and <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> usage levels in 2000 were about the same, their users overlap but do not constitute completely equivalent populations.

50|$|A spatial network (sometimes also {{geometric}} graph) is a graph {{in which}} the vertices or edges are spatial elements associated with geometric objects, i.e. the nodes are located in a space equipped with a certain metric. The simplest mathematical realization is a lattice or a random geometric graph, where nodes are distributed uniformly at random over a two-dimensional plane; a pair of nodes are connected if the Euclidean distance is smaller than a given neighborhood radius. Transportation and mobility networks, <b>Internet,</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> networks, power grids, social and contact networks and neural networks are all examples where the underlying space is relevant and where the graph's topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure, resilience {{and the evolution of}} spatial networks is crucial for many different fields ranging from urbanism to epidemiology.|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates young people's {{use of the}} <b>Internet</b> and <b>mobile</b> <b>phones,</b> {{and focuses}} {{especially}} on associations between use of these technologies for communication purposes and social anxiety. First, two surveys are reported which examine the broad characteristics of young people’s <b>Internet</b> and <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> use. The first of these was conducted on paper and provides a general description of these activities amongst {{young people in the}} Teesside area of England. The second survey was conducted online with a population from a wider area and supports the paper survey. Together, the surveys indicate {{that there may be a}} small bias towards male use of and competence with the Internet. There may also be a small bias towards female use of <b>mobile</b> <b>phones.</b> Results concerning non-use of the <b>Internet</b> and <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> are also discussed. Reports of the surveys are followed by descriptions of a questionnaire study, also conducted in the Teesside area of England, which indicates that associations between the psychological conditions social anxiety and social phobia and use of the <b>Internet</b> and <b>mobile</b> <b>phones,</b> generally, and for communication purposes, are minimal. (However, small but significant associations are discussed). Finally, was conducted using Grounded Theory, is described. This reveals that that control over social interactions, sometimes in relation to transient, or situational, social anxiety, might be one important reason why young people like to use text-based <b>Internet</b> and <b>mobile</b> <b>phone</b> communication media to interact. It is concluded that whilst social anxiety as a psychological characteristic or trait may not be strongly related to young people s use of the <b>Internet</b> and <b>mobile</b> <b>phones</b> for communication purposes, young people may nevertheless sometimes use these technologies to manage situational social anxiety.

40|$|Background {{and aims}} This study {{focuses on the}} use of popular {{information}} and communication technologies (ICTs) by adolescents: the <b>Internet,</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>phones,</b> and video games. The relationship of ICT use and experiential avoidance (EA), a construct that has emerged as underlying and transdiagnostic {{to a wide variety of}} psychological problems, including behavioral addictions, is examined. EA refers to a self-regulatory strategy involving efforts to control or escape from negative stimuli such as thoughts, feelings, or sensations that generate strong distress. This strategy, which may be adaptive in the short term, is problematic if it becomes an inflexible pattern. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore whether EA patterns were associated with addictive or problematic use of ICT in adolescents. Methods A total of 317 students of the Spanish southeast between 12 and 18 years old were recruited to complete a questionnaire that included questions about general use of each ICTs, an experiential avoidance questionnaire, a brief inventory of the Big Five personality traits, and specific questionnaires on problematic use of the <b>Internet,</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>phones,</b> and video games. Results Correlation analysis and linear regression showed that EA largely explained results regarding the addictive use of the <b>Internet,</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>phones,</b> and video games, but not in the same way. As regards gender, boys showed a more problematic use of video games than girls. Concerning personality factors, conscientiousness was related to all addictive behaviors. Discussion and conclusions We conclude that EA is an important construct that should be considered in future models that attempt to explain addictive behaviors...|$|R
