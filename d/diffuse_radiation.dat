25|$|Diffuse sky {{radiation}} is solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface {{after having been}} scattered from the direct solar beam by molecules or suspensoids in the atmosphere. It is also called skylight, diffuse skylight, or {{sky radiation}} and {{is the reason for}} changes in the color of the sky. Of the total light removed from the direct solar beam by scattering in the atmosphere (approximately 25% of the incident radiation when the sun is high in the sky, depending on the amount of dust and haze in the atmosphere), about two-thirds ultimately reaches the earth as diffuse sky radiation. When the sun is at the zenith in a cloudless sky, with 1361W/m2 above the atmosphere, direct sunlight is about 1050W/m2, and total insolation about 1120W/m2. This implies that under these conditions the <b>diffuse</b> <b>radiation</b> is only about 70W/m2 out of the original 1361W/m2.|$|E

The comparison is carried out at eight meteorological stations in China focusing on the monthly average daily <b>diffuse</b> solar <b>radiation.</b> Based on statistical error tests, the results show that the Non-H method that includes other readily available meteorological elements gives better estimates.

50|$|The {{infrared}} {{atmospheric window}} is the overall dynamic {{property of the}} earth's atmosphere, {{taken as a whole}} at each place and occasion of interest, that lets some infrared radiation from the cloud tops and land-sea surface pass directly to space without intermediate absorption and re-emission, and thus without heating the atmosphere. It cannot be defined simply as a part or set of parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, because the spectral composition of window radiation varies greatly with varying local environmental conditions, such as water vapour content and land-sea surface temperature, and because few or no parts of the spectrum are simply not absorbed at all, and because some of the <b>diffuse</b> <b>radiation</b> is passing nearly vertically upwards and some is passing nearly horizontally.
