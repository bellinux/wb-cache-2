25|$|All large {{businesses}} incur {{administrative costs}} {{in the process of}} delivering revenue collected from customers to the suppliers of the goods or services being purchased. Taxation is no different; the resource collected from the public through taxation is always greater than the amount which can be used by the government. The difference is called the compliance cost and includes (for example) the labour cost and other expenses incurred in complying with tax laws and rules. The collection of a tax in order to spend it on a specified purpose, for example collecting a tax on alcohol to pay directly for alcoholism-rehabilitation centres, is called <b>hypothecation.</b> Finance ministers often dislike this practice, since it reduces their freedom of action. Some economic theorists regard <b>hypothecation</b> as intellectually dishonest since, in reality, money is fungible. Furthermore, it often happens that taxes or excises initially levied to fund some specific government programs are then later diverted to the government general fund. In some cases, such taxes are collected in fundamentally inefficient ways, for example, though highway tolls.|$|E
2500|$|A {{maritime}} lien is a lien on a vessel, given {{to secure the}} claim of a creditor who provided maritime services to the vessel or who suffered an injury from the vessel's use. [...] Maritime liens are {{sometimes referred to as}} tacit <b>hypothecation.</b> [...] Maritime liens have little in common with other liens under the laws of most jurisdictions.|$|E
2500|$|Excises (or {{exemptions}} from them) {{are also}} used to modify consumption patterns of a certain area (social engineering). For example, a high excise is used to discourage alcohol consumption, relative to other goods. This may be combined with <b>hypothecation</b> if the proceeds are then {{used to pay for}} the costs of treating illness caused by alcohol abuse. Similar taxes may exist on tobacco, pornography, etc., and they may be collectively referred to as [...] "sin taxes". A carbon tax is a tax on the consumption of carbon-based non-renewable fuels, such as petrol, diesel-fuel, jet fuels, and natural gas. The object is to reduce the release of carbon into the atmosphere. In the United Kingdom, vehicle excise duty is an annual tax on vehicle ownership.|$|E
50|$|Bowen was {{appointed}} {{president at the}} close of May, 1841, and continued in that office till the annual election in October, 1842. During {{the first six months of}} that period, the affairs of the Company continued to be prosperous in all four divisions. The Eastern division, after a considerable delay for the arrival of iron, was opened to the public from Piermont to Goshen, in the month of September. The work under the contracts on the Susquehanna and Western divisions was rapidly advanced. That on the Delaware division was delayed by an injunction obtained by the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company.Under the concurrent influence, however, of the political faction who were opposed to State Loans and to all public works, and of a depressed state of commercial affairs, the sale of the State stock became increasingly difficult, and the price receded from ninety-two per cent, in June, to eighty-two, in December. To avoid so heavy a discount, and prevent a further decline by throwing it on the market, a large amount of it was hypothecated as security for temporary loans. At length, in the course of the winter, the price fell below the rates at which <b>hypothecations</b> had been made, and sales became necessary.|$|R
40|$|The {{authorised}} Edition of the Statute Law of the Colony, {{covering the}} period 1652 - 1895, revised by Mr. Advocate Tennant and myself in 1895, having Been for some considerable {{time out of}} print and unobtainable, the opportunity has been deemed favourable for issuing a reprint revised {{to the end of}} the Session of 1905. The text of the Ordinances and Acts has been carefully read; all enactments repealed by legislation subsequent to 1895 have been omitted, explanatory footnotes having been added where necessary; and all Acts re-enacted have been re-printed. The arrangement, under which the paging of the Sessional Acts passed after 1895 was made continuous, has not been disturbed, so that the use of this Edition in the Courts will not create confusion as would be the case if the paging differed. To quote an example. The Charter of. Justice will be found printed on pages 93 - 108 in both Editions. The Act 21 of 1864 amending it occupies pages 948 - 955 of the 1895 Edition, but in view of its repeal is not printed in this Edition, a note to that effect appearing' on page 947, the number of the page (956) following, corresponding with the 1895 Edition. This Edition consists of four volumes, the first three containing the text of the Acts, and the last a full Chronological Table with an entirely new Index completed {{to the end of the}} Session of 1905.

6000|$|In the Illinois House of Representatives, December 4, 1840, House in Committee of the Whole on {{the bill}} {{providing}} for payment of interest on the State debt,--Mr. Lincoln moved to strike out the body and amendments of the bill, and insert in lieu thereof an amendment which in substance was that the governor be authorized to issue bonds for the payment of the interest; that these be called [...] "interest bonds"; that the taxes accruing on Congress lands as they become taxable be irrevocably set aside and devoted as a fund to the payment of the interest bonds. Mr. Lincoln went into the reasons which appeared to him to render this plan preferable to that of hypothecating the State bonds. By this course we could get along till the next meeting of the Legislature, which was of great importance. To the objection which might be urged that these interest bonds could not be cashed, he replied that if our other bonds could, much more could these, which offered a perfect security, a fund being irrevocably set aside {{to provide for their}} redemption. To another objection, that we should be paying compound interest, he would reply that the rapid growth and increase of our resources was in so great a ratio as to outstrip the difficulty; that his object was to do the best that could be done in the present emergency. All agreed that the faith of the State must be preserved; this plan appeared to him preferable to a <b>hypothecation</b> of bonds, which would have to be redeemed and the interest paid. How this was to be done, he could not see; therefore he had, after turning the matter over in every way, devised this measure, which would carry us on till the next Legislature.|$|E
5000|$|Secondly, we {{differentiate}} between wide and narrow <b>hypothecation.</b> When the tax revenues finance the entire public service {{such as the}} health care, we talk about wide <b>hypothecation.</b> Narrow <b>hypothecation</b> means that only a specific area such as nursery education is funded.|$|E

5000|$|The most {{supported}} type is {{a combination}} of strong and narrow <b>hypothecation.</b> In this case, the <b>hypothecation</b> can serve as a beneficial link between demand and supply. An example can be financing the roads in the U.S. by the gasoline tax.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} form of <b>hypothecation</b> is a repo transaction: the {{creditor}} gives a loan to the debtor and receives in return the possession (not the ownership) of a financial asset until the maturity of the loan.A reverse repo is a <b>hypothecation</b> 'in the reverse direction': creditor and debtor swap roles.|$|E
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of <b>hypothecation</b> is to {{mitigate}} the creditor's credit risk. If the debtor cannot pay, the creditor possesses the collateral and therefore can claim its ownership, sell it and thus compensate the lacking cash inflows. In a default of the obligor without previous <b>hypothecation,</b> the creditor cannot be sure that it can seize sufficient assets of the debtor. Because <b>hypothecation</b> {{makes it easier to}} get the debt and potentially decreases its price; the debtor wants to hypothecate as much debt as possible - but the isolation of 'good assets' for the collateral worsens the quality {{of the rest of the}} debtor's balance sheet and thus its credit quality.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypothecation</b> is the {{practice}} where (usually through {{a letter of}} <b>hypothecation)</b> a debtor pledges collateral to secure a debt or as a condition precedent to the debt, or a third party pledges collateral for the debtor. A common example occurs when a debtor enters into a mortgage agreement, in which the debtor's house becomes collateral until the mortgage loan is paid off.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hypothecation,</b> or [...] "trust receipts" [...] are {{relatively}} uncommon forms of security interest whereby {{the underlying assets}} are pledged, not by delivery of the assets as in a conventional pledge, but by delivery of a document or other evidence of title. <b>Hypothecation</b> is usually seen in relation to bottomry (cf. bills of lading), whereby the bill of lading is endorsed by the secured party, who, unless the security is redeemed, can claim the property by delivery of the bill.|$|E
50|$|In tax circles, to {{restrict}} a tax payment {{from a particular}} purpose, or to designate a tax payment for a particular purpose, is called <b>hypothecation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{health care}} system is also often {{supported}} of the taxes on tobacco as smoking is considered as a serious threat. For example, in Egypt, the revenue earned from these taxes is used to help to cover the health insurance and provide prevention and rehabilitation for students. Besides the United Kingdom and Egypt, <b>hypothecation</b> helps to finance health care in many countries including Finland, the Republic of Korea, Portugal, Thailand or Belgium. (<b>Hypothecation</b> of tax revenue for health Ole Doetinchem, World Health Report (2010) Background Paper, 51) ...|$|E
50|$|Generally, a {{cash credit}} account is secured by a charge {{on the current}} assets (inventory) of the organization. The kind of charge created can be either pledge or <b>hypothecation.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the more}} general {{category}} of <b>hypothecation,</b> there are already well-established precedents: they include the gasoline tax in the United States, which {{is dedicated to the}} funding of transportation infrastructure.|$|E
5000|$|Accountability {{and trust}} - Hypothecated taxes may help when the {{government}} is not trusted. With <b>hypothecation,</b> it will have to follow a plan made in advance and will have no flexibility.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, the Mercatus Center {{pointed out}} the {{negative}} effects that dedicating tax revenues to specific expenditures can have on the policymakers. In their report they stated that <b>hypothecation</b> {{can be used to}} mask the increases in total government spending.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem of}} ambiguousness of <b>hypothecation</b> occurs in many {{countries}} all over the world. As mentioned before, revenues of hypothecated taxes are often used to finance health care or education because in these sectors the aggregate preference can be easily revealed.|$|E
50|$|The {{detailed}} {{practice and}} rules regulating <b>hypothecation</b> {{vary depending on}} context and on the jurisdiction where it takes place. In the US, the legal right for the creditor to take ownership of the collateral if the debtor defaults is classified as a lien.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} between a deed and an agreement is that the deed is generally signed by only one person / party. Examples of a deed are deeds of <b>hypothecation</b> for creating charge on movable properties in favour of the banks/financial institutions etc.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} hypothecated taxes goes way back. One {{of the first}} {{examples}} of earmarking was ‘Ship Money’ or in other words the tax paid by English seaports used to finance the Royal Navy. Later, in the 20th century, the hypothecated tax became to be discussed among the politicians in the United Kingdom. For example, the Vehicle Excise Duty from 1920 when earned revenues {{were used for the}} construction and maintenance of the roads, [...] assigning 1p on the income tax directly to education in 1992 or giving £300 million per year from the revenues from taxes on the tobacco industry to help the fight against smoking-related diseases since 1999. Nowadays, earmarking of taxes is mainly connected to the health care system, education or the upkeep of the roads.==Types of hypothecated tax== The hypothecated tax can be divided into three groups based on the main characteristics. The emphasis can be put on the final use of the revenues, on the vastness of the area financed from the money earned or on the type of the tax. Each group then has two subsections. In the first case, we distinguish between strong and weak <b>hypothecation.</b> Strong <b>hypothecation</b> means that the revenues from the tax go only to financing the particular service and the service is financed only through the revenues from this tax. Strong <b>hypothecation</b> is thought to be appropriate for pure public goods where voters must reveal their consumption preferences. If {{at least one of the}} two conditions is not met, we say that the <b>hypothecation</b> is weak. [...] This distinction is the most common as many of the arguments for and against hypothecated tax are based on it.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main ideas on which {{benefits}} <b>hypothecation</b> can bring - believing {{that people will}} be willing to pay more for better services, demonstrating the real cost of services to people and supporting democracy. These can be broken down into 4 main hypothecation-supporting points.|$|E
5000|$|In his book, Le Grand explores ways of {{increasing}} the amount of choice and competition in the public sector. This quasi-market would transform citizens from pawns to queens and [...] "improve quality and value for money". Specific policy recommendations include [...] "demogrants" [...] and <b>hypothecation</b> (earmarking).|$|E
50|$|For a {{mortgage}} to be valid, {{there must be}} a legal or natural obligation to which the <b>hypothecation</b> is accessory. In Kilburn, a husband had, before his marriage, passed and registered a notarial bond for £500 as a second charge on all his property in favour of his wife.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} known cases of <b>hypothecation</b> in Europe is the National Insurance {{contribution}} in the United Kingdom. Money that is raised goes directly to the National Insurance Fund from which the benefits are paid. This is also {{an example of the}} combination of wide and weak earmarking.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypothecation</b> is {{a common}} feature of {{consumer}} contracts involving mortgages - the debtor legally owns the house, but until the mortgage is paid off, the creditor {{has the right to}} take ownership (and possibly also possession) - but only if the debtor fails to keep up with repayments.If a consumer takes out an additional loan secured against the value of his mortgage (approximately the current value of the house minus outstanding repayments) the consumer is then hypothecating the mortgage itself - the creditor can still seize the house but in this case the creditor then becomes responsible for the outstanding mortgage debt. Sometimes consumer goods and business equipment can be bought on credit agreements involving <b>hypothecation</b> - the goods are legally owned by the borrower, but once again the creditor can seize them if required.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>hypothecation</b> {{of a tax}} (also {{known as}} the ring fencing or ear marking of a tax) is the {{dedication}} of the revenue from a specific tax for a particular expenditure purpose. This approach differs from the classical method according to which all government spending is done from a consolidated fund.|$|E
5000|$|As {{an example}} from {{different}} sector can serve television license. Users of television sets are obliged to pay an annual fee and the revenues are then used to fund public broadcasting. For example, in the UK, the money raised goes to the BBC but this type <b>hypothecation</b> is applied in many European countries.|$|E
50|$|The court held, firstly, that a {{mortgage}} bond {{may be used}} both {{as an instrument of}} <b>hypothecation</b> and also as a record of debt, and secondly that it is matter of custom in drafting mortgage bonds to incorporate an admission of liability by the mortgagor to facilitate a quick and easy remedy.|$|E
50|$|Rehypothecation occurs {{mainly in}} the {{financial}} markets, where financial firms re-use the collateral to secure their own borrowing. For the creditor the collateral does not only mitigate the credit risk but also allows to refinance more easily or at lower rates; in initial <b>hypothecation</b> contract however, the debtor can restrict such re-use of the collateral.|$|E
50|$|A {{maritime}} lien is a lien on a vessel, given {{to secure the}} claim of a creditor who provided maritime services to the vessel or who suffered an injury from the vessel's use. Maritime liens are {{sometimes referred to as}} tacit <b>hypothecation.</b> Maritime liens have little in common with other liens under the laws of most jurisdictions.|$|E
50|$|A {{mortgage}} bond, as per Thienhaus v Metje & Ziegler, is {{an instrument}} of <b>hypothecation,</b> {{a record of the}} mortgage agreement, a record of the principal debt and a debt instrument. It establishes the mortgagee’s right of mortgage (ius hypothecarium). Registration does not depend on the validity of the underlying causa, as South Africa applies the abstract system of transfer of real rights.|$|E
