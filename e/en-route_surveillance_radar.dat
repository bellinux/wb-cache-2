50|$|WAM {{provides}} {{performance that}} {{is comparable to}} secondary <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> (SSR) in terms of accuracy, probability of detection, update rate and availability/ reliability. Performance varies {{as a function of}} the location of aircraft in relation to the ground sensors.WAM is adaptable to interrogation rates, output modes and output periods. Update rates and probability of detection can be tailored to various applications such as precision runway monitoring (PRM), terminal maneuvering area (TMA) and <b>En-route</b> <b>surveillance.</b> Interrogation rates can be reduced by passively processing replies to SSR or traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) interrogations.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{secondary}} <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> (SSR) array antenna, which is intended for a system combining the secondary <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> antenna and the primary <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> antenna. It describes the patch array elements and the synthesis for the secondary <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> array, considering both elevation and azimuth patterns for sum, difference, and sidelobe-suppression beams, and suspended stripline couplers. The utilization of multilayer techniques allows the connection of layers with patch radiating elements and layers with beamforming networks...|$|R

50|$|SpotterRF Compact <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Radar</b> (SpotterRF) is a {{new class}} of <b>surveillance</b> <b>radar</b> called Compact <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Radar</b> that {{provides}} range and azimuth measurements of moving objects. It tracks moving people and vehicles from 500 to 1500 meters away in a small, lightweight package. Different variants of the system range from 3 to 5 pounds. SpotterRF systems are easy to use and only require 30-60 minutes (according to SpotterRF’s marketing material) to train personnel on how to use the system. SpotterRF systems can also integrate with programs such as Exacqvision, Milestone, VideoNext, RaptorX, and Google Earth for an effective and easy visual experience. Combined with SpotterRF’s radar management system, NetworkedIO, systems can actively cue cameras on moving targets spotted by the system. Compact <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Radar</b> (CSR) applies the technology used in the telecommunications industry to reduce the size, weight and cost of radar..|$|R
