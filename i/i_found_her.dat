500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{said that}} this episode of 30 Rock [...] "wasn't as fun and funny as it could have been", explaining that it had some great laughs, but that as a whole it [...] "felt a bit flat and joyless." [...] He wrote that the cameos by Jon Hamm, Jason Sudeikis, and Dean Winters [...] "did little {{in the body of}} the episode", nonetheless, the [...] "real payoff" [...] came in the end when the three portrayed the dental assistants. [...] "It was a gag mostly unrelated to the rest of the episode, and it was the best part of the half hour." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave it a 7.7 out of 10 rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that the episode was a [...] "pretty lifeless outing", reasoning it had the [...] "usual laughs in the margin" [...] but overall [...] "there were a lot of long, flat, deadly stretches, and entire subplots like Jenna with her stalker that just lay there." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad enjoyed Liz's story here, but noted that he disliked Jenna's stalker story, concluding [...] "...there were a few really funny lines... but overall <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> missing-her-stalker-on-Valentine's-Day plot to be rather... icky [...] Honestly, I want to see more of the human, normal side of Jenna". Nick Catucci of New York magazine felt that Liz's plot here was [...] "one of the worst story lines in recent memory".|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{her return}} to Perth in July DeMarchi {{contacted}} former bandmate Celenza {{to form a new}} band in Sydney. He was initially reluctant to go but recommended another former bandmate, Parise. In Sydney, DeMarchi approached her then-manager, John Woodruff (The Angels, Diesel [...] ), who signed the new group and referred Leslie to her. Celenza then officially joined. Woodruff later recalled [...] "I'd seen [...] in London performing some bad Stock Aitken and Waterman tunes on television late one night. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> and she turned out to be Australian. She also turned out {{to have a lot of}} attitude. I brought her back to Australia and put a band together around her." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cipriano Andrade, Jr., {{engineer}} and yacht designer, said of Spray: “After a thorough analysis of Sprays lines, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> {{to have a}} theoretically perfect balance. Her balance is marvelous — almost uncanny. Try as I would — one element after another — they all swung into the same identical line. I attacked her with proportional dividers, planimeter, rotameter, Simpson's rule, Froude's coefficients, Dixon Kemp's formulae, series, curves, differentials, and all the appliances of modern yacht designing, and she emerged from the ordeal a theoretically perfect boat. For when she is underway every element of resistance, stability, weight, heeling effort, and propulsive force is in one transverse plane, and that plane is the boat's midship section. I know of no similar case in the whole field of naval architecture, ancient or modern.” ...|$|E
2500|$|You know – & I believe saw {{once that}} odd-headed girl – who {{introduced}} herself to me shortly before I left England – {{but you do}} not know – that <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> with Shelley and her sister at Geneva – I never loved her nor pretended to love her – but a man is a man – & if a girl of eighteen comes prancing to you {{at all hours of the}} night – there is but one way – the suite of all this is that she was with child – & returned to England to assist in peopling that desolate island... This comes of [...] "putting it about" [...] (as Jackson calls it) & be dammed to it – and thus people come into the world.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{portrait}} {{was painted}} in 1900, during Williams' first year {{living in the}} Eakins home. A pendant to the first portrait, the second painting has been called [...] "a romantic fantasia, or unrestricted variation and development on the original theme"; it is more richly and loosely painted than its predecessor. In this version Addie Williams is turned fully toward the light, appears less troubled, with more richly colored skin and mouth. Her lips are fuller, eyes moister, and her hair less constrained and more natural in appearance. The characterization is more intimate, with {{the angle of the}} head implying the sense of resignation that Eakins favored in his later portraits. To Goodrich, she appears to be [...] "a kindly woman, wise, gentle, and warm, with a sense of humor— as <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>her</b> to be." [...] Her striped dress is adorned with bows and flounces which hide the body beneath vigorous strokes of red-orange paint; the handling of multi-colored drapery has been compared to virtuoso passages by Eakins' American Impressionist contemporaries. The Philadelphia Museum of Art received the painting as a gift from Susan Macdowell Eakins and Addie Williams in 1929.|$|E
