25|$|There are {{speculative}} {{theories that}} claim inertia {{is produced by}} the combined mass of the universe (e.g., Mach's principle), which implies that the rest frame of the universe might be preferred by conventional measurements of natural law. If confirmed, this would imply special relativity is an approximation to a more general theory, but since the relevant comparison would (by definition) be outside the observable universe, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> (much less construct) experiments to test this hypothesis.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} criteria, {{stability}} {{is the critical}} consideration in evaluating the effect of orbital and rotational characteristics on planetary habitability. Orbital eccentricity {{is the difference between}} a planet's farthest and closest approach to its parent star divided by the sum of said distances. It is a ratio describing the shape of the elliptical orbit. The greater the eccentricity the greater the temperature fluctuation on a planet's surface. Although they are adaptive, living organisms can stand only so much variation, particularly if the fluctuations overlap both the freezing point and boiling point of the planet's main biotic solvent (e.g., water on Earth). If, for example, Earth's oceans were alternately boiling and freezing solid, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> {{life as we know it}} having evolved. The more complex the organism, the greater the temperature sensitivity. The Earth's orbit is almost wholly circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.02; other planets in the Solar System (with the exception of Mercury) have eccentricities that are similarly benign.|$|E

Historian Joshua Levine notes that Hitler had a [...] "near-obsession with defence of Scandinavia" [...] during this period {{and that it is}} unclear how much the operation had contributed to his strategy. Michael Howard, who wrote the official British history of strategic deception, attributes the lacklustre response to severe setbacks the Allies were then facing on every front, and writes that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> the Germans believing that a major offensive operation was being planned.|$|E

500|$|Core intent {{would be}} where the {{defendant}} acted either to cause at least grievous bodily harm to the victim, or where the defendant acted to achieve some other aim, where the death caused was a necessary means to that other end. In general, the jury is directed that [...] "intent" [...] is to be taken as meaning what it does in ordinary life, and that the judge should not attempt to define it in other terms. However, following R v Woollin, {{it is also possible}} for a jury to convict if they [...] "feel sure that death or serious injury was a virtual certainty (barring some unforeseen intervention) {{as a result of the}} defendant's actions and that the defendant appreciated that such was the case" [...] known as [...] "oblique intent". Despite appearing to present an alternative to the primary, core sense of intent, courts have generally seen Woollin as allowing the jury to infer core intent from the evidence of virtual certainty. The jury are entitled to convict in these circumstances, and they should not be directed that they, finding virtual certainty, must convict. However, if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> circumstances where a jury would find virtual certainty but not convict, which would support this complicating factor. The exception for medical care is mentioned as a general principle for homicide.|$|E

2500|$|Niyazi {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} early representatives of a distinctive Uzbek literature. He is generally considered the first Uzbek playwright, the founder of modern Uzbek musical forms, as well as the founder of Uzbek social realism. His writings were also significant for being [...] "ideologically valuable" [...] in the early years of Soviet power in Uzbekistan. Although socialist realism became the [...] "official" [...] style of Uzbek literature only in 1932, Niyazi is generally credited as the founder of the movement.

2500|$|The {{architectural}} {{character of}} many of the terraces in Chinatown is much more Italianate in style than those of, for instance Emerald Hill or Petain Road. [...] Windows often appear as mere slits with narrow timber jalousies (often with adjustable slats). Fanlights over the windows are usually quite decorative and the pilasters and balconies and even the plasterwork and colours seem to be Mediterranean in flavour. The style was probably introduced by those early Chinese immigrants (both China-born and Straits-born) who had knowledge of the Portuguese architecture of Macau, Malacca and Goa. The Chettiars and Tamils from Southern India would also have been familiar with the European architecture there, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> how these people would have had a particularly strong influence on building in Chinatown.|$|E
2500|$|The gafio {{balconies}} {{serve as}} vestiges of Valle Piola's ancient connections with northern Lombardic peoples. [...] The term gafio ("lu gafie" [...] {{in the local}} Abruzzese dialect) comes from the Lombardic word [...] "waifa", meaning [...] "space which is non private." [...] These covered wooden balconies constituted precisely such areas. [...] A close examination of the gafio balconies speaks to the highly developed craftsmanship of the Abruzzese and Lombardic tradesmen while working with wooden materials. [...] The gafio balconies are unique {{in that they are}} able to support the weight of floorboards, one or more human occupants and, in the cold winter months, snow on the protective covering above.

2500|$|The {{invention}} of the solid saddle tree allowed development of the true stirrup {{as it is known}} today. [...] Without a solid tree, the rider's weight in the stirrups creates abnormal pressure points and make the horse's back sore. Modern thermography studies on [...] "treeless" [...] and flexible-tree saddle designs have found that there is considerable friction across the center line of a horse's back. A coin of Quintus Labienus, who was in service of Parthia, minted circa 39 BC depicts on its reverse a saddled horse with hanging objects. Smith suggests they are pendant cloths, while Thayer suggests that, considering the fact that the Parthians were famous for their mounted archery, the objects are stirrups, but adds that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> why the Romans would never have adopted the technology.|$|E

2500|$|Human {{sacrifice}} rituals {{were performed}} during the appropriate times each month {{with the appropriate}} number of living bodies, and other goods, to properly appease and honor the gods. These individuals were previously chosen to be sacrificed, {{as was the case}} for people embodying the gods themselves, or were members of an enemy party which had been captured and prepared to be sacrificed. Even enemies of the Aztecs understood their roles as sacrifices to the gods since many also practiced the same type of religion. [...] For many rites, the victim had such a quantity of prescribed duties that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> how the accompanying festival would have progressed without some degree of compliance {{on the part of the}} victim. For instance, victims were expected to bless children, greet and cheer passers-by, hear people's petitions to the gods, visit people in their homes, give discourses and lead sacred songs, processions and dances.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the details}} of his {{biography}} are vague and fragmentary, {{the details of}} Rameau's personal and family life are almost completely obscure. Rameau's music, so graceful and attractive, completely contradicts the man's public image and what we know of his character as described (or perhaps unfairly caricatured) by Diderot in his satirical novel Le Neveu de Rameau. Throughout his life, music was his consuming passion. It occupied his entire thinking; Philippe Beaussant calls him a monomaniac. Piron explained that [...] "His heart and soul were in his harpsichord; once he had shut its lid, there was no one home." [...] Physically, Rameau was tall and exceptionally thin, as can be seen by the sketches we have of him, including a famous portrait by Carmontelle. He had a [...] "loud voice." [...] His speech was difficult to understand, just like his handwriting, which was never fluent. As a man, he was secretive, solitary, irritable, proud of his own achievements (more as a theorist than as a composer), brusque with those who contradicted him, and quick to anger. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> him among the leading wits, including Voltaire (to whom he bears more than a passing physical resemblance), who frequented La Pouplinière's salon; his music was his passport, and it made up for his lack of social graces.|$|E

[...] The letter shows Emma's tension between her fears that differences of belief would separate them, and her desire to be close and openly share ideas. Emma cherished {{a belief in the}} afterlife, and was concerned that they should [...] "belong to each other" [...] for eternity.

[...] (14:6). Desmond and Moore note that the section continues [...] "Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned"(15:6). As disbelief later gradually crept over Darwin, he could [...] "hardly see how anyone ought to wish Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be everlastingly punished.
