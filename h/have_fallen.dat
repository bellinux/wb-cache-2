5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} areas of interpretation of John is its sacramental theology. Scholars' views <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> along a wide spectrum ranging from anti-sacramental and non-sacramental, to sacramental, to ultra-sacramental and hyper-sacramental. Scholars disagree both on whether and how frequently John refers to the sacraments at all, and {{on the degree of}} importance he places upon them. Individual scholars' answers to one of these questions do not always correspond to their answer to the other.|$|E

5|$|Despite such inaccuracies, {{the tale}} has been {{frequently}} repeated. Individual privileges that did exist <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> into disuse—for example the Lord of the Manor of Worksop (which {{is not a}} peerage) was extended the privilege and duty of attending the coronation of the British monarch until 1937, but the right was not exercised at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 as the manor was under corporate ownership at the time.|$|E
5|$|During the ice ages of {{the last}} two million years the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas have been covered by the {{expanded}} polar ice cap several times.

5|$|Extensive {{deforestation}} {{has resulted}} in loss of trees such as acacias, baobab, dates and palm trees.

5|$|A single {{reference}} in {{the tomb of}} Ahmose Pen-Nekhebet indicates another campaign in Iamu {{in the land of}} Kehek. Unfortunately, the location of Kehek is unknown. It was long believed that Kehek was a reference to the Libyan tribe, Qeheq, and thus it was postulated that invaders from Libya took advantage of the death of Ahmose to move into the western Nile Delta. Unfortunately for this theory, the Qeheq people only appeared in later times, and Kehek's identity remains unknown. Nubia is a possibility, since Amenhotep did campaign there, and the western desert and the oases have also been suggested, since these seem to <b>have</b> <b>fallen</b> under Egyptian control once again.|$|E

Alexander buried Darius' remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral. He claimed that, while dying, Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne.
