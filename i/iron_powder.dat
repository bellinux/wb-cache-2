5|$|Electrode {{coatings}} can {{consist of}} a number of different compounds, including rutile, calcium fluoride, cellulose, and <b>iron</b> <b>powder.</b> Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO2, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging embrittlement and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF2), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are hygroscopic and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. Electrodes coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, <b>iron</b> <b>powder</b> is a common coating additive that increases {{the rate at which the}} electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.|$|E
5|$|For a few limited {{purposes}} {{when it is}} needed, {{pure iron}} is produced in the laboratory in small quantities by reducing the pure oxide or hydroxide with hydrogen, or forming iron pentacarbonyl and heating it to 250°C so that it decomposes to form pure <b>iron</b> <b>powder.</b> Another method is electrolysis of ferrous chloride onto an iron cathode.|$|E
5|$|Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger and Oscar Kjellberg {{released}} the first coated electrodes. Strohmenger used clay and lime coating {{to stabilize the}} arc, while Kjellberg dipped iron wire into mixtures of carbonates and silicates to coat the electrode. In 1912, Strohmenger released a heavily coated electrode, but high cost and complex production methods prevented these early electrodes from gaining popularity. In 1927, {{the development of an}} extrusion process reduced the cost of coating electrodes while allowing manufacturers to produce more complex coating mixtures designed for specific applications. In the 1950s, manufacturers introduced <b>iron</b> <b>powder</b> into the flux coating, making it possible to increase the welding speed.|$|E

This paper {{summarizes}} physical and chemical measurements that were conducted to assess the bioavailability of these <b>iron</b> <b>powders</b> relative to ferrous sulfate, along with validation of these assessments from a study with human subjects. Commercial elemental <b>iron</b> <b>powders</b> varied in bioavailability depending on the manufacturing process. Measurements of particle surface area and of solubility compared well with measurements conducted with animal absorption and with improvement of iron status in Thai women. The dissolution rate of the elemental <b>iron</b> <b>powders</b> in dilute acid, according to a standardized procedure, may be useful as an estimate of bioavailability. Carbonyl and electrolytic iron {{were found to have}} the best bioavailability of the <b>iron</b> <b>powders,</b> and reduced forms of iron were generally less bioavailable.

It was shown that a certain amount of FeO phase is formed during mechanical activation of ultrafine <b>iron</b> <b>powders.</b> According to thermogravimetric analysis, the oxidation process of non-milled ultrafine <b>iron</b> <b>powders</b> is a complex process and occurs in three stages. The preliminary mechanical activation of powders considerably changes the nature of the <b>iron</b> <b>powders</b> oxidation, leads to increasing in the temperature of oxidation onset and shifts the reaction to higher temperatures.

25|$|In {{industrial}} practice, {{the iron}} catalyst is obtained from finely ground <b>iron</b> <b>powder,</b> {{which is usually}} obtained by reduction of high purity magnetite (Fe3O4). The pulverized iron metal is burnt (oxidized) to give magnetite of a defined particle size. The magnetite particles are then partially reduced, removing some of the oxygen in the process. The resulting catalyst particles consist of a core of magnetite, encased in a shell of wüstite (FeO), {{which in turn is}} surrounded by an outer shell of iron metal. The catalyst maintains most of its bulk volume during the reduction, resulting in a highly porous high surface area material, which enhances its effectiveness as a catalyst. Other minor components of the catalyst include calcium and aluminium oxides, which support the iron catalyst and help it maintain its surface area. These oxides of Ca, Al, K, and Si are unreactive to reduction by the hydrogen.|$|E

500|$|When {{steel is}} {{immersed}} in water, adding a small concentration (55ppm) of potassium pertechnetate(VII) {{to the water}} protects the steel from corrosion, even if the temperature is raised to [...] For this reason, pertechnetate {{has been used as}} an anodic corrosion inhibitor for steel, although technetium's radioactivity poses problems that limit this application to self-contained systems. While (for example) [...] can also inhibit corrosion, it requires a concentration ten times as high. In one experiment, a specimen of carbon steel was kept in an aqueous solution of pertechnetate for 20years and was still uncorroded. The mechanism by which pertechnetate prevents corrosion is not well understood, but seems to involve the reversible formation of a thin surface layer (passivation). One theory holds that the pertechnetate reacts with the steel surface to form a layer of technetium dioxide which prevents further corrosion; the same effect explains how <b>iron</b> <b>powder</b> can be used to remove pertechnetate from water. (Activated carbon can also be used for the same purpose.) The effect disappears rapidly if the concentration of pertechnetate falls below the minimum concentration or if too high a concentration of other ions is added.|$|E

The coating materials and coated <b>iron</b> <b>powders</b> were analysed by FTIR, electron and atomic force microscopy. Results showed that introduction of the organic phase imparted desirable hydrophobicity and flexibility to the coating, whilst still providing effective electrical insulation at temperatures up to 500 °C. The hybrid coatings covered the iron particle surface very effectively and formed continuous coatings that could remain intact even after compaction at pressures up to 900 MPa, depending on the coating amount.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{densification}} of white cast <b>iron</b> <b>powders</b> under stress {{can be enhanced}} by multiple phase transformations through thermal cycling. This enhancement occurs by accelerated creep flow during phase changes (transformation superplasticity). The approximate stress range where transformation-assisted densification can occur is shown to be between 1. 7 MPa (250 psi) and 34. 5 MPa (5000 psi). Below 1. 7 MPa insufficient strain occurs during phase transformation to cause significant densification even after many transformation cycles. Above 34. 5 MPa, densification occurs principally by normal slip creep. Transformation warm pressing of white cast <b>iron</b> <b>powders</b> leads to dense compacts at low pressures and short times. In addition, because the transformation temperature is low, the ultrafine structures existing in the original powders are retained in the densified compacts. Peer reviewe...|$|R
