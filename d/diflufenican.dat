40|$|In recent years, an {{increasing}} occurrence {{of resistance to}} Apera spica-venti, especially to ALS inhibitors and partially to ACCase inhibitors has been reported for the new federal states, too. The dominance of winter wheat and winter rape in crop rotations associated with a unilateral application of herbicides has increased the selection pressure. In order to counter further spread of herbicide resistance, the right choice of the mode of action of the herbicide or herbicide combination and highly efficacious herbicide treatments are the methods of choice, of course {{in addition to the}} agronomic aspects, such as sowing date and crop rotation. The research determined how and to what extent dicotyledonous weeds are associated with loose silkybentgrass. Based on the results, single herbicides or herbicide tank mixes were tested to achieve the expected level of control. As a result, treatments which have achieved very high level of control against A. spica-venti and the most common dicotyledonous weeds can be recommended. A total of 191 trial sites have been included in the analysis of A. spica-venti. Using the HRAC-classification of herbicides used, groups were formed which might contribute to solving problems specifically linked to the detected resistance situation of the site. In the autumn, flufenacet-containing herbicides, such as Malibu (flufenacet, pendimethalin), Herold SC (flufenacet, <b>diflufenican),</b> Bacara Forte (flufenacet, flurtamone, <b>diflufenican),</b> Carmina 640 (chlortoluron, <b>diflufenican)</b> and Fenikan (isoproturon, <b>diflufenican)</b> demonstrated high efficiency against A. spica-venti. Combinations of herbicides with the HRAC classification of N and E provide further opportunities for the implementation of anti-resistance management strategies, such as Sumimax + Ciral (flumioxazin + metsulfuron, flupyrsulfuron) or Boxer (prosulfocarb) + Diflanil 500 SC (<b>diflufenican)</b> or Beflex (beflubutamid).

40|$|In a {{pear tree}} orchard planted on loam soil, each plot was treated in April 1998 with {{either one of}} the ureas diuron or chlorotoluron, or {{triazine}} simazine herbicides applied at 3, 4, and 2 kg AI ha(- 1), respectively. Some plots had not been previously treated {{with one of these}} herbicides. Other plots had been treated annually during the past 12 years with the same herbicide. One herbicide, and always the same, was thus applied to each plot. In the plots treated {{for the first time with}} either diuron, chlorotoluron, or simazine, the soil half-lives of these herbicides in the 0 - 10 cm surface soil layer were 81, 64, and 59 days, respectively. In the plots treated with the same herbicide for 12 years, the corresponding soil half-lives were 37, 11, and 46 days. Diuron thus produced a moderately enhanced biodegradation, chlorotoluron a high one, and simazine a low but significant one. In another pear tree orchard planted on sandy loam soil, each plot was treated in April 1998 with one of the amide propyzamide (1. 25 or 1. 0 AI kg ha(- 1)) or <b>diflufenican</b> (250 g AI ha(- 1)) herbicides. In the plots not previously treated with propyzamide, the propyzamide soil half-life was the same for both doses, i. e., about 30 days.

Variability in DT 25 was higher in the sandy-loam in which there was also greatest variability in soil chemical and microbial properties. Technical error associated with pesticide extraction, analysis and lack of model fit during derivation of DT 25 accounted for between 5. 3 and 25. 8 % of the variability for isoproturon and azoxystrobin, but could account for almost all the variability for. <b>diflufenican.</b> Azoxystrobin DT 25, sorption and pH were significantly correlated.

40|$|In {{vegetative}} filter strips used {{to intercept}} pesticides present in run-off, {{particulate organic matter}} derived from the vegetation plays an important function in pesticide sorption processes, because it accumulates at the soil surface and quickly responds to changes in land use. Two herbicides with contrasted properties: isoproturon, moderately hydrophobic (log Kow ¼ 2. 5), <b>diflufenican,</b> strongly hydrophobic (log Kow ¼ 4. 9), and isopropylaniline, a metabolite of isoproturon, were used to characterize the sorption and desorption properties of POM originating from soils under three different land uses: a cropped plot under conventional wheat/maize rotation, an adjacent 10 -year-old grassed strip and a nearby 80 -year-old oak/chestnut forest. Chemical structural composition information obtained from solid-state 13 C CPMAS NMR and estimation of hydrophobicity from contact angle measurements were used to explain the different sorption capacities of POM according to their size and origins. Sorption of isoproturon and <b>diflufenican</b> increased with hydrophobicity of POM, which was greater in the forest soil. Aromaticity of POM was positively correlated to sorption coefficients (Koc). Desorption of the more hydrophobic compounds, <b>diflufenican</b> and isopropylaniline was weak for all POM fractions, regardless of their origin and size.

40|$|Much {{attention}} has been given to the use of pesticides in the field and the risk of pollution of ground and surface water. A major point source of contamination is spills during filling and cleaning of spraying equipment. One possible approach to reduce this contamination is to treat the pesticide contaminated water, using on-farm biopurification systems. In these systems organic wastes are biologically degraded by the stimulation of the activity of indigenous microorganisms (biostimulation) or by the inoculation of microorganisms with specific biotransforming abilities (bioaugmentation). The aim of the present work was to evaluate the abilities of white-rot Lentinula edodes fungus to degrade the herbicides terbuthylazine, <b>diflufenican</b> and pendimethalin. Among degradation microorganisms, white-rot fungi have demonstrated the ability to degrade a wide variety of aromatic xenobiotics, including polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and various groups of pesticides.

Two freshwater fish species (Perca fluviatilis and Cyprinus carpio) were exposed to a mixture of these 13 pesticides, via multi-contaminated pellets, and then, eliminated. Compounds were measured in food, water and muscle tissue using multi-residues methods. Kinetics, biomagnification factors (BMFs) and half-lives (t 1 / 2) were estimated and they did not show a large difference between the species. Muscular BMFs ranged from 2 x 10 (- 6) (mesosulfuron-methyl in perch) to 1 x 10 (- 3) (isoproturon and napropamid in perch) and t 1 / 2 ranged from 0. 8 (mesosulfuronmethyl in perch) to 40. 3 d (napropamid in carp). BMFs were also modeled as a function of K-ow value.

Treatments included 10 ACCase inhibitors, 6 Acetolactate Synthase (ALS) inhibitors, prosulfocarb, flamprop-M-isopropyl, isoproturon plus <b>diflufenican</b> and a non-sprayed control. To evaluate the effects of treatments, different characteristics including percent damage based on EWRC scores at 15 and 30 days after spraying, percentage of survived plants after spraying relative to before spraying, and percentage of dry weight and wet weight of individual plants relative to control were studied.

40|$|An {{approach}} {{to reduce the}} contamination of water sourceswith pesticides {{is the use of}} biopurificaction systems. The active core of these systems is the biomixture. The composition of biomixtures depends on the availability of local agro-industrial wastes and design should be adapted to every region. In Portugal, cork processing is generally regarded as environmentally friendly and would be interesting to find applications for its industry residues. In this work the potential use of different substrates in biomixtures, as cork (CBX); cork and straw, coat pine and LECA (Light Expanded Clay Aggregates), was tested on the degradation of terbuthylazine, difenoconazole, <b>diflufenican</b> and pendimethalin pesticides. Bioaugmentation strategies using the white-rot fungus Lentinula edodes inoculated into the CBX, was also assessed. The results obtained from this study clearly demonstrated the relevance of using natural biosorbents as cork residues to increase the capacity of pesticide dissipation in biomixtures for establishing biobeds. Furthermore, higher degradation of all the pesticides was achieved by use of bioaugmented biomixtures. Indeed, the biomixtures inoculated with L. edodes EL 1 were able to mineralize the selected xenobiotics, revelling that these white-rot fungi might be a suitable fungus for being used as inoculum sources in on-farm sustainable biopurification system, in order to increase its degradation efficiency. After 120 days, maximum degradation of terbuthylazine, difenoconazole, <b>diflufenican</b> and pendimethalin, of bioaugmented CBX, was 89. 9 %, 75. 0 %, 65. 0 % and 99. 4 %, respectively. The dominant metabolic route of terbuthylazine in biomixtures inoculated with L. edodes EL 1 proceeded mainly via hydroxylation, towards production of terbuthylazine-hydroxy- 2 metabolite.

In models currently used for pesticide registration freezing of soil is not accounted for, even though some substances –especially those applied in autumn– may persist throughout the winter. The objective {{of this study was}} to quantify the effect of soil freezing on pesticide leaching for a Swedish clayey topsoil. The herbicides clomazone, propyzamide and <b>diflufenican</b> and the non-reactive tracer bromide were applied to undisturbed soil columns (20 cm high, 12. 5 cm diameter), which were frozen to - 2 °C and exposed to simulated rain. Three repetitions of the freezing-irrigation cycle were performed. Pesticide and bromide concentrations were measured in the effluent and compared to the results of non-frozen columns. X-ray tomography was used to visualise and quantify the macropore structure. Most concentrations of the least mobile pesticide (<b>diflufenican)</b> were below the limit of quantification. Relative leaching of pesticides was between 0. 15 % and 2. 67 % of the applied amount for clomazone and between 0. 10 % and 1. 67 % for propyzamide. Considering all three irrigation events no significant difference was found between frozen and non-frozen soil columns regarding pesticide transport. However, relative leaching in percent of the applied amount as well as concentrations of clomazone and propyzamide were significantly higher in the non-frozen columns during the second irrigation event. The non-reactive tracer showed the same trend, with the difference that the major part of the transport appeared already during the first irrigation event, showing significantly higher amounts of bromide transported in the non-frozen columns. A possible explanation is that soil freezing created fine voids and therefore increased diffusion into soil aggregates and reduced preferential transport...|$|E

Ensuring good pre-emergence control is therefore increasingly important to protect yields. Prosulfocarb is a broad spectrum thiocarbamate herbicide that kills plants by disrupting the biosynthesis of very long chain fatty acids. This is the first report of resistance to prosulfocarb in Lolium species from farm sites and glasshouse selection. The recurrent selection process with prosulfocarb applied pre-emergence at its maximum labelled rate (4, 000 gai/ha) on a susceptible Lolium multiflorum Lam. population showed that the {{evolution of}} resistance due to repetitive use was possible but slow. Over three generations, it resulted in modicum levels of resistance which were not significant at practical field rates. For the last progeny obtained, {{there was no evidence}} of either cross-resistance or increased sensitivity to an herbicide under-development with a mode of action similar to prosulfocarb (RF 50 = 0. 99, 95 % CI = 0. 77 - 1. 27). Likewise, high and increasing levels of non-target-site based resistance to clodinafop-propargyl did not result in cross-resistance to prosulfocarb. Prosulfocarb exerted low levels of negative cross-resistance on LL 1781, SS 1999, GG 2078 and RR 2088, four different ACCase mutant L. multiflorum sublines (average RF 50 = 0. 67).

Over the 86 mixtures tested, 11 showed a high potential. Prosulfocarb + <b>diflufenican</b> at 2, 400 + 32 gai/ha presented interesting levels of synergism (+ 20 points on average). A non-random survey in 34 farm sites from England showed that most Lolium samples (80 %) were sensitive or only partially resistant to prosulfocarb. However, prosulfocarb efficacy was lower where other herbicides had been used intensively.

In this study, {{we proposed a}} generic method for the quantification of 13 pesticides (azoxystrobin, clomazone, <b>diflufenican,</b> dimethachlor, carbendazim, iprodion, isoproturon, mesosulfuron-methyl, metazachlor, napropamid, quizalofop and thifensulfuron-methyl) in three environmental matrices. Pesticides from water were extracted using a solid phase extraction system and a single solid-liquid extraction method was optimized for sediment and fish muscle, followed by a unique analysis by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Limits of quantification were below 5 ng L− 1 for water (except for fluroxypyr and iprodion) and ranged between 0. 1 ng g− 1 and 57. 7 ng g− 1 for sediments and regarding fish, were below 1 ng g− 1 for 8 molecules and were determined between 5 and 49 ng g− 1 for the 5 other compounds.

40|$|Alopecurus myosuroides and Apera spica-venti are {{the most}} {{important}} grass weeds in German cereal cropping systems. Both species show increasing resistance problems with herbicide resistant biotypes in many regions. In many cases, non target-site resistance (TSR) mechanism can be detected. In these biotypes resistance is assumingly based on non target-site-mechanisms (NTSR) and an enhanced metabolism might be responsible in the first place. Resistance in A. spica-venti biotypes can also be found against pre-emergence herbicides like <b>diflufenican</b> and pendimethalin. However, untill now no resistance in A. spica-venti against the active ingredients flurtamone, flufenacet and prosulfocarb could be detected. A. myosuroides biotypes also frequently show NTSR mechanisms. Resistance patterns are variable and predictions about the efficacy of one herbicide cannot be made based on the knowledge of the effects of another ingredient even within the same mode of action group. The resistance patterns of different A. myosuroides biotypes and crosses indicate a complex, polygenetic control of NTSR mechanisms...|$|E

30|$|Inhibition of {{carotenoid}} biosynthesis {{in general}} is a mode of action shared by macrocidins and various synthetic herbicides such as norflurozon, fluridone and <b>diflufenican</b> [19],[20]. However, the way(s) in which macrocidins impact this process appear to be unique from, and more complex than, the modes of action of known synthetic herbicides (unpublished data). Hence, P. macrostoma could provide a valuable alternative to control weeds with resistance to carotenoid biosynthesis targeting synthetic herbicides. Phytotoxins produced by some plant pathogenic fungi are harmful to animals and/or humans [21]. Berestetskiy [21] gives examples such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria tenuissima, Penicillium spp. and Fusarium spp., all of which produce harmful mycotoxins. However, macrocidins and P. macrostoma are safe for humans, animals and the environment, effective against {{a wide range of}} weeds and have a long shelf-life [8]. Hence P. macrostoma and its secondary metabolites are a good choice for urban lawn and golf course weed control. In 2011 and 2012, P. macrostoma was registered for broadleaf weed control in turfgrass in Canada and the USA, respectively.|$|E

In this study, adapted QuEChERS method, coupled to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (Scheduled MRM- 5500 QTRAP), {{was developed to}} quantify 13 pesticides (azoxystrobin, clomazone, <b>diflufenican,</b> dimethachlor, carbendazim, iprodion, isoproturon, mesosulfuron-methyl, metazachlor, napropamid, quizalofop and thifensulfuron-methyl) in muscle of fish. Quantification limits were below 1 ng g− 1 except for clomazone (1. 8 ng g− 1) and quizalofop (7. 4 ng g− 1). Best recoveries were observed for perch (> 80 %) and roach (> 68 %), except for thifensulfuron-methyl. Lower recoveries had been observed for carp (6 % to 86 %). Relative standard deviation was lower than 28 % for intra-day and 29 % for inter-day analysis, respectively. This method was successfully tested on three fish species, naturally or orally exposed: roach (Rutilus rutilus), perch (Perca fluviatilis) and carp (Cyprinus carpio).

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{substantial}} {{fraction of}} the applied crop protection products on crops is lost to the atmosphere. Models describing the prediction of volatility and potential fate of these substances in the environment have become an important tool in the pesticide authorisation procedure at the EU level. The main topic {{of this research is}} to assess the rate and extent of volatilisation of ten pesticides after application on field crops. RESULTS: For eight of the ten pesticides, the volatilisation rates modelled with PEARL (Pesticide Emission Assessment at Regional and Local scales) corresponded well to the calculated rates modelled with ADMS (Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System). For the other pesticides, large {{differences were found between the}} models. Formulation might affect the volatilisation potential of pesticides. Increased leaf wetness increased the volatilisation of propyzamide and trifloxystrobin at the end of the field trial. The reliability of pesticide input parameters, in particular the vapour pressure, is discussed. CONCLUSION: Volatilisation of propyzamide, pyrimethanil, chlorothalonil, <b>diflufenican,</b> tolylfluanid, cyprodinil and E- and Z-dimethomorph from crops under realistic environmental conditions can be modelled with the PEARL model, as corroborated against field observations. Suggested improvements to the volatilisation component in PEARL should include formulation attributes and leaf wetness at the time of pesticide application. </p...|$|E

Besides actions relative {{to the way the}} substances are introduced into the environment, it is also possible to limit the contamination by interfering on their transfer pathways from fields to the main river network. Especially, interface areas such as buffer strips or small ditches may play a major part in pesticide diffuse pollution decrease. In ditches a great variety of materials may act as sorbents for organic contaminants: grass, leaves, wood debris or sediments. In this study, laboratory experiments were designed to determine sorption characteristics for three herbicides with different physicochemical properties on sediment and leaves in decay commonly found in agricultural ditches. Sorption capacities were assessed for the herbicides isoproturon, diuron and <b>diflufenican.</b> Experimental design was carried out to investigate the effects of five parameters on herbicide sorption on sediment and dead leaves. These parameters have been chosen according to parallel field experiment needs. Thus, the influence of initial sorbent moisture, herbicide form, i. e. active substance or commercial formulation, water quality (tap or natural ditch water), bromide ions (used as conservative tracers) and solid/liquid ratio have been tested. Within the parameters investigated, pesticide formulation and solid/liquid ratio were the most important parameters affecting pesticide sorption on both ditch materials...|$|E
40|$|Summary •  Oil {{crops are}} a very {{important}} commodity. Although many genes and enzymes involved in lipid accumulation have been identified, much less is known of regulation of the overall process. To address the latter we have applied metabolic control analysis to lipid synthesis in the important crop, oilpalm (Elaeis guineensis). •  Top-down metabolic control analysis (TDCA) was applied to callus cultures capable of accumulating appreciable triacylglycerol. The biosynthetic pathway was divided into two blocks, connected by the intermediate acyl-CoAs. Block A comprised enzymes for fatty acid synthesis and Block B comprised enzymes of lipid assembly. •  Double manipulation TDCA used <b>diflufenican</b> and bromooctanoate to inhibit Block A and Block B, respectively, giving Block flux control coefficients of 0. 61 and 0. 39. Monte Carlo simulations provided extra information from previously-reported single manipulation TDCA data, giving Block flux control coefficients of 0. 65 and 0. 35 for A and B. •  These experiments are {{the first time that}} double manipulation TDCA has been applied to lipid biosynthesis in any organism. The data show that approaching two-thirds of the total control of carbon flux to lipids in oilpalm cultures lies with the fatty acid synthesis block of reactions. This quantitative information will assist future, informed, genetic manipulation of oilpalm...|$|E
40|$|The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii {{provides}} a tractable genetic model to study herbicide {{mode of action}} using forward genetics. The herbicide norflurazon inhibits phytoene desaturase, which is required for carotenoid synthesis. Locating amino acid substitutions in mutant phytoene desaturases conferring norflurazon resistance {{provides a}} genetic approach to map the herbicide binding site. We isolated a UV-induced mutant able to grow in very high concentrations of norflurazon (150 µM). The phytoene desaturase gene in the mutant strain contained the first resistance mutation to be localised to the dinucleotide-binding Rossmann-likedomain. A highly conserved phenylalanine amino acid at position 131 of the 564 amino acid precursor protein was changed to a valine in the mutant protein. F 131, and two other amino acids whose substitution confers norflurazon resistance in homologous phytoene desaturase proteins, map to distant regions in the primary sequence of the C. reinhardtii protein (V 472, L 505) but in tertiary models these residues cluster together to a region close to the predicted FAD binding site. The mutant gene allowed direct 5 µM norflurazon based selection of transformants, which were tolerant to other bleaching herbicides including fluridone, flurtamone, and <b>diflufenican</b> but were more sensitive to beflubutamid than wild type cells. Norflurazon resistance and beflubutamid sensitivity allow either positive or negative selection against transformants expressing the mutant phytoene desaturase gene...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years in practice, soil acting {{herbicides}} have become the backbone for the control of heavy infestations of grass weed populations. The known unsteady efficacy of HRAC group K 1, K 3 and N herbicides is controversially discussed and became linked {{with the development of}} herbicide resistance. In general, the testing of soil-acting compounds even under controlled glasshouse conditions as well as the confirmation of possible resistance is difficult and needs specific methods and a careful result interpretation. The reliability of test methods is therefore of extreme importance. The reference testing procedure such as plant density, irrigation and temperature conditions have been shown to influence the activity of the soil applied herbicides and to result in extreme differences in the efficacy levels in general, but also in differences between resistant and susceptible biotypes. In our trials, the seed density could be ranked as the most sensitive factor. Of the tested products, Cadou SC was the most consistent herbicide followed by Boxer and Stomp Aqua. Possible reduced efficacy effects in glasshouse trials could not be verified by field trial results. The evaluation of field trials from Northern Germany did not show a significant decrease in sensitivity of black-grass (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds.) to flufenacet or flufenact plus <b>diflufenican.</b> It could be shown that seasonal variation in soil moisture, amount of rainfall, temperature conditions and application timing all influenced the efficacy level in the field the most...|$|E
40|$|Three natural somatic {{mutations}} at codon 304 of the phytoene desaturase gene (pds) of Hydrilla verticillata (L. f. Royle) {{have been}} reported to provide resistance to the herbicide fluridone. We substituted the arginine 304 present in the wild-type H. verticillata phytoene desaturase (PDS) with all 19 other natural amino acids and tested PDS against fluridone. In in vitro assays, the threonine (Thr), cysteine (Cys), alanine (Ala) and glutamine (Gln) mutations imparted the highest resistance to fluridone. Thr, the three natural mutations [Cys, serine (Ser), histidine (His) ] and the wild-type PDS protein were tested in vitro against seven inhibitors of PDS representing several classes of herbicides. These mutations conferred cross-resistance to norflurazon and overall negative cross-resistance to beflubutamid, picolinafen and <b>diflufenican.</b> The T 3 generation of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants harbouring the four selected mutations and wild-type pds had similar patterns of crossresistance to the herbicides as observed in the in vitro assays. The Thr 304 Hydrilla pds mutant proved to be an excellent marker for the selection of transgenic plants. Seedlings harbouring Thr 304 pds had a maximum resistance to sensitivity (R/S) ratio of 57 and 14 times higher than that of the wild-type for treatments with norflurazon and fluridone, respectively. These plants exhibited normal growth and development, even after long-term exposure to herbicide.

40|$|Pour lutter contre les pollutions diffuses en milieu rural, de nombreux {{programmes}} d'action se mettent en place. Le développement de recherches sur les connexions parcelle - cours d'eau devrait permettre de mieux comprendre le transfert et la dissipation des polluants dans ce milieu. En particulier, les fossés, structures relativement fréquentes dans les territoires cultivés, peuvent, a priori, avoir une fonction de court-circuit et donc faciliter le transfert des produits phytosanitaires, ou {{au contraire}} constituer des éléments de pondération de la pollution. Afin d'éclaircir ce point, une première série d'expérimentations a été menée par le Cemagref (Institut français de recherche pour l'ingénierie de l'agriculture et de l'environnement) dans des fossés de drainage agricole. Une solution aqueuse contenant trois herbicides aux caractéristiques physico-chimiques différentes (isoproturon, diuron et diflufénicanil), et un traceur (chlorures) a été injectée pendant quelques minutes dans quatre fossés. Des échantillons d'eau ont été prélevés à pas de temps fins à deux emplacements en aval du point d'injection. Après dosage par chromatographie au laboratoire, les résultats indiquent une diminution du flux et de la concentration maximale du pic de polluants comparativement à un traceur. En outre, la variation observée est corrélée aux propriétés physico-chimiques des produits, en particulier au coefficient de partage Koc. L'étude présentée montre que la surface de contact (liée à la nature du substrat) et le temps de contact (dépendant essentiellement des conditions d'écoulement) entre les polluants et le substrat sont les paramètres qui influent majoritairement sur la dissipation des produits phytosanitaires. The use of pesticide {{may lead to}} the contamination of surface and groundwaters. Agricultural nonpoint source pollution originates from land areas which intermittently contribute to the compound transfer to water. Several studies report on the occurrence of pesticides in surface water resources, with concentrations over the limit set by the 80 / 778 EEC directive for drinking water (0. 1 µg/L for each substance and 0. 5 µg/L for all pesticides). Numerous herbicides of different chemical families are detected in surface waters, especially triazines and ureas. Their concentrations vary with time and space partly in relation with application patterns and pluviometry. Maximum concentrations are linked to runoff, originating from agricultural fields and primarily occur right after the application periods. Many methods and levels of actions can be used to reduce water pollution. First, better agricultural practices can be set up, such as choosing the best dose and application period, controlling toxic substance impacts, combining with non-chemical practices. However, pesticide losses from fields can't be totally cancelled because of the complexity of the involved parameters (agricultural practices, climatic conditions, soil physical, chemical and biological properties …). In fact drift during application, runoff or drainage systems may still occur and have an effect on water quality. It may be then pertinent to evaluate to which extent the non treated areas between the fields and the surface water bodies can dissipate pesticide concentrations before they reach them. Pesticides leaving a plot in surface runoff may pass through various landscape components before reaching rivers; including another field, a ditch, a small brook, a vegetative buffer zone. Besides, pesticide leaving the plot through drainage straightly moves agricultural ditches or streams. However, the contribution of each of these elements in pesticide dissipation is not well known, except for buffer zones (grassed or forest strips) (PATTY (1997). Cemagref (a French research institute), CEH Wallingford and ITCF (Institut Technique des Cereales et des Fourrages) attempt to extend their study to the other elements as agricultural ditches. This paper deals with the role of farm ditches and small streams in the transport and retention of pesticides from fields to the main river network. Their presence seems to {{play a significant role in}} the transfer of nonpoint source pollution (especially in the West of France). Indeed they can either accelerate pesticide transport or reduce it, according to their characteristics (length, flow, bottom sediment or soil characteristics, plants and organic matter contents, etc.). Since 1998, Cemagref has been investigating the retention of pesticides by several natural ditches with varied flows and substratum. A water solution containing three herbicides with different physico chemical properties (<b>diflufenican,</b> diuron and isoproturon) and potassium chloride, a tracer, is introduced with a pump in each ditch for about five minutes with a constant concentration. Water samples are collected in the ditches every two or five minutes at two distances from the injection point. The samples are stored in amber polyethylene terephtalate bottles and frozen. Laboratory analysis is performed by liquid-liquid extraction with dichloromethane and then liquid or gas chromatography depending on the compounds. The analysis of the water samples highlights a reduction of the maximum concentration and of the accumulative mass of each pesticide with distance compared to the tracer. Indeed, even if all the chloride ions used as tracers are not recovered at each sampling point (due to infiltration or lateral losses), we notice more significant losses for all the studied herbicides. The reduction can reach 70 % of the applied mass for <b>diflufenican</b> compared to the tracer. The retention of pesticides is also linked to their own physical and chemical properties. Thus, <b>diflufenican,</b> which has the highest sorption coefficient value, Koc, is also the most retained pesticide, whereas the total injected mass of isoproturon is recovered in most cases. Diuron has an intermediate behaviour. In brief, this field experiment proves that the surface and time of contact between pollutants and substratum are likely to play a major role in pesticide retention. An estimated adsorption capacity of each ditch has been assessed, which is based on laboratory sorption experiments on different natural substratum. Despite the few data, a relationship between <b>diflufenican</b> retention in ditches and the estimated adsorption capacity of each ditch has been underscored. This study also highlighted major limits of field experiments. For example, accurate flow measurements are really difficult to carry out with simple methods for low values. The conventional techniques can't be used with small water height or in ditch where the bottom is filled with plants or grass. Chloride ion was chosen in this study because it is easy to analyze, but the results showed an initial presence of chloride ion in the natural ditch water which incites to replace it by another tracer such as bromide with is not found in the environment in future field experiments. For all these reasons, some pilot experiments with a physical model (an artificial ditch of 8 m long and 0. 4 m wide) are now designed. This equipment allows to adjust and control hydrodynamic parameters such as water flow, water height, and the nature and structure of the substratum. Then, it is possible to quantify both the role played by the substratum, mainly the organic matter content, and the role of the contact time. These parameters could be then taken into account in order to optimize further experiments on adsorption. The primary tests without substratum already give references for hydrodynamic measurements, as the stability of the water flow and the homogeneity of the initial solution concentration...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn humans, the ATP-binding {{cassette}} efflux transporter ABCG 2 {{contributes to}} the fetoprotective barrier function of the placenta, potentially limiting the toxicity of transporter substrates to the fetus. During testing of chemicals including pesticides, developmental toxicity studies are performed in rabbit. Despite its toxicological relevance, ABCG 2 -mediated transport of pesticides in rabbit placenta has not been yet elucidated. We therefore generated polarized MDCK II cells expressing the ABCG 2 transporter from rabbit placenta (rbABCG 2) and evaluated interaction of the efflux transporter with selected insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides. The Hoechst H 33342 accumulation assay indicated that 13 widely used pesticidal active substances including azoxystrobin, carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, chlormequat, <b>diflufenican,</b> dimethoate, dimethomorph, dithianon, ioxynil, methiocarb, propamocarb, rimsulfuron and toclofos-methyl may be rbABCG 2 inhibitors and/or substrates. No such evidence was obtained for chlorpyrifos-methyl, epoxiconazole, glyphosate, imazalil and thiacloprid. Moreover, chlorpyrifos (CPF), dimethomorph, tolclofos-methyl and rimsulfuron showed concentration-dependent inhibition of H 33342 excretion in rbABCG 2 -transduced MDCKII cells. To further evaluate the role of rbABCG 2 in pesticide transport across the placenta barrier, we generated polarized MDCKII-rbABCG 2 monolayers. Confocal microscopy confirmed correct localization of rbABCG 2 protein in the apical plasma membrane. In transepithelial flux studies, we showed the time-dependent preferential basolateral to apical (B>A) directed transport of [14 C] CPF across polarized MDCKII-rbABCG 2 monolayers which was significantly inhibited by the ABCG 2 inhibitor fumitremorgin C (FTC). Using this novel in vitro cell culture model, we altogether showed functional secretory activity of the ABCG 2 transporter from rabbit placenta and identified several pesticides like the insecticide CPF as potential rbABCG 2 substrates...|$|E
