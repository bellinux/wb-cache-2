Scientific evidence supports the benefits of dietary supplements <b>for</b> <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> certain health conditions. In some cases, vitamin supplements may have unwanted effects, especially if taken before surgery, with other dietary supplements or medicines, or if the person taking them has certain health conditions.

Although much less commonly available, nucleic acid testing (e.g., viral RNA or proviral DNA amplification method) can also help diagnosis in certain situations. In addition, a few tested specimens might provide inconclusive results because of a low quantity specimen. In these situations, a second specimen is collected and tested for HIV infection.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{individuals}} with MS were advised against participation {{in physical activity}} due to worsening symptoms. However, {{under the direction of}} an expert, participation in physical activity can be safe and has been proven beneficial <b>for</b> <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> MS. Research has supported the rehabilitative role of physical activity in improving muscle power, mobility, mood, bowel health, general conditioning and quality of life. Depending on the person, activities may include resistance training, walking, swimming, yoga, tai chi, and others. Determining an appropriate and safe exercise program is challenging and must be carefully individualized to each person being sure to account for all contraindications and precautions.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{departed}} from {{the idea that the}} provision of budget <b>for</b> the <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> disabilities is a very important thing. Recalling this problem, a good regulation is required. This study raised a problem of the urgency of budgeting <b>for</b> the <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> disabilities and the funding strategy as well as the juridical strategy in governing the budget <b>for</b> the <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> disabilities. This study employed a juridical analytical method, a research which is conducted to analyze certain provision of law to be used later in answering the society 2 ̆ 7 problem. From the research, it could be found that the provision of fund to provide the infrastructures <b>for</b> the <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> disabilities is very urgent. Such urgency included the reasons concerning the funding provision <b>for</b> the <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> disabilities and the determination of their needs required the funding provision. The budgeting strategy <b>for</b> the <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> disabilities is highly dependent on who is responsible for the affairs concerning the <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> disabilities. In the context of the relationship division between Central Government and Local Government, it includes those decentralized to local areas. For that reason, the local areas could provide it from Local Original Income (PAD) deriving from Entertainment Tax with earmarking pattern. When it was not sufficient, recalling that the existing local tax potential was inadequate or null, the funding <b>for</b> the <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> disabilities could be provided by Central Government and the other legitimate source of funds. The regulation strategy which should be taken is to amend the Law Number 28 of 2009 and Law Numer 40 of 2007 on Corporate Social Responsibility, to establish the Law of the <b>Persons</b> <b>with</b> Disabilities to govern the funding...|$|R

5|$|Major {{entry points}} to Skyline Drive located in Front Royal, Thornton Gap, Swift Run Gap, and Rockfish Gap. Fees are {{collected}} at the Skyline Drive's four access points. The fee is not a toll charged to drive on the road, but rather an entry fee for the park itself. Various passes allow for admission to the park. A $25.00 pass is valid for unlimited entrances within a seven-day period for a private non-commercial vehicle. A seven-day pass costs $15.00 for motorcycles and $10.00 for individuals 16 {{years of age or}} older entering by means other than a private non-commercial vehicle. Commercial tours pay between $25.00 and $200.00 for a seven-day pass, depending on the number of passengers. An annual park pass costs $50.00 for a private non-commercial vehicle. Entrance can also be gained through the America the Beautiful: National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands Pass series. In this series, the Annual Pass costs $80.00, the lifetime Senior Pass costs $10.00, the lifetime Access Pass allows free admission <b>for</b> <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> disabilities, and the Volunteer Pass allows free admission for volunteers who work 250 service hours for the following year. A free Annual Pass is also available for members of the United States Armed Forces and fourth graders can get free admission for their whole family through the Every Kid in a Park Pass.|$|E
5|$|The American Psychiatric Association (APA) {{guidelines}} note that, in general, benzodiazepines {{are well}} tolerated, {{and their use}} for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, SSRIs, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and psychotherapy {{should be based on}} the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing benzodiazepine dependence. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines <b>for</b> <b>persons</b> <b>with</b> depressive symptoms or a recent history of substance abuse. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.|$|E
