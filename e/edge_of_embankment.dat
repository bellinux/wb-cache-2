60|$|So far no one {{had seen}} Billy since he had passed from the ken of the trussed deputy sheriff, and as Billy had no desire to be seen he slipped over the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>embankment</b> into a dry ditch, where he squatted upon his {{haunches}} waiting for the train to depart. The stop out there in the dark night was one of those mysterious stops which trains are prone to make, unexplained and doubtless unexplainable by any other than a higher intelligence which directs the movements of men and rolling stock. There was no town, and not even a switch light. Presently two staccato blasts broke from the engine's whistle, there was a progressive jerking at coupling pins, which started up at the big locomotive and ran rapidly {{down the length of the}} train, there was the squeaking of brake shoes against wheels, and the train moved slowly forward again upon its long journey toward the coast, gaining momentum moment by moment until finally the way-car rolled rapidly past the hidden fugitive and the freight rumbled away to be swallowed up in the darkness.|$|R
60|$|I {{have never}} seen such a sea. All the time there blew across the land one of those stiff and {{throttling}} winds that one can lean up against like a wall. One expected anything to be blown out of shape at any instant; the lamp-post to be snapped like a green stalk, the tree to be whirled away like a straw. I myself should certainly have been blown out of shape if I had possessed any shape to be blown out of; for I walked along the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the stone <b>embankment</b> above the black and battering sea and could not rid myself of the idea that it was an invasion of England. But as I walked along this edge I was somewhat surprised to find that as I neared a certain spot another noise mingled with the ceaseless cannonade of the sea.|$|R

'Strange,' Ronald Le Breton {{thought to}} himself, {{as he walked}} along the Embankment between Westminster and Waterloo, some weeks later--the day of Herr Max's trial,--'I {{had a sort of}} impulse to come down here alone this afternoon: I felt as if there was an unseen Hand somehow impelling me. Depend upon it, one doesn't have {{instincts}} of that sort utterly for nothing. The Finger that guides us guides us always aright for its own wise and unfathomable purposes. What a blessing and a comfort it is to feel that one's steps are continually directed from above, and that even an afternoon stroll through the great dreary town is appointed to us for some fit and sufficient reason! Look at that poor girl over there now, at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Embankment!</b> I wonder what on earth she can have come here for. Why...how pale and excited she looks. What's she going so near the edge for? Gracious heavens! it can't be...yes...it is... no, no, but still it must be...that's what the Finger was guiding me here for this afternoon. There's no denying it. The poor creature's tempted to destroy herself. My instinct tells me so at once, and it never tells me wrong. Oh, Inscrutable Wisdom, help me, help me: give me light to act rightly! I must go up this very moment and speak to her!' ...|$|R
500|$|During {{the night}} of 27/28 March, patrols of the 47th Battalion had {{observed}} German troops on the Albert–Dernancourt road, on the open flats just [...] across the railway line, but the night passed without obvious signs of attack. Early in the morning, the German artillery fell heavily on the support lines and rear area, but initially was very light along the railway line. In the thick mist of early dawn, the commander of a small post of the 47th Battalion, stationed behind the <b>embankment</b> immediately north <b>of</b> the level crossing, {{heard the sound of}} bayonet scabbards flapping on the thighs of marching troops. Sergeant Stanley McDougall woke his comrades and they ran to alert nearby elements of the battalion. McDougall, running along the top <b>of</b> the <b>embankment,</b> saw German troops of II/229 RIR advancing along the whole front through the mist. Returning with a handful of men, he planned to deploy them behind the ungarrisoned bank to the south. By this time, Germans were throwing hand grenades over the embankment, and one exploded near a Lewis machine gun team in front of McDougall, badly wounding the two man crew. McDougall, who had previously been a Lewis gunner, grabbed the gun and began to fire it from the hip as he went. First he shot down two German light machine gun teams as they tried to cross the rails, then, running along the enemy <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>embankment,</b> saw about 20 Germans waiting for the signal to assault. He hosed them down with the gun, then as they ran, followed them with its fire. By this time, several of his comrades had been killed or wounded.|$|R

50|$|On 6 August 1996, Kidd was {{involved}} in a serious motorcycle accident while performing at the Bulldog Bash, held at Long Marston Airfield near Stratford-upon-Avon. In comparison to some of his previous stunts, the jump Kidd made that day was relatively minor, comprising a jump of approximately 15 m across a drag strip. The relatively short landing area beyond the drag strip consisted of an uphill incline leading to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a steep <b>embankment.</b> Although Kidd completed the jump and landed the bike upright on two wheels, his chin struck the petrol tank of his motorcycle and he was knocked unconscious. As a result, Kidd was unable to prevent himself and his bike from continuing up and over the 6 m embankment edge. Kidd sustained serious head and pelvic injuries in the resulting fall. After the accident, doctors told Kidd's parents that it was possible he could be in a coma for up to 10 years. However, he regained consciousness within three months of the accident, but was left paralysed and with brain damage.|$|R
40|$|Application of vacuum {{assisted}} preloading is an imperative method when {{a considerable}} load {{is required to}} meet the desired rate of settlement {{and an increase in}} the undrained shear strength upon consolidation. Moreover, where lateral displacements at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a coastal <b>embankment</b> need to be controlled, application of vacuum pressure with a cut off offers the optimum solution. To facilitate vacuum propagation, vertical drains are usually employed in conjunction. The installation of vertical drains using a steel mandrel creates significant remoulding of the subsoil surrounding the drains thereby, reducing soil permeability and adversely affecting the soil consolidation process. In this paper, the simulation of vacuum assisted consolidation using the spectral method and finite element analysis is carried out. Subsequently, the 2 D and 3 D numerical multi-drain analyses are conducted to predict the excess pore pressures, lateral and vertical displacements. The performance of two selected case histories at the sites of Suvarnabhumi Airport, Thailand and Tianjin Port, China are discussed and analysed. The numerical predictions are then compared with the available field data. Finally, a procedure for the design of vertical drains is presente...|$|R
