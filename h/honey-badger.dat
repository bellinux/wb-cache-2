5000|$|European {{traders and}} missionaries {{were the first}} {{recorded}} people who travelled through the area of Namibia that now contains Erindi, probably from Walvis Bay northwards {{in the direction of}} Ovamboland in the mid-1800s. [...] But evidence shows that other people used to inhabit this land such as the indigenous Herero and San tribes. There are signs of seasonal Herero farmers having moved through the area, as well as significant San rock paintings and engravings on “Big Bushman” Mountain. In 1986, the Joubert brothers bought the land from the Imperial Cold Storage and Supply Company (ICS). They were determined {{to turn it into a}} model cattle farm, so they invested money, time and energy into the project. By the early 1990s, the brothers realized that to increase overall profitability of the farm, they would need to gradually start stocking the farm with game. Natural food resources was a major concern, so to avoid competition with the cattle, they introduced plains game. They fenced 3 000 hectares and put 55 giraffe on it in 1992. This was a noticeably successful venture, so more game such as the Blue Wildebeest and African Elephant were brought in from Etosha National Park. The farm was already home to wild animals like the Gemsbok, Kudu, Leopard, Cheetah, <b>Honey-Badger,</b> Baboon and many others.|$|E
40|$|Russia {{and states}} of CIS arc in progress. On {{a total of}} 640 {{publications}} examined, the otter (428) and the European mink (195) were the most studied species, the Steppe and Marbled polccats (89 and 83 entries), and <b>Honey-badger</b> (24) were less considered. Titles written in national languages dominate, but a recent increase in the ratio of publications written or summarized i n English or German was noted. Based on number and profile of publications, i t is suggested that conservation of European mink requires more efforts and research...|$|E
5000|$|There {{exists a}} mutualistic {{relationship}} between the honey-guide bird and humans: {{in order to obtain}} wax, the bird guides people (and, according to popular legend, <b>honey-badgers,</b> although the relationship between honey-guides and honey badgers has since been called into question) to the nests of wild bees. The Hadza honey hunter, typically a man, will engage in a whistle [...] "dialogue" [...] between himself and the honey-guide bird. [...] The hunter and the bird communicate back and forth, via this series of chatters and whistles, until the bird guides the Hadza man to the hive. Once they have located the hive, the honey hunter hammers pegs into the tree, climbs to the hive (which can be located thirty feet up the trunk of the tree), uses his axe to chop into the tree to uncover the hive, smokes the bees in order to pacify them, and retrieves the honey comb. The Hadza honey hunter consumes the liquid honey and larvae while the honey guide bird consumes the wax and the bees. The role of the honey-guide is reflected also in Hadza mythology, both in naturalistic and personified forms. Honey represents {{a substantial portion of the}} Hadza diet and this reliance on honey (as well as larvae and bee pollen), exemplified by the Hadza, may have a long and rich history in human evolution.|$|R
40|$|Southern Africa {{is renowned}} for its wealth of animal life both in numbers and variety. Antelope in countless herds once roamed the plains, while the large mammals, the {{so-called}} big game, have drawn hunters to this continent {{from all over the}} world. Selected wildlife products such as ivory, rhino horn and skins have been articles of trade for centuries. But far more important, zoologically, is the fact that in this region representative of 51 families of mammals occurs, a greater variety than {{are to be found in}} any other zoo-geographical region. These are all placental mammals, and no monotremes or marsupials are bound here. The region is also characterized by the absence of bears, true deer, wild sheep* and goats. Another striking feature is that no less than 12 families are endemic, the most characteristic of which are the hoofed mammals. The antelopes from the major group of herbivorous mammals and probably the most remarkable component of the fauna of this region, numbering at least 30 species and ranging from the large eland (Taurotragus oryx) measuring two m at the shoulder and weighing 700 kg, to the diminutive and delicately built blue duiker (Cephalophus monticola). Although horses do not occur in the wild state, the fossilized remains of a true horse (Equus capensis) have been recorded. The family is, however, well represented by at least four species of zebra. From the viewpoint of this paper, however, the carnivores are the most important order and are also particularly well represented; in fact, the lion may be regarded as symbolic of the sub-continent. Representatives of the order include the civets, genets, mongooses, and meerkats; the <b>honey-badger,</b> otters, and weasels; the dog family such as jackals and hyenas; the large cat family, and that peculiar animal, the aardwolf (Proteles cristatus), which is endemic...|$|E
