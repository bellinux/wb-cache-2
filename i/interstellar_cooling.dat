The mass of cooled gas must be spatially distributed since it greatly exceeds the masses of central black holes. We explore here the proposition that a population of low mass, optically dark stars is created from the cooled gas. We consider a wide variety of radial distributions for the <b>interstellar</b> <b>cooling,</b> but only a few are consistent with observed X-ray surface brightness profiles. In a region of concentrated <b>interstellar</b> <b>cooling,</b> the X-ray emission can exceed that observed, suggesting the presence of additional support by magnetic stresses or non-thermal pressure. In general we find that the mass of cooled gas contributes significantly to stellar dynamical mass to light ratios which vary with galactic radius. If the stars formed from cooled interstellar gas are optically luminous, their influence on the the mass to light ratio would be reduced. The mass of cooled gas inside r_e is sensitive to the rate that old stars lose mass, which is nearly independent of the initial mass function of the old stellar population.

Parameters that give the best fits to the X-ray observations of NGC 4472 are used as a template for the radial distribution of <b>interstellar</b> <b>cooling</b> in structurally homologous elliptical galaxies of lower mass. Gas that cools within an effective radius can contribute an additional 10 - 30 percent to {{the mass of the}} old stellar population. If the cooled gas forms into stars of very low mass, ≪ M_, as is commonly assumed, the cooled mass is optically dark. As a result, the mass to light ratios determined from stellar velocities systematically overestimate that of the old stellar population. Moreover, the total mass and spatial distribution of the optically dark young stellar population does not scale homologously with galactic luminosity or radius and the total stellar mass to light ratio varies with galactic radius. We investigate the non-homologous perturbations of cooled gas on the mass to light ratio for several idealized homologous elliptical galaxies and show that they appear to be incompatible with the observed thinness of the fundamental plane. If optically luminous young stars formed from the cooled gas, the disturbance of the fundamental plane would be lessened. Comment: 10 pages with 2 figures; accepted by Astrophysical Journa...|$|E

We propose that these clouds are formed by the interaction of a jet with interstellar neutral hydrogen (HI) clumps. By studying the dependence of the shape of dense cold clouds formed by shock compression and cooling on the filling factor of HI clumps, we found that the density distribution of HI clumps determines the shape of molecular clouds formed by the jet-cloud interaction; arc-clouds are formed when the filling factor is large. On the other hand, when the filling factor is small, molecular clouds align with the jet. The jet propagates faster in models with small filling factors.

40|$|Interstellar {{magnetic}} fields in elliptical galaxies {{have their origin in}} stellar fields that accompany normal mass loss from an evolving population of old stars. It {{is likely that}} these seed fields are amplified by interstellar turbulence which in turn is driven by stellar mass loss and supernova events. Since the local turbulent velocity is likely to exceed the global velocity of the <b>interstellar</b> <b>cooling</b> flow, {{magnetic fields}} are expected to be disordered and this is indicated by numerous observations. Further amplification occurs as these tangled fields are compressed in the inward moving cooling flow of the interstellar gas. Near the centers of galactic cooling flows, where the gas radiates away most of its thermal and gravitational energy, magnetic stresses are expected to dominate. We study here the time-dependent growth of interstellar magnetic fields in elliptical galaxies and demonstrate that fields similar in strength to those observed can be generated solely from natural galactic processes.

40|$|We explore {{here the}} {{possibly}} important influence of cooled interstellar gas on the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies. <b>Interstellar</b> <b>cooling</b> {{is described by}} a parameterized sink term in the equation of continuity. Parameters that give the best fits to the X-ray observations of elliptical galaxy NGC 4472 are used as a template for other galaxies. These spatially-dependent cooling parameters are then extended homologously to elliptical galaxies of lower mass for which X-ray observations are currently unavailable or impossible to observe because of stronger relative X-ray emission from binary stars. Most of the interstellar gas cools within an effective radius where it can contribute an additional 10 - 30 percent to {{the mass of the}} old stellar population. The absence of observed cooled gas and simple theoretical arguments support the hypothesis that the cooled gas is forming into low mass stars, with implications that depend on the IMF of this young stellar population. If the IMF includes only stars of very low mass, ≪ M ⊙ as is commonly believed, the cooled mass is optically dark. For this IMF the mass to light ratios determined from stellar velocities systematically overestimate that of the old stellar population.

40|$|Supersonic {{turbulence}} in {{the interstellar}} medium (ISM) is believed to decay rapidly within a flow crossing time irrespective {{of the degree of}} magnetization. However, this general consensus of decaying magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence relies on local isothermal simulations, which are unable {{to take into account the}} roles of global structures of magnetic fields and the ISM. Utilizing three-dimensional MHD simulations including <b>interstellar</b> <b>cooling</b> and heating, we investigate decaying MHD turbulence within cold neutral medium sheets embedded in warm neutral medium. Early evolution of turbulent kinetic energy is consistent with previous results for decaying compressible MHD turbulence characterized by rapid energy decay with a power-law form of E∝ t^- 1 and by short decay time compared to a flow crossing time. If initial magnetic fields are strong and perpendicular to the sheet, however, long-term evolution of the kinetic energy shows that a significant amount of turbulent energy (∼ 0. 2 E_ 0) still remains even after ten flow crossing times for models with periodic boundary conditions. The decay rate is also greatly reduced as the field strength increases for such initial and boundary conditions, but not if the boundary conditions are that for a completely isolated sheet. We analyze velocity power spectra of the remaining turbulence to show that in-plane, incompressible motions parallel to the sheet dominate at later times. Comment: 31 pages, 9 figures.

40|$|Galactic spiral shocks are {{dominant}} morphological {{features and}} {{believed to be}} responsible for substructure formation within spiral arms in disk galaxies. They can also contribute a substantial amount of kinetic energy to the interstellar gas by tapping the (differential) rotational motion. We use numerical hydrodynamic simulations to investigate dynamics and structure of spiral shocks with thermal instability (TI) in vertically stratified galactic disks, focusing on environmental conditions (of heating and the galactic potential) similar to the Solar neighborhood. We initially consider an isothermal disk in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and let it evolve subject to <b>interstellar</b> <b>cooling</b> and heating as well as a stellar spiral potential. Due to TI, a disk with surface density Σ 0 � 6. 7 M ⊙ pc − 2 rapidly turns to a thin dense slab near the midplane sandwiched between layers of rarefied gas. The imposed spiral potential leads to a vertically curved shock that exhibits strong flapping motions in the plane perpendicular to the arm. The overall flow structure at saturation is comprised of the arm, postshock expansion zone, and interarm regions that occupy typically 10 %, 20 %, and 70 % of the arm-to-arm distance, in which the gas resides for 15 %, 30 %, and 55 % of the arm-to-arm crossing time, respectively.

40|$|Typically ∼ 5 {{percent of}} the total baryonic mass in {{luminous}} elliptical galaxies {{is in the form of}} cooled interstellar gas. Although the mass contributed by cooled gas is small relative to the mass of the old stellar system in these galaxies, it is almost certainly concentrated within the optical effective radius where it can influence the local dynamical mass. However, the mass of cooled gas cannot be confined to very small galactic radii (r < ∼ 0. 01 re) since its mass would greatly exceed that of known central mass concentrations in giant ellipticals, normally attributed to massive black holes. We explore the proposition that a population of very low mass, optically dark stars is created from the cooled gas. For a wide variety of assumed radial distributions for the <b>interstellar</b> <b>cooling,</b> we find that the mass of cooled gas contributes significantly (∼ 30 percent) to stellar dynamical mass to light ratios which, as a result, are expected to vary with galactic radius.

Cooling mass dropout also perturbs the local apparent X-ray surface brightness distribution, often in a positive sense for centrally concentrated cooling. In general the computed X-ray surface brightness exceeds observed values within re, suggesting the presence of additional support by magnetic stresses or non-thermal pressure.

40|$|Shortened version: The fate of IS clouds {{embedded}} in a hot tenuous medium depends on whether the clouds suffer from evaporation or whether material condensates onto them. Analytical solutions for the rate of evaporative mass loss from an isolated spherical cloud {{embedded in}} a hot tenuous gas are deduced by Cowie & McKee (1977). In order to test {{the validity of the}} analytical results for more realistic IS conditions the full hydrodynamical equations must be treated. Therefore, 2 D numerical simulations of the evolution of IS clouds %are performed with different internal density structures and surrounded by a hot plasma reservoir. Self-gravity, <b>interstellar</b> heating and <b>cooling</b> effects and heat conduction by electrons are added. Classical thermal conductivity of a fully ionized hydrogen plasma and saturated heat flux are considered. Using pure hydrodynamics and classical heat flux we can reproduce the analytical results. Heat flux saturation reduces the evaporation rate by one order of magnitude below the analytical value. The evolution changes totally for more realistic conditions when <b>interstellar</b> heating and <b>cooling</b> effects stabilize the self-gravity. Evaporation then turns into condensation, because the additional energy by heat conduction can be transported away from the interface and radiated off efficiently from the cloud's inner parts.
