5|$|Meanwhile, Ed {{is fired}} via telephone. He hears the same voice as before and yells {{at the woman}} living below him, {{thinking}} it was her. Upon hearing the voice after a pair of Jehovah's Witnesses stop by, Ed goes downstairs and murders his neighbor, throwing her body in the furnace. When her voice talks to him again, Jerse realizes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> from his new tattoo. Scully heads to Philadelphia and watches Pudovkin enter a tattoo parlor. Inside, she sees Ed arguing with the owner, wanting the tattoo removed. Ed strikes {{up a conversation with}} Scully and invites her out to dinner, which she initially declines.|$|E
25|$|The above formula {{assumes that}} the source is either {{directly}} approaching or receding from the observer. If the source approaches the observer at an angle (but still with a constant velocity), the observed frequency that is first heard {{is higher than the}} object's emitted frequency. Thereafter, there is a monotonic decrease in the observed frequency as it gets closer to the observer, through equality when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> from a direction perpendicular to the relative motion (and was emitted at the point of closest approach; but when the wave is received, the source and observer will no longer be at their closest), and a continued monotonic decrease as it recedes from the observer. When the observer is very close to the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is very abrupt. When the observer is far from the path of the object, the transition from high to low frequency is gradual.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{there came}} to her keen ears another sound. Something {{approached}} her along {{the rim of the}} gorge. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> from above. She halted, listening. Perhaps <b>it</b> <b>was</b> her father, or a brother. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> closer. She strained her eyes through the darkness. She did not move--she scarcely breathed. And then, of a sudden, quite close it seemed, there blazed through the black night two yellow-green spots of fire.|$|R

500|$|I {{came in with}} Halley's comet in 1835. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> {{again next}} year, and I expect {{to go out with}} it. It will be the {{greatest}} disappointment of my life if I don't go out with Halley's comet. The Almighty has said, no doubt: 'Now here are these two unaccountable freaks; they came in together, they must go out together.' ...|$|E
500|$|Hearing {{a terrible}} noise in her dwellings, Gerðr asks where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> from, {{noting that the}} earth trembles and that all of Gymir's courts shake. A serving maid (unnamed) notes that outside a man has {{dismounted}} his horse and has let it graze. Gerðr tells the serving maid to invite the man to come into their hall and to partake {{of some of their}} [...] "famous mead," [...] yet Gerðr expresses fear that the man outside may be her [...] "brother's slayer".|$|E
500|$|... "The Raven" [...] follows {{an unnamed}} narrator on a dreary night in December who sits reading [...] "forgotten lore" [...] by a dying fire [...] {{as a way}} to forget the death of his beloved Lenore. A [...] "tapping at [...] chamber door" [...] reveals nothing, but excites his soul to [...] "burning". The tapping is repeated, {{slightly}} louder, and he realizes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> from his window. When he goes to investigate, a raven flutters into his chamber. Paying no attention to the man, the raven perches on a bust of Pallas above the door.|$|E

500|$|The Fringe team {{comes on}} the scene to {{investigate}} and find the boy's photograph, along with recorded sightings of deformed people going back 30 years. They arrive in Edina, the city these sightings occurred near, and Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) hears a buzz called the [...] "Edina hum". The sheriff explains <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> from a nearby military base and offers to show them case files of past sightings. While driving, the SUV containing Olivia, Peter (Joshua Jackson), and Walter (John Noble) is run off the road by another vehicle, whose driver then starts shooting at them before getting shot and leaving. The FBI find the abandoned vehicle and follow a blood trail to the shooter. Peter is visibly disturbed after killing his first person, and Olivia tries to comfort him.|$|E
500|$|... "Welcome to the Occupation" [...] {{is about}} a teacher limited with his career who strives to be an artist. Willett was {{inspired}} by his job as an English high school teacher in Torrance to write the song, saying that it didn't give him [...] "a lot of creative space to really be very inspired to be a teacher." [...] "Golden Gate Jumpers" [...] {{is about a}} woman who goes to the Golden Gate Bridge and contemplates taking her life away. The tracks [...] "Avalanche in B" [...] and [...] "I've Seen Enough" [...] were originally conceived by the band as one-long track but instead cut into two songs. The former uses snow as a metaphor for how bleak and empty life is when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> straight towards you. The latter was created during a jam session in which the band played one continuous chord progression that stuck with them throughout the session. [...] "Every Man I Fall For" [...] is about a woman's perspective on relationships. Inspired by his own mother's relationship with men, Willett saw something he could craft from that emotion, saying that it stuck with him as having importance [...] "because it was something I always saw in relationships; like my mom being a single mother and seeing how men treat these women and how they operate in relationships." ...|$|E
500|$|... "New Rules" [...] {{was written}} by Caroline Ailin, Emily Warren and its {{producer}} Ian Kirkpatrick, and was included on Dua Lipa's eponymous debut studio album in 2017. Lipa worked on the record during three years, stating that the extended process led to her writing and recording songs until {{she felt she had}} a considerable amount to pick from. When asked what it was like working with younger artists like Lipa and Noah Cyrus, Warren stated that they both were [...] "older souls" [...] and that she helped them to express what they wanted to say. [...] "In both cases they were pretty comfortable telling those stories. [...] end up being true to each artist because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> from their story, too," [...] Warren said. Kirkpatrick also engineered and programmed the track, while Chris Gehringer mastered it and Josh Gudwin mixed it. Talking about the song, the artist explained that [...] "'New Rules' is quite different to a lot of tracks on the album. I wanted it to feel very new [...] It's the breakup song that I wish I had when I was breaking up with someone" [...] and that [...] "It's about keeping your distance from someone who's bad for you. I'm setting some rules down so [...] won't go back to that person." [...] "New Rules" [...] was sent to contemporary hit radio in the United Kingdom on 21 July 2017 as the album's sixth single. It impacted the same format in the United States on 22 August 2017. Three days later, a remixed version by Australian DJ Alison Wonderland was released on iTunes.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{conversation}} with Whittle after the war, Von Ohain stated that [...] "If you {{had been given the}} money you would have been six years ahead of us.

2500|$|While {{emphasizing}} unity {{within the}} Muslim community, Warith Deen Mohammed called upon the American Muslim community {{to establish a}} new school of fiqh, a code of conduct for the observance of rituals, morals and social legislation in Islam. He told ISLAMICA magazine in 2008 that he felt that the madhhab—the schools of thought within fiqh—were geographically influenced and should be regionally developed, suggesting that [...] "I think we are gradually getting a sense of madhabs in America, especially those like me. We are getting a sense of madhabs. And with the coming generation I think that we will be getting a much stronger sense of it. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> more and more." ...|$|E
