5000|$|A junk head {{is a form}} of {{piston engine}} {{cylinder}} head, where the head is formed by a <b>dummy</b> <b>piston</b> mounted inside the top of the cylinder. In most other engine designs, the cylinder head is mounted on top of the cylinder block. That form has also been termed a [...] "poultice head".|$|E
50|$|The moving steam imparts both a {{tangential}} and {{axial thrust}} on the turbine shaft, but the axial thrust {{in a simple}} turbine is unopposed. To maintain the correct rotor position and balancing, this force must be counteracted by an opposing force. Thrust bearings {{can be used for}} the shaft bearings, the rotor can use <b>dummy</b> <b>pistons,</b> it can be double flow- the steam enters {{in the middle of the}} shaft and exits at both ends, or a combination of any of these. In a double flow rotor, the blades in each half face opposite ways, so that the axial forces negate each other but the tangential forces act together. This design of rotor is also called two-flow, double-axial-flow, or double-exhaust. This arrangement is common in low-pressure casings of a compound turbine.|$|R
