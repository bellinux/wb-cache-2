2500|$|Day's {{argument}} {{was characterized by}} the Court as relying primarily on Habeas Rule 4, which requires district courts to [...] "promptly examine" [...] petitions and dismiss [...] "if it plainly appears...that the petitioner is not entitled to relief." [...] Day argued that this limited a court's ability to raise AEDPA's limitation sua sponte to the preanswer, initial screening stage, and that after that point, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governed the proceedings. [...] Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c), {{the statute of limitations}} defense is forfeited if it is not asserted in its answer, or an amendment thereto, just as the State of Florida failed to do. [...] However, the Court believed that were it to accept Day's position, courts would rarely be positioned to raise AEDPA's time bar sua sponte because <b>information</b> <b>essential</b> to the time calculation is often absent until the State has filed, along with its answer, copies of documents from the state-court proceedings, {{as was the case in}} Day's proceedings.|$|E
