25|$|In 1915, Giovanni Pastrone {{decided to}} launch Menichelli {{as a film}} star, and gave her the lead role in Il Fuoco (The Fire), which was a global popular and {{critical}} success. This acclaim catapulted Menichelli {{into the ranks of}} the lavishly-paid cinema divas, such as Francesca Bertini and Lyda Borelli. The film bore no <b>formal</b> <b>relation</b> to Gabriele d'Annunzio's novel of the same name, and was developed from a screenplay by Febo Mari, Menichelli's co-star. However, the film was full of d'Annunzian themes of violent passion, power and decadence. The film is divided into three parts: La Favilla (the spark), La Vampa (the flame/blaze) and Il Cenere (the ashes), which correspond with the three phases of the relationship between Menichelli's aristocratic poet and Mari's impoverished painter. The original poster for Il Fuoco depicts a key moment in the film. Menichelli's character knocks over an oil lamp, and asks Mari's character to choose between love and all-consuming passion, and he chooses the latter. Menichelli's feathered hat, long capes and fierece gestures make her seem like an owl and reinforce one of the film's motifs; the link between the femme fatale and birds of prey. Menichelli earned the nickname 'Our Lady of Spasms' for her abrupt gestures in this film.|$|E

I went to visit some people at Kensington: Ophy Butler's wife(9) there lies very ill of an ague, which is a very common disease here, and little known in Ireland. I am apt to think we shall soon have a peace, by the little words I hear thrown out by the Ministry. I have just thought of a project to bite the town.

5000|$|Since {{the pioneer}} efforts of Frisch in the 1920s, {{one of the}} major issues which has pervaded the theory of {{preferences}} is the representability of a preference structure with a real-valued function.

Von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944 book [...] "Games and Economic Behaviour" [...] treated preferences as a <b>formal</b> <b>relation</b> whose properties can be stated axiomatically. These type of axiomatic handling of preferences soon began to influence other economists: Marschak adopted it by 1950, Houthakker employed it in a 1950 paper, and Kenneth Arrow perfected it in his 1951 book [...] "Social Choice and Individual Values".|$|E

50|$|A more lasting {{result of}} this <b>formal</b> <b>relation</b> was that Edward I and other Miskito rulers who {{followed}} him allowed the British to establish settlements and plantations within his realm, and issued the first land grants to this effect in 1742.

The British plantation owners used their estates to grow some export crops and as bases for the exploitation of timber resources, especially mahogany. Most of the labor on the estates was supplied by African slaves and by indigenous slaves captured in Miskito and British raids into Spanish territory. By 1786, there were several hundred British residents on the shore and several thousands slaves, mostly African.|$|E

40|$|Coordination {{languages}} simplify {{design and}} development of concurrent systems. Particularly, exogenous coordination languages, like BIP and Reo, enable system designers to express the interactions among components in a system explicitly. In this paper we establish a <b>formal</b> <b>relation</b> between BI(P) (i. e., BIP without the priority layer) and Reo, by defining transformations between their semantic models. We show that these transformations preserve all properties expressible in a common semantics. This <b>formal</b> <b>relation</b> comprises {{the basis for a}} solid comparison and consolidation of the fundamental coordination concepts behind these two languages. Moreover, this basis offers translations that enable users of either language to benefit from the toolchains of the other. Comment: In Proceedings ICE 2015, arXiv: 1508. 0459...|$|E
