Alternatively, some of the main characteristics of the disorder, which consist of recurring intrusion feelings, an inability to resist the urge to steal, and a release of pressure following the theft, suggest that kleptomania could be an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder. Persons diagnosed with kleptomania usually gain satisfaction after his stolen activity was done. This study is a qualitative-phenomenological study. Two men involved in the study; both subjects had been encountered an impulse disorder for years. The results showed that both subjects made plans before they stole things.

50|$|Psycho-logic defense—In both sexes, <b>defense</b> <b>mechanisms</b> provide {{transitory}} {{resolutions of}} {{the conflict between the}} drives of the id and the drives of the <b>ego.</b> The first <b>defense</b> <b>mechanism</b> is repression, the blocking of memories, emotional impulses, and ideas from the conscious mind; yet its action does not resolve the id-ego conflict. The second <b>defense</b> <b>mechanism</b> is identification, in which the boy or girl child adapts by incorporating, to his or her (super)ego, the personality characteristics of the same-sex parent. As a result of this, the boy diminishes his castration anxiety, because his likeness to father protects him from father's wrath in their maternal rivalry. In the case of the girl, this facilitates identifying with mother, who understands that, in being females, neither of them possesses a penis, and thus are not antagonists.|$|R
