500|$|A {{few years}} after {{attaining}} commercial success from songs such as [...] "I Walk the Line", [...] "Understand Your Man", and [...] "Ring of Fire", Cash's popularity waned. This was {{due in part to}} his increasing <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>drugs.</b> In 1967, Cash sought help for his escalating drug problems; {{by the end of the}} year, his drug use decreased and he sought to turn his career around. Concurrently, the country portion of Columbia Records underwent major personnel changes. Frank Jones and Don Law, who had produced several of Cash's albums, were ousted in favor of Bob Johnston, who was known for his erratic behavior and willingness to disagree with studio executives. Cash saw this as an opportunity to pitch his idea of recording a live album at a prison; Johnston enthusiastically supported the concept. Johnston called San Quentin State Prison and Folsom, with Folsom being the first to respond.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{lipophilic}} cation [Au(I) (dppe) 2]+ [where dppe is 1, 2 -bis(diphenylphosphino) ethane] {{has previously}} demonstrated potent in vitro antitumour activity. We wished {{to determine the}} physicochemical basis for the cellular uptake of this drug, {{as well as of}} analogues including the 1 : 2 adducts of Au(I) with 1, 2 -bis(di-n-pyridylphosphino) ethane (dnpype; n= 2, 3 and 4), and to compare in vitro and in vivo antitumour activity. Methods and results: Logarithmic IC 50 values for the CH- 1 cell line bore a parabolic <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>drug</b> lipophilicity, as measured either by high-performance liquid chromatography or by n-octanol-water partition. Cellular uptake of drug, as measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, varied by over three orders of magnitude over the series. Logarithmic uptake had a parabolic <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>drug</b> lipophilicity but a linear relationship to logarithmic IC 50 values. Free drug concentrations were determined under the culture conditions and logarithmic free drug IC 50 values and uptake rates were linearly related to lipophilicity. Uptake of drug in vivo in tissue from murine colon? 38 tumours was approximately proportional to the dose administered. Host toxicity varied according to lipophilicity with the most selective compound having an intermediate value. This compound was also the most active of those tested in vivo, giving a growth delay of 9 ?days following daily intraperitoneal dosing (10 ?days) at 4 ?孯l?kg- 1 ?day- 1. It was also significantly more active than another lipophilic cation, MKT- 077. Conclusions: Alteration of lipophilicity of aromatic cationic antitumour drugs greatly affects cellular uptake and binding to plasma proteins. Changes in lipophilicity also affect host toxicity, and optimal lipophilicity may be a critical factor in the design of analogues with high antitumour activity. No Full Tex...|$|R

50|$|Amphetamine {{dependence}} {{refers to}} a state of psychological <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> a <b>drug</b> in the amphetamine class. In individuals with substance use disorder (problematic use or abuse with dependence), psychotherapy is currently the best treatment option as no pharmacological treatment has been approved. Tolerance is expected to develop with regular substituted amphetamine use. When substituted amphetamines are abused, drug tolerance develops rapidly.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present an evaluation of the potential for abuse of and <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> a <b>drug</b> from the data obtained from the different pharmacoepidemiological tools used by the French network for evaluation and information on pharmacodependence and addiction monitoring taking the example of tramadol. Comparison of the data from spontaneous reports with surveys in specific populations and with evaluations of indicators of diverted uses does not highlight a major pro-blem of tramadol abuse and dependence in terms of public health, but stresses the importance of paying attention to the signal. This example of addiction monitoring of tramadol illustrates the interest of comparing results obtained from different validated sources. The implementation of repeated observational programs of abuse of and <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> psychoactive <b>drugs</b> is an important aid to health authorities to define the content of the information to be delivered or regulatory decisions to reduce these problematic uses.

40|$|Cultures of tetracycline-treated Staphylococcus aureus {{exhibited}} monophasic steady-state {{growth curves}} {{similar to that}} observed for tetracycline-treated Escherichia coli. Apparent growth rate constants of the respective drug-treated cultures showed the same formal <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>drug</b> concentration, which was linear at a low concentration but asymptotically approached zero at higher concentration levels and implied the saturation of {{a limited number of}} receptor sites engaged in microbial protein synthesis. The relative potency of tetracycline action of S. aureus/E. coli was 6. 50 : 1 at 37. 5 °C and pH 7. 05. This is attributed to relative differences in drug permeation and/or binding affinity for biophase receptors in the respective organisms. It is concluded from kinetic dependencies of growth inhibition of the cultures that tetracycline has the same mode of action on S. aureus and E. coli. It is bacteriostatic at concentrations below the minimal inhibitory concentration level but bactericidal at the higher concentration levels...|$|R

40|$|Inhibition of the {{steady-state}} {{generation of}} Escherichia coli by the bacteriostatic antibiotic novobiocin is linearly related to drug {{concentration in the}} range of 0 to 30 μg/ml. Increased cell sizes result because the drug inhibits cell division. The generation rate <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>drug</b> concentration depends <b>on</b> the nonionized fraction of novobiocin and is invariant with inoculum size or medium composition. However, the antibacterial activity of novobiocin decreases as the concentration of nutrients and Mg 2 + increases, although the inhibitory action of novobiocin on generation rate remains unchanged for concentrations of Mg 2 + above 8. 1 × 10 − 4 M. Novobiocin is synergistic in combinations with tetracycline in broth, but not when the Mg 2 + was maintained at 4. 05 × 10 − 3 M. Combinations of novobiocin with the 50 S ribosomal subunit inhibitors chloramphenicol, erythromycin, or lincomycin are antagonistic, and the degree of growth inhibition is determined only by that component of the binary combination that would have the greater potency if it were acting alone...|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} inhibiting {{the breakdown of}} endogenous opioid peptides rather than stimulating opioid receptors with exogenous drugs is that the levels of opioid peptides are only increased slightly from natural levels, thus avoiding overstimulation and downregulation of the opioid receptors. This means that even when RB-101 is used in high doses for extended periods of time, there is no development of <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> the <b>drug</b> or tolerance to its analgesic effects. Consequently, even though RB-101 is able to produce potent analgesic effects via the opioid system, {{it is unlikely to}} be addictive.|$|R
