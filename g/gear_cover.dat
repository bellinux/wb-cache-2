500|$|The B-1A's {{engine was}} {{modified}} slightly {{to produce the}} GE F101-102 for the B-1B, {{with an emphasis on}} durability, and increased efficiency. The core of this engine has since been re-used in several other engine designs, including the GE F110 which has seen use in the F-14 Tomcat, F-15K/SG variants and most recent versions of the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. It is also the basis for the non-afterburning GE F118 used in the B-2 Spirit and the U-2S. [...] The F101 engine was the basis for the core of the extremely popular CFM56 civil engine, which can be found on some versions of practically every small-to-medium-sized airliner. The nose <b>gear</b> <b>cover</b> door has controls for the auxiliary power units (APUs), which allow for quick starts of the APUs upon order to scramble.|$|E
50|$|Locomotive number 03 154 was {{equipped}} with a parabolic smokebox door, a tapered driver's cab and driving <b>gear</b> <b>cover</b> plates. Number 03 193 was given a wine-red, streamlined, full covering and a 2′3 T 37 St tender, in order to replace the Class 05. 03 204 and 03 205 had driving <b>gear</b> <b>cover</b> plates for experimental purposes. Locomotive numbers 03 175 and 03 207 had Lentz valve gear, also as an experiment.|$|E
5000|$|On 19 January 2010, PSA Airlines Canadair CRJ-200 N246PS overran {{the runway}} at Yeager Airport, Charleston, West Virginia {{following}} an aborted take-off. The aircraft {{was stopped by}} the EMAS {{at the end of}} the runway, sustaining minor damage to its undercarriage. The information in the referenced article regarding [...] "substantial" [...] damage was premature and inaccurate. The aircraft was flown away within days of the incident after removal of a damaged landing <b>gear</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E

50|$|Fortunately, one {{advantage}} the {{drive on the}} BL2 locomotives model, {{was the fact that}} the trucks and worm <b>gears</b> <b>covers</b> were exposed. This made it easy to handle the above described problems. On latter models, these parts were encased in a massive weight which had to be removed. Getting this weight out required several screws to be removed, some hidden under the fuel tank. The weight also guided the wires around the locomotive. This made dissembling the locomotive for maintenance difficult and frustrating.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{generation}} 1JZ-GTE employs twin CT12A turbochargers arranged in parallel and blowing through a side-mount or front mount air-to-air intercooler. With an 8.5:1 static compression ratio, the factory quoted {{power and torque}} outputs are [...] at 6200 rpm and 363 Nm at 4800 rpm. The bore and stroke {{are the same as}} for the 1JZ-GE: 86 mm bore × 71.5 mm stroke. Yamaha may have had a hand in the development or production of these engines (possibly the head design), hence the Yamaha badging on certain parts of the engine, such as the cam <b>gear</b> <b>cover.</b> In 1991, the 1JZ-GTE was slotted into the all-new Soarer GT.|$|E
50|$|The CR-X {{equipped}} with the 1.6 DOHC engine (ZC engine) or the 1.6 DOHC VTEC engine (B16A) came with a different hood since the B16A and ZC engines were taller and required additional hood clearances {{in comparison to the}} 1.6 SOHC engines. The ZC engine was only slightly taller than the 1.6 SOHC engine and required additional hood clearance to clear the cam <b>gear</b> <b>cover.</b> A CR-X {{equipped with}} the ZC engine had a hood with a bump on one side which offered the additional necessary clearance. Cars equipped with a B16A engine came with a hood that was raised across most of the engine bay to offer additional overall clearance for the taller engine.|$|E

50|$|After tests, an {{improved}} variant, the Junak 2 was flown on July 12, 1949. Notable changes from the Junak 1 included the cockpit being moved forward, the fin being increased in area, {{a more powerful}} M-11FR engine (118 kW, 160 hp) was fitted and the massive landing <b>gear</b> <b>covers</b> were deleted. The plane's handling improved. The LWD team disbanded in 1950 and Junak 2 development was continued by the CSS workshops in Warsaw. After further improvements the prototype was designated the Junak-2bis, but finally entered production in 1951 as the Junak-2. Tadeusz Sołtyk was given a State Award in 1952 for the design. From 1951 to 1954, 105 Junak 2s were produced in the WSK-Okęcie in Warsaw (the first 3 in the WSK-Mielec).|$|R

50|$|The PWS-54 was {{evaluated}} by LOT Polish Airlines from 1933 but after few {{years it was}} withdrawn from use {{and returned to the}} factory. The design was not quite successful; the main fault was too small a payload, which limited either its capacity or range. It was intended to carry four passengers but at this weight the range was too small (500 km) to be useful, so it was completed with only three passenger seats. However, because of not too good handling it was not used to carry passengers at all but only for cargo and mail transport. It also had quite long landing run despite air brakes in landing <b>gear</b> <b>covers.</b> A modernized PWS-24bis with a more powerful engine offered the same performance.|$|R
5000|$|The Worlds of Power series omitted violent {{elements}} in the video games. Video game covers were adapted into the book covers after weaponry was omitted. For instance in Ninja Gaiden cover, the dagger that Ryu Hayabusa held {{in front of him}} is no longer visible. In Metal <b>Gear</b> <b>cover,</b> Solid Snake no longer holds his gun; 1up.com Scott Sharkey said that without the gun, Snake was [...] "making a vaguely masturbatory gesture." [...] Within the texts, death and violence were not inflicted on humans and animals. In the Blaster Master book, the bosses appearing like mutated animals are holographic projections placed on formless blobs. In the Metal Gear book, Snake—described as a [...] "walking arsenal"—uses his guns only to pistol whip enemies. In the Ninja Gaiden book, Ryu Hayabusa's father—seemingly killed in the prologue of the game and said to be dead in earlier book chapters—is revealed as alive {{by the end of the}} book. In the Infiltrator book, an agent scheduled to be [...] "voided" [...] either has his memory wiped clean, receives exiling, or receives a demotion. In Bionic Commando, the protagonist's gun shoots [...] "stun bullets" [...] and the protagonist uses karate chops to disable enemies. Towards the end of that book, a clone of Adolf Hitler kills the enemy leader; the protagonist feels no sympathy since the leader was, as stated by 1up.com, [...] "an evil man being eliminated by an even more evil man." [...] In addition, overtly magical and occult references were omitted from the Before Shadowgate book.|$|E

50|$|Yak-9T with Klimov VK-105PF2 {{engine and}} {{numerous}} aerodynamic and structural improvements introduced on Yak-3. Main visual difference from Yak-9T {{was in the}} oil coolers in the wing roots like on Yak-3 and in plywood covering of the fuselage instead of fabric. Visually differed from Yak-3 only by main landing <b>gear</b> <b>covers.</b> Armament increased to 1 × 23 mm VYa with 60 rounds and 2 × 12.7 mm UBSs with 170 rpg. The VYa cannon could {{be replaced by a}} ShVAK, B-20, or NS-37, the latter requiring removal of the starboard UBS machine gun. Did not enter production because the VYa cannon was considered unsatisfactory and because the one cannon, one machine gun armament seen on previous models offered a significant increase in range.|$|R
50|$|The Gamma was {{a further}} {{development}} of the successful Northrop Alpha and shared its predecessor's aerodynamic innovations with wing fillets and multicellular stressed-skin wing construction.

5000|$|The film {{received}} extensive {{cooperation from}} the Department of Defense, especially the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps. One of many problems encountered during production was {{that at the time}} of the filming (late 1963-1964), very few ships in active Navy service resembled their World War II configuration. Only one WW II vintage heavy cruiser; the [...] still retained most of her wartime configuration (and as a result she stood in for a couple of unnamed cruisers during the movie), and an accompanying destroyer, , that took on the role of USS Cassiday were extensively filmed on. Other U.S. Navy ships that participated included the cruiser [...] (though only the forward 2/3's of the ship could be shown as she had missiles aft), destroyers , , , , submarine [...] and the attack transport [...] All of the destroyers had to have their modern (1960s) ASW <b>gear</b> <b>covered</b> over with fake gun-mounts or deck houses. Additional smaller vessels were provided in support, as well as an HU-16 Albatross amphibious aircraft, even though said aircraft did not enter the U.S. inventory until 1949. The HU-16 likely substitutes for a PBY Catalina, of which no flyable examples were likely available for the film schedule.|$|R
