5|$|A Trip to the Moon was {{met with}} {{especially}} large enthusiasm in the United States, where (to Méliès's chagrin) its piracy by Lubin, Selig, Edison and others gave it wide distribution. Exhibitors in New York City, Washington D.C., Cleveland, Detroit, New Orleans, and Kansas City reported on the film's great success in their theaters. The film also <b>did</b> <b>well</b> in other countries, including Germany, Canada, and Italy, where it was featured as a headline attraction through 1904.|$|E

The music has overall been well received and several tracks have received particular praise.

5|$|During the 1780s, Johnson {{achieved}} success: he <b>did</b> <b>well</b> {{financially and}} his firm published more books with other firms. Although Johnson had begun {{his career as}} a relatively cautious publisher of religious and scientific tracts, he was now able to take more risks and he encouraged friends to recommend works to him, creating a network of informal reviewers. Yet Johnson's business was never large; he usually had only one assistant and never took on an apprentice. Only {{in the last years of}} his life did two relatives assist him.|$|E
5|$|East Carolina {{had been}} shaky on defense. ECU ranked 98th in total defense and 115th in passing defense, giving up {{an average of}} 436.42yards per game. Despite that fact, the Pirates <b>did</b> <b>well</b> in the {{turnover}} battle, gaining 27turnovers while losing just 13–a margin of +14–good enough for ninth in the country. In addition, the ECU defense ranked eleventh nationally in tackles for loss. Defensive linemen Zack Slate and C.J. Wilson and defensive back Van Eskridge took C–USA All–Conference second team honors.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{attended}} the common schools in Delaware, Ohio, and enrolled in 1836 at the Methodist Norwalk Seminary in Norwalk, Ohio. He <b>did</b> <b>well</b> at Norwalk, {{and the following}} year transferred to The Webb School, a preparatory school in Middletown, Connecticut, where he studied Latin and Ancient Greek. Returning to Ohio, he attended Kenyon College in Gambier in 1838. He enjoyed his time at Kenyon, and was successful scholastically; while there, he joined several student societies and became interested in Whig politics. He graduated with highest honors in 1842 and addressed the class as its valedictorian.|$|E
5|$|Himmler's first name, Heinrich, {{was that}} of his godfather, Prince Heinrich of Bavaria, {{a member of the}} royal family of Bavaria, who had been tutored by Gebhard Himmler. He {{attended}} a grammar school in Landshut, where his father was deputy principal. While he <b>did</b> <b>well</b> in his schoolwork, he struggled in athletics. He had poor health, suffering from lifelong stomach complaints and other ailments. In his youth he trained daily with weights and exercised to become stronger. Other boys at the school later remembered him as studious and awkward in social situations.|$|E

5|$|In October 1968, Crawford's 29-year-old daughter, Christina (who {{was then}} acting in New York on the CBS soap opera The Secret Storm), needed {{immediate}} medical attention for a ruptured ovarian tumor. Despite {{the fact that}} Christina's character was a 28-year-old and Crawford was in her sixties, Crawford offered to play her role until Christina was well enough to return, to which producer Gloria Monty readily agreed. Although Crawford <b>did</b> <b>well</b> in rehearsal, she lost her composure while taping and the director and producer were left to struggle {{to piece together the}} necessary footage.|$|E
5|$|Industrial metal {{developed}} in the late 1980s, as industrial and metal began to fuse into a common genre. In {{the early years of}} the 21st century, groups from the black metal scene began to incorporate elements of industrial music. Industrial metal <b>did</b> <b>well</b> in the early 1990s, particularly in North America, with the success of groups such as Nine Inch Nails. The industrial metal movement began to fade in the latter half of the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Pacino's career {{slumped in}} the early 1980s; his {{appearances}} in the controversial Cruising, a film that provoked protests from New York's gay community, and the comedy-drama Author! Author!, were critically panned. However, 1983's Scarface, directed by Brian De Palma, {{proved to be a}} career highlight and a defining role. Upon its initial release, the film was critically panned due to violent content, but later received critical acclaim. The film <b>did</b> <b>well</b> at the box office, grossing over US$45 million domestically. Pacino earned a Golden Globe nomination for his role as Cuban drug lord Tony Montana.|$|E
5|$|The Clinton {{campaign}} had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign. There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff {{and she made}} several top-level personnel changes. Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton. On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places, where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped {{in a state where}} the trade agreement was unpopular. Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored preparation. Obama <b>did</b> <b>well</b> in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton <b>did</b> <b>well</b> in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated. Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.|$|E

5|$|A Warrior Who Fought Custer was {{published}} in April 1931 to mostly good reviews. However, W. J. Ghent, writing in the New York Times, criticized the claim made by Wooden Leg that many of Custer's men had committed suicide rather than face death {{at the hands of}} the Indians. Although sales of the Wooden Leg book <b>did</b> <b>well,</b> better than Marquis had expected, this controversy was to prove a hindrance to his chances of future book publications. Marquis believed he had multiple Indian sources verifying this account, and there were no surviving whites to contradict it. He planned to develop the idea more fully in a future book, eventually to become Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, {{the boys}} would play sports, boxing, or other leisure activities, or have hockey or rugby league {{training}} if the weather was suitable. Weekends revolved mainly around sports. Field hockey, rugby league, and other sports were commonly played during the winter time. The boys of the orphanage had a well-known reputation in Goulburn for their sports abilities; boys who participated in tournaments and games usually <b>did</b> <b>well,</b> winning many trophies. The orphanage also had a football team. Sometimes, the boys would hold fetes or participate in annual concerts and operettas, where they would sing and dance.|$|E
5|$|Back in New Zealand, Lynch <b>did</b> <b>well</b> in {{the premier}} women's road stage race in 1991 and 1992, and won bronze in the 1991 New Zealand National Road Race Championships, yet was not picked for the 1992 Olympic road cycling team. Her biographer speculates that the {{selectors}} were possibly influenced in their decision by Lynch's failure to get Harris into a medal {{position at the}} 1990 Commonwealth Games. She competed hard in the 1992 Tour Cycliste Féminin – the Tour de France for women. The ten-stage race was the most challenging event on the women's road racing calendar that year, and many big names entered. New Zealand had six competitors. Lynch {{set the tone for}} the team by coming fourth in the prologue in Paris. Jacqui Nelson and Lynch were the only New Zealanders remaining in the final stage, and Lynch came sixth ascending into Alpe d'Huez. Her biographer suggests that she made her point that her omission from the 1992 Olympic team had been a mistake.|$|E
