40|$|Under {{relatively}} low-head discharges, {{the occurrence}} of nappe oscillation, otherwise known as nappe vibration, may be observed on hydraulic structures with a <b>free</b> <b>overfall,</b> such as <b>weirs,</b> crest gates and fountains. This phenomenon, which has been early identified as undesirable and potentially dangerous on gates, is characterized by oscillations in the thin flow nappe cascading downstream of the crest. In addition, these oscillations produce a significant level of noise and acoustic pressure waves that increase the environmental and societal impacts of the structure. A review of the scientific literature shows a lack of consensus regarding the causes and source of the oscillations development. In this context of relatively poor understanding of the dominant processes, a detailed investigation has been undertaken to identify and quantify the nappe vibration mechanism. The research is being performed with a prototype-scale linear weir located at the Engineering Hydraulics laboratory of the University of Liège. The study employs high-speed cameras and audio equipment to characterize the nappe vibration. This paper presents first characteristics of the nappe vibrations gained from images and sound analysis, {{especially in terms of}} vibration frequency, for a quarter round and a half round weir crest. This study shows that frequencies measured by sound and image analyses are identical and depend on the crest shape, the fall height and the unit discharge. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Gradually {{expanding}} {{channels and}} abrupt enlargement channels are integrated as expanding channels. Aiming at the energy dissipation efficiency {{difference between the}} two channels, this study proceeds <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> through <b>weir</b> channel tests to verify the theoretical formulas of conjugate depth ratio ϕ, relative energy loss ∆E/E_i and energy dissipation efficiency of <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> hydraulic jump η. Forty eight sets of experiments with various weir height(H_d= 14. 2 ~ 52. 5 cm), weir width(b= 5 ~ 18. 2 cm), and unit flow discharge (q= 0. 00632 ~ 0. 0717 cms/m) are conducted to verify the theory. Sensitivity analysis for the effects among various hydraulic parameters are also performed. Finally, three cases are selected to illustrate {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the energy dissipation of expanding channels, which can be used as references for engineering design. In terms of sensitivity analyses, the conjugate depth ratio ϕ and side pressure correction factor C_p of gradually expanding channels are more affected by the channel width ratio μ before and after hydraulic jump, with positive and negative correlations, respectively. The Froude number at the beginning of hydraulic jump F_i appears to have a larger effect on the conjugate depth ratio ϕ of abrupt enlargement channels, showing positive correlation. Relative energy losses ∆E⁄E_i for both channels are highly affected by the Froude number at the beginning of hydraulic jump F_i, presenting positive correlation. The relative water depth at the beginning of jump ψ affects the energy dissipation efficiency of <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> hydraulic jump η the most, revealing positive correlation. Moreover, from the case studies, abrupt enlargement channels present better energy dissipation efficiency than gradually expanding channels do. However, the engineering design of abrupt enlargement channels requires a larger hinterland.

Transfer of gases between the atmosphere and river water can occur in a <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> jet from a <b>weir.</b> A <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> jet from a weir plunging into down-stream water causes entrainment of air bubbles if the <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> jet velocity exceeds the critical value where aeration occurs. This paper investigates the <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> jets from Venturi and rectangular notch weirs and their effect on air entrainment rate. A Venturi weir was placed at the upstream channel end {{in order to increase}} the flow velocity of the <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> jet and, in turn, to increase air entrainment. It was demonstrated that the air entrainment rate of the Venturi weir is significantly better than the rectangular notch weir, and this advantage becomes more pronounced as the throat width of the Venturi weir is decreased. These results demonstrated that Venturi weirs can be used as highly effective aerators in streams, rivers, constructed channels, fish hatcheries, water treatment plants, etc. Moreover, a regression equation was obtained for the Venturi weirs, relating air entrainment rate to unit discharge, weir crest width, drop height and throat width of Venturi weir.

40|$|Flumes and weirs are {{hydraulic}} structures used {{to measure}} soil erosion and runoff at the outlet of agricultural catchments. Long-throated flumes use critical flow theory to determine discharge from a single water depth measurement upstream of the flume structure. In erodible catchments, sediments often deposit {{at the entrance of}} the flume, just where water level is measured, preventing proper discharge determination. This work proposes the combination of critical depth theory with two models of water flow at <b>free</b> <b>overfalls</b> that may be applied when the exit of the flume presents a drop. The method allows the recording of discharge measurements when the upstream water level sensor fails because of the accumulation of sediments. This paper proposes three discharge predictors: (1) one based on critical flow theory, (2) another based on the momentum balance between the critical section and the <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> section, and (3) the third based on energy balance between the upstream water section and the <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> section. Two flume performance indicators and a practical protocol are used to decide, based on the performance indicators, which of the three discharge predictors is most appropriate for every flow situation. The critical flow discharge predictor is recommended when the performance indicators show evidence of no sediment deposition at the upstream section. On the contrary, the momentum balance discharge predictor is recommended if there is evidence of sediments deposition. In case of uncertainty, the recommended discharge predictor is the one based on energy balance between the upstream and the <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> sections. The proposed equations apply to trapezoidal flumes, but they could be adapted for other geometries. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Results pointed that the air entrainment of the weirs changed depending on weir types. At low drop heights, triangular broad-crested weir had the higher values of the air entrainment rate than the other weir types tested and this advantage becomes more pronounced as the angle in triangular broad-crested weir was decreased. However, at high drop heights, the venturi weir was observed to have the greater values of air entrainment rate than the other weir types tested.

40|$|Introduction: A <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> {{offers a}} simple device for flow {{discharge}} measuring {{by a single}} measurement of depth {{at the end of}} the channel yb which is known as the end depth or brink depth. When the bottom of a channel drops suddenly, the flow separates from sharp edge of the brink and the pressure distribution is not hydrostatic because of the curvature of the flow. In channels with subcritical flow regime, control section occurs at the upstream with a critical depth (yc). Although pressure distribution at the critical depth is hydrostatic, the location of the critical depth can vary with respect to the discharge value. So, the end depth at brink is offered to estimate the discharge. A unique relationship between the brink depth (yb) and critical depth (yc), known as end-depth ratio (EDR = yb/yc), exist. Since a relationship between the discharge and critical depth exists, the discharge can ultimately be related to yb. However, when the approaching flow is supercritical, critical section does not exist. Therefore, the discharge will be a function of end depth and channel longitudinal slope. In current study, an analytical model is presented for a circular <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> with different flat base height in subcritical and supercritical flow regimes. The flow over a drop in a <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> is simulated by applying the energy to calculate the EDR and end depth-discharge (EDD) relationship. End-depth-discharge relationship: The flow of a <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> in a channel can be assumed that is similar to the flow over a sharp-crested weir by taking weir height equal to zero. It is assumed that pressure at the end section is atmospheric, and also streamlines at the end section are parallel. To account for the curvature of streamlines, the deflection of jet due to gravity, the coefficient of contraction, Cc, is considered. At a short distance upstream the end section, the pressure is hydrostatic. By applying the energy equation between end section and control section which is at upstream the end section, the flow depth {{at the end of the}} channel yb in terms of depth at the control section can be determined. Subcritical flow regime: In this case, the approach flow to the brink is subcritical for negative, zero and mild bed slopes with critical depth at the control section. Using the definition of the Froude number at critical depth, the discharge can be determined. As the explicit relationship between discharge and depth at the brink don’t exist, a relationship should be presented through regression analysis between discharge and yb using the different values of yc over the practical range of 0. 01 to 0. 84. In this study, below explicit equation is presented for computing Q*(dimensionless discharge) in terms of () : Where d is channel diameter, is the ratio of bottom elevation to the channel diameter and. This equation can be used for different values of over the practical range of 0. 06 – 0. 6. Supercritical flow regime: A critical flow occurs upstream of the <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> under the subcritical approach flow. However, no such critical flow occurs in the vicinity of the overfall under supercritical flow regime. Therefore, the Manning equation for known value of channel bed slope and Manning’s coefficient is exercised to derive the discharge relationship under the supercritical flow regime. Since an explicit equation for discharge in term of yb is impossible, a direct graphical solution for discharge for known end depth, channel bed slope, and ratio of bottom elevation has been provided for supercritical flow regime. Conclusion: The <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> in a circular channel with flat base has been simulated by the flow over a sharp-crested weir to calculate the end-depth ratio. This method also eliminates the need of an empirical pressure coefficient. The method estimates the discharge from the known end-depth. In subcritical flows, the EDR has been related to the critical-depth. On the other hand, in supercritical flows, the end-depth has been expressed as a function of the longitudinal slope of the channel using the Manning equation. The mathematical solutions allow estimation of discharge from the known end-depth in subcritical and supercritical flows. The comparisons of the experimental data with this model have been satisfactory for subcritical flows and acceptable for supercritical flows...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{hydraulic}} structures crossing rivers {{have been}} widely used in both natural and artificial channels to process the water resource management. Although the upstream channel can be stable, gravel deposition on the hydraulic structures can increase the upstream channel bed slope. These structures usually lead to a sudden vertical change of channel slope and induce a <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> flow. In addition, the large impact force of a free-falling nappe due to <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> flow usually damages the hydraulic structures. According to statistics of the 965 check dams in Taiwan, there are 796 check dams (82 percent of the 965 check dams) with average slopes less than 6 percent. It is worth studying the impact characteristics and their relationships to upstream channel bed slope. This study carried out a series of indoor flume experiments of single-stage <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> flows with clear water under steady flow conditions for various upstream bed slopes (S= 0 ~ 6 %) and drop heights (H= 0. 15 ~ 0. 30 m). The longitudinal pressure head distribution along the downstream channel bed was measured by taking readings from a set of pressure transducer system, which does not affect the existing flow field. Besides, the theoretical equations associated with the impact of hydraulic characteristics were validated by the experimental data. The experimental results indicate that the dimensionless flow depth at brink is inversely proportional to the upstream Froude number and the bed slope of the upstream channel S. The nappe trajectory is inversely proportional to the flow depth at brink Froude number and S. The dimensionless impact position appears to be proportional to the drop number and S. The nappe impact angle is inversely proportional to both D and S. The dimensionless depth of tail water and the dimensionless depth of pool are proportional to D but they are inversely proportional to S. Finally, a series of empirical relationships involving the hydraulic impact parameters of <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> flow were suggested for design reference. 由於河川整治或取水等目標，經常設置跌流工於河道中，雖可穩定上游河道，卻因砂石無法向下運送，而淤積於跌流工上游河道渠床，導致跌流工上游渠床坡度增大，當流速呈超臨界流況時，亦加速水流沖擊力，是導致消能工最易受損之原因。有鑑前人研究多著重於上、下游消能關係及對於流場內部變化之探討，鮮少針對上游渠床變化時自由跌流沖擊流場特性進行研究。依據台灣 965 座的防砂壩資料統計，其上游淤砂坡度 小於 6 %，共 796 座占全部 965 座之 82 %，當上游渠床坡度改變後，其沖擊水力特性又為何，實值得進一步加以探討。 本研究運用室內渠槽試驗，採定量清水流及針對不同上游渠床坡度S(= 0 ~ 6 %) 、不同跌流高度H(= 0. 15 ~ 0. 30 m) 進行超臨界自由跌流試驗。藉以跌流工下游設置不干擾流場之壓力量測系統，收集資料擷取器所輸出之訊號、測定下游渠床水力特性相關數據，加以分析探討，並經由試驗結果驗證文中所推導之沖擊水力特性各物理量理論式。 研究結果獲致相對跌流工邊緣水深與上游福祿數及上游渠床坡度呈負相關；水舌軌跡與跌流工邊緣福祿數及上游渠床坡度呈負相關；相對跌流沖擊位置與跌水數及上游渠床坡度呈正相關；跌流沖擊角度與跌水數及上游渠床坡度呈負相關；相對尾水深及相對水墊區水深則與跌水數呈正相關，與上游渠床坡度為負相關。文中並提出一系列迴歸經驗式，以作為有關自由跌流沖擊水力參數設計參考用。目錄 中文摘要	I Abstract	II 目錄	III 圖目錄	V 表目錄	VII 附圖目錄	VII 附表目錄	VII 照片目錄	VII 符號說明	VIII 第一章	前 言	 1 1 - 1 	研究動機	 1 1 - 2 	研究目的	 2 1 - 3 	本文組織	 2 第二章	文獻回顧	 4 2 - 1 	跌緣水深與水舌軌跡	 4 2 - 2 	跌流沖擊位置	 5 2 - 3 	跌流沖擊角度	 7 2 - 4 	尾水深與水墊區水深	 7 第三章	理論分析	 10 3 - 1 	跌緣水深與水舌軌跡	 10 3 - 2 	跌流沖擊位置	 12 3 - 3 	跌流沖擊角度	 13 3 - 4 	尾水深與水墊區水深	 15 第四章	渠槽試驗	 18 4 - 1 	試驗規劃與佈置	 18 4 - 2 	試驗設備與儀器	 21 4 - 3 	試驗步驟與方法	 23 4 - 4 	試驗假設與條件	 32 第五章	試驗結果與分析	 33 5 - 1 	跌緣水深與水舌軌跡	 33 5 - 2 	跌流沖擊位置	 38 5 - 3 	跌流沖擊角度	 43 5 - 4 	尾水深與水墊區水深	 48 5 - 5 	坡度效應	 57 5 - 6 	案例說明	 58 第六章	結論與建議	 62 6 - 1 	結論	 62 6 - 2 	建議	 64 參考文獻	 65 附圖	 67 附表	 69 照片	 72 個人簡歷	 7...|$|R

Near the southern bank, there was a sluice (marked [...] "E" [...] on the sketch), which was 30 ft wide, and was fitted with flood gates and overfall boards, to accommodate a drop of 3 to 4 ft in the river level. The flash lock was in the centre, with a winch on the north bank to haul the barges through against the current. It was 23 ft wide, which was the standard size for all flash locks below Abingdon. Near to the island was a [...] "tumbling bay", an <b>overfall</b> <b>weir</b> with its crest just below normal low water level. It was about 35 ft wide and is marked [...] "H" [...] on the sketch. In common {{with most of the}} weirs on the Thames, the width of the tumbling bay was gradually increased, until it formed most of the weir, apart from the sluice.|$|R
40|$|Linville Land Harbor Dam was {{recently}} rehabilitated and {{provided with a}} labyrinth spillway to increase flood passage capacity. Nappe vibration, a condition that can occur at hydraulic structures with a <b>free</b> <b>overfall,</b> has been observed for low flows. The associated noise affects a private residence {{in close proximity to}} the spillway. As a result, a detailed investigation has been undertaken at the Utah Water Research Laboratory that uses physical modelling (linear weirs) to study mitigation options. Nappe vibration for a fully vented nappe has been observed in the laboratory. Preliminary results indicate that nappe breakers are a less desirable mitigation option due to spacing requirements. Adding roughness to the crest is highly effective as it increases turbulence, perturbs the laminar boundary layer, decreases nappe uniformity, and alters the flow characteristics where the nappe impacts the tailwater...|$|R
40|$|With the {{advances}} in numerical methods, {{three dimensional models}} for free surface turbulent flows have been accepted as a tool in the hydraulic research and applied to studies of flow field, sediment transport and pollutant transport for engineering projects. Because {{of the complexity of}} the flow physics, numerical model simulations are only approximations to the real physical processes. Comparing with the physical model data, Physical Validation, {{is the only way to}} exam weather or not the predictions of a numerical model can reflect the true physics concerned. In this paper, several cases of validating a three-dimensional free-surface turbulence flow model, CCHE 3 D, using physical model data, such as <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> flow, curved channel flows and flow over a submerged weir, are presented. These cases indicate that dynamic pressures, free surface algorithms and sophisticated turbulence closure schemes, etc. are essential to predicting correct physics in turbulent flows...|$|R
40|$|Sideweirs are {{hydraulic}} structures {{commonly used}} in combined sewer systems for separating excess storm water from urban sewage. In the case of low-crested sideweirs, the design is difficult because supercritical flows may establish along the overflow reach. This can lead to transcritical conditions not easily modelled in many cases. The present paper analyses the supercritical outflow process over a low-crested bilateral sideweir in a circular channel, based on both experimental and numerical investigations. Experiments were conducted to define the approach water depth and the free-surface profiles. The measurements were compared with the numerical values resulting from the application of energy and momentum conservation principles. The paper shows that the formulas used for estimating the end depth at <b>free</b> <b>overfalls</b> in circular channels {{can be applied to}} evaluate the approach water. The numerical investigation proves that the energy conservation approach allows for the computation of free-surface profiles with reasonable accuracy...|$|R
40|$|The {{control volume}} {{approach}} in fluid mechanics relies upon {{the conservation of}} energy, momentum and angular momentum. However, open channel flows are typically related to only conservation of energy and momentum. Thus, for flows of non-uniform velocity and non-hydrostatic pressure distributions, the number of unknowns is larger than that of equations for depth-averaged models. This gap resulted in semi-empirical approaches either using momentum or using energy conservation. However, a more fundamental depth-averaged model may be developed by accounting for angular momentum balance. This basic approach was largely overlooked in hydraulic practice. The generalized form of the control volume conservation laws in curvilinear flow are presented herein, including the angular momentum balance. The development is used {{to prove that the}} classical Boussinesq-type solution does not satisfy the angular momentum balance. A more general Boussinesq approach is considered and applied to the 2 D <b>free</b> <b>overfall,</b> indicating its ability to reproduce the salient flow features. © 2010 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.

40|$|Free jets are {{important}} flow phenomena from outflow structures of dams and reservoirs. The basic case of jet flow originates from a <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> with upstream critical flow conditions and a fully ventilated nappe. In this paper, a two-dimensional potential flow {{model has been}} developed. Semiinverse mapping of the Laplace equation has been employed in conjunction with an analytical solution of the Boussinesq equations to initiate iterations for locating the free streamlines under atmospheric pressure. A systematic iteration method is proposed using the squaring technique for solving the Laplacian field, a computation of the free streamlines using the curvilinear formulation of velocity at boundary streamlines in the energy equation, and an iteration {{of the position of}} the terminal jet section versus the brink section conditions. The model permits a convergent numerical solution, which was verified against experimental data, thereby indicating that the proposed ideal fluid flow model can be applied to predict the shape of free jets by simple computations © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the local bed scour {{downstream}} of low-head spillways with stilling basins. Experiments were carried out in a 1 m wide rectangular channel. <b>Free</b> <b>overfall</b> jets from an ogee-crested spillway plunged into a positive-step stilling basin or a plain horizontal apron. Four nearly uniform bed sediments were used. All the experiments were performed under steady approach flow conditions and runs lasted three days on average to achieve a quasi-equilibrium state and well developed scour pits. Tail water depths were set to minimize the combination of local and general scour phenomena. Based on the experimental data, salient features on the spatial and temporal evolution of the local bed morphology are provided highlighting {{the effects of the}} end-sill. It was found that the main parameters governing the scouring process are the tailwater densimetric Froude number, the relative tailwater depth, and a dimensionless time. The temporal variation of the scour hole geometry can be estimated by using simple power-type equations that relate the scour geometry to the controlling scour parameters. Polynomial-type equations are also given for the temporal axial scour profiles...|$|R
40|$|REFINEMENTS are {{constantly}} being introduced in the methods of measuring flowing water. In recent years, many {{attempts have been made}} to avoid the necessity of calibrating each individual measuring device, by utilizing the principle of critical depth for parallel flow. Unfortunately, in the critical-depth meters thus far devised, it has been impossible to prevent the apparent control section from shifting indeterminately upstream or downstream as the discharge varies, and so the need for experimentally determined coefficients has not yet been eliminated. In the present article Dr. Rouse points out the possibility of using the <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> as a flow meter which needs no calibration. Although the flow at the overfall is not parallel, the crest section is that of true minimum energy and hence is the actual control section. Furthermore, the crest depth is a constant percentage of the computed critical depth for parallel flow. Dr. Rouse's analysis has been verified by experiment, and should provide a dependable and simple means of determining discharge at points of overfall...|$|R
40|$|Many {{pressurized}} sewer {{systems do}} not reach their design capacity discharge due to enlarged {{resistance in the}} pipe system. An extensive investigation has brought to light that air pockets in pipe systems are an important cause of high resistance in sewer system pipe lines. Air intake by pumps in sumps {{is one of the}} main reasons of air pocket formation in sewer systems. But there is still little known about air entrainment due to plunging jets from circular open channels, and air intake by submersible pumps near plunging jets, especially at the scale of real sewer sumps. The research objective is to achieve knowledge and insight into air entrainment from <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> water jets from horizontal open channels and air bubble intake with submersible sewer pumps. The main questions are: - How does the air entrain into the reservoir? - Where and how many air bubbles can be expected in a certain configuration without any specific measures? - What is the sphere of influence of the submersible sewer pump? - What is a robust measure to prevent air coming into the sewer pump?Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Free surface flow in {{open channel}} {{transitions}} {{is characterized by}} distributions of velocity and pressure that deviate from uniform and hydrostatic conditions respectively. Under such circumstances the widely used expressions in textbooks [e. g. E=h+U 2 /(2 g) and hc=(q 2 /g) 1 / 3] are not valid to investigate the changes in velocity and depth. A depth-averaged form of the Bernoulli equation for ideal fluid flows introduces correction coefficients {{to account for the}} real velocity and pressure distributions into the specific energy equation. The behavior of these coefficients in curvilinear motion at and in the neighbourhood of control sections was not documented in the literature. Herein detailed two-dimensional ideal fluid flow computations are used to characterize the entire velocity and pressure fields in typical channel controls involving transcritical flow, namely the round-crested weir, the transition from mild to steep slope and the <b>free</b> <b>overfall.</b> The detailed two-dimensional ideal fluid flow solution is used to study the behavior of the depth-averaged coefficients, and a novel generalized specific energy diagram is introduced using universal coordinates. The development is used to pursue a simplified critical flow theory for curved flow...|$|R
40|$|Water flow over short {{hydraulic}} transitions {{is usually}} modelled by the irrotational flow theory, {{for which the}} energy head remains constant over the entire flow domain. Velocity and pressure distributions are then obtained based on the stream and potential functions of the flow net. However, experimental evidence may dictate non-uniform energy profiles resulting either from vorticity, viscous effects, or both. For rapidly-varied flows, Hunter Rouse (1906 - 1996) proposed in the early 1930 s the inviscid Euler flow equations. Most of the current curvilinear flow models, however, resort to irrotational flow. In this work, a generalized curvilinear method for real fluid flow is proposed. Based on the streamline vorticity equation, a practical approach is presented for inviscid, rotational flow. The model is verified by data pertaining to the <b>free</b> <b>overfall</b> and further tested with data on viscous flow in undular jumps, thereby resulting in good agreement.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a laser-sheet imaging technique {{to measure the}} water surface of <b>free</b> <b>overfalls</b> with plunge pool. Varying the plunge pool length of a constant approach discharge created skim-ming, periodic oscillatory, and nappe flows. This study analyzes the resulting oscillating water surfaces and temporal variations of water stages at particular positions in the periodic oscillatory flow condition. The oscillation period and amplitude of temporal water stage variation were de-termined by directly measuring the time interval and water stage differences in water stage varia-tions, respectively. The plunge pool length and air pocket characteristics seriously affected the periodic oscillatory flow. The oscillation period increased as the plunge pool length increased. On the other hand, the water stage amplitude decreased sharply when the plunge pool exceeded a specific length. The absence of an air pocket beneath the falling nappe significantly increased the oscillation period and decreased the water stage amplitude. This study investigates water surface oscillation in the plunge pool and the upstream side of the drop. However, the mean end depth of a periodic oscillatory flow with an air pocket is also applicable to discharge estimation using the end depth method...|$|R
40|$|Rivers are {{frequently}} controlled by weirs and low dams. The flow over these structures {{has a significant}} potential for scour even for comparatively low heads. Hence, stilling basins are commonly built to keep energy flows from scouring the streambed. However, the flow turbulence level within them is generally high and local bed scour can develop. This paper deals with temporal and spatial evolution of local scour downstream of low-head stilling basins. In this aim, experiments were carried out in a 1 m wide rectangular channel. <b>Free</b> <b>overfall</b> jets were caused by an ogee-crested spillway and plunged into a positive-step stilling basin.

Tests were of long durations mainly to get well pronounced scour pits and quasi-equilibrium conditions as well. Based on the experimental data, salient features of the bed morphology evolution are provided. Major effects of the endsill on the scour process are also highlighted...|$|R
