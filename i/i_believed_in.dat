25|$|The rectorate was {{an attempt}} to see {{something}} in the movement that had come to power, beyond all its failings and crudeness, that was much more far-reaching and that could perhaps one day bring a concentration on the Germans' Western historical essence. It will in no way be denied that at the time <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> such possibilities and for that reason renounced the actual vocation of thinking in favor of being effective in an official capacity. In no way will what was caused by my own inadequacy in office be played down. But these points of view do not capture what is essential and what moved me to accept the rectorate.|$|E
500|$|Mikoyan {{received}} his {{education at the}} Nersisian School in Tiflis and the Gevorgian Seminary in Vagharshapat (Echmiadzin), both affiliated with the Armenian Apostolic Church. Religion, however, played an increasingly insignificant role in his life. He would later remark that his continued studies in theology drew him closer to atheism: [...] "I had a very clear feeling that I didn't believe in God and that I had in fact received a certificate in materialist uncertainty; the more I studied religious subjects, the less <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> God." [...] Before becoming active in politics Mikoyan had already dabbled {{in the study of}} liberalism and socialism.|$|E

500|$|McCain was {{mentioned}} as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination beginning in 1997, but he took few steps to pursue it, instead concentrating on his 1998 senate re-election. [...] The decision of General Colin Powell not to run helped persuade McCain {{that there might be}} an opening for him. [...] McCain later wrote that he had a [...] "vague aspiration" [...] of running for president for a long time. [...] He would also be candid about his motivation: [...] "I didn't decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism. In truth, I wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to become president. I was sixty-two years old when I made the decision, and I thought it was my one shot at the prize." ...|$|E
500|$|Collins {{decided to}} record {{it in the}} late 1960s amid an {{atmosphere}} of counterculture introspection; {{she was part of}} an encounter group that ended a contentious meeting by singing [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] as it was the only song to which all the members knew the words. Her producer was present and suggested she include a version of it on her 1970 album Whales & Nightingales. Collins, who had a history of alcohol abuse, claimed that the song was able to [...] "pull her through" [...] to recovery. It was recorded in St. Paul's, the chapel at Columbia University, chosen for the acoustics. She chose an a cappella arrangement that was close to Edwin Othello Excell's, accompanied by a chorus of amateur singers who were friends of hers. Collins connected it to the Vietnam War, to which she objected: [...] "I didn't {{know what else to do}} about the war in Vietnam. I had marched, I had voted, I had gone to jail on political actions and worked for the candidates <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in.</b> The war was still raging. There was nothing left to do, I thought... but sing 'Amazing Grace'." [...] Gradually and unexpectedly, the song began to be played on the radio, and then be requested. It rose to number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining on the charts for 15 weeks, as if, she wrote, her fans had been [...] "waiting to embrace it". In the UK, it charted 8 times between 1970 and 1972, peaking at number 5 and spending a total of 75 weeks on popular music charts. [...] Her rendition also reached number 5 in New Zealand and number 12 in Ireland in 1971.|$|E

2500|$|The date of {{publication}} of these poems is in dispute, but her position on slavery in the poems is clear and {{may have led to}} a rift between Elizabeth and her father.

After the Jamaican slave uprising of 1831–32, her father and uncle continued to treat the slaves humanely.|$|E

Gibson later backed away from such conspiracy theories saying, [...] "It was like: 'Hey, tell us a conspiracy'...so I laid out this thing, and suddenly, it was like I was talking the gospel truth, espousing all this political shit like <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> it."

2500|$|In December 1956, {{two months}} after the Hungarian {{revolution}} was violently suppressed by the Soviet Army, Ligeti fled to Vienna with his ex-wife Vera Spitz (whom he was soon to remarry in 1957 and gave birth to a son). He would not see Hungary again until he was invited to judge a competition in Budapest fourteen years later. On his journey to Vienna, he left most of his Hungarian compositions in Budapest, some of which are now lost; he only took with him what he considered to be his most important pieces. He later explained, [...] "I considered my old music of no interest. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> twelve-tone music!" [...] He eventually took Austrian citizenship in 1968.|$|E

I worked out all the angles I could think of, to keep them guessing and hurrying." [...] In the same interview, Cobb talked about having noticed a throwing tendency of first baseman Hal Chase, but having to wait two full years until the opportunity came to exploit it. By unexpectedly altering his own baserunning tendencies, {{he was able to}} surprise Chase and score the winning run of the game in question.|$|E

And I still would lean toward no government and not so many rules, except for traffic lights and things like this. I really believe in traffic regulations." [...] Lynch continued to state that [...] "I don't know if there even is a Libertarian party. They wouldn't have a prayer of getting anywhere. So I'm a Democrat now. And I've always been a Democrat, really.

[...] While on a visit to Scotland, American engineer and producer Niko Bolas, a long-time Neil Young and Rolling Stones associate, tuned into a Travis session on Radio Scotland, and heard something in the band's music which instantly made him travel to Perth to see them. Healy: [...] "He told us we were shit, took us in the studio for four days, and taught us how to play properly, like a band. He was ballsy, rude, and New York pushy.

2500|$|Despite {{his history}} of {{drinking}} and fighting, York attended church regularly and often led the hymn singing. A revival meeting {{at the end of}} 1914 led him to a conversion experience on January 1, 1915. His congregation was the Church of Christ in Christian Union, a Protestant denomination that shunned secular politics and disputes between Christian denominations. This church had no specific doctrine of pacifism but it had been formed in reaction to the Methodist Episcopal Church, South's support of slavery, including armed conflict during the American Civil War, and it opposed all forms of violence. In a lecture later in life, he reported his reaction to the outbreak of World War I: [...] "I was worried clean through. I didn't want to go and kill. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>in</b> my Bible." [...] On June 5, 1917, at the age of 29, Alvin York registered for the draft as all men between 21 and 31 years of age were required to do on that day.
