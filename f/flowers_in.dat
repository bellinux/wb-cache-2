5|$|All of Van Dormael's films contain surreal elements.

5|$|Even in {{his early}} years, Linnæus {{seemed to have a}} liking for plants, <b>flowers</b> <b>in</b> particular. Whenever he was upset, he was given a flower, which {{immediately}} calmed him. Nils spent much time in his garden and often showed flowers to Linnaeus and told him their names. Soon Linnæus was given his own patch of earth where he could grow plants.|$|E
5|$|Farmers and growers often sell {{surplus food}} and <b>flowers</b> <b>in</b> boxes on the roadside, {{relying on the}} honesty of {{customers}} to drop the correct change into the money box and take what they want. In the 21st century, diversification of agriculture and amendments in planning strategy have led to farm shops replacing many of the roadside stalls.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers are {{occasionally}} {{depicted in}} artworks, {{such as the}} Dutch Golden Age painter Balthasar van der Ast's still life oil painting, <b>Flowers</b> <b>in</b> a Vase with Shells and Insects, c. 1630, now in the National Gallery, London, though the insect may be a bush-cricket.|$|E
50|$|In ancient times, {{the town}} was called Pushpawati. This name {{was derived from the}} {{abundance}} of <b>flowering</b> plants <b>in</b> the region (Pushp means <b>flower</b> <b>in</b> Hindi, Pushp + wati means a place where <b>flowers</b> are <b>in</b> abundance).|$|R
5000|$|The first {{introduction}} to Europe was 1907 to England by Ernest Wilson. They are noted for their rare flowering. The {{first time that}} Emmenopterys henryi <b>flowered</b> <b>in</b> mainland Europe was 1971 in the arboretum of Villa Taranto on Lago Maggiore. A specimen <b>in</b> Cambridge <b>flowered</b> <b>in</b> 2012, after 30 years, only the fifth <b>flowering</b> <b>in</b> the UK. In 2013, a tree flowered {{for the fourth time}} in the Arboretum Kalmthout in Belgium. This was unexpected, since the <b>flowers</b> only appeared <b>in</b> September, which is quite late.|$|R

5|$|In view of {{the healthy}} climate in the region, Punakha is the winter capital of Bhutan. The head of the clergy of Bhutan with his entourage of monks spend the winter in this dzong. Jacaranda trees grow around the dzong, {{blooming}} with mauve <b>flowers</b> <b>in</b> the spring.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{was also}} {{commissioned}} {{to write an}} official opening theme for BBC Radio 1's launch in September 1967.

50|$|The {{plant was}} first {{described}} scientifically in 1824 by Nathaniel Wallich. The species was introduced into commercial production (as Lilium giganteum) in Britain in the 1850s. A bulb grown from seed collected by Major Madden <b>flowered</b> <b>in</b> Edinburgh in July 1852, while those collected by Thomas Lobb were first exhibited <b>in</b> <b>flower</b> <b>in</b> May 1853.|$|R
25|$|Most species <b>flower</b> <b>in</b> winter, {{before the}} vernal equinox (20 or 21 March in the Northern Hemisphere), but some <b>flower</b> <b>in</b> early spring and late autumn.

5|$|Rodman's {{first wife}} was Annie Bakes, {{with whom he}} had a {{daughter}} named Alexis (born 1988). They divorced in the early 1990s. Rodman married model Carmen Electra in November 1998 at the Little Chapel of the <b>Flowers</b> <b>in</b> Las Vegas, Nevada. Electra filed for divorce in April 1999.|$|E
5|$|Species {{similar in}} {{appearance}} include mountain hickory wattle (A. obliquinervia), coast golden wattle (A. leiophylla) and golden wreath wattle (A. saligna). Acacia obliquinervia has grey-green phyllodes, fewer <b>flowers</b> <b>in</b> its flower heads, and broader (-wide) seed pods. A. leiophylla has paler phyllodes. A. saligna has longer, narrower phyllodes.|$|E
5|$|Telopea 'Olympic Flame' is a {{form with}} {{prominent}} bracts around the flowerheads. It has large leaves with toothed margins and <b>flowers</b> <b>in</b> early spring. Also known as 'Sunburst', it arose as a seedling in a breeding program conducted by Cathy Offord, Peter Goodwin and Paul Nixon {{under the auspices of}} the University of Sydney.|$|E
50|$|He {{joined the}} firm of Tenney & <b>Flower</b> <b>in</b> 1879, with the firm shortly {{thereafter}} becoming Flower, Tenney & Gregory. He formed a new firm, Gregory, Booth & <b>Flower</b> <b>in</b> 1888. He founded a new firm in 1900, with his son Tappan becoming a partner.|$|R
50|$|This iris {{is one of}} {{the first}} Juno irises to appear in mild winters of Washington, D.C. <b>in</b> the USA, <b>flowering</b> <b>in</b> late February. But it can also <b>flower</b> <b>in</b> March in USDA Zone 7 gardens. In the UK, it blooms between March and April.|$|R

5|$|The Davidson Wildcats, which {{scored the}} most points against Tech (10), {{included}} future Tech running back Buck <b>Flowers</b> <b>in</b> his freshman year.

5|$|The {{most common}} cultivar, 'Blue Spire', {{is among those}} {{suspected}} of being a hybrid. It was selected from German plantings by the British Notcutts Nurseries, and first exhibited in 1961. 'Blue Spire' grows to approximately , and has large, darker blue <b>flowers.</b> <b>In</b> 1993, it received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
5|$|Another parodied film is the 1964 thriller Fail-Safe by Sidney Lumet: at the {{beginning}} of the third act of the episode, scenes of everyday life across Springfield are shown, and one by one, with a 'zooming' sound effect, they all freeze-frame in anticipation of the (supposedly) imminent nuclear blast; such was the ending of Fail-Safe. One of the scenes before the supposed nuclear blast shows Maggie picking <b>flowers</b> <b>in</b> a field, with the camera zooming into her eye, and then the minuscule blast occurs. This is a parody of the infamous and controversial Daisy ad used by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.|$|E
40|$|Mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana {{deficient}} in gibberellin synthesis (ga 1 - 3 and ga 1 - 6), and a gibberellin-insensitive mutant (gai) {{were compared to}} the wild-type (WT) Landsberg erecta line for flowering time and leaf number when grown in either short days (SD) or continuous light (CL). The ga 1 - 3 mutant, which is severely defective in ent-kaurene synthesis because it lacks most of the GA 1 gene, never <b>flowered</b> <b>in</b> SD unless treated with exogenous gibberellin. After a prolonged period of vegetative growth, this mutant eventually underwent senescence without having produced flower buds. The gai mutant and the “leaky” ga 1 - 6 mutant did <b>flower</b> <b>in</b> SD, but took somewhat longer than WT. All the mutants <b>flowered</b> readily <b>in</b> CL, although the ga 1 - 3 mutant showed some delay. Unlike WT and ga 1 - 3, the gai mutant {{failed to respond to}} gibberellin treatment by accelerating <b>flowering</b> <b>in</b> SD. A cold treatment promoted <b>flowering</b> <b>in</b> the WT and gai, but failed to induce <b>flowering</b> <b>in</b> ga 1 - 3. From these results, it appears that gibberellin normally plays a role <b>in</b> initiating <b>flowering</b> of Arabidopsis...|$|R

5|$|At higher altitudes {{the trees}} {{gradually}} thin out {{and there are}} alpine pastures. These pastures are rich in <b>flowers</b> <b>in</b> the late spring. The wildflowers in the park's high meadows include wild pansies, gentians, martagon lilies, and alpenroses. The park has many rocky habitats. They are mostly located above the timberline and alpine pastures. These areas have rock and detritus on their surface. Alpine plants have adapted to these habitats by assuming characteristics like dwarfism, hairiness, bright coloured flowers, and highly developed roots. About 1,500 plant species {{can be seen at}} Paradisia Pyromaniacle Garden near Cogne inside the park.|$|E
5|$|Gaylussacia brachycera {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from {{other members of}} its genus by its leaves: they resemble those of boxwood (hence its name) and lack the resin glands typical of huckleberries. Like its relatives, it bears white urn-shaped <b>flowers</b> <b>in</b> the early summer, which develop to blue, edible berries in late summer. It is mostly found in Appalachia; many of its stations there were known to natives, who picked and ate the berries, before botanists became aware {{of them in the}} 1920s.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Frederick Warne & Co. gave Beswick Pottery of Longton, Staffordshire {{rights and}} {{licences}} {{to produce the}} Potter characters in porcelain. Ribby coming from the farm with butter and milk was released as a figurine in 1951; Duchess with a bouquet of <b>flowers</b> <b>in</b> 1955; Duchess holding the ham and veal pie in 1979; and Ribby and the broken pie dish in 1992. A limited edition tableau depicting Duchess and Ribby was produced only in 2000.|$|E
