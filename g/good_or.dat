5|$|In {{the early}} history of the breed, certain white {{markings}} and whorls were considered to be indicators of character and <b>good</b> <b>or</b> bad luck. Horses with white socks on their feet were considered to have <b>good</b> <b>or</b> bad luck, depending on the leg or legs marked. A horse with no white markings at all was considered to be ill-tempered and vice-ridden, while certain facial markings were considered representative of honesty, loyalty and endurance. Similarly, hair whorls in various places were considered to show <b>good</b> <b>or</b> bad luck, with the most unlucky being in places where the horse could not see them – for example the temples, cheek, shoulder or heart. Two whorls near the root of the tail were considered a sign of courage and good luck.|$|E

5|$|Breadth of {{definition}} of a good: The broader the {{definition of a}} <b>good</b> (<b>or</b> service), the lower the elasticity. For example, Company X's fish and chips would tend to have a relatively high elasticity of demand if a significant number of substitutes are available, whereas food in general would have an extremely low elasticity of demand because no substitutes exist.|$|E

5|$|Private {{entrepreneurs}} sometimes {{resort to}} heavy advertising {{as a means}} of attracting buyers for their products. Although this may lead to a rise in demand for that entrepreneur's <b>good</b> <b>or</b> service, it does not actually raise the aggregate demand in the economy.

5|$|Advances {{of funds}} – Advances are federal funds {{provided}} to a recipient {{before the program}} activity is performed. Recipients determine the amount needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase <b>good</b> <b>or</b> service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize the amount of time between the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program.|$|E

5|$|In Malagasy culture lemurs, {{and animals}} in general, have souls (ambiroa) which can get revenge if mocked while alive or if {{killed in a}} cruel fashion. Because of this, lemurs, like many other {{elements}} of daily life, have {{been a source of}} taboos, known locally as fady, which can be based around stories with four basic principles. A village or region may believe that a certain type of lemur may be the ancestor of the clan. They may also believe that a lemur's spirit may get revenge. Alternatively, the animal may appear as a benefactor. Lemurs are also thought to impart their qualities, <b>good</b> <b>or</b> bad, onto human babies. In general, fady extend beyond a sense of the forbidden, but can include events that bring bad luck.|$|E

Montalbán further stated he always {{tried to find a}} flaw in the character, as no one is completely <b>good</b> <b>or</b> completely evil; while Khan had a rather distorted view of reality and therefore performed acts of evil, he still felt that his vengeance was a noble cause because of the death of his wife. Khan quotes the character of Ahab from Moby-Dick throughout the film, driving home his lust to make Kirk pay for the wrongs he has inflicted upon him.|$|E
