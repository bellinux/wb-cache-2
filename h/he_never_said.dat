5|$|Twilight confronts Discord, {{accusing him}} of {{cheating}} since he destroyed the labyrinth before they {{could get to the}} end of the game. However, Discord counters this by reminding her that, while he had hinted at where the Elements were, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> anything about them being in the labyrinth. As he disappears and teases the ponies with another storm of chocolate rain, Twilight realizes that a line from Discord's riddle actually refers to Ponyville itself.|$|E
5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E
25|$|Many Chassidim of {{the seventh}} Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson felt {{that he is the}} Mashiach of the generation, even though <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> so himself.|$|E

25|$|His {{far more}} ample prose writings, {{peppered}} with many aphorisms and bons mots, reveal a conservative and skeptical outlook on human nature, verging on the cynical. However, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> or wrote anything giving aid or comfort to {{any form of}} totalitarianism popular during his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|On June 7, 1978, Gaggi {{and nine}} other mobsters {{were charged with}} racketeering, conspiracy, and fraud charges {{as a result of}} a year-long federal {{investigation}} into the bankruptcy of a theatre in New York. The majority of the evidence in this case came from wiretapped conversations; fortunately for Gaggi, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> anything incriminating. In December 1978, Gaggi was cleared of all charges.|$|E
500|$|Oppenheimer raised no {{objection}} to the sequence in the film in which he informed Brigadier General Thomas Farrell that {{the odds of a}} runaway explosion destroying the planet were less than one in a million, although he told MGM that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> this. The cultured Oppenheimer's main concern was that the script was poor, with characters that were [...] "stilted, lifeless, and without purpose or insight." ...|$|E

5000|$|Tom Mankiewicz once admitted, [...] "I think Dad is {{probably}} disappointed that I have not worked {{up to what}} he considers to be, and I must say I consider to be, my creative potential. <b>He's</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> <b>he's</b> disappointed, but I know he is, and I know that come Oscar night some year, he {{would love to see}} some wonderful film that I wrote and directed being honored." ...|$|R

2500|$|Contrary to Gold argument, Amichi wrote [...] many [...] {{plays and}} radio plays. {{a book of}} [...] short stories, a [...] second [...] novel and <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> [...] or wrote in any {{interview}} [...] that he hoped that [...] fewer people would read his prose.|$|E
2500|$|The {{story is}} an {{appealing}} one, {{but it is}} largely fictional. Gilbert was interviewed twice about his inspiration for The Mikado. [...] In both interviews the sword was mentioned, {{and in one of}} them he said it was the inspiration for the opera, although <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> that the sword had fallen. What puts the entire story in doubt, moreover, is Cellier and Bridgeman's error concerning the Japanese exhibition in Knightsbridge: It did not open until 10 January 1885, almost two months after Gilbert had already completed Act I. Gilbert scholar Brian Jones, in his article [...] "The Sword that Never Fell", notes that [...] "the further removed in time the writer is from the incident, the more graphically it is recalled." [...] Leslie Baily, for instance, told it this way in 1952: ...|$|E

2500|$|Contrary to George Will's [...] "Al Gore's Green Guilt" [...] Roger Revelle—our {{father and}} the [...] "father" [...] of the {{greenhouse}} effect—remained deeply concerned about global warming {{until his death in}} July 1991. That same year he wrote: [...] "The scientific base for a greenhouse warming is too uncertain to justify drastic action at this time." [...] Will and other critics of Sen. Al Gore have seized these words to suggest that Revelle, who was also Gore's professor and mentor, renounced his belief in global warming. Nothing {{could be further from the}} truth. When Revelle inveighed against [...] "drastic" [...] action, he was using that adjective in its literal sense—measures that would cost trillions of dollars. Up until his death, he thought that extreme measures were premature. But he continued to recommend immediate prudent steps to mitigate and delay climatic warming. Some of those steps go well beyond anything Gore or other national politicians have yet to advocate. [...] Revelle proposed a range of approaches to address global warming. Inaction was not one of them. He agreed with the adage [...] "look before you leap," [...] but <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> [...] "sit on your hands." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 19, 2015, David Corn from Mother Jones broke a story {{reporting}} {{a collection of}} inconsistencies of O'Reilly when recalling his experience covering the 1982 Falklands War. On April 17, 2013, O'Reilly said on his show: [...] "I was in a situation one time, {{in a war zone}} in Argentina, in the Falklands, (...)". In his book, The No Spin Zone, he wrote: [...] "You know that I am not easily shocked. I've reported on the ground in active war zones from El Salvador to the Falklands." [...] On a 2004 column on his website he wrote: [...] "Having survived a combat situation in Argentina during the Falklands war, I know that life-and-death decisions are made in a flash." [...] Corn claimed O'Reilly was not in the Falklands, but in Buenos Aires, and that no American journalist was in the Islands during the conflict. He also pointed out that according to O'Reilly's own book, The No Spin Zone, he arrived in Buenos Aires soon before the war ended. On February 20, 2015, O'Reilly said on his show, [...] "David Corn, a liar, says that I exaggerated situations in the Falklands War" [...] and that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>said</b> he was on the Falkland Islands. O'Reilly went on to describe his experience in a riot in Buenos Aires the day Argentina surrendered. David Corn replied that they didn't claim O'Reilly [...] "exaggerated" [...] but rather that there were contradictions between his accounts and the factual record, and that the 2013 clip from his show proves O'Reilly did in fact say he was on the Falklands. David Corn told The New York Times: [...] "The question is whether Bill O'Reilly was stating the truth when he repeatedly said that Argentine soldiers used real bullets and fired into the crowd of civilians and many were killed." ...|$|E

60|$|Albinia began a vehement vindication {{for their}} having tolerated the engagement, {{in the midst}} of which her brother was obliged to depart, amused at her {{betrayal}} of her own sentiments by warfare against what <b>he</b> had <b>never</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Former Premier Mike Harris {{appeared}} before the inquiry on February 14, 2006. He testified that <b>he</b> had <b>never</b> <b>said</b> the statement attributed to him by Harnick.
