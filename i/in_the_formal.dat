5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate primarily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formal</b> work sector and {{are responsible for}} supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining power because they have limited access to education, formal employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women who are able to work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formal</b> sector typically earn significantly less money than men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E

5|$|Bedford Castle was {{probably}} built after 1100 by Henry I {{in the town}} of Bedford, overlooking the River Great Ouse. The castle was constructed inside the town itself, and many of the older Anglo-Saxon streets had to be destroyed and diverted to make room for it, leaving a permanent mark <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formal</b> grid system. The castle was built in a motte and bailey design and {{was probably}} much smaller than the later castle, just consisting of the motte and the inner bailey.|$|E
5|$|Clifford's Tower {{played no}} part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formal</b> {{design of the}} prison, {{although}} the talus, or sloping edge of the motte, was cut away and replaced by a retaining wall to allow more space for the new prison building. The backyard of the Female Prison, concealed from public view by the new wall, was used for hangings from 1868 onwards. The Prison Act, 1877, reformed the English prison system, and York Castle gaol was passed into the control of central government the following year. It {{was used as the}} county prison until 1900, when the remaining prisoners were transferred to Wakefield Prison, and from then onwards the facility was used as a military prison instead.|$|E

These women were Patricia A. Childress, Lydia L. Lennon, Leslie A. Anderson, Mary L. Duffala, Mary M. Ketterer, Kristina M. Zipsnis, Clara M. Bertilson, and Toni Ryon, who were initiated into Beta Omicron on August 26, 1977. On August 27, Lea F. Fuller was initiated.

5|$|Having {{worked with}} Cary Guffey on Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Spielberg felt {{confident}} {{in working with}} a cast composed mostly of child actors. For the role of Elliott, he auditioned hundreds of boys before Jack Fisk suggested Henry Thomas for the role because Henry had played the part of Harry in the movie Raggedy Man which Jack Fisk had directed. Thomas, who auditioned in an Indiana Jones costume, did not perform well <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formal</b> testing, but got the filmmakers' attention in an improvised scene. Thoughts of his dead dog inspired his convincing tears. Robert MacNaughton auditioned eight times to play Michael, sometimes with boys auditioning for Elliott. Spielberg felt Drew Barrymore had the right imagination for mischievous Gertie after she impressed him with a story that she led a punk rock band. He enjoyed working with the children, and he later said that the experience made him feel ready to be a father.|$|E
5|$|Krüger visited {{several other}} {{concentration}} camps {{to assemble the}} people he needed, primarily selecting those with skills in draftsmanship, engraving, printing and banking. In September 1942 the first 26 prisoners for Operation Bernhard arrived at Sachsenhausen; 80 more arrived in December. When met by Krüger, he called them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formal</b> and polite form , rather than the more demeaning , which was normally used when the Nazis spoke to a Jew. Several of the prisoners selected later reported that Krüger had interviewed them for the role, and treated them with politeness and good manners. He also provided the prisoners with cigarettes, newspapers, extra rations and a radio. Prisoners had a ping pong table, and they would play with the guards and among themselves; evenings of amateur theatricals also took place, staged by the prisoners, with a mixed audience of guards and counterfeiters; Krüger provided musicians for musical numbers.|$|E
