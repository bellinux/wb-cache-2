5|$|During Taraki's foreign {{visit to}} the non-aligned conference in Cuba, his Gang of Four had {{received}} an intelligence report that Amin was planning to arrest or kill them. This report, it turned out, was incorrect. Nonetheless, the Gang of Four were ordered to assassinate Amin, its leader Sarwari selecting his nephew Aziz Akbari to conduct the assassination. However, Akbari was not informed {{that he was the}} chosen assassin or that it was a secret mission, and <b>he</b> <b>confided</b> the information to contacts in the Soviet embassy. The embassy responded by warning Amin of the assassination attempt, thereby saving him from certain death.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Humphrey's run, President Lyndon Johnson began a {{campaign}} for re-election, entering {{his name in the}} first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary for March 1968. Late in 1967, building upon anti-war sentiment, Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota entered the race with heavy criticism of the President's Vietnam War policies. Even before McCarthy's entrance, Johnson grew concerned about a challenge. <b>He</b> <b>confided</b> to Democratic Congressional leaders that an opponent could pull the support of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Dr. Benjamin Spock, defeating him in New Hampshire, and forcing his withdrawal from the race; similar to Senator Estes Kefauver's 1952 challenge to President Harry Truman, which likely caused Truman not to seek re-election.|$|E
5|$|In November 1793, Shelby {{received}} a letter from another of Genêt's agents, Charles Delpeau. <b>He</b> <b>confided</b> to Shelby that he had been sent to secure supplies for an expedition against Spanish holdings, and inquired whether Shelby had been instructed to arrest individuals associated with such a scheme. Three days later Shelby responded by letter, relating Jefferson's warning against aiding the French. Despite having no evidence that Shelby was party to Genêt's scheme, both Jefferson and Knox felt compelled to warn him a second time. Jefferson provided names and descriptions of the French agents believed to be in Kentucky and encouraged their arrest. Knox went a step further by suggesting Kentucky would be reimbursed for any costs incurred resisting the French by force, should such action become necessary. General Anthony Wayne informed him that his cavalry was at the state's disposal. Arthur St. Clair, governor of the American Northwest Territory, also admonished Shelby against cooperation with Genêt.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from service, Al reunited with Lucille, but {{his inability to}} find steady work left the family impoverished. They both struggled with alcohol, and often fought when intoxicated. The violence sometimes drove Hendrix to withdraw and hide in a closet in their home. His relationship with his brother Leon (born 1948) was close but precarious; with Leon {{in and out of}} foster care, they lived with an almost constant threat of fraternal separation. In addition to Leon, Hendrix had three younger siblings: Joseph, born in 1949, Kathy in 1950, and Pamela, 1951, all of whom Al and Lucille gave up to foster care and adoption. The family frequently moved, staying in cheap hotels and apartments around Seattle. On occasion, family members would take Hendrix to Vancouver to stay at his grandmother's. A shy and sensitive boy, he was deeply affected by his life experiences. In later years, <b>he</b> <b>confided</b> to a girlfriend that he had been the victim of sexual abuse by a man in uniform. On December 17, 1951, when Hendrix was nine years old, his parents divorced; the court granted Al custody of him and Leon.|$|E
5|$|Banza soon {{decided to}} stage a coup d'état. <b>He</b> <b>confided</b> in a few {{military}} officers, who he hoped would support his attempt to gain power. One of his confidants, Jean-Claude Mandaba, contacted the president and informed him of {{the date of the}} coup, 9 April 1969. Hours before he was going to execute his bid for power, Banza was ambushed by Mandaba and taken directly to Bokassa. Bokassa nearly beat Banza to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance's sake. On 12 April, Banza presented his case to a military tribunal, which quickly sentenced him to death by firing squad. He was reportedly taken to an open field, where he was executed and buried in an unmarked grave. Alternate circumstances of Banza's death have been reported in Time and Le Monde. In the aftermath of the failed coup, Banza's family, mistress and close associates were all arrested and either sent to jail or deported. With Banza eliminated, Bokassa spent extravagantly and surrounded himself with adulators.|$|E
5|$|In March 1936, for {{his second}} voyage in Gipsy Love, Orsborne {{attempted}} to engage the services of an experienced seaman, Alexander MacLean, to whom <b>he</b> <b>confided</b> that the trip might go further afield—perhaps to Bermuda or South America—but MacLean declined the opportunity. Orsborne offered the mate's berth to Harry Stone, a local seaman who did not possess a mate's ticket but was told by Orsborne that he could use MacLean's number. The other crew members were a Yorkshireman, Hector Harris, and a 17-year-old Scottish cook, Howard Stephens. The formal crew was joined by Orsborne's younger brother James, a grocer, who had no formal status on board and was later classified as a stowaway. Gipsy Love left Grimsby late in March 1936, supposedly to fish in the Dogger Bank area of the North Sea, but within hours had returned to port with engine trouble. With {{the consent of the}} owners, Orsborne transferred stores and crew to another Marstrand vessel, the small trawler Girl Pat; James Orsborne again joined them.|$|E

5|$|The two {{discussed}} {{the matter at}} a meeting in early 1952 in Palm Beach, Florida, where Rodgers was vacationing as he worked on melodic sketches for the television documentary Victory at Sea. Rodgers suggested dispensing with the overture, reserving that for the overture of the show-within-the-show. Following another meeting in mid-1952, they called in long-time Rodgers and Hammerstein stage designer Jo Mielziner and hired him to design the sets. Mielziner confirmed that a scene could be played part onstage and part in the backstage world, but that this would be expensive. In August 1952, Hammerstein began a sketch of the plot; by early October he had a near-complete first draft. As the show was to be musical comedy, the pair hired one of the top musical comedy directors, George Abbott, who accepted the position without reading the script. He regretted the haste of this decision as soon as he read the script, finding it sentimental and melodramatic. <b>He</b> <b>confided</b> his concerns to the pair; in response, Hammerstein told him to make whatever changes in the script he thought best. With Hammerstein's permission, Abbott made major changes to the plot.|$|E
25|$|Gropius's {{career was}} {{interrupted}} by the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Called up immediately as a reservist, Gropius served as a sergeant major at the Western front {{during the war years}} and was wounded and almost killed. Gropius was awarded an Iron Cross (“when it still meant something,” <b>he</b> <b>confided</b> to his friend Chester Nagel) while fighting for four years for Germany on the Western Front.|$|E
25|$|Crittenton {{had been}} {{establishing}} rescue homes, primarily oriented toward providing women {{an alternative to}} prostitution. He founded {{the first one in}} New York City in 1883 following the death of his beloved four-year-old daughter, Florence, after whom he named them. He established others in California and then, in conjunction with the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, {{in various parts of the}} U.S. However, <b>he</b> <b>confided</b> to Barrett that he feared that isolated homes would collapse after a period of initial enthusiasm.|$|E

25|$|Fisher {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York in 1961 to William Fisher, a banker, and Jan Howell. He has two sisters and {{attended}} Sahuaro High School in Tucson, Arizona. His parents divorced in 1976, when he was 15. According to friends and relatives the divorce was extremely difficult, leaving long-lasting effects on him. He spoke of it with coworkers at Mayo Clinic Hospital. <b>He</b> <b>confided</b> to one associate that his life could {{have been different if}} his mother had not left the family.|$|E
25|$|The latter {{were still}} infants {{at the time}} of his death, on which account <b>he</b> <b>confided</b> their guardianship, by his will, to the two kings, Antigonus II Gonatas and Ptolemy II Philadelphus, {{together}} with the free cities of Heraclea Pontica, Byzantium and Cius. But, notwithstanding this precaution, his son Ziaelas quickly established himself on the throne. It is probably this Nicomedes who sought to purchase from the city of Knidos the celebrated statue of Venus, by Praxiteles, by offering to remit the whole public debt of the city.|$|E
25|$|HIlborn began {{advanced}} training in England at the Central Flying School on 15 August 1917.

He actually graduated from the Central Flying School on 14 October 1917. He was then {{supposed to have a}} nasal operation and spend two weeks recovering. <b>He</b> <b>confided</b> to his brother Clarence that he got airsick in anything but straight level flight, and that he expected to become an instructor at Upavon.|$|E

25|$|By {{this time}} Danzig was growing {{increasingly}} {{dissatisfied with the}} Misfits and had begun writings songs for a new band project. In June 1983 <b>he</b> <b>confided</b> to Henry Rollins {{that he planned to}} quit the group. In July 1983 the Misfits finished recording their EP, and Danzig decided to record two more songs that he had intended for his new project, turning it into a full album. Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood demonstrated the increased influence of hardcore punk and heavy metal on the band, though they would break up just two months before it was released. After a series of arguments with Danzig, Robo left the band in August and Danzig became further disenchanted, beginning to audition musicians for his next project.|$|E
25|$|On May 9, 1952, Garfield {{moved out}} of his New York {{apartment}} for the last time, indicating to friends {{it was not a}} temporary separation from his wife Roberta. <b>He</b> <b>confided</b> to columnist Earl Wilson that he would soon be divorced. Close friends speculated that it was his wife's opposition to his planned confession in Look magazine that triggered the separation. He heard that a HUAC investigator was reviewing his testimony for possible perjury charges. His agent reported that 20th Century-Fox wanted him for a film called Taxi, but would not even begin talks unless the investigation concluded in his favor. Three actor friends, Canada Lee, Mady Christians and J. Edward Bromberg, had all recently died after being listed by the committee.|$|E
25|$|It {{was widely}} {{reported}} that since his December 1862 marriage, Morgan had {{lost some of}} his bravado. Morgan, eager to dispel such rumors and weary of guarding Bragg's left flank, proposed a raid through Kentucky and across the Ohio River. Bragg, fearing an attack from Rosecrans, welcomed {{the idea of a}} distraction that would take the pressure off his Army of Tennessee. Morgan gathered his men to an area between Liberty and Alexandria, Tennessee. On June 10, he addressed his unit, telling them that Bragg had sanctioned a raid to Louisville, and if conditions permitted, across the Ohio River into Indiana and possibly Ohio. <b>He</b> <b>confided</b> Bragg's true orders– to halt at the Ohio River– only to trusted confidant Basil Duke.|$|E

25|$|In July 1967, McFall, aged 18 {{and eight}} months {{pregnant}} with Fred's child, vanished. She was never reported missing, but her dismembered remains were found buried {{at the edge of}} a cornfield between Much Marcle and Kempley in June 1994. Her limbs had been carefully disarticulated, and many phalange bones were missing from her body—likely to have been retained as keepsakes; her unborn child may also have been cut from her womb. Although Fred initially denied he had killed McFall, <b>he</b> <b>confided</b> to one visitor following his arrest that he had stabbed her to death following an argument. Nonetheless, this explanation is inconsistent with the fact that her wrists were found with sections of dressing gown cord wrapped around them, suggesting she had been restrained prior to her murder.|$|E
25|$|News {{spread quickly}} among the Italian courts, and Guy de Brimeu, {{counselor}} of the Duke of Burgundy, was particularly surprised about the developing {{news of the}} marriage. Ferdinand knew that the wedding plans were fluctuating and subject to political uncertainties and questions, and this was even more true elsewhere like in the Court of Burgundy. <b>He</b> <b>confided</b> in his son with two major tasks: the first was to give to Charles the Bold the collar of the Order of the Ermine he had created, and welcome him to the Order of the Knights of the Fleece or, the second was to replace, in the entourage of Charles, Nicola di Monforte Pietravalle, Count of Campobasso, a former vassal of Ferdinand who served René of Anjou and had ties to John of Calabria, who recruited mercenaries in Piedmont, Lombardy and Emilia {{to serve in the}} army of Burgundy.|$|E
25|$|Iron Workers {{president}} Frank Ryan asked Clarence Darrow {{to defend}} the McNamaras. Darrow had become a hero in labor circles for his successful defense of labor leader Bill Haywood in 1906. However, Darrow was in ill health, and although organized labor was convinced of the McNamaras’ innocence, Darrow realized that the evidence against them was overwhelming and that the brothers were almost certainly guilty. Soon after the arrest, and before he agreed to represent the McNamaras, <b>he</b> <b>confided</b> this to a journalist as the reason {{he was reluctant to}} take the case. Ryan turned to Harriman, who agreed to be the brothers' defense attorney. Gompers, however, visited Darrow in Chicago and convinced him that the case required his expertise. Reluctantly, Darrow consented to be lead defense attorney. Harriman stayed on as his assistant. Darrow also recruited former Los Angeles county assistant district attorney Lecompte Davis, pro-union Indiana judge Cyrus F. McNutt, and president of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Joseph Scott as co-counsel for the defense.|$|E
