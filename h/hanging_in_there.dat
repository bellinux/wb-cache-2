50|$|In 1954, Bourgeois {{joined the}} American Abstract Artists Group, with several contemporaries, among them Barnett Newman and Ad Reinhardt. At {{this time she}} also befriended the artists Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, and Jackson Pollock.As part of the American Abstract Artists Group, Bourgeois made the {{transition}} from wood and upright structures to marble, plaster and bronze as she investigated concerns like fear, vulnerability and loss of control. This transition was a turning point. She referred to her art as a series or sequence closely related to days and circumstances, describing her early work as the fear of falling which later transformed into the art of falling and the final evolution as the art of <b>hanging</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> Her conflicts in real life empowered her to authenticate her experiences and struggles through a unique art form. In 1958, Bourgeois and her husband moved into a terraced house at West 20th Street, in Chelsea, Manhattan, where she lived and worked {{for the rest of}} her life.|$|E

50|$|After {{a series}} of botched <b>hangings</b> <b>in</b> the US <b>there</b> was {{mounting}} criticism of this form of capital punishment and {{the death penalty in}} general. In 1886 newly elected New York State governor David B. Hill set up a three-member death penalty commission to find a more humane form of execution. The committee included Southwick, human rights advocate and reformer Elbridge Thomas Gerry, and New York lawyer and politician Matthew Hale. They explored many forms of execution but in 1888 they recommended electrocution using a Southwick's electric chair idea with metal conductors attached to the condemned person's head and feet. Based on their advice the first law allowing the use of electrocution went into effect in New York State on January 1, 1889. Development of Southwicks idea into a working device was turned over to the New York Medico-Legal Society.|$|R

40|$|Each of us {{have been}} greeted by {{familiar}} words such as, “How is it?” or “Hi, how are you doing?” or “ How have you been?”. These greetings question our general well-being or happiness and are usually answered by statements like, “Fine thanks, and you?” or “Great!” and sometimes “Not so good, but I‘m <b>hanging</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> ”. Imagine, if people started greeting each other with, “Hi, how’s your quality of life?” or “Your quality of life been okay?”. How would you respond? You’d probably think awhile and maybe say, “Fine, thank-you” or “Good, what about you?” and maybe even “Not so great, but I’m <b>hanging</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> ” What do we mean when we talk about our “quality of life”? How do we define it and by what do we measure it by? Is there some way to improve upon it? The difficulty with the “quality of life” concept lies in agreeing on a set definition and naming a set of indicators to measure the concept. Quality means a “degree of excellence” or “inherent, enduring good traits that makes something superior”. How do we define and measure what is “good” and “excellent” in life? Each {{of us have}} basic needs to fulfill in life, yet we also have our own desires and wants in life that contribute to our different lifestyles. The meaning of “quality of life” becomes very personal and subjective because of our own values and attitudes affect our defining “quality of life”. Several of us would differ in the way we define “quality of life” because of our different standards and different perspectives...|$|E

However, stage, film, and television productions {{of some of these}} mysteries were traditionally sanitized with the culprits not evading some form of justice, for a variety of reasons– e.g., censors, plot clarity, and Christie's own changing tastes. (When Christie adapted Witness for the Prosecution into a stage play, she lengthened the ending so that the murderer was also killed; this format was followed in screen versions, including the Billy Wilder film from 1957.) In Death Comes as the End, set in ancient Egypt, the culprit is killed by one of the few surviving characters before he can claim another victim [...]|$|R
