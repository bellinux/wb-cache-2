5|$|Liman's directorial {{method was}} often <b>hands-on.</b> Many times he {{operated}} the camera himself {{in order to}} create what he believed was a more intimate relationship between himself, the material, and the actors. He felt that this connection was lost if he simply observed the recording on a monitor. This was a mindset he developed from his background as a small-scale indie film maker.|$|E
5|$|Located at 225 North Avenue NW in Midtown Atlanta, it {{was erected}} in 1888 as the Academic Building, with {{classrooms}} {{to complement the}} <b>hands-on</b> training in the adjacent shop building.

5|$|Nauticus, the National Maritime Center, {{opened on}} the {{downtown}} waterfront in 1994. It features <b>hands-on</b> exhibits, interactive theaters, aquaria, digital high-definition films and an extensive variety of educational programs. Since 2000, Nauticus has been home to the battleship USS Wisconsin, the last battleship {{to be built in}} the United States. It served briefly in World War II and later in the Korean and Gulf Wars.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} values is a focus on <b>hands-on</b> learning. The program emphasizes use of experiential learning activities in the context of outdoor education. These help participants retain what they learn about leadership generally and the eleven leadership competencies specifically. For example, participant teams can be challenged to build foot bridges, complete a hike, build a Tyrolean Traverse, cook a meal, or other practical challenges.|$|E
5|$|Pratt's {{curriculum}} is narrower in scope, but still accommodates double majors {{in a variety}} of disciplines. The school emphasizes undergraduate research—opportunities for <b>hands-on</b> experiences arise through internships, fellowship programs, and the structured curriculum. More than 27 percent of Pratt undergraduates study abroad, small compared to about half of Trinity undergraduates, but much larger than the recent national average for engineering students (3.2%).|$|E
5|$|Raymond {{developed}} a prospectus for aspiring architects {{to come and}} live and study at New Hope and he attracted at least 20. In addition to teaching practical design solutions, the apprentices had <b>hands-on</b> work with various building trades. Farm work and hay making contributed a physical aspect. Students included Junzō Yoshimura and Carl Graffunder, and the farm was visited by people like Eero Saarinen and Alvar Aalto.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 {{expansion}} of the museum made space for a new education center named Art Connections. Art Connections has allowed thousands of local schoolchildren an art education experience through <b>hands-on</b> experiences, art classes, and special tours for students. In 1994, Art Connections received the National Award for Museum Service from the Institute of Museum and Library Services for outstanding community service.|$|E
5|$|The National Scouting Museum {{is located}} in Irving, Texas.

5|$|The Very Special Arts Festival is {{an annual}} festival for special {{education}} students hosted at the Cummer Museum that saw over 2,000 students and 1,000 volunteers in 2014. Guided by museum volunteers, students engage in <b>hands-on</b> art projects, {{some of which have}} gone on to be displayed in the museum.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} final phase was {{operational}} training for the astronauts. This focused on giving them <b>hands-on</b> experience using the instruments and equipment required during their spaceflight. They received training in the effects of microgravity and rapid acceleration. The astronauts spent time in simulators, aboard cargo planes that simulated weightlessness, underwater to practice extravehicular activities (EVAs), and on visits to manufacturing plants {{to check on the}} progress of the hardware.|$|E
5|$|Always {{seeking to}} engage {{individuals}} {{both physically and}} mentally, the program uses the hurdle method. The hurdle method teaches individuals how to nimbly respond situation for which they have not specifically prepared themselves. The manager of learning prepared and present unexpected tasks or challenges to the leader and the group which they must organize themselves {{to find a solution}} or to complete a task. The hurdle method is closely linked to <b>hands-on</b> learning.|$|E
5|$|Carney's {{appointment}} to diplomatic postings {{in countries that}} had often difficult relations with the United States earned him both praise and criticism from observers for his <b>hands-on</b> diplomatic style. His strong views on Iraq's reconstruction efforts after the war in 2003 were in part responsible for a wholesale change in the Bush administration's strategy to stabilize the war-torn nation. He also advocated engagement with Sudan {{at a time when}} White House officials and the C.I.A. wanted the U.S. Embassy closed in Khartoum.|$|E
5|$|Holly Lodge also {{includes}} the Holly Lodge Centre, an organisation which {{provides an opportunity for}} people of all ages and abilities to enjoy and learn from a series of <b>hands-on</b> experiences, focusing particularly on the environment and in the Victorian history and heritage of Richmond Park. The Centre, which is wheelchair-accessible throughout, was opened in 1994.

A registered charity, the Holly Lodge Centre received the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 Capuano ran {{for mayor}} {{a third time}} in and won. Capuano served as mayor from 1990 to 1999, where he earned a {{reputation}} as a <b>hands-on</b> administrator. One of his priorities was to lower the city's population density, which at time was the highest of any New England municipality, by using state grants to demolish several buildings and replace them with playgrounds and parking spaces. As mayor, Capuano oversaw the reduction of school class sizes to a maximum of 19 students.|$|E
5|$|Lee's {{original}} {{plan called for}} Hood and McLaws to attack in concert, but Longstreet held back McLaws while Hood's attack progressed. Around 5 p.m., Longstreet saw that Hood's division was reaching its limits and that the enemy to its front was fully engaged. He ordered McLaws to send in Kershaw's brigade, with Barksdale's to follow on the left, beginning the en echelon attackone brigade after another in sequencethat {{would be used for}} the rest of the afternoon's attack. McLaws resented Longstreet's <b>hands-on</b> management of his brigades. Those brigades engaged in some of the bloodiest fighting of the battle: the Wheatfield and the Peach Orchard.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical {{pest control}} {{is the use}} of <b>hands-on</b> {{techniques}} as well as simple equipment and devices, that provides a protective barrier between plants and insects. This is referred to as tillage {{and is one of the}} oldest methods of weed control as well as being useful for pest control; wireworms, the larvae of the common click beetle, are very destructive pests of newly ploughed grassland, and repeated cultivation exposes them to the birds and other predators that feed on them.|$|E
5|$|Other {{exhibits}} in the revamped Astrocentre {{included a}} new 50-seat mini-theatre, wall murals illustrating the {{phases of the}} moon, plus {{an increasing number of}} <b>hands-on</b> exhibits and interactive computer-driven displays. There were also displays of astronomical globes, an orrery and pictures of the planets, many taken by contemporary space probes. The Astrocentre also featured the world's first commercial Stellarium, a slowly rotating display containing a 3D representation of almost a thousand stars in our immediate stellar neighbourhood.|$|E
5|$|Other {{museums in}} the city are the Museum of Manila, the city-owned museum that {{exhibits}} the city's culture and history, Museo Pambata, a children's museum and a place of <b>hands-on</b> discovery and fun learning, the Museum of Philippine Political History, which exhibits notable political events in the country, and Plaza San Luis, an outdoor heritage public museum that contains a collection of nine Spanish Bahay na Bató houses. Ecclesiastical museums in the located {{in the city}} are the Parish of the Our Lady of the Abandoned in Santa Ana, the San Agustin Church Museum and the upcoming Museo de Intramuros which was housed in the reconstructed San Ignacio Church and Convent.|$|E
5|$|Phase one of {{training}} for the third group of astronauts began in 1964 in lecture halls. Lectures in several fields were supplemented with trips to locations with geological significance so the astronauts gained <b>hands-on</b> experience. In addition to piloting the spacecraft, the astronauts would also perform scientific experiments and measurements on the Moon. The astronauts traveled from the Grand Canyon to learn about geography {{all the way to}} Alaska, Iceland, and Hawaii to learn about rock formations and lava flows.|$|E
5|$|The Ann Arbor <b>Hands-On</b> Museum {{is located}} in a renovated and {{expanded}} historic downtown fire station. Multiple art galleries exist in the city, notably in the downtown area and around the University of Michigan campus.

Other features include the Owls Creek salt marsh and a nature trail.|$|E
5|$|The White Stag Leadership Development Program, {{founded in}} 1958, is {{a summer camp}} for youth 11-18 led by two California-based non-profits that sponsor {{leadership}} development activities. The teen youth staff of the two programs develop and produce several week-long leadership summer camps every year for several hundred youth from Central and Northern California and a few youth from other states and countries. The outdoors program is based on <b>hands-on</b> learning methods to develop competencies.|$|E
5|$|The {{adjacent}} {{village of}} Wraxall {{has a couple}} of tourist attractions. Noah's Ark Zoo Farm has displays of exotic, agricultural and domestic animals including rhinoceros, camels, monkeys, reptiles and most recently a giraffe. It offers <b>hands-on</b> experience with animals and a chance to learn about conservation. Tyntesfield, a 19th-century Victorian country house and grounds, was bought and opened up by the National Trust in 2002. An edition of the North Somerset Times is published as the Nailsea Times.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} {{produced}} a number of scientists, including 19th-century chemist Humphry Davy (who worked in Hotwells). Physicist Paul Dirac (from Bishopston) received the 1933 Nobel Prize for his contributions to quantum mechanics. Cecil Frank Powell was the Melvill Wills Professor of Physics at the University of Bristol when he received the 1950 Nobel Prize for, among other discoveries, his photographic method of studying nuclear processes. Colin Pillinger was the planetary scientist behind the Beagle 2 project, and neuropsychologist Richard Gregory founded the Exploratory (a <b>hands-on</b> science centre which was the predecessor of At-Bristol/We The Curious).|$|E
5|$|The city's {{fiscal crisis}} in the 1970s caused {{the rest of the}} park to fall into disrepair. A dearth of funds {{exacerbated}} the pollution of the park. <b>Hands-on</b> education programs at the park were reduced to passive observations of flora and fauna. Elsewhere in the park, excessive foot traffic was eroding the soil in the forests. The stock of younger, replacement trees in the old-growth forest had relatively little diversity compared to other natural forests.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} East Texas Normal College (ETNC) {{comprises}} {{the history of}} the university now known as Texas A University–Commerce from its foundation as a private normal college in 1889 to its acquisition by the State of Texas in 1917. It was founded in Cooper by Kentucky native William L. Mayo, who served as its president from its foundation until his death in 1917, and moved to Commerce after its original campus burned down in 1894. A popular school for active teachers seeking state certification or recertification, it was largely shaped by Mayo's own personal beliefs about education, which focused on participation and <b>hands-on</b> learning instead of memorization or rote learning.|$|E
5|$|To {{preserve}} {{and restore the}} Orangery, the Trust teamed-up with City of Bath College and Nimbus Conservation Ltd in an innovative partnership, whereby 12 trainee stonemasons worked alongside professional craftsmen to hone their skills and carry out the specialist stonework needed. The Trust also introduced workshops for other restoration professionals, academics and eventually opened them to interested members of the public, where all were educated in a <b>hands-on</b> environment in the skills required to repair the building. For this crafts-based training initiative, in 2011 the Trust won a Daily Telegraph sponsored English Heritage Angel Award.|$|E
5|$|We {{need people}} like , he fights the fight... He {{refused to take}} his anti-retroviral {{medication}} unless it was made affordable and available to everyone—a hugely courageous thing to do. Before then, I'd been frustrated because I wanted to be more <b>hands-on.</b> I just feel that TAC are doing it where it needs to happen. It really needed to be given support, and I thought that perhaps I might be well-placed to do it.|$|E
5|$|Willamette Law {{also offers}} a Clinical Law Program that gives law {{students}} <b>hands-on,</b> professional experience in law offices and courtrooms across the country. The program comprises four advanced legal education courses, including specialized clinics in Business Law, Trusts and Estates, Child and Family Advocacy, and Human Rights and Immigration. Clinical Law Program students are taught and expected to demonstrate the highest standards of excellence {{in all areas of}} legal practice, from mastery of substantive legal issues and procedures, to unwavering professionalism and notable service to the greater community.|$|E
5|$|Both models {{include an}} Apple A8 system-on-chip, and an M8 motion co-processor—an update of the M7 chip from the iPhone 5s. The primary {{difference}} between the M8 and the original M7 coprocessor is that the M8 also includes a barometer to measure altitude changes. Phil Schiller touted that the A8 chip would provide, {{in comparison to the}} 5s, a 25% increase in CPU performance, a 50% increase in graphics performance, and less heat output. Early <b>hands-on</b> reports suggested that the A8's GPU performance might indeed break away from previous generations doubling of performance at each yearly release, scoring 21204.26 in Base mark X compared to 20253.80, 10973.36 and 5034.75 on respectively the 5s, 5 and 4s.|$|E
5|$|By May, Harrison {{had agreed}} {{distribution}} terms with A Records {{and was therefore}} able to formally launch Dark Horse Records, although he would remain contracted to Apple as a solo artist, like the other Beatles, until January 1976. After announcing the staging of the Music Festival from India in September 1974, Harrison also confirmed {{that he planned to}} tour North America, together with Ravi Shankar's ensemble, during November and December. Despite his stated aversion to performing live, Harrison would be the first of his former bandmates to undertake a tour of Beatle-hungry America; the expectations that this created, together with his role as a <b>hands-on</b> record company boss, meant that the pressure on Harrison was immense.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to allow the general public to gain a deeper {{understanding}} about THSR, THSRC provides station tour guides who educate visitors about its operation and service. In addition, professional organizations are also permitted to visit the depots and OMC (Operational Management Center) to gain <b>hands-on</b> knowledge about THSR. In 2011, THSRC received 281 groups {{with a total of}} 10,700 people. It also continues to actively conduct experience sharing with its fellow railway transportation operators to enhance the quality of public transportation and create better planning, design and service. By engaging with industry peers, THSRC can pinpoint areas of improvement, with the continual aim of providing high-quality services to its passengers.|$|E
5|$|Morse died in 1940, after 34 {{years as}} director, and several {{years went by}} without a strong local leadership. To ensure a sounder footing for the future, Coonley merged Avery Coonley with the National College of Education (NCE, {{formerly}} the Chicago Kindergarten College and now National-Louis University) in Evanston, Illinois, in 1943. The two institutions had close ties dating back to Morse's Kindergarten College days, and the arrangement {{took advantage of the}} NCE's financial and teaching resources while Avery Coonley provided a living laboratory for teacher training and educational research. Under NCE management, ACS continued to offer a curriculum that emphasized practical learning, outdoor education—including farming—and <b>hands-on</b> activities like automobile repair. German and French were added in 1949, with students beginning conversational French in first grade.|$|E
