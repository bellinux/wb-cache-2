5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements {{from the}} colonial headquarters at Batavia, the Dutch launched an attack in 1635 {{and were able}} to crush opposition and bring the area around present-day Tainan fully under their control. After seeing Mattau and Soulang, the most powerful villages in the area, defeated so comprehensively, many other villages in the surrounding area came to the Dutch to seek peace and surrender sovereignty. Thus the Dutch were able to dramatically expand the extent of their territorial control <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time,</b> and avoid the need for further fighting. The campaign ended in February 1636, when representatives from twenty-eight villages attended a ceremony in Tayouan to cement Dutch sovereignty.|$|E

5|$|Against this fraught background, Philip {{started the}} siege of Perinthos in July 340 BC. Perinthos {{occupied}} a strong position on a hill rising to 56 meters, with its own port. Philip {{did not have a}} large enough fleet to blockade the port, meaning that Perinthos could be supplied from outside; Philip would therefore have to assault the city. Philip's engineers constructed siege towers (some allegedly 80 cubits high), battering rams and mines for the assault, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time,</b> a section of the wall was breached. However, fighting uphill through the city proved difficult, with the rings of houses providing impromptu defence lines for the Perinthians. Aid, both material and military, now began arriving at Perinthos; the Persian king ordered his satraps on the coast of Asia Minor to send money, food and weapons to the city, while the Byzantians sent a body of soldiers and their best generals.|$|E

5|$|By 1981, Gary's wife, {{and then}} Gary himself, had both {{committed}} suicide. At the same time, Hollywood was {{under threat of}} strikes by both the Writers's and Directors's Guilds. Needing enough films to carry the studio through in case the strikes happened, White Dog was one of thirteen films considered to be far enough along to be completable <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> frame. With a push from Michael Eisner, White Dog was one of seven that Paramount put on a fast track for production. Eisner pushed for the film {{to be one of}} the selected ones because of its social message that hate was learned. Producer Jon Davison was less certain and, early on, he questioned how the film was being marketed. Hanson, back on board as the film's screenwriter, suggested that Samuel Fuller be named the film's director as he felt Fuller was the only one available with the experience needed to complete the film on such a short schedule and with a low budget, while still doing so responsibly with regard to the sensitive material. Davison agreed after visiting Fuller and seeing Fuller act out how he would shoot the film.|$|E
5|$|Honorius II died in {{the night}} 13/14 February 1130 in the Roman monastery of S. Gregorio, after a long illness. Cardinal Aymeric {{arranged}} a hasty burial there and immediately called {{the members of the}} committee to the monastery to proceed for the election of a new pope. But Cardinals Pierleoni and Gionata, realising that the commission certainly would elect a supporter of the Chancellor, withdrew from it hoping that a lack of quorum would prevent it from functioning. But Aymeric ignored this fact and the commission assembled with six members only. Despite the protests of Cardinal Pietro Pisano, who was a distinguished canonist, the committee elected one of its members, Cardinal Gregorio Papareschi of S. Angelo, who accepted the election and took the name Innocent II. He was enthroned in the Lateran Basilica early in the morning on February 14. His election was almost immediately recognized by six other cardinals: two bishops (Giovanni of Ostia and Mathieu of Albano) and four priests (Joselmo of S. Cecilia, Petrus of S. Anastasia and Giovanni of S. Crisogono; the identity of the fourth one is uncertain, but most probably it was Gerardo of S. Croce). <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> they were joined also by the next eight cardinals.|$|E
5|$|Such proclamations were {{repeated}} across southern Vietnam and in Cambodia, and notices were posted in Saigon, Phnom Penh, the road between the cities, {{and in many}} community venues in rural communities. Long's supporters presented them {{in the form of}} a royal edict on wooden blocks, declaring their intention to attack French military installations. They called on the people to rise up and topple French rule and said that supernatural forces would aid the independence fighters, saying that an unnamed monk would arrive from the mountains to lead them. At the time, southern Vietnam was beset by heavy corv√©e labour demands, especially with large-scale roadworks in progress. This meant that the peasants had less time to tend to their farmland, and revolts and strikes had been common. The simmering discontent is seen as a reason for Long's ability to gather such levels of support <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time.</b> Long's supporters called on merchants to flee and convert their colonial bank notes into solid copper cash. Word of the planned revolt spread quickly, leading to a substantial depreciation in the currency.|$|E

5|$|The Kiautschou Bay concession, as {{it became}} known, existed from 1898 to 1914. With an area of , it was located in the {{imperial}} province of Shandong (alternatively romanized as Shantung or Shan-tung in English and Schantung in German) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula (Schantung-Halbinsel) in northern China. Tsingtao (Qingdao) was its administrative center. After the farmers and fishermen of the Chinese village sold their buildings and land and resettled in the rural communities further east, the Germans began to develop the area. Wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply were improvements that transformed the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao into a modern German town. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> the area had the highest density of schools and per capita student enrollment in all of China; primary, secondary and vocational schools were funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{remained in}} reserve until April 1918, when German forces attacked {{as part of}} the Spring Offensive. During the Battle of the Lys, the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps was effectively wiped out, leaving a two-mile wide gap in the British lines. The 33rd was ordered into position, and Pinney personally commanded the divisional machine-gun battalion, which‚Äîwith the assistance of various stragglers from retreating units‚Äîhelped turn back a heavy German attack at the Battle of Hazebrouck on 12 and 13 April. For his service in April, Pinney, along with the commanders of the 12th, 55th and 61st Divisions, was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. The 33rd was used to train the American 30th Infantry Division through the summer, but went over to the offensive in September, seeing action at the Battle of the St Quentin Canal, the Battle of Cambrai, and the Battle of the Selle. At the Selle, Pinney organised a dawn attack with improvised bridges, allowing the 33rd to force a bridgehead and successfully clear the opposing bank <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time.</b> The division finished the war in the Sambre valley, and began demobilisation. In February 1919, with the division mostly demobilised, Pinney retired from the army, aged fifty-six, after thirty-five years service.|$|E

They lay from north to south, with Fort Putnam farthest to the north, Greene slightly to the southwest, and Box slightly farther southwest.

5|$|Although {{the saga}} {{states that the}} forces of √ñlvir were {{superior}} in numbers to those of Earl P√°ll, it also notes that √ñlvir's ships were smaller. √ñlvir brought his own ship {{up next to the}} earl's, where the fighting was the fiercest. One of the earl's chieftains, √ìlafr Hr√≥lfsson, attacked √ñlvir's smallest ships, and cleared three of them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time.</b> √ñlvir urged his men forward and was the first to board Earl P√°ll's own ship. When he spotted Earl P√°ll, √ñlvir threw a spear at him, and although it was blocked by a shield, the force of the blow knocked the earl onto the deck. With the fall of Earl P√°ll, a great shout goes up; but just at that moment, one of the earl's best men, Sveinn 'Breastrope', hurled a large stone at √ñlvir, hitting him square in the chest and knocked him overboard. Although √ñlvir's men dragged him from the water, it was unclear to the battlers whether he lived or not. √ñlvir's disheartened men were driven off the earl's ship, and began to withdraw. √ñlvir eventually recovered his wits, but was unable to rally his troops‚Äîthe battle was lost. Earl P√°ll pursued √ñlvir's fleeing fleet into the Pentland Firth, before giving up the chase. Five of √ñlvir's ships were left behind, and were captured and manned by the forces loyal to Earl P√°ll. The earl is later further strengthened by two longships, and his forces swells to twelve ships. The next day, Earl P√°ll sailed to Shetland, where he destroyed Earl R√∂gnvaldr's fleet. Although, Earl R√∂gnvaldr's forces remained on Shetland itself, Earl P√°ll successfully held onto the earldom. Gray stated that these battles were fought in the year 1136.|$|E
5|$|John of Austria, {{the victor}} of Lepanto and {{replacement}} to Requesens, {{had no choice}} but to sign the Perpetual Edict in 1577, accepting the Pacification of Ghent, but later, frustrated by the intransigence of Orange and his supporters, he seized the citadel of Namur and recalled his troops. John's striking victory at the Battle of Gembloux in January 1578, was followed by a tactical defeat at Rijmenam in July, and John himself died of plague in October. However, despite the Spanish failure to exploit militarily the victory of Gembloux, it rendered important political benefits to the royal cause in the Netherlands, as it shattered the unity of the Dutch rebels. As a consequence of the battle's outcome, the leaders of the main families of the Southern provinces lost faith in Orange's cause and the promises of aid made by the English queen Elizabeth I, which meant an important setback to Orange. Aiming to restore the military capability of the Dutch rebels, Elizabeth arranged with John Casimir, son to the Calvinist Elector Palatine, the raising of a German Army under English pay to assist the Dutch troops John Casimir brought to the Netherlands 11,000 men, but instead of fighting the Spanish, he sided with the Calvinist extremists at Ghent and widened the gap between the Catholic and Protestant rebels. The States General also called for help Francis, Duke of Anjou, brother and heir of the King of France, who entered Mons in July 1578, but was back in France <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|The deposed Manuel {{was sent}} to exile at Attaleia in Asia Minor, while his wife Maria was {{allowed to return to}} her father. Despite Theodore's actions and the {{overthrow}} of his daughter and son-in-law, Akropolites reports that John Asen remained favourably disposed towards Theodore due to his passionate love for Irene. Manuel did not remain quiescent in exile; determined to avenge himself, from Attaleia he secured passage through Turkish lands to Nicaea. There John Vatatzes welcomed him and agreed to support him, but not before he secured from Manuel oaths of loyalty to himself. Thus in early 1239 Manuel with six Nicaean ships set sail for Greece, landing near Demetrias in Thessaly. He received widespread support in the province, perhaps even from the local governor, Michael I's son-in-law Constantine Maliasenos, allowing him to raise an army and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>time</b> occupy Farsala, Larissa, and Platamon. Faced with the option of open civil war, Manuel and Theodore eventually came to terms by dividing the territories of Thessalonica among themselves. Manuel renounced his allegiance to Vatatzes and received Thessaly, John and Theodore kept Thessalonica and the remaining parts of Macedonia as far west as Vodena and Ostrovo, and Constantine was confirmed in his appanage of Aetolia and Acarnania. To further secure their position, both Theodore and Michael concluded treaties with the powerful Prince of Achaea, Geoffrey II of Villehardouin.|$|E
