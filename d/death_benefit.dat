5|$|The {{original}} {{insurance system}} devised by McGivney gave a deceased Knight's widow a $1,000 <b>death</b> <b>benefit.</b> Each member was assessed $1 upon a death, {{and when the}} number of Knights grew beyond 1,000, the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase. Each member, regardless of age, was assessed equally. As a result, younger, healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older. There was also a Sick Benefit Deposit for members who fell ill and could not work. Each sick Knight was entitled to draw up to $5 a week for 13 weeks (roughly equivalent to $125.75 in 2009 dollars). If he remained sick after that, the council to which he belonged determined the sum of money given to him.|$|E

On May 1, 1880 the B Railroad, which had the lowest wage rate of any major railroad, established the Baltimore and Ohio Employees' Relief Association, which provided coverage for sickness, injury from accidents, and a <b>death</b> <b>benefit.</b> In 1884, the B became the first major employer to offer a pension plan.|$|E
25|$|Since Dwyer died in office, {{his widow}} Joanne {{was able to}} collect full {{survivor}} benefits totaling over $1.28 million, {{which at the time}} was the largest <b>death</b> <b>benefit</b> payment ever made by the state system. If Dwyer had been sentenced, state law would have prohibited the payment of his state-provided pension benefits. A spokesman for Dwyer suggested that he may have committed suicide to preserve the pension benefits for his family, whose finances had been ruined by legal defense costs. Other statements made by friends and family also suggest that this was Dwyer's motivation.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services {{set up the}} National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) in 1988 to {{compensate}} individuals and families of individuals injured by covered childhood vaccines. The VICP was adopted in response to concerns over the pertussis portion of the DPT vaccine. Several U.S. lawsuits against vaccine makers won substantial awards. Most makers ceased production, and the last remaining major manufacturer threatened to do so. The VICP uses a no-fault system for resolving vaccine injury claims. Compensation covers medical and legal expenses, loss of future earning capacity, and up to $250,000 for pain and suffering; a <b>death</b> <b>benefit</b> of up to $250,000 is available. If certain minimal requirements are met, legal expenses are compensated even for unsuccessful claims. Since 1988, {{the program has been}} funded by an excise tax of 75 cents on every purchased dose of covered vaccine. To win an award, a claimant must have experienced an injury that is named as a vaccine injury in a table included in the law within the required time period or show a causal connection. The burden of proof is the civil law preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, in other words a showing that causation was more likely than not. Denied claims can be pursued in civil courts, though this is rare.|$|E
2500|$|Because of the tax-free {{nature of}} death benefits, the IRC prohibits the {{deduction}} of the premiums paid for life insurance when the premium payor {{is also the}} beneficiary of the <b>death</b> <b>benefit</b> rather than the individual employee and their family. In addition, loans from insurers secured by policy values are not income and earnings credited to an owner's policy values (known as [...] "inside buildup") by the insurance company are not currently taxed (and may escape taxation altogether if such earnings are not distributed other than {{as part of the}} death benefits paid upon the death of the insured).|$|E
2500|$|The Lovestoneites {{organized}} among New York area {{white collar}} workers. In Local 12644, a directly affiliated AFL local in New York, the Lovestoneites led the Progressive faction, which competed for control {{with the official}} Communists and the [...] "conservatives". The Progressive ticket won control of the groups executive board in a landslide in 1935. However, when the local affiliated with the CIO United Office and Professional Workers of America, the UOPWA leadership became dominated by official Communists. In October 1938 Anne Gould, editor of the Progressive Office Worker was suspended by the leadership. She took 500 members of UOPWA Local 16 out and joined the AFLs Bookkeepers, Stenographers and Accountants Union. The office workers involved were principally employees of ILGWU, the Workmens Circle, [...] the League for Industrial Democracy, Union Health Center, Labor Committee for Palestine, the Non-Sectarian Anti-Nazi League, and the Workmens Sick and <b>Death</b> <b>Benefit</b> Fund.|$|E

The bill also increases daily state active-duty pay rate from $75 to $100, and increases the <b>death</b> <b>benefit</b> paid to families of Guard members killed {{in the line of}} duty from $5,000 to $100,000. Additionally, the [...] "Welcome Home Bill" [...] creates a $1,000 bonus for Guardsman and reservists called to active duty in Iraq and Afghanistan since the September 11, 2001 attacks and a $500 bonus for those who were activated for duty elsewhere. The legislation provides a $2,000 benefit for Gold Star spouses and increases the Gold Star parents' benefit from $1,500 to $2,000. High school diplomas will also be granted to veterans who dropped out to enlist in World War II, Korea or Vietnam wars. Romney signed the bill into law on Veterans Day 2005.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} set was twofold: {{to define}} a maximum amount of cash value per <b>death</b> <b>benefit</b> and {{to define a}} maximum premium for a given <b>death</b> <b>benefit.</b> If the maximum premium is exceeded the policy no longer qualifies {{for all of the}} benefits of a life insurance contract and is instead known as a modified endowment contract or a MEC. A MEC still receives tax free investment returns, and a tax free <b>death</b> <b>benefit,</b> but withdrawals of cash value in a MEC are on a 'LIFO' basis, where earnings are withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income. If the cash value in a contract exceeds the specified percentage of <b>death</b> <b>benefit,</b> the policy no longer qualifies as life insurance at all and all investment earnings become immediately taxable in the year the specified percentage is exceeded. In order to avoid this, contracts define the <b>death</b> <b>benefit</b> to be the higher of the original <b>death</b> <b>benefit</b> or the amount needed to meet IRS guidelines. The maximum cash value is determined to be a certain percentage of the <b>death</b> <b>benefit.</b> The percentage ranges from 30% or so for young insured persons, declining to 0% for those reaching age 100.|$|E

5000|$|Reported cash values {{might seem}} to [...] "disappear" [...] or become [...] "lost" [...] when the <b>death</b> <b>benefit</b> is paid out. The {{reason for this is}} that cash values are {{considered}} to be part of the <b>death</b> <b>benefit.</b> The insurance company pays out the cash values with the <b>death</b> <b>benefit</b> because they are inclusive of each other. This is why loans from the cash value are not taxable as long as the policy is in force (because death benefits are not taxable).|$|E

5000|$|... "Flexible death benefit" [...] {{means the}} policy owner {{can choose to}} {{decrease}} the <b>death</b> <b>benefit.</b> The <b>death</b> <b>benefit</b> can also be increased by the policy owner, usually requiring new underwriting. Another feature of flexible <b>death</b> <b>benefit</b> {{is the ability to}} choose option A or option B death benefits and to change those options {{over the course of the}} life of the insured. Option A is often referred to as a [...] "level death benefit"; death benefits remain level for the life of the insured, and premiums are lower than policies with Option B death benefits, which pay the policy's cash value—i.e., a face amount plus earnings/interest. If the cash value grows over time, the death benefits do too. If the cash value declines, the <b>death</b> <b>benefit</b> also declines. Option B policies normally feature higher premiums than option A policies.|$|E
