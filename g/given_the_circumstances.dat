5|$|By {{the time}} United kicked off their final home {{game of the}} season, Arsenal had {{recorded}} a tenth straight league victory at home to Everton and ensured their status as champions {{for the first time}} in seven years. Frenchman Arsène Wenger also became the first foreign manager to get his hands on the coveted trophy since its inception, in only his first full campaign. He completed a double three weeks later by winning the FA Cup, regarded by many fans and pundits alike as unthinkable <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> four months ago.|$|E
5|$|There were no {{casualties}} as {{a result}} of Xavier. In the Solomon Islands, communications to the Temotu province were lost. When communications were restored on October 24, it was reported that there was only minor tree damage on the islands of Utupua and Vanikolo. On Tikopia, crops sustained damage, though the effects were considered light <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Strong and gusty winds, rough seas and moderate to heavy swells were reported within the eastern Vanuatuan islands, however, no significant damage was reported within the islands.|$|E
5|$|According to the police, the {{passengers}} behaved very calmly, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Keč allowed several of {{the passengers}} to use their mobile telephones, allowing {{one of them to}} communicate with the police and keep Sheriff Jan Bergen updated on the situation. Anti-terror police had been called to the scene, and there were plans to storm the aircraft if the situation escalated. After the incident, the police refused to say if they would have stormed the aircraft if Keč followed through his threats to depart to another airport. During the last stages of the incident, another aircraft was parked beside the MD-82, which the police confirmed played a role {{towards the end of the}} hijacking. All communication towards the central government was made to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice, and neither the prime minister of the minister of foreign affairs was ever contacted. No weapons were found on either the aircraft nor on the hijacker.|$|E

5|$|In May 1941 the {{majority}} of Layforce were sent as reinforcements to the Battle of Crete. Almost {{as soon as they}} landed it was decided that they could not be employed in an offensive role and would instead be used to cover the withdrawal route towards the south. They were ill-equipped for this type of operation, as they were lacking in indirect fire support weapons such as mortars or artillery; they were armed mainly with rifles and a few Bren light machine guns. By 31 May the evacuation was drawing to a close and the commandos, running low on ammunition, rations, and water, fell back towards Sphakia. In the end, {{the vast majority of the}} commandos were left behind on the island, becoming prisoners of war. About 600 of the 800 commandos that had been sent to Crete were listed as killed, missing, or wounded; only 179 commandos managed to get off the island. In April 1941 men from No. 7 Commando took part in the Bardia raid, but by late July 1941 Layforce had been severely reduced in strength. Reinforcements were unlikely <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances.</b> The operational difficulties that had been exposed during the Bardia raid, combined with the inability of the high command to fully embrace the Commando concept, had largely served to make the force ineffective. The decision was made to disband Layforce.|$|E

25|$|After World War II, Nomura {{denied that}} he knew {{beforehand}} of the attack. Reportedly Nomura and Kurusu had to personally decode the radioed message of Japan's breaking off the negotiations with the United States (which <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> practically meant war), {{as it had been}} sent from Japan on Monday, December 8 and was received when the embassy's technical support staff was still on Sunday holiday. Nomura stated that this is why he had been unable to deliver the message until after the actual attack had taken place. In his memoirs, Hull credited Nomura with having been sincere in trying to prevent war between Japan and the United States.|$|E

In general, a decision-making unit (DMU) can use not all available technology, but only specific technology <b>given</b> <b>the</b> current physical, social, and human capitals.

25|$|Taxiles and {{his large}} force {{had to go}} north through a defile, before turning into the {{narrower}} valley, between Orchomenos and Chaeronea {{to meet up with}} Archelaus and his forces. The consequence of this was that once Taxiles and his forces arrived, it became impossible for the forces to retreat and instead had to stand and fight. This force was encamped in the valley in a position which allowed the commanders to watch the Roman army. Archelaus intended to pursue a war of attrition, Taxiles with his far larger force, however, was determined to defeat the Romans in battle and insisted on an engagement and, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances,</b> Archelaus was in no position to refuse.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the 1918 strike, Sir Edward Henry, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police resigned and was replaced by a serving soldier, General Sir Nevil Macready. Macready immediately began reorganising the command structure of the police. As far as Macready was concerned the days of the NUPPO were numbered. He had the comforting knowledge that, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> in which his appointment was made, he was to have carte blanche in his dealings with the NUPPO and its officials. Macready did nothing to encourage talks with the union. He refused to recognise both James Marston, the president of NUPPO, and Jack Hayes, the general secretary. As far as Macready was concerned the police had had a grievance that was now settled, and NUPPO remained an unofficial body therefore they were not to be dealt with.|$|E

I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot.

Müller confirmed this in his Eyewitness Auschwitz (1979).

IOC president Jacques Rogge also condemned the Jamaican's actions as disrespectful. Bolt denied {{that this was the}} purpose of his celebration by saying, [...] "I wasn't bragging.
