5|$|In {{the initial}} contest, the 2012 <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses</b> of January 3, {{election}} officials announced Romney as ahead with 25percent of the vote, edging out a late-gaining Rick Santorum by eight votes (an also-strong Ron Paul finished third). Sixteen days later, however, they certified Santorum {{as the winner}} by a 34-vote margin. A week after the <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses,</b> Romney earned a decisive win in the New Hampshire primary {{with a total of}} 39percent of the vote; Paul finished second and Jon Huntsman, Jr. third.|$|E
5|$|Huntsman, {{who held}} no events in Iowa, {{finished}} {{seventh in the}} January 3 <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses</b> with 739 votes, or 0.6 percent; ahead of only withdrawn candidate Herman Cain and minor candidate Buddy Roemer. Huntsman reiterated {{a focus on the}} January 10 New Hampshire primary.|$|E
5|$|Bush won the <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses,</b> and {{although}} he was heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary, he trailed McCain by 19percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum, and according to political observers, he effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary—which according to The Boston Globe—made history for his campaign's negativity. The New York Times {{described it as a}} smear campaign.|$|E

5|$|In the <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses,</b> Keyes did {{not appear}} {{on any of the}} {{election}} totals. Keyes stated that many of the caucus locations he visited did not list him as a choice. His campaign CEO, Stephen Stone blamed much of this on the media and on Keyes's decision to enter the race late. Stone explained that the media would not acknowledge Keyes's candidacy, making it difficult to run an effective campaign.|$|E
5|$|Paul came in 5th {{place in}} both the January 4 <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses</b> (10% of votes cast) and the January 8 New Hampshire primary (8%). With the {{exception}} of the Nevada caucuses January 19, where he came in 2nd (14%) behind Romney (51%), he did little better through the rest of January: Michigan 4th (6%), South Carolina 5th (4%), Florida 5th (3%). On SuperTuesday, February 5, he placed 4th in almost every state, generally taking in a mere 3–6% of the votes although he did better in the northern states of North Dakota (21%, 3rd place) and Montana (25%, 2nd place).|$|E
5|$|The 2008 presidential {{campaign}} of Chris Dodd was launched on January 11, 2007 and ended on January 3, 2008 after a sixth-place {{finish in the}} <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses.</b> Dodd, the Senior Senator from Connecticut, sought the nomination of the Democratic Party for President of the United States. Centering his campaign in the strategically important states of Iowa and New Hampshire, he tried to bring forth a platform of change. Dodd's performance in the opinion polls varied, but in the financial sphere, he had secured some notable and influential endorsements who had sufficiently funded his campaign.|$|E

The national and international media give Iowa and New Hampshire extensive attention, which gives Iowa voters leverage.

5|$|While having name recognition, McGovern {{had little}} funding or staff, {{although}} he did garner critical funding from some celebrities and statesmen. He won a surprise third-place showing in the <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses</b> amidst a crowded field of candidates, but finished fifth in the New Hampshire primary. He announced he would drop out unless he finished first or second in the Massachusetts primary, {{and when he came}} in third behind his former campaign manager Gary Hart and former Vice President Walter Mondale, he made good on his promise. He later endorsed Mondale, the eventual Democratic nominee. McGovern hosted Saturday Night Live on April 14, 1984.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} contest of the {{primaries}} season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders, making {{her the first}} woman to win the <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses.</b> In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin. Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20, but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers. Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27. These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.|$|E
5|$|The Arizona senator {{subsequently}} {{resumed his}} familiar {{position as a}} political underdog, riding the Straight Talk Express and taking advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events. By December 2007, the Republican race was unsettled, {{with none of the}} top-tier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities with different elements of the Republican base electorate. McCain was showing a resurgence, in particular with renewed strength in New Hampshire– the scene of his 2000 triumph– and was bolstered further by the endorsements of The Boston Globe, the New Hampshire Union Leader, and almost two dozen other state newspapers, as well as from Senator Lieberman (now an Independent Democrat). McCain decided not to campaign significantly in the January 3, 2008, <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses,</b> which saw a win by former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee.|$|E
5000|$|January 3 - The <b>Iowa</b> Republican <b>caucuses</b> are {{initially}} declared as {{a victory}} for Mitt Romney.

5|$|Underwood {{announces that}} he will not run for reelection, and advocates for America Works, which he intends to pay for by {{stripping}} entitlement programs. He fails to get the bill through Congress and uses that as a reason to renege on his promise to not run in 2016. Solicitor General Heather Dunbar (Elizabeth Marvel) announces that she will seek the presidential nomination, and actually gives Underwood a battle. Underwood convinces Sharp to get married so she can announce her candidacy, for the sole reason of sapping women’s votes from Dunbar, at which point she will withdraw and accept the nomination for VP. After the presidential debate, in which Underwood publicly humiliates Sharp in order to go after Dunbar, Sharp retaliates by backing Dunbar's campaign. Ultimately, however, Underwood wins the <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gravel did {{not compete}} in the initial 2008 vote, the <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses,</b> but was still {{subjected}} to a false report from MSNBC that he had {{pulled out of the}} race afterward. Gravel did focus his attention on the second 2008 vote, the New Hampshire primary. There he received about 400 votes out of some 280,000 cast, or 0.14percent, before taking time off to improve his health. He resumed campaigning, but fared no better in subsequent states. By the end of January 2008, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Gravel were the only remaining Democrats from the initial debates still running; Gravel vowed to stay in the presidential campaign until November. On March 11, 2008, Gravel continued to remain in the Democratic race but additionally endorsed a Green Party candidate for president, Jesse Johnson, saying he wanted to help Johnson prevail against Green Party rivals Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader. By late March, Gravel had almost no fundraising and was only on the ballot in one of the next ten Democratic primaries.|$|E

25|$|While the 2008 <b>Iowa</b> <b>Caucuses</b> saw {{a record}} turnout for both parties, the Democratic caucus drew more than 239,000 voters, {{almost double the}} Republican total. Entrance polling {{indicated}} that {{a significant portion of}} the turnout came from first-time caucus attendees, as well as attendees under the age of 30; two groups of voters that primarily lent their support to Barack Obama. Women, previously expected to largely back Hillary Clinton, split their vote between Clinton and Obama, the latter of whom actually received slightly more support.

25|$|In 2000, McCain skipped {{most of the}} <b>Iowa</b> <b>caucuses</b> {{during his}} presidential bid, {{in large part because}} his {{opposition}} to ethanol subsidies was a nonstarter in a state where making corn into fuel was a large and profitable business.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Iowa</b> <b>Caucuses</b> are {{the kickoff}} for the {{national}} presidential selection process. Iowa holds a powerful position in that process because it {{can serve as a}} sounding board for the strength of a candidate's campaign. A win in the <b>Iowa</b> <b>Caucuses</b> can validate a candidate or propel them from relative obscurity. In particular the Iowa Republican Caucuses hold the most power when either the GOP is not the party in the presidency or an incumbent is not on the ballot. As Iowa is the first state to cast its votes on the nominee the media often focus heavily on opinion polls from the state to determine which way Republican voters are leaning.|$|E

50|$|The state gets {{considerable}} attention {{every four years}} because the Iowa caucus, gatherings of voters to select delegates to the state conventions, is the first presidential caucus in the country.
