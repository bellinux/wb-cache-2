2500|$|In electronics, a {{transistor}} is a {{semiconductor device}} {{commonly used to}} amplify or switch electronic signals. Because the controlled output power can be {{much larger than the}} controlling input power, the transistor provides amplification of a signal. The transistor is the fundamental building block of all modern electronic devices, and is used in radio, telephone, computer, and other electronic systems. From November 17, 1947 to December 23, 1947, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at AT Bell Labs, underwent experimentations and finally observed that when two <b>gold</b> <b>point</b> contacts were applied to a crystal of germanium, a signal was produced whereby the output power was larger than the input. The manager of the Bell Labs semiconductor research group, William Shockley, saw the potential in this and worked {{over the next few months}} greatly expanding the knowledge of semiconductors in order to construct the first point-contact transistor. Shockley is considered by many to be the [...] "father" [...] of the transistor. Hence, in recognition of his work, the transistor is widely, yet not universally acknowledged as the most important invention of the entire 20th century since it forms today's building blocks of processors found and used in almost every modern computing and electronics device. In recognition of their invention of the transistor, Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain were jointly awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E

30|$|During the {{classical}} gold standard, aggravated levels of {{political or economic}} uncertainty manifested themselves in large deviations of the sight-rate from the mint-par (Clare 1902, p. 98). To uncover how the investment demand for bills of exchange reacted to such events, Table  3 splits the sample into observations within and outside (or on) the <b>gold</b> <b>points.</b> Of note, the vagaries to determine the <b>gold</b> <b>points</b> introduce an important caveat to this approach. Still, for observations laying outside the <b>gold</b> <b>points</b> according to the values reported in the “Exchange rates during the gold standard” section, the top panel suggests that the interest-parity condition as regards the London investment demand for continental bills of exchange {{can no longer be}} rejected for the case of Paris (whereas there is only a rejection at the 10 % level for the case of Amsterdam) 9. Although the London banker was, reportedly, “content with a safe and steady rate of interest” (Thomas 1921, p. 78), sufficiently large opportunities to make a chance profit did, perhaps, give rise to more active short-term investment activity in higher yielding bills of exchange on established financial centres such as Paris. Conversely, according to the bottom panel, the results of (3) differ hardly when distinguishing between observations within and outside the <b>gold</b> <b>points.</b> For the continental investment demand for London bills of exchange, where exchange rate risk was hedged, this distinction should indeed be less relevant.|$|R
