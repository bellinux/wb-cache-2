25|$|Available for {{processors}} and ball <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (BGA) components, clips allow the attachment of a BGA heat sink {{directly to the}} component. The clips {{make use of the}} gap created by the ball <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (BGA) between the component underside and PCB top surface. The clips therefore require no holes in the PCB. They also allow for easy rework of components.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to use solder compatible with both the PCB and the parts used. An example is ball <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (BGA) using tin-lead solder balls for connections losing their balls on bare copper traces or using lead-free solder paste.|$|E
25|$|The 80286 was {{designed}} for multi-user systems with multitasking applications, including communications (such as automated PBXs) and real-time process control. It had 134,000 transistors and consisted of four independent units: address unit, bus unit, instruction unit and execution unit, organized into a loosely coupled (buffered) pipeline {{just as in the}} 8086. The significantly increased performance over the 8086 was primarily due to the non-multiplexed address and data buses, more address-calculation hardware (most importantly, a dedicated adder) and a faster (more hardware-based) multiplier. It was produced in a 68-pin package, including PLCC (plastic leaded chip carrier), LCC (leadless chip carrier) and PGA (pin <b>grid</b> <b>array)</b> packages.|$|E

The maximum load of the soldered joints during temperature change cycles derived FE simulations are in good agreement with experimentally determined points of failure.

25|$|There {{are quite}} a few {{different}} dielectrics that can be chosen to provide different insulating values depending on the requirements of the circuit. Some of these dielectrics are polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon), FR-4, FR-1, CEM-1 or CEM-3. Well known pre-preg materials used in the PCB industry are FR-2 (phenolic cotton paper), FR-3 (cotton paper and epoxy), FR-4 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-5 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-6 (matte glass and polyester), G-10 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-1 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-2 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-3 (non-woven glass and epoxy), CEM-4 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-5 (woven glass and polyester). Thermal expansion is an important consideration especially with ball <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (BGA) and naked die technologies, and glass fiber offers the best dimensional stability.|$|E
2500|$|Interestingly, the Palomino core {{actually}} debuted {{earlier in}} the mobile market—branded as Mobile Athlon 4 with the codename [...] "Corvette".

2500|$|Most flash ICs come in ball <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> (BGA) {{packages}}, {{and even}} {{the ones that do}} not are often mounted on a PCB next to other BGA packages. After PCB Assembly, boards with BGA packages are often X-rayed to see if the balls are making proper connections to the proper pad, or if the BGA needs rework. These X-rays can erase programmed bits in a flash chip (convert programmed [...] "0" [...] bits into erased [...] "1" [...] bits). Erased bits ("1" [...] bits) are not affected by X-rays.|$|E

2500|$|Electrodes {{are usually}} made of {{stainless}} steel or platinum-iridium embedded in a silastic material, and are usually circular with diameters of 2 to 3mm. [...] Electrode positioning varies from patient to patient, and electrodes can come in rows, in a <b>grid</b> <b>array,</b> or can be individually arranged. The number of electrodes necessary and their exact spatial arrangement is often determined in the operating room. [...] Cortical stimulation mapping allows electrodes {{to be placed in}} exact locations to test brain function and identify if stimulation of the brain location causes a functional impairment in the patient. CSM can be completed using anesthetized patients or awake patients.|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{principal}} {{means by which}} touchpads work. In the matrix approach, a series of conductors are arranged {{in an array of}} parallel lines in two layers, separated by an insulator and crossing each other at right angles to form a grid. [...] A high frequency signal is applied sequentially between pairs in this two-dimensional <b>grid</b> <b>array.</b> [...] The current that passes between the nodes is proportional to the capacitance. When a virtual ground, such as a finger, is placed over one of the intersections between the conductive layer some of the electrical field is shunted to this ground point, resulting in a change in the apparent capacitance at that location.

In contrast with a BGA, land <b>grid</b> <b>array</b> packages in non socketed configurations have no balls, and use flat contacts which are soldered directly to the PCB.

50|$|The BGA is a {{solution}} to the problem of producing a miniature package for an integrated circuit with many hundreds of pins.
