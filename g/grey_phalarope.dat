50|$|Because of its {{proximity}} to the Bristol Channel, storm-blown seabirds are occasionally found here, including shag, <b>grey</b> <b>phalarope,</b> and divers and grebes.|$|E
50|$|Birds inhabiting {{the reserve}} include the avocet, <b>grey</b> <b>phalarope,</b> osprey, Dartford warbler, yellow-browed warbler, serin, black-throated diver, hobby, {{peregrine}} falcon, wryneck, hoopoe and nightjar.|$|E
50|$|Species seen: shoveler, teal, lapwing, snipe, goldcrest, {{collared}} dove, wigeon, pink-footed goose, Egyptian goose, black-tailed godwit, <b>grey</b> <b>phalarope,</b> robin, brambling, twite, {{brent goose}} and Pallas's warbler.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{a previously}} unreported feeding association between <b>Grey</b> <b>Phalaropes</b> Phalaropus fulicarius and Basking Sharks Cetorhinus maximus. The observations were made during effort-based visual monitoring from Gwennap Head in southwest Cornwall, in October 2008. Flocks {{of up to}} 50 <b>Grey</b> <b>Phalaropes</b> were seen to follow and aggregate around surface-feeding Basking Sharks, mostly in an area characterised by a prominent tidal-topographic front. It is proposed that <b>Grey</b> <b>Phalaropes</b> were initially attracted to visual manifestations of upwellings and convergence zones over and adjacent to this front (with enhanced surficial prey availability), and then opportunistically used the tall dorsal fins of foraging Basking Sharks as a visual cue to home in on particularly dense prey patches...|$|R
40|$|When the {{icebreaker}} Oden {{passed between}} 39 ° 36 ’S, 57 ° 46 ’W and 39 ° 59 ’S, 58 ° 11 ’W on 20 November 2007, an extraordinary observation was made. A feeding Pygmy Right Whale Caprea marginata, a species rarely seen, {{was attended by}} eight <b>Grey</b> <b>Phalaropes</b> Phalaropus fulicarius, two Slender-billed Prions Pachyptila belcheri, and four Wilson’s Storm Petrels Oceanites oceanicus. The birds returned to feed around {{the head of the}} whale every time it surfaced, presumably copepod plankton straining out between the baleen. The site is off Rio de la Plata estuary where nutrient rich freshwater meets cold water of the Malvinas (Falkland) Current, creating a hotspot with high levels of plankton food. The conditions were extraordinarily favourable for observation with a calm sea, no wind and only a very weak swell. Six multispecies feeding groups were seen with a total of 42 species of birds, eleven species of whales, dolphins and porpoises, and three species of seals. Dusky Dolphins Lagenorhynchus obscurus and Great Shearwaters Puf¿- nus gravis were predominant in the groups...|$|R
50|$|The {{red phalarope}} (called <b>grey</b> <b>phalarope</b> in Europe), Phalaropus fulicarius, {{is a small}} wader. This phalarope breeds in the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is migratory, and, unusually for a wader, {{migrating}} mainly on oceanic routes and wintering at sea on tropical oceans.|$|E
50|$|Despite its size, High Rid Reservoir is, and has been, {{home to many}} {{different}} kinds of bird. During the winter {{many different}} bird species, including little grebe, tufted duck and goldeneye can be found. Sightings, and short term residencies, of greater scaup, <b>grey</b> <b>phalarope,</b> ring-necked duck and long-tailed duck have also been documented.|$|E
50|$|Local and scarce bird {{records for}} the area include: black-throated diver, red-necked grebe, sooty shearwater, Balearic shearwater, Leach's storm-petrel, spoonbill, pink-footed goose, garganey, European honey buzzard, red grouse, dotterel, wood sandpiper, <b>grey</b> <b>phalarope,</b> pomarine skua, long-tailed skua, Sabine’s gull, ring-billed gull, yellow-legged gull, Iceland gull, roseate tern, black guillemot, little auk, long-eared owl, hoopoe, wryneck, waxwing, yellow-browed warbler, golden oriole, great grey shrike, twite and snow bunting.|$|E
50|$|Two species, the {{red phalarope}} (Phalaropus fulicarius, called <b>grey</b> <b>phalarope</b> in Europe) and red-necked phalarope (P. lobatus) breed around the Arctic Circle and winter on {{tropical}} oceans. Wilson's phalarope (P. tricolor) breeds in western North America and migrates to South America. All are 6 - 10 in in length, with lobed toes and a straight, slender bill. Predominantly grey and white in winter, their plumage develops reddish markings in summer.|$|E
50|$|The big {{intertidal}} zone {{is high in}} biodiversity and productivity and has extensive algal forests and other important habitats for fish and invertebrates.The area supports 230 species of vascular plants and around 50 breeding bird species including common shag, glaucous gull, white-tailed eagle, common eider, black guillemot and <b>grey</b> <b>phalarope.</b> The area is important staging area for brent goose and red knot. The common seal and the grey seal have their main haul-out on the islands and skerries.|$|E
50|$|In its history, many {{rare and}} scarce {{migrating}} birds {{have turned up}} {{on the north side}} of the lake. The island that has 3 resident goats to graze the vegetation, is primarily for bird life. Many common bird species breed on the spit that can be viewed from the only hide on the lake, the north hide. Here are some of the most notable visitors to the lake: Red-throated Diver (1986), Great Northern Diver (1994), Fulmar (2001) Great Shearwater (1999), Leach's Petrol (1987), Gannet (2002), Night Heron (1987), Glossy Ibis (1987), Spoonbill (1995), Pink footed Goose (1992), White-Fronted Goose (1992), Green-Winged Teal (1994), Ring-Necked Duck (1996), Long-Tailed Duck (1981), Velvet Scoter (2006), Spotted Crake (1995), Avocet (2011), Kentish Plover (1981), Temmick's Stint (2004), Pectoral Sandpiper (1995), Purple Sandpiper (1977), Red-Necked Phalarope (1995), <b>Grey</b> <b>Phalarope</b> (1987), Wilson's Phalarope (2007), Pomarine Skua (1982), Great Skua (1987), Sabine's Gull (1981), Caspian Tern (2001), Roseate Tern (1994), Whiskered Tern (2001), Cetti's Warbler (2011), Great Reed Warbler (2008), Golden Oriole (1997), Lapland Bunting (1966), Snow Bunting (1997), and a pair of Black-winged Stilt staying the summer of 1988.|$|E
40|$|This {{report by}} the Slovenian Rarities Committee {{presents}} records of rare bird species in Slovenia in 2015, with some addenda for previous years. The numbers in brackets refer {{to the number of}} records (first number) and individuals (second number) recorded between 1 Jan 1950 and 31 Dec 2014. Since 1 Jan 2013, submission to the Committee has been required for 37 additional species, 17 of which are regional rarities. Records of these species are not numbered, since records from previous years were not collected by the Committee. One new species, the Desert Wheatear Oenanthe deserti, was added to category A. Other notable observations were the first record of Parrot Crossbill Loxia pytyopsittacus after 1909, the second record of Baillon’s Crake Zapornia pusilla, the third and fourth records of Calandra Lark Melanocorypha calandra, the fourth of Long-legged Buzzard Buteo rufinus, the fifth of Richard’s Pipit Anthus richardi and the sixth of <b>Grey</b> <b>Phalarope</b> Phalaropus fulicarius. Four species were added to category E: Bahama Pintail Anas bahamensis, Rosy-billed Pochard Netta peposaca, Harris’s Hawk Parabuteo unicinctus and Alexandrine Parakeet Psittacula eupatria. The list of birds recorded in Slovenia (as of 31 Dec 2015) contains 386 species (371 in category A, 6 in category B, 9 exclusively in category C; 4 species are both in categories A and C). Category D contains 6 species, while category E contains 38, two of which are classified into subcategory E*. These two categories {{are not part of the}} list...|$|E
