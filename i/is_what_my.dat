500|$|The apocalyptic wartime {{setting and}} the climactic moment when Jim sees the distant white flash {{of the atomic}} bombing of Nagasaki gave Spielberg {{powerful}} visual metaphors [...] "to draw a parallel story between the death of this boy's innocence {{and the death of}} the innocence of the entire world." [...] Spielberg reflected he [...] "was attracted to the idea that this was a death of innocence, not an attenuation of childhood, which by my own admission and everybody's impression of me <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> life has been. This was the opposite of Peter Pan. This was a boy who had grown up too quickly." [...] Other topics that Spielberg previously dealt with, and are presented in Empire of the Sun, include a child being separated from his parents (The Sugarland Express, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Poltergeist) and World War II (1941, and Raiders of the Lost Ark). Spielberg explained [...] "My parents got a divorce when I was 14, 15. The whole thing about separation is something that runs very deep in anyone exposed to divorce." ...|$|E

This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> {{relative}} told me. [...] It is quite understandable, and I am in agreement with him." [...] He also expresses agreement with Hitler's expulsion of the Jews from Germany.|$|E
2500|$|Field didn't mind {{sharing the}} {{majority}} of the screen time with Hanks and taking on the role of producer because, as {{she said in an interview}} at the time, [...] "as a producer I am not developing films in which I can do fancy footwork. I don't have to have the tour de force part." [...] New York comic Susie Essman and sitcom writer Dottie Archibald coached Field. The writer also served as comedy consultant for the movie, recruiting fifteen comics to populate the comedy club Steven and Lilah frequent. Field's research often mirrored her character's as she remembers working [...] "for about six months to find where Lilah's comedy was, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> character was going through. So it was actually happening to both of us." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You hear! My boy, my poor boy, forgive me; don't {{leave me}} to her," [...] <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> poor father had said--he {{who had been}} so strong.|$|R
60|$|SHARADE My first <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> {{second was}} to King James the 1st, and you tread on my whole.|$|E

6000|$|Blanche was enchanted. [...] "How well I {{must have}} managed it!" [...] she thought. [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> uncle means, when my uncle talks of 'putting it strongly.'" ...|$|E
60|$|And while Eustace marveled if {{this were}} a passing tumult or the {{beginning}} of a civil war, my most immediate wonder <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> mother would say to this adventure.|$|R
5000|$|... 81. One {{ought to}} ask the {{following}} questions repeatedly before beginning any new venture: <b>What</b> <b>is</b> the ideal time?

60|$|For one instant it {{flashed through}} my mind to tell Sally who I <b>was,</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> errand <b>was,</b> after the truth. But the secret was not mine to tell. And I kept my pledges.|$|R
6000|$|... "All this I conceive," [...] said Eviot; [...] "but {{how these}} {{precautions}} can {{be reconciled with}} {{the execution of the}} sentence of hanging <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> dull brain cannot comprehend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye. When it {{is known}} that I live, that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> enemies will call me who lived on for your sake, Miriam--for the sake of a woman who denies me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> {{sister has}} always said," [...] Sue eagerly assented to his {{suggestion}} of this theory. [...] "I suppose it's what I've always believed, too, somehow, or I couldn't have lived." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Music and pictures! Lord, what refined tastes! You <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> wife calls intellectual. I ain't, a bit. But we {{can find}} {{something}} better {{for you to do}} than to sit under a tree. To begin with, you must come to the club." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's war in Spain. I {{hear our}} next move is there. I'll {{try to show}} myself to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> father wished me. I don't suppose I shall--but I'll try in my feeble way. That much I swear--here over his body. So help me God.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1956, a {{reviewer}} {{predicted that}} an alien visiting {{from another planet}} could ask anyone {{between the ages of}} seven and 70 [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>What's</b> <b>my</b> Line?"

She featured in the first revival of <b>What's</b> <b>My</b> Line? which ran for two series from 1973 to 1974.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you {{see those}} two logs? Well that one {{smouldering}} dismally away in the corner <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> life is now; the other blazing and singing is what I want my life to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> {{mother is}} always blaming me for," [...] said Walter; [...] "but really, now, Edmund, doesn't it savour of the crop-ear to be picking one's words to every rogue in one's way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is what we}} {{are trying}} to find out," [...] remarked the Scarecrow. [...] "The object of a race is to see who can win it--or at least that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> {{excellent}} brains think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Father,' she returned, almost scornfully, 'what other {{proposal}} {{can have}} been made to me? Whom have I seen? Where have I <b>been?</b> <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> heart's experiences?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> fellows {{have made}} me," [...] he said slowly. [...] "I tasted hell {{for a good}} many years. It has left me, I suppose, with a depraved taste. Ring up my brokers, Aynesworth! I {{want to speak to}} Malcolmson. He had better come round here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> Lady Queensberry said we {{were last}} night. To <b>be</b> <b>what</b> we <b>are!</b> You know the word for it!" [...] cried the indignant old woman.

6000|$|... "Ay, Mabel, that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> own {{feelings}} say. I am but a poor hunter, I know, untaught and unlarned; but God is as near me, in this my home, {{as he is}} near the king in his royal palace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> {{father was}} doing in and around New York {{before he went to}} war," [...] {{explained}} Andy to Walt Baxter. [...] "He made quite a success of it, too. He was on a whole lot of committees." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{began the}} descent. The morning star was setting, the east grew grey with light. Oh! could {{we get there}} before the dawn? Could we get there before the dawn? That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> horse's hoofs beat out to me.|$|E
60|$|He talked {{as if the}} Hermanns {{had been}} living all their life in a rural hamlet, and I alone had been capable, with my {{practice}} in life, of a large and indulgent view of certain occurrences.

6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> {{mother said}} to dad. But he thinks not. He thinks {{it is more than}} likely Mr. Enos died in debt and left his affairs all tangled up, and that the lawyers want my father to help {{straighten}} them out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may be easy on that score," [...] said Richard drily. [...] "Her faith <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> {{good wife}} taught her, and she hath {{constantly}} attended the preachings of the chaplains of Sir Amias Paulett, who be {{all of your}} own way of thinking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> {{father has}} {{just told me}} of as what may happen, and he never talks nonsense," [...] said Mary, looking up at Fred now, while he grasped her hand as they walked, till it rather hurt her; {{but she would not}} complain.|$|E
5000|$|Responding to the {{criticism}} that he was merely copying Lewis' work, he writes [...] "People said (quite accurately), 'He's just trying to copy Lewis.' I <b>was.</b> This <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>my</b> children wanted. That is, I was trying to copy Lewis at first, but I soon ceased to. Copying gets you nowhere.
