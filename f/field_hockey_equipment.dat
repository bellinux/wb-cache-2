40|$|Published {{research}} on <b>field</b> <b>hockey</b> <b>equipment</b> is scarce. The {{aim of this}} research was to investigate methods for characterising the impact performance of field hockey sticks. Three sticks were used with fundamental frequencies in the range 74 – 154 Hz. Striking an initially still ball with a stick was identified as the preferred method for characterising performance. Impacts were simulated at mean velocities of 19 m/s at toe and 16 m/s at the shaft. The mean apparent coefficient of restitution and standard deviation were − 0. 32 ± 0. 05 at the toe and − 0. 18 ± 0. 02 at the shaft. The foundation work presented here provides the foundations for developing a methodology for characterising the impact performance of field hockey sticks...|$|E
