50|$|Later in 2000, Denmark held a {{referendum}} on whether to abandon their opt-out from the euro. The referendum resulted in a decision to retain the krone, and also set back plans for {{a referendum}} in the UK as a result. The procedure used to fix the <b>irrevocable</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> of 340.750 between the Greek drachma and the euro was different, since the euro by then was already two years old. While the conversion rates for the initial eleven currencies were determined only hours before the euro was introduced as a virtual currency, the conversion rate for the Greek drachma was fixed several months beforehand, in Council Regulation 1478/2000 (EC), of 19 June 2000.|$|E
40|$|The Paper {{discusses}} how the EU accession {{countries should}} pursue full {{membership in the}} EMU: adopt the euro. The key messages are the following: 1) Even {{the largest of the}} accession countries is too small, too open and too vulnerable to speculative attacks to be a viable optimal currency area. 2) Achieving fiscal sustainability is a necessary condition for full EMU membership. It should also be sufficient. 3) Convergence, prior to the adoption of the euro, of an EMU candidate’s inflation rate to its euro area equilibrium inflation rate is helpful but not essential. 4) Real convergence is irrelevant for EMU membership. 5) Participation in ERMII is at best unhelpful. At worst it creates unnecessary risks of financial and macroeconomic instability. 6) The Maastricht criteria for EMU membership include the simultaneous achievement of three nominal objectives: (a) a nominal exchange rate target (to stay, for at least two years, within a ± 15 % nominal exchange rate band centered on a fixed parity with the euro); (b) a short-term inflation target (inflation, for at least one year, to be no more than 1. 5 % above the average inflation rate of the three EU Members States with the lowest inflation rates); and (c) a target for a long-term (ten year) nominal interest rate (that rate not to be more than 2 % above the average of the three EU Members States with the lowest inflation rates, for at least one year). This is two nominal targets too many. It overburdens the monetary authority and confuses the markets. 7) The two-year ERMII participation requirement should be dropped. Instead, upon achieving fiscal sustainability (and preferably also inflation convergence), the EMU candidate should be given a firm date and (exchange) rate for full EMU membership. This will provide a necessary focal point for the markets and will permit the smooth approach of the market exchange rate to the <b>irrevocable</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> with the euro. It should be possible to move into full EMU membership directly from an unrestricted float. 8) Unilateral euroization, {{in the sense of the}} adoption of the euro as a parallel currency and joint legal tender alongside the domestic currency, is not inconsistent with the Treaty, if it does not involve the abolition of the national currency and the unilateral determination of the ultimate conversion rate of the domestic currency and the euro. In addition, it should be possible for the new EU members to negotiate consensual euroization (this could include the immediate disappearance of the domestic currency). convergence; ERMII; EU accession; fiscal sustainability...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{guidance}} paper of the European Psychiatric Association is to provide evidence-based recommendations on the early detection of a clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis in patients with mental problems. To this aim, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting on <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> to psychosis in non-overlapping samples meeting any at least {{any one of the}} main CHR criteria: ultra-high risk (UHR) and/or basic symptoms criteria. Further, effects of potential moderators (different UHR criteria definitions, single UHR criteria and age) on <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> were examined. <b>Conversion</b> <b>rates</b> in the identified 42 samples with altogether more than 4000 CHR patients who had mainly been identified by UHR criteria and/or the basic symptom criterion ‘cognitive disturbances’ (COGDIS) showed considerable heterogeneity. While UHR criteria and COGDIS were related to similar <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> until 2 -year follow-up, <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> of COGDIS were significantly higher thereafter. Differences in onset and frequency requirements of symptomatic UHR criteria or in their different consideration of functional decline, substance use and co-morbidity did not seem to impact on <b>conversion</b> <b>rates.</b> The ‘genetic risk and functional decline’ UHR criterion was rarely met and only showed an insignificant pooled sample effect. However, age significantly affected UHR <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> with lower rates in children and adolescents.

40|$|Knowledge {{concerning}} the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> of tritium gas to tritiated {{water in the}} environment is basic data needed for estimating the risk of exposure to tritium gas. The <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> is affected by {{various factors such as}} the tritium concentration, dust and moisture in the atmosphere, bacteria in the soil, and solar rays, etc. However, the influence of solar rays on the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> has not been investigated hitherto. From this viewpoint, we examined the influence of ultra-violet (UV) irradiation on the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> of room temperature. The reaction vessel (RV) {{used in the present study}} was spherical flask made of Pyrex or quartz. A given amount of the mixture of oxygen and tritium diluted with hydrogen was introduced into the RV and then UV-irradiation was carried out. The partial pressure of the tritium gas was kept constant at 0. 6 Torr (5 μCi/ml) and the oxygen pressure was varied from 20 to 160 Torr. A high pressure mercury lamp was used as a light source. The <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> was determined by the amount of the tritiated water formed. This was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. Only tritium gas was introduced to clarify the contribution of the exchange reaction with the trace amount of water in the RV, however, little tritiated water was formed. The initial <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> of the gas mixture without UV-irradiation was of an order of magnitude of 0. 01 %/day, which corresponded to the tritium decay rate. From these results, it was revealed that the exchange rate of tritium gas with the water adsorbed on inner wall of the RV was negligibly small in comparison to the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate,</b> and that most of the tritiated water formed came from the β-radiation-induced oxidation. In addition, it was observed that with UV-irradiation the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> was about 1000 times greater than that of nonirradiation. In particular, wave lengths ranging from 200 to 300 nm were effective for converting tritium gas. The primary conclusion was that solar rays would play an important role in the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> of tritium gas in the environment...|$|R
