5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{grows in}} grassland habitats, especially wetter areas. But unlike P.cubensis, the fungus does not grow directly on dung; rather, it is a saprobic species that feeds off decaying <b>grass</b> <b>roots.</b> It is widely {{distributed in the}} temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, and has been reported occasionally in temperate areas of the Southern Hemisphere as well. The earliest reliable history of P.semilanceata intoxication dates back to 1799 in London, and in the 1960s the mushroom was the first European species confirmed to contain psilocybin.|$|E

This put further strain on the family, and Beyoncé's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's <b>Grass</b> <b>Roots</b> Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.|$|E
5|$|After the election, {{many analysts}} {{concluded}} {{that it was the}} unity of the opposition parties against Congress, missing in the 1962 elections, that made the difference. The victory is attributed to the electoral alliance between DMK and Rajaji. Even though Congress had done an effective job of managing the state of Madras, the effective <b>grass</b> <b>roots</b> campaigning by the DMK and the political acumen of Annadurai, defeated the Congress and its leader M. Bhaktavatsalam. The popularity of the United Front was so large {{that they were able to}} win an absolute majority in ten out of the 14 districts in the state, while Congress could not accomplish that in a single district. This was largely due to the fact that the United Front was able to capitalize on its growing support in large towns and cities, combined with the decline in Congress support in its traditional Schedule Caste constituencies.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, the Government of the Cook Islands {{identified}} {{the lack of}} funding for sport facilities as a key reason why the nation has not succeeded at international competitions. It believed that investing in sporting infrastructure would enable the nation to be more globally competitive. Netball was not recognised as an Olympic sport until 1995. While official recognition as an Olympic sport {{did not mean that}} it was played at the Olympics, it did mean that the national association and the Cook Islands government could then access Olympic funding to help cover costs for facilities, travel, coaching, umpire training and other <b>grass</b> <b>roots</b> development efforts. The Cook Islands Netball Association is the governing body for the sport in the Cook Islands, and historically, the sport has been administered by women. Most netball courts are owned by the local village or club. With the exception of National Auditorium, all courts are outside. In 1990, the Cook Islands Netball Association had 15 clubs affiliated with it, all based in the southern islands group, including Ngatangia/Matavera, Avatiu/Nikao, Arorangi, Titikaveka, Takuvaine, Tupapa, Outer Islands.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybe semilanceata {{is roughly}} similar in {{appearance}} to P.hispanica, but may distinguished by its mycenoid (Mycena-like) appearance and acute umbonate cap. Although the grassland habitat {{of the two}} species is similar, P.semilanceata does not grow directly on dung; rather, it is a saprobic species that grows on decaying <b>grass</b> <b>roots.</b> P.fimetaria also resembles P.hispanica, {{but it also has}} a mycenoid appearance and has a ring on the stem. In terms of microscopic characteristics, P.fimetaria has larger cheilocystidia that measure 20–32 by 4–8μm. P.hispanica differs from P.liniformans var. liniformans in that it lacks a gelatinous gill edge. P. liniformans var. americana has larger cheilocystidia, measuring 22–33 by 5.5–9μm, and it is known to grow only on soil around herbs, in the Northwest and Northeast USA and Chile. Deconica coprophila (formerly known as Psilocybe coprophila) is a small brownish mushroom that also grows on dung, but it does not contain psilocybin and does not have a bluing stem.|$|E
