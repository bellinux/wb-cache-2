40|$|International audienceThe {{study in}} this paper is {{motivated}} by the detection of control valves with asymmetric stiction resulting in oscillations in <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>loops.</b> The joint characterization of the control valve and the controlled process is formulated as the identification of a class of extended Hammerstein systems. The input nonlinearity is described by a point-slope-based hysteretic model with two possibly asymmetric ascent and descent paths. An iterative identification method is proposed, {{based on the idea}} of separating the ascent and descent paths subject to the oscillatory input and output. The structure of the formulated extended Hammerstein system is shown to be identifiable, and the oscillatory signals in <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> are proved to be informative by exploiting the cyclo-stationarity of these oscillatory signals.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with decentralised velocity <b>feedback</b> for the <b>control</b> of vibration on a flexible structure. Previous {{studies have shown that}} a direct velocity feedback loop with a collocated force actuator produces a damping action. Multiple velocity <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> thus reduce the vibration and sound radiation of structures at low frequency resonances, where the response is controlled by damping. However, if the control gains are too high, so that the response of the structure at the control point is close to zero, the <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> will pin the panel at the control positions and thus no damping action is generated. Therefore, in order to maximise the active damping effect, the feedback gains have optimum values and the loops need to be properly tuned. In this paper, a numerical investigation is performed to investigate the possibility of self-tuning the <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> gains to maximise the power absorbed by the <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> and hence maximise the active damping. The tuning principle is first examined for a single feedback loop for different excitation signals. The tuning of multiple <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> is then considered and the implementation of a practical tuning algorithm is discussed. <br/...|$|R

50|$|Mdm2 also {{acts as an}} E3 {{ubiquitin}} ligase, targeting both {{itself and}} p53 for degradation by the proteasome (see also ubiquitin). Several lysine residues in p53 C-terminus {{have been identified as}} the sites of ubiquitination, and {{it has been shown that}} p53 protein levels are downregulated by Mdm2 in a proteasome-dependent manner. Mdm2 is capable of auto-polyubiquitination, and in complex with p300, a cooperating E3 ubiquitin ligase, is capable of polyubiquitinating p53. In this manner, Mdm2 and p53 are the members of a negative <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> that keeps the level of p53 low in the absence of p53-stabilizing signals.

50|$|Simpler, non-isolated power {{supplies}} contain an inductor {{instead of a}} transformer. This type includes boost converters, buck converters, and the buck-boost converters. These belong to the simplest class of single input, single output converters which use one inductor and one active switch. The buck converter reduces the input voltage {{in direct proportion to}} the ratio of conductive time to the total switching period, called the duty cycle. For example an ideal buck converter with a 10 V input operating at a 50% duty cycle will produce an average output voltage of 5 V. A <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> is employed to regulate the output voltage by varying the duty cycle to compensate for variations in input voltage. The output voltage of a boost converter is always greater than the input voltage and the buck-boost output voltage is inverted but can be greater than, equal to, or less than the magnitude of its input voltage. There are many variations and extensions to this class of converters but these three form the basis of almost all isolated and non-isolated DC to DC converters. By adding a second inductor the Ćuk and SEPIC converters can be implemented, or, by adding additional active switches, various bridge converters can be realized.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAmong the {{different}} techniques {{that are used}} to design self-adaptive software systems, control theory allows one to design an adaptation policy whose properties, such as stability and accuracy, can be formally guaranteed under certain assumptions. However, in the case of software systems, the integration of these controllers to build complete <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> is manual. More importantly it requires an extensive handcrafting of non-trivial implementation code. This may lead to inconsistencies and instabilities as no systematic and automated assurance can be obtained {{on the fact that the}} initial assumptions for the designed controller still hold in the resulting system. In this chapter, we rely on the principles of design-by-contract to ensure the correction and robustness of a self-adaptive software system built using <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>loops.</b> Our solution raises the level of abstraction upon which the loops are specified by allowing one to define and automatically verify system-level properties organized in contracts.

As a result, assumptions about the system operation conditions become more explicit and verifiable in a systematic way...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 132 - 136. In {{high speed}} {{applications}} magnetic bearings offer many potential advantages over mechanical bearings. The type of magnetic bearing {{most suitable for}} energy storage flywheels is selected and analysed {{for the purpose of}} designing <b>feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>loops.</b> A nonlinear as well as a small signal linear model of the "current driven" magnetic bearing with unlaminated magnetic components is derived.

It is shown that workable results are obtained for most practical situations by using linear systems theory, although the magnetic bearing is a nonlinear device. The describing function model enables the designer to identify the mechanisms leading to limit cycles under adverse operating conditions. <b>Feedback</b> <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> designed around the small signal characteristics produce practical results {{in the case of the}} "voltage driven" mode which are superior to that of the "current driven" case.
