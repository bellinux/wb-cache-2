50|$|But Lanier's {{uncontrolled}} tackling {{resulted in}} Chiefs' equipment manager Bobby Yarborough <b>outfitting</b> Lanier's <b>helmet</b> with extra padding. The padding {{was not on}} the inside of the helmet to protect Lanier but rather, as some photos of him in uniform show, on the outside of the helmet to protect the player he was tackling.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, he divided {{his time}} between Japan and Mexico, and in Japan he adopted the gimmick of a bicycling enthusiast, wearing a {{professional}} bicycler's <b>outfit,</b> <b>helmet,</b> and glasses and coming to the ring on a bicycle. He became something of a jobber, losing nearly 20 opening matches in a row to Kenichiro Arai. He also participated in that year's Young Dragons Cup, and {{made it to the}} finals again, but lost to the man who became his greatest foil, Milano Collection A.T. When he returned to Japan, his bicycle was stolen by Sumo [...] "Dandy" [...] Fuji 2000, starting up a feud between them that led into 2001. Saito eventually managed to win his bicycle back, and he and the now-renamed Big Fuji started teaming on and off as the Bicycle Brothers {{for the next couple of}} years.|$|R
5000|$|Kazuya Taki / Taki Rider - An FBI {{agent and}} {{an old friend of}} several Kamen Riders, {{including}} the first. In the first chapter, the absence of a Kamen Rider in America causes Kazuya to take matters into his own hands wearing a motorcycle <b>outfit</b> and skull-logo <b>helmet.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Charlie Hustle: A short supervillain who {{possesses}} superhuman speed. He wears {{a football}} <b>outfit</b> including <b>helmet.</b> Hustle initially {{works as a}} henchman for Bellamy. When Max tries to recruit Mike Whelan to run Coalville, Charlie rips out Mike's heart, and uses a special gas to render Max unconscious, allowing him to be captured by Bellamy. Charlie is eventually captured by Max and incarcerated in his super jail. In jail, his legs are kept broken {{to prevent him from}} using his powers. After Max's prison is destroyed, Max kicks him, sending him soaring off into the distance.|$|R
50|$|Ron Ely's {{involvement}} {{extended beyond}} {{starring in the}} lead role. The portrait of Professor Clark Savage, Sr., in Doc Savage's penthouse headquarters is Ely wearing a vintage safari <b>outfit</b> and pith <b>helmet,</b> with a handlebar moustache. Pamela Hensley made her film debut in this motion picture. Paul Frees, provided the uncredited voiceover narration for the opening title sequence.|$|R
5000|$|The band also {{features}} Kris Goodwin on drums and Robert Troup on bass. Renowned for their volume and respected for their tenacity, they have drawn comparisons to fellow Oz acts AC/DC and The Mark of Cain, {{as well as}} US <b>outfits</b> such as <b>Helmet</b> and Clutch. Ultimately though, they {{stand on their own}} six feet as one of Australia's fiercest, and most fiercely original, hard rock bands.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, current {{researchers}} have correlated helmet design to an amplification of waves that may cause bTBI. Moss et al. (2009) used model human heads <b>outfitted</b> with <b>helmets</b> approved {{for use in}} OEF and OIF and subjected them to blast waves at 194G for 2.1 milliseconds. These helmets, the Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH) feature a mesh netting that offers comfort between the wearer’s head and the helmet’s Kevlar shell. While effective against ballistic trauma, Moss’s group reported that skull flexure is amplified by the air interface between the helmet and the skull. This space may amplify the effects of bTBI, and the group suggested that a foam connection between the helmet and the wearer’s head may diminish {{the effects of the}} peak pressure wave during an explosion.|$|R
5000|$|At Quincannon Meat & Power, Ms. Oatlash, the receptionist, leaves an {{envelope}} on Odin Quincannon's desk. At church, Cassidy brainstorms explanations for Jesse's superpower and asks {{what it feels}} like. Jesse describes it as [...] "all of God’s creation inside of me." [...] At the motel, Fiore and DeBlanc are <b>outfitted</b> in <b>helmets</b> and bulletproof vests, {{ready to deal with}} Jesse. In Quincannon's office, Donnie reads a letter from the owner of a company called Green Acre. Donnie offers to beat up the owner. Quincannon (Jackie Earle Haley) does not reply but tells Donnie to clear his lunch tray. Donnie struggles to pick up the tray with his one good arm. [...] "A right-hand man with no right hand," [...] Quincannon says.|$|R
500|$|In a December 2012 {{episode of}} The Simpsons titled [...] "The Day the Earth Stood Cool", {{recurring}} character Disco Stu wears an outfit {{which is very}} similar in design to Bangalter's. The online role-playing game World of Warcraft references the musicians with non-player characters Guyo Crystalgear and Tivilix Bangalter, which wear distinctive diving suits and helmets based on the duo's signature appearance. In the 2014 animated film , the character Rarity briefly dons an <b>outfit</b> with a <b>helmet</b> {{similar to that of}} Homem-Christo's.|$|R
50|$|The {{fourth and}} final round of each game was a {{lightning}} round, in which the contestants donned motorcycle-style <b>helmets</b> <b>outfitted</b> with a lightbulb and {{a button on the}} forehead. Contestants had to slap the button to ring in. As many questions as possible were asked in the 58-second time limit. The player with the highest score {{at the end of the}} round won the grand prize and returned on the next episode. If there was a tie between two players, a tie-breaker question was asked.|$|R

2500|$|Momoiro Clover Z's {{first single}} after Hayami's {{departure}} was [...] "", {{accompanied by a}} new group image and stage performance. The girls wore <b>outfits</b> with <b>helmets</b> and so-called [...] "transformation belts" [...] reminiscent of Japanese superhero movies, and the music video also borrowed from such [...] "Super Sentai" [...] imagery. In July, Momoiro Clover Z released their first album, Battle and Romance. Later in December, Hotexpress described the band as the number-one breakthrough idol artist of 2011 and stated that the album became a big turning point for them. Next February, Battle and Romance won the Grand Prix at the CD Shop Awards as the best CD of the year selected by music shop employees {{from all over the}} country. Momoiro Clover Z was the first idol group to win the award. On Christmas Day, 2011, Momoiro Clover Z gave a concert at Saitama Super Arena to their biggest audience to date: all 10,000 tickets were sold out.|$|R
50|$|The New American is {{introduced}} in the next issue. Offered as Old Glory's replacement, the New American is secretly an African American man named Jason Fisher. Jason was selected by the FDAA to undergo gene therapy treatments that gave him superstrength and invulnerability, but with a built in weakness: Jason had the pain receptors of a normal human, so {{that if he was}} subjected to enough pain he would die even if his skin remained unbroken. The New American is <b>outfitted</b> in a <b>helmet</b> and a pseudo Astronaut's uniform, because 1962 America was depicted in the series as not ready for a minority superhero.|$|R
50|$|An elite brigade was {{established}} after the 2007 conflict, which {{is regarded as}} the most advanced, well trained force in Lebanon, known as the Panthers (Al Fouhoud). The number of ISF personnel in this rank is kept secret and unknown to both the public and international community. They are mostly engaged in securing hostages, SWAT team raids and fighting terrorists. The Panthers use M4 Carbine, Heckler & Koch G36 and M24 Sniper Weapon System unlike the regular ISF personnel that use FN P90, AK-47s and M16 rifles. M113, VAB armored personnel carriers are also in their use. Uniforms are a Brown/Maroon beret, most of the Fouhouds wear full black <b>outfits</b> with black <b>helmets</b> and goggles.|$|R
50|$|His {{eagerness to}} sign a first NFL {{contract}} had dissipated by 1957, and Varrichione remained unsigned as the Steelers assembled at St. Bonaventure University in Olean, New York {{for the opening of}} training camp. No raise was forthcoming, however, and following a telephone conversation with team president Art Rooney, Varrichione signed on August 6 to play with the Steelers for another year, thereby completing the team's 45-man roster. Three days of practice were missed. Despite revelations that he battled partial deafness which forced him to wear a special <b>helmet</b> <b>outfitted</b> with a hearing aid, the season proved to be another good one for the 240-pound tackle and Varrichione was named to his second Pro Bowl {{at the end of the}} year.|$|R
50|$|The sketch stars John Cleese and Michael Palin in safari <b>outfits</b> and pith <b>helmets</b> at {{the side}} of a lock (Teddington Lock in west London). Both are facing each other and light orchestral music plays while Palin dances towards Cleese, lightly {{slapping}} him in the face with two small pilchards, and returning to his starting spot. After Palin does this four times, he returns to his starting spot and stands still. In traditional British folk dancing, of which this is reminiscent, one would now expect the other dancer to repeat these steps. Instead, the music stops, Cleese reveals his fish - a much, much larger halibut - and clobbers Palin on the head with it, knocking him into the water several feet below.|$|R
25|$|The Indians were poised with cavalry on both flanks, their center {{comprising}} infantry with War Elephants {{which were}} heavily armored and were strapped {{on with a}} castle-like howdah on their back carrying a trio of archers and javelin hurlers towering among or before them in equal intervals of fifty feet to defend the vulnerable flanks. All of the War-Elephants were equipped with fire-hardened leather and quilted armor for protection while their foreheads and trunks bore steel-plates to defend against enemy arrows. The Pauravan Army itself was dressed in flamboyantly hued <b>outfits</b> wearing steel <b>helmets,</b> bright scarves and baldrics wielding axes, lances and maces. King Porus, seated atop the tallest War Elephant selected from his elephant corps, himself was not mounted on Howdah, as he wore a remarkable chain mail armor and hence had no need of the additional protection of a tower.|$|R
5000|$|Captain Satellite was an {{afternoon}} TV program on KTVU-2 in Oakland, California. Like many kids' shows of this period, it {{took advantage of}} the interest engendered by science fiction and the early space program. The Captain was played by Bob March, a local TV personality. His signature <b>outfit</b> was a <b>helmet</b> and a dark uniform under a light-colored, triangular vest that had a thunderbolt passing through a globe. The set was a cutaway rocket ship called the Starfinder II that blasted off each day. Guest children would co-pilot under Captain Satellite's supervision. As the ship orbited on auto-pilot, the children would participate in games to win prizes (found in the [...] "Space Lock"), and in live promotions. Old Thirties cartoons like Scrappy and serials would be introduced between breaks, and occasionally there were special appearances, as when The Three Stooges came to visit the Starfinder II.|$|R
25|$|As in {{the case}} of all Soul {{character}}s, Taki's character creation started with her weapon. During the early development of Soul Edge, Taki was conceived as a Yoshimitsu-like ninja character, armed with a long sword and wearing a loose <b>outfit</b> and large <b>helmet</b> covering her upper face. She underwent several major design changes before the game's release, evolving into an athletic, iron-masked, buxom woman with a chest size of 90cm/E (Soulcalibur IV measurements; her breasts have noticeably grew through the series), clad in a partially armored catsuit. Taki used variations of this outfit throughout the series; by default her primary costumes were colored crimson or navy blue. A cloth mask returns with Taki's primary costume in Soulcalibur, which is the only game in which her breasts are partially exposed. Taki has a demon-themed menpo iron mask with her blue-colored main costume in Soulcalibur III and a similar red costume is featured in Legends. Other demonic motifs have appeared on her armor since Soulcalibur.|$|R
30|$|Recently, data {{based on}} direct {{measurements}} of head impact exposure {{in college football}} players demonstrated that running backs and quarterbacks suffer the hardest and most severe blows to the head, while linemen and linebackers suffer more head impacts during a game than players in other positions (Crisco et al. 2011). Nearly 300, 000 head impacts at three institutions were recorded over three seasons. The researchers measured impacts with standard football <b>helmets</b> <b>outfitted</b> with sensors that recorded such data as head acceleration and impact location which allowed them to quantify the severity and frequency of blows to the head by player position. Offensive line and quarterbacks had the highest and lowest frequency, respectively, of front impacts. In contrast, quarterbacks received the greatest magnitude and the most frequent impacts {{to the back of}} the helmet. Data also suggest that top-of-head impacts have a higher risk of concussion than impacts to the front, right, or back of the head (Guskiewicz et al. 2007). Top-of-helmet impacts might result in causing the cerebellum to impact the base of the skull and recoil superiorly into the cerebellar tentorium.|$|R
