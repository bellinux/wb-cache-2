The compositional {{design of the}} glass-ceramics based on the compositional features of wastes and the routes to increase the percentage of wastes in the <b>glass</b> <b>batches</b> are emphasized. To increase the addition of industrial solid wastes in the glass preparation {{is one of the}} key factors influencing the utilization of the wastes. One way to achieve this is to apply different wastes with compositional complementarity in <b>glass</b> <b>batches.</b> A few successful examples are summarized in this paper to provide good references for the further related research...|$|R

25|$|New {{chemical}} glass compositions or {{new treatment}} techniques can be initially investigated in small-scale laboratory experiments. The {{raw materials for}} laboratory-scale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because the cost factor has a low priority. In the laboratory mostly pure chemicals are used. Care must be taken that the raw materials have not reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment (such as alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides, or boron oxide), or that the impurities are quantified (loss on ignition). Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during {{the selection of the}} raw materials, e.g., sodium selenite may be preferred over easily evaporating SeO2. Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively inert ones, such as Al(OH)3 over Al2O3. Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material. Glass homogeneity is achieved by homogenizing the raw materials mixture (<b>glass</b> <b>batch),</b> by stirring the melt, and by crushing and re-melting the first melt. The obtained glass is usually annealed to prevent breakage during processing.|$|E

The typical physical/mechanical and chemical properties of the <b>glass</b> <b>batches</b> and the composites were measured.

40|$|The kinetic {{aspects of}} batch melting related to grain size, primary melt formation, gas liberation, and quartz {{dissolution}} {{can only be}} characterized by performing laboratory experiments, whereas the thermodynamic aspects can be quantified theoretically. One approach {{to close the gap}} between laboratory and industrial practice is scaling up experiments from the milligram to the kilogram range. In the micro scale (less than 150 mg sample), physical and chemical reactions of one component, as well as binary and ternary systems, can be observed through the differential thermal analysis (DTA), coupled with the thermo-gravimetry instrument (TG). Experiments at the mesoscale are: thermal-optical observations (30 g batch), conductometry (200 g batch), modified batch-free time (50 g batch and 250 g cullet), and kilogram 10 kg tests in which 4 kg batch and 7 kg cullet are involved. The present study aims to investigate whether these methods could be applied to free alkali and B 2 O 3 containing <b>glass</b> <b>batches.</b> The investigated system were the eutectic CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 (CAS) and CaO-MgO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 (CMAS) based E-glass combined with various B 2 O 3 content. The onset of melting or primary melt formation in free alkali <b>glass</b> <b>batches</b> is generated by its eutectic melting, while in soda-lime-silica batch, the onset of melting corresponds to physical melting of soda ash. The last part of the present paper is feasibility study of alternative B 2 O 3 carriers applied in boron containing <b>glass</b> <b>batches.</b> Conventional borax pentahydrate is one of the substance in the list of SVHC (Substance of Very High Concern) under EU REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization of Chemical substances) regulation. For borosilicate batches, no significant impact is observed between the conventional and alternative B 2 O 3 carrier. Ulexite as alternative B 2 O 3 carrier shows kinetic advantages in E-glass and insulation wool glass in terms of early onset of melting and short foaming decay, respectively. However, these advantages could not be seen during industrial trial in insulation wool glass melter tank, due to insufficient ulexite data. Both borax pentahydrate and ulexite batches demonstrate similar behavior in respects to energy consumptions. Furthermore, since ulexite is beneficiated in finely ground powder, it contributes to higher emission level after filtration in an electrostatic precipitator equipment...|$|R

50|$|The first <b>glass</b> <b>batch</b> did not melt properly, and the {{stoneware}} crucible that Littleton {{had made}} to hold the molten glass in the furnace broke apart in the intense heat.

Instead of trying to melt another load of <b>glass</b> <b>batch,</b> Labino re-charged the furnace with the low-melting formula #475 glass marbles that he had developed for Johns-Manville for the production of fiberglass. The marbles, which melted at a relatively low temperature, produced glass that was malleable enough to blow.

30|$|In this work, the {{incorporation}} method was {{integrated into the}} glass-ceramic fabrication process.

The co-presence of these two glass types is reported for several localities of the Mediterranean area in Byzantine times, and, in particular, the REE and trace elements patterns of the Ganzirri samples are extremely similar to those found for Cyprus finds.

In sodium silicate glasses iron commonly exists as an equilibrium mixture of ferrous ions, Fe 2 +, and ferric ions Fe 3 +. The increase of the melting temperature led to the transformation of ferric ions to ferrous ions.

Smaller scale furnaces for specialty glasses include electric melters, pot furnaces, and day tanks.After melting, homogenization and refining (removal of bubbles), the glass is formed. Flat glass for windows and similar applications is formed by the float glass process, developed between 1953 and 1957 by Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers, who created a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered {{under the influence of}} gravity. The top surface of the glass is subjected to nitrogen under pressure to obtain a polished finish.Container glass for common bottles and jars is formed by blowing and pressing methods.

With the increasing of CaO content, the intensity of crystal diffractive peaks also increases. The formation of β-wollastonite crystal could be accelerated by the increasing of CaO.

40|$|While {{selenium}} {{is applied}} as decolorizing agent for flint container glass or tableware glass, {{the retention of}} selenium in glass however is very low. Generally more than 75 % of the total selenium input sublimes from the glass melt and leaves the clay minerals due to the high volatility of SeO 2. Therefore, alternative selenium containing raw materials, which might offer a better retention of added selenium and therefore substantially reduce the emission of selenium, are needed. One possible option is to intercalate suitable ionic compounds containing selenium into clay minerals and using the intercalated compounds as a carrier for the selenium into the glass melt. The intercalation of saponite with a specially synthesized selenonium compound (triphenylselenonium) is described and their performance in the glass melt is partially characterized. Compared to <b>glass</b> <b>batches</b> with ZnSeO 3 the release of selenium could be reduced by about 75 % if the selenonium intercalates are used...|$|R

The bioactivity of the resulting crystalline materials was examined in vitro by immersion in simulated body fluid at 37 °C. An increase of the surface bioactivity of glass-ceramic with the Na 2 O/K 2 O replacement was observed which is attributed to the augmentation solubility of the crystalline sample.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of an archaeometrical investigation performed on 75 black glass beads dated to the ninth–fifth century BC coming from Bologna, Cumae, and Pozzuoli (Italy), and Chotin (Slovakia). The analyses of the major, minor, and trace elements—as well as that of Sr and Nd isotopes performed on a selection of samples coming from Bologna—provided evidence for two different production technologies in Iron Age black glass found in Italy (natron glass, probably produced in Egypt) and Slovakia (wood ash glass, probably produced in Europe). In both cases, the glasses derive their black colouration from the high presence of iron (around 12 % FeO), introduced into the <b>glass</b> <b>batches</b> through the intentional choice of dark sands. The production model appears to be small-scale and experimental, characterised by the use of non-sorted raw materials and poorly defined formulae, producing glass with a high chemical variability.
