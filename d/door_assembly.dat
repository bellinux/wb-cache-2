50|$|ASTM F1450 is a {{standard}} test method for hollow metal swinging <b>door</b> <b>assemblies</b> for detention facilities. This standard {{was created by the}} American Standard for Testing and Materials (ASTM). ASTM International which was founded in 1898, is an international standards developing organization that develops and publishes standards {{for a wide range of}} materials, products, systems, and services. This standard was published by ASTM F33, a committee which specializes in detention and correctional facilities. This method dealt with requirements for test to determine the performance characteristics of swinging detention hollow metal <b>door</b> <b>assemblies</b> of various styles and types of construction. The aim is to test the capability to prevent intrusion, avoid unauthorized access and to resist common types of vandalism in an organization. In this regards, ASTM has simulated repeated exertion of tremendous amounts of impact energy against a door in order to break through.|$|R

50|$|Another {{limitation}} is {{the tendency of}} such doors to distort if not installed correctly. Although very straightforward in application, if the <b>door</b> <b>assembly</b> is not fitted to a correctly made mounting, sealing problems may result. Omitting the reinforcing stiffener on the vessel just aft of the door hub {{is a good way}} to learn how true this is. An autoclave with this type of door features heavily reinforced mountings which keep the door in alignment throughout the machine's service life. The O-ring gasket can be replaced in less than a minute and is fairly inexpensive.|$|E

50|$|Fire {{doors are}} not {{necessarily}} noncombustible. It is acceptable for portions of the door to be destroyed by combustion during exposure to a fire {{as long as the}} <b>door</b> <b>assembly</b> meets the fire test criteria of limiting temperature on the non-fire side of the assembly. This is in accordance with the overall performance goal of a fire rated door to slow fire propagation from one fire rated compartment to another for only a limited amount of time, during which automatic or manual fire fighting may be employed to limit fire spread, or occupants can exit the building.|$|E
50|$|For larger {{volumes of}} {{heat-sensitive}} materials, a modular room-sized vault {{is much more}} economical than purchasing and storing many fire rated safes. Typically these room-sized vaults are utilized by corporations, government agencies and off-site storage service firms. Fireproof vaults are rated up to Class 125-4 Hour for large data storage applications. These vaults utilize ceramic fiber, a high temperature industrial insulating material, as the core of their modular panel system. All components of the vault, not just the walls and roof panels, must be Class 125 rated to achieve that overall rating for the vault. This includes the <b>door</b> <b>assembly</b> (a double door is needed {{since there is no}} single Class 125 vault door available), cable penetrations, coolant line penetrations (for split HVAC systems), and air duct penetrations.|$|E
5000|$|Along with Darrin's {{trademark}} fender line, the Kaiser Darrin had {{entry doors}} that, {{instead of being}} hinged to open outward, slid on tracks into the front fender wells behind the front wheels. Fueled by Darrin's dislike for conventional doors, the designer had taken out a patent on the sliding auto door concept in 1946. To keep the <b>door</b> <b>assembly</b> as simple as possible, no side windows were built into them. The car was equipped with a three-position Landau top, which was also considered novel, and the design on the whole considered by industry critics and writers as beautifully proportioned. The only flaw was considered the car's front grille. High and shell-shaped, {{it looked as though}} the automobile [...] "wanted to give you a kiss," [...] as one writer commented.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} done to a product {{development}} unit of a Finnish elevator technology com-pany and it was focused {{on one of the}} components of the whole elevator, the door sill as-sembly. The study had two goals, the main goal was to introduce and to further develop a test system created for testing <b>door</b> sill <b>assemblies,</b> and the secondary goal was to create a technical documentation about the <b>door</b> sill <b>assembly</b> for training purpose. The main issue with the sill assembly {{is that one of the}} main components of the whole as-sembly, the sill profile, does not have duty ranges. The sill profile is the visual part of the whole sill assembly and it guides the movement of elevator doors. Always when something is introduced to the elevator car, it goes over the sill profiles. There are different kinds of sill profiles available for different kind of use, but at the moment the main issue is that it is not known how much wear each profile can take. This often leads to a situation where wrong kinds of sill profiles are delivered with the elevator. A typical example is that too weak sill profiles are delivered with an elevator expecting heavy use, and eventually the sill profiles breaks down. The test system for testing <b>door</b> sill <b>assemblies</b> was already created before this study wa...|$|R
40|$|A {{generalized}} {{relationship is}} presented for determining air flow rates through narrow gaps around door edges. The relationship provides values of leakage rates for steady, laminar flow through gaps {{over a wide}} range of pressure difference and eliminates approximations associated with the often inappropriate use of discharge coefficients and exponents in the flow equation Q- C A(~p) n. The analysis covers straight-through, single bend and double bend gaps of constant thickness, as well as connected gaps of constant thicknesses. Comparison of measured flow rates for installed stairwell <b>door</b> <b>assemblies</b> with those predicted by use of the relationship shows agreement within 20 percent. The volumetric flow of heated air through simple door gaps has been calculated by use of the relationship. The results show that the flow rate may increase or decrease with temperature depending on gap size and flow region...|$|R

50|$|The {{objective}} of the Shuttle Ozone Limb Sounding Experiment (SOLSE) {{is to determine the}} altitude distribution of ozone in an attempt to understand its behavior so that quantitative changes in the composition of our atmosphere can be predicted. SOLSE is intended to perform ozone distribution that a nadir instrument can achieve. This will be performed using Charged Coupled Device (CCD) technology to eliminate moving parts in a simpler, low cost, ozone mapping instrument. The experiment is housed in a Hitchhiker (HH/GAS) canister with canister extension ring and equipped with a Hitchhiker Motorized <b>Door</b> <b>Assembly</b> (HMDA). Instrumentation includes an Ultraviolet (UV) spectrograph with a CCD array detector, CCD array and visible light cameras, calibration lamp, optics and baffling. Once on orbit a crew member will active SOLSE which will perform limb and Earth viewing observations. Limb observations focuses on the region 20 km to 50 km altitude above the horizon for the Earth's surface. Earth viewing observations will enable SOLSE to correlate the data with other nadir viewing, ozone instruments.|$|E
