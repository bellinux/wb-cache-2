5|$|The {{shells of}} Amphidromus are {{relatively}} large, {{from one to}} three inches high, and colorful. Amphidromus has an elongate-conic or ovate-conic <b>helicoid</b> shell of 5 to 8 whorls. The shell may be thin and fragile, or very heavy and solid, with no known correlation of shell structure with distribution or habitats.|$|E
25|$|The {{shells of}} {{species in the}} {{subgenus}} Abbottella are small (generally <10nbsp&mm in width), depressed, widely umbilicate and <b>helicoid.</b> The shell is widely expanded, often with a fimbriated peristome. Axial and spiral sculpture is usually present, usually forming cusps or serrations at the intersections. The multispiral operculum has an erect, calcified spiral lamella. The radula has a bicuspid inner marginal, in which the inner cusp is much larger than outer one.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of thylakoids—granal thylakoids, which are {{arranged}} in grana, and stromal thylakoids, which are in contact with the stroma. Granal thylakoids are pancake-shaped circular disks about 300–600 nanometers in diameter. Stromal thylakoids are <b>helicoid</b> sheets that spiral around grana. The flat tops and bottoms of granal thylakoids contain only the relatively flat photosystem II protein complex. This allows them to stack tightly, forming grana with many layers of tightly appressed membrane, called granal membrane, increasing stability and surface area for light capture.|$|E

First of all we will deal with the movement of screw, helix and its tangents. Then we will describe the general area, and cyclic <b>helicoids.</b> Cyclic <b>helicoids</b> split {{the position of the}} surface forming a circle relative to the axis of screw motion. Images complement the all important processes and geometric data. Images are drawn by the program Rhinoceros.

40|$|Cholesteric liquid {{crystals}} experience geometric frustration {{when they}} are confined between surfaces with anchoring conditions that are incompatible with the cholesteric twist. Because of this frustration, they develop complex topological defect structures, which may be <b>helicoids</b> or skyrmions. We develop a theory for these structures, which extends previous theoretical research by deriving exact solutions for <b>helicoids</b> with the assumption of constant azimuth, calculating numerical solutions for <b>helicoids</b> and skyrmions with varying azimuth, and interpreting the results in terms of competition between terms in the free energy...|$|R
25|$|Species in the {{subgenus}} Gundlachtudora have a shell {{which is}} small in size for this family (type species ca. 9mm maximum width, including peristome), depressed, <b>helicoid</b> in shape. The umbilicus is wide. The protoconch is not decollated, {{and consists of}} 11⁄4 smooth, minute whorls. Spiral sculpture is absent (or barely present in the umbilicus). Axial threads on early whorls are widely spaced, and barely perceptible. On the last whorl there is axial sculpture of microscopic, widely spaced grooves. The aperture is double, circular, adnate to the adjacent whorl, and expanded to various degrees. The operculum is multispiral with a thin, oblique lamella.|$|E
25|$|In the helical {{thylakoid}} model, grana {{consist of}} a stack of flattened circular granal thylakoids that resemble pancakes. Each granum can contain anywhere from two to a hundred thylakoids, though grana with 10–20 thylakoids are most common. Wrapped around the grana are <b>helicoid</b> stromal thylakoids, also known as frets or lamellar thylakoids. The helices ascend at an angle of 20–25°, connecting to each granal thylakoid at a bridge-like slit junction. The helicoids may extend as large sheets that link multiple grana, or narrow to tube-like bridges between grana. While {{different parts of the}} thylakoid system contain different membrane proteins, the thylakoid membranes are continuous and the thylakoid space they enclose form a single continuous labyrinth.|$|E
500|$|This {{study of}} nature {{translated}} into {{his use of}} ruled geometrical forms such as the hyperbolic paraboloid, the hyperboloid, the <b>helicoid</b> and the cone, which reflect the forms Gaudí found in nature. Ruled surfaces are forms generated by a straight line known as the generatrix, as it moves over one or several lines known as directrices. Gaudí found abundant examples of them in nature, for instance in rushes, reeds and bones; {{he used to say}} that there is no better structure than the trunk of a tree or a human skeleton. These forms are at the same time functional and aesthetic, and Gaudí discovered how to adapt the language of nature to the structural forms of architecture.

Because the T system maintains a relatively precise alignment with the myofibrillar striations, it follows that the striations must also have a helicoidal arrangement. This has been found before, but has not been widely accepted in recent times.
