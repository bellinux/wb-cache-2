5|$|Game {{development}} {{began by}} late 2008. There was high staff turnover {{from the previous}} Saints Row team with one-fifth of the final 100-person staff <b>having</b> <b>worked</b> on a previous title in the series.

5|$|The {{decision}} to eschew scripts for storyboards {{is one that}} Hillenburg made {{early on in the}} series' development. Rocko's Modern Life had also used storyboarding, and <b>having</b> <b>worked</b> on that series, Hillenburg felt strongly about adopting the process for SpongeBob SquarePants— even though Nickelodeon was beginning to show greater preference for script-driven cartoons.

Barkatullah {{had long been}} associated with the Indian revolutionary movement, <b>having</b> <b>worked</b> with the India House in London and New York from 1903. In 1909, he moved to Japan, where he continued his anti-British activities. Taking the post of Professor of Urdu at Tokyo University, he visited Constantinople in 1911. However, his Tokyo tenure was terminated under diplomatic pressure from Britain. He returned to the United States in 1914, later proceeding to Berlin, where he joined the efforts of the Berlin Committee. Barkatullah had as early as 1895 been acquainted with Nasrullah Khan, the brother of the Afghan Emir, Habibullah Khan.|$|E
5|$|As civil servant, Spruyt made {{an impact}} on the nascent state {{apparatus}} of the Orange Free State. He designed the coat of arms of the state, and laid the foundation of the model state the Orange Free State was to become in later years. <b>Having</b> <b>worked</b> in secretarial functions for the State President himself (as clerk), but also as a servant of parliament, the government, and the State, Spruyt left a clear mark on the early administration and its organisation. Spruyt was also sensitive to good labour relations within the state apparatus, and propagated a rise in the officials' salaries. In this he did not succeed, however, and eventually the matter of the salaries instigated his own resignation. Spruyt felt that his salary was insufficient to live on with a family, and tendered his resignation.|$|E

5|$|Burges entered King's College School, London, in 1839 {{to study}} engineering, his contemporaries there {{including}} Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Michael Rossetti. He left in 1844 {{to join the}} office of Edward Blore, surveyor to Westminster Abbey. Blore was an established architect, <b>having</b> <b>worked</b> for both William IV and Queen Victoria, and had made {{his reputation as a}} proponent of the Gothic Revival. In 1848 or 1849, Burges moved to the offices of Matthew Digby Wyatt. Wyatt was as prominent an architect as Blore, evidenced by his leading role in the direction of The Great Exhibition in 1851. Burges's work with Wyatt, particularly on the Medieval Court for this exhibition, was influential on the subsequent course of his career. During this period, he also worked on drawings of medieval metalwork for Wyatt's book, Metalwork, published in 1852, and assisted Henry Clutton with illustrations for his works.|$|E
5|$|Georg Eduard Albert Krugers (Banda Neira, 4 November 1890 – The Hague, 10 August 1964; {{also written}} as G. Kruger) was a {{cameraman}} and film director {{active in the}} Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia) during the early 20th century. He is recorded as <b>having</b> <b>worked</b> in film since the mid-1920s, and in 1927 he made his directorial debut, Eulis Atjih. He joined hajj pilgrims in 1928 and screened the resulting documentary in the Netherlands. His 1930 film Karnadi Anemer Bangkong {{is thought to be}} the first talkie in the cinema of the Indies, but was a commercial failure as the majority Sundanese audience considered it insulting. After making two works for Tan's Film in the early 1930s, Krugers moved to Hong Kong and then the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|<b>Having</b> <b>worked</b> {{together}} for communist {{organizations in the}} mid-1980s, Faeq al-Mir and Elias Atallah boasted a close relationship {{at the time of}} the arrest. Al-Mir, a human rights activist, led the left-wing People’s Democratic Party, an unauthorized party critical of the Syrian government. Atallah was the leader and sole parliamentarian of the Democratic Left Movement, a leftist Lebanese party. He was also a senior figure in the March 14 Alliance, a Lebanese parliamentary coalition critical of Syrian policies. The two conversed over the phone several times prior to the arrest. They often lamented the assassinations of anti-Syrian Lebanese figures like Samir Kassir. Al-Mir, who was released from a previous ten-year prison sentence related to political activism in 1999, visited Lebanon in 2006 to mourn the killing of George Hawi, a former leader of the Lebanese Communist Party. According to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, this contributed to al-Mir's arrest at the end of the year.|$|E

5|$|<b>Having</b> <b>worked</b> with Cary Guffey on Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Spielberg felt {{confident}} {{in working with}} a cast composed mostly of child actors. For the role of Elliott, he auditioned hundreds of boys before Jack Fisk suggested Henry Thomas for the role because Henry had played the part of Harry in the movie Raggedy Man which Jack Fisk had directed. Thomas, who auditioned in an Indiana Jones costume, did not perform well in the formal testing, but got the filmmakers' attention in an improvised scene. Thoughts of his dead dog inspired his convincing tears. Robert MacNaughton auditioned eight times to play Michael, sometimes with boys auditioning for Elliott. Spielberg felt Drew Barrymore had the right imagination for mischievous Gertie after she impressed him with a story that she led a punk rock band. He enjoyed working with the children, and he later said that the experience made him feel ready to be a father.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Don Kent donned {{the bush}} hat {{and picked up}} the boomerang once more after not <b>having</b> <b>worked</b> as a Kangaroo since 1974, except for the short run in 1977. Costello asked Kent to team up with Bruno Bekkar, who was mostly known from working in his native New Zealand and Australia. Kent and Bekkar worked a tour for the WWC while Costello served as their manager. The team won the WWC North American Tag Team titles from Jack and Jerry Brisco on 22 October 1981. They then lost the titles to Invader I and Super Gladiator but quickly gained them back before {{dropping}} the titles for good to Invader and Gladiator on 26 January 1982. The Kent and Bekkar team only lasted through one tour of the Caribbean, after which Bruno Bekkar returned to Australia and New Zealand to work for the local promotions there.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Savenko {{stated that}} the passed law on the state expert {{activity}} {{and the introduction of}} the profession of forensic expert psychiatrist actually destroyed adversary-based examinations and that the Serbsky Center turned into the complete monopolist of forensic examination, which it had never been under Soviet rule. Formerly, the court could include any psychiatrist in a commission of experts, but now the court only chooses an expert institution. The expert has the right to participate only in commissions that he is included in by the head of his expert institution, and can receive the certificate of qualification as an expert only after <b>having</b> <b>worked</b> in a state expert institution for three years. The Director of the Serbsky Center Dmitrieva was, at the same time, the head of the forensic psychiatry department which is {{the only one in the}} country and is located in her Center. No one had ever had such a monopoly.|$|E
