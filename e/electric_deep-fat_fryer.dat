50|$|On New Year's Eve, Dutch houses {{smell of}} the piping hot oil of <b>deep-fat</b> <b>fryers</b> used to prepare oliebollen and appelbeignets (a kind of apple fritter) - not to be mistaken for the appelflap which is {{completely}} different. Also ananasbeignets (pineapple fritter) are considered a treat. Oliebollen are yeast dough balls, either plain or filled with glacé fruits, pieces of apple, raisins and sultanas are served with powdered sugar and are a special treat for New Year's Eve. In the 17th century, Dutch settlers also took their oliebollen to the American colonies, {{where they are now}} known in a slightly different form as doughnuts. In Limburg nonnevotte are sometimes served during New Year's Eve, although it is mostly eaten during Carnival. Around New Years kniepertjes are popular, in particular in the northern provinces.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to characterize the operation of fan powered infrared burner (PER) at various gas compositions and ambient conditions and develop design guidelines for appliances containing PER burners for satisfactory performance. During this past quarter, a porous radiant burner testing facility consisting of a commercial <b>deep-fat</b> <b>fryer,</b> an FTIR based spectral radiance measurement system, a set of flue gas analysis components, and a fuel gas mixing station was constructed. The measurement capabilities of the system were tested using methane and the test results {{were found to be}} consistent with the literature. Various gas mixtures were tested. Results indicated that the stability limits of the burner and emissions vary with fuel gas composition and air/fuel ratio. However, the maximum radiant efficiency of the burner remained constant. Results obtained from this study can be useful to develop optimum design guidelines for PER burner manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|The aim {{this study}} was to {{optimize}} the deep-fat frying process in order to minimize the oil content incorporated into the food and the moisture in sweet potato chips fried in palm olein and stearin in light of the global trend to consume healthy products with low calories and oil. The process of deep-fat frying results in sensorial characteristics such as smell, flavour, colour and texture which are much appreciated by all ages and social classes, as the oil is incorporated into the food, occupying part of the space left by the water and thus increasing its palatability. Samples of sweet potatoes were washed, peeled, sliced into 3 mm thickness chips and fried in a <b>deep-fat</b> <b>fryer</b> with palm olein and stearin at a proportion of 1 : 30. The sweet potato chip frying process was evaluated according to the rotational central composite design with 2 independent variables: (1) temperature and (2) frying time. The moisture content, colour and incorporated oil content were considered as process-dependent variables. The optimum conditions for deep-fat frying sweet potato chips in palm olein were found to be: temperature of 160 °C and a frying time of 3 min and 30 sec. The chips presented a moisture content of 7. 43 % and oil content of 14. 46 %. For palm stearin, the optimum frying time was the same as that found for palm olein, however the optimum temperature was 180 °C. The chips presented a moisture content of 3. 47 % and oil content of 13. 1 %...|$|R
40|$|No {{doubt about}} it. Americans love French fries. But fries soak {{up a lot}} of oil while they’re turning a perfect golden brown in the <b>deep-fat</b> <b>fryer.</b> Agricultural Research Service {{scientist}} Zhongli Pan and colleagues have tackled the challenge of lowering some of the fat from this favorite side order without skimping on the fries’ delicious taste and texture or their pleasing appearance and aroma. Their idea? After potatoes are peeled and sliced into strips, and just before the raw strips are dunked in the fryer, prep them with 3 minutes of infrared (IR) heat—just like that created in home or commercial IR ovens or grills. The IR prep “forms a nice, microscopic crust on the fries, which helps reduce oil uptake,” says Pan, an agricultural engineer at the ARS Western Regional Research Center in Albany, California. His team has made hundreds of fries— about 20 pounds in all—to determine the best combination of IR heating times and intensities, and deep-frying times and temps, to produce appetizing fries with less oil. In these experiments, Pan’s group used an IR unit with emitters that heated the top and underside of the fries, each a square-cut strip about 3 / 8 -inch by 4 inches. Fries that were prepped with 3 minutes of infrared at 120 kilowatts per square foot, then deep-fried at about 295 ˚F for 7 minutes, had about one-third (37. 1 percent) less oil than fresh-cut fries that were not prepped with IR heat. What’s more, an IR unit that heats all surfaces of the fries—not just the top and bottom—might lower the fries’ fat content even further, according to Pan...|$|R
40|$|A {{de-oiling}} step using a centrifuge ensures {{oil content}} reduction and improves {{the quality of}} fried snacks. A commercial <b>deep-fat</b> <b>fryer</b> with the basket loaded with potatoes and a sample holder was used to fry potato slices, non-pretreated, blanched in hot water (85 ?C/ 3. 5 min) and rinsed in 3 percent NaCl solution (25 ?C/ 5 min). A de-oiling step (350 1 rpm and 457 1 rpm) for 1 min was conducted after the frying (145 ?, 165 ? and 185 ?C or 165 ?C) and cooling (0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 s or 0. 60 and 120 s) steps. Lower frying temperature, higher centrifuge speed, and shorter cooling time resulted in the lowest oil uptake in potato chips. Pre-treatments (blanching and soaking) decreased (5 percent and by at least 10 percent), respectively, compared to the untreated chips. De-oiling led to increased hardness of the chips fried at 145 ? and 165 ?C (0 s cooling time), and the hardness decreased as cooling time. Pre-treatments (blanching and soaking) increased hardness (by 46 percent and 38 percent) and decreased work (by 20 percent and 27 percent), respectively, so that, during rupture, the pre-treated chips resulted in more crunchiness and firmness than the untreated chips. Potato chips showed less lightness and redness when fried at 145 ?C, and more lightness and redness when fried at 185 ?C; yellowness increased b* values as temperature increased. As cooling time increased, the lightness of the chips decreased, and the redness and the yellowness of the chips increased. Pre-treated samples resulted in increasing in lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*), whereas the redness (a*) values of the final products fluctuated. Higher frying temperature, centrifuge speed, and higher cooling time usually resulted in increasing shrinkage in thickness of potato chips; the chips fried at 165 ?C resulted in increasing in thickness. All the fried and de-oiled products resulted in a decrease in thickness, diameter, and volume except for {{the thickness of the}} chip soaked in NaCl, compared to raw slices. A consumer test showed that, blanching and de-oiling without cooling enhanced texture and overall quality of the chip, soaking and de-oiling improved the color, flavor, and the overall quality, and the two pre-treatments did not significantly influence the odor of the chip...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background We {{quantified}} the {{air quality}} benefits of a smoke-free workplace law in Boston Massachusetts, U. S. A., by measuring air pollution from secondhand smoke (SHS) in 7 pubs {{before and after the}} law, comparing actual ventilation practices to engineering society (ASHRAE) recommendations, and assessing SHS levels using health and comfort indices. Methods We performed real-time measurements of respirable particle (RSP) air pollution and particulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PPAH), in 7 pubs and outdoors in a model-based design yielding air exchange rates for RSP removal. We also assessed ventilation rates from carbon dioxide concentrations. We compared RSP air pollution to the federal Air Quality Index (AQI) and the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) to assess health risks, and assessed odor and irritation levels using published SHS-RSP thresholds. Results Pre-smoking-ban RSP levels in 6 pubs (one pub with a non-SHS air quality problem was excluded) averaged 179 μg/m 3, 23 times higher than post-ban levels, which averaged 7. 7 μg/m 3, exceeding the NAAQS for fine particle pollution (PM 2. 5) by nearly 4 -fold. Pre-smoking ban levels of fine particle air pollution in all 7 of the pubs were in the Unhealthy to Hazardous range of the AQI. In the same 6 pubs, pre-ban indoor carcinogenic PPAH averaged 61. 7 ng/m 3, nearly 10 times higher than post-ban levels of 6. 32 ng/m 3. Post-ban particulate air pollution levels were in the Good AQI range, except for 1 venue with a defective gas-fired <b>deep-fat</b> <b>fryer,</b> while post-ban carcinogen levels in all 7 pubs were lower than outdoors. Conclusion During smoking, although pub ventilation rates per occupant were within ASHRAE design parameters for the control of carbon dioxide levels for the number of occupants present, they failed to control SHS carcinogens or RSP. Nonsmokers' SHS odor and irritation sensory thresholds were massively exceeded. Post-ban air pollution measurements showed 90 % to 95 % reductions in PPAH and RSP respectively, differing little from outdoor concentrations. Ventilation failed to control SHS, leading to increased risk of the diseases of air pollution for nonsmoking workers and patrons. Boston's smoking ban eliminated this risk. </p...|$|R
