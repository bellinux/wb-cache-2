The box is partially covered by an old great-coat, with a multiplicity of capes, and some extraordinary-looking clothes; and the straw, with which the canvas cushion is stuffed, <b>is</b> <b>sticking</b> up in several places, as if in rivalry of the hay, which is peeping through the chinks in the boot.

The coachman himself is in the watering-house; and the waterman, with his hands forced into his pockets as far as they can possibly go, is dancing the ‘double shuffle,’ in front of the pump, to keep his feet warm.|$|E

6000|$|Now it {{happened}} one day, {{while they were}} sailing on the high seas, that Trusty John, sitting on the forepart of the ship, fiddling away to himself, observed three ravens in the air flying toward him. He ceased playing, and listened {{to what they were}} saying, for he understood their language. The one croaked: [...] "Ah, ha! so he's bringing the Princess of the Golden Roof home." [...] "Yes," [...] answered the second, [...] "but he's not got her yet." [...] "Yes, he has," [...] spake the third, [...] "for she's sitting beside him on the ship." [...] Then number one began again and cried: [...] "That'll not help him! When they reach the land a chestnut horse will dash forward to greet them: the King will wish to mount it, and if he does it will gallop away with him, and disappear into the air, and he will never see his bride again." [...] "Is there no escape for him?" [...] asked number two. [...] "Oh! yes, if someone else mounts quickly and shoots the horse dead with the pistol that <b>is</b> <b>sticking</b> in the holster, then the young King is saved. But who's to do that? And anyone who knows it and tells him will be turned into stone from his feet to his knees." [...] Then spake number two: [...] "I know more than that: even if the horse is slain, the young King will still not keep his bride: when they enter the palace together they will find a ready-made wedding shirt in a cupboard, which looks as though it were woven of gold and silver, but is really made of nothing but sulphur and tar: when the King puts it on it will burn him to his marrow and bones." [...] Number three asked: [...] "Is there no way of escape, then?" [...] "Oh! yes," [...] answered number two: [...] "If someone seizes the shirt with gloved hands and throws it into the fire, and lets it burn, then the young King is saved. But what's the good? Anyone knowing this and telling it will have half his body turned into stone, from his knees to his heart." [...] Then number three spake: [...] "I know yet more: though the bridal shirt too be burnt, the King hasn't even then secured his bride: when the dance is held after the wedding, and the young Queen is dancing, she will suddenly grow deadly white, and drop down like one dead, and unless some one lifts her up and draws three drops of blood from her right side, and spits them out again, she will die. But if anyone who knows this betrays it, he will be turned into stone from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet." [...] When the ravens had thus conversed they fled onward, but Trusty John had taken it all in, and was sad and depressed from that time forward; for if he were silent to his master concerning what he had heard, he would involve him in misfortune; but if he took him into his confidence, then he himself would forfeit his life. At last he said: [...] "I will stand by my master, though it should be my ruin." ...|$|E
