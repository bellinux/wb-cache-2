50|$|They {{have a great}} {{reputation}} of being the absolute easiest orchid for a beginner to grow. Unlike most tropical epiphytic orchids, this plant comes from somewhat temperate zones and grows in soil rather than on trees and require no extraordinary care to grow successfully. They prefer well drained evenly moist soils that are high in organic material and that never dry out nor remain sodden. They are sympodial growers and will form handsome clumps {{in only a few}} years. Other species and hybrids are occasionally available, the most common being B. striata var. alba, a white variation of the rose-mauve B. striata. Bletilla ochracea, a somewhat rare species from China has unusual flowers with yellow sepals and petals with a red-marked white lip and is becoming more available to collectors. Bletilla Penway Dragon (formosana Ã— szetschuaunica) appears {{to be one of the}} exciting new <b>hybrid</b> <b>grex</b> if it becomes more available.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hybrids</b> {{between a}} <b>grex</b> and a species/nothospecies are named as grexes, {{but this is}} not {{permitted}} if the nothospecies parent has the same parentage as the grex parent. That situation is a back-cross, and the nothospecies name is applied to the progeny.|$|R
40|$|Gene {{expressions}} {{associated with}} in vitro floral transition in an orchid <b>hybrid</b> (Dendrobium <b>grex</b> Madame Thong-In) were investigated by differential display. One clone, orchid transitional growth related gene 7 (otg 7), encoding a new MADS-box gene, was identified to be specifically {{expressed in the}} transitional shoot apical meristem (TSAM). Using this clone as a probe, three orchid MADS-box genes, DOMADS 1, DOMADS 2, and DOMADS 3, were subsequently isolated from the TSAM cDNA library. Phylogenetic analyses show that DOMADS 1 and DOMADS 2 are new members of the AGL 2 subfamily and SQUA subfamily, respectively. DOMADS 3 contains the signature amino acids as with the members in the independent OSMADS 1 subfamily separated from the AGL 2 subfamily. All three of the DOMADS genes were expressed in the TSAM during floral transition and later in mature flowers. DOMADS 1 RNA was uniformly expressed in both of the inflorescence meristem and the floral primordium and later localized {{in all of the}} floral organs. DOMADS 2 showed a novel expression pattern that has not been previously characterized for any other MADS-box genes. DOMADS 2 transcript was expressed early in the 6 -week-old vegetative shoot apical meristem in which the obvious morphological change to floral development had yet to occur. It was expressed throughout the process of floral transition and later in the columns of mature flowers. The onset of DOMADS 3 transcription was in the early TSAM at the stage before the differentiation of the first flower primordium. Later, DOMADS 3 transcript was only detectable in the pedicel tissues. Our results suggest that the DOMADS genes play important roles in the process of floral transition...|$|R
