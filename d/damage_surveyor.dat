2500|$|The {{fast-moving}} nighttime tornado that {{devastated the}} town of Guin, was the longest-duration F5 tornado recorded in the outbreak, and considered {{to be one of}} the most violent ever recorded. The Guin Tornado traveled over [...] to just west of Huntsville before lifting just after 10:30pm CDT. It formed at around 8:50pm CDT near the Mississippi-Alabama border, striking the Monterey Trailer Park, resulting in major damage at that location. The tornado [...] then became extremely violent as it approached and entered Guin, with multiple areas of F5 damage noted in and around town. The tornado first struck the Guin Mobile Home Plant as it entered the town, completely obliterating the structure. Nothing was left of the plant but a pile of mangled steel beams. The town's downtown area was also heavily damaged, with many businesses and two churches completely destroyed. Residential areas in Guin suffered total devastation, with many homes swept completely away and scattered across fields. According to NWS <b>damage</b> <b>surveyor</b> Bill Herman, the damage in one 6-block area was particularly extreme, and remarked that [...] "It was just like the ground had been swept clean. It was just as much of a total wipeout as you can have." [...] Surveyor J.B. Elliot noted that the destruction was so complete, that even some of the foundations were [...] "dislodged, and in some cases swept away." [...] A total of 23 people were killed in Guin.|$|E
5000|$|The {{series of}} events that {{occurred}} as the tornado moved past the Hesston area were most interesting. Eyewitness accounts observed the touchdown of an additional tornado just to the north. This is consistent with models of what is known as a [...] "tornado handoff", in which an old mesocyclone and tornado occlude as a new mesocyclone and tornado further downwind becomes dominant. Over the course of a few miles, the new tornado intensified and the original one abruptly constricted and apparently became a satellite tornado to the new tornado. Eventually, the Hesston tornado (after traveling nearly 48 mi) occluded and merged with the new tornado, and the supercell began to re-intensify. The new tornado rapidly became very large, and violent damage was produced by the second tornado in Marion County. Several homes were again completely obliterated and swept away and one additional fatality was reported. The tornado produced very severe cycloidal ground scouring in farm fields, and damage near the town of Goessel was [...] "extreme F5" [...] according to NWS <b>damage</b> <b>surveyors.</b> The severity of the damage left behind by this tornado led some meteorologists to believe that the Goessel tornado was among the strongest ever documented at that time. The storm passed Goessel and then dissipated approximately 22 mi from its genesis.|$|R
50|$|Continuing northeastward past Vergennes, EF2 damage {{occurred}} {{as a small}} home was largely destroyed, power poles were snapped, outbuildings were destroyed, an antennae was bent, and a dump truck was flipped over. EF2 damage continued as the tornado passed between Dowell and Elkville, with multiple homes and outbuildings severely damaged in that area. The Powerade Park baseball field complex was also damaged. EF1 damage to trees was observed further to the northeast as the tornado traversed unpopulated swampy areas. The tornado passed south of Campbell Lake and then moved into Franklin County, where it dramatically re-intensified to EF4 strength as it crossed Illinois Route 184. A farmhouse at this location was completely obliterated and swept cleanly away, with the debris shredded and scattered 1 mi downwind. The home's foundation was of cinder block construction, though the overall debris pattern was consistent with a violent tornado, as National Weather Service <b>damage</b> <b>surveyors</b> were unable to recover anything larger than a few wooden 2x4s and some pieces of siding downwind from the foundation. Nearby trees were snapped and severely denuded as well. Beyond this point, the tornado weakened to EF1 intensity and caused moderate damage to some homes and outbuildings before it lifted at 02:57 UTC (8:57 p.m. CST) to the southwest of Christopher. With a total path length of 53.47 mi, it was the longest-tracked tornado in the county warning area of the Paducah, Kentucky National Weather Service office in 36 years. In addition to the one fatality, twelve people were injured.|$|R
5000|$|The tornado then {{crossed into}} McClain County, tearing through {{residential}} areas {{along the north}} edge of Blanchard. According to NWS <b>damage</b> <b>surveyors,</b> the tornado [...] "shrunk and tightened to plausibly EF5 strength" [...] as it approached and crossed Kitty Hawk Road, scouring away a large area of pavement. Sections of asphalt were gouged out by high-velocity debris impacts further along the road, and nearby trees were reduced to completely debarked stumps. As the now narrow, but very intense tornado ripped through the front lawn of a nearby house, all grass and several inches of topsoil was scoured away in a narrow swath. Several homes were reduced to bare slabs in this area, and vehicles were thrown up to 600 yards away, including a pickup truck that was torn into multiple pieces. Due to intensity of the damage in this area, surveyors noted that the tornado was [...] "plausibly EF5" [...] as it clipped {{the north side of}} Blanchard, though the fact that the homes swept away were missing some of their anchor bolt washers led to a high-end EF4 rating being assigned instead. Just to the northeast, the tornado maintained its strength as it struck a steel-reinforced concrete dome home, which was shredded by flying debris and sustained partial cracking of its frame. Asphalt was scoured from the home's paved driveway as well. The tornado then weakened to EF3 strength as it crossed Sandrock Road, debarking trees and heavily damaging or destroying several homes in nearby subdivisions. Several cars were blown out from underneath a nearby overpass and mangled. The tornado weakened further as it passed southeast of Newcastle, with mainly tree and power pole damage noted in that area. Additional minor damage to trees, power lines, and outbuildings occurred as the tornado crossed into Cleveland County, executing a loop in a field before dissipating just west of Moore.|$|R
500|$|The tornado quickly {{intensified}} as {{it crossed}} Oklahoma State Highway 92, attaining F4 strength about [...] east-northeast of Amber. Damage {{consistent with this}} rating was sustained over the following [...] of the path before striking Bridge Creek. There, it attained the highest-possible rating on the Fujita Scale, F5. Damage in this area was extreme, as many homes were [...] swept away completely, leaving only concrete slabs where the structures once stood. <b>Damage</b> <b>surveyors</b> noted that the remaining structural debris {{from some of the}} homes in this area was finely granulated into small fragments, and that trees and shrubs were completely debarked. A few of these homes were bolted to their foundations. Extensive ground scouring occurred, and vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards from where they originated, including a mangled pickup truck that was found wrapped around a telephone pole. It was in this area that a mobile Doppler weather radar recorded winds of [...] within the tornado, the highest wind speed ever recorded on Earth. Since the record for maximum winds are reported from only non-tornadic events, however, the [...] wind gust from Cyclone Olivia in 1996 retained the title. About [...] of asphalt was scoured off a road by the violent tornado. Approximately 200 mobile homes/houses were destroyed, and hundreds of other structures were damaged. The Ridgecrest Baptist Church in Bridge Creek was also destroyed in the process. About 12 people died in Bridge Creek, nine of whom were in mobile homes; all fatalities and the majority of injuries were concentrated in the Willow Lake and Southern Hills Additions and Bridge Creek Estates, consisting mostly of mobile homes. Over 39 people were injured in the area as well. Continuing northeastward, the tornado briefly weakened to F4 status before re-strengthening to F5 intensity as it neared the Grady-McClain County line, where a car was thrown roughly [...] in the air, and a well-built home with anchor bolts was reduced to a bare slab. At this time, it had attained a width of [...]|$|R
50|$|The tornado quickly {{intensified}} as {{it crossed}} Oklahoma State Highway 92, attaining F4 strength about 4 mi east-northeast of Amber. Damage {{consistent with this}} rating was sustained over the following 6.5 mi of the path before striking Bridge Creek. There, it attained the highest-possible rating on the Fujita Scale, F5. Damage in this area was extreme, as many homes were swept away completely, leaving only concrete slabs where the structures once stood. <b>Damage</b> <b>surveyors</b> noted that the remaining structural debris {{from some of the}} homes in this area was finely granulated into small fragments, and that trees and shrubs were completely debarked. A few of these homes were bolted to their foundations. Extensive ground scouring occurred, and vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards from where they originated, including a mangled pickup truck that was found wrapped around a telephone pole. It was in this area that a mobile Doppler weather radar recorded winds of 301 mph within the tornado, the highest wind speed ever recorded on Earth. Since the record for maximum winds are reported from only non-tornadic events, however, the 253 mph wind gust from Cyclone Olivia in 1996 retained the title. About 1 in of asphalt was scoured off a road by the violent tornado. Approximately 200 mobile homes/houses were destroyed, and hundreds of other structures were damaged. The Ridgecrest Baptist Church in Bridge Creek was also destroyed in the process. About 12 people died in Bridge Creek, nine of whom were in mobile homes; all fatalities and the majority of injuries were concentrated in the Willow Lake and Southern Hills Additions and Bridge Creek Estates, consisting mostly of mobile homes. Over 39 people were injured in the area as well. Continuing northeastward, the tornado briefly weakened to F4 status before re-strengthening to F5 intensity as it neared the Grady-McClain County line, where a car was thrown roughly 0.25 mi in the air, and a well-built home with anchor bolts was reduced to a bare slab. At this time, it had attained a width of 1 mi.|$|R
500|$|The tornado {{maintained}} EF2 intensity as {{it quickly}} tracked across the Mississippi [...] Tennessee state line and into southeastern portions of Memphis, where WREG tower cameras broadcast live {{footage of the}} tornado moving through the southeastern parts of Memphis, producing multiple bright blue power flashes along the way. By this point, the National Weather Service issued a Tornado Emergency (the first of five to be issued during the outbreak) {{for most of the}} Memphis metropolitan area. The tornado produced an extensive swath of damage as it moved through residential and commercial areas. Considerable damage was reported at Memphis International Airport, where a hangar lost its roof, the FedEx freight terminal's fire station suffered roof damage, airstair trucks were thrown 100yards (91m), and aircraft were moved around, including a Boeing 737 that was moved one foot. FedEx service was disrupted due to flight delays and closed roads, all because of the tornado damage in surrounding areas. The airport weather station's reporting equipment recorded a wind gust of 73knots (84mph, 135km/h). In the Clarke Road area, tractor trailers were tossed around, a power substation was severely damaged, and several warehouse structures sustained heavy damage. This included a DSC warehouse that was destroyed, killing three people inside. Numerous windows were shattered at the Willow Lake Business Park, and utility poles and trees were snapped in the area. Multiple homes along Maple Tree Drive and Pinbranch Court were damaged, five of which sustained major damage. The Hardy Bottling Company facility was also damaged, which released 120,000pounds (54,500kg) of anhydrous ammonia into the atmosphere, although no public health impacts were reported. Continuing northeast, the tornado weakened to EF1 strength and struck the Hickory Ridge Mall, resulting in total collapse of a large wall and much of the roof at the Sears department store. <b>Damage</b> <b>surveyors</b> noted very poor construction at this location, and six people in the mall were injured. Cars and semi-trailers near the mall were flipped and damaged as well. A Taco Bell and a few other businesses were damaged along Winchester Road before the tornado dissipated. Numerous trees and power poles were snapped along much of the tornado's path through Southaven and Memphis, and electricity supply to about 65,000 customers was briefly cut.|$|R
50|$|After {{producing}} the violent EF4 Henryville and Crittenden tornadoes, the same parent supercell entered Campbell County, Kentucky and produced another tornado {{to the west}} of Peach Grove at 4:39 PM. This large rain-wrapped tornado moved east and reached high-end EF3 intensity as it neared the Pendleton County line, damaging or destroying several homes in the area. <b>Damage</b> <b>surveyors</b> noted some modular block foundation homes in this area that were lifted into the air intact, before being thrown in excess of 100 yards and smashed back to the ground, completely obliterating them. 100 mph straight line winds from the parent supercell caused additional damage away from the main damage path in this area as well. After crossing into Pendleton County, the tornado produced a mixture of EF2 and EF3 damage as it passed north of Peach Grove. Multiple homes, mobile homes, barns, and outbuildings along this segment of the path were destroyed, and many trees were snapped and uprooted as well. The tornado then continued across the Ohio River into Clermont County, Ohio, immediately slamming into the small riverside village of Moscow at high-end EF3 intensity. Moscow was devastated by the tornado, with 80% of the village being heavily damaged or destroyed. Numerous two story homes had roofs and exterior walls ripped off, and a few homes in town were completely flattened. Almost every tree in Moscow was uprooted, snapped, or denuded by the tornado. A 64-year-old woman was found dead in the rubble of her home, and several other residents were injured. Beyond Moscow, the tornado continued through rural areas of Clermont County, damaging and destroying many additional homes and outbuildings, snapping many trees, as well and killing two other people in the destruction of a mobile home. The tornado then crossed into Brown County, weakening to EF1 strength as it passed near the town of Hamersville. Damage along this portion of the path consisted of roof damage to homes, damage to trees, outbuildings destroyed, and mobile homes blown off of their foundations and severely damaged. The tornado then lifted to the south of Hamersville.|$|R
50|$|The track {{then moved}} into Tennessee and {{continued}} south of Huntland. Isolated and minor EF0 tree damage was noted {{at the intersection}} of John Hunter Highway (State Route 122) and Limestone Road near the Lincoln/Franklin county line. More significant damage was noted, starting about 1.4 mi south southwest of Huntland. A cinder block building suffered damage to its flat adobe roof, with some of blocks near the roof (around 20 ft off of the ground) pushed out, resulting in EF2 <b>damage.</b> <b>Surveyors</b> could not directly examine the roof given this building was on the highest ground in the vicinity. Nearby, a single-family home of cinder block construction had its roof totally removed, with another home about 1000 ft away having significant roof damage, with over one half of its roof removed, and some shifting off of its foundation. Damage with the latter was consistent with high-end EF2 damage. A chicken building with metal girding near the second home was completely flattened, consistent with EF2 damage. A farm complex south of Hickory Grove road had damage to a number of structures there. The home and the main car garage had part of their roofs removed. A barn that was protecting bales of hay was destroyed, with a few of bales blown from 100-200 feet from their original location. The worst damage was noted with low-end EF3 damage to a well-built cinder block utility building about 200 ft south of the primary residence. Most of its roof was removed, with over half of its downwind wall pushed outward. An older barn nearby suffered lesser EF0 damage to it roof, while the top half of a silo near that barn was missing. Another barn structure was completely destroyed northwest of the primary home. The width at this point was approximately 1/4 mile. Other damage was noted near the intersection of Hickory Grove Road and Sugar Cove Road, with EF1 damage to some heavy farm equipment and EF0 roof damage to a nearby barn. Scattered trees were downed to the northeast, with 8 in fence posts 18 in deep pulled up near Hickory Grove and Buncombe Road. There was evidence the tornado continued toward mountains a few miles further east before dissipating, with some trees damaged along the ridge.|$|R
50|$|The tornado {{maintained}} EF4 {{strength as}} it crossed into Clark County, completely leveling several well-built homes shortly after crossing the county line. However, the tornado weakened briefly {{further to the}} northeast, as two double-wide mobile homes were destroyed at EF2 intensity, while a frame home sustained EF3 damage. One man was killed {{in one of the}} mobile homes shortly after he recorded video of the approaching tornado. Outbuildings were destroyed, and a few other homes along this segment of the path sustained minor to moderate damage. As the tornado crossed Interstate 65, it restrengthened to EF4 intensity and serious injuries occurred as multiple vehicles were tossed and semi-trucks were flipped. The highway was closed for hours, and multiple people had to be extracted from their crumpled vehicles. Immediately east of the interstate, the tornado ripped through the town of Henryville, resulting in devastating damage throughout the town. The Henryville school complex {{was in the process of}} dismissing as the tornado approached the community, and sustained EF4 structural damage including total destruction of its cafeteria. Most of the staff and students had already left the area by the time the tornado struck, but a small group of students rode out the tornado inside the school as it was destroyed around them, and survived without injury. Many cars in the school parking lot were thrown and destroyed, one of which had a wooden beam speared through its hood and out of its undercarriage. Low-level winds in this area were so intense that debris was found wedged underneath plastic reflective strips in the parking lot. School buses were thrown hundreds of feet away, and two were ripped from their chassis. One of these buses was thrown through the front wall of a nearby restaurant, while a gas station and several other businesses and structures in town were severely damaged or destroyed. Numerous homes in and around Henryville were destroyed, and some were flattened or swept from their foundations. Some large metal industrial buildings were destroyed in town as well. The tornado was at its most intense in the Henryville area, with winds estimated at 175 mph. <b>Damage</b> <b>surveyors</b> found evidence of very intense multiple vortices as the tornado entered the community. Massive deforestation occurred in heavily wooded areas around town, and debris from Henryville was found as far east as Ohio.|$|R

40|$|Each {{of the six}} Apollo mission landers {{touched down}} at unique sites on the lunar surface. Aside from the Apollo 12 landing site located 180 meters from the Surveyor III lander, plume {{impingement}} effects on ground hardware during the landings were largely not an issue. The Constellation Project's planned return to the moon requires numerous landings at the same site. Since the top few centimeters are loosely packed regolith, plume impingement from the lander ejects the granular material at high velocities. With high vacuum conditions on the moon (10 (exp - 14) to 10 (epx - 12) torr), motion of all particles is completely ballistic. Estimates from <b>damage</b> to the <b>Surveyor</b> III show that the ejected regolith particles to be anywhere 400 m/s to 2500 m/s. It is imperative to understand the physics of plume impingement to safely design landing sites for the Constellation Program...|$|R
500|$|In 1742 a Sugar House {{was built}} {{against the wall}} of the College. This {{structure}} was a fire risk and the cause of great anxiety among the heralds. In 1775 the College Surveyor drew attention to this problem, but to no avail. In February 1800, the College was asked by a Select Committee of the House of Commons to report to them the state of public records; again the heralds drew attention to the proximity of the Sugar House. Members of the committee inspected the College premises and reported to the House that the College must either be moved to a new building or secured against the risk of fire. Again nothing was done; in 1812 water seeped through the walls of the College <b>damaging</b> records. The <b>Surveyor</b> traced the leak back to a shed recently erected by Mr. Alderman Smith, owner of the Sugar House, who declared his readiness to do everything he could, but who actually did very little to rectify the situation. After years of negotiation the College, in 1820, bought the Sugar House from Smith for the sum of £1,500.|$|R
500|$|The tornado then tracked into Trousdale County {{and passed}} through rural areas to the {{northwest}} of Hartsville, weakening slightly to high-end EF2 strength. Frame homes were damaged or destroyed, vehicles were tossed and damaged, numerous trees were snapped and denuded, and mobile homes were obliterated with debris and insulation strewn long distances downwind. Ten homes were destroyed, and 23 homes had major damage along this segment of the path. As {{a result of the}} tornado, a major fire occurred as a natural gas plant was ripped apart by the tornado in the southwestern portion of the county. The area was evacuated and no one was injured at the plant. Two people were killed at a home along U.S. Route 231, and five other people were injured in the county. Crossing into Macon County, the tornado regained EF3 intensity as it struck the western and northern sections of Lafayette, resulting in widespread, major destruction in the area. Numerous homes and several churches were destroyed in Lafeyette, with several leveled to the ground. An auto sales business in town sustained heavy <b>damage</b> as well. <b>Surveyors</b> observed major <b>damage</b> to a large, expensive brick home that was built unanchored on a very weak, unreinforced cinder block foundation. The house shifted off the foundation during the tornado, causing walls to buckle and collapse. 170 homes were destroyed, and 9 homes had major damage in the Lafeyette area. 13 people were killed in and around town, and 44 others were injured. President George W. Bush toured the Macon County destruction on February 8 and promised relief to individuals. The logging industry in Macon County was hit hard, with about a million dollars worth of trees destroyed. Debris from Lafeyette was found as far north as Sano, Kentucky, in Adair County, approximately [...] to the northeast. Sixteen thousand TVA electricity customers in Macon and Trousdale Counties lost power, some of whom did not have their service restored for a week. Macon County schools were closed until February 19. In total, roughly 260 houses in the three Tennessee counties were destroyed, and damage amounts were estimated at $78million in Macon County alone.|$|R

After years of negotiation the College, in 1820, bought the Sugar House from Smith for the sum of £1,500. Great financial strains placed upon the College during these times were relieved when the extravagant Prince Regent (the future George IV), granted to the College an annual endowment by Royal Warrant on 29 February 1820. This generous endowment from the crown, the first since 1555, was applied towards the reparation and support of the College. Despite the successes of the purchase of the Sugar House and the royal endowment, the College still looked upon the possibility of moving its location to a more suitable and fashionable place. John Nash was at the same time laying out his plans for a new London, and, in 1822, the College, through the Deputy Earl Marshal, asked the government for a portion of land in the new districts on which to build a house to keep their records. A petition from the College was given to the Lords of the Treasury setting out the herald's reason for the move: [...] "that the local situation of the College is so widely detached from the proper scene of the official duties and occupations of Your Memorialists and from the residences of that class of persons by whom the records in their charge are chiefly and most frequently consulted." ...|$|R
