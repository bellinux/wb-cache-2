Players collect them throughout the game, primarily by opening chests, breaking pots and barrels, and searching in sacks and drawers.

5|$|In 2001, Martin {{was still}} {{optimistic that the}} fourth {{installment}} might be released {{in the last quarter}} of 2002. However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. On one hand, Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> happen for five years. After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book, which he called A Feast for Crows. The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap. The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands. These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions complicated the plot for Martin.|$|E
5|$|Writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and {{producer}} Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{of the show}} TGS with Tracy Jordan have decided to rig the TGS auditions—in which they are {{in search of a}} new cast member on the show—by planning to add bad actors so that their preferred choice, Jayden Michael Tyler (Nick Fondulis), gets hired by their boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin). TGS cast member Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) learns that the auditions are taking place and worries that her position on the show will be lessened with the arrival of a new actor. Although Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), the star of the show, reassures Jenna that the two <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to worry about, she remains uneasy. Later, Jenna discovers that Liz and Pete want Jayden to be cast, but she pleads with Liz to pull Jayden out of his audition. Jenna hates him for humiliating her after working together on a play, but Liz does not change her mind about Jayden. Jenna eventually figures out what Liz and Pete are scheming, so she and Tracy go out and find people (Angela Grovey and David Perlman) and bring them to the TGS auditions.|$|E
5|$|Rise of Mana was {{the brainchild}} of Square Enix {{producer}} Masaru Oyamada, who had {{made a name for himself}} within the company working in its mobile division on mobile ports of Final Fantasy Adventure and Secret of Mana. Speaking with series producer Koichi Ishii, Oyamada said that he could create an original mobile title that would be a legitimate entry in the series. Instead of a social or card-based game, which were the most prevalent genres in mobile gaming at the time, Oyamada wanted to create an action role-playing game that was accessible to a large number of casual gamers, something which would worry him throughout its production. The main staff were made up of Oyamada, director Masato Yagi, and art director Hiroyuki Suzuki. Hiroyuki had previously only worked on the Final Fantasy series. After the initial release of Rise of Mana, Yagi was responsible for the main scenario alongside Oyamada and post-launch content producer Naofumi Takuma. Oyamada also initially tried to bring Chaos Rings producer Takehiro Ando on board, but Ando would <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with the project. Development began in July 2012. The game was constructed using the Unity engine. In addition to staff from Square Enix, main development was done by Japanese developer Goshow, and its server security and technical assistance was handled by Fixer. The protagonists and some NPCs were designed by Japanese artist Taiki, while another artist Ryota Murayama handled NPC and monster designs. The game's key art was created by in-house designer Dairaku Masahiko: he was brought in after regular Mana key art illustrator Hiroo Isono died in 2013. Masahiko was asked by Oyamada to create something similar to Isono's previous artwork in creating a representation of pointillism. The game's title was indicative of the title's nature as a new entry in the Mana series; other than a small card-battle mobile game in 2013, Circle of Mana, Rise was the first Mana title since Heroes of Mana in 2007.|$|E

5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E
