50|$|In 2016, {{following}} {{military exercises}} by Chechen paratroopers on Barneo, Norway enacted a <b>flight</b> <b>embargo,</b> which it later lifted. As a result, the 2017 event {{was expected to}} take place with a base in Russia. However in March 2017 an expedition tour operator was taking bookings for 2017 and 2018 with flights operating out of Longyearbyen.|$|E
50|$|Bosphorus Airways began {{services}} in April 1992 with two Boeing 737-3H9 for charter flights {{to and from}} Turkey. In May 1993 one of the B737 was temporarily impounded for violations of the <b>flight</b> <b>embargo</b> into Serbia. The company planned for the summer season flights with larger McDonnell Douglas DC-10 to start. However, these ideas were dashed, since utilization and demand due {{to the effects of}} the Second Gulf War, declined rapidly. The financial situation for the airline worsened {{and by the end of}} 1993 the airline was shut down.|$|E

These were armed flights carrying Rockeye cluster bombs, Harpoon anti-ship missiles and the first highly successful deployment of the Remote Imaging Transmission System. The missions were flown in support of UN operations to enforce the cease-fire between warring factions of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia, and to prevent outside factions from providing resupply by sea.|$|R

Secondly, main problems behind the competiveness of sector were revealed and SWOT analysis was conducted. Finally recommendations were developed to improve the competiveness of the industry sector in TRNC. As a summary, the crucial problems of industry sector can be categorised into unfavorable investment climate and obstacles behind the competiveness of private sector such as absence of direct <b>flight</b> and trade <b>embargoes.</b> So, financial, structural and institutional measures towards the whole economy and industry sector {{should be taken to}} mitigate these crucial problems and improve competiveness...|$|R
5000|$|Due to the {{blockade}} of Qatar Airways from the airspace of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt, Oman Air {{has taken up}} a significant role transporting travelers from and to Doha, mostly through Iranian airspace, while still allowing Qatar passport holders to book <b>flights.</b> The travel <b>embargo</b> has {{had a significant impact}} on foreign nationals living and working in Qatar, with about 100,000 Egyptians and citizens from other countries stranded there, unable to book direct flights or obtain travel documents for their return. Per request from Qatar, {{the blockade}} is currently under review by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a UN-agency seeking [...] "consensus-based solutions" [...] for the resolution of the crisis.|$|R
50|$|January-October 1993: VP-93 {{deployed}} to NAS Sigonella, Sicily, and Naval Station Rota, Spain, {{in support of}} Adriatic Sea <b>embargo</b> <b>flights</b> for Operation Maritime Guard against the former Republic of Yugoslavia. These were armed flights carrying Harpoon antiship missiles. The missions were flown in support of UN operations to enforce the cease-fire between warring factions of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia, and to prevent outside factions from providing resupply by sea. The squadron also supplied single aircrews and aircraft over the period of May and June 1993 for Operation Sharp Guard. Three aircrews returned to NAS Sigonella again in October for continued Sharp Guard support. This detachment was hastily repositioned within 24 hours to NAS Key West, Florida, to provide support for operations Uphold Democracy and Able Mariner, the UN sanctioned embargo of Haiti.|$|R
50|$|On 2 January 1993 VP-94 was {{assigned}} to CTF 67.1 at NAS Sigonella, Sicily, and CTF 67.2 at Naval Base Rota, Spain, in support of Adriatic Sea <b>embargo</b> <b>flights</b> for Operation Maritime Guard against the former Republic of Yugoslavia. These were armed flights carrying Harpoon antiship missiles. The missions were flown in support of UN operations to enforce the cease-fire betweenwarring factions of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia and to prevent outside factions from providing re-supply by sea. From June-July 1993 the squadron supplied detachments for Operation Sharp Guard in support of UN operations. This concept of separate detachment deployments, rather than entire unit deployments, became known as flexible detachment operations, or Det Ops. This form of deployment provided {{the maximum amount of}} interoperability between USN and USNR forward deployed forces, while supporting real operations and not just training flights for the Reserves. Reserve Det Ops also served as a much-needed supplement to the active-duty patrol squadrons in an era of post-Cold War cutbacks.|$|R
