5|$|Now {{a prince}} (pangeran), Amir {{was given the}} title Tengku Pangeran Indra Putera. He lived with Kamiliah in their own home. By all accounts, she was a devout and loving wife, and in 1939 the couple had their only child, a {{daughter}} named Tengku Tahura. According to Dini, Amir professed to Kamiliah that he could never love her as he had Sundari and that he felt obligated to marry <b>her,</b> <b>something</b> which Kamiliah reportedly accepted. The poet retained an album with his Javanese sweetheart's photographs at home and would often isolate himself from his family, lost in thought. As a prince of Langkat, Amir became a court official, handling administrative and legal matters, and at times judging criminal cases. He once represented the sultanate at the funeral of PakubuwonoX in Java– Amir's last trip to the island.|$|E

500|$|A film {{adaptation}} of Nancy Drew {{was released on}} June 15, 2007 by Warner Bros. Pictures, with Emma Roberts as Nancy Drew, Max Thieriot as Ned Nickerson and Tate Donovan as Carson Drew. Andrew Fleming directed the film, while Jerry Weintraub produced. As with the earlier Drew films, reactions were mixed. Some see the film as updated version of the basic character: [...] "although it has been glammed up for the lucrative tween demographic, the movie retains {{the best parts of}} the books, including, of course, their intelligent main character." [...] Others find the movie [...] "jolting" [...] because Nancy's [...] "new classmates prefer shopping to sleuthing, and Nancy's plaid skirt, penny loafers, and magnifying glass make <b>her</b> <b>something</b> of a dork, not the town hero she was in the Midwest." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rap-Up in March 2010, Minaj revealed the title to the song, and Garrett later hinted around details around his single with Minaj, stating, [...] "I just did Nicki’s first single featuring me. It’s gonna be a fucking bomb. It’s very, very explosive! It’s a club banger. It’s a lot broader than what people would expect her to come with. The record puts her in the game {{in a way that}} says she should’ve been here a long time ago. She has a real way of how she wants to do this. It’s just gonna be a surprise when it comes. She just wants to make it as huge as possible." [...] Additionally, co-producer Alex da Kid said, [...] "I started on the train and finished in the studio. I knew it was special from the start. It wasn't like I was aiming for Nicki with this track; I had a idea I thought was crazy. Nicki heard it and the rest was history." [...] In {{an interview}} with MTV News, Minaj stated when she first heard the song she felt she was in Africa {{and fell in love with}} the drum beats, and commented, [...] "It's a very rare. ... You're not gonna get the song the first time you hear it. After the second or third time, you're gonna be like, 'Whoa, what is this?' It sounds nothing like anything that's out right now." [...] She also called the song [...] "next-level futuristic", and said that she chose Garrett for the song in that he would be the best to [...] "illustrate Nicki Minaj", as he got her and her personality". In an interview on the set of the video shoot for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said, [...] "I'm excited for people to hear me ... doing more than one verse. It's really creative. I wanted to be theatrical, but I am very serous about what I do." [...] Also on the set of the video, Garrett said, [...] "We wanted to give <b>her</b> <b>something</b> that was global," [...] he continued. [...] "We wanted to give <b>her</b> <b>something</b> that was urban; we wanted to give <b>her</b> <b>something</b> that was mainstream pop, you know what I mean, that the world could get a chance to see her out on this pedestal. And of course, you know, I had to come along with her, because I've got an album dropping soon." [...] The song made its debut March 29, 2010 on WQHT. The song leaked onto the Internet on March 30, 2010, the day before its music video premiere on 106 & Park. The single's art cover was revealed on April 1, 2010, featuring a still of Minaj in the music video as a ninja and comic book font designs. Alex da Kid said that a lot of artists wanted the beat such as Jamie Foxx and Young Jeezy but he gave it to Nicki because it fit her [...] "quirky, left-field vibe." ...|$|E

500|$|Gaga further {{elaborated}} on {{the inspiration}} behind the song as walking towards the light force {{in her life}} and peering towards the devil in the back, while clutching onto {{the source of the}} light. [...] "I sing about what a holy fool I am, and that although moments in my life are so cruel and relationships can be so cruel I’m still in love with Judas. I still go back again to those evil things," [...] she said. During her interview with Google, Gaga added to the song's meaning as honoring one's inner darkness in order to bring themselves into the light. One has to learn to forgive themselves in order to move on with their life. With Popjustice she clarified that {{she has a lot of}} things that have haunted her from her past, including her choices, men, drug abuse, being afraid to go back to New York, confronting old romances. Hence [...] "Judas" [...] represented something that was not good for <b>her,</b> <b>something</b> she could not escape. Gaga said: [...] "I keep going back and forth between the darkness and the light in order to understand who I am." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{continues}} the storyline of Tom and Lynette's separation. Huffman enjoyed her character's storyline, stating: [...] "I'm {{sure there are}} things that they knew the viewers want, which is for Tom and Lynette to get back together. But I do like that it's kind of {{up in the air and}} maybe they won't." [...] Doug Savant commented, [...] "For many years on this show, we knew that Tom and Lynette were the grounding force on the street. They were the couple that most resembled most couples in America. It just got to a point after so many years when [...] really wanted to explore the things that made this relationship work by first pulling it apart." [...] Both actors expressed their desire for the couple to reunite by the series' end. Charles Mesure made his debut as new neighbor Ben Faulkner, a self-made contractor and Renee's new love interest. According to Vanessa Williams, [...] "She’s working hard to make it happen and it’s not happening easily for her. And she’s not used to that and that’s where the comedy ensues and it gives <b>her</b> <b>something</b> to pursue." ...|$|E

500|$|Abi's earlier storylines {{consist of}} her parents {{fighting}} for custody of her and her siblings, being injured in a collision with Deano Wicks' (Di Angelo) car and helping her friend Ben (Jones) with his abuse from stepmother Stella Crawford (Thompson) In February 2011, Abi {{was involved in a}} car accident with Max and would suffer severe injuries after their car collides with a lorry on the way to Tanya's wedding to her new partner Greg (Booth). The crash scenes were filmed on 6 March 2011 and aired on 14 April 2011. After these minor storylines, Joyner said that Fitzgerald should be involved in more complex storylines in 2012. She said, [...] "I think it's going to be an exciting year for Lorna. She's been a natural on the show ever since she was younger, and I think she's one of our best actresses. What's lovely about this year is that she'll be doing her GCSEs, and then once that's out of the way, she can get something that's a bit heavier and a bit bigger. She'll be old enough to work longer hours, so I think they'd be mad if they didn't give <b>her</b> <b>something</b> to sink her teeth into at some point this year".|$|E
500|$|Other storylines {{received}} a more mixed response. Canning disliked the focus placed on Sam and his thin, [...] "loveable dope" [...] characterization. He {{found that the}} love-triangle plot made little sense, and as such was hard to invest in. In contrast, Poniewozik called Sam's Bieber subplot the episode's strongest element, and deemed it fun if inessential. He praised Glee for capturing the [...] "disposable fun" [...] of Bieber's music, [...] "without either sneering at it or making it more than it is", and called it better in this respect than [...] "The Power of Madonna". Lauren received several positive reviews. While VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck [...] "a lot less assured" [...] than in [...] "Silly Love Songs", Mullins and Gonzalez praised their [...] "endearing" [...] dynamic. Reiter felt that in [...] "Comeback", while new characters like Sam and Lauren [...] "managed to shine", established favorites fared less well: [...] "Finn continues to be dismayingly drained of all that once made him so adorable, and Rachel, too, has been deprived of the depth and sex appeal she so carefully developed over time." [...] Several critics raised similar criticism of Rachel—Gonzalez found her need for Brittany's help [...] "too much of a regression", and disliked her return to [...] "old, desperate habits" [...] after several episodes of personal growth. Canning felt that the storyline was forced, and Poniewozik observed that the episode [...] "seemed to be trying less to advance her character [...] simply to give <b>her</b> <b>something</b> to do." [...] VanDerWerff wrote that Rachel appeared to have five different subplots, none of which came together cohesively, and that it reflected the awkward construction of the episode.|$|E
500|$|Rainie's {{relationship}} with Phil Mitchell (McFadden) was first explored during her stint in 2010. Rainie and Phil {{were to be}} involved in a storyline involving the taking of crack cocaine. Discussing her return in 2010, she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together. Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya's ex-husband Max, and moving in with Phil that, [...] "it gets quite dark and dirty, really. Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other. He offers <b>her</b> <b>something</b> that she wants, and that is a place to be, while she has something that he wants, and that's drugs—so it's a match at that time." [...] Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic. She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, [...] "If {{there are people who have}} a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that we worked with, DrugScope, gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions. I think it can be hugely helpful when a show as popular as EastEnders does something like this." [...] She also stated that if EastEnders [...] "has saved one life by putting this story out it's been worth it. The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life. Some of it is going to be light entertainment, some isn't." ...|$|E

[...] Rivers also compared herself to Allen, stating: [...] "He was a writer, which I basically was ... and talking about things that affected our generation that nobody else talked about."

2500|$|They {{separated}} on 5 August 1972. It is {{not clear}} what made them part their ways. On being asked the reason for their parting, O P Nayyar once said, [...] "I know astrology very well.
