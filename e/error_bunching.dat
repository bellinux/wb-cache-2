40|$|Diffraction {{effects in}} the Coherent Transition Radiation (CTR) bunch length {{diagnostics}} are considered for the A 0 Photoinjector and the New Muon Laboratory (NML) injection module. The effects can cause a noticeable distortion of the measured CTR spectra depending on the experimental setup and the bunch parameters and resulting in <b>errors</b> of the <b>bunch</b> length measurements. Presented calculations show possible systematic <b>errors</b> in the <b>bunch</b> length in measurements based on the CTR spectra at A 0 Photo injector and the NML injection module...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} to be solved in the compressor system of CTF 3 [1] is to preserve the beam quality. In particular, energy losses and the energy spread are of a great concern for the CTF 3 combiner ring design. The energy losses give rise to relative phase <b>errors</b> between <b>bunches</b> through non-perfect ring isochronicity, which result in deterioration of the timing both betwee...|$|R

The study {{is based on}} a unified beam dynamic model of synchrotron oscillation under phase and radial feedbacks.

40|$|Accurately {{as well as}} {{efficiently}} calculating the early exercise boundary {{is the key to}} the highly nonlinear problem of pricing American options. Many analytical approximations have been proposed in the past, aiming at improving the computational efficiency and the easiness of using the formula, while maintaining a reasonable numerical accuracy at the same time. In this paper, we shall present an approximation formula based on Bunch and Johnson's work [6]. After clearly pointing out some <b>errors</b> in <b>Bunch</b> and Johnson's paper [6], we will propose an improved approximation formula that can significantly enhance the computational accuracy, particularly for options of long lifetime. Optimal exercise boundary, American put options, analytical approximations...|$|R
50|$|To exclude {{possible}} statistical <b>errors,</b> CERN produced <b>bunched</b> proton beams between October and November 2011. The proton extractions {{were split}} into short bunches of 3 ns at intervals of 524 ns, {{so that every}} neutrino event could be directly connected to a proton bunch. The measurement of twenty neutrino events again gave an early arrival of about 62 ns, {{in agreement with the}} previous result. They updated their analysis and increased the significance up to 6,2σ.|$|R

We {{can imagine that}} having a {{systematic}} part vjk that {{is a function of}} the characteristics of an object and person j, plus a random part ejk, which represents tastes, observational <b>errors</b> and a <b>bunch</b> of other things (it gets murky here). (An object such as a vehicle does not have utility, it is characteristics of a vehicle that have utility.) The introduction of e lets us do some aggregation.

40|$|Theoretical {{analysis}} of e-cloud {{instability in the}} Fermilab Recycler is represented in the paper. The e-cloud in strong magnetic field is treated {{as a set of}} immovable snakes each being initiated by some proton bunch. It is shown that the instability arises because of injection <b>errors</b> of the <b>bunches</b> which increase in time and from bunch to bunch along the batch being amplified by the e-cloud electric field. The particular attention is given to nonlinear additions to the cloud field. It is shown that the nonlinearity is the main factor which restricts growth of the bunch amplitude. Possible role of the field free parts of the Recycler id discussed as well. Results of calculations are compared with experimental data demonstrating good correlation...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{acceptable}} luminosity for ILC crossing angles greater than 2 mrad, RF deflection cavities must be used to rotate electron and position bunches {{leading up to the}} IP. A bunch that passes through a deflection cavity at a phase where the deflection averages to zero, receives a crab kick leading to a finite rotation at the IP. For a beam energy of 500 GeV and a crossing angle of 20 mrad the required crab kick is about 11. 4 MV at 1. 3 GHz and 3. 8 MV at 3. 9 GHz. Cavities are needed on both beams and are likely to be positioned about 12 m before the IP. Any RF phase <b>error</b> between the <b>bunch</b> and the cavity leads to a deflection of the bunch in addition to a rotation of the bunch. Any differential phase error between the cavities leads to differing deflections and consequential loss in luminosity. An updated analysis of system requirements and phase tolerances with respect to original calculations [1] is given. Issues on cavity and frequency choice are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In high-brightness LINear ACcelerators (LINACs), {{electron}} bunch length can {{be measured}} indirectly by a radio frequency deflector (RFD). In this paper, the accuracy loss arising from non-negligible correlations between particle longitudinal positions and the transverse plane (in particular the vertical one) at RFD entrance is analytically assessed. Theoretical predictions are compared with simulation results, obtained by means of ELEctron Generation ANd Tracking (ELEGANT) code, in the case study of the gamma beam system (GBS) at the extreme light infrastructure—nuclear physics (ELI-NP). In particular, the relative <b>error</b> affecting the <b>bunch</b> length measurement, for bunches characterized by both energy chirp and fixed correlation coefficients between longitudinal particle positions and the vertical plane, is reported. Moreover, the relative error versus the correlation coefficients is shown for fixed RFD phase 0 rad and rad. The relationship between relative error and correlations factors can help the decision of using the bunch length measurement technique {{with one or two}} vertical spot size measurements in order to cancel the correlations contribution. In the case of the GBS electron LINAC, the misalignment of one of the quadrupoles before the RFD between − 2 mm and 2 mm leads to a relative error less than 5...|$|R
40|$|Value at Risk {{and similar}} {{measures}} of financial risk exposure require predicting {{the tail of}} an asset returns distribution. Assuming a specific form, such as the normal, for the distribution, the standard deviation (and possibly other parameters) are estimated from recent historical data and the tail cutoff value is computed. But this standard procedure ignores estimation error, which we find to be substantial even {{under the best of}} conditions. In practice, a "tail event" may represent a truly rare occurrence, or it may simply be a not-so-rare occurrence {{at a time when the}} predicted volatility underestimates the true volatility, due to sampling error. This problem gets worse the further in the tail one is trying to predict. Using a simulation of 10, 000 years of daily returns, we first examine estimation risk when volatility is an unknown constant parameter. We then consider the more realistic, but more problematical, case of volatility that drifts stochastically over time. This substantially increases estimation error, although strong mean reversion in the variance tends to dampen the effect. Non-normal fat-tailed return shocks makes overall risk assessment much worse, especially in the extreme tails, but estimation error per se does not add much beyond the effect of tail fatness. Using an exponentially weighted moving average to downweight older data hurts accuracy if volatility is constant or only slowly changing. But with more volatile variance, an optimal decay rate emerges, with better performance for the most extreme tails being achieved using a relatively greater rate of downweighting. We first simulate non-overlapping independent samples, but in practical risk management, risk exposure is estimated day by day on a rolling basis. This produces strong autocorrelation in the estimation <b>errors,</b> and <b>bunching</b> of apparently extreme events. We find that with stochastic volatility, estimation error can increase the probabilities of multi-day events, like three 1 % tail events in a row, by several orders of magnitude. Finally, we report empirical results using 40 years of daily S&P 500 returns which confirm that the issues we have examined in simulations are also present in the real world. ...|$|R
40|$|Here we will derive {{the general}} theory of the beam-breakup {{instability}} in recirculating linear accelerators, in which the bunches {{do not have to be}} at the same RF phase during each recirculation turn. This is important for the description of energy recovery linacs (ERLs) where bunches are recirculated at a decelerating phase of the RF wave and for other recirculator arrangements where different RF phases are of an advantage. Furthermore it can be used for the analysis of phase <b>errors</b> of recirculated <b>bunches.</b> It is shown how the threshold current for a given linac can be computed and a remarkable agreement with tracking data is demonstrated. The general formulas are then analyzed for several analytically solvable cases, which show: (a) Why different higher order modes (HOM) in one cavity do not couple so that the most dangerous modes can be considered individually. (b) How different HOM frequencies have to be in order to consider them separately. (c) That no optics can cause the HOMs of two cavities to cancel. (d) How an optics can avoid the addition of the instabilities of two cavities. (e) How a HOM in a multiple-turn recirculator interferes with itself. Furthermore, a simple method to compute the orbit deviations produced by cavity misalignments has also been introduced. It is shown that the BBU instability always occurs before the orbit excursion becomes very large. Comment: 12 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Here we will derive {{the general}} theory of the beam-breakup (BBU) {{instability}} in recirculating linear accelerators with coupled beam optics and with polarized higher-order dipole modes. The bunches {{do not have to be}} at the same radio-frequency phase during each recirculation turn. This is important for the description of energy recovery linacs (ERLs) where beam currents become very large and coupled optics are used on purpose to increase the threshold current. This theory can be used for the analysis of phase <b>errors</b> of recirculated <b>bunches,</b> and of <b>errors</b> in the optical coupling arrangement. It is shown how the threshold current for a given linac can be computed and a remarkable agreement with tracking data is demonstrated. General formulas are then analyzed for several analytically solvable problems: (a) Why can different higher order modes (HOM) in one cavity couple and why can they then not be considered individually, even when their frequencies are separated by much more than the resonance widths of the HOMs? For the Cornell ERL as an example, it is noted that optimum advantage is taken of coupled optics when the cavities are designed with an x-y HOM frequency splitting of above 50  MHz. The simulated threshold current is then far above the design current of this accelerator. To justify that the simulation can represent an actual accelerator, we simulate cavities with 1 to 8 modes and show that using a limited number of modes is reasonable. (b) How does the x-y coupling in the particle optics determine when modes can be considered separately? (c) How much of an increase in threshold current can be obtained by coupled optics and why does the threshold current for polarized modes diminish roughly with the square root of the HOMs’ quality factors. Because of this square root scaling, polarized modes with coupled optics increase the threshold current more effectively for cavities that have rather large HOM quality factors, e. g. those without very elaborate HOM absorbers. (d) How does multiple-turn recirculation interfere with the threshold improvements obtained with a coupled optics? Furthermore, the orbit deviations produced by cavity misalignments are also generalized to coupled optics. It is shown that the BBU instability always occurs before the orbit excursion becomes very large...|$|R
