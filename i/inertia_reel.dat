50|$|The 172R's maximum {{takeoff weight}} is 2450 lb. This model year {{introduced}} many improvements, {{including a new}} interior with soundproofing, an all new multi-level ventilation system, a standard four point intercom, contoured, energy absorbing, 26g front seats with vertical and reclining adjustments and <b>inertia</b> <b>reel</b> harnesses.|$|E
5000|$|A {{centrifugal}} clutch {{is used in}} small engine-powered devices such as chain saws, go-karts and model helicopters. It allows the engine to start and idle without driving the device but automatically and smoothly engages the drive as the engine speed rises. Inertial drum brake ascenders used in rock climbing and the <b>inertia</b> <b>reels</b> used in many automobile seat belts operate on the same principle.|$|R

5000|$|Early IBM tape drives, {{such as the}} IBM 727 and IBM 729, were {{mechanically}} sophisticated floor-standing drives {{that used}} vacuum columns to buffer long u-shaped loops of tape. Between active control of powerful reel motors and vacuum control of these u-shaped tape loops, fast start and stop of the tape at the tape-to-head interface could be achieved: 1.5 ms from stopped tape to full speed of 112.5 in/s m/s. The fast acceleration is possible because the tape mass in the vacuum columns is small; the length of tape buffered in the columns provides time to spin the high <b>inertia</b> <b>reels.</b> When active, the two tape reels thus fed tape into or pulled tape out of the vacuum columns, intermittently spinning in rapid, unsynchronized bursts resulting in visually striking action. Stock shots of such vacuum-column tape drives in motion were widely used to represent [...] "the computer" [...] in movies and television.|$|R
5000|$|... 1979 - Revisions to all models: driver's side rear {{fog light}} and rear seat belts. The R20 TS got a new cooling fan, <b>inertia</b> <b>reel</b> rear seat belts, a new {{windscreen}} wiper switch, and {{the choice of a}} 5-speed gearbox. The R30 TS got a more powerful [...] engine, and small pocket in the drivers sun visor.|$|E
50|$|In June 1963, it {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} seat belt that allowed the belt to move but locked in rapid deceleration, as all belts are now today, known as <b>inertia</b> <b>reel,</b> and which it called an 'automatic belt'. In the mid-1960s, Britax was based on Chertsey Road in Byfleet. In June 1966, the parent company, Excelsior Motor, bought Notek, a car light manufacturer.|$|E

5000|$|Aside from a longer, 5 year/50,000 mile warranty, Eldorado {{received}} {{very few}} changes for 1987. A price drop, to $23,740, {{did not raise}} sales any, as only 17,775 were made this year (21,342 for 1986). The standard suspension, with new taller 75 series (previously 70) tires and hydro-elastic engine mounts, was slightly retuned for a softer ride, while the optional ($155) Touring Suspension, with deflected-disc strut valves and 15" [...] alloy wheels, remained for those desiring a firmer ride. As part of a federal requirement to discourage [...] "chop-shop" [...] thieves, major body panels were etched with the VIN. Also new, a combination cashmere cloth with leather upholstery, and locking <b>inertia</b> seat belt <b>reels</b> for rear seat passengers, which allowed for child-seat installation in the outboard seating positions in back. The formal cabriolet roof was added this year. Available for $495 on the base Eldorado, it featured a padded covering over the rear half of the roof, and turned the rear side glass into smaller opera windows. One of Eldorado's most expensive singluar options was the Motorola cellular telephone mounted inside the locking center arm rest. Priced at $2,850, it had been reworked this year for easier operation, and featured a hidden microphone mounted between the sun visors for hands-free operation. Additionally, the telephone featured a clever radio mute control: activated when the telephone and radio were in use at the same time, it automatically decreased the rear speaker's audio volume, and over-rode the front music speakers {{to be used for}} the hands-free telephone. On an interesting note, the square marker lamp, located on the bumper extension molding just behind the rear wheel well on 1986 and '87 Eldorado models, would suddenly re-appear on the 1990 & '91 Seville (base models only) and Eldorado Touring Coupé.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Executive" [...] was an {{upmarket}} {{version and}} had the highest specification offered by Ford to UK customers in the 1960s. Automatic transmission (the Zodiac's four-speed manual box with overdrive being also available as a 'no cost' option) along with power steering and a sunroof were standard equipment. Other standard features included; fully reclining front seats, Walnut fascia, full instrumentation, carpeting throughout, reversing lights, fog lamps, front <b>inertia</b> <b>reel</b> safety belts, and a radio. The Executive was distinguishable from other models by exterior trim and name badges {{on the front and}} rear.|$|E
5000|$|The car {{was tested}} again by Motor {{magazine}} five years later. The article {{is critical of}} the car's styling, calling it [...] "square cut" [...] and [...] "hardly avant garde", but then relents and opts for [...] "mature rather than dated" [...] as its final comment. The ride is reported to improve as loading and speed increase. Of some concern to the testers was the driver's difficulty in reaching the handbrake when wearing a fixed seat-belt - <b>inertia</b> <b>reel</b> type belts would not have this problem. Alternative cars were listed as the Citroen Safari and Volvo 145. The car is described as having been used by one reader to transport the driver and 12 children.|$|E
50|$|In August 1974 the 17TS (R1317 with 1605 cc) {{finally made}} it to Australia, along with the European 1974 model year 15TS and 17TL with the later type dashboard. In early 1975 the 17TS was {{replaced}} by the 17 Gordini. Available later were the 15TS and 17TL with Gordini front suspension, <b>inertia</b> <b>reel</b> seat belts, tinted windows, tombstone seats and evaporative emission control as required by ADR. This was identified by the carbon canister under the bonnet, and hinged fuel filler door in the LBR quarter panel. In 1976 a final shipment of 1975 model year 17s was made and stock piled prior to the introduction of ADR 27A emission controls, these vehicles, again due to their high price, sold slowly through until 1978.|$|E
5000|$|Over its {{seven years}} in production, the 411 showed a number of changes. The 1971 Series 2 added {{self-levelling}} suspension and a metric odometer, while the Series 3 from a year later had a lower compression ratio and completely revised styling. This edition was the first Bristol to possess the four-headlamp layout that was oddly anticipated {{by some of the}} company's earliest models, and to power this a bigger alternator was used. For the Series 4 of 1974, the compression ratio was reduced dramatically (from 9.5:1 to 8.2:1) but this was compensated by using a larger version of the B series engine with a capacity of [...] The Series 5 made from 1975 to 1976 had the original Bristol badge restored and was the first Bristol to feature <b>inertia</b> <b>reel</b> seat belts.|$|E
50|$|The first Ford Special, was the Capri Vista Orange Special.The Capri Special was {{launched}} in November 1971 and {{was based on the}} 1600 GT, and 2000 GT models. It was only available in vista orange and was optional dealer fitted with a Ford Rally Sport boot mounted spoiler and rear window slats - a direct link to the Mustang. The Special also had some additional standard extras such as a push-button radio, fabric seat upholstery, <b>inertia</b> <b>reel</b> seat belts, heated rear screen and black vinyl roof. There were only 1200 Vista Orange Capri Specials made.One of the last limited editions of the original Mk I, was a version that came in either metallic green or black with red interior and featured some additional extras, such as cloth inserts in the seats, hazard lights, map reading light, opening rear windows, vinyl roof {{and for the first time}} a bonnet bulge was fitted to the sub-3.0-litre models. This special edition was only available with a 1.6 or 2.0 engines and had the full title of GTXLR Special.|$|E
5000|$|Using {{the same}} 1,600 cc engine and a four or {{five-speed}} manual gearbox from the Corcel, {{came with the}} differential of Corcel 1:4 to better use to advantage {{the force of the}} engine. It also had the front suspension of the Corcel, with stiffer springs and shock absorbers to support bigger loads. Thus, the Pampas was perfect for the transport of loads up to 620 kg. With regard to the Corcel, the wheelbase was also increased. The fuel tank in the Pampas was soon moved to behind the cabin, and its doors were made smaller - identical to the ones of the four door Ford Del Rey. With the 1600 cc engine, the Pampas developed , perfect for the transport of the most varied loads and [...] with the model which ran on alcohol. The Pampas pickup had very good general performance. Its maximum speed was of 100 mi/h km/h and its fuel tank had a 76-litre capacity. The Pampa’s options included a digital clock, air-conditioning, adjustable head restraints, radio and <b>inertia</b> <b>reel</b> seat belts. Many of these items were found in the luxurious Del Rey.|$|E
50|$|Mercedes {{introduced}} a coupé {{variant of the}} W114 in 1969, featuring a longer boot hood and available with either a 2.5 or 2.8 litre six-cylinder engine. While a classic and understated design these generally cost less than the W113-based 280 SL model that ran through 1971, and its successor, the 3.5 or 4.5 litre V8 Mercedes SL R107/C107 (1971-1989) roadster and coupé. While a 'hard-top' unlike the fully convertible SL, the pillarless design allowed all the windows to be lowered completely for open air motoring. Only 67,048 coupés were manufactured from 1969 to 1976 (vs. 1.852,008 saloons). Of these 24,669 were 280C and 280CE (top of the range), and 42,379 were the lesser 250C and 250CE (A Mercedes-Benz 220D pickup on the W115 chassis was produced briefly in Argentina in the 1970s.)The W114 received a facelift in 1973 - with a lower bonnet-line, lower and broader grill, a single front bumper to replace the double bumpers, lower placement of the headlamps, A-pillar treatment for keeping the side windows clear, removal of the quarter-windows in the front doors, ribbed tail lights to minimize occlusion of the tail lights with road dirt, and larger side mirrors. The interior received <b>inertia</b> <b>reel</b> belts and a new padded steering wheel with a four-hole design.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced {{early in}} June 1966, {{with the same}} engine and {{mechanical}} components as the Cresta PC, the Viscount was the super de-luxe version of it. It was supplied as standard with power steering, electric windows, reclining seats, a vinyl roof, walnut dashboard, <b>inertia</b> <b>reel</b> seat belts front and back, and even a heated rear window. Areas of the grille and headlamp surrounds were blacked out to give a classier look and the tail-lights had a chrome overlay. The dark green, blue or maroon paintwork featured simulated, hand painted coachlines, along each flank, to give the car a coachpainted appearance. The outer pair of the quad, five inch, sealed beam headlamps were twin filament, giving the car four main beams. The Viscount also came with wider tyres than the Cresta (7.00-14in rather than 5.90-14in). [...] Some PC 3.3 had twin tail-pipes as this was a performance option of the time. The standard transmission option was GM's Powerglide 2-speed automatic system, but a four speed manual gearbox was available, initially on the UK market at a saving of £85: [...] elsewhere the manual gear box was a no-cost option. In {{the third quarter of}} 1970 the two-speed Powerglide automatic was replaced with a GM 3-speed automatic transmission.|$|E
50|$|Seatbelts {{restrain}} the passengers so they don't {{fly through the}} windshield, and are in the correct position for the airbag and also spread the loading of impact on the body. Seat belts also absorb passenger inertial energy by being designed to stretch during an impact, again to reduce the speed differential between the passenger's body and their vehicle interior. In short: a passenger whose body is decelerated more slowly due to the crumple zone (and other devices) over a longer time survives much more often than a passenger whose body indirectly impacts a hard, undamaged metal car body which {{has come to a}} halt nearly instantaneously. It is like the difference between slamming someone into a wall headfirst (fracturing their skull) and shoulder-first (bruising their flesh slightly) is that the arm, being softer, has tens of times longer to slow its speed, yielding a little at a time, than the hard skull, which isn't in contact with the wall until it has to deal with extremely high pressures. The stretching of seatbelts while restraining occupants during an impact, means {{that it is necessary to}} replace them if a vehicle is repaired and put back on the road after a collision. They should also be replaced if their condition has deteriorated e.g. through fraying or mechanical or belt mounting faults. In New Zealand it is officially mandatory to replace worn <b>inertia</b> <b>reel</b> type seatbelts only with 'webbing grabber' type belts that have less play and are more effective on older cars. Newer cars have electronically fired pre-tension seatbelts that are timed to work with the airbag firing. Buying used seatbelts is not a good idea even in countries where it is legal to do so, because they may have already been stretched in an impact event and may not protect their new users as they should.|$|E
40|$|A new NASA Ames {{concept for}} an {{aircraft}} passenger seat {{has been under}} research and development since 1968. It includes many human-factor features that will provide protection to the passenger from vibration, jostle, and high impact. It is comfortable and safer {{than any of the}} seats presently in use. An in-depth design, fabrication, and impact analysis was conducted in order to design a seat that will maximize passenger protection in high g impacts (20 g horizontal -Gx, 36 g vertical +Gz, 16 g lateral Gy). The method for absorbing impact energy was accomplished with a combination of stretching stainless steel cables, thread breaking of stitches, hydraulic mechanism and the special Temper Form cushions. The restraint system for the seat consisted of a lap belt and shoulder harness <b>inertia</b> <b>reel</b> combination...|$|E
