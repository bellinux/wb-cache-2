5|$|Bodyline {{continued}} to be bowled occasionally in the 1933 English season—most notably by Nottinghamshire, who had Carr, Voce and Larwood in their team.

Ken Farnes, the Cambridge University fast bowler, also bowled it in the University Match, <b>hitting</b> <b>a</b> few Oxford batsmen.|$|E
5|$|Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs {{needed in}} 257 minutes. After {{receiving}} another rapturous welcome from the Headingley spectators {{in his last}} innings at the ground, the Australian captain signalled his intentions by <b>hitting</b> <b>a</b> boundary from Compton and another off the first ball he faced from Laker, cover driving against the spin. Bradman reached 12 in six minutes.|$|E

50|$|For Team Liffey, Matt <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> perfect {{drive and}} Andy <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> stellar long iron shot to 7 feet, and Mark made the eagle putt. Then it was Team Straffan's turn. Joe also <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> perfect drive, and Julien <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> decent {{approach}} to 30 feet. Nina's eagle putt missed short right, so Team Straffan makes a birdie but they lose the challenge, and Team Liffey has a 1-0 lead.|$|R

5|$|Through {{the first}} three innings of the fifth game, both {{pitchers}} held the opposing team to no runs and {{a limited number of}} hits. In the bottom of the fourth inning, the Cardinals cracked through Pennock's tough pitching. Jim Bottomley began by <b>hitting</b> <b>a</b> one-out double past left fielder Babe Ruth. Les Bell followed with a single to right field, scoring Bottomley. Chick Hafey then hit a fly ball caught in foul territory by Ruth, and Bell was called out while attempting to steal second base. In the top of the sixth inning, Pennock hit a line drive double into left field past Hafey. Cardinals' catcher Bob O'Farrell threw to Tommy Thevenow in hopes of picking off Pennock, who was standing a considerable distance away from second base. Thevenow made an error with his tag on Pennock, and Pennock was safe at second base. Earle Combs, the Yankees leadoff hitter, followed by drawing a walk. With runners at first and second base, Koenig hit a single to left fielder Hafey. Pennock scored on the play, and Combs moved to second base. Ruth then struck out, and Bob Meusel followed by <b>hitting</b> <b>a</b> sacrifice fly to right fielder Billy Southworth, on which Combs promptly advanced to third base. Lou Gehrig drew a walk to load the bases for Tony Lazzeri, who ended the inning by <b>hitting</b> <b>a</b> fly ball to center fielder Wattie Holm.|$|E
5000|$|Going {{into the}} last game of the 1977 season Perlozzo's teammate, Rod Carew, had 99 RBIs. Perlozzo started the game at shortstop in place of Roy Smalley, and just as Perlozzo was about to bat {{for the first time}} in the game, manager Gene Mauch grabbed him by the arm and said, [...] "I want you to go up there and <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> triple, right now, this at-bat. You <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> triple, understand?" [...] Perlozzo did <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> triple, and Carew <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> single to gain his 100th RBI of the season.|$|R

The Jewish villages on the original confrontation line were Ein Gev, Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan and both Deganias.|$|E
5|$|Baseball is a bat-and-ball {{game played}} between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding. The batting team {{attempts}} to score runs by <b>hitting</b> <b>a</b> ball (that is thrown by the opposing team's pitcher) with a bat swung by the batter, and then running counter-clockwise around {{a series of}} four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.|$|E
5|$|Hornsby went {{unsigned}} by {{any team}} in 1943, but he signed as a player-manager with the Vera Cruz Blues of La Liga Mexicana in Mexico in 1944. After <b>hitting</b> <b>a</b> game-winning grand slam for the second win of a series in March, he resigned when the team owner complained that the win would diminish the crowd for the third game of the series. Following his release, he did some commentary for radio station WTMV, assisted the Cleveland Indians in spring training in 1947, and became a TV announcer for Chicago Cubs games in 1949.|$|E

5|$|In March 1991, {{during a}} game in New Jersey, Barkley {{attempted}} to spit on a fan that had been heckling with racial slurs but the result was his spit <b>hitting</b> <b>a</b> little girl. Rod Thorn, the NBA's president of operations at the time, suspended Barkley without pay and fined him $10,000 for spitting and verbally abusing the fan. It became a national story and Barkley was vilified for it. Barkley, however, eventually developed a friendship with the girl and her family. He apologized and, among other things, provided them tickets to future games.|$|E
5|$|Initiating the {{explosive}} egress system called for pushing, or <b>hitting,</b> <b>a</b> metal trigger with the hand, {{which would have}} left an unavoidably large obvious bruise, but Grissom was found {{not to have any}} of the telltale hand bruising. Still, controversy remained, and fellow Mercury astronaut Wally Schirra, {{at the end of his}} October 3, 1962, flight, remained inside his spacecraft until it was safely aboard the recovery ship, and made a point of deliberately blowing the hatch to get out, bruising his hand.|$|E
5|$|Irwin R. Schyster {{remained}} in {{control for the}} majority of his match against the 1-2-3 Kid. Although the Kid hit several kicks, Schyster regained control every time.

Schyster hit a Write Off, however, and got the pin.|$|E

5|$|No {{player has}} ever hit a cycle {{in both the}} Central and Pacific Leagues; however, after Alex Ochoa hit his cycle with the Chunichi Dragons on April 13, 2004, he became the only player to hit a cycle in both MLB and NPB. Ochoa hit his first and only cycle in the MLB eight years prior on July 3, 1996, while playing for the New York Mets. Yakult Swallows catcher Atsuya Furuta is the only player to hit for the cycle in an NPB All-Star game, hitting one in game2 of the 1992 series. Furuta's cycle is not {{considered}} an official NPB cycle as it occurred during an exhibition game. Inaba is the only player to hit for the cycle in a rain-shortened game. After <b>hitting</b> <b>a</b> triple {{in the first inning}} and <b>hitting</b> <b>a</b> home run in the fourth, Inaba collected the other two necessary hits in a seven-run fifth inning when the order batted around. Kosuke Fukudome is the only player to have hit a grand slam as the home run of the cycle.|$|E
