40|$|Abstract—Hexavalent {{chromium}} {{is highly}} toxic to most living organisms and a known human carcinogen by the inhalation route of exposure. Therefore, treatment of Cr(VI) contaminated wastewater is essential before their discharge {{to the natural}} water bodies. Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) can be beneficial because a more mobile and more toxic chromium species is converted to a less mobile and less toxic form. Zero-valence-state metals, such as <b>scrap</b> <b>iron,</b> can serve as electron donors for reducing Cr(VI) to Cr(III). The influence of pH on <b>scrap</b> <b>iron</b> capacity to reduce Cr(VI) was investigated in this study. Maximum reduction capacity of <b>scrap</b> <b>iron</b> was observed {{at the beginning of}} the column experiments; the lower the pH, the greater the experiment duration with maximum <b>scrap</b> <b>iron</b> reduction capacity. The experimental results showed that highest maximum reduction capacity of <b>scrap</b> <b>iron</b> was 12. 5 mg Cr(VI) /g <b>scrap</b> <b>iron,</b> at pH 2. 0, and decreased with increasing pH up to 1. 9 mg Cr(VI) /g <b>scrap</b> <b>iron</b> at pH = 7. 3.

40|$|Present study aims an {{experimental}} design {{based on the}} approach of Taguchi method to optimize of cementation of copper in chlorination solutions of chalcopyrite concentrate neutralized with oxidized copper ore by <b>iron</b> <b>scraps.</b> The concentrations of Fe 3 +, Cu 2 +, H+, SO 42 - and Cl- ions in the chlorination solution obtained under predetermined optimum conditions were 14. 6, 4. 0, 2. 6, 2. 2 and 124. 3 gmL- 1, respectively. The ranges of experimental parameters were between 20 - 40 oC for reaction temperature, C/ 5 -C/ 15 g.

5000|$|Filling {{the furnace}} with the {{ingredients}} is called charging. The BOS process is autogenous, i.e. the required thermal energy is produced during the oxidation process. Maintaining the proper charge balance, {{the ratio of}} hot metal, from melt, to cold scrap, is therefore very important. The BOS vessel can be tilted up to 360° and is tilted towards the deslagging side for charging scrap and hot metal. The BOS vessel is charged with steel or <b>iron</b> <b>scrap</b> (25%-30%) if required. Molten iron from the ladle is added as required for the charge balance. A typical chemistry of hotmetal charged into the BOS vessel is: 4% C, 0.2-0.8% Si, 0.08%-0.18% P, and 0.01-0.04% S, {{all of which can}} be oxidised by the supplied oxygen except sulphur (which requires reducing conditions).|$|E
