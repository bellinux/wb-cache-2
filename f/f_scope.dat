40|$|Agricultural law {{development}} {{is determined by}} factors that exist within the internal boundaries o f a given state on the one hand, and by certain international factors, on the other. While the former ones are o f a local character only, the latter comprise a number of phenomena o f a supranational character, e. g. political, economic or legal, which are responsible for political choices in individual states regarding agricultural policies, thus influencing the development o f relevant legal regulations.

And so, Polish agricultural law stands somewhat amongst globalisation, régionalisation and its local character. The resulting changes are most visible in the spheres o f domestic law that come directly under the Common Agricultural Policy.

40|$|International audienceWe {{address the}} problem of {{efficiently}} evaluating target functional dependencies (fds) in the Data Exchange (DE) process. Target fds naturally occur in many DE scenarios, including the ones in Life Sciences in which multiple source relations need to be structured under a constrained target schema. However, despite their wide use, target fds' evaluation is still a bottleneck in the state-of-the-art DE engines. Systems relying on an all-SQL approach typically do not support target fds unless additional information is provided. Alternatively, DE engines that do include these dependencies typically pay the price of a significant drop in performance and scalability. In this paper, we present a novel chase-based algorithm that can efficiently handle arbitrary fds on the target. Our approach essentially relies on exploiting the interactions between source-to-target (s-t) tuple-generating dependencies (tgds) and target fds. This allows us to tame the size of the intermediate chase results, by playing on a careful ordering of chase steps interleaving fds and (chosen) tgds. As a direct consequence, we importantly diminish the <b>fd</b> application <b>scope,</b> often a central cause of the dramatic overhead induced by target fds.

40|$|To {{determine}} the efficacy {{and costs of}} extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) compared with ureteroscopy (URS) {{in the treatment of}} mid- and lower ureteric calculi. The records of patients treated primarily by ESWL and URS were analysed retrospectively. Treatment with ESWL included 63 patients (42 men and 21 women, mean age 52 years, range 23 - 78, 19 mid- and 44 lower ureteric calculi). All patients received 4000 shock waves at a mean energy setting of 18. 1 kV. URS was used in 105 patients, with a 7. 2 F miniscope or the 7. 1 <b>F</b> flexible <b>scope.</b> Stones were fragmented with a pulsed-dye laser lithotripter at 504 nm and a power of up to 130 mJ (mean 53 mJ) using a 200 or 320 microns fibre. All ureteroscopies were performed with the patient under general (n = 17) or spinal (n = 87) anaesthesia in a mean treatment duration of 34 min. Stones were located in the mid-ureter in 24 patients and in the lower ureter in 80. The outcome was assessed by stone-free rates, re-treatment rates, time to become stone-free, complication and costs. ESWL for mid- and lower ureteric calculi resulted in a success rate of 90 % and 81 %, respectively, compared with 96 % and 99 % for URS. However, patients treated with URS were stone-free within 2 days, whereas patients in the ESWL group required up to 4 months. The best results for ESWL were achieved with stones of < 50 mm 2. The costs of URS were higher than those for ESWL. ESWL provides a noninvasive, simple and safe option for the management of mid- and lower ureteric calculi, provided that the stones are < 50 mm 2; larger stones are best treated by UR...|$|R
40|$|Commercially {{available}} products {{serve as}} good examples for the compounding pharmacist to produce quality compounded dosage forms. Their {{physical and chemical}} properties, when known, can provide valuable information for preparing similar dosage forms to patients. One of the important physical characteristics of preparations is their specific gravity. The specific gravity {{is defined as the}} density of the substance divided by the density of water at a given temperature. We purchased ten non-prescription products from a store in North Carolina. We tested three bottles of each product for their specific gravity using Densito 30 PX (Metter Toledo; Switzerland). The instrument is easy to use and allows calibration with a standard liquid (purified water or alcohol, U. S. P.) at different temperatures (0 oC to 40 oC). We measured each bottle of the same product thrice. The following products were tested for their specific gravity at room temperature: Alka-seltzer Plus (Bayer Health Care; Lot#- 276698 L); Children’s Advil (Wyeth Consumer Healthcare; Lot#-B 58397); Children’s Motrin (McNeil Consumer Healthcare; Lot#-ABM 011); Children’s Tylenol (McNeil Consumer Healthcare; Lot#-SSM 015); Children’s Zyrtec (McNeil Consumer Healthcare; Lot# for bottle 1 - 809301; Lot# for bottles 2 and 3 - 809302); Listerine (Lot#- 0619 LZ); Oral Health Rinse (TopCare; Lot#- 90 <b>F</b> 1001); <b>Scope</b> (Proctor & Gamble; Lot#- 95609187); Theraflu (Novartis Consumer Health; Lot# for bottles 1 and 3 - 10061769; Lot# for bottle 2 - 10063059); Tylenol Cold (McNeil Consumer Healthcare; Lot# for bottles 1 and 2 - 900009; Lot# for bottle 3 - 808311).

40|$|Ambient sound can impair verbal {{short-term}} memory performance. This finding {{is relevant to}} the acoustic optimization of open-plan offices. Two algorithmic approaches claim to model the impairment during a given sound condition. One model {{is based on the}} Speech Transmission Index (STI). The other approach relies on the hearing sensation fluctuation strength (<b>F).</b> Within the <b>scope</b> of our consulting activities the approach based on F can hardly be applied and the model based on the STI is often misinterpreted in terms of semanticity. Therefore we put to test the two models and elucidate the relevance of temporal-spectral variability and semanticity of background sound with regard to impairment of performance. A group of 24 subjects performed a {{short-term memory}} task and rated perceived annoyance during eight different speech and speech-like noise conditions, which varied with regard to STI and F. The empirical data is compared to the model predictions, which only partly cover the experimental results. Speech impairs performance more than all other sound conditions and variable speech-like noise is more impairing than continuous speech-like noise. Sound masking with continuous speech-like noise provides relief from the negative effect of background speech. This positive effect is more pronounced if the signal to noise ratio is - 3 dB(A) or even lower...|$|R

40|$|ICFC 2017 - International Conference on Food Contaminants (Book of Abstracts) A novel {{alternative}} for mycotoxins decontamination {{is the use}} of microorganisms that bind mycotoxins and reduce their gastrointestinal absorption. Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts were isolated from a Kefir culture and evaluated for their mycotoxin adsorption and biotransformation ability. Strains with high binding ability were identified based on DNA sequenci ng. The binding stability was determined by washing the complexes microorganism/mycotoxin with buffer solutions to simulate the pH conditions in the gastrointestinal tract. The results indicate that the microorganism consortium of Kefir grains adsorbed 82 to 100 % of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), zearalenone (ZEA) and ochratoxin A (OTA) when cultivated in milk. The most effective strains in adsorbing the mycotoxins were identified as Lactobacillus kefiri, Kazachstania servazzii and Acetobacter syzygii. The strains L. kefiri KFLM 3 was able to adsorb 80 to 100 % of the mycotoxins when cultivated in milk. However, desorption experiments showed that yeast K. servazzii KFGY 7 retained more mycotoxin (65, 69 and 67 % for AFB 1, OTA and ZEA, respectively) in the cells. Our findings revealed that kefir consumption can possibly reduce gastrointestinal absorption of these mycotoxins and consequently reduce their toxic effects.

40|$|Significant {{research}} {{progress has}} recently been made in estimating fluorescence in the oxygen absorption bands, however, quantitative retrieval of fluorescence data is still affected by factors such as atmospheric effects. In this paper, top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance is generated by the MODTRAN 4 and SCOPE models. Based on simulated data, sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the sensitivities of four indicators—depth_absorption_band, depth_nofs-depth_withfs, radiance and Fs/radiance—to atmospheric parameters (sun zenith angle (SZA), sensor height, elevation, visibility (VIS) and water content) in the oxygen absorption bands. The {{results indicate that the}} SZA and sensor height are the most sensitive parameters and that variations in these two parameters result in large variations calculated as the variation value/the base value in the oxygen absorption depth in the O 2 -A and O 2 -B bands (111. 4 % and 77. 1 % in the O 2 -A band; and 27. 5 % and 32. 6 % in the O 2 -B band, respectively). A comparison of fluorescence retrieval using three methods (Damm method, Braun method and DOAS) and <b>SCOPE</b> <b>Fs</b> indicates that the Damm method yields good results and that atmospheric correction can improve the accuracy of fluorescence retrieval. Damm method is the improved 3 FLD method but considering atmospheric effects. Finally, hyperspectral airborne images combined with other parameters (SZA, VIS and water content) are exploited to estimate fluorescence using the Damm method and 3 FLD method. The retrieval fluorescence is compared with the field measured fluorescence, yielding good results (R 2 = 0. 91 for Damm vs. SCOPE SIF; R 2 = 0. 65 for 3 FLD vs. SCOPE SIF).

5000|$|In R v Dawson, a {{petrol station}} {{attendant}} {{with a weak}} heart died of heart failure when the appellant attempted a robbery of the station. In judging whether this act was sufficiently dangerous, the Court of Appeal applied a test based on the [...] "sober and reasonable" [...] bystander who could be assumed {{to know that the}} use of a replica gun was likely to terrify people and so be a danger to those with a weak heart. Note the aggravated form of criminal damage with intent to endanger life under section 1(2) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 which could provide the unlawful act if the damage actually causes death. But R v Carey, C and <b>F</b> limits the <b>scope</b> of unlawful act manslaughter. An argument became violent and the first defendant punched and kicked one victim. The second defendant assaulted the deceased by pulling her hair back and punching her in the face. The third defendant assaulted another. The deceased {{was one of the first}} to run away, after which she felt faint, and later died of a heart condition (ventricular fibrillation or dysrhythmia) which was congenital but which had not been diagnosed before her death. The unlawful act was said to be the affray and the judge held that it was legitimate to aggregate the violence by the other defendants in order to decide whether the affray had subjected the deceased to the threat of at least some physical harm, and so had been a cause of death. On appeal, it was inappropriate to hold the defendants liable for the death. There must be an unlawful act that was dangerous in the sense that sober and reasonable persons would recognise that the act was such as to subject Y to the risk of physical harm. In turn, that act must cause the death. When deciding whether an act is dangerous, knowledge of the victim's characteristics may be relevant. In this case, no reasonable person would have been aware of the victim's heart condition which distinguishes this case from Dawson, and from R v Watson in which the victim's approximate age (he was 87 years old) and frail state would have been obvious to a reasonable person. A sober and reasonable person would not have foreseen that an apparently healthy person of 15 years would suffer shock as a result of it. The court held that the deceased's death was not caused by injuries that were a foreseeable result of the affray. The assault by the second defendant was an unlawful act causing death. The other two defendants could have been convicted by virtue of common purpose given that the death was an accidental departure from the general plan of the affray. But the Crown did not elect to present the case in this way, but pleaded the case as a public order group activity. The result would be that if anyone died in a general disturbance amounting to an affray, all those who participated could be convicted of manslaughter which would be against public policy. Deaths in a general disturbance are too remote to be caused by all participants.|$|R
