[...] Waite {{felt he could}} not risk being ejected for {{fighting}} under {{the belief that the}} game would resume, and that the Canadian backup goaltender, Shawn Simpson, was injured. [...] Steve Nemeth would later apply for early reinstatement arguing that he was not fighting, but trying to help break the players apart. [...] Many of their teammates never forgave Turgeon for failing to defend his teammates. In the words of Everett Sanipass: [...] "I'm looking for someone to help (Stéphane) Roy out and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the bench. [...] There's this dog Turgeon, just sitting there, with his head down.

60|$|When I {{came home}} to dinner my uncle {{had not yet been}} home. Still it was early. I sat staring at the clock for some time and, when its ticking began to irritate me, I left the room. I mounted the {{staircase}} and gained {{the upper part of the}} house. The high cold empty gloomy rooms liberated me and I went from room to room singing. From the front window I saw my companions playing below in the street. Their cries reached me weakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead against the cool glass, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the dark house where she lived. I may have stood there for an hour, seeing nothing but the brown-clad figure cast by my imagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved neck, at the hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress.|$|E
60|$|Twice, whilst I {{had been}} reading this engrossing narrative, I had thought that I had seen across the page streaks of shade, which the weirdness of the subject had made to seem like {{the shadow of a}} hand. On the first of these {{occasions}} I found that the illusion came from the fringe of green silk around the lamp; but on the second I had looked up, and my eyes had lit on the mummy hand across the room on which the starlight was falling under the edge of the blind. It was of little wonder that I had connected it with such a narrative; for if my eyes told me truly, here, in this room with me, was the very hand of which the traveller Van Huyn had written. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> the bed; and it comforted me to think that the Nurse still sat there, calm and wakeful. At such a time, with such surrounds, during such a narrative, it was well to have assurance of the presence of some living person.|$|E

She describes her experience co-facilitating the SSSC seminar and working with college students engaged in service learning in order to foster a deeper spiritual understanding and motivate students toward social change in their communities through their service work. It was mid-way through a lively class discussion when Sally asked, “How do we separate our beliefs from stereotypes in working towards social justice? ” The students looked at me with their pens steady. Sally had been struggling with feeling unsafe on her morning walk through San Francisco’s Tenderloin district to her summer public service fellowship at Planned Parenthood for the past couple weeks. I tried to conjure up all the student development theories I learned in graduate school, but my mind was blank. Maybe Rev. McLennan would say something? But when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> him, he was also eagerly awaiting my response. Pens started tapping. After a few moments of silence in the classroom, I managed to squeak, “That’s a great question, Sally. Many of us experience a similar tension. Would anyone like to comment? ” Pens dropped. Someone yawned. ...|$|E
60|$|We {{were now}} tearing {{through the water}} at such pace that the boat flung {{a good deal of}} what she {{displaced}} all over her, but a glance at the dark pines ashore showed that she was making very little to windward, while, when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> my shoulder <b>at</b> the boiling wake astern, it was too plainly evident that, owing to the loss of the centerboard, we were driving bodily sideways as well as ahead. Also the snowy froth which lapped higher up the lee deck was perilously near the coaming protecting the open well. Still, our expectant friends stood clustered among the boulders fringing one horn of the bay, and I saw that Caryl held a rope in his hand. We might just pass within reach of it on the next tack.|$|R

I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are.

5000|$|You may {{say that}} Corrigan's flight could not be {{compared}} to Lindbergh's in its sensational appeal as the first solo flight across the ocean. Yes, but in another way the obscure little Irishman's flight was the more audacious of the two. Lindbergh had a plane specially constructed, the finest money could buy. He had lavish financial backing, friends to help him at every turn. Corrigan had nothing but his own ambition, courage, and ability. His plane, a nine-year-old Curtiss Robin, was the most wretched-looking jalopy.As <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> it <b>at</b> the Dublin airdrome I really marveled that anyone should have been rash enough even {{to go in the}} air with it, much less try to fly the Atlantic. He built it, or rebuilt it, practically as a boy would build a scooter out of a soapbox and a pair of old roller skates. It looked it. The nose of the engine hood was a mass of patches soldered by Corrigan himself into a crazy-quilt design. The door behind which Corrigan crouched for twentyeight hours was fastened together with a piece of baling wire. The reserve gasoline tanks put together by Corrigan, left him so little room that he had to sit hunched forward with his knees cramped, and not enough window space to see the ground when landing.|$|R
40|$|Environmental Writing and Great Lakes LiteratureMy mom and I sat on {{the rock}} in silence, enjoying the little {{sunshine}} that had finally broken through the thick covering of gray clouds. We passed her water bottle back and forth again, and <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> her face, studying it for longer than a comfortable second. She had a placid look, almost like she was finally {{at a place where}} she felt comfortable. I suddenly felt an intense urge to say something to her. I felt the words bubbling up my throat; I wanted her to know that I appreciated her working so hard at ajob she hated for my education, I wanted to tell her that it was okay we didn't say everything to each other, I wanted to tell her I care. At the last minute, when I thought the words were going to spill out of my mouth, I swallowed hard and bit them back. Maybe too much time had passed for my empty words to change anything; maybe it just wasn't worth it. For a few more moments we sat and took all the scenery in, and after a while, my mother suggested we start heading back down the trail to the car. She didn't want me to have to waste my whole day out hiking when I could be doing something fun with friends. I quietly tried to protest, but I just held my tongue. I took one last look out over Rattlesnake Ridge and hoped that maybe my mom and I didn't need to talk things over. I hoped that I didn't need to say all those things for her to know them. Regardless of what I said or didn't say, I thought that our yearly reunions on Rattlesnake meant something. The annual pilgrimage I made for my mother teetering to the ledge looking over the plummeting abyss was a testament of our bond together. I know this feeble gesture isn't the same, but maybe, hopefully, it's enough...|$|E

40|$|I {{have studied}} the forms of mycorrhizae and {{xerophytes}} to gain inspiration for a water system upgrade. This process of emulating natural forms and strategies is called biomimicry. The U. S. Forest Service is in the preliminary stages of an upgrade for an aging water system at the Prospector Campground in the White River National Forest. Forest Service engineers and designers will use my research as they redesign this system. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>over</b> twenty plants to find adaptations that helped manage water efficiently. I chose to study mycorrhizae and xerophytes because of their wide range and prevalence. Mycorrhiza is a symbiotic relationship between fungi and plants. Mycorrhizae are successful water absorbers because of their extensive surface area and ability to alter osmotic gradients. A branched system with appendages decreasing in size will {{increase the amount of}} water absorbed. A well built with these principles would increase water available to campers. Xerophytes are plants that thrive in low water environments. This is facilitated by many adaptations. A thick, waxy cuticle and small, low-density stomata reduce evaporation. Shedding of foliage saves water in times of drought. I suggest installing aerators with lower water flow on the spigots throughout the campground to reduce water use...|$|R
6000|$|And think, if {{one could}} love a woman like that once, see her once grow pale with passion, and once wring your lips out upon hers, {{would it not be}} a small thing to die? Not {{that there is not a}} passion of a quite other sort, much less epic, far more {{dramatic}} and intimate, that comes out of the very frailty of perishable women; out of the lines of suffering that we see written about their eyes, and that we may wipe out if it were but for a moment; out of the thin hands, wrought and tempered in agony to a fineness of perception, that the indifferent or the merely happy cannot know; out of the tragedy that lies about such a love, and the pathetic incompleteness.

40|$|As <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at {{the present}} spiritual climate and did field-work in neo-shamanic courses in England and Denmark {{it became clear to}} me that there was, if not a denial, then {{definitely}} an understatement of the evil or negative aspects of human spirituality. Although some of my informants had, indeed, experienced frightening and destructive spiritual encounters they mostly did not share them with their fellow participants as the atmosphere of the courses was that of benevolence emanating from the spirit-world. In the lower world the spirits seemed to be waiting readily for the course participants who were then generously supported by the spirits in their endeavours. A sort of ecologically correct lower world paradise was displayed. This was in such conflict with my understanding of the traditional shaman, that <b>I</b> decided to <b>look</b> at the archives at the Religious Experience Research Centre founded by Alister Hardy in 1969 and search for negative experiences to discover if there was evidence of modern Western people having had encounters that somehow were a manifestation of evil, destructive spirits, or the devil. There are about 6, 000 letters, of which <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>over</b> 4, 000, as the archive is presently being updated and the records put on computer. These letters were sent to the Research Centre by people who responded to the call for descriptions of spiritual experiences by Sir Alister Hardy and others involved in the research from the 1960 s onwards. In this collection I found about 170 accounts or discussions of evil. I initially decided to use the word 'negative' instead of evil in my title for this collection, but as I worked through the material, I reverted to the term that most writers use themselves: evil...|$|R

So the captain roars down the hatchway, `Tumble up there! tumble up! every man alive! for your lives!' And sure enough they did tumble up, as I never seed 'em do it before--two or three of 'em was sick; they came up with their clothes in their hands. The ice was now almost touchin' our sides, and I tell you, sir, I never did feel so queerish in all my life before as when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> the side <b>at</b> the edge of that great field of ice which rose three foot out o' the water, and was, I suppose, six foot more below the surface. It came on so slow that we could hardly see the motion. Inch by inch the water narrowed between it and our sides. At last it touched on the left side, and that shoved us quicker on to the field on our right. Every eye was fixed on it--every man held his breath. You might have heard a pin fall on the deck. It touched gently at first, then there was a low grindin' and crunchin' sound. The ship trembled {{as if it had been}} a livin' creetur, and the beams began to crack. Now, you must know, sir, that when a nip o' this sort takes a ship the ice usually eases off, after giving her a good squeeze, or when the {{pressure}} is too much for her, the ice slips under her bottom and lifts her right out o' the water. But our Nancy was what we call wall-sided. She was never fit to sail in them seas. The consequence was that the ice crushed her sides in. The moment the captain heard the beams begin to go he knew it was all up with the ship; so he roared to take to the ice for our lives! You may be sure we took his advice. Over the side we went, every man Jack of us, and got on the ice. We did not take time to save an article belongin' to us; and it was as well we did not, for the ice closed up with a crash, and we heard the beams and timbers rending like a fire of musketry in the hold. Her bottom must have been cut clean away, for she stood on the ice just as she had floated on the sea. Then the noise stopped, the ice eased off, and the ship began to settle. The lead of water opened up again; in ten minutes after that the Nancy went to the bottom and left us standing there on the ice.|$|R
