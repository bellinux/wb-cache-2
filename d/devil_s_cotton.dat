40|$|Textiles {{and apparel}} trade has been {{governed by the}} Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA) for three decades. Trade {{restrictions}} have generated substantial welfare losses and price wedges in exporting and importing countries through trade distortions. Beginning in 1995, textiles and apparel trade underwent fundamental changes in trade flows and patterns. The World Trade Organization??s Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) aimed to remove all MFA quotas by January 2005. This study established an equilibrium displacement model to investigate the impact on textile and cotton sectors of different countries and country-groups of removing the MFA quota. The model specifies the basic linkages of textile and cotton markets in the United States, China and four other country-groups. With different assumptions about U. S. textile supply elasticity, foreign cotton exporters?? reaction {{and changes in the}} U. S. farm program payments, alternative scenarios are simulated to predict changes in domestic and import demand for textiles and apparel, import demand for U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton,</b> domestic and import price of textiles and apparel, U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> price and adjusted world cotton price. Uniform distribution was imposed for selected parameters involved in the model to overcome the deficiency of equilibrium displacement models of assuming certainty of known related parameters. Results indicate increased import demand for U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> by China, higher U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> supply, more textile and apparel supply from China, decreased domestic demand for U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton,</b> and lower U.

Holding other assumptions unchanged, when farm program payments increase, U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> price and adjusted world cotton price declined.

40|$|Cotton {{export markets}} are {{becoming}} increasingly important to U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> industry following a decline in domestic mill demand driven by increased imports of textile and apparel from the developing countries. Further decline in domestic mill use is expected because of recent liberalizations in textile trade as part of Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC). As a result, future U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> exports will have to increase from their current record level to avoid domestic stock piling. Today, U. <b>S.</b> <b>cotton</b> exports are much more concentrated in a few large markets than twenty years ago.
