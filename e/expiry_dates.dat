5|$|Further {{denominations}} {{ranging from}} $5000 to $500 million were issued {{in the period}} between August 2006 and May 2008 as cent cheques quickly became outmoded. In {{the second quarter of}} 2008, special Agro cheques (Agricultural Cheques) were issued in denominations ranging from $5 billion to $100 billion as the currency exchange rate was floated. Since the functions were similar to Bearer cheques, it was in regular use as prices continue to rise. These cheques also carried time limits and limited security features. In the final months of the second dollar, the $200000 cheque was the lowest legal tender denomination by decree, despite having its expiry date extended twice. The $100000000 Bearer Cheque would have been the lowest legal tender denomination in circulation had the <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> of currency cheques been enforced without extension, with the $100 billion Agro Cheque being the highest whether or not the $200000 note was legal tender.|$|E

50|$|Article 31 The {{first day}} is not covered within the terms stipulated by the Chinese Copyright Protection Center. The <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> is the {{corresponding}} {{day of the}} last month if the term is counted by year or by month; the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> is the last day if no corresponding day in the month.

50|$|For {{overnight}} trades, the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> is {{the next}} week-day after the horizon date, and the delivery date is calculated from the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> {{in the same way}} as spot is calculated from the horizon date. This will result in an <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> that is before the spot date.|$|R
5000|$|For a {{trade with}} time to expiry of y months, the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> is found by first calculating the spot date, then moving forward y months from the spot {{date to the}} {{delivery}} date. If the delivery date is a non-business day or a US holiday, move forward until an acceptable delivery date is found. Finally, calculate the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> using an [...] "inverse spot" [...] operation; e.g., find the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> for which the delivery date would be its spot. When finding the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> from the delivery date, there must be one clear business day and one weekday (not including 1 January) in any applicable non-USD/non-CAD, non-USD/non-TRY, non-USD/non-PHP, non-USD/non-RUB, non-USD/non-KZT and non-USD/non-PKR currency. If one leg of the currency pair is a non-deliverable currency, the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> must be a business day of that currency.|$|R

Also, advertisements have <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> and once the <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> have been reached, the campaign will have to be started again. Thus, the return on investment of advertisement campaigns is rather low most of the time. Outbound marketing is often considered to be a poorly targeted technique as it cannot be personalised to specific customers. Moreover, advertisements often interrupt customers and as such, they may be wrongly considered by potential consumers.|$|E
