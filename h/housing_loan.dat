40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the accessibility of}} <b>housing</b> <b>loans</b> on homeownership in Urban China. Greater accessibility to <b>housing</b> <b>loans</b> {{is expected to have}} a positive effect on consumers' housing purchase decision. In China, <b>housing</b> <b>loans</b> have achieved rapid growth since the reform of the housing market in 1998. Since the reform of housing market and the accelerated urbanization of China, the demand of houses increases dramatically.
