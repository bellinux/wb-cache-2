40|$|The heat {{sealability}} of laminated films with linear {{low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) as the sealant materials was investigated. A laboratory heat sealer was used to study the response of laminated films to temperature, time, and pressure. Platen temperature was confirmed as primary factor in controlling heat-seal strength. Dwell time must be sufficiently long to bring the interfacial temperature to a desired level. When the desired heat-seal strength has been achieved, further increase of dwell time did not improved heat-seal strength. Platen pressure had little effect above the level required to flatten the materials for good contact. Bar sealing process window for each sample were developed. The optimum combination of platen temperature and dwell time for each laminated film can be obtained in the respective process windows. Strength of heat-seal and its failure modes are closely related. Plateau initiation temperature closely corresponds to the final melting point of sealant materials. Relatively higher platen temperature was required to seal laminated films with lower thermal conductance. Required dwell time corresponds closely to the heat flow rate of bar sealing process. Laminated films made from <b>extrusion</b> <b>lamination</b> process provided lower level of achievable heat seal strength when compared with the laminated films made from dry-bond lamination proces...|$|E
40|$|Ductility of {{aluminum}} alloys is highly used in automotive applications where crashworthiness becomes relevant. Due to its physical and mechanical properties, aluminum allows structures {{to be designed}} with good capacity to absorb energy, without increasing the overall weight of cars. In particular, high elongation allows for the conversion of {{a great amount of}} kinetic energy related to crash events in plastic deformation. If this was not the case, the energy involved during an accident could interest also the occupants, causing serious injuries. During large deformation of structures, chassis components may be subjected to failure, limiting the capacity of energy absorption. Therefore, the capability to predict the behavior of structures under crash loads becomes very important during the cars design process. Under these circumstances, finite element analysis is useful to simulate the response and to validate a project. In the last few years, prediction of materials behavior has become relevant in order to simulate in the best possible way the reaction of structures under dynamic loads. Contrary to what was expected, aluminum alloy might show anisotropic behavior after manufacturing processes. <b>Extrusion,</b> <b>lamination</b> and forging processes can modify crystallography, grains shape, precipitates and dislocations structures, affecting considerably the plastic properties. Furthermore, the failure limit strictly depends on the stress-strain state in the material during the crash event. Tensile state, shear state, compressive state and mixing states generally return different failure limits. Hence, it is indispensable to arrange a huge experimental campaign to define a thorough characterization of an aluminum alloy. Finite element (FE) codes give the possibility to include all these aspects, but several parameters need to be finely tuned. By limiting the number of tests, the present work aims at obtaining the numerical-experimental correlation of some crash absorbers during an impact. Tensile and shear specimens have been cut from the extruded parts of the chassis in 0 °, 45 ° and 90 ° with respect to the extrusion direction. It is possible to define a fracture locus curve that identifies the equivalent strain limit of the aluminum alloys studied. For instance, Johnson-Cook and Bao-Wierzbicki criteria for aluminum alloys have been defined starting from a complete experimental campaign. They also give approximated analytical functions to define the entire fracture locus curve depending on the stress state. Uniaxial tensile and shear failure limits are the only ones taken into account in this work. Different hypothesis have been considered to define the rest of the fracture locus. Tuning the function parameters of the chosen criteria, a failure curve for compression, shear, tensile and mixing states have been set according to the experimental tests performed. The material card obtained has been further refined during the numerical-experimental correlation of both the samples and the crash absorbers: mesh size effects have been taken into account to assess the approximations of stress and strain into shell elements. In this work, fine mesh is only used during the initial correlation of specimens. This allows for considerably reducing the computational time of FE models studied. Acceleration signals and failures have been monitored in the crash absorbers. A high correlation between the experimental and numerical tests have validated the current methodology. Because of the few experimental tests performed on samples, {{it is not possible to}} study the exact mesh scaling effects at the beginning. Further refining is needed during the correlation of the whole component to get the right failures. In any case, the error given by the experimental dispersion could compromise the correlation and this is the reason why accuracy is not always necessary during the first phases of the correlation settings...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this short}} review is to present the {{different}} applications of NIR spectroscopy to monitor and describe physical and chemical modifications during wheat products processing. The dynamic NIR spectroscopy for cereal products concerns mostly in-line monitoring of unit operations involved in transformation of wheat flour to food products. NIR spectroscopy has been mainly investigated as an in-line method to monitor bread dough mixing. Other applications such as flour agglomeration process, pasta <b>extrusion</b> and <b>lamination</b> process, dough proofing, thermal treatments and product storage have also been investigated...|$|R
40|$|Electrostatic corona {{pretreatment}} {{has traditionally}} been a very cost-efficient treatment method to optimize adhesion levels during the <b>extrusion</b> coating and <b>lamination</b> process. While it is cost-effective, the residence times may be insufficient to permit penetration of the active species that effect change into the surfaces of web materials. Low-pressure plasmas {{have been used for}} many years to surface treat three-dimensional plastic objects and polymer films, therefore, the benefits of plasma treatment are well recognized: reduced degradation of surface morphology, higher treatment (dyne) levels, elimination of backside treatment, and extended life of treatment over time. However, the complexity, slow speed and high cost of these contained plasma systems make them impractical for all but the most esoteric applications. Now a system has been developed that allows plasmas to be sustained at atmospheric pressure in a way that permits the surface treatment of substrates to enhance adhesion strength and hot tack in the <b>extrusion</b> coating and <b>lamination</b> processes on a continuous web handling system similar to a corona treating system. The Atmospheric Plasma Treatment (APT) process allows treatment in a broad range of reactive chemistries and has been successfully tested on various films, foils, nonwovens and metals. Further, depending upon the dyne level required and type of material, line speeds in excess of 400 fpm are practical and beyond 1, 000 fpm have been achieved. Specialty applications requiring stringent surface morphology specifications, specific surface modification such as hydrophilicity, precise surface coating or tightly controlled electrical characteristics will find the APT system especially attractive and useful...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen {{scavengers}} {{are used}} in food packaging to protect oxygen-sensitive food products. A mixture of gallic acid (GA) and sodium carbonate {{was used as an}} oxygen scavenger (OSc) in bio-based multilayer packaging films produced in a three-step process: compounding, flat film <b>extrusion,</b> and <b>lamination.</b> We investigated the film surface color as well as oxygen absorption at different relative humidities (RHs) and temperatures, and compared the oxygen absorption of OSc powder, monolayer films, and multilayer films. The films were initially brownish-red in color but changed to greenish-black during oxygen absorption under humid conditions. We observed a maximum absorption capacity of 447 mg O 2 /g GA at 21 °C and 100 % RH. The incorporation of GA into a polymer matrix reduced the rate of oxygen absorption compared to the GA powder because the polymer acted as a barrier to oxygen and water vapor diffusion. As expected, the temperature had a significant effect on the initial absorption rate of the multilayer films; the corresponding activation energy was 75. 4 kJ/mol. Higher RH significantly increased the oxygen absorption rate. These results demonstrate {{for the first time the}} production and the properties of a bio-based multilayer packaging film with GA as the oxygen scavenger. Potential applications include the packaging of food products with high water activity (aw > 0. 86) ...|$|R
40|$|The food {{packaging}} industry demands cheap polymer films possessing a high barrier agains permeation of gases, moisture and flavor. Candidates {{for the most}} successful materials fulfilling these requirements are newly developed laminates of biaxial oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films containing a thin inorganic barrier layer and possessing an oxygen permeability lower than 3 cm 3 /(m 2 /dbar) and a moisture permeability lower than 0. 05 g/m 2 day). The thin barrier layers are produced by vacuum web coating of BOPP films. In order to achieve high barrier laminates, one key issue along the whole production chain - from film <b>extrusion</b> to <b>lamination</b> - is given by the surface properties of the non-coated films. Non-coated BOPP film surfaces were modified by different kinds of plasma pretreatment and characterized before the vacuum coating process. The functionality - as adhesion and permeation - of coated barrier films and final high barrier laminates was studied {{as a function of}} pretreatment parameters. The BOPP homopolymer or copolymer films were either pretreated subsequent to the film production by a standard corona atmosphere plasma or in situ before the vacuum web coating by an oxygen low-pressure plasma. The topography of non-treated and pretreated films was analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the chemical surface properties by contact angle measurement as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These BOPP films were vacuum web coated with aluminium (Al), aluminium oxide (AlOx) or silicon oxide (SiOx) and laminated with a two-component adhesive system. Typical pretreatment parameters of BOPP films necessary for high barrier laminates after coating and lamination could be identified...|$|R
50|$|The first plastic tarp gym {{floor cover}} was invented and {{manufactured}} by Covermaster Inc. in 1969 with Seattle-based Floor Guardian Inc. following up by manufacturing a recycled content, removable, portable carpet based protection {{system in the}} late 1970s to answer the demand for a product that was less of a trip hazard, environmentally sound and classier looking than what many felt was basically a painter's tarp. Since then {{the quality of the}} materials has greatly evolved. Most manufacturers have switched from vinyl and polyethylene materials to more durable polyester fabric. In 2013, Protex Matting Inc. answered environmental concerns by introducing the newest 100% recycled polyester top cloth gym floor covers made completely from recycled plastic water bottles, saving approximately 7000 water bottles for every 10,000 sq. ft produced. The best plastic tarp gym floor covers today are made of single-layer woven polyester and the newest polymer materials with utilization of the knife-coating process, which enables dyes to be deposited deep into the core of the PVC. material and prevent peeling of the layers - a side effect of <b>extrusion</b> coating or <b>lamination</b> process..|$|R
40|$|The work {{describes}} {{the realization of}} a composite material based on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) plus polycarbonate (PC). The potential of this composite for macroscopic applications is evaluated. To provide high qualitative SWCNTs, apparatus for the laser based synthesis of nanotubes was designed. This process reactor utilises two laser systems of very different wavelengths (Nd:YAG, CO 2) in parallel operation mode. The evaluation of the synthesis process and the synthesis product depends upon a novel methodology of measurement (quality control protocol). The PC/SWCNT-composites were produced with three different techniques: melt <b>extrusion,</b> coagulation and <b>lamination.</b> Furthermore, the SWCNT material was taken from three different sources: arc discharge, laser ablation and HiPco™. To provide special characteristics and synergy effects in the composite a third phase (carbon fibers) was introduced in some composites. Additionally the chemical functionalization of SWCNTs was explored. All composites were examined concerning their ability to attenuate electromagnetic radiation (keywords EMC, EMI) and to conduct heat. Also their mechanical and electrical (keyword ESD) properties were determined. It is shown that SWCNTs in PC, representative of amorphous thermo plastics, do not inevitably lead to higher mechanical values. However, SWCNTs in PC shift the electrical percolation threshold to much lower filler contents than, for example, carbon black (CB). SWCNTs effectively attenuate electromagnetic radiation and they can enhance the thermal conductivity of the entire material system...|$|R

From the 1980 ’s, Amcor began diversifying its interests and is now a true multinational with operations in 38 different countries. Amcor Flexibles is a division of Amcor and is responsible for flexible plastic packaging. It has a significant market share in the plastics market as well as supplying many well-known companies with flexible plastic products. Amcor Flexibles offers many products including printed or plain, single or multi layered plastic films, bags and other plastic based products. Currently Amcor Flexibles Acacia Ridge develops its products in four independent stages; <b>extrusion,</b> printing, <b>lamination</b> and conversion. Amcor Flexibles Acacia Ridge produces printed plastic products which vary in print design complexity, quantity, size and features. Due to recent changes in how the business operates, the documentation for the supply chain processes is now outdated and needs updating. There have also been changes in the Oliver Wight Class A process on which Amcor Flexibles follows. Therefore, the existing documentation is not sufficient and new documents must be created to adhere to these changes. The CEED project has been established in order to create and amend all necessary documents for the upcoming compliance audit. It will also serve to maintain Amcor Flexibles’ high standard in supply chain management and allow managerial personnel to have clear and precise documentation on the supply chain processes. This research comprised of identifying the areas of the documentation relating to the supply chain processes currently performed at Amcor Flexibles Acacia Ridge, that are currently obsolete and new aspects and concepts that require addition.
