40|$|By {{the very}} nature of what they do as scientists, sociologists and anthropologists are {{necessarily}} always <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> other people. They are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> other people <b>the</b> way physicists are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> electrons and detectors, the way chemists are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> chemicals and test tubes, the way biologists are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> cells and frogs. Very often now, on account of developments in social studies of science since the late 1960 s, sociologists and anthropologists find – or rather plant – themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> other researchers. Sometimes, and sometimes annoyingly, they plant themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> other researchers while they are engaged in their research or related professional activities. Sometimes the sociologists and anthropologists are participants who contribute to the research agenda of their subjects; sometimes they observe and interview as non-participants. Given this reality of their work, sociologists and anthropologists can or must appear at least on occasion intruders, pricks of conscience, or moral entrepreneurs, and obstacles rather than facilitators of research. This role of ethnographer of science, however, has proven itself over and over {{to be a source of}} important new insights and understandings about the nature of scientific practice. They can, of course, at the same time serve as the consciousness as well as the conscience of the research group. I have planted myself in your midst in part to continue my empirical studies of scientific and engineering practice. The other reasons I am here have to do with my interests in social robotics per se as a sociologist of mind and thinking...|$|R

500|$|The storylines that {{involved}} Rachel received mixed commentary. Both Poniewozik and Stack appreciated the pairing of Rachel and Kurt: the former called them [...] "probably the strongest pairing" [...] {{of the episode}} due to similarities in their characterization, and the latter lauded Rachel's line [...] "I know you're lonely...but you're not alone" [...] as [...] "an incredibly powerful statement coming <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> these gay youth suicides further illuminates the relevance and importance of a show like Glee." [...] Fallon said that the episode [...] "added some flavor" [...] {{to the relationship between}} Rachel and Finn, which was [...] "in danger of going stale", and Berk noted that [...] "Duets" [...] {{was the first time he}} had ever been [...] "marginally compelled" [...] by a storyline which involved the pair.

It peaked at number 10 on Britain's national singles chart and number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 in America; the other US chart compilers, Cash Box and Record World, placed the single at number 20 and number 13, respectively. [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] attracted sustained airplay {{in the days leading}} up to the concerts, and lent the relief project an authentic social and political significance. A Bangladeshi academic, Professor Farida Majid, would later write: [...] "To the utter consternation of [...] Nixon and [...] Kissinger, George Harrison's 'Bangla Desh' hit the chart. It was a thrilling moment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the sad news emanating from the battlefront.

500|$|Of {{the opera}} itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: [...] "There were neither {{fishermen}} in the libretto nor pearls in the music". He considered that on every page the score displayed [...] "the bias {{of the school}} to which [...] belongs, that of Richard Wagner". Bertrand compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David. [...] "Nevertheless", he wrote, [...] "there is a talent floating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> these regrettable imitations". Hector Berlioz was a voice apart in the general critical hostility; his review {{of the work in}} Journal des Débats praised the music's originality and subtlety: [...] "The score of Les pêcheurs de perles does M. Bizet the greatest honour", he wrote. Among Bizet's contemporaries, the dramatist Ludovic Halévy wrote that this early work announced Bizet as a composer of quality: [...] "I persist in finding in [...] the rarest virtues". The youthful composer Émile Paladilhe told his father that the opera was superior to anything that the established French opera composers of the day, such as Auber and Thomas, were capable of producing.|$|E
500|$|The A.V.

[...] Murray continued that he [...] "especially liked... that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> this end-times rush, it pauses periodically to check in with the various characters in short one-on-one scenes, strengthening our sense of what these relationships mean. (It's something that Fringe has gotten good at in the past year-and-a-half, and something I wouldn't have predicted for the show back in season one.)" [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson noted Fringe is preparing for the finale, calling [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] a [...] "movement episode [...] give an opportunity to get everyone into place for the big climax" [...] in a vein similar to the television series Lost. Hanson enjoyed the two [...] "sleights of hand", explaining he was surprised by Fauxlivia's universe-crossing device failing and what happened to Peter after touching the machine.|$|E

There {{was no need to}} worry about a backing track or a bum note, a pleasant realization at a pop show." [...] Herald Suns Cameron Adams opined that One Direction have [...] "strong pop voices". Melody Lau of the National Post wrote, [...] "It's easy to get lost in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the love-struck squeals of teenage girls are guys who can actually sing and, to a certain extent, entertain." [...] Jane Stevenson of the portal site Canoe concurred: [...] "What I didn't really prepare myself for was that they all can actually sing in concert." [...] Chris Richards, writing in The Washington Post, dissented from the approval: [...] "As the five traded couplets, it was tough to imagine a future Justin Timberlake, Ricky Martin or Bobby Brown emerging from the pack. No one voice stood out." [...] Mike Wass of Idolator felt One Direction's [...] "surprisingly accomplished effort" [...] of Kings of Leon's [...] "Use Somebody" [...] proved that One Direction are [...] "more than capable" [...] of evolving their sound.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the first}} actions of Hitler's {{administration}} was the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service which removed Jews and politically suspect government employees (including university professors) from their jobs unless they had [...] "demonstrated their loyalty to Germany" [...] by serving in World War I. In April 1933 Noether received a notice from the Prussian Ministry for Sciences, Art, and Public Education which read: [...] "On the basis of paragraph 3 of the Civil Service Code of 7 April 1933, I hereby withdraw from {{you the right to}} teach at the University of Göttingen." [...] Several of Noether's colleagues, including Max Born and Richard Courant, also had their positions revoked. Noether accepted the decision calmly, providing support for others during this difficult time. Hermann Weyl later wrote that [...] "Emmy Noether—her courage, her frankness, her unconcern about her own fate, her conciliatory spirit—was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the hatred and meanness, despair and sorrow surrounding us, a moral solace." [...] Typically, Noether remained focused on mathematics, gathering students in her apartment to discuss class field theory. When one of her students appeared in the uniform of the Nazi paramilitary organization Sturmabteilung (SA), she showed no sign of agitation and, reportedly, even laughed about it later. This, however, was before the bloody events of Kristallnacht in 1938, and their praise from Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebels.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Conan sidekick Andy Richter {{left the}} show, and Weinberg became the [...] "second banana". Weinberg {{continued}} {{to present an}} obvious visual foil: as O'Brien said, [...] "If you looked at this guy you would never know he was the drummer in a huge rock 'n' roll band. You would say {{he was the guy}} who did the band's accounting. But Max is the authoritative, buttoned-down adult <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>midst</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> this madness." [...] The drummer reveled in O'Brien's youthful audience: [...] "To be 49 and appreciated by 14-year-olds again? What a thrill!" [...] Weinberg engaged in stare-downs with O'Brien and gave scripted screeds about newsmakers. [...] Additionally, Weinberg was comically presented as a twisted character with sexual fetishes and homicidal tendencies in comedy bits. When Conan O'Brien was host of Saturday Night Live on March 10, 2001, his monologue featured a visit from the SNL studio to the Late Night studio (only a few floors apart in the same building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza), where Conan discovers Weinberg engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman on his desk (played by Max's real-life wife, Becky). [...] Weinberg says of his comic persona: [...] "t's playing against type. I've been happily married for nearly 30 years, with two wonderful children. It's not what I portray on the show, and that's funny." [...] Weinberg continued his one-man college shows, now titled [...] "E Street to Late Night: Dreams Found, Lost, and Found Again".|$|E

[...] Although Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992, she considers it unimportant, saying [...] "there's part of me that feels it wasn't even a real Emmy." [...] The award is a Creative Arts prize not awarded during the primetime telecast and, at the time, a juried award without nominations. Still, Smith considers her work on the show a success. [...] "If I had to be associated with one character in fiction," [...] she said, [...] "I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson." [...] Matt Groening has described Smith as being very similar to Lisa: [...] "Yeardley has strong moral views about her character. There are lines that are written for Lisa that Yeardley reads and says, 'No, I wouldn't say that.'" [...] Former Simpsons writer Jay Kogen praised her performance on the show, particularly in the episode [...] "Lisa's Substitute", as able [...] "to move past comedy to something really strong and serious and dramatic." ...|$|E

[...] Brandle commended the show for being [...] "all slick, clean fun". Erica Futterman (Rolling Stone) wrote in a title for the concert at the Beacon Theatre in New York, [...] "U.K. boy band relies on vocal prowess and charisma to keep fan base loyal."

Jane Stevenson (Canoe.ca) maintained that the show at the Molson Canadian Amphitheatre in Toronto had [...] "none of that choreographed dance move nonsense", and complimented the [...] "naturally, classy, low-key" [...] production. Melody Lau (National Post) {{reviewed the}} same concert.

[...] Lau additionally noted One Direction's lack of original material to perform, [...] "the group falls back on a handful of covers to fill in their set, including Kings of Leon's [...] "Use Somebody", Gym Class Heroes' [...] "Stereo Hearts" [...] and, surprisingly, Natalie Imbruglia's [...] "Torn". Not straying too far away from the originals, the mid-show medley definitely felt like the boys randomly belting out songs for the sake of filler but girls didn't mind." ...|$|E
