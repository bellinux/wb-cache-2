5000|$|Legal changes, however, {{passed in}} 1913 allowed the HMTC to {{continue}} driving the tunnel, at rates {{of up to}} 45 feet weekly, to a point beneath <b>Halkyn</b> <b>Mountain</b> by 1919. At 6am on 5 January 1917, the tunnel broke into a [...] "loch", or flooded cavern, {{at the intersection of}} the Pant Lode: 10,000 gallons of water a minute flowed into the tunnel, sweeping away trucks and seriously hampering work for some weeks. 11 hours later St Winefride's Well, where water from the <b>Halkyn</b> <b>Mountain</b> system had resurged several miles away, ran dry as the water table fell. Water was eventually restored to the well via the Holywell Boat Level.|$|R

50|$|Halkyn United Football Club {{was formed}} in 1945 in the {{aftermath}} of the Second World War and became founder members of the old <b>Halkyn</b> <b>Mountain</b> League, which was a forerunner to the Clwyd League. It is believed that during this period of the club's history the club played their home games on various grounds within the village of Pentre Halkyn.

50|$|The Milwr Tunnel is a mine {{drainage}} adit running some 10 {{miles from}} the hamlet of Cadole near Loggerheads, Denbighshire to Bagillt on the Dee Estuary in North Wales. It was originally built to drain the lead mines beneath <b>Halkyn</b> <b>Mountain,</b> which were plagued with flooding in their lower levels, but enabled the exploitation of new lodes and was variously used for the extraction of lead, zinc and limestone during its working history. It {{is part of a}} network of mines, lodes and natural cave systems - the Halkyn United Mines - that extends for up to 100 kilometres, the longest in the United Kingdom.|$|R
2500|$|Anglesey is a {{relatively}} low-lying island, with low hills spaced evenly over {{the north of the}} island. The highest six are: Holyhead <b>Mountain</b> (...) <b>Mynydd</b> Bodafon (...) Mynydd Llaneilian (...) Mynydd y Garn (...) Bwrdd Arthur (...) and Mynydd Llwydiarth (...) [...] To the south and south-east the island is separated from the Welsh mainland by the Menai Strait, which at its narrowest point is about [...] wide. In all other directions the island is surrounded by the Irish Sea. It is the 51st largest island in Europe.|$|R
50|$|Emboldened by {{the success}} of the initial line, the company decided to build a more ambitious line from the Llanelly Dock to pits further to the north-east. The company changed its name at this time to the Llanelly Railway and Dock Company, by Act of 21 August 1835. This second line, {{separate}} from the Dafen line, opened as far as Pontardulais in 1839, extending to Duffryn and Cwmamman on 6 May 1840. In the following two years an eastward extension to pits in the Amman Valley was opened, and in 1842 a westward branch to the Great <b>Mountain</b> (<b>Mynydd</b> Mawr) was constructed.|$|R
50|$|North Wales has a {{very diverse}} and complex geology with Precambrian schists along the Menai Strait and the great Cambrian dome behind Harlech and {{underlying}} much of western Snowdonia. In the Ordovician period much volcanism deposited a range of minerals and rocks over the north western parts of Gwynedd whilst {{to the east of}} the River Conwy lies a large area of upland rolling hills underlain by the Silurian mudstones and grits comprising the Denbigh and Migneint Moors. To the east, around Llangollen, to the north on <b>Halkyn</b> <b>Mountain</b> and the Great Orme and in eastern Anglesey are beds of limestone from which metals have been mined since pre-Roman times. Added to all this are the complexities posed by Parys Mountain and the outcrops of unusual minerals such as Jasper and Mona Marble which make the area of special interest to geologists.|$|R
50|$|Its {{headwaters}} rise on {{the southern}} and western slopes of Fan Hir at {{the eastern edge of}} the Black <b>Mountain</b> (Y <b>Mynydd</b> Du) and the river joins the River Tawe at Glyntawe after a short and steep south-eastward descent of 3 km / 2 miles.|$|R

2500|$|Less {{than a mile}} east of the {{aqueduct}} at Cefn Mawr, {{the river}} is crossed by the Cefn Mawr Viaduct, built in 1848 by Thomas Brassey and carries the Shrewsbury to Chester railway line across the Dee. Beyond this point the river forms the boundary between Wrexham County Borough in Wales and Shropshire in the West Midlands of England. Passing Chirk and the confluence with the River Ceiriog, the river begins to trace gentle meanders on the level ground {{at the beginning of}} the Cheshire Plain. The course continues past Erbistock on the Welsh side, and the 5th-century earthwork of Wat's Dyke on the English, before passing wholly into Wales at Overton bridge. A couple more miles downstream is Bangor-on-Dee, known for its Racecourse. Until 1974 this area was part of an exclave of historic Flintshire known as English Maelor (...) [...] The Dee continues to meander past Worthenbury where it is joined by the River Clywedog. At this point the border between Wrexham and Cheshire West and Chester follows the course of the river. It passes the Cheshire village of Crewe by Farndon, before cutting between Holt in Wales and Farndon in England beneath the 14th-century, GradeI listed Holt Bridge. One of the major tributaries of the Dee, the River Alyn (...) crosses the Carboniferous Limestone from <b>Halkyn</b> <b>Mountain</b> and runs down through the Loggerheads area before making its confluence north of Holt. Throughout the length of the Alyn there are numerous swallow holes and caverns and during the summer months long stretches of the river bed run dry. These caves include Ogof Hesp Alyn and Ogof Hen Ffynhonnau. A significant part of this lost flow reemerges in the Milwr Tunnel, a manmade tunnel, entering the west bank of the Dee estuary and carrying 12million imperial gallons per day (600l/s). This tunnel was originally constructed to drain metal mines in <b>Halkyn</b> <b>Mountain.</b> Once the main River Dee approaches the Cheshire border and the Carboniferous Coal Measures, it turns sharply northwards before meandering up to Chester. This long stretch of the river drops in height by only a few feet. The rich adjoining farmland has many remnants of abandoned coal workings and deep claypits used to make bricks and tiles. A number of these pits are now being used as landfill sites for domestic and commercial waste.|$|R

5000|$|The Afon Dwyfor is a {{river in}} Gwynedd, north-west Wales. It rises in Cwm Dwyfor (...) {{at the head}} of Cwm Pennant, gathers to itself {{numerous}} streams which drain the surrounding <b>mountains</b> from <b>Mynydd</b> Graig Goch in the west to Moel Hebog in the east, then flows southwest towards Dolbenmaen and out of the Snowdonia National Park.|$|R
50|$|From Ewloe, {{the road}} is {{relatively}} flat until after Northop when it climbs up onto the flanks of <b>Halkyn</b> <b>Mountain</b> range, passing to the southwest of Holywell with major climbs between Northop and Halkyn (Junctions 33 and 32b) and Halkyn and Holywell Summit (Junctions 32 and 31). This section of road is notorious for poor weather conditions including fog, ice and snow in winter months. In fine weather, however there are extensive views over the River Dee estuary to the Wirral Peninsula, Liverpool and beyond. The highest part of {{the road is}} {{in the vicinity of}} Brynford at around 790 feet (240 m). The steep descent towards St Asaph is down the new Rhuallt Hill (Junctions 29 to 28), which also provides the first views of the mountains of Snowdonia in the far distance. There is a crawler lane on Rhuallt Hill for eastbound traffic. The road bypasses St Asaph to the north, and runs past Bodelwyddan and Abergele to reach the North Wales coast at Pensarn (Junction 23A). From here onwards to Bangor, the route is close to the North Wales Coast railway.|$|R
50|$|The Nant Gwys is a river flowing off the Black <b>Mountain</b> (Y <b>Mynydd</b> Du) in Powys, Wales.
