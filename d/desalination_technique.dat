Although membrane distillation (MD) is a well-known technology for desalination and water treatment, it is not yet applied in industry. Membrane distillation differs from other membrane technologies in that the driving force for desalination is the difference in vapor pressure of water across the membrane, rather than total pressure. The membranes for MD are microporous and hydrophobic, which allows water vapor (but not liquid water) to pass. The vapor pressure gradient is created by heating the source water, thereby elevating its vapor pressure. The major energy requirement of MD is low-grade thermal energy. It is expected that the total costs for water purification with membrane distillation will be lower than $ 0. 50 /m 3, even as low as $ 0. 26 /m 3, depending on the source of the thermal energy required for the evaporation of water across the membrane.

40|$|Novel {{energy-efficient}} desalination techniques, such as capacitive deionization (CDI), are a {{key element}} {{for the future of}} the fresh water supply, which is increasingly under stress due to the ever-growing world population and ongoing climate changes. CDI is a <b>desalination</b> <b>technique</b> where salt ions are removed from a flow channel by the application of an electrical potential difference across this channel and are stored in electrical double layers. The aim of this work is to visualize and explain the charging process of CDI using a new microfluidic approach. Namely, we implement the geometry of CDI on a chip and visualize the ion distributions in the channel using fluorescence microscopy. In contrast to normal CDI, our system was operated in the absence of flow, using non-porous electrodes. By using two pH-sensitive fluorescence dyes, we found the formation of pH waves across the channel, even though the system is operated at low potential differences in order to suppress Faradaic reactions, such as water splitting. From simulations of the transport process, we found that a small current density in the order of 0. 1 A m- 2 can trigger the formation of such pH waves. CDI generally benefits from large electrode areas relative to the channel cross section. However, this large area ratio will also increase the magnitude of these waves, which might lead to a reduction in desalination efficiency...|$|E

The present thesis describes fundamental contributions to the thermal design of HDH systems that have made them affordable (< 5 $/m³). These contributions include: (1) the development of thermal design algorithms for thermodynamic balancing via mass extractions and injections; (2) design of a bubble column dehumidifier for high heat and mass transfer rates even {{in the presence of}} a large percentage of non-condensable gas; and (3) optimization of system design with pressure as a parameter. Definition of a novel non-dimensional parameter known as the 'modified heat capacity rate ratio' (HCR) has enabled designs that minimize the imbalance in local driving temperature and concentration differences. The design algorithm has been validated by experimental data from a pilot-scale HDH unit constructed as part of the thesis work. The energy consumption of HDH was reduced by 55 % by this technique. Bubble column (BC) heat exchangers can have high heat and mass transfer rates by condensing the vapor-gas mixture in a column of liquid rather than on a cold surface. New physical understanding of heat transfer in BCs has led to low pressure drop designs (< 1 kPa) and the concept of multistaging the uniform temperature column in several temperature steps has led to high effectiveness designs (about 90 %). A prototype with an order of magnitude higher heat rate compared to existing dehumidifiers operating in the film condensation regime was developed to validate the physical models. Overall cost of water production in HDH can be further reduced by treating pressure as a variable parameter. Systems operating under varied pressure consume half the energy as existing HDH systems. by Prakash Narayan Govindan. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Only 10 million of 1400 million cubic meters {{of water on the}} planet is of low salinity which is suitable for use after applying conventional water treatment techniques. The growing demand and an increasing depletion of fresh water have necessitated development of various technologies to tap this resource.

However, these techniques are extremely expensive. Hence small scale portable desalination systems providing high throughput while utilizing minimum power are highly desirable.

A simple microfluidic device was designed and used for separating two synthetic dyes (fluorescein and umbelliferone) with an electric field of 51 V/cm depending on their electrophoretic charges. The separated ions were distinguished based on their fluorescence emission band. Power consumed by a single unit was measured in the range of 1. 78 - 2. 3 mW at a flow rate of 10 L/min. Due to its low power consumption and membrane-less approach, in future, this process can be compared to several other established <b>desalination</b> <b>techniques...</b>|$|R

This thesis investigates the technical problems associated with large-scale stand-alone wind powered desalination employing a short-term energy store, particularly the complexities associated with the intermittent operation of the desalination plant. To achieve this, a non-linear, time domain system model of an existing wind powered desalination plant has been developed using the propriety code Simulink. Two <b>desalination</b> <b>techniques</b> have been considered: reverse osmosis and electrodialysis, due firstly to their relatively low specific energy consumption, and secondly, their efficient coupling to a wind turbine generator. As a way of reducing power mismatch, optimising water production, and above all reducing the switching rates of the desalination units, operation of the reverse osmosis and electrodialysis units under variable power conditions is suggested. Little information is available on plant performance under such conditions. A mathematical model has therefore been developed to ascertain the performance of reverse osmosis and electrodialysis processes under transient power conditions. The model consists of the set of partial differential equations (PDEs) describing the conservation of mass, momentum and chemical species coupled with the appropriate boundary conditions. A numerical solution based on the finite volume method has been employed to solve for the system of PDEs, as no analytical solution is available for the particular set of model equations derived. Sensitivity of plant performance to key design parameters (such as operating pressure and energy storage capacity) and operational strategies is predicted from simulation results. This technology is economically attractive for islands where wind energy density is high and water resources are scarce...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Water {{desalination}} {{is receiving}} increasing attention due to water scarcity {{in many places}} in the world. Although two third of the earth is covered with water, most of this water is salty (97. 5 %) and therefore not suitable for human, animal or plant needs. Furthermore, most of the fresh water available throughout the work is not accessible such as icebergs and some deep ground water. Water uneven distribution throughout the world creates another problem of water scarcities in arid places. Africa and Middle East are having the smallest share of natural, pure water resources. Fortunately, these areas of arid climate and low fresh water are rich in the most significant renewable energy source, solar energy. In this chapter, {{the potential of the}} utilization of renewable energy sources is discussed. Several <b>desalination</b> <b>techniques</b> that can be powered by renewable energy are discussed. Those techniques include the non-conventional ones such as the solar stills, humidification dehumidification desalination and membrane distillation. What is common within all of these techniques is the relatively low temperatures needed to operate the plants (around 80 C) that can be afforded easily using solar collectors for heating water (and sometimes air). Several layouts of humidification dehumidification systems and membrane distillation system are also discussed in details taking into consideration the improvement of performance due to energy recovery systems and the recent trends of such technologies. Although the solar energy is basically free source of energy, how good this energy is utilized in operating the desalination systems is considered in the gain output ratio (GOR) that allows for comparison of different systems comparison and shows the room for improvement...|$|R
