25|$|Air entraining agents add and entrain tiny {{air bubbles}} in the concrete, which reduces damage during {{freeze-thaw}} cycles, increasing durability. However, <b>entrained</b> <b>air</b> entails a trade off with strength, as each 1% of air may decrease compressive strength 5%. If too much air becomes {{trapped in the}} concrete {{as a result of}} the mixing process, Defoamers can be used to encourage the air bubble to agglomerate, rise to the surface of the wet concrete and then disperse.|$|E
25|$|Jameson’s {{research}} {{showed that}} the kinetics of flotation of fine particles was a strong function of the bubble diameter and {{that the way to}} improve recoveries was to use small bubbles in the order of 300µm in diameter. What was needed was a practical method of making such bubbles in large quantities, of the order of billions per second. The device needed to be simple to construct and operate, capable of running for long periods with minimal maintenance, and should be resistant to blockage by stray large particles in the feed. He began to look at the theory of bubble breakup in sheared flows, that is, in flow fields in which layers of liquid slide over each other. Lewis and Davidson had recently published a theory to predict the maximum size of bubbles in a well-characterised flow environment. By balancing the forces acting on a bubble in a shearing flow, including the disruptive dynamic stresses from the liquid motion and the restoring force of surface tension, it was possible to predict the critical shear rate required to produce a bubble of given size. Jameson then looked for simple and practical ways of generating the required shear rates, and found inspiration in the kitchen sink. If a jet of water from a tap plunges into a basin full of water, a shear layer develops around the jet, that entrains air from the atmosphere into the water, and at the same time, breaks up the <b>entrained</b> <b>air</b> into fine bubbles. The effect is magnified if there is a detergent in the water. Detergents, known as frothers, are used in flotation to prevent bubble coalescence, and to create stable froths. By the correct choice of jet velocity and diameter, it is possible to provide a controlled shear environment that can generate bubbles of a suitable size for flotation, with the added advantage that the air is naturally aspirated by the jet, so {{there is no need for}} a compressor or blower. Thus the idea of the Jameson Cell was born.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Air {{entrainment}} in {{high pressure}} piezoelectric injector for {{gasoline direct injection}} is studied by mean of Fluorescent Particle Image Velocimetry. A combination of PIV data filtering is proposed as {{an efficient way to}} eradicate dubious vectors remaining inside the dense spray due to Mie scattering by the liquid phase. Analyses are performed on mean average velocity flow fields obtained with long time injection duration and various ambient pressures up to 15 bar. The vessel being limited at 12 bar maximum relative pressure, a dense gas CF 4 is used to simulate higher pressure. Density effect on <b>air</b> <b>entrained</b> by the spray is analyzed leading to the distinction between the air entrainment region and the vortex one. A direct method for <b>air</b> <b>entrained</b> mass flow rate is used, enabled by the availability of velocity vectors very close to the spray edge. Density effect on air entrainment in quasi steady region is analyzed leading again to the differentiation of a near zone and a far one. Whereas spray better entrains air for high ambient density, a common trend is observed. In the near field, the cumulative <b>air</b> <b>entrained</b> mass flow rate follows a 3 / 2 -power law whereas, in the far field, a linear dependence of entrained mass flow rate as a function of axial distance is found. Then, an integral model for full cone spray is used to compare experimental results. As good agreement was found, a physical analysis is proposed to better appreciate the model's prediction of <b>air</b> <b>entrained</b> in the quasi-steady region. Further works are still in progress to study the interaction of the unsteady vortex with the surrounding gas. 1...|$|R

It has been found that the modern anionic AEAs from the group of alkyl sulfates are much more efficient and active than traditional ones i. e. sodium abietate. It is difficult to entrain air into mortars with cement of various types to the same content of air. This requires to carry out a number of tests to determine the appropriate amounts of AEA. The air entrainment of LP cement mortar does not significantly change its flow. The air entrainment of BSF and FA cement mortars increases their workability. The lowest content of air was stated in non-air-entrained mortars with FA cement, the highest air content was observed in BFS cement mortars.

The mineralogical changes of hardened cement paste, the chloride absorption, the changes of the specific electrical resistance and the watertightness were studied to complete the usual mechanical properties tests (strength, Young’s modulus, etc.).

40|$|The most {{prevalent}} method {{for the prevention}} of freeze-thaw and salt scaling damage in cement based materials is through the entrainment of air voids using air entraining chemical admixtures (AEA's). However, the common field methods for measuring air content in fresh concrete cannot distinguish between <b>entrained</b> and entrapped <b>air</b> voids, and the actual air content in the hardened concrete can vary from that determined by these tests due to a variety of factors such as workability, placing operations, consolidation efforts, and environmental conditions. Previous research has shown the ability of ultrasonic attenuation to distinguish between <b>entrained</b> and entrapped <b>air</b> voids in hardened cement paste, providing a foundation for an inversion procedure to calculate the size and volume content of the two scatterer sizes. While additional challenges are present with measurements in fresh paste, the use of an immersion setup can overcome the limitations of cement paste containment vessels and provide a means to measure air content from batching to placement. An immersion apparatus to monitor ultrasonic wave attributes including attenuation in fresh cement paste is designed and built. Results comparing <b>air</b> <b>entrained</b> and non-air entrained cement pastes are presented. Ultrasonic wave attributes are studied as a function of time and level of chemical air entrainer. Finally, recommendations are made to improve the accuracy of the immersion apparatus in order to develop an in situ, quality control procedure to quantify the air content of fresh cement paste from batching to placement.

40|$|While {{there has}} {{been a great deal of}} {{research}} on air entrainment at hydraulic jumps within closed conduits, very little of the research has specifically addressed size and temperature scale effects. Influences from jump location and changing length characteristics on air entrainment have also received little attention from past research. To determine the significance of size-scale effects of <b>air</b> <b>entrained</b> by hydraulic jumps in closed conduits, air flow measurements were taken in four different-sized circular pipe models with similar Froude numbers. Each of the pipe models sloped downward and created identical flow conditions that differed only in size. Additionally, specific measurements were taken in one of the pipe models with various water temperatures to identify any effects from changing fluid properties. To determine the significance of the effects of changed length characteristics on air demand, air flow measurements were taken with hydraulic jumps at multiple locations within a circular pipe with two different air release configurations at the end of the pipe. Results showed that air demand was not affected by the size of the model. All together, the data from four different pipe models show that size-scale effects of <b>air</b> <b>entrained</b> into hydraulic jumps within closed conduits are negligible. However, it was determined that air entrainment was significantly affected by the water temperature. Water at higher temperatures <b>entrained</b> much less <b>air</b> than water at lower temperatures. Hydraulic jump location results showed that for both configurations the percentage of air entrainment significantly increased as the hydraulic jump occurred near the point of air release downstream. As the jump occurred nearer to the end of the pipe, its length characteristics were shortened and air demand increased. However, jump location was only a significant factor until the jump occurred some distance upstream where the length characteristics were not affected. Upstream of this location the air demand was dependent only on the Froude number immediately upstream of the jump...|$|R
