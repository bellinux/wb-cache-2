25|$|His lechery was {{so strong}} that it broke out {{even in the midst of}} rather hectic circumstances. While {{accompanying}} Thomas Kavanaugh on his daring escape from Lucknow, <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quick rattle with a local prostitute, and during the battle of Patusan, he found himself galloping one of Sharif Sahib's concubines without even realizing it but nonetheless continued to the climax of the battle and the tryst.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> contradiction, but {{she nodded}} her head in agreement.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, and his calmness was {{restored}} to him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, Monsieur Rigaud,' said <b>he,</b> <b>pausing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment at}} the grate, with his keys in his hands, 'have the {{goodness}} to come out.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> answer. Cranly {{dislodged}} a figseed {{from his}} teeth {{on the point}} of his rude toothpick and gazed at it intently.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> answer; but Darsie, overawed by {{the energy}} of his manner, and unwilling to commit himself by a hasty explanation, {{remained}} silent.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. Every word he was {{compelled}} to measure.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> reply, {{but nobody}} had any {{information}} to impart.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment with}} his hand upon the {{fastening}} of the door.|$|E
6000|$|Here <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant, and {{concealed}} {{his face}} behind his pocket-handkerchief. Then, smiling faintly, {{and holding the}} bed furniture with one hand, he resumed: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have,' {{said the}} dismal man hurriedly; 'I have. More {{than those who}} see me now would believe possible.' <b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant, and then said abruptly-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I will go," [...] said <b>he.</b> Then <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> answer, {{but none}} came. [...] "And you will {{understand}} what I meant when I spoke of being turned out." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few moments, and {{the scout}} gravely {{waited for him}} to resume.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, set the {{machinery}} working again, and delivered five {{more at the}} pithead.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment; he let {{his head}} droop on his breast, then {{suddenly}} raised it again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't care a {{damn about}} all that." [...] <b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant and then spoke in a low, hoarse whisper. [...] "I don't want to leave you! I can't leave you." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> answer; and, {{receiving}} none, observed Magdalen more attentively than he {{had observed}} her yet. Her face had turned deadly pale again; her eyes looked out mechanically straight before her in heedless, reckless despair.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{see about}} it, Dick Rover," [...] snarled Dan Baxter. <b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant. [...] "He laughs best who laughs last," [...] he muttered, and strode off {{as fast as}} his long legs would carry him, in the {{direction}} of the lake.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, {{and then}} {{suddenly}} continued. His voice had broken. He spoke in quick nervous sentences.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while, and, hearing no dissent, {{walked down}} the hall and out of the door.|$|E
60|$|Ramsden thought Philip {{hard and}} cold. <b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment or two, looking {{about him in}} a perplexed way.|$|E
6000|$|... "There must be no quarreling here," [...] {{said the}} landlord. [...] "The {{law does not}} allow it." [...] <b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant. [...] "I will show you gentlemen to your rooms." [...] He turned to the burgomaster of Masolga. [...] "Your fire shall be {{attended}} to immediately." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If we {{were going}} alone I'd feel tiptop," [...] Joe said, as <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant in his work; [...] "but as it is, I'm afraid we'll have trouble with that crowd before the United States coast heaves in sight, {{even if they do}} talk so fair just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sire! the Von der Tanns {{have always}} been loyal {{to the house of}} Rubinroth. And but a single thing rises {{superior}} within their breasts to that loyalty, and that is their loyalty to Lutha." [...] <b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant before concluding. [...] "And I, sire, am a Von der Tann." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. A flush dyed his worn face, and {{his voice}} was {{strained}} when he went on again.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, {{and then}} his voice became hoarse as he {{indicated}} the clustering men with a little forceful gesture.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> softer word {{than the}} one that had risen to his lips, and she took it away from him.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>he</b> then <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> reply, she {{was obliged}} to say something.|$|R
60|$|They {{thought then}} that he had finished. <b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> unusually long time. When he spoke again {{he seemed to have}} wholly regained his usual composure. The note of passion had passed from his tone. His cheeks were once more of waxen pallor. The deliberately-chosen words fell with a chill sarcasm from his lips.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> answer: {{and what}} was I to say? Oh, for some good spirit to suggest a judicious and {{satisfactory}} response! Vain aspiration! The west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their song, however sweet, was inarticulate.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, while I {{asked him}} if he could {{remember}} the nature of the country through which he had journeyed.|$|E
60|$|They {{crossed the}} road and turned into St. James's Park. <b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment {{to look at the}} front of Buckingham Palace.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few minutes, threw {{from him}} his helmet, then strode down the hill, {{and took the}} road to King Richard's pavilion.|$|E
60|$|He had {{hopes that}} as he went he might have come across a cavalry patrol {{and sent them to}} Marsden and Ottewells to bring up aid; but the road was quiet and deserted. Once or twice <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant, {{thinking}} <b>he</b> heard the sound of distant musketry. He held his breath, but no sound could he hear save the heavy thumping of his own heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never! When I declare that, I expect my word to be respected," [...] <b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> answer, {{but what}} could she say? She did not at all respect his word on such a subject, but she did respect his conduct. [...] "Yes; I call upon you to believe me when I say that for me all that is over. But it can be nothing to you." ...|$|R
60|$|Even {{as these}} {{thoughts}} passed {{through his mind}} some noise of the stalker in his rear must {{have come to the}} buck, <b>for</b> with <b>a</b> sudden start <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant, trembling, in his tracks, and then with a swift bound dashed straight for the river and Tarzan. It was his intention to flee through the shallow ford and escape upon {{the opposite side of the}} river.|$|R
