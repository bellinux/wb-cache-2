5|$|For {{people with}} relapsed AML, the only proven {{potentially}} curative therapy is a {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplant, <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> not already been performed. In 2000, the monoclonal antibody-linked cytotoxic agent gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) was approved in the United States for people aged more than 60 years with relapsed AML who are not candidates for high-dose chemotherapy. This drug was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer, Pfizer in 2010.|$|E
5|$|E.V. Ramasamy also {{blamed the}} capitalists for their control of machineries, {{creating}} difficulties for the workers. According to his philosophy, rationalism, {{which has to}} lead the way for peaceful life to all, had resulted in causing poverty and worries to the people because of dominating forces. He stated that there is no use of simply acquiring titles or amassing wealth <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> no self-respect or scientific knowledge. An example he gave was the West sending messages to the planets, while the Tamil society in India were sending rice and cereals to their dead forefathers through the Brahmins.|$|E
5|$|Ethan Siegel, who {{is deeply}} {{skeptical of the}} {{existence}} of an undiscovered new planet in the Solar System, nevertheless speculates that at least one super-Earth, which have been commonly discovered in other planetary systems but have not been discovered in the Solar System, might have been ejected from the Solar System during a dynamical instability in the early Solar System. Hal Levison thinks that the chance of an ejected object ending up in the inner Oort cloud is only about 2%, and speculates that many objects must have been thrown past the Oort cloud <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> entered a stable orbit.|$|E

Often, the most ludicrous scenes occur, and the most comical complaints are made.|$|R

5|$|Maier {{writes that}} the novel {{includes}} themes of love, with Hidjo's love for Woengoe, Betje, and Biroe paralleling that of Walter's love for Roos, Woengoe, and Betje. He also notes {{that there is a}} theme of social mobility, where Hidjo's relationships with noble women are fostered by his merchant father to grant the family a greater social position; bride prices also feature prominently, showing that one can become a noble through marriage <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> enough money. He notes that, {{towards the end of the}} novel, love is described as something only those with a Dutch education would attempt to find, as the social-financial meaning of marriage remains predominant among the traditional Javanese. The characters, despite not all marrying for love, are happy with their eventual partners and have a comfortable life.|$|E
5|$|The {{thesis of}} eliminativism {{seems to be}} so {{obviously}} wrong to many critics, under the claim that people know immediately and indubitably that they have minds, that argumentation seems unnecessary. This sort of intuition pumping is illustrated by asking what happens when one asks oneself honestly <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> mental states. Eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position by claiming that intuitions often are mistaken. Analogies {{from the history of}} science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation: it may appear obvious that the sun travels around the earth, for example, but for all its apparent obviousness this conception was proved wrong nevertheless. Similarly, it may appear obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions. Nevertheless, this could equally turn out to be false.|$|E

50|$|When {{users were}} first {{able to access}} the Turntable beta, {{the only way to}} log in was by using one's Facebook credentials, and only <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> another Facebook friend who was already a Turntable user. Chasen {{announced}} that as of September 23, 2011, the site dropped the requirement of needing a Facebook friend already on Turntable in order to use it. <b>If</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> Facebook friends online on Turntable {{at the same time they}} were, it would show what room they are in, in order to facilitate connections between users.|$|R

25|$|In addition, damaged oviducts {{increase}} the risk of ectopic pregnancy. Thus, <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> had salpingitis, the risk of a pregnancy to become ectopic is 7 to 10-fold as large. Half of ectopic pregnancies are due to a salpingitis infection.|$|E

25|$|Calculating the {{arithmetic}} {{mean of the}} errors diminishes the contribution of any single large deviation.

25|$|Because {{there are}} so many {{different}} dance programs from which to choose, dancers have many options as to how far up the dance levels they want to advance.

25|$|It is {{considered}} a greater sin to advertise one's fasting than to {{not participate in the}} fast. Fasting is a purely personal communication between the Orthodox Christian and God, and in fact has no place whatsoever in the public life of the Coptic Orthodox Church. <b>If</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> responsibilities that cannot be fulfilled because of fasting, then it is perfectly permissible not to fast.|$|E
25|$|Various Vajrayana {{practices}} {{involve the}} recognition of this aspect of mind in different situations, such as during sleep. In this case, the practitioner trains to consciously enter the deep sleep state. <b>If</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> the ability to remain conscious during deep sleep, one {{will be able to}} recognize the luminosity of death and gain Buddhahood. This is called the meeting of mother and child luminosities, resulting in the state of thuktam at death.|$|E
25|$|The {{theological}} {{basis for}} forgiveness in Hinduism {{is that a}} person who does not forgive carries a baggage of memories of the wrong, of negative feelings, of anger and unresolved emotions that affect his or her present as well as future. In Hinduism, not only should one forgive others, but one must also seek forgiveness <b>if</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> wronged someone else. Forgiveness is to be sought from the individual wronged, as well as society at large, by acts of charity, purification, fasting, rituals and meditative introspection.|$|E
