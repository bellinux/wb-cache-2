40|$|Abstract. The {{distribution}} of subpopulations of lymphocytes in lymph nodes and tumors from cattle with <b>enzootic</b> <b>bovine</b> leukosis (EBL) was examined by immunohistochemistry using {{a panel of}} monclonal antibodies against leukocyte differentiation molecules of EBL. The lesions in lymph nodes could be divided into three types based {{on the extent of}} infiltration and proliferation of neoplastic cells with provirus and differential expression of leukocyte differentiation molecules. The number of B-B 2 +, sIgM+ cells was reduced in frequency in follicles during the neoplastic cell proliferation. CD 4 - and CD 8 -positive a/ @ T cells and y/ 6 T cells positive for WC 1 (workshop cluster designation) were also reduced in frequency in areas infiltrated with neoplastic cells. Almost all neoplastic cells were B-B 2 - and IgM-positive. However, there were a few B-B 2 - and/or IgM-negative cells or cells stained faintly in all cases. WCI + cells were not observed in tumor tissues. However, CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells were observed throughout tumor tissues, suggesting a role for these cells in tumor immunity.

Of these, 24 (17. 1 %) reacted positively, 21 (15. 0 %) were suspect and 95 (67. 9 %) were negative. In 1993, of the 122 samples tested 25 (20. 5 %) were positive, 8 (6. 6 %) were suspect and 89 (72. 9 %) were negative.

A differentiation observed between the population numbers of CD 19 + B lymphocytes and CD 2 + T lymphocytes as well as the CD 8 + T lymphocyte sub-population was found to be significant between cows with different genotypes of AcP. Moreover, a correlation was found between the polymorphism of AcP and EBL incidence in cows with reference to the number and percentage of CD 19 + B lymphocytes (AcP polymorphism x EBL interaction).

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of Swiss surveillance for epizootic diseases, dairy cattle are sampled using bulk tank milk while non-dairy cattle are sampled on the farm. The latter method is costly, time-demanding and dangerous for the personnel. However, slaughterhouses could be an alternative sampling point for this population. To assess the cost-effectiveness and sensitivity of such an approach, surveillance using slaughterhouse sampling was modelled with data from the 2012 Swiss animal movement database (AMD). We simulated a cross-sectional study for bluetongue (BT), and surveillance programmes to substantiate freedom from infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and <b>enzootic</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>leucosis</b> (EBL) (combined) to compare the outcome of random on-farm sampling versus slaughterhouse sampling. We found that, under Swiss conditions, slaughterhouse sampling results in low herd-level sensitivities because animals are sent by owners to slaughter individually and not in large groups, restricting the number of samples per herd. This makes slaughterhouse sampling inappropriate for prevalence surveys at the herd-level. However, for prevalence surveys at the animal-level and for substantiation of freedom from disease, slaughterhouse surveillance is equally or more cost-efficient than on-farm sampling...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{cohort study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the risk of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) transmission to uninfected cattle by adjacent infected cattle in 6 dairy farms. Animals were initially tested in 2010 – 2011 using a commercial ELISA kit. Uninfected cattle were repeatedly tested every 4 to 6 months until fall of 2012. The Cox proportional hazard model with frailty showed that uninfected cattle neighboring to infected cattle (n= 53) had a significant higher risk of seroconversion than those without any infected neighbors (n= 81) (hazard ratio: 12. 4, P= 0. 001), implying that neighboring infected cattle were a significant risk factor for BLV transmission. This finding provides scientific support for animal health authorities and farmers to segregate infected cattle on farms to prevent spread of BLV.
