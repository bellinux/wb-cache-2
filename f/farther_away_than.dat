5|$|Because The Assayer {{contains}} such {{a wealth}} of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it {{has been referred to}} as his scientific manifesto. Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618, which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth, and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon, it must be <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> <b>than</b> the moon.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Mars is eccentric, its {{apparent}} magnitude at opposition from the Sun can range from −3.0 to −1.4. The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.6 when the planet is {{in conjunction with the}} Sun. Mars usually appears distinctly yellow, orange, or red; the actual color of Mars is closer to butterscotch, and the redness seen is just dust in the planet's atmosphere. NASA's Spirit rover has taken pictures of a greenish-brown, mud-colored landscape with blue-grey rocks and patches of light red sand. When farthest away from Earth, it is more than seven times <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> <b>than</b> when it is closest. When least favorably positioned, it can be lost in the Sun's glare for months at a time. At its most favorable times—at 15- or 17-year intervals, and always between late July and late September—a lot of surface detail can be seen with a telescope. Especially noticeable, even at low magnification, are the polar ice caps.|$|E
5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form in {{a worldwide}} band of thunderstorm activity near the equator, {{referred to as}} the Intertropical Front (ITF), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), or the monsoon trough. Another important source of atmospheric instability is found in tropical waves, which {{contribute to the development of}} about 85% of intense tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific. The majority forms between 10 and 30 degrees of latitude away of the equator, and 87% forms no <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> <b>than</b> 20 degrees north or south. Because the Coriolis effect initiates and maintains their rotation, tropical cyclones rarely form or move within 5degrees of the equator, where the effect is weakest. However, it is still possible for tropical systems to form within this boundary as Tropical Storm Vamei and Cyclone Agni did in 2001 and 2004, respectively.|$|E

25|$|NASA has {{described}} JWST as the scientific {{successor to the}} Hubble Space Telescope, but not a replacement, because the capabilities are not identical.

The result was to extend the life of Hubble until JWST, as the next generation telescope, could go online.

25|$|In 1953, the Battle Creek team {{became the}} Muskegon Lassies, {{and by the}} end of the season, it too, folded. Faut came back for her final year in the AAGPBL. Her team was {{weakened}} considerably by the player losses at the end of the previous season, and Faut was worn down from all the dissension. South Bend would finish the season second from last, compiling a 45–65 record. In spite of everything that had gone wrong, Faut still turned to post a 17–11 record and produced a league-best 1.51 ERA in 29 games, though league offensive levels were increasing. By her final season, only overhand pitching was allowed, the ball was a lively cork-centered ten inches, and the basepaths were seventy-five feet. More importantly from a pitching perspective, the pitching rubber was moved back to fifty-six feet, thirteen feet <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> <b>than</b> in 1946. At the same time, fences were moved in to allow for more home runs.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the five ships that sank, fourteen were judged to have serious damage or worse, mostly due to the bomb's air-pressure shock wave. All but three were located within [...] of the detonation. Inside that radius, orientation to the bomb {{was a factor in}} shock wave impact. For example, ship #6, the destroyer , which sank, was <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> <b>than</b> seven ships that stayed afloat. Lamson was broadside to the blast, taking the full impact on her port side, while the seven closer ships were anchored with their sterns toward the blast, somewhat protecting the most vulnerable part of the hull.|$|E

50|$|Observers at {{high latitudes}} (but less than 70.4°) {{will see a}} noticeably smaller angular {{diameter}} for Phobos because they are considerably <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> from it <b>than</b> observers at Mars's equator. As a result, transits of Phobos for such observers will cover less of the Sun's disk. Because it orbits so close to Mars, Phobos cannot be seen north of 70.4°N or south of 70.4°S; observers at such latitudes will obviously not see transits, either.|$|R
500|$|Aristarchus thus {{believed}} the stars {{to be very}} far away, and saw this as the reason why stellar parallax had not been observed, that is, the stars had not been observed to move relative each other as the Earth moved around the Sun. The stars are in fact much <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> <b>than</b> the distance that was generally assumed in ancient times, which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with precision instruments. The geocentric model, consistent with planetary parallax, {{was assumed to be}} an explanation for the unobservability of the parallel phenomenon, stellar parallax. The rejection of the heliocentric view was apparently quite strong, as the following passage from Plutarch suggests (On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon): ...|$|E
500|$|The {{main cause}} of less-than-expected ship damage was that the bomb missed its aim point by [...] The ship the bomb was aimed at failed to sink.

The bombsight was checked and found error free. Pumpkin bomb drops were conducted, but were accurate. Colonel Paul W. Tibbets believed that the miss {{was caused by a}} miscalculation by the crew. The mystery was never solved. There were other factors that made Able less spectacular than expected.

50|$|Sometimes {{it is hard}} to {{tell the}} {{difference}} between fringing reefs and another type of reef called a barrier reef.

Another major difference is that barrier reefs tend to be much <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> from shore <b>than</b> fringing reefs.|$|R

2500|$|Adherence to the geocentric model stemmed {{largely from}} several {{important}} observations. First of all, if the Earth did move, then one {{ought to be}} able to observe the shifting of the fixed stars due to stellar parallax. In short, if the Earth was moving, the shapes of the constellations should change considerably over the course of a year. [...] If they did not appear to move, the stars are either much <b>farther</b> <b>away</b> <b>than</b> the Sun and the planets than previously conceived, making their motion undetectable, or in reality they are not moving at all. [...] Because the stars were actually much further away than Greek astronomers postulated (making movement extremely subtle), stellar parallax was not detected until the 19th century. Therefore, the Greeks chose the simpler of the two explanations. The lack of any observable parallax was considered a fatal flaw in any non-geocentric theory. Another observation used in favor of the geocentric model at the time was the apparent consistency of Venus' luminosity, which implies that it is usually about the same distance from Earth, which in turn is more consistent with geocentrism than heliocentrism. In reality, that is because the loss of light caused by Venus' phases compensates for the increase in apparent size caused by its varying distance from Earth. Objectors to heliocentrism noted that terrestrial bodies naturally tend to come to rest as near as possible to the center of the Earth. [...] Further barring the opportunity to fall closer the center, terrestrial bodies tend not to move unless forced by an outside object, or transformed to a different element by heat or moisture.|$|E
