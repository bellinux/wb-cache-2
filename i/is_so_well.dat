5|$|It is a {{particularly}} poignant melody that should play with an audience's emotions. The mistress clearly {{knew what she was}} doing sleeping with an older man, and yet there is something expletive about it as well. Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E

25|$|A {{company profile}} from 1886: Daniel Pabst, Designer and Manufacturer of Artistic Furniture, No. 269 South Fifth Street—One {{of the leading}} and most {{successful}} designers and manufacturers of artistic furniture in Philadelphia is Mr. Daniel Pabst, whose office and manufactory are located at No. 269 South Fifth Street. The business was established in 1854 by Pabst & Krauss, who were pioneers in the trade here. About 16 years ago Mr. Pabst became sole proprietor. The premises are very spacious, admirably arranged, and equipped throughout with every facility and convenience for the transaction of business, employment being given to 25 skilled workmen. Mr. Pabst designs and manufactures art and antique furniture of all kinds, which, for beauty and originality of design, superior and elaborate finish are unexcelled. The trade of the house extends through this and adjacent States. It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> known and has retained its old customers for so long a time, that its reputation for honorable, straightforward dealing is established beyond the requirements of praise.|$|E

Everybody's very involved with that. And it constantly gets played with. What I love about Game of Thrones is that the positioning of the music <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> done, because it's not overdone. When the music cuts in, it really has something to say."

A number of prominent scholars have attempted to bring the Zhuangzi to wider attention among Western readers. [...] In 1939, the British translator and Sinologist Arthur Waley described the Zhuangzi as [...] "one of the most entertaining {{as well as one}} of the profoundest books in the world." [...] In the introduction to his 1994 translation of the Zhuangzi, the American Sinologist Victor H.

We did a month, and then the day before the cameras turned on, we would go through the moves a couple of times so we wouldn't hurt each other. There were a few times we clipped each other.

500|$|The Falcons {{missed the}} playoffs the {{following}} season {{and would not}} return until 2002. Following the 2001 season, Chandler was released by the team, and Jamal Anderson retired due to a knee injury. The franchise would not reach Super Bowl again until the 2016 season, when they lost in overtime to the New England Patriots, 34–28. As a result, their win in the 1998 NFC Championship game stood as the franchise's proudest moment for years. Anthony Hammett of Bleacher Report [...] believes that the team <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> remembered because of the pessimism that surrounded the franchise at the time, and an NFL Films retrospective on the Falcons' season noted that [...] "years of pain were wiped away in one unforgettable afternoon." [...] Dan Weiner stated that, [...] "The 1998 season was {{a dream come true}} [...] For once, the Atlanta Falcons made believers of us all." [...] In 2010, ESPN named the 1998 team as the greatest Falcons team of all-time, and the network also voted Morton Andersen's game-winning field goal as the top play in Falcons' history.|$|E
500|$|The Moving Picture News and The Moving Picture World {{were both}} neutral in their {{review of the}} film, giving neither {{specific}} praise nor criticism of the production.

She insists on her lover rigging himself up in knightly costume and carrying her off on a horse to be married. The absurdity of this business in modern times is not made as much of as might have been, but it brings plenty of laughter. The actress who played the part of the girl marred her work by turning too often to face the camera. She is very pretty and attractive but she should not permit it to appear that she <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> aware of her beauty."

500|$|Reviews of {{the film}} were mostly positive, but there was some {{confusion}} of critics which {{did not know how}} to respond to the film. Some critics took it for a historical film instead of a historical fiction. The New York Dramatic Mirror was one such outlet, which stated that they could not verify the authenticity of the story, but found the picture was excellent and artistic. Ever the one to highlight technical faults, the Mirror highlighted the original paintings error in the use of the flag as well as the film's omission of snow. The Morning Telegraph understood the historical fiction being presented and praised the production though they also highlighted technical issues in the splitting of the troops on the landing and the poor pulling of a prop cannon. The Billboard praised the film's acting and photography, but did not specifically refer to whether the film was fictional when it stated, [...] "An incident from history at the period of the Revolution is the makeup of this picture." [...] Some of the highest praise was given by the reviewer of The Moving Picture World which stated, [...] "The story <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> told that the audience is held almost spellbound in places as the reel moves through the changing scenes. It is admirably done, staging, acting and photography combining to make an exceptionally attractive picture of this patriotic subject." ...|$|E
500|$|Whales are {{creatures of}} the open ocean; they feed, mate, give birth, suckle and raise their young at sea. So extreme is their {{adaptation}} to life underwater that {{they are unable to}} survive on land. Whales range in size from the [...] and [...] dwarf sperm whale to the [...] and [...] blue whale, which is the largest creature that has ever lived. The sperm whale is the largest toothed predator on earth. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. Baleen whales have no teeth; instead they have plates of baleen, a fringe-like structure used to expel water while retaining the krill and plankton which they feed on. They use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in huge gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Toothed whales, on the other hand, have conical teeth designed for catching fish or squid. Baleen whales have a well developed sense of [...] "smell", whereas toothed whales have well-developed hearing − their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species, such as sperm whales, are well adapted for diving to great depths to catch squid and other favoured prey.|$|E
500|$|Poppy's {{introduction}} to EastEnders in what Jody Thompson of the Daily Mail described as [...] "a bizarre and utterly irrelevant chat" [...] was criticised by Daniella Graham of the Metro, {{who said that}} [...] "viewers were left questioning why on earth anyone thought this pointless sub-plot was necessary". In contrast, The Press and Journal Derek Lord deemed Poppy to have been [...] "a welcome addition to the show"; he wrote that, [...] "as a double act, [...] no Morecambe and Wise, {{but at least they}} bring an element of something approaching humour to the otherwise soul-destroying drabness of the London soap". Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror labelled Poppy the [...] "Optimist of the week" [...] for her line [...] "I bet it's really nice here when they ain't having a funeral", and [...] "Delicate flower of the week" [...] for her [...] "That <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> tragic innit?"
