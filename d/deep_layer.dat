5|$|Tropical Storm Octave was {{considered}} the worst tropical cyclone {{in the history of}} Arizona. The origins of Tropical Storm Octave were from a tropical disturbance that formed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on September23, 1983. Steered by a <b>deep</b> <b>layer</b> high over Mexico, the disturbance moved west for four days before becoming a tropical depression on September27 off the southwest coast of Mexico. Over an area of warm sea surface temperatures, it was able to quickly strengthen to peak winds of 50mph (85km/h), through wind shear prevented much further development. By September30, Octave was accelerating to the northeast, steadily weakening due to cooler waters. That day it weakened to tropical depression status, and on October2, Octave dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Bob {{originated}} from {{the remnants of}} a frontal trough to the southeast of Bermuda on August12. The system tracked towards the southwest and later west towards the Bahamas. By August15th, satellite analysis of the system found a weak low pressure area a couple hundred miles east of the Bahamas. Operationally, the system was not declared a tropical depression until 0600UTC on August16 after a reconnaissance mission into the storm found a closed circulation and flight level winds of 37mph (60km/h). After post-storm analysis, it was determined that the low had developed into a depression around 0000UTC. Several hours after being designated, the system began to develop convective banding features. Roughly 18hours after being declared a depression, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded it to a tropical storm, giving it the name Bob. At this time, Bob was situated roughly 140mi (225km) northeast of Nassau, Bahamas. The storm tracked slowly towards the northwest in response to the <b>deep</b> <b>layer</b> mean flow it was embedded within.|$|E
5|$|Saturn's {{interior}} is probably {{composed of a}} core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). This core {{is surrounded by a}} <b>deep</b> <b>layer</b> of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach , higher than on Jupiter, but not as high as those on Neptune.|$|E

40|$|Attention to a {{stimulus}} enhances both neuronal responses and gamma frequency synchrony in visual area V 4, {{both of which}} should increase the impact of attended information on downstream neurons. To determine whether gamma synchrony is common throughout the ventral stream, we recorded from neurons in the superficial and <b>deep</b> <b>layers</b> of V 1, V 2, and V 4 in two rhesus monkeys. We found an unexpected striking difference in gamma synchrony in the superficial vs. <b>deep</b> <b>layers.</b> In all three areas, spike-field coherence in the gamma (40 – 60 Hz) frequency range was largely confined to the superficial <b>layers,</b> whereas the <b>deep</b> <b>layers</b> showed maximal coherence at low frequencies (6 – 16 Hz), which included the alpha range. In the superficial layers of V 2 and V 4, gamma synchrony was enhanced by attention, whereas in the <b>deep</b> <b>layers,</b> alpha synchrony was reduced by attention. Unlike these major differences in synchrony, attentional effects on firing rates and noise correlation did not differ substantially between the superficial and <b>deep</b> <b>layers.</b> The results suggest that synchrony plays very different roles in feedback and feedforward projections.

5|$|Before Eline struck Mozambique, storm {{warnings}} and later hurricane warnings were issued on February21. Flooding had affected the nation since January, with some areas receiving a year's worth of rainfall in two weeks. Widespread areas were inundated, with about 220,000people displaced, and about 150people killed. Eline moved ashore with very powerful winds, {{although there were}} no direct observations of the strongest winds. In Beira, the closest major city to the landfall point, winds reached storm force. However, the rainfall from Eline was the most impacting following the preexisting flooding, which were the worst since 1951.

25|$|Human VF are paired {{structures}} {{located in}} the larynx, just above the trachea, which vibrate and are brought in contact during phonation. The human VF are roughly 12 – 24mm in length, and 3–5mm thick. Histologically, the human VF are a laminated structure composed of five different layers. The vocalis muscle, {{main body of the}} VF, is covered by the mucosa, which consists of the epithelium and the lamina propria. The latter is a pliable layer of connective tissue subdivided into three layers: the superficial layer (SLP), the intermediate layer (ILP), and the <b>deep</b> <b>layer</b> (DLP). Layer distinction is either made looking at differential in cell content or extracellular matrix (ECM) content. The most common way being to look at the ECM content. The SLP has fewer elastic and collagenous fibers than the two other layers, and thus is looser and more pliable. The ILP is mostly composed of elastic fibers, while the DLP has fewer elastic fibers, and more collagenous fibers. In those two layers, which form {{what is known as the}} vocalis ligament, the elastic and collagenous fibers are densely packed as bundles that run almost parallel to the edge of the vocal fold.|$|E
25|$|In the United States and a {{few other}} countries, Doppler capable weather radar {{stations}} are used. These devices are capable of measuring the radial velocity, including radial direction (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160nbsp&km) away. A supercell is characterized by a mesocyclone, which is usually first observed in velocity data as a tight, cyclonic structure in the middle levels of the thunderstorm. If it meets certain requirements of strength, duration, and vorticity, it may trip the mesocyclone detection algorithm (MDA). Tornadic signatures are indicated by a cyclonic inbound-outbound velocity couplet, where strong winds flowing in one direction and strong winds flowing in the opposite direction are occurring in very close proximity. The algorithm for this is the tornadic vortex signature (TVS) or the tornado detection algorithm (TDA). TVS is then an extremely strong mesocyclone found at very low level and extending over a <b>deep</b> <b>layer</b> of the thunderstorm, not the actual tornadic circulation. The TVS is, however, indicative of a likely tornado or an incipient tornado. The couplet and TVS typically precede tornado formation by 10–30 minutes but may occur at nearly the same time or precede the tornado by 45 minutes or more. Polarimetric radar can discern meteorological and nonmeteorological and other characteristics of hydrometeors that are helpful to tornado detection and nowcasting. Nonmeteorological reflectors co-located with a couplet, can confirm that a tornado has likely occurred and lofted debris. An area of high reflectivity, or debris ball, may also be visible {{on the end of the}} hook. Either the polarimetric data or debris ball are formally known as the tornado debris signature (TDS). The hook echo feature is formed as the RFD occludes precipitation around the mesocyclone and is also indicative of a probable tornado (tornadogenesis usually ensues shortly after the RFD reaches the surface).|$|E
