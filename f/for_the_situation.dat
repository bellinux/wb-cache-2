5|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in the film was how to bring V to life from under an expressionless mask. Thus, considerable {{effort was made to}} bring together lighting, acting, and Weaving's voice to create the proper mood <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> Since the mask muffled Weaving's voice, his entire dialogue was re-recorded in post-production.|$|E
5|$|Authorities rapidly {{ruled out}} the {{possibility}} that ETA had a cell in the island, with police believing the attack had been carried out by a unit that had travelled to the island specifically to carry it out. Initial reports stated that the bombers had set the bomb off with a remote control. Once the second bomb was spotted, police announced that it had a timer device, which could have allowed the members of ETA to plant the bomb several days before the attack and leave the island. Earlier, Government delegate for Majorca, Ramon Socías, had said that security forces believed that the bombers had not left Majorca, and were hiding on the island, waiting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> to cool down before attempting to leave.|$|E
5|$|In {{figure at}} left, the various {{segments}} {{that form the}} epitope {{have been shown to}} be continuously collinear, meaning that they have been shown as sequential; however, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> being discussed here (i.e., the antigen recognition by the B cell), this explanation is too simplistic. Such epitopes are known as sequential or linear epitopes, as all the amino acids on them are in the same sequence (line). This mode of recognition is possible only when the peptide is small (about six to eight amino acids long), and is employed by the T cells (T lymphocytes).|$|E

5|$|J.E.B. Stuart {{deprived}} Lee of cavalry intelligence {{during a}} good part of the campaign by taking his three best brigades on a path away from the army's. This arguably led to Lee's surprise at Hooker's vigorous pursuit; the meeting engagement on July 1 that escalated into the full battle prematurely; and it also prevented Lee from understanding the full disposition of the enemy on July 2. The disagreements regarding Stuart's culpability <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> originate in the relatively vague orders issued by Lee, but most modern historians agree that both generals were responsible to some extent for the failure of the cavalry's mission early in the campaign.|$|E
5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It {{is worth noting that}} it is not Hare's intention to divide up the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> Such a person would not need a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick and easy to use.|$|E

30|$|Music choices <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> were {{characterized}} along two dimensions, namely arousing and aesthetic. When considering how music choices <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> are characterized, <b>the</b> arousing and aesthetic dimensions highlight {{the differences in}} the preferred music in various <b>situations.</b> <b>The</b> arousing dimension suggests that preferred music was characterized in part on the basis of arousal goals. Specifically, because the pattern of results showed that high arousal situations were associated with music rated as highly arousing (and low arousal situations were associated with preferred music that was significantly less arousing), it demonstrates that listeners are using arousal-optimization strategies, rather than necessarily using arousal-moderation strategies. Moreover the evidence from the BPM analysis reiterates the same pattern of preferring music with a higher BPM rate (equated to more arousing music) in high arousal situations and slower music (lower BPM/less arousing music) in low arousal situations. Participants were apparently choosing music to polarize their degree of arousal to a level that is consistent with the goals of <b>the</b> listening <b>situation,</b> rather than attempting to moderate their level of arousal.|$|R
