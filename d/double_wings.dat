25|$|When Alex George {{published}} his revision of Dryandra in 1996, he recognised that D.bipinatifida possessed {{a number of}} very distinctive characters, especially in its fruiting structure. These include unusually large follicles and seeds; seeds that are set within the seed wings rather than along the base or one side; and unusual <b>double</b> <b>wings</b> that are attached to each side of the seed. In addition, the species has extremely long involucral bracts, and floral bracts that enlarge more than any other species. Recognising the need for this species to be placed in its own subgenus, George resurrected Diplophragma, promoting it to subgenus rank as D.subg. Diplophragma.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} had an oval cross-section and {{was made}} of welded steel tubes, covered with fabric. The <b>double</b> <b>wings</b> provided very high lift, even at low speeds. Both wings had the same span and an 8° sweep. Construction consisted of a double pine wing spar structure, with lime tree ribs, and fabric covering. There were ailerons in both {{the upper and lower}} wings. The tail had a conventional design, with the horizontal stabilizers mounted on the fuselage upper edge. The rudder was placed behind the elevators. Both the rudder and the elevators were of steel tube covered in fabric, and had a bigger surface than the first version to correct balance problems. The steel tube undercarriage was attached to the fuselage in a [...] "V" [...] shape and used high-pressure rubber suspension.|$|E
50|$|The <b>double</b> <b>wing</b> (also: aviator wing) {{is part of}} the {{mounting}} loop to any uniform of the Luftwaffe. It is woven in the color of all other emblems (in most cases: black (image b.) - or gold-colored by general grads (image c.)). The <b>double</b> <b>wing,</b> also part of other elements on aviator´s uniform, serves as unmistakable discrimination feature to the stone-grey/ olive-colored mounting strap to the uniform of the Heer. <b>Double</b> <b>wing</b> mounting loops are longer and wider than other one`s. The <b>double</b> <b>wing</b> is even part of the otherwise empty mounting loop to the lowest private OR1-rank (de: Flieger; see image a.), in order to distinguish between the Air Force - and Army personnel in tarnfleck uniform.|$|R

6000|$|If aught from fearful dreams may be divined, [...] They signify a cock of {{dunghill}} kind. [...] All dreams, as in old Galen I have read, [...] 140 [...] Are from repletion and complexion bred; [...] From rising fumes of indigested food, [...] And noxious humours that infect the blood: [...] And sure, my lord, if I {{can read}} aright, [...] These foolish fancies {{you have had}} to-night [...] Are certain symptoms (in the canting style) [...] Of boiling choler, and abounding bile; [...] This yellow gall, that in your stomach floats, [...] Engenders all these visionary thoughts. [...] When choler overflows, then dreams are bred [...] 150 [...] Of flames, and all the family of red; [...] Red dragons, and red beasts, in sleep we view, [...] For humours are distinguish'd by their hue. [...] From hence we dream of wars and warlike things, [...] And wasps and hornets with their <b>double</b> <b>wings.</b> [...] Choler adust congeals our blood with fear, [...] Then black bulls toss us, and black devils tear. [...] In sanguine airy dreams, aloft we bound; [...] With rheums oppress'd, we sink in rivers drown'd. [...] More I could say, but thus conclude my theme, [...] 160 [...] The dominating humour makes the dream. [...] Cato was in his time accounted wise, [...] And he condemns them all for empty lies. [...] Take my advice, and when we fly to ground, [...] With laxatives preserve your body sound, [...] And purge the peccant humours that abound. [...] I should be loath to lay you on a bier; [...] And though there lives no pothecary near, [...] I dare for once prescribe for your disease, [...] And save long bills, and a damn'd doctor's fees. [...] 170 [...] Two sovereign herbs, which I by practice know, [...] And both at hand (for in our yard they grow), [...] On peril of my soul shall rid you wholly [...] Of yellow choler, and of melancholy: [...] You must both purge, and vomit; but obey, [...] And {{for the love of}} heaven make no delay. [...] Since hot and dry in your complexion join, [...] Beware the sun when in a vernal sign; [...] For when he mounts exalted in the Ram, [...] If then he finds your body in a flame, [...] 180 [...] Replete with choler, I dare lay a groat, [...] A tertian ague is at least your lot. [...] Perhaps a fever (which the gods forefend!) [...] May bring your youth to some untimely end: [...] And therefore, sir, as you desire to live, [...] A day or two before your laxative, [...] Take just three worms, nor under nor above, [...] Because the gods unequal numbers love, [...] These digestives prepare you for your purge; [...] Of fumetory, centaury, and spurge, [...] 190 [...] And of ground ivy add a leaf or two,-- [...] All which within our yard or garden grow. [...] Eat these, and be, my lord, of better cheer; [...] Your father's son was never born to fear.|$|E

50|$|Only {{religious}} {{works are}} included in his small surviving corpus, the most famous being the Isenheim Altarpiece, completed 1515, now in the Musée d'Unterlinden, Colmar. Its nine images on twelve panels are arranged on <b>double</b> <b>wings</b> to present three views (rather than just the open and closed states of triptych altarpieces), according to the season or occasion. The first view with the outer wings closed shows a Crucifixion flanked by Saint Sebastien and Saint Anthony, with a predella showing the entombment. When {{the first set of}} wings is opened, the Annunciation, Angelic Concert (sometimes interpreted as the Birth of Ecclesia) Mary bathing Christ, and Resurrection are displayed. The third view discloses a carved and gilded wood altarpiece by Nikolaus Hagenauer, flanked by the Temptation of St. Anthony and Anthony's visit to Saint Paul. As well as being by far his greatest surviving work, the altarpiece contains most of his surviving painting by surface area, being 2.65 metres high and over 5 metres wide at its fullest extent.|$|E
50|$|The {{series is}} about a fairy called Felicity Wishes and her friends Holly, Polly and Daisy and later on winnie. Felicity lives in a fictional town called Little Blossoming. Little Blossoming, Bloomfield is in Fairy World. Fairy World {{is much the same}} as the human world with several key exceptions: there is no age, birth or death (fairies live forever), no men, no meat-eating, no money, no evil and no crime. Most of the books are set pre-graduation where Felicity goes to the School of Nine Wishes to learn and she eats cake and drinks tea with her friends at Sparkles Cafe. She has also {{travelled}} all over Fairy World. In these books Felicity Wishes and her friends both have a single pair of wings, because they still go to school; fairies who have graduated get <b>double</b> <b>wings.</b> Felicity has a constant companion, a little blue bird called Bertie Dishes, the only male character in the whole book series.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Productivity {{simulation}} of multiple-fractured horizontal wells {{is the core}} technique during optimizing fracture’s amount and parameters. According to the dissymmetric <b>double</b> <b>wings</b> of multiple fractured high productivity horizontal gas well which is equality discreted, applying the theory of point source, the formula of unsteady seepage of gas and the principle of superposition, this paper deduce the model of overall pressure drop in formation considering the mutual interference of multi fracture. Besides, considering the high velocity non-Darcy’s flow’s effect to the fracture productivity in high horizontal gas well, establishing a more sophisticated new model to stimulate the fracture productivity in horizontal gas well. Via stimulation calculating and comparative analysing the high velocity non-Darcy’s flow, the dissymmetry of the <b>double</b> <b>wings</b> fracture, the length of fracture and the conductivity’s effect on the multiple fracture gas well’s productivity. This offers a more accurate method to optimizing the fracture’s amount in landscape and the parameters of fracture in high productivity gas well and making sure the proper production’s differential pressure...|$|E

40|$|To {{identify}} planform characteristics {{which could}} have promise for a highly maneuverable vehicle, an investigation to determine the low-speed longitudinal aerodynamics of 21 planform geometries was conducted in the Langley Subsonic Basic Research Tunnel (SBRT). Concepts that were studied included twin bodies, <b>double</b> <b>wings,</b> cutout wings, and serrated forebodies. The planform models that were tested were all 1 / 4 -in. -thick flat plates with beveled edges on the lower surfaces. A 1. 0 -in. -diameter cylindrical body with a hemispherical nose was used to house the six-component strain gauge balance on each configuration. Aerodynamic force and moment data were obtained over an angle-of-attack range of 0 ° to 70 ° with zero sideslip at a free-stream dynamic pressure of 30 psf, which corresponds to a freestrea...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{potential flow}} in an unbounded domain with two parallel plates is considered. We examine whether two free point vortices can be trapped near the two plates {{in the presence}} of a uniform flow and observe if these stationary point vortices enhance the force on the plates. The present study is an extension of the work by Saffman & Sheffield (1977), in which a free point vortex over a single plate is investigated. The flow problem is motivated by an airfoil design problem for the <b>double</b> <b>wings.</b> Moreover, it also contributes to a design problem for an efficient wind turbine with vertical blades. In order to obtain the point-vortex equilibria numerically, we make use of a linear algebraic algorithm combined with a stochastic process, called the Brownian ratchet scheme. The ratchet scheme allows us to capture a family of stationary point vortices in multiply connected domains with ease. As a result, we find that stationary point vortices exist around the two plates and they enhance the downward force and the counter-clockwise rotational force acting on the two plates...|$|E
