60|$|But if {{the last}} glacial epoch has coincided with, {{and has been}} to a {{considerable}} extent caused by, a high <b>excentricity</b> of the earth's orbit, we are naturally led to expect that earlier glacial epochs would have occurred whenever the <b>excentricity</b> was unusually large. Dr. Croll has published tables showing the varying amounts of <b>excentricity</b> for three million years back; and from these it appears {{that there have been}} many periods of high <b>excentricity,</b> which has often been far greater than {{at the time of the}} last glacial epoch.[10] The accompanying diagram has been drawn from these tables, and it will be seen that the highest <b>excentricity</b> occurred 850,000 years ago, at which time the difference between the sun's distance at aphelion and perihelion was thirteen and a half millions of miles, whereas during the last glacial period the maximum difference was ten and a half million miles.|$|E
60|$|But {{if every}} period of high <b>excentricity</b> {{produced}} a glacial epoch of greater or less extent and severity, then, {{on account of}} the frequent occurrence of a high phase of <b>excentricity</b> during the three million years for which we have the tables, these boulder and rock-strewn deposits would be both numerous and extensive. Four hundred thousand years ago the <b>excentricity</b> was almost exactly the same as it is now, and it continually increased from that time up to the glacial epoch. Now if we take double the present <b>excentricity</b> as being sufficient to produce some glaciation in the temperate zone, we find (by drawing out the diagram at p. 171 on a larger scale) that during 1,150,000 years out of the 2,400,000 years immediately preceding the last glacial epoch, the <b>excentricity</b> reached or exceeded this amount, consisting of sixteen separate epochs, divided from each other by periods varying from 30,000 to 200,000 years. But if the last glacial epoch was at its maximum 200,000 years ago, a space of three million years will certainly include much, if not all, of the Tertiary period; and even if it does not, {{we have no reason to}} suppose that the character of the <b>excentricity</b> would suddenly change beyond the three million years.|$|E
60|$|Another {{estimate}} is {{afforded by the}} date of the last glacial epoch if coincident with the last period of high <b>excentricity,</b> while the Alpine glaciation of the Miocene period is assumed to have been caused by the next earlier phase of very high <b>excentricity.</b> Taking these as data, the {539} proportionate change of the species of mollusca affords a means of arriving at the whole lapse of time represented by the fossiliferous rocks; and these two estimates agree in the order of their magnitudes.|$|E

60|$|But this is {{the very}} least amount of change of climate that would {{certainly}} occur every 10,500 years when there was a high <b>excentricity,</b> for it is impossible to doubt that a varying distance of the sun in summer from 86 to 99 millions of miles (which is what occurred during--as supposed--the Miocene period, 850,000 years ago) would produce an important difference in the summer temperature and in the actinic influence of sunshine on vegetation. For the intensity of the sun's rays would vary as the square of the distance, or nearly as 74 to 98, so that the earth would be actually receiving one-fourth less sun-heat during summer at one time than at the other. An equally high <b>excentricity</b> occurred 2,500,000 years back, and no doubt was often reached during still earlier epochs, while a lower but still very high <b>excentricity</b> has frequently prevailed, and is probably near its average value. Changes of climate, therefore, every 10,500 years, of the character above indicated and of varying intensity, have been the rule rather than the exception in past time; and these changes must have been variously modified by changing geographical conditions so as to produce climatic alterations in different directions, giving to the ancient lands either dry or wet seasons, storms or calms, equable or excessive temperatures, in a variety of combinations of which the earth perhaps affords no example under the present low phase of {121} <b>excentricity</b> and consequent slight inequality of sun-heat.|$|E
60|$|It is then {{argued that}} the changes of climate every 10,500 years during the {{numerous}} periods of high <b>excentricity</b> have acted as a motive power in hastening on both geological and biological change. By raising and lowering the snow-line in all mountain ranges it has caused increased denudation; while the same changes have caused much migration and disturbance in the organic world, and have thus tended to the more rapid modification of species. The present epoch being a period of very low <b>excentricity,</b> the earth is in a phase of exceptional stability both physical and organic; and it is from this period of exceptional stability that our notions of the very slow rate of change have been derived.|$|E
60|$|Effect of High <b>Excentricity</b> on the Warm Polar Climates.--If the {{explanation}} of {{the cause of the}} glacial epoch given in the last chapter is a correct one, it will, I believe, follow that changes in the amount of <b>excentricity</b> will produce no important alteration of the climates of the temperate and Arctic zones so long as favourable geographical conditions, such as have been now sketched out, render the accumulation of ice impossible. The effect of a high <b>excentricity</b> in producing a glacial epoch was shown to be due to the capacity of snow and ice for storing up cold, and its singular power (when in large masses) of preserving itself unmelted under a hot sun by itself causing the interposition of a protective covering of cloud and vapour. But mobile currents of water have no such power of {88} accumulating and storing up heat or cold from one year to another, though they do in a pre-eminent degree possess the power of equalising the temperature of winter and summer and of conveying the superabundant heat of the tropics to ameliorate the rigour of the Arctic winters. However great was the difference between the amount of heat received from the sun in winter and summer in the Arctic zone during a period of high <b>excentricity</b> and winter in aphelion, the inequality would be greatly diminished by the free ingress of warm currents to the polar area; and if this was sufficient to prevent any accumulation of ice, the summers would be warmed to {{the full extent of the}} powers of the sun during the long polar day, which is such as to give the pole at midsummer actually more heat during the twenty-four hours than the equator receives during its day of twelve hours. The only difference, then, that would be directly produced by the changes of <b>excentricity</b> and precession would be, that the summers would be at one period almost tropical, at the other of a more mild and uniform temperate character; while the winters would be at one time somewhat longer and colder, but never, probably, more severe than they are now in the west of Scotland.|$|E

The results have shown that the convergence is not too sensitive to the irregularities of the discretising network, to the <b>excentricities</b> of the internal circle, etc., but it substantially depends on the ratio of the lift and the radius of the circle. The iteration becomes divergent if the geometrical data of the boundaries specify an optimum shape that has vertical touching lines.

60|$|This was {{observed}} first by Roemer, {{and then by}} others, {{by means of the}} Eclipses of the Satellites of Jupiter. For these Eclipses, when the Earth is between the Sun and Jupiter, happen about seven or eight Minutes sooner than they ought to do by the Tables, and when the Earth is beyond the Sun they happen about seven or eight Minutes later than they ought to do; the reason being, that the Light of the Satellites has farther to go in the latter case than in the former by the Diameter of the Earth's Orbit. Some inequalities of time may arise from the <b>Excentricities</b> of the Orbs of the Satellites; but those cannot answer in all the Satellites, and at all times to the Position and Distance of the Earth from the Sun. The mean motions of Jupiter's Satellites is also swifter in his descent from his Aphelium to his Perihelium, than in his ascent in the other half of his Orb. But this inequality has no respect to the position of the Earth, and in the three interior Satellites is insensible, as I find by computation from the Theory of their Gravity.|$|R

60|$|No doubt a {{prejudice}} {{has been}} excited against {{it in the}} minds of many geologists, by its being thought to lead necessarily to frequently recurring glacial epochs throughout all geological time. But I have here endeavoured to show that this is not a necessary consequence of the theory, because a concurrence of favourable geographical conditions is essential to the initiation of a glaciation, which when once initiated has a tendency to maintain itself throughout the varying phases of precession occurring during a period of high <b>excentricity.</b> When, however, geographical conditions favour warm Arctic climates--as it has been shown they have done throughout the larger portion of geological time--then changes of <b>excentricity,</b> to however great an extent, have no tendency to bring about a state of glaciation, because warm oceanic currents have a {98} preponderating influence, and without very large areas of high northern land to act as condensers, no perpetual snow is possible, and hence the initial process of glaciation does not occur.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{judging by}} the amount of organic and {{physical}} change that occurred during and since the glacial epoch, and that which has occurred since the Miocene period, it is considered probable that this maximum of <b>excentricity</b> coincided with some part of the latter period; and Dr. Croll maintains that a glacial epoch must then have {60} occurred surpassing in severity that of which we have such convincing proofs, and consisting like it of alternations of cold and warm phases every 10,500 years. The diagram also shows us another long-continued period of high <b>excentricity</b> from 1,750,000 to 1,950,000 years ago, and yet another almost equal to the maximum 2,500,000 years back. These may perhaps have occurred during the Eocene and Cretaceous epochs respectively, or all may have been included within the limits of the Tertiary period. As two of these high excentricities greatly exceed that which caused our glacial epoch, while the third is almost equal to it and of longer duration, they seem to afford us the means of testing rival theories of the causes of glaciation. If, as Dr. Croll argues, high <b>excentricity</b> is the great and dominating agency in bringing on glacial epochs, geographical changes being subordinate, then there must have been glacial epochs of great severity at all these three periods; while if he is also correct in supposing that the alternate phases of precession would inevitably produce glaciation in one hemisphere, and a proportionately mild and equable climate in the opposite hemisphere, then we should have to look for evidence of exceptionally warm and exceptionally cold periods, occurring {61} alternately and with several repetitions, within a space of time which, geologically speaking, is very short indeed.|$|E

60|$|Date of Last Glacial Epoch and its Bearing on the Measurement of Geological Time.--Directly we go {{back from}} this stable period we come upon changes both in the forms and in the {{distribution}} of species; and when we pass beyond the last glacial epoch into the Pliocene period we find ourselves in a comparatively new world, surrounded by a considerable number of species altogether different from any which now exist, together with many others which, though still living, now inhabit distant regions. It seems not improbable that what is termed the Pliocene period, was really the coming on of the glacial epoch, and this is the opinion of Professor Jules Marcou.[49] According to our views, a considerable amount of geographical change must have occurred at the change from the Miocene to the Pliocene, favouring the refrigeration of the northern hemisphere, and leading, in the way already pointed out, to the glacial epoch whenever a high degree of <b>excentricity</b> {123} prevailed. As many reasons combine to make us fix the height of the glacial epoch at the period of high <b>excentricity</b> which occurred 200,000 years back, and as the Pliocene period was probably not of long duration, we must suppose the next great phase of very high <b>excentricity</b> (850,000 years ago) to fall within the Miocene epoch. Dr. Croll believes that this must have produced a glacial period, but we have shown strong reasons for believing that, in concurrence with favourable geographical conditions, it led to uninterrupted warm climates in the temperate and northern zones. This, however, did not prevent the occurrence of local glaciation wherever other conditions led to its initiation, and the most powerful of such conditions is a great extent of high land. Now we know that the Alps acquired a considerable part of their elevation during {{the latter part of the}} Miocene period, since Miocene rocks occur at an elevation of over 6,000 feet, while Eocene beds occur at nearly 10,000 feet. But since that time there has been a vast amount of denudation, so that these rocks may have been at first raised much higher than we now find them, and thus a considerable portion of the Alps may have been more elevated than they are now. This would certainly lead to an enormous accumulation of snow, which would be increased when the <b>excentricity</b> reached a maximum, as already fully explained, and may then have caused glaciers to descend into the adjacent sea, carrying those enormous masses of rock which are buried in the Upper Miocene of the Superga in Northern Italy. An earlier epoch of great altitude in the Alps coinciding with the very high <b>excentricity</b> 2,500,000 years ago, may have caused the local glaciation of the Middle Eocene period when the enormous erratics of the Flysch conglomerate were deposited in the inland seas of Northern Switzerland, the Carpathians, and the Apennines. This is quite in harmony with the indications of an uninterrupted warm climate and rich vegetation during the very same period in the adjacent low countries, just as we find at the present day in New Zealand a delightful climate and a rich vegetation of Metrosideros, {124} fuchsias and tree-ferns on the very borders of huge glaciers, descending to within 700 feet of the sea-level. It is not pretended that these estimates of geological time have any more value than probable guesses; but it is certainly a curious coincidence that two remarkable periods of high <b>excentricity</b> should have occurred, at such periods and at such intervals apart, as very well accord with the comparative remoteness of the two deposits in which undoubted signs of ice-action have been found, and that both these are localised in the vicinity of mountains which are known to have acquired a considerable elevation at about the same period of time.|$|E
60|$|The general {{conclusion}} is thus reached, that geographical conditions are the essential causes of great changes of climate, {{and that the}} radically different distribution of land and sea in {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres has generally led to great diversity of climate in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. The form and arrangement of the continents is shown to be such as to favour the transfer of warm oceanic currents to the north far in excess of those which move towards the south, and whenever these currents had free passage through the northern land-masses to the polar area, a mild climate must have prevailed over the whole northern hemisphere. It is only in very recent times that the great northern continents have become so completely consolidated as they now are, thus shutting out the warm water from their interiors, and rendering possible a wide-spread and intense glacial epoch. But this great climatal change was actually brought about by the high <b>excentricity</b> which occurred about 200,000 years ago; and it is doubtful if a similar glaciation in equally low latitudes could be produced by means of any such geographical combinations as actually occur, without the concurrence of a high <b>excentricity.</b>|$|E
60|$|But though high <b>excentricity</b> {{would not}} {{directly}} modify the mild climates {{produced by the}} state of the northern hemisphere which prevailed during Cretaceous, Eocene, and Miocene times, it might indirectly affect it by increasing the mass of Antarctic ice, and thus increasing the force of the trade-winds and the resulting northward-flowing warm currents. Now there are many peculiarities in the distribution of plants and of some groups of animals in the southern hemisphere, which render it almost certain that there has sometimes been a greater extension of the Antarctic lands during Tertiary times; and it is therefore not improbable that a more or less glaciated condition may have been a long persistent feature of the southern hemisphere, due to the peculiar distribution of land and sea which favours the production of ice-fields and glaciers. And as we have seen that during the last three million years the <b>excentricity</b> has been almost always much higher than {89} it is now, we should expect that the quantity of ice in the southern hemisphere will usually have been greater, and will thus have tended to increase the force of those oceanic currents which produce the mild climates of the northern hemisphere.|$|E
6000|$|... [100] This view was, I believe, {{first put}} forth by myself in a paper read before the Geological Section of the British Association in 1869, and {{subsequently}} {{in an article in}} Nature, Vol. I. p. 454. It was also stated by Mr. S. B. J. Skertchley in his Physical System of the Universe, p. 363 (1878); but we both founded it on what I now consider the erroneous doctrine that actual glacial epochs recurred each 10,500 years during periods of high <b>excentricity.</b>|$|E
60|$|Present Condition of the Earth One of Exceptional Stability as Regards Climate.--It will be seen, by a {{reference}} to the diagram at page 171, that during the last three million years the <b>excentricity</b> has been less than it is now on eight occasions, for short periods only, making up a total of about 280,000 years; while it has been more than it is now for many long periods, of from 300,000 to 700,000 years each, making a total of 2,720,000 years; or nearly as 10 to 1. For nearly half the entire period, or 1,400,000 years, the <b>excentricity</b> has been nearly double what it is now, and this is not far from its mean condition. We have no reason for supposing that this long period of three million years, for which we have tables, was in any way exceptional as regards the degree or variation of excentricity; but, on the contrary, we may pretty safely assume that its variations during this time fairly represent its average state of increase and decrease during all known geological time. But when the glacial epoch ended, 72,000 years ago, the <b>excentricity</b> was about double its present amount; it then rapidly decreased till, at 60,000 years back, it was very little greater than it is now, and since then it has been uniformly small. It follows that, for about 60,000 years before our time, the mutations of climate every 10,500 years have been comparatively unimportant, and that the temperate zones have enjoyed an exceptional stability of climate. During this time those powerful causes of organic change which depend on considerable changes of climate and the consequent modifications, migrations, and extinctions of species, will not have been at work; the slight changes that did occur would probably be so slow and so little marked that the various species would be able to adapt themselves to them without much disturbance; and the result would be an epoch of exceptional stability of species.|$|E
60|$|We thus {{see that}} the last glacial epoch was the climax of a great process of {{continental}} development which {{had been going on}} throughout long geological ages; and that it was the direct consequence of the north temperate and polar land having attained a great extension and a considerable altitude just at the time when a phase of very high <b>excentricity</b> was coming on. Throughout earlier Tertiary and Secondary times an equally high <b>excentricity</b> often occurred, but it never produced a glacial epoch, because the north temperate and polar areas had less high land, and were more freely open to the influx of warm oceanic currents. But wherever great plateaux with lofty mountains occurred in the temperate zone a considerable local glaciation might be produced, which would be specially intense during periods of high excentricity; and it is to such causes we must impute the indications of ice-action {{in the vicinity of the}} Alps during the Tertiary period. The Permian glaciation appears to have been more extensive, and it is quite possible that at this remote epoch a sufficient mass of high land existed in our area and northwards towards the pole, to have brought on a true glacial period comparable with that which has so recently passed away.|$|E
60|$|This {{arrangement}} is such as {{would cause the}} northern hemisphere to be always (as it is now) warmer than the southern, and this {{would lead to the}} preponderance of northward winds and ocean currents, and would bring about the concentration of the latter in three great streams carrying warmth to the north-polar regions. These streams would, as Dr. Croll has so well shown, be greatly increased in power by the glaciation of the south polar land; and whenever any considerable portion of this land was elevated, such a condition of glaciation would certainly be brought about, and would be heightened whenever a high degree of <b>excentricity</b> prevailed.|$|E
60|$|It follows, therefore, that if {{periods of}} high <b>excentricity,</b> like that {{which appears to}} have been {{synchronous}} with our last glacial epoch and is generally admitted to have been one of its efficient causes, always produced glacial epochs (with or without alternating warm periods), then the whole of the Tertiary deposits in the north temperate and Arctic zones should exhibit frequent alternations of boulder and rock-bearing beds, or coarse rock-strewn gravels analogous to our existing glacial drift, and with some corresponding change of organic remains. Let us then see what evidence can be adduced of the existence of such deposits, and whether it is adequate to support the {67} theory of repeated glacial epochs during the Tertiary period.|$|E
60|$|Concluding Remarks.--In {{the present}} chapter I have endeavoured to show that, {{combining}} the measured rate of denudation with the estimated thickness and probable {{extent of the}} known series of sedimentary rocks, we may arrive at a rude estimate of the time occupied {{in the formation of}} those rocks. From another point of departure--that of the probable date of the Miocene period, as determined by the epoch of high <b>excentricity</b> supposed to have aided in the production of the Alpine glaciation during that period, and taking the estimate of geologists as to the proportionate amount of change in the animal world since that epoch--we obtain another estimate of the duration of geological time, which, though founded on far less secure data, agrees pretty nearly with the former estimate. The time thus arrived at is immensely less than the usual estimates of geologists, and is so far within the limits of the duration of the earth as calculated by Sir William Thomson, as to allow {{for the development of the}} lower organisms an amount of time anterior to the Cambrian period several times greater than has elapsed between that period and the present day. I have further shown that, in the continued mutations of climate produced by high <b>excentricity</b> and opposite phases of precession, even though these did not lead to glacial epochs, we have a motive power well calculated to produce far more rapid organic changes than have hitherto been thought possible; while in the enormous amount of specific variation (as demonstrated in an earlier chapter), we have ample material for that power to act upon, so as to keep the organic world in a state of rapid change and development proportioned to the comparatively rapid changes in the earth's surface.|$|E
60|$|Elevation and Depression of the Snow Line as Aiding the Migration of Plants.--We have endeavoured to show (in {{an earlier}} {{portion of this}} volume) that {{wherever}} geographical or physical conditions were such as to produce any considerable amount of perpetual snow, this would be increased whenever {{a high degree of}} <b>excentricity</b> concurred with winter in aphelion, and diminished during the opposite phase. On all mountain ranges, therefore, which reached above the snow-line, there would be a periodical increase and decrease of snow, and when there were extensive areas of plateau at about the same level, the lowering of the snow-line might cause such an increased accumulation of snow as to produce great glaciers and ice-fields, such as we have seen occurred in South Africa during the last period of high <b>excentricity.</b> But along with such depression of the line of perpetual snow there would be a corresponding depression of the alpine and sub-alpine zones suitable for the growth of an arctic and temperate vegetation, and, what is perhaps more important, the depression would necessarily produce a great extension of the area of these zones on all high mountains, because as we descend the average slopes become less abrupt,--thus affording a number of new stations suitable for such temperate plants as might first reach them. But just above and below the snow-line is the area of most powerful disintegration and denudation, from the alternate action of frost and sun, of ice and water; and thus the more extended area would be subject to the constant occurrence of land-slips, berg-falls, and floods, with their {517} accompanying accumulations of débris and of alluvial soil, affording innumerable stations in which solitary wind-borne seeds might germinate and temporarily establish themselves.|$|E
60|$|This {{lowering}} {{and rising}} of the snow-line each 10,500 years {{during periods of}} high <b>excentricity,</b> would occur in {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres alternately; and where there were high mountains within the tropics the two would probably overlap each other, so that the northern depression would make itself felt in a slight degree even across the equator some way into the southern hemisphere, and vice versâ; and even if the difference of the height of perpetual snow at the two extremes did not average more than a few hundred feet, this would be amply sufficient to supply the new and unoccupied stations needful to facilitate the migration of plants. It is well known that all great mountain ranges have undergone such fluctuations, as proved by ice-marks below the present level of snow and ice.|$|E
60|$|Temperate Climates in the Arctic Regions.--As we {{have just}} seen, the {{geological}} evidence of the persistence of sub-tropical or warm climates in the north temperate zone during {{the greater part of}} the Tertiary period is almost irresistible, and we have now to consider the still more extraordinary series of observations which demonstrate that this amelioration of climate extended into the Arctic zone, and into countries now almost wholly buried in snow and ice. These warm Arctic climates have been explained by Dr. Croll as due to periods of high <b>excentricity</b> with winter in perihelion, a theory which implies alternating {71} epochs of glaciation far exceeding what now prevails; and it is therefore necessary to examine the evidence pretty closely in order to see if this view is more tenable {{in the case of the}} north polar regions than we have found it to be in that of the north temperate zone.|$|E

60|$|The {{frequent}} {{recurrence of}} periods {{of high and}} of low <b>excentricity</b> must certainly have produced changes of climate of considerable importance {{to the life of}} animals and plants. During periods of high <b>excentricity</b> with summer in perihelion, that season would be certainly very much hotter, while the winters would be longer and colder than at present; and although geographical conditions might prevent any permanent increase of snow and ice even in the extreme north, yet we cannot doubt that the whole northern hemisphere would then have a very different climate than when the changing phase of precession brought a very cool summer and a very mild winter--a perpetual spring, in fact. Now, such a change of climate would certainly be calculated to bring about a considerable change of species, both by modification and migration, without any such decided change of type either in the vegetation or the animals that we could say from their fossil remains that any change of climate had taken place. Let us suppose, for instance, that the climate of England and that of Canada were to be mutually exchanged, and that the change took five or six thousand years to bring about, it cannot be doubted that considerable modifications in the fauna and flora of both countries would be the result, although it is impossible to predict {120} what the precise changes would be. We can safely say, however, that some species would stand the change better than others, while it is highly probable that some would be actually benefited by it, and that others would be injured. But the benefited would certainly increase, and the injured decrease, in consequence, and thus a series of changes would be initiated that might lead to most important results. Again, we are sure that some species would become modified in adaptation to the change of climate more readily than others, and these modified species would therefore increase {{at the expense of others}} not so readily modified; and hence would arise on the one hand extinction of species, and on the other the production of new forms.|$|E
60|$|Estimate of the {{comparative}} effects of Geographical and Astronomical Causes in producing Changes of Climate.--It appears then, that while geographical and physical causes alone, by {{their influence on}} ocean currents, have been the main agents in producing the mild climates which for such long periods prevailed in the Arctic regions, the concurrence of astronomical causes--high <b>excentricity</b> with winter in aphelion--was necessary {{to the production of}} the great glacial epoch. If we reject this latter agency, we shall be obliged to imagine a concurrence of geographical changes at a very recent period of which we have no evidence. We must suppose, for example, that {{a large part of the}} British Isles--Scotland, Ireland, and Wales at all events--were simultaneously elevated so as to bring extensive areas above the line of perpetual snow; that {97} about the same time Scandinavia, the Alps, and the Pyrenees received a similar increase of altitude; and that, almost simultaneously, Eastern North America, the Sierra Nevada of California, the Caucasus, Lebanon, the southern mountains of Spain, the Atlas range, and the Himalayas, were each some thousands of feet higher than they are now; for all these mountains present us with indications of a recent extension of their glaciers, in superficial phenomena so similar to those which occur in our own country and in Western Europe, that we cannot suppose them to belong to a different epoch. Such a supposition is rendered more difficult by the general concurrence of scientific testimony to a partial submergence during the glacial epoch, not only in all parts of Britain, but in North America, Scandinavia, and, as shown by the wide extension of the drift, in Northern Europe; and when to this we add the difficulty of understanding how any probable addition to the altitude of our islands could have brought about the extreme amount of glaciation which they certainly underwent, and when, further, we know that a phase of very high <b>excentricity</b> did occur at a period which is generally admitted to agree well with physical evidence of the time elapsed since the cold passed away, there seems no sufficient reason why such an agency should be ignored.|$|E

6000|$|... [59] The recent {{extensive}} glaciation of New Zealand {{is generally}} imputed {{by the local}} geologists to a greater elevation of the land; but I cannot help believing that the high phase of <b>excentricity</b> which caused our own glacial epoch was at all events an assisting cause. This is rendered more probable if taken {{in connection with the}} following very definite statement of glacial markings in South Africa. Captain Aylward in his Transvaal of To-day (p. 171) says:--"It will be interesting to geologists and others to learn that the entire country, from the summits of the Quathlamba to the junction of the Vaal and Orange rivers, shows marks of having been swept over, and that at no very distant period, by vast masses of ice from east to west. The striations are plainly visible, scarring the older rocks, and marking the hill-sides--getting lower and lower and less visible as, descending from the mountains, the kopjies (small hills) stand wider apart; but wherever the hills narrow towards each other, again showing how the vast ice-fields were checked, thrown up, and raised against their Eastern extremities." ...|$|E
60|$|Boulder-beds {{also occur}} in the Carboniferous formation, both in Scotland, on the {{continent}} of Europe, and in North America; and Professor Dawson considers that he has detected true glacial deposits {{of the same age}} in Nova Scotia. Boulder-beds also {{occur in the}} Silurian rocks of Scotland and North America, and according to Professor Dawson, even in the Huronian, older than our Cambrian. None of these indications are however so satisfactory as those of Permian age, where we have the very kind of evidence we looked for in vain throughout the whole of the Tertiary and Secondary periods. Its presence in several localities in such ancient rocks as the Permian is not only most important as indicating a glacial epoch of some kind in Palæozoic times, but confirms us in the validity of our conclusion, that the total absence of any such evidence throughout the Tertiary and Secondary epochs demonstrates the absence of recurring glacial epochs in the northern hemisphere, notwithstanding the frequent recurrence of periods of high <b>excentricity.</b>|$|E
60|$|In {{the tenth}} {{edition of the}} Principles of Geology, Sir Charles Lyell, taking the amount {{of change in the}} species of mollusca as a guide, {{estimated}} the time elapsed since the commencement of the Miocene as one-third that of the whole Tertiary epoch, and the latter at one-fourth that of geological time since the Cambrian period. Professor Dana, on the other hand, estimates the Tertiary as only one-fifteenth of the Mesozoic and Palæozoic combined. On the estimate above given, founded on the dates of phases of high <b>excentricity,</b> we shall arrive at about four million years for the Tertiary epoch, and sixteen million years for the time elapsed since the Cambrian, according to Lyell, or sixty millions according to Dana. The estimate arrived at from the rate of denudation and deposition (twenty-eight million years) is nearly midway between these, and it is, at all events, satisfactory that the various measures result in figures of the same order of magnitude, which is all one can expect when discussing so difficult and exceedingly speculative a subject.|$|E
