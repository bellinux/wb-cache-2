It also had a smaller bombload and shorter range. Its only major advantage would be its ability to use high speed in areas without missile cover, especially on the long journey from the USA to USSR. The value was limited; the USAF's doctrine stressed that the primary reason for maintaining the bomber force in an era of ICBMs was that the bombers could remain in the air at long ranges from their bases and were thus immune to sneak attack. In this case, the higher speed would be used for only {{a short period of time}} between the staging areas and the Soviet coastline.|$|E

We propose a methodology {{to solve the problem}} of non-invasively mapping the fluence in optically heterogeneous medium without the need of prior knowledge of its optical properties. We present a theoretical model of our concept and provide proof of principle with Monte Carlo simulations. Simulation results show that it is possible to measure the local light fluence in highly scattering medium in absolute terms. Furthermore, we performed an experiment to validate the concept as a strategy to measure local fluence <b>in</b> <b>relative</b> manners. We used reflection mode acousto optics (AO) in our experiment, and showed that with this method we can measure local light fluence (<b>in</b> <b>relative</b> <b>term)</b> <b>in</b> highly scattering medium. © (2013) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

The next largest population groups were Whites, at 10 percent, and Hispanics, at 6 percent. According to the 2010 Census, segregation in Detroit has decreased in absolute and <b>in</b> <b>relative</b> <b>terms.</b> In {{the first decade of}} the 21st century, about two-thirds of the total black population in metropolitan area resided within the city limits of Detroit.

A 2011 op-ed in The New York Times attributed the decreased segregation rating to the overall exodus from the city, cautioning that these areas may soon become more segregated. This pattern already happened in the 1970s, when apparent integration was actually a precursor to white flight and resegregation. Over a 60-year period, white flight occurred in the city. According to an estimate of the Michigan Metropolitan Information Center, from 2008 to 2009 the percentage of non-Hispanic White residents increased from 8.4% to 13.3%. Some empty nesters and many younger White people moved into the city while many African Americans moved to the suburbs.|$|E
