40|$|AbstractMartensitic {{stainless}} steel materials have provided some benefits for aerospace, automotive, hydroelectric engines, cutlery, defense, power hand tools, pump parts, valve seats, chisels, bushings, ball bearings, sporting equipment industry, <b>dental</b> and <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> etc. {{due to their}} hardness, strength, and wear resistance. Machining operations such as milling, turning, drilling {{can be applied to}} give them the final form. But, these kinds of steels are specified as hard-to-machine materials owing to their high strength, low thermal conductivity and work hardening tendency during machining operations. However, martensitic {{stainless steel}}s can be machined by using cutting fluids which are environmentally hazardous, unhealthy, and costly. In this study, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) method was applied by using commercial vegetable cutting fluid and 1 %wt. of nano MoS 2 (Molybdenum Disulphide) particles reinforced vegetable cutting fluid during milling of AISI 420 martensitic stainless steel with uncoated Tungsten Carbide (WC) cutting tool and the sustainable milling operation was performed. The experiments were carried out at constant cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut. Two different amounts of nanofluids – pressure air mist supplied by MQL system were applied as 20 ml/h and 40 ml/h. In the consequence of milling operations, initial tool wear and surface roughness were investigated. According to the experimental results, the MQL method reduced the tool wear and surface roughness. In addition, minimum tool wear and surface roughness values were obtained in nano MQL milling at 40 ml/h MQL flow rate...|$|R

40|$|Names for instruments, tools, {{devices and}} {{accessories}} in Slavonic languages This article {{is devoted to}} the names for ‘instruments’, ‘tools’, ‘devices’ and ‘accessories’ in Slavonic languages. As it was described in this paper, there is no common name, which is an equivalent of Latin ‘instrumentum’ in Slavonic languages. The name, coming from Latin instrumentum, is known in the majority of the languages (except Czech and Slovak), but its scope of the meaning is not the same. In Polish it concerns only musical and medical (mainly <b>surgical,</b> <b>dental,</b> laryngological) <b>instruments,</b> but for instance in Bulgarian and Macedonian it is also used in the meaning ‘tool’ (sometimes also in Serbo-Croatian). In Slovenian it is used both in the meaning ‘musical instrument’, but also ‘special device, used in medical, scientific and measurement purpose’. This name has also a wide range of meaning in the East-Slavonic languages, especially in Russian (concerns not only to musical and medical (<b>surgical)</b> <b>instruments,</b> but also to any tool, used by craftsmen). The name, continuing *pri-borъ is known in the majority of Slavonic languages, but their semantic scope is different (the largest is in Serbo-Croatian). An Old Slavonic word *orǫdьje in the majority of the Slavonic languages has the meaning ‘tool, instrument’, in some languages means ‘canon’, but in Polish it has quite different meaning (for instance, Orędzie Prezydenta RP). The noun, continuing *na-rędъ is present in each West-Slavonic language, and – with a preffix – also in the East Slavonic. The noun, coming from the *pri-rędъ, exists only in Polish, but it has an equivalent *pri-ladъ in Ukrainian and Byelorussian. The word, origins from Turkish alât is a lexical Balkanism, noticed only in the languages of Balkan Slaves (Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbo-Croatian). Other names for ‘instruments, tools, devices, accessories’, described in this article, are not common, and exist only in separate languages...|$|R

In our research project we are conducting research on a small company of Pakistan. The name of the company is NATA Surgical International. The company is a small business entity located at Sialkot, a city of Pakistan. It is working with local suppliers, who export the <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> to foreign countries. NATA Surgical International desires to remove this middle man barrier and wants to reach the customers directly. NATA Surgical International is looking for two opportunities; either they should start supplying <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> directly to domestic hospitals or start exporting <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> to foreign countries. A research was carried out by the NATA management who identified that 50 % of its <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> are directly exported to Europe from Pakistan. With the help of these statistics, we on behalf of NATA Surgical International try to investigate on the two different markets. This research explore the opportunities for NATA Surgical International to either expand its sales further within the domestic market, by selling directly to dealers, or in the European market. We investigate the best markets within the European countries, as well as study domestic opportunities and barriers...|$|R

40|$|<b>Surgical</b> <b>instrument</b> {{processing}} {{is crucial}} for safety, high-quality surgical care but has received a little thought in the medical literature. Typical hospitals have inventories {{in the tens of}} thousands of <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> organized into thousands of instrument sets. The use of these instruments for many procedures per day leads to millions of instrument sets being reprocessed yearly in a single hospital (Blackmore, Bishop, Luker, & Williams, 2013). In this project student are proposing a potential method to provide solution to the problem of errors in the processing of sterile instruments that lead to increased functioning times and costs. Automated Visual Tracking System comprised of a system on which the names and pictures of <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> required for a surgical procedure are selectively displayed for reading the optically readable code mark; and a computer which stores the data about <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> for the <b>surgical</b> procedure. The optically readable code mark on a <b>surgical</b> <b>instrument</b> is read by the reader and inputted into the computer, by which the read and inputted <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> are consecutively identified on a screen, and finally the preparation of <b>surgical</b> <b>instrument</b> sets can be prepared. Development of Visual Tracking System for <b>Surgical</b> <b>Instrument</b> is to help to minimize problems that may arise in tracking instruments and to make the management become more efficient. Detection system equipment can then be used to set up a database of information about where each piece of equipment is in the right location. In particular, readers are actively or passively can provide information concerning the completeness of whether the detection system center or remotely via the electrical wiring of the existing or via a network or other system that can carry any information (Black, 1999) using a bar code requires labor -intensive steps to visit the facility with one or more mobile scanner...|$|R

40|$|Health care {{providers}} have been continuously increasing {{their interest in}} tracking products. The plethora of goods that they need, the number of persons involved and the enormous space that they have makes an imperative to manage and control everything. In most cases, health {{care providers}} are labelling all products with technologies that can range from bar-coding to RFID. However, the great variety in terms of items to track (shape, material, size, etc) limits the adoption of such technologies. In some cases, existing products are fully optimized and any changes, even small ones, are impossible. This {{is the case of}} <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments.</b> Incorporating RFID in <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> is not trivial, as moisture, metal surfaces and temperature can affect the tag reliability, and the <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> have very demanding requirements, having been optimized over decades (or centuries) for specific applications, our first approach to achieve an instrument traceability solution was the development of a polymer-based add-on product that features an embedded RFID, and which could be coupled to the <b>surgical</b> <b>instrument.</b> To ensure that the placement of the RFID tag does not hamper or limit the performance of the health professional using the <b>surgical</b> <b>instrument,</b> it was necessary to conduct an ergonomic evaluation to investigate the contact points between the surgeons’ hands and the <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments.</b> In this framework, we have conducted a survey with 54 surgeons to discover the contact points with 7 different types of <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> that covers a major generic set (72 <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments),</b> and we describe how it was employed {{in the creation of a}} design solution. Future work includes prototyping parts, with the embedded RFID tag, and usability tests. The developed product should allow for a fast and accurate count during surgical and sterilizing operations, and, at the same time, knowing the number of uses of each instrument, as well as the specific set to which the instrument belongs.
