40|$|Software <b>exploits</b> {{are one of}} {{the major}} threats to the Internet security. A large family of <b>exploits</b> works by corrupting memory of the victim process to execute {{malicious}} code. To quickly respond to these attacks, it is critical to automatically diagnose such <b>exploits</b> to find out how they circumvent existing defense mechanisms. Because of the complexity of the victim programs and sophistication of recent <b>exploits,</b> existing analysis techniques fall short: they either miss important attack steps or report too much irrelevant information. In this paper, based on the observation that the key steps in memory corruption <b>exploits</b> often involve pointer misuses, we propose a novel solution, PointerScope, to use type inference on binary execution to detect the pointer misuses induced by an <b>exploit.</b> These pointer misuses highlight the important attack steps of the <b>exploit,</b> and therefore convey valuable information about the <b>exploit</b> mechanisms. Our approach complements dependency-based solutions to perform more comprehensive diagnosis of sophisticated memory <b>exploits.</b> We prototyped PointerScope and evaluated it using real-world <b>exploit</b> samples and demonstrated that PointerScope can successfully capture the key attack steps, which significantly facilitates attack response. ...|$|R

50|$|Heap sprays {{have been}} used {{occasionally}} in <b>exploits</b> since at least 2001, but the technique started to see widespread use in <b>exploits</b> for web browsers {{in the summer of}} 2005 after the release of several such <b>exploits</b> which used the technique against a wide range of bugs in Internet Explorer. The heap sprays used in all these <b>exploits</b> were very similar, which showed the versatility of the technique and its ease of use, without need for major modifications between <b>exploits.</b> It proved simple enough to understand and use to allow novice hackers to quickly write reliable <b>exploits</b> for many types of vulnerabilities in web browsers and web browser plug-ins.

40|$|Drive-by {{downloads}} are {{the preferred}} distribution vector for many malware families. In the drive-by ecosystem, many <b>exploit</b> servers run the same <b>exploit</b> kit {{and it is}} a challenge understanding whether the <b>exploit</b> server {{is part of a larger}} operation. In this paper, we propose a technique to identify <b>exploit</b> servers managed by the same organization. We collect over time how <b>exploit</b> servers are configured, which <b>exploits</b> they use, and what malware they distribute, grouping servers with similar configurations into operations. Our operational analysis reveals that although individual <b>exploit</b> servers have a median lifetime of 16 h, long-lived operations exist that operate for several months. To sustain long-lived operations, miscreants are turning to the cloud, with 60 % of the <b>exploit</b> servers hosted by specialized cloud hosting services. We also observe operations that distribute multiple malware families and that pay-per-install affiliate programs are managing <b>exploit</b> servers for their affiliates to convert traffic into installations. Furthermore, we analyze the <b>exploit</b> polymorphism problem, measuring the repacking rate for different <b>exploit</b> types. To understand how difficult is to takedown <b>exploit</b> servers, we analyze the abuse reporting process and issue abuse reports for 19 long-lived servers. We describe the interaction with ISPs and hosting providers and monitor the result of the report. We find that 61 % of the reports are not even acknowledged. On average, an <b>exploit</b> server still lives for 4. 3 days after a report. Finally, we detail the Malicia dataset we have collected and are making available to other researchers. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{argue that}} finding {{vulnerabilities}} in software components is dif-ferent from finding <b>exploits</b> against them. <b>Exploits</b> that compromise security often use several low-level {{details of the}} component,such as layouts of stack frames. Existing software analysis tools, while effective at identifying vulnerabilities, fail to model low-leveldetails, and are hence unsuitable for exploit-finding. We study the issues involved in exploit-finding by consideringapplication programming interface (API) level <b>exploits.</b> A software component is vulnerable to an API-level <b>exploit</b> if its se-curity can be compromised by invoking a sequence of API operations allowed by the component. We present a framework tomodel low-level details of APIs, and develop an automatic technique based on bounded, infinite-state model checking to discoverAPI-level <b>exploits.</b> We present two instantiations of this framework. We show thatformat-string <b>exploits</b> can be modeled as API-level <b>exploits,</b> and demonstrate our technique by finding <b>exploits</b> against vulnerabili-ties in widely-used software. We also use the framework to model a cryptographic-key management API (the IBM CCA) and demon-strate a tool that identifies a previously known <b>exploit...</b>|$|R
