The information <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>gain</b> (IERG), the energy reduction gain (ERG) and the resource utilization gain (RUG) of the NC schemes with and without subcarrier division duplexing (SDD) are obtained by computer simulations. The usefulness of the NC schemes are evaluated for varying traffic load levels, the geographical distances between the nodes, the RS transmit powers, and the maximum numbers of retransmissions. Simulation results show that the NC schemes with and without SDD, have the throughput gains 0. 5 % and 25 %, the ERGs 7 - 12 % and 16 - 25 %, and the RUGs 0. 5 - 3. 2 %, respectively. It is found that the NC can provide performance gains also for the users at the cell edge. Furthermore, the ERGs of the NC increase with the transmit power of the relay while the ERGs of the NC remain the same even when the maximum number of retransmissions is reduced...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} effects on the optimal {{monetary}} policy design problem of allowing for deviations from the law of one price in import goods prices. We reach three basic results. First, incomplete pass-through renders the analysis of monetary policy of an open economy fundamentally {{different from the one}} of a closed economy, unlike canonical models with perfect pass-through which emphasize a type of isomorphism. Second, and in response to efficient productivity shocks, incomplete pass-through has the effect of generating endogenously a short-run tradeoff between the stabilization of inflation and of the output gap. Third, in studying the optimal program under commitment relative to discretion, we show that the former entails a smoothing of the deviations from the law of one price, in stark contrast with the established empirical evidence. In addition, an optimal commitment policy always requires, relative to discretion, more stable nominal and real <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> JEL Classification: E 52, E 32, F 41 deviations from the law of one price, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> channel, <b>gains</b> from commitment, policy trade-off...|$|R

The three substantive chapters each consider specific aspects of relevance to {{the determination of the}} <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> from an asset market view of perfect capital mobility.

40|$|We {{study the}} conduct of {{monetary}} policy in a continuum of small open economies. We solve the model globally in closed form without restricting the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods to one. Using this global closed-form solution, we give an exact characterization of optimal monetary policy and welfare with and without international policy cooperation. We consider the cases of internationally complete asset markets and financial autarky, producer currency pricing and local currency pricing. Under producer currency pricing, it is always optimal to mimic the flexible-price equilibrium through a policy of price stability. Under local currency pricing, policy should fix the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> Even if substitutability differs from one, the continuum of small open economies implies that the share of each country's output in the world consumption basket (and therefore {{the impact of the}} country's monopoly power) is negligible. This removes the incentive to deviate from price stability under producer currency pricing or a fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> under local currency pricing. There are no gains from international monetary cooperation in all cases examined. Our results stand in contrast to those in the literature on optimal monetary policy for large open economies, where strategic interactions drive optimal policy away from price stability or fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> and <b>gains</b> from cooperation are present, when substitutability differs from one. ...|$|R
40|$|Dutch disease {{occurs when}} {{government}} revenue from a booming non-renewable natural resource export sector {{is spent on}} recurrent domestic activities. Dutch disease amplifies the cyclical influence of commodity prices and inflicts adjustment costs on the economy through movements in the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> Revenue funds, such as revenue stabilisation funds or sovereign wealth funds, can help avoid this problem by either investing revenue abroad until downturns or holding revenue abroad indefinitely. Through an investigation of six open, natural resource exporting countries, revenue funds were found to delink <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements from the terms of trade. Although {{it is unlikely that}} revenue funds are the sole cause of this effect, revenue funds are considered a useful tool for, but not essential to, responsible fiscal management. Western Australia has been found to have Dutch disease. Recurrent government expenditure is vulnerable to decreases in royalty receipts. High levels of mineral exports are partly responsible for the high Australian dollar. Revenue funds are a potential policy tool if the Western Australian government decides to limit the impact of export prices on Australia’s <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> As this is unlikely to be an objective for a state government, it should instead be seen as an added benefit to countercyclical or sustainable fiscal policies. In this case, only a sovereign wealth fund is considered appropriate at the state level and could be used to manage royalties sustainably, reduce movements in Australia’s <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>gain</b> greater fiscal autonomy for the states.

40|$|In {{this essay}} I explore the {{implications}} of regional economic integration for the currency arrangements appropriate within and between regions. This topic is motivated by the recent rekindling of interest in fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> which, in turn, has been {{due in part to}} disappointment in the performance of the flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system that has evolved over the past two decades, and in part to the increased regional economic integration that the world economy has witnessed in the past decade. i review some of the issues pertaining to the performance of flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> but the primary focus of the essay is on the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> implications of economic integration. The essay returns to many of the issues raised in Robert Mundell's classic 1961 essay, "A Theory of Optimal Currency Areas". that essay was written in large part as a cautionary reaction to the apparent increasing favor that flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> were <b>gaining</b> with economists at the time. Much of the focus of the recent literature is on the case for fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> arising out of the creation of a "single-market" under the Europe 1992 program for European monetary union. In contrast, in this paper I focus on issues arising from the current Canadian situation. Of particular interest is the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement signed in January 1988, and which now appears likely to evolve into a broader North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, incorporating Mexico. While the FTA to date has not given rise to any strong constituency for a North American monetary union, the increased international integration that the FTA and NAFTA represent, combined with recent and prospective developments related to our constitutional negotiations which might be viewed as weakening aspects of the Canadian economic union, have led to renewed interest in the debate over whether Canada's national interests might be better served with a fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> vis a vis the US dollar. I reject the case for a fixed Canada-US <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> and argue that the current Bank of Canada regime [...] a flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> with a medium-term inflation target [...] is not only appropriate but the only one supported by available evidence and theory about how the economy functions.

40|$|At {{the heart}} of the {{evaluation}} of the economic costs and benefits of adopting the euro lies the question of whether living standards would be higher outside or inside the Euro Area. It is well established that there is a strong positive relationship between openness to international trade and investment and the performance of the UK economy. European integration is continuing to help raise the openness of the UK economy, as well as stimulating product market competition and making the UK a more attractive location for mobile investments. This provides an additional channel through which potential output in the UK is linked to the degree of integration with the rest of Europe. Adopting a common currency may bring modest further gains to productivity and living standards by stimulating trade as well as competition. Reducing <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility may also raise the level of fixed capital investment in the UK, although the direct evidence for this is limited, and stimulate inward investment from outside Europe, but could reduce the level of foreign direct investment between the UK and the Euro Area. However it is far from clear how big the net benefits might be or how soon they might start to appear.

40|$|Assuming the {{eventual}} {{adoption of the}} Euro, the paper reviews the run-up and the medium run issues on the path towards the Euro. It shows that various policy options are possible, especially {{with respect to the}} <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime and management. It also shows the limits of monetary policy when fiscal and income policies are not consistent with monetary policy. In the run-up phase of accession, the main constraints come from the recommendation to target a conversion <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> while major <b>gains</b> can be obtained from an increase in money demand and a fall in interest rates once market expectations converge towards the conversion. In the medium run preparation, a fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> extracts a high price in terms of high real interest rates and losses of competitiveness, unless fiscal policy is tight and wage settlement are market-based or kept under control. Floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> do not necessarily solve these problems but enable monetary policy to regain some of the effectiveness that it loses under fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> Eventually, a sound fiscal and income policy opens the way to a scenario of accommodating monetary policy and convergence towards the Euro.

40|$|Recently, {{the issue}} of a decline in <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> {{pass-through}} has <b>gained</b> much more attention. Taylor conjectures that a worldwide decline in <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pass-through is related to the low and stable inflation in many industrialized countries since the early 1990 s. Developments of 'new open-economy macroeconomics' also cast renewed attention on <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pass-through. Theoretical research shows that the choice of an optimal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime and the transmission of monetary policy impacts depend crucially on the exporter's price setting behaviour. There are many studies on the pass-through of Japanese exports, yet most studies simply use the industry-breakdown data on export price indices, which is insufficient to assess pass-through patterns in regional trade. Significantly, highly disaggregated (HS 9 -digit level) commodity data are used here to evaluate the extent of pass-through by commodity and by destination. We investigate and compare the extent of pass-through to East Asia, Europe, and the US. We also examine whether there is any difference in the degree of pass-through in the pre- and post-Asian crisis era. Results suggest the most pricing-to-market (PTM) occurs in exports to the US market followed by significant, but less PTM in Europe. Virtually no PTM is found in Japanese exports to East Asia. Also, there is no clear evidence of either increasing or decreasing pass-through over time. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

Aside {{from its}} devastating effects on global economy, global financial crisis has also shaken the mainstream economic theory. After the crisis, policies implemented by governments and Central Banks, issues of financial stability, impacts of international capital flows and <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> {{have become the}} center of macroeconomic research. This thesis examines the impact of global financial crisis on the IT framework. The aim is to discuss the imperfections and defections in the framework and propose extensions. In this context, a small open economy DSGE model, calibrated for Turkey during 2003 - 2012 is proposed. The base model is extended to capture dynamics of Turkish economy better. Since, trade and credit channels of transmission mechanism of crisis are the most powerful channels for the contagion of the crisis to Turkish economy, inclusion of {{net international investment position}} (to the problems of households and entrepreneurs) and imported capital good (to the production function) strengthen the explanatory power of the model considerably. Moreover, to address whether allowing Central Bank to respond <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> yields <b>gains</b> in terms of output and inflation stabilization, an augmented Taylor rule which incorporates <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> is constructed. Responses under the benchmark model where Central Bank uses a traditional Taylor rule and an augmented Taylor rule are obtained. To provide a reference in interpreting the findings of the model, a Vector Auto Regression analysis is performed with interest rates, inflation, output level and <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> as endogenous variables. Finally, results of the model experiments and VAR are compared. The results indicate that, the model with the augmented Taylor rule can help to smooth business cycle fluctuations more effectively than conventional Taylor rule but, in some cases, Central Bank may encounter with a tradeoff between output gap and inflation.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990 s drastic devaluations of several European currencies as well as the sustained weakness of the dollar have markedly impaired the price competitiveness of those countries whose currencies are linked to the German mark. For Austria's export and tourism sector, the weakness of the currencies of important trading partners, Italy in particular, constitutes a serious challenge. The revised WIFO <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> index, with 1992 as the base year, will improve the analysis of the macroeconomic effects of changes in the <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> The index measures the relation between the schilling and a "basket of currencies" from 23 OECD countries. The weight of each currency is based on the importance of each country in Austria's foreign trade. As in the old index the international purchasing power of the schilling is mainly determined by the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> of the schilling against the German mark. The weight of the German mark rose from 43. 2 percent in 1979 to 47. 5 percent in 1992, a rise of 4. 3 percentage points. The share of the dollar sank by 2. 2 percentage points to 8. 4 percent; but the dollar still takes third place behind the Italian lira (10. 6 percent). The weight of the Swiss franc dropped sharply to fifth place, from 6. 6 percent to 4. 7 percent; the French franc advanced to fourth place (5. 7 percent). The British pound (4. 4 percent) and the Dutch guilder (3. 7 percent) remain among the more important currencies. With a weight of 3. 1 percent (+ 0. 6 percentage point), the Japanese yen is ranked as number eight. The currencies of the EU countries have a total weight of 81. 5 percent, while the five overseas countries have a share of 12. 5 percent. "Third market effects", which reflect the competition between Austrian firms and exporters from other countries in foreign markets, have gained in importance in the computation of index weights. The weight of third market effects in the index of manufacturing products rose from 13. 4 percent in 1979 to 17. 1 percent in 1992. This shift is due to the intensification of international trade: domestic production as a percentage of production in OECD countries fell from 74. 1 percent to 62. 8 percent. Third market effects are almost twice as high in tourism (30. 7 percent) as in trade with manufactured goods. Since the establishment of the EMS in 1979, the value of the schilling rose against all currencies {{with the exception of the}} Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. Over the last fifteen years, the trade-weighted <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> of the schilling rose by 28 percent in nominal terms, by slightly less than 2 percent per year. The strongest contributions came from the small soft-currency countries and from Italy (8. 7 percent). If the trade-weighted index is adjusted for inflation differentials, the appreciation in real terms is 9. 2 percent. Nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>gains</b> of the schilling against soft currencies are largely offset by higher inflation rates in these countries. The largest contribution to the rise in the trade-weighted <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> of the schilling in real terms comes from the German mark: in the long run inflation rates were lower in Germany than in Austria. But Austria has lost ground in terms of price stability in comparison with other trading partners as well: while in the first half of the eighties the accumulated rate of inflation in the OECD countries was 10 percentage points higher than in Austria, this differential dropped to 4 percentage points during the period 1990 to 1994. This means that since the mid- 1980 s the appreciation in real terms has become more pronounced, reducing the price competitiveness in international trade. Since 1992 Austria has been less and less successful in compensating the rise in the nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> by lower inflation rates.

The theoretical model developed in this paper incorporates the traditional FDI model based on the OLI-framework into the Tobin’s Q-model of investment. The model is estimated using the fixed effects panel estimator, with the euro area proxied by a panel involving most of the euro area countries. In accordance to the theoretical model, the investment climate in the euro area, as reflected in Tobin’s Q – including a measure adjusted for economic developments common to both the United States and the euro area- is found to influence euro area FDI to the United States. Moreover, {{the inclusion of the}} Tobin’s Q seems to enhance the traditional OLI framework specification by adding further explanatory power to the FDI equation. Overall, the empirical findings suggest that euro area patents (ownership advantage), various variables related to productivity in the United States (location advantage), the volume of bilateral telephone traffic to the United States relative to euro area GDP (location advantage), Tobin’s Q and the real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> (capital <b>gains)</b> are statistically significant determinants of euro area FDI to the United States...|$|R

Rather, intermediate regimes have shown remarkable durability. The analysis suggests that as economies mature, the value of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility rises. For countries at a relatively early stage of financial development and integration, fixed or relatively rigid regimes appear to offer some anti-inflation credibility gain without compromising growth objectives. As countries develop economically and institutionally, there appear to be considerable benefits to more flexible regimes.

It also considers the determinants of the REER {{in connection with the}} choice of exchange regime after unification. The study illustrates how economic policy variables and exogenous shocks affect the real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> primarily through the fiscal balance, and consequently, the savings-investment gap. It further illustrates that the appropriate level of REER and its medium-term path depend upon the mix of monetary, fiscal, and structural policies that underpin the evolution of inflation, balance of payments, and productivity growth. <b>Exchange</b> rates;Exchange <b>rate</b> unification;Real effective <b>exchange</b> rates;Exchange <b>rate</b> regimes;exchange <b>rate,</b> real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> oil exports, reer, real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> foreign <b>exchange,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, export <b>rate,</b> effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> current account balance, equilibrium <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system, multiple <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> multiple <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> official <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> markets, exporters, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policy, oil export, <b>exchange</b> controls, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> systems, nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> developments, average <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> real <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> export performance, dual <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> parallel <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> guarantees, market <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> export sector, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> adjustments, export receipts, <b>exchange</b> restrictions, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> management, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> adjustment, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> import prices, export sales, foreign exchange budget, unification of <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> multiple <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> target, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> index, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> bilateral <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> export competitiveness, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> depreciation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> arrangements, currency boards, multiple currency practices, parallel <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> markets, foreign exchange market, capital flight, export prices, capital flows, <b>exchange</b> arrangements, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> dynamics, oil exporting, exchange earnings, surveillance over <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policies, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> mechanism, currency markets, amount of export, foreign exchange reserves, exports of oil, currency convertibility, export repatriation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policies, export sectors, export price index, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> appreciation, <b>exchange</b> market intervention, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes, multiple <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> systems, export ? <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> variations, domestic <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> guarantee, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> transactions, foreign exchange earnings, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, currency devaluation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> misalignment, export price, nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> reserves, foreign <b>exchange</b> transactions, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> losses, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> bands, net exports, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> targets, oil exporter, trade taxes, <b>exchange</b> policy, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> appreciation, <b>exchange</b> brokers, export transactions, oil exporters, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> exporter, <b>exchange</b> risk, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> level...|$|R

This "learning to float" appears to have involved a strengthening of monetary and financial policy frameworks aimed at directly addressing the key vulnerabilities {{that give rise to}} the "fear of floating.
