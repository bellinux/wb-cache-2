This paper extends the results of our previous work, where the <b>doubling</b> <b>operation</b> for polytopes was used to prove the toral rank conjecture for moment-angle manifolds. 1 1 Doubling operations Here we give the definition of the “doubling operation ” and discuss its main properties. The author learned about the definition below from a communication with the authors of the recent work [1], in which the importance of the “doubling operation ” in toric topology has been first demonstrated. Definition 1. 1. Let K be an arbitrary simplicial complex on the vertex set [m] = {v 1, [...] ., vm}. The double of K is the simplicial complex L(K) on the vertex set [2 m] = {v 1, v ′ 1, [...] ., vm, v ′ m} determined by the following condition: ω ⊂ [2 m] is the minimal (by inclusion) missing simplex of L(K) iff ω is of the form {vi 1, v ′ i 1, [...] ., vi k, v ′ i k}, where {vi 1, [...] ., vi k} is a missing simplex of K. If K = ∂P ∗ is a boundary of the dual of the simple polytope P, then L(K) coincides with L(P) ∗, see Definition 1 in [7]. The <b>doubling</b> <b>operation</b> for simple polytopes has also featured in the recent work [5] o...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in the computer graphics of woven images on surfaces in 3 -space motivate the development of weavings for arbitrary genus surfaces. We present herein a general framework for weaving structures on general surfaces in 3 -space, and through it, we demonstrate how weavings on such surfaces are inducible from connected graph imbeddings on the same surfaces. The necessary and sufficient conditions to identify the inducible weavings in our framework are also given. For low genus surfaces, like plane and torus, we extend our framework to the weavings which are inducible from disconnected imbedded graphs. In particular, we show all weavings on a plane are inducible in our framework, including most Celtic Knots. Moreover, we study different weaving structures on general surfaces in 3 -space based on our framework. We show that any weaving inducible in our framework can be converted into an alternating weaving by appropriately changing the strand orders at some crossings. By applying a topological surgery operation, called <b>doubling</b> <b>operation,</b> we can refine a weaving or convert certain non-twillable weavings into twillable weavings on the same surfaces. Interestingly, two important subdivision algorithms on graphs imbeddings, the Catmull-Clark and Doo-Sabin algorithms, correspond nicely to our <b>doubling</b> <b>operation</b> on induced weavings. Another technique we used in studying weaving structures is repetitive patterns. A weaving that can be converted into a twillable weaving by our <b>doubling</b> <b>operation</b> has a highly-symmetric structure, which consists of only two repetitive patterns. An extension of the symmetric structure leads to Quad-Pattern Coverable meshes, which can be seamlessly covered with only one periodic pattern. Both of these two topological structures can be represented with simple Permutation Voltage graphs. A considerable advantage of our model {{is that it is}} topological. This permits the graphic designer to superimpose strand colors and geometric attributes ? distances, angles, and curvatures ? that conform to manufacturing or artistic criteria. We also give a software example for plane weaving construction. A benefit of the software is that it supports plane weaving reconstructions from an image of a plane weaving, which could be useful for recording and modifying existing weavings in real life...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Elliptic curve {{cryptography}} plays {{a crucial}} role in networking and communication security. ECC have evolved in the recent past as an important alternative to established systems like RSA. This paper describes the implementation of an elliptic curve coprocessor based on the FPGA, which can provide a significant speedup for these cryptosystems. The FPGA configuration file is synthesized from VHDL code applying different hardware synthesis products. The implementation of ECC lies in three levels: scalar multiplication, point addition/doubling and finite field modular arithmetic. In this paper, we present a novel fast architecture for the point addition/doubling level in the projective coordinate. The proposed Architecture is based on Binary Field.

Introduction 1. 1. History. It is well-known that to a knot K in an integral homology 3 -sphere M one can associate its (symmetrized, normalized) Alexander polynomial #(M,K), (or #(K), in case M is clear) which is an element of the ring #O := Z[t 1] Sym 2 where Sym 2 acts by sending t to t - 1. The Alexander polynomial measures classical abelian algebraic topology invariants of knots, namely the order of the torsion module H 1 (f M, Z) as a Z[t 1] module, where f M is the universal abelian cover of M rK. There are several ways to view the Alexander polynomial; the one that we wish to emphasize is the surgical view, see [L, Ro]. Form this point of view, the symmetry and normalization of the Alexander polynomial follow [...] ...|$|E
