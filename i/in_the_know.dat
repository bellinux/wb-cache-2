5|$|As {{a result}} of the union dispute, many club patrons no longer visited the night spot. Those who were {{performers}} were informed of the possibility of fines and suspensions by their respective unions for crossing the Stork Club picket line as the issue continued. Many of Billingsley's friendships, including those of Walter Winchell and J. Edgar Hoover, were over as {{a result of}} the union problems. He began firing staff without good cause. As the dispute dragged on, there was also no longer a live band in the dining room for music; members of the Musicians' Union had crossed the picket line to perform for some time. Previously, the club had no need for advertising; it was mentioned frequently in print and word of mouth without it. In 1963, the club offered a hamburger and French fries for $1.99 in a New York Times advertisement; when those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>know</b> about the club saw it, they realized the Stork Club's days were coming to an end. In the last few months of its operation, at times there were only three customers for the entire evening. On a good day in the mid-1940s, some 2,500 people visited the club.|$|E

While attending Grove City High School, Cordray became a champion {{on the high school}} quiz show <b>In</b> <b>The</b> <b>Know</b> and worked for minimum wage at McDonald's. He {{graduated from high school in}} 1977 as co-valedictorian of his class. His first job in politics was as an intern for United States Senator John Glenn as a junior at Michigan State University's James Madison College. Cordray earned Phi Beta Kappa honors and graduated summa cum laude with a BA in Legal & Political Theory in 1981. As a Marshall Scholar, he earned an MA with first class honours in Economics from Brasenose College, Oxford and earned a Varsity Blue in basketball in 1983. At the University of Chicago Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor with honors in 1986, he served as editor-in-chief of the University of Chicago Law Review. After starting work as a law clerk at the U.S. Supreme Court, he came back to his high school to deliver the commencement speech for the graduating class in 1988.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasonable}} suspicion {{test has}} {{the intention of}} protecting public confidence, but Leo and Chen wonder how accurately this test actually reflects the public's view. The test as formulated in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin requires that the reasonable man be sitting in court and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>know</b> of all the relevant facts. However, this is usually not the case. Most of the public only receives information in bits and pieces, and thus even if a case passes the reasonable suspicion test, the public may not be satisfied {{that there was no}} possibility of bias. Thus the concept that the reasonable suspicion test reflects the public's perspective is overstated. The practical reality is that when the reasonable man is imbued with all the relevant facts, he will essentially be in the same position as the court. Therefore, the suggested approach is that the court, in personifying the reasonable man, should take into account all relevant circumstances and determine if there is the suspicion or possibility of the appearance of bias whilst being mindful to exclude considerations stemming from the individual judge's personal preferences, special knowledge and legal sophistication.|$|E

[...] The 1855 session {{was one of the}} most productive in the state's history, with about 600 bills and resolutions passed. [...] In his inaugural address, Gardner set what he hoped was a tone that would solidify his position has the party leader. [...] The speech focused almost to exclusion on nativist issues, and included hyperbolic claims that the level of immigration was reaching crisis proportions. Gardner notably omitted popular substantive reform issues such as the ten-hour workday, and also avoided the contentious subject of slavery.|$|E
500|$|In Las Hilanderas, {{probably}} {{painted the}} year after Las Meninas, two different scenes from Ovid are shown: one in contemporary dress in the foreground, and the other partly in antique dress, played before a tapestry on {{the back wall of}} a room behind the first. According to the critic Sira Dambe, [...] "aspects of representation and power are addressed in this painting in ways closely connected with their treatment in Las Meninas". In a series of portraits of the late 1630s and 1640s—all now in the Prado—Velázquez painted clowns {{and other members of the}} royal household posing as gods, heroes, and philosophers; the intention is certainly partly comic, at least for those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>know,</b> but in a highly ambiguous way.|$|E
500|$|On 23 October 2000, Shahaf and Doriel invited CBS 60 Minutes to {{film the}} reenactment. Doriel told the correspondent, Bob Simon, that he {{believed}} the boy's death was real, but {{that it had been}} set up to damage Israel. Those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>know,</b> he said, included the cameraman and the boy's father, though the latter had not realized the boy would be killed. When General Samia heard about the interview, he removed Doriel from the investigation. The investigators' report was shown to the head of Israeli military intelligence; the key points were published in November 2000 as not ruling out that the IDF had shot the boy, though describing it as [...] "quite plausible" [...] that he had been hit by Palestinian bullets aimed at the IDF post. The inquiry provoked widespread criticism. A Haaretz editorial said, [...] "it is hard to describe in mild terms the stupidity of this bizarre investigation." ...|$|E

500|$|The album has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. Fraser McAlpine of the BBC wrote: [...] "At its best, it's a loving homage; at worst it's like the re-made pop music retailers play in shops {{to avoid paying}} proper royalties." [...] He felt that: [...] "As they are essentially photocopies of the originals, the songs depend on {{the context of the}} show to make sense. So listening to the album on musical merits alone is close to pointless." [...] AllMusic's Andrew Leahey rated the album 3.5/5, writing: [...] "It's a short release, but it also holds its ground against the two albums that preceded it, namely because the material is so compatible with the show itself. Madonna's music has always thrived on drama, and it lends itself well to Glee theater-pop approach, which tends to bring out the cheese in even the most serious of songs." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy rated the EP 4/5, praising the [...] "imaginative reworking" [...] of [...] "What It Feels Like For a Girl", and noting: [...] "if the Glee treatment encourages a few younger pop fans to invest in Madonna's stellar recent hits collection, it can only be viewed as a good thing. And for those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>know,</b> hearing five members of this thoroughly likable cast trilling [...] "Like A Virgin" [...] in harmony is so downright gleeful, well, it's almost like being touched for the very first time." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{town meeting}} {{attracted}} a packed crowd of over a thousand, with Nixon supporters distributing anti-Voorhis literature at the door. The Senate proxies spoke first for their candidates, followed by Voorhis. Nixon, who had notified organizers {{that he would}} be late due to another commitment, arrived during Voorhis's speech, and remained backstage until the congressman had completed his talk. He then came onstage, shook hands with Voorhis, and delivered a fifteen-minute address. A question-and-answer period then followed, with a Nixon supporter asking Voorhis about his onetime Socialist registration, and about his views on monetary policy. [...] After the representative responded, a Voorhis supporter asked Nixon why he was making [...] "false charges" [...] about the supposed Voorhis CIO-PAC endorsement. [...] In response, Nixon reached into his pocket and pulled out a copy of a Southern California NCPAC bulletin mentioning the group's endorsement of Voorhis. [...] The congressman was unaware of the endorsement; those of his aides <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>know</b> had [...] "completely forgotten" [...] to tell him. [...] Nixon walked halfway across the stage and displayed it to Voorhis, asking him to read it for himself. Voorhis came from his seat and took it, and (according to Bullock, who served as timekeeper at the debate) [...] "mumbled" [...] that this seemed to be a different organization from the CIO-PAC. [...] Nixon reclaimed the document, and began to read out names {{of the members of the}} boards of directors of the two groups, [...] "It's the same thing, virtually, when they have the same directors." [...] The crowd began to cheer Nixon, who later wrote, [...] "I could tell by the audience reaction that I had made my point", and to jeer Voorhis, who wrote, [...] "They'd boo and laugh at my remarks, and this disturbed me." ...|$|E

[...] Reportedly, Carol also ordered Kalinderu to admonish Crown Prince Ferdinand and Princess Marie for their lavish spending. The future Queen Marie was much amused by Kalinderu, describing him as [...] "little, round, with a short beard and a pronounced Semitic nose; one of his eyes sparkled wickedly, showing an unusually sharp intelligence". She recalled a visit with him to Windsor Castle, where [...] "it was truly amusing to see the short gentleman very pleased with himself, catching everything with his glimpse, weighing, judging, taking the measure of people and things, with that small, penetrating, almost wicked eye". Even when meeting Queen Victoria, his eye [...] "roved throughout, as if he feared missing something".
