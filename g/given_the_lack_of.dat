5|$|<b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{a living}} will, a trial was held before Pinellas County Judge George Greer {{during the week}} of January 24, 2000 to {{determine}} what Terri Schiavo's wishes would have been regarding life-prolonging procedures. Michael Schiavo was represented by attorney George Felos, who had won a landmark right-to-die case before the Florida Supreme Court in 1990.|$|E
5|$|In Baghdad, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{firm and}} public {{leadership}} by Mirza Yahya, the Babi community {{had fallen into}} disarray. Some Babis, including Bahá'u'lláh's family, began searching for Bahá'u'lláh, and when news of a man living in the mountains {{under the name of}} Darvish Muhammad spread to neighboring areas, Bahá'u'lláh's family begged him to come back to Baghdad. On 19 March 1856, after two years in Kurdistan he returned to Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|Military {{thinking}} shifted rapidly. <b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{equipment and}} properly trained men, Ironside had {{had little choice}} but to adopt a strategy of static warfare, but it was soon perceived that this would not be sufficient. Ironside has been criticised for having a siege mentality, but some consider this unfair, as he is believed to have understood the limits of the stop lines and never expected them to hold out indefinitely.|$|E

50|$|In {{the week}} of 5 June 2009, the newspaper's {{printing}} house Alasharbaga refused to print it, <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> profit from publishing the newspaper as its reason. Inal Khashig accused the government of being behind the action with the upcoming 12 December 2009 presidential election in mind. This was denied by Prime Minister Alexander Ankvab, who argued that Alasharbaga was a private business, and by Presidential Spokesman Kristian Bzhania, who {{pointed out that the}} newspaper had been warned in advance by its printing house and that Alasharbaga had not stopped publishing the larger government-critical newspaper Ekho Abkhazii.|$|R
5|$|Many of {{the same}} genera were present across these formations, though they varied at the species level. For example, the Djadochta was {{inhabited}} by Velociraptor mongoliensis, Protoceratops andrewsi, and Pinacosaurus grangeri, while the Bayan Mandahu was home to Velociraptor osmolskae, Protoceratops hellenikorhinus, and Pinacosaurus mephistocephalus. These differences in species composition may be due a natural barrier separating the two formations, which are relatively {{close to each other}} geographically. However, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> any known barrier which would cause the specific faunal compositions found in these areas, {{it is more likely that}} those differences indicate a slight time difference.|$|E
5|$|Ryholt dates Sheshi's reign to the mid 18th century BC. His main {{argument}} {{is the presence}} of seals of Sheshi and of two kings of the mid 13th Dynasty Sekhemrekhutawy Khabaw and Djedkheperew in the Egyptian fort of Uronarti in Nubia. The fort of Uronarti was abandoned {{at some point in the}} 13th Dynasty, an event which Ryholt dates to the reign of Djedkheperew <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> seals attributable to subsequent kings. Ryholt thus proposes that Sheshi reigned from c. 1745 BC until 1705 BC and was a contemporary of Khabaw and Djedkheperew.|$|E
5|$|The Sedan bridgeheads {{were still}} not safe. French forces were massing to the south. Guderian {{decided it was}} better to mount an {{aggressive}} defence <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> any suitable anti-tank weapons for a defensive battle. The better option would be to attack rather than defend. The advance of the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions had assisted his progress. They ran into and defeated elements of X Corps near Chemery. The French Corps was heading towards Sedan, but withdrew southward after the engagement. Any potential threat on the German western flank had been removed.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> reason {{traditionally}} <b>given</b> for <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{judicial review}} is the Swiss system of popular democracy: If 50,000 citizens so demand, any new statute is made {{subject to a}} popular referendum. In this sense, it is the people themselves that exercise review.|$|R
5|$|While {{the other}} Visegrád members {{were invited to}} join NATO at its 1997 Madrid summit, Slovakia was {{excluded}} based on what several members considered undemocratic actions by nationalist Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar. Romania and Slovenia were both considered for invitation in 1997, and each had the backing of a prominent NATO member, France and Italy respectively, but support for enlargement was not unanimous, particularly in the US Congress. In {{an open letter to}} US President Bill Clinton, more than forty foreign policy experts including Bill Bradley, Sam Nunn, Gary Hart, Paul Nitze, and Robert McNamara expressed their concerns about NATO expansion as both expensive and unnecessary <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> an external threat from Russia at that time.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate the number of slaves in ancient Greece, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a precise census and variations in definitions during that era. It is certain that Athens had the largest slave population, {{with as many as}} 80,000 in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, on average three or four slaves per household. In the 5th century BC, Thucydides remarked on the desertion of 20,890 slaves during the war of Decelea, mostly tradesmen. The lowest estimate, of 20,000 slaves, during the time of Demosthenes, corresponds to one slave per family. Between 317 BC and 307 BC, the tyrant Demetrius Phalereus ordered a general census of Attica, which arrived at the following figures: 21,000 citizens, 10,000 metics and 400,000 slaves. The orator Hypereides, in his Against Areistogiton, recalls that the effort to enlist 15,000 male slaves of military age led to the defeat of the Southern Greeks at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), which corresponds to the figures of Ctesicles.|$|E
5|$|The hoard {{was buried}} as an oak box or small chest filled with items in {{precious}} metal, sorted mostly by type with some in smaller wooden boxes {{and others in}} bags or wrapped in fabric. Remnants of the chest, and of fittings such as hinges and locks, were recovered in the excavation. The coins of the hoard date it after AD 407, which coincides {{with the end of}} Britain as a Roman province. The owners and reasons for burial of the hoard are unknown, but it was carefully packed and the contents appear consistent with what a single very wealthy family might have owned. <b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> large silver serving vessels and {{of some of the most}} common types of jewellery, it is likely that the hoard represents only a part of the wealth of its owner.|$|E
50|$|In April 2010, Kevin Rudd {{announced}} the delay the CPRS {{until after the}} commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, which ends in 2012. Reasons <b>given</b> were <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> bipartisan support for the CPRS and slow international progress on climate action for the delay.|$|R
50|$|Without the {{guaranteed}} {{orders from}} the MoD, Land Rover {{did not want to}} risk launching the Llama on the civilian market, in direct competition to the successful Unimog, especially <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Llama's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a suitable engine. The project was cancelled in early 1988.|$|R
50|$|The {{army was}} divided into Corps, each {{stationed}} in a particular territory. In 1993, most brigades were renamed as Mountain troops <b>given</b> that <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> heavy weapons made it organizationally pointless to list them as infantry or motorized. In addition, Bosnian terrain favored light infantry over armored and mechanized formations.|$|R
5|$|The limited {{scope of}} the Instruments of Accession {{and the promise of}} a wide-ranging {{autonomy}} and the other guarantees they offered, gave sufficient comfort to many rulers, who saw this as the best deal they could strike <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> support from the British, and popular internal pressures. Between May 1947 and the transfer of power on 15 August 1947, the vast majority of states signed Instruments of Accession. A few, however, held out. Some simply delayed signing the Instrument of Accession. Piploda, a small state in central India, did not accede until March 1948. The biggest problems, however, arose with a few border states, such as Jodhpur, which tried to negotiate better deals with Pakistan, with Junagadh, which actually did accede to Pakistan, and with Hyderabad and Kashmir, which declared that they intended to remain independent.|$|E
