5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>five</b> {{years before}} Texas was complete, the blast effects from end-on fire were {{considered}} prohibitive and en echelon mounting of main guns was abandoned in European navies. This made Texass armament arrangement obsolete. The then-new Board on Construction considered a thorough re-design {{which would have}} placed Texass main guns on the centerline, either in two single turrets or one twin turret, and the heavy redoubt eliminated. Construction by this time was too far advanced for such a plan, however, and Navy Secretary Benjamin Tracy limited the Board to detail improvements.|$|E

Zardari also left for state visits to Kuwait and Russia immediately after the operation while Prime Minister Gillani left for a three-day state visit to France after the operation as well, provoking public sentiment that both had got their priorities wrong.|$|E

25|$|From {{the medieval}} period, {{we have the}} Decameron (1353) by the Italian Giovanni Boccaccio (made into a film by Pasolini) which {{features}} tales of lechery by monks and the seduction of nuns from convents. This book was banned in many countries. <b>Even</b> <b>five</b> centuries after publication copies were seized and destroyed by the authorities in the US and the UK. For instance between 1954 and 1958 eight orders for destruction of the book were made by English magistrates.|$|E

Chiefs of Staff are formally appointed by the cabinet, based on the Defense Minister's recommendation, for three years, but the government can vote to extend their service to four (and on rare occasions <b>even</b> <b>five)</b> years. The current chief of staff is Gadi Eizenkot. He replaced Benny Gantz in 2015.|$|E
25|$|If a cow had {{two black}} or white hairs growing within one follicle, it was invalid. Rabbi Judah said even within one hollow. If the hairs grew within two {{adjacent}} follicles, the cow was invalid. Rabbi Akiva ruled that {{even if there were}} four or <b>even</b> <b>five</b> non-red hairs, if they were dispersed, they could be plucked out. Rabbi Eliezer ruled that even as many as 50 such hairs could be plucked. But Rabbi Joshua ben Bathyra ruled that even if it had only one non-red hair on its head and one on its tail, it was invalid. If the cow had two hairs in one follicle with their roots black and their tips red or with their roots red and their tips black, Rabbi Meir taught that what was visible determined validity; but the Sages ruled that validity followed the root.|$|E

25|$|Mussolini {{was very}} {{unsure of what}} date to invade, as {{he changed his mind}} many times, <b>even</b> <b>five</b> times in one segment of fifteen minutes. Eventually he decided on 28 October, the anniversary of the March on Rome, though staff {{headquarters}} was not aware until they heard the date on London radio. In about two weeks, the Italian army was already retreating back into Albania, for conditions {{at this time of year}} were very detrimental to mountain warfare and general organization problems continued throughout the military. Franco of the recently victorious Fascist side in the Spanish Civil War was pondering entrance into World War II, but Italy's failure in Greece put him off of the idea. Hitler then came in to rescue Mussolini's troops, gaining him the upper hand in all politics and military operations for the rest of the war.|$|E
25|$|Patient G.D. was a {{white male}} born in 1940 {{who served in the}} Navy. He was {{diagnosed}} with chronic renal failure and received hemodialysis treatment {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1983, he went to the hospital for elective parathyroidectomy. He also had a left thyroid lobectomy because of the severe loss of blood in his left lobe. He began having cardiac problems as a result of the surgery and became very agitated. <b>Even</b> <b>five</b> days after being released from the hospital he was unable to remember what had happened to him. Aside from memory impairment, none of his other cognitive processes seemed to be affected. He did not want to be involved in much research, but through memory tests he took with doctors, they were able to ascertain that his memory problems were present for the next 9.5 years until his death. After he died, his brain was donated to science, photographed, and preserved for future study.|$|E

Later volumes will deal with bread, yeast, cakes, creams and cheeses and egg dishes, and meat and game". They were never written, except for English Bread and Yeast Cookery, which is by nearly 100 pages the longest of all David's works.|$|E

500|$|In Orthodox Judaism, a chavrusa always {{refers to}} two {{students}} learning one on one. When {{three or more}} students learn together, they are called a chavurah ( [...] , group). Reform Judaism has expanded the idea of chavrusa to include two, three, four or <b>even</b> <b>five</b> individuals studying together. It has also extended the material being studied beyond traditional texts, to modern scholarship and poetry. The Reform and Conservative movements have also altered the idea of chavurah from its Orthodox meaning of groups that meet only for Torah study. In Reform and Conservative terminology, a chavurah {{is a group of}} individuals or families which is part study or prayer group, part social club.|$|E
500|$|Cancellara was noticeably still {{recovering}} from his Milan–San Remo effort at Dwars door Vlaanderen, where he tried to attack for victory in the finale, but faded quickly and finished only 36th. The squad's best-placed rider was Posthuma in 31st. Cancellara's recovery was perhaps complete at the E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke. After a series of mechanical incidents, resulting in several wheel changes and then a whole bike change, Cancellara sped past the trailing peloton on the Oude Kwaremont climb and effortlessly bridged {{to the front of}} the race. Once there, he left even the front group on the road well behind him, winning the race by a full minute over second placed Vladimir Gusev. Cancellara said he was more impressed with this victory than when he won the same race in 2010, and analysis of his win suggested he stood as the odds-on favorite for the Tour of Flanders. Jonathan Vaughters, whose [...] team had effectively controlled the front of the race but were powerless to stop Cancellara, stated that should an on-form Cancellara ever get <b>even</b> <b>five</b> seconds' advantage at the front of a race near the end, he would likely not be seen again. Vaughters joked that rival teams would need a sniper to stop the Swiss classics specialist.|$|E

2500|$|Before long, however, a clericalizing {{tendency}} {{soon began}} to manifest itself in linguistic usage, particularly after the Council of Laodicea, whose fifteenth Canon permitted only the canonical psaltai, [...] "chanters:", to sing at the services.

2500|$|Significant coastal {{flooding}} and beach erosion affected the county. In Fort Lauderdale, the New River overflowed its banks and submerged downtown streets, {{and according to}} the local newspaper at the time, “whitecaps broke on East Las Olas Boulevard a mile (1.6km) inland.” Tides reached [...] at Hillsboro Inlet and along the coast from Fort Lauderdale northward. At Port Everglades, which reported 6.5-ft (2-m) tides, [...] two freighters were unmoored; high tides carved a channel [...] deep and rendered a nearby road impassable while nearly reopening New River Inlet, which had silted over and never re-emerged since the 1935 Yankee hurricane. High tides tore away a 150-foot-wide (45.7-m) strip of shoreline at Deerfield Beach, destroying six homes, and at Dania Beach half the oceanfront park was covered by sand.

In connection with this the Biblical quotation is quite intelligible, as according to another haggadah (Shabbat 32b; Ecclesiastes Rabbah 5:5) [...] "flesh" [...] here means children — spiritual children, pupils — whom Elisha killed with his mouth by luring them from the study of the Torah." ...|$|E
