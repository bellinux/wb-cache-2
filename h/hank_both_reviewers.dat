30|$|An {{electronic}} {{literature search}} {{was conducted by}} two independent reviewers (GMR and BE) based on the inclusion criteria in several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register databases, covering articles written in English up until January 2018.

Full articles were obtained for all the investigations deemed eligible for inclusion in this paper and further evaluated by <b>both</b> <b>reviewers.</b> If needed, a third reviewer was consulted to ensure consensus.|$|R
30|$|Again, the {{confidence}} level {{was significantly higher}} in temporal lobe epilepsy compared to extratemporal lobe epilepsy for <b>both</b> <b>reviewers</b> at a z-score threshold of 1.5 (reviewer 1 4.2 vs. 3.4, p[*]=[*] 0.002; reviewer 2 4.4 vs. 3.6, p[*]=[*] 0.001) {{as well as at}} a z-score threshold of 2 (reviewer 1 4.4 vs. 3.6, p[*]=[*] 0.001; reviewer 2 4.6 vs. 3.7, p[*]<[*] 0.001). Within these subgroups, there was a significantly higher confidence level in temporal lobe epilepsy for reviewer 1 at a z-score threshold of 2 vs. 1.5 (4.4 vs. 4.2, p[*]=[*] 0.02). Confidence levels were also higher in extratemporal lobe epilepsy for <b>both</b> <b>reviewers</b> and in temporal lobe epilepsy for reviewer 2, but these differences failed to reach significance.|$|R

50|$|Although {{created as}} a new character, Betsy {{has a great deal}} in common with Dorothy.

Betsy is more passive than Dorothy, however, and in one book even {{described}} as shy.|$|R

5000|$|The album {{received}} mixed-to-poor reviews. Flak Magazines James Norton praised it for {{the precedent}} it sets for other artists to release free music, but considers the music [...] "stuffy" [...] and lacking fun.

5000|$|The album {{received}} moderately good reviews, receiving praise or {{the stylistic}} {{range of the}} music, with Allmusic's Phil Freeman noting that [...] "The band's music surges and ebbs like a massive tide, with the guitar lines moving in a linear and horizontal", and being called [...] "a dynamic, shape-shifting beast that {{takes the form of}} a swaying ghost-like figure one minute before swelling into some sort of stone-crushing giant the next" [...] by Ryan Ogle of About.com. <b>Both</b> <b>reviewers</b> also noted similarities between the album and Neurosis's Through Silver in Blood. <b>Both</b> <b>reviewers</b> also agreed that the album was within the style that Minsk was known for, with Ogle claiming that [...] "the end result is unmistakably Minsk", though they disagreed about how much experimentation occurred within that sound. Freeman stated that [...] "while this album doesn't move Minsk's music forward in any significant way-they do what they do-it's a superb example of a band achieving total stylistic maturity", while Ogle stated that the band was [...] "charting the previously unexplored territory that is With Echoes In The Movement Of Stone".|$|R
