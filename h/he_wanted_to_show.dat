5|$|With Infinity, Townsend {{began to}} label all albums outside of Strapping Young Lad {{under his own}} name, {{dropping}} the Ocean Machine moniker, to reduce confusion. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that despite the highly varied nature of his projects, they are all simply aspects of his identity. The album Biomech was relabeled and redistributed as Ocean Machine: Biomech, under Townsend's name, to reflect the new arrangement. Townsend's bandmates began to play two sets at their shows, one as Strapping Young Lad, and one as the Devin Townsend Band, playing songs from Townsend's solo albums.|$|E
5|$|According to Tarkovsky, the {{original}} idea for a film {{about the life of}} Andrei Rublev was due to the film actor Vasily Livanov. Livanov proposed to write a screenplay together with Tarkovsky and Konchalovsky while they were strolling through a forest on the outskirts of Moscow. He also mentioned that he would love to play Andrei Rublev. Tarkovsky did not intend the film to be a historical or a biographical film about Andrei Rublev. Instead, he was motivated by the idea of showing the connection between a creative character's personality and the times through which he lives. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> an artist's maturing and the development of his talent. He chose Andrei Rublev for his importance in the history of Russian culture.|$|E
5|$|Before Live and Let Die {{had been}} published, the {{producer}} Alexander Korda had read a proof {{copy of the}} novel. He {{thought it was the}} most exciting story he had read for years, but was unsure whether it was suitable for a film. Nevertheless, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the story to the directors David Lean and Carol Reed for their impressions, although nothing came of Korda's initial interest. In 1955, following the television broadcast of an adaptation of Fleming's earlier novel Casino Royale, Warner Bros. expressed an interest in Live and Let Die, and offered $500 for an option, against $5,000 if the film was made. Fleming thought the terms insufficient and turned them down.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Neighbours {{started out}} with three {{families}} created by Watson – the Ramsays, the Robinsons and the Clarkes. Watson said that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> three families living in a small street, who are friends. Max Ramsay (Francis Bell), his wife Maria (Dasha Blahova) and their sons Shane (Peter O'Brien) and Danny (David Clencie) lived at No.24 Ramsay Street. Single father, Jim Robinson (Alan Dale) lived next door with his children, Paul (Stefan Dennis), Julie (Vikki Blanche), Scott (Darius Perkins) and Lucy (Kylie Flinker). His mother-in-law, Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy) also lived with him. Bachelor Des Clarke (Paul Keane) invited Daphne Lawrence (Elaine Smith) to live at No. 28 with him and they were later married. The Robinsons and the Ramsays {{had a long history}} in the street and they were often involved in an ongoing rivalry. When Network Ten picked up the show and revamped it, they brought in new and younger actors including Kylie Minogue as Charlene Mitchell and Jason Donovan, who replaced Darius Perkins as Scott Robinson. Many families, including the Alessi, Bishop, Hancock, Hoyland, Rebecchi, Scully, Timmins and Willis families have moved {{in and out of the}} street over the years.|$|E
5|$|Originally, EVE {{would have}} been {{electrocuted}} by Auto, and then be quickly saved from ejection {{at the hands of}} the WALL-A robots by WALL-E. He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from Earth. Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening, as <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> EVE replacing her directive of bringing the plant to the captain with repairing WALL-E, and it made WALL-E even more heroic if he held the holo-detector open despite being badly hurt. Stanton also moved the moment where WALL-E reveals his plant (which he had snatched from the self-destructing escape pod) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape, as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around the ship. Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died out after the film's end. Jim Capobianco, director of the Ratatouille short film Your Friend the Rat, created an end credits animation that continued the story—and stylized in different artistic movements throughout history—to clarify an optimistic tone.|$|E
5|$|Posehn had a {{difficult}} time working within the Genesis's output resolution of 320×240. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> as much of the playing field as possible without losing the details of the sprites; he felt a lack of graphical detail would make them less interesting. Posehn developed a dynamic camera system to help maintain what he felt was the right balance between the size of the field in view {{and the size of the}} game objects. The camera travels on an elliptic curve as the helicopter rotates to change the direction it travels; this puts whatever is in front of the helicopter more in view on screen. Posehn also integrated momentum to the camera movements to smooth transitions. He spent several months working on the physics for the screen and helicopter to ensure realistic movement. Instead of using completely accurate physics, Posehn chose to model movement that he believed players would assume a helicopter would have. He believed players would be put off by physics that didn't match their perceived movement.|$|E

50|$|From {{the project}} ‘Culture of the Confrontation’, 2013-2014, Dondyuk’s {{perception}} of photography has changed. He began filling his works with second meaning and associational level. <b>He</b> doesn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> specify the time period, {{the place and}} reasons. Through photography <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> eternal themes, <b>wants</b> people <b>to</b> associate his works with their memories from reading books, music, their own life.|$|R
5|$|The show's storylines {{concern the}} {{domestic}} and professional {{lives of the}} people who live and work in Erinsborough, a fictional suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. The series primarily centres on the residents of Ramsay Street, a short cul-de-sac, and its neighbouring area, the Lassiters complex, which includes a bar, hotel, cafe, police station, lawyers' office and park. Neighbours began with three families created by Watson – the Ramsays, the Robinsons and the Clarkes. Watson said that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> three families who are friends living in a small street. The Robinsons and the Ramsays had a long history and were involved in an ongoing rivalry. Pin Oak Court, in Vermont South, is the real cul-de-sac that has doubled for Ramsay Street since 1985. All of the houses featured are real and the residents allow the production to shoot external scenes in their yards. The interior scenes are filmed at the Global Television studios in Forest Hill.|$|E

25|$|One {{of the few}} cornerers whose {{rationale}} {{was published}} and justified, Cornelius Vanderbilt started accumulating shares of the Harlem Railroad in 1862 because he anticipated its strategic value. He {{took control of the}} Harlem Railroad and later explained that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that he could take this railroad, which was generally considered worthless, and make it valuable. The corner of June 25, 1863 can be seen as just an episode in a strategic investment that served the public well.|$|E

Fuller admits in {{one place}} that this is [...] "egostistical" [...] (p. 378), but excuses this by saying that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> not just his conclusions, but also the thought {{processes}} that led to them.

He then takes Sophia to an old rundown building where he used to live, and finds the flipbooks <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> her, but Sophia gets scared and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> go home.|$|R
25|$|Raymont {{said that}} the series and the issues in the show are drawn from issues that {{currently}} face Canada {{and the rest of}} the world such as 9/11, the Darfur Crisis, human rights violations in China and trans-national crimes such as pedophiles and international crime rings. He also said that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the Canadian perspective in facing national security issues that would affect the country. Raymont wanted to show viewers that Canadians are more understanding and open-minded than the Americans are.|$|E
25|$|The film then {{depicts the}} grandfather's {{struggle}} {{to accept the}} reality {{that the only way}} to save his grandson is at the cost of his eyesight. He tries to come to terms with the situation and his personal agony is shown in scenes, like taking second opinion, explaining his grandson the reality and his desire to show him everything possible before his grandson loses his eyesight. For some reason, the surgery has to be postponed by a day. That afternoon, grandfather and grandson disappear from the hospital ward and a frantic search follows. Confronted by an angry surgeon on their return, the grandfather states quite simply that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> Parshya the sights of the city for one last time.|$|E
25|$|Rumors about Square Enix {{beginning}} {{development on}} a remake appeared in 2014, apparently coming from an industry insider source. Remake was officially {{announced at the}} 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo during the PlayStation conference: the announcement received a standing ovation from the audience. The announcement trailer was created by Visual Works. Square Enix's stock prices rose {{in the wake of}} the announcement to their highest rating since November 2008, and the YouTube release of the reveal trailer garnered over 10 million views within the following two weeks.

[...] Guillén accepts reality for what it is and <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> what <b>he</b> has in common with other humans in the timeless experience of being.

500|$|The rabbit hunt {{scene is}} often {{compared}} to the senseless death that occurs during war; Renoir said <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> a certain class of people killing for no reason. Renoir himself had never killed an animal and called hunting [...] "an abominable exercise in cruelty." [...] Bergan saw the analogy to world events and wrote [...] "in the great set piece of the hunt, the callous cruelty of the guests is laid bare as they fire at any rabbit and bird that moves after the beaters have led the game to slaughter." ...|$|E

[...] On October 2009, Brown released screencaps for the video, coincidentally the same day Rihanna released her video for [...] "Russian Roulette".
