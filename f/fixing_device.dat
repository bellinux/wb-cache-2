5000|$|The fourteenth {{episode of}} the anime {{introduces}} Misty Honey, a rival and self-proclaimed twin sister of Cutie Honey, whose name was chosen through a contest in Japan. Ironically, Misty Honey {{was one of her}} alter-egos in the original cartoon. Misty Honey, unlike Cutie Honey, cannot turn into anyone she wants; she can only change to Misty Honey. She has a band around her thigh that resembles Honey's choker which acts as the activator for her Airborne Element <b>Fixing</b> <b>Device</b> but she uses a ring to transform with the words [...] "Honey Flash". Seira's heart was [...] "poisoned" [...] by Panther Zora when she was found by Twilight Prince. The darkness in her heart (and her flawed transformation device) creates Panther Claw minions. Later in the series, it is revealed that Honey and Seira were two survivors of a series of artificially created humans that were created to possess the Element Changing Device created by her father and Twilight Prince under Panther Claw before professor Kisaragi personally terminated the project. After the destruction of the incubation machine, Professor Kisaragi found and raised Honey as his own while Seira was taken in by Twilight Prince and Panther Zora. Her alter ego, Seira Hazuki, shares her given name with Seiji and Honey's child, who appears only in the 39th and final episode.|$|E

In the last decades, metal forming gained attention of the researchers and considerable changes has occurred. Because for {{a small number of}} parts, the conventional metal forming processes are expensive and time-consuming in terms of designing and manufacturing preparation, the manufacturers and researchers became interested in flexible processes. One of the most investigated flexible processes in metal forming is incremental sheet forming (ISF). ISF is an advanced flexible manufacturing process which allows to manufacture complex 3 D products without expensive dedicated tools. In most of the cases it is needed for an ISF process the following: a simple tool, a <b>fixing</b> <b>device</b> for sheet metal blank and a universal CNC machine.
