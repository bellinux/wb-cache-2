500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Lepiota castaneidisca have white, {{bell-shaped}} to convex caps [...] in diameter, with an orange-reddish to pale orange-brown center. Mature specimens fade and lose the reddish shades. The cap surface develops small pale pink or cream patches (especially on the outermost zone) {{on a white}} background that has radially arranged [...] The gills are somewhat crowded to moderately distant, with typically 40–45 full length gills, and 1–5 tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem). They are slightly ventricose, measuring 2.5–5mm wide, and have a white fringed or <b>irregular</b> <b>edge.</b> Whitish when young and cream-colored in age, they have a free gill attachment to the stem. [...] The stem is [...] long by [...] thick, cylindrical, slightly widened at the base, hollow, and [...] Its color is pinkish in the lower part, and it stains reddish where damaged, especially in older specimens. The flesh is whitish, sometimes with cream tones, or reddish-brown in mature specimens. There is a ring that points upward in young specimens, but in maturity it degrades to remnants that are left behind on the stem. It has a sharp odor similar to rubber or cod liver oil. [...] The mushroom is not known to be poisonous, but consumption is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} possible confusion with Lepiota species that contain deadly amatoxins.|$|E

50|$|The rim of this crater is {{worn and}} eroded, {{and it has}} a {{somewhat}} <b>irregular</b> <b>edge</b> in places. The inner wall is wider along the western side, where the rim has a slight outward bulge. The most intact portion of the rim lies along the eastern side, and the inner wall of this face is visible from the Earth.|$|E
50|$|The outer rim of Antoniadi is {{generally}} circular, with an <b>irregular</b> <b>edge</b> that has multiple indentations {{all about the}} perimeter. The wall is only lightly eroded, and retains a crisp rim and terracing on the inner walls. Only a single small craterlet of note lies across the interior wall, near the southeast edge of the rim.|$|E
50|$|The rim of Mercurius is circular, with a {{somewhat}} <b>irregular</b> <b>edge.</b> There are small outward bulges along several {{sections of the}} rim, with the most notable bulges being along the eastern and southern sides. The inner wall has slumped around much of the perimeter, producing a sharp edge. The sides are also somewhat worn, with some tiny craterlets overlying the inner wall.|$|E

50|$|The {{shape of}} the body is {{elongate}} and narrow. Rhinophoral sheaths are elevated with an <b>irregular</b> <b>edge.</b> Cerata are relatively short and branched. Edge of the oral veil is with relatively long appendages. Rhinophores are long and branched. Background color is translucent gray with a distinctive reticulate network of opaque white across the dorsum. It is up to 11 mm long.|$|E
5000|$|The fruit bodies (basidiocarps) of H. occidentale are {{its most}} {{identifying}} feature. It {{is a small}} shelf or [...] "conk" [...] with an <b>irregular</b> <b>edge</b> with white spore tubes on the underneath. The basidiocarp is perennial and the top layer will form layering edges that are dark yellow to brown. Basidiocarps tend to form near the forest floor of affected trees and may be hidden in the forest duff.|$|E
50|$|Unlike most crustaceans, {{barnacles}} {{are unable}} to move from place to place. Cement glands near {{the base of the}} antennae fix them to the rock. The carapace of this species is conical with a circular base which has an <b>irregular</b> <b>edge</b> and a diameter of up to three centimetres. The surface is ridged and white or pale brown. The cover plates protecting the opening are shaped like the beak of a bird.|$|E
50|$|Those are manual dermatomes and {{the term}} knife or scalpel {{is used to}} {{describe}} them. Their disadvantages are harvesting of grafts with <b>irregular</b> <b>edges</b> and grafts of variable thickness. Their operator has to be experienced in their use for optimal results.|$|R
50|$|Several {{other small}} craters lie across the {{interior}} floor, including a grouping {{to the south}} of the midpoint. The rim has an outward bulge along the southeast side and <b>irregular</b> <b>edges</b> to the north and south. A small crater lies along the western inner wall.|$|R
5000|$|It is a bulb-forming {{perennial}} which spreads {{by means}} of underground rhizomes. It has narrow, yellowish-green leaves; broadly funnel-shaped staminal corona, with <b>irregular</b> <b>edges.</b> Each plant produces only two flowers, one opening slightly earlier than the other, each one white with a green eye.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{formation}} {{that has seen}} better days. The outer rim has been bombarded by a myriad of lesser impacts, producing an eroded and <b>irregular</b> <b>edge.</b> Attached to the outher rim to the northeast is the satellite crater Vernadskiy B, an equally worn crater. The interior floor of Vernadskiy is also marked {{by a number of}} small impacts, although in general it is more level than the uneven terrain that surrounds the crater.|$|E
50|$|Because it overlies D'Alembert, Slipher is {{a younger}} {{formation}} {{and it has}} undergone much less erosion. The rim is circular but has a somewhat <b>irregular</b> <b>edge.</b> The rim is jumbled and irregular where it intersects D'Alembert. Overlapping the western rim and inner walls of Slipher is the smaller Slipher S, a fresh feature with a sharp-edged outer rim. The interior floor of Slipher is somewhat uneven except in the northeast, {{and there is a}} cluster of low central ridges near the midpoint.|$|E
50|$|Chappell is a lunar crater that {{is located}} {{on the far side of}} the Moon, in the {{northern}} hemisphere just to the north of the crater Debye. This feature is located in a heavily bombarded section of the surface, and much of the outer rim of the crater is overlain by many smaller craters. The northern rim in particular has been almost completely disintegrated, while small craters also overlie the rim to the northwest and southeast. What remains of the rim forms a rounded, somewhat <b>irregular</b> <b>edge</b> to the crater depression.|$|E
30|$|Suturing of the ovarian edges was {{required}} in two patients as the ovarian tissue had <b>irregular</b> <b>edges,</b> and reconstruction {{was not possible}} otherwise. None of the patients required conversion to laparotomy. No intraoperative or postoperative complication occurred. Length of postoperative stay was 1  day (1 – 4).|$|R
50|$|A third {{category}} is architecture in landscape. Bryden’s background {{as an architect}} comes through in these works, but his depictions have a rich style that uses the light, <b>irregular</b> <b>edges,</b> and {{the texture of the}} paint to portray the building’s character, rather than a strict draftsman-style representation of the form.|$|R
50|$|Double deckers: Double decker puzzles {{are made}} up of {{multiple}} layers that sit on top of one another. <b>Irregular</b> <b>edges</b> and dropouts highlight the imagery in interesting ways. Some double decker puzzles include very simple tricks—swappable image areas. For example, the Snow White limited edition allows you to swap the Evil Queen and Snow White in the mirror.|$|R
5000|$|Elm cockscomb gall: these {{distinct}} galls, {{caused by}} an aphid, are about one inch long and about 1/4 inch high. The <b>irregular</b> <b>edge</b> of the gall and its red color at maturity account for the common name. The galls dry, harden and turn brown as they age. Aphids may be seen through a slit-like opening in {{the underside of the}} gall. This insect has a complex life cycle—it forms galls on elm in early summer, then feeds on grass roots later in the summer. The galls apparently do not cause significant harm to the tree.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 19 mm. The forewings are dark fuscous with a slender whitish-yellow median streak {{from the base}} to one-fourth and the extreme costal edge whitish towards the middle. There is a transverse ochreous-whitish postmedian streak, with the extremities bent outwards and indistinct. The hindwings are iridescent-blue-hyaline with the veins dark fuscous and with a dark fuscous costal band, continued as a broad fascia around the apex and rapidly narrowed with an <b>irregular</b> <b>edge</b> {{to the middle of}} the termen, then slender to the tornus, with acute projections on the submedian and subdorsal folds.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{a nearly}} {{circular}} crater {{with a sharp}} but somewhat <b>irregular</b> <b>edge</b> {{that has not been}} significantly eroded. There are some terraces, particularly along the southwestern inner walls, and some slumping along the southeastern rim. The interior floor has been flooded by basaltic lava, leaving a dark, level interior. There are no breaks in the exterior rim where the lava could have entered the crater, so it was presumably flooded from below. The floor is marked only by a few tiny craterlets. Surrounding Jenner is a [...] of ejecta that extends for over a half crater diameter in some directions.|$|E
50|$|Five {{specimens}} {{were recovered}} at this site. A perform is an incomplete and unused basic {{form of a}} stone tool These specimens exhibit unpatterned bifacial flaking with deep scars and <b>irregular</b> <b>edges.</b> Average size is 52mm by 12 mm. The presence of preforms at Vail Pass Camp suggests an emphasis on final stage tool production as the main characteristic of the lithic technology.|$|R
50|$|In culture, M. gallinae {{produces}} a white, satiny colony. The colony appears flat with radial folds and <b>irregular</b> <b>edges</b> as it grows in culture The colony reverse {{produces a}} strong pigmentation that changes from pink {{to a deep}} red and diffuses through the growth medium. Optimal growth of M. gallinae occurs at 26-28 °C, and no special nutritional requirements are necessary for its growth. Additionally, M. gallinae is urease positive.|$|R

50|$|The {{shape of}} the body {{elongate}} and narrow. Rhinophoral sheaths are elevated with an <b>irregular</b> <b>edge.</b> Cerata are short and branched. Edge of the oral veil is with relatively long appendages. Rhinophores ar long and branched. Background color is translucent gray {{with a series of}} irregular, longitudinal, thin white lines that run {{along the length of the}} dorsum. Its colour, pink or pale lavender, matches the colour of its host sea fan, Gorgonia ventalina. There are about twenty thin white stripes running the length of the body. There are series of nine, sparsely pinnate, gills down each side of the body. Tritonia hamnerorum is up to 15 mm long.|$|E
5000|$|This crater {{retains a}} {{well-defined}} form {{that has not}} changed significantly since it was originally created. The outer rim edge is roughly circular, but with a somewhat <b>irregular</b> <b>edge</b> that displays signs of slumping. The most notable slump is a triangular area along the eastern rim. The inner wall of the crater has a complex system of terraces with a sharp-edged rim in locations where slumping has occurred. On {{the exterior of the}} rim is an outer [...] that extends outwards for nearly half a crater diameter in all directions. The crater has a ray system, and is consequently mapped as part of the Copernican System.|$|E

25|$|Melanoma, {{also known}} as {{malignant}} melanoma, {{is a type of}} cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. In women they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men they are most common on the back. Sometimes they develop from a mole with concerning changes including an increase in size, <b>irregular</b> <b>edges,</b> change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown.|$|R
