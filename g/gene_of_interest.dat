40|$|Abstract A {{statistically}} {{robust and}} biologically-based approach {{for analysis of}} microarray data is described that integrates independent biological knowledge and data with a global F-test for finding <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> that minimizes the need for replicates when used for hypothesis generation. First, each microarray is normalized to its noise level around zero. The microarray dataset is then globally adjusted by robust linear regression. Second, <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> that capture significant responses to experimental conditions are selected by finding those that express significantly higher variance than those expressing only technical variability. Clustering expression data and identifying expression-independent properties <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> including upstream transcriptional regulatory elements (TREs), ontologies and networks or pathways organizes the data into a biologically meaningful system. We demonstrate that when the number <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is inconveniently large, identifying a subset of "beacon genes" representing the largest changes will identify pathways or networks altered by biological manipulation. The entire dataset is then used to complete the picture outlined by the "beacon genes.

We illustrate this approach by comparing cells cultured on plastic or an extracellular matrix which organizes a dataset of over 2, 000 <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> from a genome wide scan of transcription.

The genetic engineering technique fuses the <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to the GFP gene.

25|$|The {{starting}} gene can be mutagenised {{by random}} point mutations (by chemical mutagens or error prone PCR) and insertions and deletions (by transposons). Gene recombination can be mimicked by DNA shuffling of several sequences (usually {{of more than}} 70% homology) to jump into regions of sequence space between the shuffled parent genes. Finally, specific regions of a gene can be systematically randomised for a more focused approach based on structure and function knowledge. Depending on the method, the library generated will vary {{in the proportion of}} functional variants it contains. Even if an organism is used to express the <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> by mutagenising only that gene, the rest of the organism’s genome remains the same and can be ignored for the evolution experiment (to the extent of providing a constant genetic environment).|$|E
25|$|Genetically {{modified}} mice are {{the most}} common animal model for transgenic research. Transgenic mice are currently being used to study a variety of diseases including cancer, obesity, heart disease, arthritis, anxiety, and Parkinson’s disease. The two most common types of genetically modified mice are knockout mice and oncomice. Knockout mice are a type of mouse model that uses transgenic insertion to disrupt an existing gene’s expression. In order to create knockout mice, a transgene with the desired sequence is inserted into an isolated mouse blastocyst using electroporation. Then, homologous recombination occurs naturally within some cells, replacing the <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> with the designed transgene. Through this process, researchers were able to demonstrate that a transgene can be integrated into the genome of an animal, serve a specific function within the cell, and be passed down to future generations.|$|E

If validation of transcript isoforms is required, an inspection of RNA-Seq read alignments should indicate where qPCR primers might be placed for maximum discrimination. The measurement of multiple control genes along with the genes of interest produces a stable reference within a biological context. qPCR validation of RNA-Seq data has generally shown that different RNA-Seq methods are highly correlated.|$|E

This method has the benefits of being more versatile in the selection conditions (e.g. temperature, solvent), and can express proteins that would be toxic to cells. Furthermore, in vitro evolution experiments can generate far larger libraries (up to 1015) because the library DNA need not be inserted into cells (often a limiting step).|$|E

Cas9 is able to initiate a double strand break and the λ-red system is able to bring the linear DNA to E. coli genome for homologous recombination. The cells are then cured of the plasmid containing the specific sgRNA and then the next plasmid containing the specific sgRNA target sequence can be transformed and the process is repeated.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In recent years, {{studies have}} {{increasingly}} {{pointed to a}} number of different mechanisms that potentially form the foundation for the neurodegenerative pathology seen in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). One such mechanism is neural damage due to oxidative stress. This study attempted to identify significantly altered expression levels <b>of</b> particular <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> between PTSD and control groups, as well as between PTSD samples and samples exhibiting commonly seen PTSD comorbidities, major depressive disorder (MDD), and depressive disorder not otherwise specified (DepNOS). The <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> being pursued in the study encompass the production of reactive oxygen species, such as inflammatory response mechanisms, the processes that control the removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and genes that are activated in response to oxidative stress. Other <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> involve factors important in the structural integrity of the prefrontal cortex, such as junction proteins, the blood-brain barrier, such as aquaporins, and neuronal integrity. These genes were included due to the evidence of structural degeneration in PTSD patients. A total <b>of</b> 54 <b>genes</b> were tested in all four groups. OBJECTIVES: To identify and determine genetic differences amongst individuals with PTSD in comparison to non-PTSD sufferers, and sufferers of common PTSD comorbidities. METHODS: The expression levels <b>of</b> the <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> were measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) techniques. RNA is extracted and collected from tissues samples of deceased military PTSD patients from the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex derived RNA is used as the experimental samples, due to the prevalence of the pathology of PTSD in this region. Complimentary DNA (cDNA) is reverse transcribed from the collected RNA, and then products <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> are amplified during the qPCR reaction using specifically designed primers. The expression level <b>of</b> the <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> were then compared to the ubiquitously expressed gene 18 s for normalization calculations. Genetic expression levels in the PTSD, MDD, and DepNOS cohorts were then normalized to the expression of non-PTSD controls. RESULTS: <b>Of</b> the 54 <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> analyzed, two <b>genes,</b> NQO 1 and IL- 6, exhibited significantly decreased and increased levels of expression in comparison to the control group, respectively (p < 0. 05). Alongside this, NQO 1 showed significantly decreased expression in comparison to the DepNOS cohort, while IL- 6 exhibited significantly increased expression in comparison to the MDD cohort (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Two genes involved with the production and elimination of reactive oxygen species were identified with having significantly altered levels of expression. NQO 1, which facilitates the removal of ROS was shown to have significantly lower expression when compared to the control group, indicating an inhibited ability to remove ROS readily. Furthermore, IL- 6, a proinflammatory cytokine and a promotor of ROS production, exhibited significantly increased expression, indicating a potential increase in ROS formation. Together these results indicate a potential mechanism for the production and accumulation of ROS in patients with PTSD, leading to the observed neurodegeneration. 2018 - 07 - 11 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R
