5|$|Next Stace {{explains}} {{that there are}} two orders of being: time (or the world) and eternity (or God), and these intersect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> of mystic illumination. He maintains these orders are distinct, so one order cannot dictate to the other. Here he says that he agrees with Kant, who made a distinction between the world of phenomena and the noumenon, although he is critical of Kant’s disregard for mystical experience.|$|E
5|$|The book {{begins by}} looking at religion, {{specifically}} God as non-being and as being, put by Stace as the negative and positive divine. Stace then defines two orders of being - time and eternity, which he says intersect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> of mystic illumination. He {{goes on to say}} that the nature of God or eternity is such that all religious language is symbolic and that it is necessarily subject to contradictions.|$|E
60|$|It is not <b>the</b> enemy <b>in</b> {{front that}} I fear, but the {{division}} which too often makes itself manifest in progressive ranks--it is that division, that dispersion of forces, that internecine struggle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> of great emergency, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> when <b>the</b> issue hangs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> balance--it is that which, I fear, may weaken our efforts and may perhaps deprive us of success otherwise within our grasp.|$|R

5|$|Whedon {{was also}} keen on {{utilizing}} vertical space; thus, having the crew's quarters accessible by ladder was important. Another {{benefit of the}} set design was that it also allowed the actors to stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> and interact, without having to stop after each shot and reset up for the next. This helped contribute to the documentary style Whedon strove for.|$|E
5|$|The bells {{that draw}} the knights to the Grail {{ceremony}} at Monsalvat in acts 1 and 3 have often proved problematic to stage. For the earlier performances of Parsifal in Bayreuth, Wagner had the Parsifal bell, a piano frame with four strings, constructed {{as a substitute}} for church bells. For the first performances, the bells were combined with tam-tam and gongs. However, the bell was used with the tuba, four tam-tams tuned to the pitch of the four chime notes and another tam-tam on which a roll is executed by using a drumstick. In modern-day performances, the Parsifal bell has been replaced with tubular bells or synthesizers to produce the desired notes. The thunder machine is used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> of the destruction of Klingsor's castle.|$|E
5|$|This {{problem is}} not {{exclusive}} to electric vehicles. In 2007 research at the Technical University Munich showed that ordinary vehicles in background noise are often detected too late for safe accident avoidance. The researchers measured the distances of 35 approaching vehicles to a pedestrian <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> when they just got audible in a stationary background noise. These distances were then compared to the stopping distances of the respective cars and an algorithm was proposed to estimate them based on auditory masking.|$|E

5|$|The 3D cutscenes were {{improved}} with motion capture technology {{to create a}} more cinematic experience. The stylized comic-like cut scenes from the first game carried over into the sequel, though they were reserved for bigger moments in the game. The 3D cutscenes were used to tell the story going on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> while the comic-like cutscenes were used to tell a large piece of the story in a short amount of time. In addition to the cut scenes, the moral element of the original also transferred to the sequel. When incorporating the player's Karma decisions from the first game into the second, it was found challenging to balance the effects of importing saves from the original Infamous and keeping the game interesting for those who did not. The melee combat in the game was redesigned from the original with finishing moves being added. A large focus on the melee combat was the presentation, which was meant to make the player feel super-powered.|$|E

40|$|An {{example is}} {{described}} in which an asymptotically flat static vacuum Weyl space-time experiences a sudden change across a null hypersurface <b>in</b> <b>the</b> multipole <b>moments</b> of its isolated axially symmetric source. A light–like shell and an impulsive gravitational wave are identified, both having the null hypersurface as history. <b>The</b> stress–energy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shell is dominated (at large distance from the source) by <b>the</b> jump <b>in</b> <b>the</b> monopole <b>moment</b> (<b>the</b> mass) of the source with <b>the</b> jump <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dipole <b>moment</b> mainly responsible for the stress being anisotropic. The gravitational wave owes its existence principally to <b>the</b> jump <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quadrupole <b>moment</b> of <b>the</b> source confirming what would be expected.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> {{distribution}} method, every {{joint of}} the structure to be analysed is fixed so as to develop the fixed-end moments. Then each fixed joint is sequentially released and the fixed-end moments (which {{by the time of}} release are not in equilibrium) are distributed to adjacent members until equilibrium is achieved. The moment distribution method in mathematical terms can be demonstrated as the process of solving a set of simultaneous equations by means of iteration.|$|E
25|$|Throughout 1938 the {{principal}} if not exclusive source of new men was a draft; {{at this stage}} it was the Republicans who conscripted more aggressively. In {{the middle of the}} year, just prior to the Battle of Ebro, the Republicans achieved their all-time high, commanding an army of slightly above 800,000; this was already no match for the Nationalists, who numbered 880,000. The Battle of Ebro, fall of Catalonia and collapsing discipline produced a massive shrinking of the Republican troops. In late February 1939 their army was 400,000 compared to more than double that number of Nationalists. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> of their final victory, the latter commanded over 900,000 troops.|$|E
25|$|In {{fact the}} essence of her art was refinement. The term seems odd for a {{performer}} whose imagination and means of expression were so prodigious. She was eminently capable of the grand gesture; still, judging strictly from the evidence of her recordings, we know (and her few existing film clips confirm) that her power flowed not from excess but from unbroken concentration, unfaltering truth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment.</b> It flowed also from irreproachable musicianship. People say that Callas would not hesitate to distort a vocal line for dramatic effect. In the throes of operatic passion plenty of singers snarl, growl, whine, and shriek. Callas {{was not one of}} them. She found all she needed in the notes.|$|E

25|$|In the beginning, {{the great}} God Zurvan existed alone. Desiring {{offspring}} {{that would create}} “heaven and hell and everything in between”, Zurvan sacrificed for a thousand years. Towards {{the end of this}} period, androgyne Zurvan began to doubt the efficacy of sacrifice and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> of this doubt Ohrmuzd and Ahriman were conceived: Ohrmuzd for the sacrifice and Ahriman for the doubt. Upon realizing that twins were to be born, Zurvan resolved to grant the first-born sovereignty over creation. Ohrmuzd perceived Zurvan’s decision, which He then communicated to His brother. Ahriman then preempted Ohrmuzd by ripping open the womb to emerge first. Reminded of the resolution to grant Ahriman sovereignty, Zurvan conceded, but limited kingship to a period of 9000years, after which Ohrmuzd would rule for all eternity (Zaehner, 1955:419-428).|$|E
25|$|The {{season finale}} {{required}} numerous computer-generated imagery. At {{the start of}} the episode, Jor-El's disembodied voice talks to Clark through the spaceship. For this scene, Entity FX created a completely computer-generated model of the ship, because the ship had to transform into multiple objects as the scene progressed, creating it digitally was the best option. Later in the episode, when Clark refuses to leave Smallville, Jor-El brands him with a Kryptonian tattoo. Brian Harding worked on the tattoo that is placed on Clark's chest, creating an effect {{based on the idea that}} it appeared to burn from the inside. For the same scene, Beck and his team had to digitally create a bare chest for Welling's stunt double, who had to wear a shirt to hide the safety harness he was wearing when they dropped him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> Clark is released from the ship's hold.|$|E
25|$|Frontman Justin Pierre {{composed}} the lyrics for Go, which is themed around mortality, growing older, {{and learning to}} live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment.</b> The reflective tone includes subjects such as procrastination, relationship miscommunication, and optimism, but also personal struggles such as the death of loved ones. Many songs on Go were developed over years at a time, and several date to the band's first few studio albums. Musically, the album retains the band's pop-rock, Moog-based sound, with a heavier emphasis on electronic experimentation. Following the album's recording, the band entered talks with Epitaph Records, where they were signed from 2003 to 2008. Discussions with label founder Brett Gurewitz led the band to re-sign with Epitaph, who co-released Go alongside the band's own label, The Boombox Generation. It is the final album by the band to feature long-time drummer Tony Thaxton before he announced his departure on March, 20th, 2013.|$|E
