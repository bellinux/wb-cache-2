25|$|G. aurea was {{initially}} discovered and described by Augustin Saint-Hilaire in 1833 {{with four other}} Brazilian species. Darwin took note of G. aurea in his 1875 manuscript, <b>Insectivorous</b> <b>Plants.</b> Recent study {{has focused on the}} carnivorous nature of G. aurea. At least two published sources note the variety within the species and genus and are optimistic that additional species will be located.|$|E
25|$|Carnivorous {{plants are}} plants that derive some {{or most of}} their {{nutrients}} (but not energy) from trapping and consuming animals or protozoans, typically insects and other arthropods. Carnivorous plants have adapted to grow in places where the soil is thin or poor in nutrients, especially nitrogen, such as acidic bogs and rock outcroppings. Charles Darwin wrote <b>Insectivorous</b> <b>Plants,</b> the first well-known treatise on carnivorous plants, in 1875.|$|E

25|$|Ralfs aided in {{the botanical}} {{portions}} of the Guide to Ilfracombe, 1838; the Guide to Penzance, by J. S. Courtney, 1845; the Week at the Land's End, by John Thomas Blight, 1861; the Official Guide to Penzance, 1876, and he supplied the list of desmids to Jenner's Flora of Tunbridge Wells. He sent many plants for description in the second edition of English Botany by Sir James Edward Smith. Berkeley gave the name of Ralfsia to a genus of seaweeds, and Wilson named a Jungermannia in his honour. Charles Darwin in his <b>Insectivorous</b> <b>Plants</b> gracefully referred to those supplied to him by Ralfs from the neighbourhood of Penzance.|$|E
500|$|His evolution-related {{experiments}} and investigations led to books on Orchids, <b>Insectivorous</b> <b>Plants,</b> The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom, {{different forms of}} flowers on plants of the same species, and The Power of Movement in Plants. His botanical work was interpreted and popularised by various writers including Grant Allen and H. G. Wells, and [...] in the late C19 and early C20. In his last book he returned to The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms.|$|E
500|$|After On the Origin of Species was published, Darwin became {{involved}} in producing revised editions as well as working on Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication as {{the first part of}} his planned [...] "Big Book". By the spring of 1860 he had tired of the grind of writing, and needed something fresh and interesting to study. During a family visit to relatives at Hartfield, he was searching for orchids when he noticed a sundew. He collected it and tried to feed it insects, thus beginning a long-term study of <b>insectivorous</b> <b>plants.</b> He investigated other botanical questions raised by his ideas of natural selection, including the advantages of sexual dimorphism in primulas, and the adaptive mechanisms that ensure cross-pollination in orchids. As an enthusiastic practical scientist, such investigations gave him a strong sense of personal enjoyment. He relished pitting his wits against nature, and following lucky hunches. His theory was a {{way of looking at the}} world, enabling him to find creative solutions to problems that traditional approaches could not solve. He later wrote, [...] "I am like a gambler, & love a wild experiment." ...|$|E
50|$|The Journal of <b>Insectivorous</b> <b>Plant</b> Society (Shokuchūshokubutsu kenkyū-kai kaishi) is a {{quarterly}} Japanese-language periodical {{and the official}} publication of the <b>Insectivorous</b> <b>Plant</b> Society of Japan. The journal was established in January 1950. As of 2010, it is published in A4 format and totals around 120 pages annually. The English title has been used alongside the original Japanese one from the April 1986 issue onwards.|$|R

2500|$|The machair {{is noted}} for {{different}} species of orchid and associated vegetation such as various grasses. Three heathers; ling, bell heather and cross-leaved heather are predominant in the large areas of moorland vegetation which also holds large numbers of <b>insectivorous</b> <b>plants</b> such as sundews. The expanse of heather-covered moorland explains the name Eilean an Fhraoich, Gaelic for [...] "The Heather Isle".|$|E

60|$|The {{researches}} thus initiated led to {{the proof}} that plants are capable of secreting a digestive fluid like that of animals, and of profiting by the result of digestion; whereby the peculiar apparatuses of the <b>insectivorous</b> <b>plants</b> were brought {{within the scope of}} natural selection. Moreover, these inquiries widely enlarged our knowledge of the manner in which stimuli are transmitted in plants, and opened up a prospect of drawing closer the analogies between the motor processes of plants and those of animals.|$|E
60|$|The {{singular}} circumstance {{observed by}} Meyer, that the Torula of yeast, though an indubitable plant, still flourishes most vigorously when supplied with the complex nitrogenous substance, pepsin; {{the probability that}} the Peronospora is nourished directly by the protoplasm of the potato-plant; and the wonderful facts which have recently been brought to light respecting <b>insectivorous</b> <b>plants,</b> all favour this view; and tend {{to the conclusion that the}} difference between animal and plant is one of degree rather than of kind, and that the problem whether, in a given case, an organism is an animal or a plant, may be essentially insoluble.|$|E
60|$|Although little {{acquainted with}} {{biological}} science, Whewell {{seems to have}} taken particular pains with that part of his work which deals with the history of geological and biological speculation; and several chapters of his seventeenth and eighteenth books, which comprise the history of physiology, of comparative anatomy and of the palætiological sciences, vividly reproduce the controversies of {{the early days of the}} Victorian epoch. But here, as in the case of the doctrine of the conservation of energy, the historian of the inductive sciences has no prophetic insight; not even a suspicion of that which the near future was to bring forth. And those who still repeat the once favorite objection that Darwin's 'Origin of Species' is nothing but a new version of the 'Philosophie zoologique' will find that, so late as 1844, Whewell had not the slightest suspicion of Darwin's main theorem, even as a logical possibility. In fact, the publication of that theorem by Darwin and Wallace, in 1859, took all the biological world by surprise. Neither those who were inclined towards the 'progressive transmutation' or 'development' doctrine, as it was then called, nor those who were opposed to it, had the slightest suspicion that the tendency to variation in living beings, which all admitted as a matter of fact; the selective influence of conditions, which no one could deny to be a matter of fact, when his attention was drawn to the evidence; and the occurrence of great geological changes which also was matter of fact; could be used as the only necessary postulates of a theory of the evolution of plants and animals which, even if not at once, competent to explain all the known facts of biological science, could not be shown to be inconsistent with any. So far as biology is concerned, the publication of the 'Origin of Species,' for the first time, put the doctrine of evolution, in its application to living things, upon a sound scientific foundation. It became an instrument of investigation, and in no hands did it prove more brilliantly profitable than in those of Darwin himself. His publications on the effects of domestication in plants and animals, on the influence of cross-fertilisation, on flowers as organs for effecting such fertilisation, on <b>insectivorous</b> <b>plants,</b> on the motions of plants, pointed out the routes of exploration which have since been followed by hosts of inquirers, to the great profit of science.|$|E
