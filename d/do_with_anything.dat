25|$|Spinoza’s second {{knowledge}} involves reasoning plus emotions. He {{explains that}} this knowledge is had by the rationality of any adequate causes {{that have to}} <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> common to the human mind. An example of this could be anything that is classified as being of imperfect virtue. Imperfect virtues are seen as those which are incomplete. Many philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle, would compare imperfect virtue to pagan virtue.|$|E
25|$|Interscope gave us, like, {{a million}} bucks last year, and we built a {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't do too well with Pummel, so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us. I think the thing they didn't realize, and we did realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. They thought they could market {{it because it was}} the right music, but the fact of it is that the music doesn't have anything to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything,</b> really. We knew that.|$|E
500|$|Western astrology {{has taken}} the earth's axial {{precession}} (also called precession of the equinoxes) into account since Ptolemy's Almagest, so the 'first point of Aries', {{the start of the}} astrological year, continually moves against the background of the stars. The tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars, and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated sign, astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations. Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being [...] "...empty boxes that have nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars." [...] Sole use of the tropical zodiac is inconsistent with references made, by the same astrologers, to the Age of Aquarius, which depends on when the vernal point enters the constellation of Aquarius.|$|E

2500|$|According to William Gazecki {{and other}} critics, the prosecutor's office was spurred {{to lay the}} {{heaviest}} possible charges by the victim's father, an LAPD police officer; and says that if the victim {{had not been a}} police officer's son the felony murder rule would never have been applied. [...] In a CBS 60 Minutes II segment, a spokesman for the defendants' families charges that the boys were punished not for what they did, but for who was killed. [...] The spokesman says, [...] "It's about a police officer's son who died. [...] And the only way they could convict all these kids was use the felony murder rule."

2500|$|Ever {{since his}} days in the Louisiana State Legislature, Vitter has been a {{longtime}} opponent of gambling. Beginning in 2002, Vitter opposed the bid by the Jena Band of Choctaw Indians to build a casino in Louisiana, arguing that the build site was not historically part of their tribal lands. He lobbied the Interior Department and included language in an appropriations bill to stop the casino. Although the Interior Department gave its approval, the casino {{has not yet been}} approved by the state. The Jena chief accused Vitter of ties with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who simultaneously lobbied against the casino. The chairman of the Senate committee investigating the lobbyist said, [...] "The committee has seen absolutely no evidence whatsoever that Senator Vitter's opposition to (the proposed casino) had to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> other than his long-standing opposition to gambling." [...] In 2007 and 2008, Vitter introduced a bill to prohibit Indian casinos such as Jena's. Neither bill became law.|$|E
2500|$|Bishop did not {{see herself}} as a [...] "lesbian poet" [...] or as a [...] "female poet". Because she refused to have her work {{published}} in all-female poetry anthologies, other female poets involved with the women's movement thought she was hostile towards the movement. For instance, a student at Harvard who was close to Bishop in the 60s, Kathleen Spivack, wrote in her memoir, [...] "I think Bishop internalized the misogyny of the time. How could she not? ... Bishop had a very ambivalent relation to being a woman plus poet—plus lesbian—in the Boston/Cambridge/Harvard nexus ... Extremely vulnerable, sensitive, she hid much of her private life. She wanted nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> that seemed to involve the women's movement. She internalized many of the male attitudes of the day toward women, {{who were supposed to}} be attractive, appealing to men, and not ask for equal pay or a job with benefits." [...] However, this was not how Bishop necessarily viewed herself. In an interview with The Paris Review from 1978, she said that, despite her insistence on being excluded from female poetry anthologies, she still considered herself to be [...] "a strong feminist" [...] but that she only wanted to be judged based on the quality of her writing and not on her gender or sexual orientation.|$|E

Dr. Dolliver complied submissively, and the Colonel, with dull, unkindly eyes, looked at him sternly, and {{with a kind of}} intelligence amid the aged stolidity of his aspect, that somewhat puzzled the Doctor. In this way he surveyed him all over, like a judge, when he means to hang a man, and for some reason or none, the apothecary felt his nerves shake, beneath this steadfast look.|$|R

Well, Elsie learned some of our ways, but she couldn't stand the business, and she had a bit of honest money of her own, so she gave us all the slip and got away to London.
