5|$|Nevertheless, Matsui's {{instructions}} {{said nothing}} about treatment of Chinese POWs. Matsui inadvertently contributed to the atrocity {{in a major way}} when he demanded on December 14 that his triumphal <b>entrance</b> <b>into</b> Nanking be scheduled for the early date of December 17. At the time his subordinates in Nanking objected because they were {{still in the process of}} scrambling to apprehend all the former Chinese soldiers hiding in the city and had no facilities in which to hold them. Regardless, Matsui held firm, and in many cases his men responded to the conundrum by ordering that all their prisoners be executed immediately after capture. Most of the large-scale massacres that took place within Nanking occurred in the days immediately prior to Matsui's <b>entrance</b> <b>into</b> the city.|$|E
