5|$|The architects {{sought to}} create an approachable {{building}} that reflected {{the role of the}} PUB as a public supplier of gas and electricity, and this led them to choose strong horizontal elements for the design. In the building's façade, this is achieved with distinctive rows of vertical fins, staggered so as to emphasise horizontal movement; these fins also provide shade. A secondary horizontal pattern results from grouping two or more rows of these fins <b>in</b> <b>blocks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Auschwitz II Birkenau was liberated by the Red Army {{at around}} 3:30 p.m. on 27 January 1945, {{and the main}} camp (Auschwitz I) two hours later. Military trucks loaded with bread arrived the next day. Volunteers began to offer first aid and improvised {{assistance}} the following week. In early February, the Polish Red Cross hospital opened <b>in</b> <b>blocks</b> 14, 21, and 22 at Auschwitz I, headed by Dr. Józef Bellert and staffed by 30 volunteer doctors and nurses from Kraków, along with around 90 former inmates. The critically injured patients – estimated at several thousands – were relocated from Birkenau and Monowitz to the main camp. Some orphaned children were immediately adopted by Oświęcim residents, while others were transferred to Kraków, where {{a number of them}} were adopted by Polish families. Others were placed in an orphanage at Harbutowice.|$|E

40|$|More than 300 {{residents}} of a private high-rise housing estate were infected with {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} within a short period during the 2003 epidemic in Hong Kong. The outbreak occurred after the identified index patient visited a flat on a middle floor <b>in</b> <b>Block</b> E of the Amoy Gardens estate on two nights. Approximately 45 % of the subsequently infected people resided <b>in</b> <b>Block</b> E, while the other 55 % of infected cases mainly resided <b>in</b> six other <b>blocks</b> close to Block E. The distribution of the infected flats <b>in</b> <b>Block</b> E conformed to a non-uniform spatial pattern. Probable environmental causes for airborne transmission associated with the air movements between flats <b>in</b> <b>Block</b> E are identified. The well-established multi-zone airflow modeling method was used to analyze the virus-laden bio-aerosol dispersion between flats through door and window leakage areas <b>in</b> <b>Block</b> E under six different scenarios. The distribution of infection risk <b>in</b> <b>Block</b> E matched with the virus concentrations in flats predicted with the use of multi-zone modeling.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{concern about the}} predicted negative effects of the future doubling of carbon dioxide on the earth. This concern has evoked interest in the potential for urban greenspace to help reduce the levels of atmospheric carbon. This study quanti®es greenspace-related carbon storage and annual carbon ¯uxes for urban residential landscapes. For detailed quanti®cation, the scale {{of this study was}} limited to two residential <b>blocks</b> <b>in</b> northwest Chicago which had a signi®cant difference in vegetation cover. Differences between the two <b>blocks</b> <b>in</b> the size of greenspace area and vegetation cover resulted in considerable differences in total carbon storage and annual carbon uptake. Total carbon storage in greenspace was about 26 ´ 15 kg/m 2 of greenspace <b>in</b> study <b>block</b> 1, and 23 ´ 20 kg/m 2 of greenspace <b>in</b> <b>block</b> 2. Of the total, soil carbon accounted for approximately 78 ´ 7 % <b>in</b> <b>block</b> 1 and 88 ´ 7 % <b>in</b> <b>block</b> 2. Trees and shrubs <b>in</b> <b>block</b> 1 and block 2 accounted for 20 ´ 8 % and 10 ´ 6 %, respectively. The carbon storage in grass and other herbaceous plants was approximately 0 ´ 5 ± 0 ´ 7 % <b>in</b> both <b>blocks.</b> Total net annual carbon input to the study blocks by all the greenspace components was in the region of 0 ´ 49 kg/m 2 of greenspace <b>in</b> <b>block</b> 1 and 0 ´ 32 kg/m 2 of greenspace <b>in</b> <b>block</b> 2. The principal net carbon release from greenspaces of the two residential landscapes was from grass maintenance. Greenspace planning and management strategies were explored to minimize carbon release and maximize carbon uptake. 1995 Academic Press Limite...|$|R
