40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{investigation}} of the reliability of turbulence measurements by radars when the spectral-width method is used. This method employs the <b>spectral</b> <b>widths</b> observed by radar (experimental <b>spectral</b> <b>width)</b> to determine turbulence. However, the experimental width can be affected by non-turbulent effects, including radar geometry. Therefore, the <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> due to non-turbulent effects (theoretical <b>spectral</b> <b>width)</b> must be removed from the experimental width. This can occasionally lead to negative values of turbulence. It is our aim (1) to study the effects of both experimental and theoretical <b>spectral</b> <b>widths</b> on the accuracy of turbulence measurements, (2) to study the validity of “negative” values of turbulence, and (3) to compare radar-estimated values of turbulence with in-situ measurements. This is performed by studying the factors that can contribute to errors in estimation of <b>spectral</b> <b>widths,</b> including mean wind speed, wind shear, anisotropy and length of data. In addition to that, radar-estimated turbulence is compared to turbulence measured by high-resolution research and commercial aircraft. Significant findings include: 1. The statistical fluctuations of mean wind speed and its impact on estimation of the theoretical <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> is {{the most important factor in}} producing errors in turbulence measurements. 2. The choice of spectrum fitting algorithm and length of data is very important in producing experimental <b>spectral</b> <b>widths.</b> 3. In order to estimate theoretical widths more accurately, a formula is developed by comparing models that calculate the theoretical <b>spectral</b> <b>width.</b> 4. It is found that both negative and positive values of turbulence need to be included in turbulence analysis. However, if the percentage of negatives exceeds 35 %, the measurements are not reliable. 5. Turbulence data measured by radar agrees well with high-resolution aircraft data for weak turbulence. However, in-situ aircraft measurements show a higher probability of strong turbulence than hourly radar data. 6. The theoretical <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> is small compared to the experimental one for strong turbulence. By discarding the theoretical <b>spectral</b> <b>widths</b> in turbulence calculations, we can measure near-instantaneous values of turbulence rather than hourly averages. Therefore, we can improve the agreement between the aircraft-estimated and radar-estimated turbulence for strong values of turbulence...|$|R
40|$|SuperDARN radars are {{sensitive}} to the collective Doppler characteristics of decametre-scale irregularities in the high latitude ionosphere.

Because of its equatorward location, the TIGER Tasmanian radar is very sensitive to the detection of the <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> boundary (SWB) in the nightside auroral ionosphere. An analysis of the line-of-sight velocities and 2 -D beam-swinging vectors suggests the meso-scale (~ 100 km) convection is more erratic in the high <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> region, but slower and more homogeneous in the low <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> region. The radar autocorrelation functions are better modelled using Lorentzian Doppler spectra in the high <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> region, and Gaussian Doppler spectra in the low <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> region. However, paradoxically, Gaussian Doppler spectra are associated with the largest <b>spectral</b> <b>widths.</b> Application of the Burg maximum entropy method suggests the occurrence of double-peaked Doppler spectra is greater in the high <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> region, implying the small-scale (~ 10 km) velocity fluctuations are more intense above the SWB. These observations combined with collective wave scattering theory imply there is a transition from a fast flowing, turbulent plasma with a correlation length of velocity fluctuations less than the scattering wavelength, to a slower moving plasma with a correlation length greater than the scattering wavelength. Peak scaling and structure function analysis of fluctuations in the SWB itself reveals approximately scale-free behaviour across temporal scales of ~ 10 s to ~ 34 min. Preliminary scaling exponents for these fluctuations, &alpha;GSF= 0. 18 &plusmn; 0. 02 and &alpha;GSF= 0. 09 &plusmn; 0. 01, are even smaller than that expected for MHD turbulence...|$|R

A well defined gradient in the <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> parameter was present, with mainly low (200 ms - 1) <b>spectral</b> <b>widths</b> in the higher latitude part. The relationship between the <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> and the red line (630. 0 nm) emission measured by the meridian scanning photometer is considered. The poleward border of the red line emission, which has, in the past, been proposed as being representative of the polar cap boundary, was co-located to within 1 ° of magnetic latitude with the gradient in <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> for part of the interval. Statistically, large <b>spectral</b> <b>widths</b> occurred poleward of the red line emission, while small <b>spectral</b> <b>widths</b> occurred within or equatorward of the red line emission. Near simultaneous DMSP particle observations in the 20 eV to 20 keV range indicate that the poleward border of the red line emission and the gradient in <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> occurred at the same latitude as the transition from auroral oval to polar rain particle energies. We conclude that the large <b>spectral</b> <b>widths</b> were not caused by particle precipitation associated with the auroral oval. There were two periods of special interest when the relationship between the red line and the <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> broke down. The first of these happened during enhanced red line and green line (557. 7 nm) emission, with a drop out of the radar scatter and an enhanced, narrow westward electrojet. We conclude that this event was a magnetospheric substorm occurring at much higher than usual latitudes. The second period of special interest happened when equatorward moving bands of large <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> occurred within the region of scatter. Up to 4 of these bands were present during an interval of 100 minutes. Associated with these narrow bands of large <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> were narrow channels of enhanced westward ion velocities. We conclude that these equatorward moving bands of large <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> may be related to reconnection processes in the tail. The observations demonstrate that the tail continues to be active even under low solar wind energy input conditions. Furthermore, we conclude that the gradient in the <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> may be used as a proxy for the polar cap boundary, but only with extreme caution...|$|R

40|$|The Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars {{are proving}} to be a very {{powerful}} experimental tool for exploring solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions. They measure the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the signal backscattered from ionospheric irregularities, and they derive parameters such as the Doppler velocity and the <b>spectral</b> <b>width.</b> The associated spectra have a specific behavior inside the cusp, a strong temporal and spatial evolution of the velocity and <b>spectral</b> <b>width,</b> and a high value of the <b>spectral</b> <b>width.</b> Until now, no studies have explained these characteristics, but they are routinely used to detect the cusp in the radar data, for example, to estimate the location of the open/closed field line boundary. Both satellite and ground-based magnetometer data from the cusp region show broadband wave activity in the Pc 1 and Pc 2 frequency band. In this study we evaluate how such wave activity modifies the radar's ACF, and we conclude that it explains the spectra seen in the cusp. More specifically, we find that (1) even a monochromatic electric field variation can cause apparently turbulent behavior, including wide <b>spectral</b> <b>widths</b> and apparent multiple components, (2) even low-amplitude waves are capable of causing large <b>spectral</b> <b>widths,</b> if the frequency is sufficiently high, (3) for a fixed low-amplitude electric field variation the measured <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> increases with wave frequency, displaying a sharp transition from low to high <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> above an onset frequency, and (4) the determination of the background velocity field is not strongly affected by such conditions.

40|$|The HF radars of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) provide {{measurements}} of the E × B drift of ionospheric plasma over extended regions of the high-latitude ionosphere. We have conducted a statistical study of the associated Doppler <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> of ionospheric F-region echoes. The study has been conducted with all available radars from the Northern Hemisphere for 2 specific periods of time. Period 1 corresponds to the winter months of 1994, while period 2 covers October 1996 to March 1997. The distributions of data points and average <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> are presented {{as a function of}} Magnetic Latitude and Magnetic Local Time. The databases are very consistent and exhibit the same features. The most stringent features are: a region of very high <b>spectral</b> <b>width,</b> collocated with the ionospheric LLBL/cusp/mantle region; an oval shaped region of high <b>spectral</b> <b>width,</b> whose equator-ward boundary matches the poleward limit of the Holzworth and Meng auroral oval.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is aimed to improving {{our understanding of the}} HF Doppler <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> parameter and how {{it can be used to}} identify ionospheric and magnetospheric boundaries, specifically the use of the frequently observed gradient between high (> 200 m s- 1) and low (< 200 m s- 1) <b>spectral</b> <b>width.</b> Locating the boundaries between regions is important to the study of how the magnetosphere responds to the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field conditions. Three case studies and a statistical investigation are presented herein which investigate the nature of these regions. Data from the Co-operative U. K. Twin Located Auroral Sounding System (CUTLASS) HF radars and the European Incoherent SCATter (EISCAT) radars from the primary observations. The cases presented show that high <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> can be observed both on open and closed magnetic field lines, and that there is a relationship between elevated electron temperature and high <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> (although the reverse is not true) which appears to be restricted to the post 0300 MLT nightside region. The data also show that high <b>spectral</b> <b>widths</b> can be associated with both single- and multiple-peak HF spectra. The statistical study compares three years of data from the CUTLASS radars and the Syowa East radar (part of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network, SuperDARN), magnetically conjugate to Iceland East. It is found that the mean <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> is dependent on latitude, magnetic local time (MLT) and season. The data from the two hemispheres show similar dependence on these factors, although the Syowa East <b>spectral</b> <b>widths</b> are larger in general (instrumental variations are discounted).

30|$|The flows {{that show}} no {{correlation}} between SYM-H and MLAT {{are considered to be}} mid-latitude F-region echoes (Fukao et al. 1988). In order to be sure that these echoes are the mid-latitude F-region echoes, it is necessary to confirm that they have similar characteristics. Fukao et al. (1988) revealed that mid-latitude F-region echoes have <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> of 20 – 30  Hz using the MU VHF radar observation. Since the <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> is considered to correspond to the decorrelation time of echoes, we need to confirm that our echoes with no SYM-H-latitude relationship have similar parameters. Thus, we checked the <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> of these echoes converted into the values in the unit of Hertz instead of meters per second. We found {{that the majority of the}} echoes have <b>spectral</b> <b>widths</b> less than 40  Hz, which is comparable to the mid-latitude F-region echoes. On the contrary, most of the echoes identified as SAPS (with close SYM-H-latitude relationships) have <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> wider than 40  Hz, indicating that their characteristics are different from mid-latitude F-region echoes.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAccurately {{measuring}} {{the location and}} motion of the polar cap boundary (PCB) in the high-latitude ionosphere can be crucial for studies concerned with {{the dynamics of the}} polar cap, e. g. the measurement of reconnection rates. The Doppler <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> characteristics of backscatter received by the SuperDARN HF radars have been previously used for locating and tracking the PCB in the cusp region. The boundary is generally observed in meridional beams of the SuperDARN radars and appears as a distinct change between low <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> values observed equatorward of the cusp region, and high, but variable <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> values observed within the cusp region. To identify the <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> boundary (SWB) between these two regions, a simple algorithm employing a <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> threshold has often been applied to the data. However, there is not, as yet, a standard algorithm, or <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> threshold, which is universally applied. Nor has there been any rigorous assessment of the accuracy of this method of boundary determination. This study applies a series of threshold algorithms to a simulated cusp-region <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> data set, to assess the accuracy of different algorithms. This shows that simple threshold algorithms correctly identify the boundary location in, at the most, 50 % of the cases and that the average boundary error is at least ~ 1 ? 2 range gates (~ 1 ° latitude). It transpires that spatial and temporal smoothing of the <b>spectral</b> <b>width</b> data (e. g. by median filtering), before application of a threshold algorithm can increase the boundary determination accuracy to over 95 % and the average boundary error to much less than a range gate.

This analysis highlights the increased accuracy of the enhanced boundary determination algorithm in the cusp region.
