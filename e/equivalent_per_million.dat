40|$|OBJECTIVES. We {{compared}} US and Canadian {{health administration}} costs using national medical care employment data for both countries. METHODS. Data from census surveys on hospital, nursing home, and outpatient {{employment in the}} United States (1968 to 1993) and Canada (1971 and 1986) were analyzed. RESULTS. Between 1968 and 1993, US medical care employment grew from 3. 976 to 10. 308 million full-time equivalents. Administration grew from 0. 719 to 2. 792 million full-time equivalents, or from 18. 1 % to 27. 1 % of the total employment. In 1986, the United States deployed 33, 666 health care full-time <b>equivalent</b> personnel <b>per</b> <b>million</b> population, and Canada deployed 31, 529. The US excess was all administrative; Canada employed more clinical personnel, especially registered nurses. Between 1971 and 1986, hospital employment per capita grew 29 % in the United States (mostly because of administrative growth) and fell 14 % in Canada. In 1986, Canadian hospitals still employed more clinical staff <b>per</b> <b>million.</b> Outpatient employment was larger and grew faster in the United States. Per capita nursing home employment was substantially higher in Canada. CONCLUSIONS. If US hospitals and outpatient facilities adopted Canada's staffing patterns, 1, 407, 000 fewer managers and clerks would be necessary.

40|$|Patients with end stage renal {{diseases}} (ESRD) are generally tested for donor chimerism after kidney transplantation for tolerance mechanism purposes. But, to our knowledge, no {{data are available}} on natural and/or iatrogenic microchimerism (Mc), deriving from pregnancy and/or blood transfusion, acquired prior to transplantation. In this context, we tested the prevalence of male Mc using a real time PCR assay for DYS 14, a Y-chromosome specific sequence, in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) from 55 women with ESRD, prior to their first kidney transplantation, and compared them with results from 82 healthy women. Male Mc was also quantified in 5 native kidney biopsies obtained two to four years prior to blood testing and in PBMC from 8 women collected after female kidney transplantation, several years after the initial blood testing. Women with ESRD showed statistically higher frequencies (62 %) and quantities (98 genome <b>equivalent</b> cells <b>per</b> <b>million</b> of host cells, gEq/M) of male Mc in their PBMC than healthy women (16 % and 0. 3 gEq/M, p, 0. 00001 and p = 0. 0005 respectively). Male Mc was increased in women with ESRD whether they had or not a history of male pregnancy and/or of blood transfusion. Three out of five renal biopsies obtained a few years prior to the blood test also contained Mc, but no correlation could be established between earlier Mc in a kidney and later presence in PBMC. Finally, several years after female kidney transplantation, male Mc was totally cleared from PBMC in all women tested but one.

To determine the true impact of SCI, this systematic review aims to summarize literature reporting on either the incidence or prevalence of SCI. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Trial Register, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to identify relevant literature published through June 2013. We sought studies that provided regional, provincial/state, or national data on the incidence of SCI or reported estimates of disease prevalence. The level of evidence of each study was rated using a scale that evaluated study design, methodology, sampling bias, and precision of estimates. Results: The initial search yielded 5, 874 articles, 48 of which met the inclusion criteria. Forty-four studies estimated the incidence of SCI and nine reported the prevalence, with five discussing both. Of the incidence studies, 14 provided figures at a regional, ten at a state or provincial level and 21 at a national level. The prevalence of SCI was highest in the United States of America (906 <b>per</b> <b>million)</b> and lowest in the Rhone-Alpes region, France (250 <b>per</b> <b>million)</b> and Helsinki, Finland (280 <b>per</b> <b>million).</b> With respect to states and provinces in North America, the crude annual incidence of SCI was highest in Alaska (83 <b>per</b> <b>million)</b> and Mississippi (77 <b>per</b> <b>million)</b> and lowest in Alabama (29. 4 <b>per</b> <b>million),</b> despite {{a large percentage of}} violence injuries (21. 2 %). Annual incidences were above 50 <b>per</b> <b>million</b> in the Hualien County in Taiwan (56. 1 <b>per</b> <b>million),</b> the central Portugal region (58 <b>per</b> <b>million),</b> and Olmsted County in Minnesota (54. 8 <b>per</b> <b>million)</b> and were lower than 20 <b>per</b> <b>million</b> in Taipei, Taiwan (14. 6 <b>per</b> <b>million),</b> the Rhone-Alpes region in France (12. 7 <b>per</b> <b>million),</b> Aragon, Spain (12. 1 <b>per</b> <b>million),</b> Southeast Turkey (16. 9 <b>per</b> <b>million),</b> and Stockholm, Sweden (19. 5 <b>per</b> <b>million).</b> The highest national incidence was 49. 1 <b>per</b> <b>million</b> in New Zealand, and the lowest incidences were in Fiji (10. 0 <b>per</b> <b>million)</b> and Spain (8. 0 <b>per</b> <b>million).</b> The majority of studies showed a high male-to-female ratio and an age of peak incidence of younger than 30 years old. Traffic accidents were typically {{the most common cause of}} SCI, followed by falls in the elderly population. Conclusion: This review demonstrates that the incidence, prevalence, and causation of SCI differs between developing and developed countries and suggests that management and preventative strategies need to be tailored to regional trends. The rising aging population in westernized countries also indicates that traumatic SCI secondary to falls may become an increasing public health challenge and that incidence among the elderly may rise with increasing life expectancy.
