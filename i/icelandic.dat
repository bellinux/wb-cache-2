5|$|Almost {{half of all}} {{the loans}} made by <b>Icelandic</b> banks were to {{holdings}} companies, many of which are connected to those same <b>Icelandic</b> banks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{preceding}} the crisis, three <b>Icelandic</b> banks, Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir, multiplied in size. This expansion {{was driven by}} ready access to credit in international financial markets, in particular short-term financing. As the international financial crisis unfolded in 2007–2008, investors perceived the <b>Icelandic</b> banks to be increasingly risky. Trust in the banks gradually faded, leading to a sharp depreciation of the <b>Icelandic</b> króna in 2008 and increased difficulties for the banks in rolling over their short-term debt. At {{the end of the}} second quarter of 2008, Iceland's external debt was 9.553 trillion <b>Icelandic</b> krónur (€50 billion), more than 7 times the GDP of Iceland in 2007. The assets of the three banks totaled 14.437 trillion krónur at {{the end of the second}} quarter 2008, equal to more than 11 times the national GDP. Due to the huge size of the <b>Icelandic</b> financial system in comparison with the <b>Icelandic</b> economy, the Central Bank of Iceland found itself unable to act as a lender of last resort during the crisis, further aggravating the mistrust in the banking system.|$|E
5|$|On 6 October, {{a number}} of private interbank credit {{facilities}} to <b>Icelandic</b> banks were shut down. Prime Minister Geir Haarde addressed the nation in a speech that became infamous for its portentous closing words: 'God bless Iceland'. He announced a package of new regulatory measures which were {{to be put to}} the Althing, Iceland's parliament, immediately, with the cooperation of the opposition parties. These included the power of the FME to take over the running of <b>Icelandic</b> banks without nationalising them, and preferential treatment for depositors in the event that a bank had to be liquidated. In a separate measure, retail deposits in <b>Icelandic</b> branches of <b>Icelandic</b> banks were guaranteed in full. The emergency measures had been deemed unnecessary by the <b>Icelandic</b> government less than 24 hours earlier.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Icelandic</b> Music Awards (Icelandic: Íslensku tónlistarverðlaunin) were {{established}} in 1993 to encourage and reward <b>Icelandic</b> musicians and to further the local and international reputation of <b>Icelandic</b> music. Björk so far has received twenty-five awards from fifty-one nominations.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Icelandic</b> {{horse is}} a breed of horse {{developed}} in Iceland. Although the horses are small, at times pony-sized, most registries for the <b>Icelandic</b> {{refer to it}} as a horse. <b>Icelandic</b> horses are long-lived and hardy. In their native country they have few diseases; <b>Icelandic</b> law prevents horses from being imported into the country and exported animals are not allowed to return. The <b>Icelandic</b> displays two gaits in addition to the typical walk, trot, and canter/gallop commonly displayed by other breeds. The only breed of horse in Iceland, they are also popular internationally, and sizable populations exist in Europe and North America. The breed is still used for traditional sheepherding work in its native country, as well as for leisure, showing, and racing.|$|E
5|$|About 900years ago, {{attempts}} were made to introduce eastern blood into the <b>Icelandic,</b> resulting in a degeneration of the stock. In 982AD the <b>Icelandic</b> Althing (parliament) passed laws prohibiting the importation of horses into Iceland, thus ending crossbreeding. The breed has now been bred pure in Iceland for more than 1,000years.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics differ {{between various}} groups of <b>Icelandic</b> horses, {{depending}} on the focus of individual breeders. Some focus on animals for pack and draft work, which are conformationally distinct from those bred for work under saddle, which are carefully selected {{for their ability to}} perform the traditional <b>Icelandic</b> gaits. Others are bred solely for horsemeat. Some breeders focus on favored coat colors.|$|E
5|$|Developed from ponies {{taken to}} Iceland by Norse {{settlers}} in the 9th and 10th centuries, the breed is mentioned in literature and historical records throughout <b>Icelandic</b> history; the first reference to a named horse appears in the 12th century. Horses were venerated in Norse mythology, a custom brought to Iceland by the country's earliest settlers. Selective breeding over the centuries has developed the breed into its current form. Natural selection has also played a role, as the harsh <b>Icelandic</b> climate eliminated many horses through cold and starvation. In the 1780s, much of the breed was wiped out {{in the aftermath of}} a volcanic eruption at Laki. The first breed society for the <b>Icelandic</b> horse was created in Iceland in 1904, and today the breed is represented by organizations in 19different nations, organized under a parent association, the International Federation of <b>Icelandic</b> Horse Associations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Icelandic</b> horses {{still play}} {{a large part}} in <b>Icelandic</b> life, despite {{increasing}} mechanization and road improvements that diminish the necessity for the breed's use. The first official <b>Icelandic</b> horse race was held at Akureyri in 1874, and many races are still held throughout the country from April through June. Both gallop and pace races are held, as well as performance classes showcasing the breed's unique gaits. Winter events are often held, including races on frozen bodies of water. In 2009 such an event resulted in both horses and riders falling {{into the water and}} needing to be rescued. The first shows, focused on the quality of animals as breeding stock, were held in 1906. The Agricultural Society of Iceland, along with the National Association of Riding Clubs, now organizes regular shows {{with a wide variety of}} classes. Some horses are still bred for slaughter, and much of the meat is exported to Japan. Farmers still use the breed to round up sheep in the <b>Icelandic</b> highlands, but most horses are used for competition and leisure riding.|$|E
5|$|Icelandics were {{exported}} to Great Britain before the 20th century {{to work as}} pit ponies in the coal mines, because of their strength and small size. However, those horses were never registered and little evidence of their existence remains. The first formal exports of <b>Icelandic</b> horses were to Germany in the 1940s. Great Britain's first official imports were in 1956, when a Scottish farmer, Stuart McKintosh, began a breeding program. Other breeders in Great Britain followed McKintosh's lead, and the <b>Icelandic</b> Horse Society of Great Britain was formed in 1986. The number of <b>Icelandic</b> horses {{exported to}} other nations has steadily increased since the first exports of the mid-19th century. Since 1969, multiple societies have worked together to preserve, improve and market these horses {{under the auspices of}} the International Federation of <b>Icelandic</b> Horse Associations. Today, the <b>Icelandic</b> remains a breed known for its purity of bloodline, and is the only horse breed present in Iceland.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{stabilize}} the situation, the <b>Icelandic</b> government stated that all domestic deposits in <b>Icelandic</b> banks would be guaranteed, imposed strict capital controls to stabilize {{the value of the}} <b>Icelandic</b> króna, and secured a US$5.1bn sovereign debt package from the IMF and the Nordic countries in order to finance a budget deficit and the restoration of the banking system. The international bailout support programme led by IMF officially ended on 31 August 2011, while the capital controls which were imposed in November 2008 were lifted on 14 March 2017.|$|E
5|$|Integrating elves into Christian {{cosmology}} without identifying them as demons. The {{most striking}} examples are serious theological treatises: the <b>Icelandic</b> Tíðfordrif (1644) by Jón Guðmundsson lærði or, in Scotland, Robert Kirk's Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns and Fairies (1691). This approach also {{appears in the}} Old English poem Beowulf, which lists elves among the races springing from Cain's murder of Abel. The late thirteenth-century South English Legendary and some <b>Icelandic</b> folktales explain elves as angels that sided neither with Lucifer nor with God, and were banished by God to earth rather than hell. One famous <b>Icelandic</b> folktale explains elves as the lost children of Eve.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Wednesday, 8 October 2008, the Central Bank of Iceland {{abandoned}} its attempt to peg the <b>Icelandic</b> króna at 131 krónur to the euro after trying to set this peg on 6 October. By 9 October, the <b>Icelandic</b> króna was trading at 340 to the euro when trading in the currency collapsed due to the FME's takeover of the last major <b>Icelandic</b> bank, and thus the loss of all króna trade 'clearing houses'. The next day, the central bank introduced restrictions on the purchase of foreign currency within Iceland. From 9 October to 5 November, the European Central Bank quoted a reference rate of 305 krónur to the euro.|$|E
5|$|Swedish is an Indo-European {{language}} {{belonging to}} the North Germanic branch of the Germanic languages. In the established classification, {{it belongs to the}} East Scandinavian languages together with Danish, separating it from the West Scandinavian languages, consisting of Faroese, <b>Icelandic</b> and Norwegian. However, more recent analyses divide the North Germanic languages into two groups: Insular Scandinavian (Faroese and <b>Icelandic),</b> and Continental Scandinavian (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), based on mutual intelligibility due to heavy influence of East Scandinavian (particularly Danish) on Norwegian during the last millennium and divergence from both Faroese and <b>Icelandic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>Icelandic</b> {{education}} system comprises four levels: playschool, compulsory, upper secondary and higher.|$|E
5|$|The foreign {{exchange}} rules also oblige <b>Icelandic</b> residents to deposit any new foreign currency they receive with an <b>Icelandic</b> bank. There is anecdotal evidence that some <b>Icelandic</b> exporters had been operating an informal offshore {{foreign exchange}} market, trading pounds and euros for krónur outside {{the control of}} any regulator and starving the onshore market of foreign currency. Hence the Central Bank had to sell €124 million of currency reserves in November 2008 {{to make up the}} difference, compared with an estimated trade surplus of €13.9 million.|$|E

5|$|Around 1990, empty {{bindings}} {{stripped of}} their pages {{began to appear in}} the Widener stacks. Eventually some 600 mutilated books were discovered, the vandal preferring works on early Christianity in Greek, Latin, or unusual languages such as <b>Icelandic.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the <b>Icelandic</b> banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the <b>Icelandic</b> government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the <b>Icelandic</b> banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E

5|$|Gerðr has {{inspired}} {{works of art}} and literature. The Danish poet Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger wrote a series of poems referencing Gerðr as collected in (1819) Nordens Guder. Esaias Tegnér's (1782–1846) unfinished epic poem Gerda also references the goddess. K. Ehrenberg depicted the goddess in his illustration (1883) Freyr und Gerda, Skade und Niurd. Her story was retold in free verse by the <b>Icelandic</b> poet Gerður Kristný in her Blóðhófnir, which won the 2010 <b>Icelandic</b> Literature Award.|$|E
5|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes {{that the}} events in Völuspá {{occurring}} {{after the death of}} the gods (the sun turning black, steam rising, flames touching the heavens, etc.) may be inspired by the volcanic eruptions on Iceland. Records of eruptions on Iceland bear strong similarities to the sequence of events described in Völuspá, especially the eruption at Laki that occurred in 1783. Bertha Phillpotts theorizes that the figure of Surtr was inspired by <b>Icelandic</b> eruptions, and that he was a volcano demon. Surtr's name occurs in some <b>Icelandic</b> place names, among them the lava tube caves Surtshellir, a number of dark caverns in the volcanic central region of Iceland.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, Ólafur Hauksson (b. Reykjavík 1964) was appointed; {{it was the}} <b>Icelandic</b> government's second {{attempt to}} appoint to the role, and Ólafur {{was one of only}} two applicants. He had {{previously}} been the police chief in Akranes. At the time the unit had four staff members; by September 2013 it had 109, with 140 cases under investigation. By that time, the top managers of all three <b>Icelandic</b> banks which collapsed during the financial crisis had been charged, though the cases progressed slowly.|$|E
5|$|In June 2002, when Jiang Zemin visited Iceland, <b>Icelandic</b> {{authorities}} {{complied with}} requests from the Chinese government to deny entry to Falun Gong practitioners {{who sought to}} enter the country to protest. Using a blacklist provided by China, hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners were turned away by the national airline or detained if they managed {{to make it to}} the country. The blacklisting ignited protests by <b>Icelandic</b> citizens and members of parliament. In 2011, Iceland's foreign minister Össur Skarphéðinsson issued an apology for violating Falun Gong practitioners' freedom of expression and movement.|$|E
5|$|In Norway {{the three}} {{synoptic}} histories, Historia de Antiquitate Regum Norwagiensium, Historia Norwegie and Ágrip af Nóregskonungasögum (ca. 1190), all give a short {{account of the}} battle. The <b>Icelandic</b> kings' sagas offer a much more extensive treatment, starting with Oddr Snorrason's Saga of Olaf Tryggvason (ca. 1190). Working from skaldic poetry, oral history, learned European examples and an uninhibited imagination, Oddr constructed an elaborate account of the battle. This was {{taken up by the}} later <b>Icelandic</b> sagas, Fagrskinna and Heimskringla (ca. 1220), both of which add quotations of skaldic verse. Three <b>Icelandic</b> poems from around 1200 also have some historical interest: Nóregs konungatal, Rekstefja and Óláfs drápa Tryggvasonar. The immense Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta (ca. 1300) combines several of the above sources to form the last, longest and least reliable saga account.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1950s, {{fishermen}} in Iceland requested {{assistance from the}} government to remove Killer Whales from <b>Icelandic</b> waters as they damaged fishing equipment. With fisheries accounting for 20% of Iceland's employment at the time, the perceived economic impact was significant. The <b>Icelandic</b> government asked the United States for assistance. As a NATO ally with an air base in Iceland, the US Navy deployed Patrol Squadrons VP-18 and VP-7 to achieve this task. According to the US Navy, hundreds of animals were killed with machineguns, rockets and depth charges.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the rise in prices – 14% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with a target of 2.5% – the Central Bank of Iceland held interest rates high (15.5%). Such high interest rates, compared with 5.5% in the United Kingdom or 4% in the eurozone for example, encouraged overseas investors to hold deposits in <b>Icelandic</b> krónur, leading to monetary inflation: the <b>Icelandic</b> money supply (M3) grew 56.5% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with 5.0% GDP growth. The situation was effectively an economic bubble, with investors overestimating the true value of the króna.|$|E
5|$|In state-run institutions, {{students}} {{only need}} pay registration fees; {{there are no}} tuition fees. Private institutions, however, charge fees. All students are eligible to some financial support from the <b>Icelandic</b> Student Loan Fund; the exact amount depends on their financial and personal situation. The student must begin to repay this money two years after completing their study programme. In addition to <b>Icelandic</b> students, students from the European Union or EEA-EFTA member states are also eligible to apply for loans, {{if they have been}} working in their trade in the country for at least one year.|$|E
5|$|Most of the <b>Icelandic</b> glaciers retreated rapidly {{during the}} warm decades from 1930 to 1960, slowing {{down as the}} climate cooled during the {{following}} decade, and started to advance after 1970. The rate of advance peaked in the 1980s, after which it slowed down until about 1990. As a consequence of rapid warming of the climate {{that has taken place}} since the mid-1980s, most glaciers in Iceland began to retreat after 1990, and by 2000 all monitored non-surge type glaciers in Iceland were retreating. An average of 45 non-surging termini were monitored each year by the <b>Icelandic</b> Glaciological Society from 2000–2005.|$|E
5|$|Parts of the <b>Icelandic</b> public have {{arranged}} {{protests against the}} Central Bank, the Parliament and the government's alleged lack of responsibility {{before and after the}} crisis, attracting between 3000 and 6000 people (1–2% of Iceland's population) on Saturdays.|$|E
5|$|String {{arrangements}} were added {{late in the}} recording process.
