40|$|The {{increase}} in health expenditures has raised important {{questions about the}} appropriate height of health care spending {{as well as the}} <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> these <b>expenditures.</b> One tool in the search of ensuring the optimal allocation of scarce societal and health care resources is economic evaluation of health care interventions, such as new pharmaceuticals, diagnostics or preventive measures. In economic evaluations, the costs of an intervention are compared to its benefits, expressed in some meaningful manner. Consistently applying these evaluations, in theory, would ensure an optimal level of spending in the health care sector (that is, the size of the budget, or how much to spend on health) as well as an optimal use of the available resources within the budget (that is, on what the budget is spent). This optimal spending can be defined in light of the twin goals of health care policy; efficiency and equity. As such, economic evaluations can be seen as applied welfare economics, aimed at informing social choices to come to a maximization of broadly defined welfare...|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since the}} Earth Summit was {{launched}} at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992, {{the concept of}} sustainability has exerted significant influence on policy at local level. Sustainable urban development has also become an important local strategy for global sustainability. Due to their integrative and forward-looking characteristics, sustainability indicators have been proposed to measure and evaluate urban development. After discussing the ecological economic dimension of urban sustainability, this paper presents a procedure and a conceptual framework of the indicator system for measuring Taipei's urban sustainability. On the basis of natural processes and evolving urban development, the approach to Taipei's sustainable development is defined as reinforcing Taipei's metropolitan life-support system through its economic vitality for enhancing Taipei's urban productivity and quality and making Taipei a national capital with blue-green characteristics. Based on the conceptual framework of urban ecological economic system, 80 indicators are selected through participation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), {{which can be used}} as policy-making indicators for measuring Taipei's urban sustainability. The policy-making indicators are further aggregated into 10 general public indicators and evaluated using signal lights (green, yellow and red). It is concluded that the proposed indicator system can provide evidence of progress on urban sustainability. <b>Justification</b> <b>of</b> public <b>expenditure</b> on urban development can therefore be evaluated.

40|$|Because {{of growing}} {{pressure}} on the healthcare budget in The Netherlands, appropriate <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> current <b>expenditures</b> and future investments in public healthcare are becoming increasingly important. Therefore, the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport is expanding its use of pharmacoeconomic evaluation in informed reimbursement decision-making of new pharmaceuticals. Since June 2002, pharmaceutical companies {{have been invited to}} submit a pharma-coeconomic dossier with their reimbursement applications of innovative drugs. As of January 2005 submission of a pharmacoeconomic dossier is mandatory for all drugs claiming to have therapeutic value. Currently, several European governmental and non-governmental organisations are making efforts to harmonise pharmacoeconomic research guidelines at the EU level. Ultimately, this may facilitate a more efficient way of conducting pharmacoeconomic research and encourage the use of pharmacoeconomic data by national assessment agencies and governments. It is anticipated that international pharmaceutical companies will increasingly invest in pharmacoeconomics while government staff will become more experienced in appraising the dossiers, thus resulting in an upward momentum in the quality and usability of pharmacoeconomic data. From the Dutch government's perspective, the use of pharmacoeconomic evaluation in reimbursement decision-making should offer a true opportunity for pharmaceutical companies to present the added value for money of new drugs. Using pharmacoeconomic data, costs, benefits and effects of pharmaceuticals are increasingly being considered from a societal perspective, thus going beyond the sole consideration of the impact on the pharmaceutical budget.

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to identify whether South African 3 star and above hotels are interested in forming alliances. The objective {{of this study was}} to group South African independent 3 star and above hotels on the alliance framework continuum, namely; cooperation, collaboration, coordination and coadunation; and to identify whether South African independent 3 star and above hotels are interested to progress from one simple form of alliance to the next complex, formal type of alliance. Hypotheses were proposed to determine the significance of the differences in preference of South African 3 star and above independent hotels. Thus, this study is descriptive in nature, to test the proposed hypotheses. An extensive investigation into the relevant literature was done. An empirical study was also conducted and the measuring instrument consisted of a selfadministered questionnaire. The population selected consisted of managers of these South African 3 star and above independent hotels. The major findings included: South African independent 3 star and above hotels seem to prefer niche personality and potential non-financial relationship, while they try to avoid economic and cultural integration with a partner firm and not interested in shared management control with the partner firm. Besides, four factors confirmed the alliance continuum developed by Bailey and Koney (2000), namely; cooperation, coordination, collaboration and coadunation. Friedman’s test indicated that there is significant difference among the different dimensions of alliance formation, namely; cooperation, collaboration, coordination and coadunation and that South African independent 3 star and above hotels are interested to form cooperation form of alliances mostly, followed by coordination form of alliances. South African independent 3 star and above hotels are neutral on whether to form collaboration type of alliances and they are not interested to involve in the coadunation form of alliances. Chi-square test indicated that there is no significant difference on the opinion of the respondents on whether the hotel they work for needs to progress from simpler form of alliances into more formal and complex format of alliances. However, those who preferred that their hotel has to progress from simpler form of alliance are higher in number than those who did not prefer. It was, inter alia, recommended that as South African 3 star and above hotels choose lower form of alliance, value chains seem the most applicable form of alliance. Hotels could share a name, reservation information and some basic IT facilities (point of sale IT reservation equipment and back office IT equipments). Finally, the study concludes by recommending that South African independent 3 star and above hotels should take alliances as an option for growth and <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> and decide the level of alliance continuum they want to engage in.

40|$|Background: In India {{because of}} growing {{pressure}} on the healthcare budget, appropriate <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> current <b>expenditures</b> and future investments in public healthcare are becoming a priority. COPD is {{a major cause of}} healthcare burden worldwide and it is the one of leading cause of death with increasing the prevalence. Objective: To evaluate the pharmacoeconomic impact of acute COPD exacerbations in a rural tertiary care hospital. Methodology: It is a prospective, observational study conducted in COPD in patients over a period of 9 months. The patients who satisfied the study criteria were enrolled. Results: Over all 50 were enrolled including 42 male and 8 female COPD patients. 60 %of patients stayed over a period of 6 - 10 days in hospital. 4 % of patients had a history of duration of illness > 10 years. 64 % of patients were farmers and only 4 % had a monthly income Rs. > 10000. 44 % had a history of past smoking and 6 % were smokers. 34 % of patients had co-morbidities with COPD. Minimum total direct medical cost was Rs. 188. 79 and maximum was Rs. 9982. 12 with a mean±SD 2510. 51 ± 1904. 11, in which medicine cost was high (mean 1949. 21). Minimum total direct non-medical cost was Rs. 10. 00 and maximum was Rs. 700. 00 with a mean±SD 154. 16 ± 166. 56, in which travel expenses was high (mean 84. 56). Maximum total direct cost was Rs. 10682. 12 and minimum was 268. 79 with a mean±SD 2664. 67 ± 2030. 76.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{some ideas}} {{developed in the}} field of public economics by French Sensationist political economists, from Turgot and Condorcet to the young Jean-Baptiste Say. An ideal-typical account of their position is {{based on the fact that}} issues raised by public expenditure and revenue are not dealt with independently. Instead, a strong link between the two sides of the budget is emphasized, an approach arising out of political considerations concerning human rights and equity. Following on from this they develop a theory <b>of</b> public <b>expenditure</b> based on public goods�-�national and local�-�and externalities, and a theory of taxation culminating in a <b>justification</b> <b>of</b> progressive taxation.
