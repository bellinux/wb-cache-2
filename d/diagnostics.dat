5|$|Until 1998, India did {{not have}} an {{adequate}} facility for diagnosis of genetic disorders, prevalent in the country. The fundamental research carried out by Singh and his colleagues in that area, led to conceptualization and establishment of the first DNA based diagnostic laboratory in the country. The lab later evolved into a separate institute, the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and <b>Diagnostics</b> in Hyderabad, India to provide advanced DNA based molecular <b>diagnostics</b> services for the nation.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, the {{identification}} of newly discovered genes and new techniques for DNA sequencing led to {{the appearance of a}} distinct field of molecular and genomic laboratory medicine; in 1995, the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) was formed to give it structure. In 1999, the AMP co-founded The Journal of Medical <b>Diagnostics.</b> Informa Healthcare launched Expert Reviews in Medical <b>Diagnostics</b> in 2001. From 2002 onwards, the HapMap Project aggregated information on the one-letter genetic differences that recur in the human populationthe single nucleotide polymorphismsand their relationship with disease. In 2012, molecular diagnostic techniques for Thalassemia use genetic hybridization tests to identify the specific single nucleotide polymorphism causing an individual's disease.|$|E
50|$|In Experiment 3, it was {{hypothesized}} that individuals with dysphoria would demonstrate better recall for highly <b>diagnostic</b> behaviors than low <b>diagnostic</b> behaviors. A highly <b>diagnostic</b> behavior is one that is very descriptive of a trait. For instance, “I can keep secrets” is highly <b>diagnostic</b> of the trait trustworthiness. A low <b>diagnostic</b> behavior for trustworthiness might be “I would take a pen from a bank after using it”. This experiment followed the same procedure as Experiment 1 except that half of the dysphoria patients were presented highly <b>diagnostic</b> behaviors and half were presented low <b>diagnostic</b> behaviors. As expected, the participants negative information was more easily recalled when the information was highly <b>diagnostic</b> as opposed to low <b>diagnostic.</b>|$|R

5|$|Molecular <b>diagnostics</b> {{are used}} to {{identify}} infectious diseases such as chlamydia, influenza virus and tuberculosis; or specific strains such as H1N1 virus. Genetic identification can be swift; for example a loop-mediated isothermal amplification test diagnoses the malaria parasite and is rugged enough for developing countries. But despite these advances in genome analysis, in 2013 infections are still more often identified by other meanstheir proteome, bacteriophage, or chromatographic profile. Molecular <b>diagnostics</b> are also used to understand the specific strain of the pathogenfor example by detecting which drug resistance genes it possessesand hence which therapies to avoid.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} {{molecular}} biology {{grew in the}} late twentieth century, as did its clinical application. In 1980, Yuet Wai Kan et al. suggested a prenatal genetic test for Thalassemia that did not rely upon DNA sequencingthen in its infancybut on restriction enzymes that cut DNA where they recognised specific short sequences, creating different lengths of DNA strand depending on which allele (genetic variation) the fetus possessed. In the 1980s, the phrase was used in the names of companies such as Molecular <b>Diagnostics</b> Incorporated and Bethseda Research Laboraties Molecular <b>Diagnostics.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{challenge}} for future successful GWA {{study is to}} apply the findings {{in a way that}} accelerates drug and <b>diagnostics</b> development, including better integration of genetic studies into the drug-development process and a focus on the role of genetic variation in maintaining health as a blueprint for designing new drugs and <b>diagnostics.</b> Several studies have looked into the use of risk-SNP markers as a means of directly improving the accuracy of prognosis. Some have found that the accuracy of prognosis improves, while others report only minor benefits from this use. Generally, a problem with this direct approach is the small magnitudes of the effects observed. A small effect ultimately translates into a poor separation of cases and controls and thus only a small improvement of prognosis accuracy. An alternative application is therefore the potential for GWA studies to elucidate pathophysiology.|$|E

5|$|As the {{commercial}} application of molecular <b>diagnostics</b> {{has become more}} important, so has the debate about patenting of the genetic discoveries at its heart. In 1998, the European Union's Directive 98/44/ECclarified that patents on DNA sequences were allowable. In 2010 in the US, AMP sued Myriad Genetics to challenge the latter's patents regarding two genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, which are associated with breast cancer. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court partially agreed, ruling that a naturally occurring gene sequence could not be patented.|$|E
5|$|Because {{molecular}} <b>diagnostics</b> {{methods can}} detect sensitive markers, these tests are less intrusive than a traditional biopsy. For example, because cell-free nucleic acids exist in human plasma, a simple blood sample can {{be enough to}} sample genetic information from tumours, transplants or an unborn fetus. Many, but not all, molecular <b>diagnostics</b> methods based on nucleic acids detection use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to vastly {{increase the number of}} nucleic acid molecules, thereby amplifying the target sequence(s) in the patient sample. The detection of the marker might use real time PCR, direct sequencing, or microarray chipsprefabricated chips that test many markers at once. The same principle applies to the proteome and the genome. High-throughput protein arrays can use complementary DNA or antibodies to bind and hence can detect many different proteins in parallel.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{prenatal}} {{tests for}} chromosomal abnormalities such as Down Syndrome rely on analysing {{the number and}} appearance of the chromosomesthe karyotype. Molecular <b>diagnostics</b> tests such as microarray comparative genomic hybridisation test a sample of DNA instead, and because of cell-free DNA in plasma, could be less invasive, but as of 2013 it is still an adjunct to the conventional tests.|$|E

40|$|<b>Diagnostic</b> tests specify {{whether a}} person has a {{specific}} disease or not and it extremely contribute decision-making of the intervention.

5|$|Detection of {{particular}} antibodies {{is a very}} common form of medical <b>diagnostics,</b> and applications such as serology depend on these methods. For example, in biochemical assays for disease diagnosis, a titer of antibodies directed against Epstein-Barr virus or Lyme disease is estimated from the blood.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Knowing about a <b>diagnostic</b> {{probability}} requires {{general knowledge}} about {{the way in which}} the probability depends on the <b>diagnostic</b> indicators involved in the specification of the case at issue. <b>Diagnostic</b> probability functions (DPFs) are generally unavailable at present. Our objective was to illustrate how <b>diagnostic</b> experts' case-specific tacit knowledge about <b>diagnostic</b> probabilities could be garnered in the form of DPFs. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Focusing on diagnosis of acute coronary heart disease (ACHD), we presented doctors with extensive experience in hospitals' emergency departments a set of hypothetical cases specified in terms of an inclusive set of <b>diagnostic</b> indicators. We translated the medians of these experts' case-specific probabilities into a logistic DPF for ACHD. RESULTS: The principal result was the experts' typical <b>diagnostic</b> probability for ACHD as a joint function of the set of <b>diagnostic</b> indicators. A related result of note was the finding that the experts' probabilities in any given case had a surprising degree of variability. CONCLUSION: Garnering <b>diagnostic</b> experts' case-specific tacit knowledge about <b>diagnostic</b> probabilities in the form of DPFs is feasible to accomplish. Thus, once the methodology of this type of work has been "perfected," practice-guiding <b>diagnostic</b> expert systems can be developed...|$|R
