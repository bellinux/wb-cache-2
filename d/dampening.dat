5|$|A natural form {{of large}} scale {{environmental}} shading/dimming {{has been identified}} that affected the 2006 northern hemisphere hurricane season. The NASA study found that several major dust storms in June and July in the Sahara desert sent dust drifting over the Atlantic Ocean and through several effects caused cooling of the waters, thus <b>dampening</b> the development of hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} solid, fast {{decaying}} sounds are produced using <b>dampening</b> techniques. The desired effect is produced after striking the knob, by leaving one’s hand or knee or the mallets themselves on it. When one player is using two gongs, the assistant holding the lower-pitched gong positions it {{at an angle}} and dampens its surface using their hands.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies of}} the Zenbooks are made of aluminium, chosen for its light weight, strength, {{vibration}} <b>dampening,</b> appearance and acoustic properties. Both the bodies and lids are CNC milled and brushed for appearance. Reviewers have noted the resulting superior rigidity and complimented {{the appearance of the}} Zenbook range. The lid is available in three colours: dark silver/purple (pictured), rose gold and hot pink.|$|E
50|$|Although Leech has {{at times}} not <b>dampened</b> non-mutants like the Fantastic Four, Leech {{has also been}} shown to <b>dampen</b> {{abilities}} that are non-mutant in origin. Leech <b>dampened</b> Hazmat of the Avengers Academy, and during Marvel's Mutant Massacre crossover event, Leech negated the powers of the superhero team Power Pack, whose abilities were bestowed on them by an extraterrestrial.|$|R
30|$|The {{results are}} {{consistent}} for both macro-level and individual-level mismatch in that higher or more imbalanced job polarization (i.e., stronger upgrading) tends to <b>dampen</b> mismatch. Note that when we claim that polarization <b>dampens</b> mismatch at the individual level, we focus on ISCO-based overeducation.|$|R

5|$|As Voyager {{installs}} the Isodesium, a ship is {{sent from}} the Forge to tear Voyager apart for resources. Tuvok leads the Hazard Team {{to a nearby}} derelict dreadnought gunship to use the gunship's weaponry to destroy the incoming ship, but is only successful in disabling it as it attaches to Voyager. Voyager is consequently swarmed by crab-like aliens intent on carrying off crew and cargo, although the crew manages to eliminate these aliens. Munro prompts the captain to counterattack, in order to destroy the <b>dampening</b> field projected by the station. The Hazard Team uses the Forge's ship to infiltrate the Forge and disable its defensive systems, allowing the Voyager crew to attack using shuttlecraft; however, Crewman Biessman is killed while waiting for Voyagers reinforcements. The Forge's power core is destroyed, thereby dropping the <b>dampening</b> field. Munro, however, learns of the species behind the Forge, the Vohrsoth, and the station's true purpose: to harvest the genetic features of those trapped by the Forge to create an army designed for conquering the galaxy. Munro disobeys orders to ensure the Vohrsoth cannot recreate the Forge and kills the Vohrsoth commander. With power restored, Voyager attacks the Forge and destroys the station, beaming Munro off {{in the last few}} moments. Voyager and other active ships in the area are freed, and Munro is promoted to lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|The <b>dampening</b> {{of public}} enthusiasm for freak shows and human oddities {{continued}} {{and the police}} and magistrates became increasingly vigilant in closing shows down. Merrick remained a horrifying spectacle for his viewers and Roper grew nervous about the negative attention the Elephant Man drew from local authorities. Merrick's group of managers decided that he should go on tour in Continental Europe, {{with the hope that}} authorities there would be more lenient. Merrick's management was assumed by an unknown man (possibly named Ferrari) and they left for the Continent. The Elephant Man was no more successful there than in Britain, and similar action was taken by authorities to move him out of their jurisdictions. In Brussels, Merrick was deserted by this new manager, who stole Merrick's £50 (2015 equivalent £) savings. Abandoned, Merrick made his way by train to Ostend, where he attempted to board a ferry for Dover but was refused passage. He travelled to Antwerp and was able to board a ship bound for Harwich in Essex. From there, he travelled by train to London and arrived at Liverpool Street station.|$|E

5000|$|Apagados (from the Spanish verb apagar, [...] "to mute") {{refers to}} notes that are played <b>dampened</b> or [...] "muted," [...] without sustain. The term is written {{above or below}} the notes with a dotted or dashed line drawn {{to the end of}} the group of notes that are to be played <b>dampened.</b> The {{technique}} is chiefly written for bowed or plucked instruments. Modernists refer to the apogado as [...] "palm mute." [...] On the guitar, the musician <b>dampens</b> the strings with the palm of the hand and plucks with the thumb. Strictly speaking, the term <b>dampened</b> is correct for this effect in music; since to mute means to silence. Illustration of the apagados may be found in the work of composer for Spanish guitar, Gerardo de Altona.

25|$|The {{plate is}} affixed to a {{cylinder}} on a printing press. <b>Dampening</b> rollers apply water, which covers the blank {{portions of the}} plate but is repelled by the emulsion of the image area.

The {{most widely}} used glazing configurations for sound <b>dampening</b> include laminated glass with varied thickness of the interlayer and thickness of the glass. Including a structural, thermally improved aluminum thermal barrier air spacer in the insulating glass can improve acoustical performance by reducing the transmission of exterior noise sources in the fenestration system.|$|E

Several have been built in recent years (one is at Cables in Western Australia), and there is widespread enthusiasm in the global surfing community for additional projects.

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that astrocytes play an {{important}} function in the regulation of neural stem cells. Research from the Schepens Eye Research Institute at Harvard shows the human brain to abound in neural stem cells, which are kept in a dormant state by chemical signals (ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A3) from the astrocytes. The astrocytes are able to activate the stem cells to transform into working neurons by <b>dampening</b> the release of ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A3.|$|E
25|$|Since timpani {{have a long}} sustain, {{muffling}} or <b>dampening</b> is {{an inherent}} part of playing. Often, timpanists will muffle notes so they only sound for the length indicated by the composer. However, early timpani did not resonate nearly as long as modern timpani, so composers often wrote a note when the timpanist was to hit the drum without concern for sustain. Today, timpanists must use their ear and the score to determine the length the note should sound.|$|E

25|$|Although {{some early}} vibes players {{made use of}} four mallets, notably Red Norvo, Adrian Rollini, and {{sometimes}} Lionel Hampton, the fully pianistic four-mallet approach is almost entirely the creation of Burton. Many of the key techniques of the four-mallet style, such as multi-linear playing and the advanced <b>dampening</b> techniques described below, are easily applied to playing with two mallets and some modern two-mallet players have adapted these devices to their playing, somewhat blurring the distinctions between modern two- and four-mallet players.|$|E
25|$|The Royalist {{victory was}} capped when they hauled off {{considerable}} military stores {{abandoned by the}} fleeing communists, including half a dozen armored cars and eight artillery pieces. However, the route to the Plain of Jars was still blocked by communist forces. As a result, there were hard feelings on part of the RLA regulars, who felt cheated of their triumph. Nor was that the only factor <b>dampening</b> Royalist morale; the Tonkin Gulf Incident of 2 August that officially began the Vietnam War immediately overshadowed Operation Triangle.|$|E
