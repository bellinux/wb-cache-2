5|$|Among {{the first}} devices {{external}} to the human body that are considered <b>instruments</b> are rattles, stampers, and various drums. These earliest <b>instruments</b> evolved due to the human motor impulse to add sound to emotional movements such as dancing. Eventually, some cultures assigned ritual functions to their musical <b>instruments,</b> using them for hunting and various ceremonies. Those cultures developed more complex percussion <b>instruments</b> and other <b>instruments</b> such as ribbon reeds, flutes, and trumpets. Some of these labels carry far different connotations from those used in modern day; early flutes and trumpets are so-labeled for their basic operation and function rather than any resemblance to modern <b>instruments.</b> Among early cultures for whom drums developed ritual, even sacred importance are the Chukchi people of the Russian Far East, the indigenous people of Melanesia, and many cultures of Africa. In fact, drums were pervasive throughout every African culture. One East African tribe, the Wahinda, believed it was so holy that seeing a drum would be fatal to any person other than the sultan.|$|E

5|$|During the Classical and Romantic {{periods of}} music, lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900, {{a great deal}} of musical <b>instruments</b> capable of {{producing}} new timbres and higher volume were developed and introduced into popular music.

The Byzantine lyra, a bowed string instrument, is an ancestor of most European bowed <b>instruments,</b> including the violin.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{of musical}} <b>instruments</b> in use by early civilizations of India is almost {{completely}} lacking, {{making it impossible}} to reliably attribute <b>instruments</b> to the Munda and Dravidian language-speaking cultures that first settled the area. Rather, the history of musical <b>instruments</b> in the area begins with the Indus Valley Civilization that emerged around 3000 BC. Various rattles and whistles found among excavated artifacts are the only physical evidence of musical <b>instruments.</b> A clay statuette indicates the use of drums, and examination of the Indus script has also revealed representations of vertical arched harps identical in design to those depicted in Sumerian artifacts. This discovery is among many indications that the Indus Valley and Sumerian cultures maintained cultural contact. Subsequent developments in musical <b>instruments</b> in India occurred with the Rigveda, or hymns. These songs used various drums, shell trumpets, harps, and flutes. Other prominent <b>instruments</b> in use during the early centuries AD were the snake charmer's double clarinet, bagpipes, barrel drums, cross flutes, and short lutes. In all, India had no unique musical <b>instruments</b> until the Middle Ages.|$|E

5000|$|There is some {{confusion}} about the <b>instrument</b> to which the name was originally applied.

He also described an <b>instrument</b> that measured both altitude and azimuth, which he called a topographicall <b>instrument</b> [...] Thus the name originally applied only to the azimuth <b>instrument</b> and only later became associated with the altazimuth <b>instrument.</b> The 1728 Cyclopaedia compares [...] "graphometer" [...] to [...] "half-theodolite".

5|$|Generally, {{performances}} can {{be classified}} as either formal ones or informal. During formal performances adherents follow a traditional set of rules that would govern playing and it usually involved people from outside the home. Informal performances are quite the opposite. The strict rules that normally govern play are often ignored and the performers are usually between people well acquainted with one another, usually close family members. These performances usually were times when amateurs practiced on the <b>instruments,</b> young boys and girls gathered the <b>instruments,</b> substituting the kulintang with the saronay and inubab. Ensembles didn’t necessary have to have five <b>instruments</b> like formal performances: they could be composed of only four <b>instruments</b> (three gandingan gongs, a kulintang, an agung, and a dabakan), three <b>instruments</b> (a kulintang, a dabakan, and either an agung or three gandingan gongs) or simply just one instrument (kulintang solo).|$|E

5|$|Images {{of musical}} <b>instruments</b> begin {{to appear in}} Mesopotamian {{artifacts}} in 2800 BC or earlier. Beginning around 2000 BC, Sumerian and Babylonian cultures began delineating two distinct classes of musical <b>instruments</b> due to division of labor and the evolving class system. Popular <b>instruments,</b> simple and playable by anyone, evolved differently from professional <b>instruments</b> whose development focused on effectiveness and skill.

Greeks played a variety of wind <b>instruments</b> they classified as aulos (reeds) or syrinx (flutes); Greek writing from that time reflects a serious study of reed production and playing technique. Romans played reed <b>instruments</b> named tibia, featuring side-holes that could be opened or closed, allowing for greater flexibility in playing modes.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to develop an Adjustment Assessment <b>Instrument</b> for Omani College Students. The adjustment <b>instrument</b> items were constructed and grouped into academic, family, social and personal adjustment areas common to Omani college students. The content validity of the adjustment <b>instrument</b> was determined by utilizing two Delphi panels. The first panel examined the <b>instrument</b> items which represented Omani students' adjustment areas. The second panel determined the <b>instrument</b> items' content domains and the appropriateness of their dimensions. The revised 190 item <b>instrument</b> was administered to 30 Omani Students at Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) in order to test the wording of the items and determine the actual time for the completion of the <b>instrument.</b> One item was dropped from the <b>instrument</b> leaving 189 items, including 70 positive and 119 negative items. The developed adjustment <b>instrument</b> was administered to 400 Omani students at SQU. Internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability for the developed <b>instrument</b> were investigated. The test-retest reliability was determined by administering the <b>instrument</b> to 37 subjects using two week intervals between the two tests. In addition to reliability consideration, construct validity was determined by examining (a) <b>instrument</b> dimensionality, (b) factor analysis, (c) item analysis, and (d) internal consistency. The results revealed that the developed adjustment <b>instrument</b> possessed high reliability estimation which was adequate for individual measurement. In addition, the results supported the construct validity of the <b>instrument</b> as an adjustment measure. The results of the correlation matrix of the developed four dimensions and of the inter-factor correlation of the adjustment questionnaire provided evidence for the multidimensionality of the <b>instrument.</b> Also, factor analysis results confirmed that the developed <b>instrument</b> consisted of four dimensions: academic, family, social and personal adjustment. Moreover, item-total correlation finalized the <b>instrument,</b> which included 58 items, of which 25 were positive and 32 negative.
