Producers Barbara Boyle and Michael Taylor were preparing to bring the book to the <b>film</b> <b>screen</b> for Touchstone Pictures, a division of Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group. Boyle and Taylor had previously worked with actor John Travolta on the film Phenomenon, and the project was planned {{to be part of}} Travolta's vision to make films out of L. Ron Hubbard's science fiction novels. Hubbard's novel Battlefield Earth was first on his list, and Travolta starred in and helped fund the film version of the book which was released in 2000. A film version of To the Stars had not yet begun production as of 2008.|$|E

500|$|McCay {{originally}} used {{a version}} of the film as part of his vaudeville act. [...] The first performance was on February8, 1914, in Chicago at the Palace Theater. [...] McCay began the show making his customary live sketches, which he followed with How a Mosquito Operates. [...] He then appeared on stage with a whip and lectured the audience on the making of animation. [...] Standing {{to the right of the}} <b>film</b> <b>screen,</b> he introduced [...] "the only dinosaur in captivity". [...] As the film started Gertie poked her head out of a cave, and McCay encouraged her to come forward. [...] He reinforced the illusion with tricks such as tossing a cardboard apple at the screen, at which point he turned his back to the audience and pocketed the apple as it appeared in the film for Gertie to eat. [...] For the finale, McCay walked offstage from where he [...] "reappeared" [...] in the film; Gertie lifted up the animated McCay, placed him on her back, and walked away as McCay bowed to the audience.|$|E
500|$|Subwoofers {{received}} {{a great deal}} of publicity in 1974 with the movie Earthquake which was released in Sensurround. Initially installed in 17 U.S. theaters, the Cerwin Vega [...] "Sensurround" [...] system used large subwoofers which were driven by racks of 500 watt amplifiers which were triggered by control tones printed on one of the audio tracks on the film. Four of the subwoofers were positioned in front of the audience under (or behind) the <b>film</b> <b>screen</b> and two more were placed together {{at the rear of the}} audience on a platform. Powerful noise energy and loud rumbling in the range of 17Hz to 120Hz was generated at the level of 110–120 decibels of sound pressure level, abbreviated dB(SPL). The new low frequency entertainment method helped the film become a box office success. More Sensurround systems were assembled and installed. By 1976 there were almost 300 Sensurround systems leapfrogging through select theaters. Other films to use the effect include the WW II naval battle epic Midway in 1976 and Rollercoaster in 1977. Deep bass speakers were once an exotic commodity owned by audiophiles. By the mid-1990s, they were much more popular and widely used, [...] with different sizes and capabilities of sound output.|$|E
