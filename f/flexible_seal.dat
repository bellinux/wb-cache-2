25|$|The main {{change from}} {{previous}} missions {{is the change}} of the Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate (GUCP) vent housing. The quick release vents exhibited leaks during STS-119 and STS-127, which were determined {{to be due to}} a misalignment in the vent. This led to the one part rigid seal in the external tank being replaced with a two part <b>flexible</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|E
50|$|A later method {{developed}} for solid propellant ballistic missiles achieves thrust vectoring by deflecting the rocket nozzle using electric servomechanisms or hydraulic cylinders. The nozzle {{is attached to}} the missile via a ball joint with a hole in the center, or a <b>flexible</b> <b>seal</b> made of a thermally resistant material, the latter generally requiring more torque and a higher power actuation system. The Trident C4 and D5 systems are controlled via hydraulically actuated nozzle.|$|E
5000|$|Water leakage: Top-loading {{machines}} are {{less prone to}} leakage, because simple gravity can reliably keep water from spilling out the loading door on top. True front-loading machines require a <b>flexible</b> <b>seal</b> or gasket on the front door, and the front door must be locked during operation to prevent opening, lest large amounts of water spill out. This seal may leak and require replacement. However, many current front-loaders use so little water {{that they can be}} stopped mid-cycle for addition or removal of laundry, while keeping the water level in the horizontal tub below the door level. Best practice installations of either type of machine will include a floor drain or an overflow catch tray with a drain connection, since neither design is immune to leakage or a solenoid valve getting stuck in the open position.|$|E

40|$|The Seacoaster {{combines}} the high efficiencies of Surface Effect Ships (SES) with simple catamaran hull construction. It has blower pressurized air cushions that support some 80 - 90 percent of displacement {{and hence the}} high efficiencies. However, unlike the SES, there are no expensive and high maintenance <b>flexible</b> <b>seals.</b> Each catamaran sidehull has a simple recess molded or built into its underside. Powered blowers direct pressurized air into such recesses and thereby create lifting air cushions. There are no <b>flexible</b> <b>seals</b> of any kind {{and there is no}} air cushion between the sidehulls. Extensive towed model tests were conducted that showed the viability of the invention...|$|R
50|$|A wetsuit {{must have}} a snug fit to work {{efficiently}} when immersed; too loose a fit, particularly at the openings (wrists, ankles, neck and overlaps) will allow cold water from the outside to enter continuously. <b>Flexible</b> <b>seals</b> at the suit cuffs aid in preventing heat loss in this fashion.|$|R
40|$|The NASA Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) uses an omniaxial <b>flexible</b> <b>seal</b> for {{vectoring}} the nozzle.

Since no test history on the particular type of <b>flexible</b> <b>seal</b> being used was available and since <b>flexible</b> <b>seal</b> dynamics characteristics affect many vehicle hardware design and manufacture requirements, a rigorous test program to assess the integrity and operating characteristics of the seal was developed and executed. Vector requirements of the SRM <b>flexible</b> <b>seal</b> and results of subscale and full-scale prototype seal verification tests are included. The advantages of an improved method of calculating actuator stroke versus vector angle and pressure over the more classical method of calculating actuator strokes using pivot point envelopes are discussed.

50|$|Since {{the advent}} of a postal system, the use of sealing wax has become more for {{ceremony}} than security.

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{theoretical}} analysis of the hinge-moment characteristics of various sealed-internal-balance arrangements for control surfaces are presented. The analysis considered overhands sealed to various types of wing structure by flexible seals spanning gaps of various widths or sealed to the wing structure by a flexible system of linked plates. Leakage was not considered; the seal was assumed to extend the full spanwise length of the control surface. The effect of the developed width of the <b>flexible</b> <b>seal</b> and of the geometry of the structure to which the seal was anchored was investigated, {{as well as the}} effect of the gap width that is sealed. The results of the investigation indicated that the most nearly linear control-surface hinge-moment characteristics can probably be obtained from a <b>flexible</b> <b>seal</b> over a narrow gap (about 0. 1 of the overhang chord), which is so installed that the motion of the seal is restricted to a region behind the point of attachment of the seal to the wing structure. Control-surface hinge moments that tend to be high at large deflections and low or overbalanced at small deflections will result if a very narrow seal is used...|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} bushing designs use electro porcelain {{for both}} {{indoor and outdoor}} applications. Porcelain is impervious to moisture once sealed by fired glaze and is low cost and flexible to manufacture.

40|$|Most {{air duct}} system {{components}} are {{assembled in the}} field and are mechanically fastened by sheet metal screws (for sheet metal-to-sheet metal) or by drawbands (for flex duct-to-sheet metal). Air sealing is separate from this mechanical fastening and is usually achieved using tape or mastic products after mechanical fastening. Field observations have shown that mechanical fastening rarely meets code or manufacturers requirements and that sealing procedures are similarly inconsistent. To address these problems, Proctor Engineering Group (PEG) is developing a system of joining ducts (called PEGIT) that combines the mechanical fastening and sealing into a single self-contained procedure. The PEGIT system uses a shaped <b>flexible</b> <b>seal</b> between specially designed sheet metal duct fittings to both seal and fasten duct sections together. Figure 1 shows the inner duct fitting complete with rubber seal. This seal provides the air seal for the completed fitting and is shaped to allow the inner and outer fittings to slide together, and then to lock the fittings in place. The illustration in Figure 2 shows the approximate cross section of the rubber seal that shows how the seal has a lip that is angled backwards. This angled lip allows the joint to be pushed together by folding flat but then its long axis makes it stiff in the pulling apart direction. This study was undertaken to assist PEG in some of the design aspects of this system and to test the performance of the PEGIT system. This study was carried out in three phases. The initial phase evaluated the performance of a preliminary seal design for the PEGIT system. After the first phase, the seal was redesigned and this new seal was evaluated in the second phase of testing. The third phase performed more detailed testing of the second seal design to optimize the production tolerances of the sheet metal fittings. This report summarizes our findings from the first two phases and provides details about the third phase of testing...|$|E

Replacement of these seals {{can be difficult}} to impossible, due to IG windows commonly using extruded channel frames without seal retention screws or plates. Instead, the edge seals are installed by pushing an arrow-shaped indented one-way flexible lip into a slot on the extruded channel, and often cannot be easily extracted from the extruded slot to be replaced.|$|R
