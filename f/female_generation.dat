We will further take 20 years as being 4.5 years earlier than the average time of marriage, and 29 years as 4.5 years later than it, so that the length of each generation of the A group will be 27 years, and that of the B group will be 36 years. All these suppositions appear to be perfectly fair and reasonable, while it may easily be shown that any other suppositions within the bounds of probability would lead to results of the same general order.|$|E

40|$|Entrepreneurship is {{considered}} a vital driving force for stimulating economic growth, economic competitiveness and for creating employment opportunities. Consequently, {{the creation of new}} ventures and the growth of existing entrepreneurial businesses are vital contributing factors to a robust economy. Female entrepreneurship, in particular, is a phenomenon that is viewed as a driving force in the economy because it has a significant effect on employment growth and the global business environment. More specifically, female entrepreneurs are perceived as important agents of social and economic change, significantly contributing to the world economic development in terms of employment generation, innovation and wealth. Understanding <b>female</b> <b>Generation</b> Y students‟ inclination towards entrepreneurship from an emerging and developed economy makes an important contribution in that it will help better tailor marketing strategies designed to stimulate interest in entrepreneurship amongst female students. As such, the primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine and compare undergraduate university <b>female</b> <b>Generation</b> Y students‟ inclination towards entrepreneurship in the South African and the Netherland’s context in order to facilitate the creation of a strong entrepreneurial climate amongst South African <b>female</b> <b>Generation</b> Y students. For the purpose of this study, two samples were conveniently selected, namely Sample South Africa (SA) and Sample Netherlands (NL). A non-probability, convenience sample of 400 South African Generation Y female students (Sample SA) and 400 Generation Y female students from the Netherlands (Sample NL) were drawn in order to conduct this study. In both the South African and Netherland’s samples, the questionnaires were divided equally between the two HEIs sampled per country. A structured self-administered questionnaire was utilised to gather the required data for this study. This questionnaire comprised scales measuring Generation Y students‟ motivations, perceived barriers and attitudes towards entrepreneurship. The collected data were analysed using exploratory factor analysis, reliability and validity analysis, descriptive statistics analysis, correlation analysis, logistic regression analysis and a two independent-samples t-test. The findings of this study suggest that independence motives, intrinsic motives and personal motivational barriers have a significant influence on <b>female</b> <b>Generation</b> Y cohort members‟ entrepreneurial interest. In addition, the findings of this study suggest that economic and financial barriers, positive attitudes, extrinsic motives, personal competence barriers, organisational barriers, entry barriers and negative attitudes do not have a significant influence on <b>female</b> <b>Generation</b> Y cohort members‟ entrepreneurial interest. Furthermore, the findings of this study indicate no statistically significant difference between South African and Dutch female students concerning perceived economic and financial barriers as a determinant of entrepreneurial inclination. However, in comparison to Sample NL, South African <b>female</b> <b>Generation</b> Y students (Sample SA) scored a statistically significant higher means for independence motives, extrinsic motives, intrinsic motives, personal motivational barriers, personal competence barriers, organisational barriers, entry barriers, positive attitudes and negative attitudes. This model developed in this study represents an important tool for predicting the Generation Y female student cohort’s entrepreneurial inclination in both the South African and the Netherlands context. In addition, the recommendations emanating from the study will enable HEIs and industry professionals, such as business incubator managers, academics and incubator managers to tailor marketing strategies designed to stimulate interest in entrepreneurship as well as tailor entrepreneurship programmes towards the <b>female</b> <b>generation</b> cohort in South Africa and the Netherlands.

40|$|Abstract: The South African {{retail banking}} {{industry}} is a highly competitive environment where major industry players compete for the largest market share of the banked and unbanked consumer market. The consumer segment of focus {{in this study is}} the <b>female</b> <b>Generation</b> Y consumer, due to their high disposable incomes, technological savviness, and brand consciousness. Within the retail banking industry in South Africa, the number of formally banked female consumers has increased to 87 %, and is noted as being significantly higher than the number of formally banked male consumers, which is 81 %. To maintain the largest market share, the major South African retail banks must determine the factors and variables that influence the <b>female</b> <b>Generation</b> Y consumer’s selection of a retail bank, so as to attract consumers from competing retail banks, as well as proactively prevent the attrition of their current consumers. The primary objective {{of the study was to}} determine the factors that had an influence of the <b>female</b> <b>Generation</b> Y consumer’s selection of a retail bank using consumers residing in the Gauteng province. The aim of the study was to identify the factor dimensions for purchase intention when selecting a retail bank. These factor dimensions were identified, through a literature review and previous studies, namely price, product selection, innovation, status, and peer referral. A descriptive research approach was followed and data was gathered, using quantitative research methods. A self-administered questionnaire was administered through convenience sampling to research participants at universities, shopping malls, and banking halls, within the Gauteng province. The target population for this study was limited to research participants between the ages of 18 and 36 years, who held a bank account with one of the five major South African retail banks (ABSA, FNB, Standard Bank, Nedbank, and Capitec Bank). A total of 300 questionnaires were distributed and 274 were retained for data analysis. Pearson product moment correlation analysis and regression analysis were used to test the influence of the relationships between various variables in the study. The peer referral subscale developed as a two-factor solution and was split into recommendation and trustworthiness. The remaining subscales were all considered valid [...] . M. Com.

Therefore, in this study, the researcher focuses the different age cohorts in Chinese female consumers to find out the insights in regard to the luxury fashion products purchasing. Methodology – The researcher used Means Ranking, Two independent sample T-test and Factor Analysis in order to accomplish the objectives in this study. A method snowball sampling is applied for the data collection. Findings – The results indicate that, overall, Chinese female consumers nowadays attach more importance into the personal level. Also, experiential and functional aspects of luxury fashion products purchase is closely linked to the purchasing motivation. Practical Implications – This study offers new empirical support for the proposition that there is a tendency of shifting from China’s consuming culture to Western society’s consuming culture.

40|$|Familial {{hypoparathyroidism}} is {{an unusual}} and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that may be isolated or {{may be associated with}} congenital or acquired abnormalities in other organs or glands. We have evaluated a family with a novel syndrome of autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism, short stature, and premature osteoarthritis. A 74 -yr-old <b>female</b> (<b>generation</b> I) presented with hypoparathyroidism, a movement disorder secondary to ectopic calcification of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, and a history of knee and hip replacements for osteoarthritis. Two members of generation II and one member of generation III were also documented with hypoparathyroidism, short stature, and premature osteoarthritis evident as early as 11 yr. Because of the known association between autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism and activating mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) gene, further studies were performed. Sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA revealed a leucine to valine substitution at position 616 in the first transmembrane domain of the CaR, which cosegregated with the disorder. However, this amino acid sequence change did not affect the total accumulation of inositol phosphates as a function of extracellular calcium concentrations in transfected HEK- 293 cells. In conclusion, a sequence alteration in the coding region of the CaR gene was identified, but is not conclusively involved in the etiology of this novel syndrome. The cosegregation of hypoparathyroidism, short stature, and osteoarthritis in this kindred does suggest a genetic abnormality involving a common molecular mechanism in parathyroid, bone, and cartilage...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{signals to}} {{maternal}} organisms {{can result in}} developmental alterations in progeny. One such example is environmental sex determination in Branchiopod crustaceans. We previously demonstrated that the hormone methyl farnesoate could orchestrate environmental sex determination in the early embryo to the male phenotype. Presently, we identify a transcription factor that is activated by methyl farnesoate and explore the extent and significance of this transgenerational signaling pathway. Several candidate transcription factors were cloned from the water flea Daphnia pulex and evaluated for activation by methyl farnesoate. One of the factors evaluated, the complex of two bHLH-PAS proteins, dappuMet and SRC, activated a reporter gene in response to methyl farnesoate. Several juvenoid compounds were definitively evaluated {{for their ability to}} activate this receptor complex (methyl farnesoate receptor, MfR) in vitro and stimulate male sex determination in vivo. Potency to activate the MfR correlated to potency to stimulate male sex determination of offspring (pyriproxyfen>methyl farnesoate>methoprene, kinoprene). Daphnids were exposed to concentrations of pyriproxyfen and physiologic responses determined over multiple generations. Survivial, growth, and sex of maternal organisms were not affected by pyriproxyfen exposure. Sex ratio among offspring (generation 2) were increasingly skewed in favor of males with increasing pyriproxyfen concentration; while, the number of offspring per brood was progressively reduced. <b>Female</b> <b>generation</b> 2 daphnids were reared to reproductive maturity in the absence of pyriproxyfen. Sex ratios of offspring (generation 3) were not affected in this pyriproxyfen lineage, however, the number of offspring per brood, again, was significantly reduced. Results reveal likely components to a hormone/receptor signaling pathway in a crustacean that orchestrates transgenerational modifications to important population metrics (sex ratios, fecundity of females). A model is provided that describes how these signaling processes can facilitate population sustainability under normal conditions or threaten sustainability when perturbed by environmental chemicals...|$|E

The majority of the research occurred in Haro Strait in the San Juan Islands. All whales were individually identifiable from naturally occurring marks and scars on the dorsal fin and back. Many whales were identified visually in the field {{with the aid of}} a photographic guide to individuals (Biggs et al. 1987). Seventy-two whales comprised the study population. Data collection concentrated on group composition and spacing, identification and associations of all whales present, and the recording of the dominant behavior occurring at that time. Behaviors were categorized from combinations of quantifiable parameters of group composition, spacing of individuals, speed and direction of travel, and the occurrence of specific behaviors such as leaps, tail slaps, penile erections, etc. (Osborne 1986). Behaviors were pooled into four major groups: feeding, travel, rest and social/sexual behaviors. The results suggest the following hypothesis about the social organization of the killer whales resident to Greater Puget Sound. As a whale ages, it moves from an integrated position within the community, based on its relationship with its mother to a less integrated period during adolescence in which social ties remain primarily through the older <b>female</b> <b>generation.</b> With full adulthood, dependency upon these “allo-mothers” (N.

Close associations between adult whales appear to be based on relationship between direct kin. Fission from the main material sub-group and the establishment of separate subgroups may be the result of several factors including the age of the older female and the number, ages, and sex of her offspring, including adult sons.

Three owner groups in Ruvhten Sijte have selected calves at the autumn slaughter every year since 1986 by retaining heavy calves. They own approximately 45 % of the reindeer in Ruvhten Sijte. The other owners do not select on recorded weights, and all animals mix during the mating season. The recorded data on calf weights (1986 to 1997) consisted of 12 484 observations, with mean selection differentials of 2. 9 kg and 4. 6 kg for female and male calves, respectively (phenotypic standard deviation equal to 4. 4 kg). The <b>female</b> <b>generation</b> interval was 6. 4 years. In 1996 and 1997, autumn live weights of calves owned by herders applying selection (n = 971) were compared with the weights of calves owned by herders not applying selection (n = 1125). The observed difference was 0. 67 kg (total mean = 42. 6 kg), of which 0. 32 kg was {{due to differences in}} dam age structure between the two types of herds, therefore the estimated difference in selection {{response was}} 0. 35 kg.

40|$|Patriarchal values: {{girls are}} more apt to change How has the family value system changed between generations, {{especially}} when taking into account the gender dimension? This article presents some results from a study carried outin 2007 in one village of the Gourani tribe where the people are followers of Ahle Hagh in Islamabad Gharb (west of Iran). The differences between generations (those born and raised before and after the Islamic Revolution) in patriarchal values in the family are statistically significant. The older generation opts for the man of the family to make most of the decisions; on children’s education, marriage, naming, the families expenditure, the place for residence, the social network of the family and even the number of children. The younger generation has a different value system and it has moved towards a more egalitarian type of family. With the gender variable included in the findings we see that although the values of the younger male population have evolved toward a less patriarchal decision making structure inthe family, the degree of changes among the young women is much higher. Looking into the preferences for male sex for the first child as well as a larger number of boys in the family, the difference between generations is significant. However data on the differences analyzed with the gender variable proves that the changes concerning the equality of sexes are mainly due to drastic changes in the young women’s value system. That is, the male population, young or old, still prefer to have a boy as their first born and to have more sons in the family. But the young <b>female</b> <b>generation</b> in the rural area sees less difference in having boys or girls in the family. It is concluded that reforms in the old value system is an evolving process of everyday life and that the girls are the main social force for change. Sociologisk Forsknings digitala arkiv</p...|$|E

40|$|France {{played a}} leading role in the European Enlightenment, {{influencing}} other European countries in their thinking and development of philosophical ideas based on the emerging ideals of liberté, égalité and fraternité. Among the many topics alive in intellectual circles at the time, a debate about the education of females peaked in the 18 th century, and it is not surprising that it was a Frenchman, François Fénelon, who drew attention first through his Traité de l'éducation des filles (1687) to the lack of education for females. His countrywoman Madame de Lambert extended his argument in her Avis d’une mère à sa fille (1688 - 1692, published 1728), a lengthy essay addressed to her daughter justifying the importance and describing the nature of female education. A half century later in Germany, Sophie von La Roche published her Briefe an Lina: Ein Buch für junge Frauenzimmer[,] die ihr Herz und ihren Verstand bilden wollen in her weekly paper Pomona für Teutschlands Töchter (1783 / 84). In these letters, collected and published in book form in 1807, she described the principles of a program of education for women which would lead to a happy life. Both of these female writers were exceptions in their time and fought to establish the position of women as educated and valued members of society. This thesis contextualizes and examines their writings to answer the question to what degree they contributed to a progressive step in the education of women at the time and the cultivation of educated and critical thinking in the next <b>female</b> <b>generation.</b> Hippolyte Taine’s sociological method assumes that literature can be analyzed through its author’s life on the basis of the three key concepts, race, milieu, and moment. After applying these concepts to the life of Madame de Lambert and Sophie von La Roche through historical background and sociological analysis, a close textual examination of the two central texts proceeds with these points of emphasis in each woman’s case: biographical background and social role determination (Frauenbild und Bestimmung der Frau); accommodation to the notion of ‘pleasing’ society, the males especially, and instilling happiness in others and themselves (Gefallen und Glück); and the education and erudition of women (Bildung und Gelehrsamkeit). Their contributions to these areas of active life and intellectual debate illustrate to some extent a personal adaptation to the conventions and standards of the era, but more importantly, beyond that, a breakout from traditional ideas and practices. In sum, Madame de Lambert is seen as a pioneer in the philosophical evaluation of the intellectual strength of women, and Sophie von La Roche, as a German counterpart with an emphasis on their practical enlightened education. The comparative analysis also reveals important sociological differences between Germany and France in the 18 th century with regard to the subject of female education...|$|E
40|$|PhD (Marketing Management) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2015 While {{there have}} been {{numerous}} studies directed at addressing the <b>female</b> <b>Generation</b> Y cohort’s fashion consumption patterns, there is a dearth of published research focused on male consumer fashion conscious behaviour, especially not that of the African Generation Y (hereafter referred to as black Generation Y) males. There are global indications that contemporary males are engaging in fashion apparel shopping more frequently than ever before. Moreover, unlike past generations, today’s male consumers have become increasingly fashion aware and fashion conscious, taking care of their looks and developing their own fashion style. Born between 1986 and 2005, in 2013, black Generation Y individuals made up approximately 83 percent of South Africa’s total Generation Y cohort and 38 percent of the country’s 52 981 991 population. In 2013, black Generation Y males accounted for an estimated 42 percent of the South African population. As a consequence of its size, the black Generation Y male market segment represents a potentially lucrative and attractive market for apparel retailers and fashion marketers. Marketers are particularly interested in those individuals pursuing tertiary qualifications given that a higher education ultimately acts as a predictor of their higher future spending potential and an indication of their social standing and influence within a society. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the causal relationships between black Generation Y male students’ need for uniqueness, fashion awareness, fashion consciousness and fashion conscious behaviour in order to model the determinants of black Generation Y male students fashion conscious behaviour. A self-administered questionnaire was administered on a single cross-sectional sample of 400 black Generation Y male students at three university campuses in the Gauteng province in 2013 – one from a comprehensive university, one from a university of technology and one from a traditional university. From the administered questionnaires, 213 were completed and returned as usable. The collected data was analysed by means of exploratory factor analysis, reliability and validity analysis, descriptive statistics and correlation analysis. In addition, structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied to test a proposed model derived from the literature. According to the results of the SEM analysis, black Generation Y males’ fashion awareness has a significant positive influence on their fashion consciousness, and their fashion consciousness has a significant positive influence on their fashion conscious behaviour. In terms of the dimensions of the need for uniqueness, unpopular choice has a significant positive influence on black Generation Y male students’ fashion awareness, whilst creative choice has a significant positive influence on their fashion consciousness, and avoidance of similarity has a direct significant positive influence on their fashion conscious behaviour. Furthermore, the findings suggest that their fashion consciousness is reliant on their fashion awareness, which in turn influences their fashion conscious behaviour. Findings from this study will aid marketers’ in better understanding black Generation Y male students’ fashion conscious behaviour. Furthermore, the recommendations provided suggest marketing strategy guidelines tailored at effectively targeting this market segment. Doctora...|$|E

Jessica Kiang of Indiewire gave the film a [...] "C" [...] rating, calling it [...] "a strangely old-fashioned film, yielding a big enough crop of corn to revive the entire Midwestern economy, putting forth a dubiously romanticized view of the philosophical beauty of the train-hopping lifestyle". Lee Marshall of Screen International in his favorable review commented that it is [...] "a women's film in which the sensitively-conveyed bond between three <b>female</b> <b>generations</b> of one family seem destined to be much stronger than any ties with the men who drift {{in and out of}} sight".|$|R
40|$|International audienceLabor {{migration}} {{has become}} common for adolescents in many African populations, {{where it is}} a key event in the transition into adulthood for both genders. This article examines the experiences of, expectations of, and perceptions about adolescent migration from different perspectives, taking into account their gender and generation. It is based on qualitative data, collected from a rural population in Mali, where labor migration is experienced by most adolescents (70 – 90 percent). Despite a convergence of migratory practices between genders, the subjective experience and the social construction around youth migration {{appear to be in}} contrast for girls and boys. Male migration is part of family economics, and adolescent boys use migration to strengthen their family status. Female migration is a personal project and includes strong expectations about learning and obtaining life skills. Social judgment of female migration is negative, but new lines of solidarity are emerging between <b>female</b> <b>generations...</b>|$|R
40|$|The genus Abispa {{includes}} Australia's largest wasps, potters with distinctive mud nests {{weighing up}} to 0. 5 [*]kg. During 31 days near Katherine, NT, Australia, we observed 8 active A. ephippium (Fabricius) nests and dissected 16. Nesting is lengthy and asynchronous; <b>female</b> <b>generations</b> often overlap. <b>Females</b> display long-term parental care through truncated progressive provisioning, removing debris, repairing damage, and attacking potential invaders. Males patrol water-gathering spots, and visit and associate with active nests, mating {{there and in}} flight. Females actively guard nests, but challenged nest-attending males simply retreat. The distinctive funnel-shaped entrance helps females defend nests physically but probably not chemically; dismantled for cell closure material, it is built anew for each cell. Nests contain up to 8 cells; construction and provisioning total about 7 days per cell. The only parasite was Stilbum cyanurum Forster. Thievery and nest usurpation by Pseudabispa paragioides (Meade-Waldo) were discovered...|$|R
