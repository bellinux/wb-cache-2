50|$|Less {{common is}} the Chalfant movement. In this movement, the boards remain {{stationary}} while the players move according to <b>guide</b> <b>cards.</b> This requires significantly more physical tables, because several tables {{are not in}} play on any given round. (Like the Howell movement, this movement is typically used {{when there is a}} relatively small number of players, typically no more than 12 pairs. Also like the Howell movement, this movement produces a single winner and pairs face all or almost all of the other pairs in play.) This movement has the advantage that pairs are often moving to a table that was not in use on a previous round, so a slow pair does not delay as many other pairs as in a Howell. Also, for several sizes, this movement is technically superior in that more pairs face all other pairs than in the corresponding Howell movement. This movement has the disadvantage of requiring a larger number of physical tables, and thus more space. It also requires the players to carry <b>guide</b> <b>cards</b> with them and consult them, while the <b>guide</b> <b>cards</b> usually remain on the tables for Howell movements.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{nuclear power}} plants (PWR), the rod cluster control {{assemblies}} (RCCAs) can be damaged by impact-sliding wear due to flow-induced vibrations which generate contacts with their guidance devices (RCC guide tube) inside the reactor pressure vessel. Two localized impact/sliding wear tests have been performed at conditions close to the PWR primary system on stainless steel claddings (316 L) using wear autoclave simulators operating without water flow. The influence of the excitation frequency and type of motion signal on the wear process and damage has been studied (other experimental conditions have been fixed for the tests). Some extensive non-destructive examinations have been performed on the worn specimens (rod and <b>guide</b> <b>card),</b> using weighing, scanning electron microscopy, EDX and 2 D profilometry. The analyses of the wear scars show that a small frequency associated with a latency time between two-rod movements lead to a wear damage more severe than those generated at higher frequency even if the cumulative sliding distance is 300 times lower. Moreover, the linear weight loss (per slid kilometer) of the slow test specimen (? 5500 ?g/km) {{is much higher than}} the fast test one (? 2 ?g/km). So our observations brought us {{to the conclusion that the}} wear mechanism related to the small frequency damage is a chemical dissolution (corrosion) of the austenitic steel associated with a mechanical depassivation of the oxidized surface layers. This first stage is followed by an oxides compaction or detachment stage due to the impact at the end on each motion. The guide cards are less damaged than the rods but both exhibit a typical cup-shaped pattern with many ellipsoidal-like marks (also called dimples or scallop/hammering marks) aligned in the direction of the tube motion. © 2005 Elsevier B.

40|$|AbstractBackground {{and purpose}} : The master patient’s index (MPI) card {{is the key}} to locate the patient’s record in medical records department. Use of MPI in {{hospital}} information systems is important. An accurate MPI is noted in evaluation and accreditation program. Our study was done on MPI at medical records depatment of teaching hospitals in Mazandaran medical university in respect of using indexing rules and arrangement of cards for filing. Materials and methods : This survey was done on patient’s cards in 5 teaching hospitals of Mazandaran medical university and 1999 MPI cards were checked. A part of data related to using indexing rules and filing was gathered with checklist and factors associated with management of department collected in questionnaire. Data processed with SPSS software and analyzed with descriptive and inference statistics. Results : Findings showed that 20 % of staff responsible for indexing and filing of MPI were technician (post diploma course) in medical records. In 100 % of hospitals, <b>guide</b> <b>card</b> and cross-index card wasn’t use. Indexing error increased with the increasing the number of admitted patients (p= 0. 003), low experience (p= 0. 001) and degree and no course study relation of medical records department managers (X 2 = 9. / 03, p = 0. 000). In addition, indexing error increased in staff with no academic training (X 2 = 3. 84, p = 0. 05). Also results showed that there is 64. 2 % indexing error and 9 % of cards are misfiled. Conclusion: According to the findings, staffing professional personnel, training them with up dated knowledge, periodic control of issued cards, creating needed rules and regulation based on new scientific materials, exact indexing and filling rules suggested...|$|E

40|$|A {{survey of}} North American medical school {{libraries}} {{was made to}} determine current trends in subject cataloging practices. First, responses from 114 of these libraries are recorded and analyzed in the following areas: subject heading authority lists employed; use of the divided versus the dictionary catalog; and the form in which local subject authority files are kept. Then, focusing on 78 libraries that use MeSH in combination with a divided catalog, a further analysis of responses is made concerning issues relating to subject cataloging practices: updating the subject catalog to conform to annual MeSH changes; use of <b>guide</b> <b>cards</b> in the catalog; use of MeSH subheadings; filing conventions; and related issues.

40|$|Existing risk {{simulations}} {{make the}} assumption that when a free tin whisker has bridged two adjacent exposed electrical conductors, {{the result is an}} electrical short circuit. This conservative assumption is made because shorting is a random event that has a currently unknown probability associated with it. Due to contact resistance electrical shorts may not occur at lower voltage levels. In this experiment, we study the effect of varying voltage on the breakdown of the contact resistance which leads to a short circuit. From this data we can estimate the probability of an electrical short, as a function of voltage, given that a free tin whisker has bridged two adjacent exposed electrical conductors. Also, three tin whiskers grown from the same Space Shuttle Orbiter <b>card</b> <b>guide</b> used in the aforementioned experiment were cross-sectioned and studied using a focused ion beam (FIB). The rare polycrystalline structure seen in the FIB cross section was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

5000|$|The Howell {{movement}} is sometimes used instead, usually {{when there are}} {{a relatively small number}} of tables. This {{movement is}} more complicated and varies according to the total number of pairs. All boards and most pairs move after every round according to <b>guide</b> <b>cards</b> placed on the tables, or carried by the players (usually one pair, or sometimes more, remain stationary). The Howell is sometimes considered a fairer test than the Mitchell, because each pair faces all or nearly all of the other pairs, not just the pairs sitting in the opposite direction. However the fairness of a movement depends not only on who one plays against but also to a considerable extent on one's indirect opponents, i.e. those who play the same cards as you do. The Howell also tends to be more error-prone than the Mitchell due to its greater complexity. Ideally the number of rounds will be one less than the number of pairs competing, so that each pair plays one round against ever other pair. Each round will usually consist of either 2, 3, or 4 boards. However, sometimes this produces an inconvenient total number of boards to be played. To avoid this, a [...] "reduced Howell" [...] or [...] "three-quarter Howell" [...] movement is often played, with fewer rounds and usually with more than one stationary pair, so that the number of rounds plus the number of stationary pairs equals the total number of pairs.|$|R
