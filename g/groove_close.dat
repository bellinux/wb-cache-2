50|$|After {{gastrulation}} the notochord - a flexible, rod-shaped {{body that}} {{runs along the}} back of the embryo - has been formed from the mesoderm. During the third week of gestation the notochord sends signals to the overlying ectoderm, inducing it to become neuroectoderm. This results in a strip of neuronal stem cells that runs {{along the back of}} the embryo. This strip is called the neural plate, and is the origin of the entire nervous system. The neural plate folds outwards to form the neural groove. Beginning in the future neck region, the neural folds of this <b>groove</b> <b>close</b> to create the neural tube (this form of neurulation is called primary neurulation). The ventral (front) part of the neural tube is called the basal plate; the dorsal (rear) part is called the alar plate. The hollow interior is called the neural canal.

40|$|Exchanges in {{positions}} 1 and 2 of the putative recognition helix allow lac repressor to bind to ideal lac operator variants in which base pair 4 has been replaced. We show here that an Arg- 22 [...] Asn exchange in position 6 of the putative recognition helix of lac repressor abolishes lac repressor binding to ideal lac operator. This lac repressor variant, however, binds to {{a variant of}} the ideal lac operator 5 ' TTTGAGCGCTCAAA 3 ' in which the original G. C of position 6 has been replaced by T. A.

40|$|Thin-walled tubular joints, bonded end to end, are {{commonly}} used specimens to measure the mechanical properties of thin adhesive layers subjected to uniform shear stress distributions. Unfortunately, the application of an axial loading to this geometry leads to strong stress concentrations {{at the edges of}} the adherend–adhesive interface. This drawback undermines the use of this test for characterizing adhesives under biaxial stress conditions. With the aim of removing these stress concentrations, this paper suggests the introduction of stress relieving grooves on the internal and external surfaces of the tubular adherends. The optimal shape of the groove is identified following the Taguchi robust optimization technique. Via finite element analyses, the stress concentrations {{at the edges of the}} adherend–adhesive interface are calculated. Many geometries are examined for different adherend and adhesive properties (noise factors) in order to identify the groove shape that minimizes the stress concentrations for all experimental conditions. The analysis shows that a shallow V-shaped <b>groove</b> <b>close</b> to the adherend–adhesive interface smoothes significantly the stress peaks due to axial loading. With this simple modification, a tubular butt joint becomes a universal specimen for applying any combinations of reasonably uniform shear and normal stresses to thin adhesive layers...|$|E

During surgical exploration, both ossified masses were found in deltopectoral region and mostly in fibers of clavicular and acromial parts of deltoid muscle. Pathological reports confirmed the structure of masses as mature trabecular bone.

40|$|The sagitta of Kurtus gulliveri was ovate, {{moderately}} {{thick with}} the following attributes: lateral surface convex, mesial surface flat; dorsal margin sinuate, posterior margin rounded ventrally, ventral margin rounded and irregular; sulcus divided into ostium and cauda by constriction of dorsal and ventral margins, heterosulcoid, colliculum heteromorph; dorsal depression large and distinct, ventral <b>groove</b> <b>close</b> to margin in larger otoliths; rostrum broad and antirostrum small, separated by wide, shallow excisural notch. Otolith size was moderate, average 46 % standard length (LS), typical for a perciform. Annuli on 78 whole sagittae were read, and 15 % of these were transversely sectioned for verification of the annuli. Males ranged from 94 to 235 mm LS and females from 95 to 284 mm LS. There was little difference in size distribution of the sample between the sexes, perhaps due to a 6 month spawning season over which young were continually added to the population. Some sexual dimorphism was noted, however, as age 2 year females were significantly larger than males of the same age. The largest fish aged was a 284 mm LS, 3 year-old female, and the oldest age reached was 4 years by two males. It appears likely that most spawning females are 2 years old, but some larger 1 year old fish may attain sexual maturity. # 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles Key words: age and growth; Kurtus gulliveri; nurseryfish; otolith; sagitta...|$|E

40|$|The {{solution}} {{structure of}} the dodecamer duplex d(CTTTTGCAAAAG) 2 and its 2 : 1 complex with the bis-benzimidazole Hoechst 33258 has been investigated by NMR and NOE-restrained molecular dynamics (rMD) simulations. Drug molecules are bound {{in each of the}} two A-tracts with the bulky N-methylpiperazine ring of each drug located close to the central TG (CA) step, binding essentially to the narrow minor groove of each A-tract. MD simulations over 1 ns, using an explicit solvation model, reveal time-averaged sequence-dependent narrowing of the minor groove from the 3 ′-end towards the 5 ′-end of each TTTT sequence. Distinct junctions at the TpG (CpA) steps, characterised by large positive roll, low helical and propeller twists and rapid AT base pair opening rates, add to the widening of the groove at these sites and appear to account for the bound orientation of the two drug molecules with the N-methylpiperazine ring binding in the wider part of the <b>groove</b> <b>close</b> to the junctions. Comparisons between the free DNA structure and the 2 : 1 complex (heavy atom RMSD 1. 55 Å) reveal that these sequence-dependent features persist in both structures. NMR studies of the sequence d(GAAAAGCTTTTC) 2, in which the A-tracts have been inverted with the elimination of the TpG junctions, results in loss of orientational specificity of Hoechst 33258 and formation of multiple bound species in solution, consistent with the drug binding {{in a number of different}} orientations...|$|E

30|$|Groove filling was {{the first}} method {{proposed}} in the literature to produce a composite by FSP (Mishra et al. 2003). It is simple and requires less machining. A straight groove can be produced on the workpiece using ordinary milling cutter. Recently, Gandra et al.

Another strategy was proposed by Heydarian et al. (2014) in groove filling method in which parallel grooves with gradient groove depths were produced and FSP was carried out.
