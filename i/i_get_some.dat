500|$|In 1829, Irving {{moved into}} Granada's ancient palace Alhambra, [...] "determined to linger here", he said, [...] "until <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> {{writings}} under way {{connected with the}} place". Before he could get any significant writing underway, however, he was notified of his appointment as Secretary to the American Legation in London. Worried he would disappoint friends and family if he refused the position, Irving left Spain for England in July 1829.|$|E

She always arrives at fashion shows well before their {{scheduled}} start. [...] "I use the waiting time to make phone calls and notes; <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> of my best ideas at the shows," [...] she says. According to the BBC documentary series Boss Woman, she rarely stays at parties for more than 20minutes {{at a time and}} goes to bed by 10:15 every night. She exerts a great deal of control over the magazine's visual content. Since her first days as editor, she has required that photographers not begin until she has approved Polaroids of the setup and clothing. Afterwards, they must submit all their work to the magazine, not just their personal choices.|$|E

2500|$|The {{two main}} {{characters}} appear {{exclusively in the}} first episode, {{and most of the}} later episodes. [...] The cartoon is minimalistic in style: it is presented on a plain magenta background, and the characters are white with dark grey outlines. Most of the episodes – usually the more recent cartoons – begin with Weebl singing a short song, usually about pie, his main love in life (an example of this [...] "This is a song/a song about pie/hope <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> before I die..."). Bob moves on and off by rolling and remains typically {{to the right of the}} animation pane.|$|E

60|$|The weather here {{is greatly}} improved, and I hope {{in three days}} {{to be in the}} chalet. That is, if <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> money to float me there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then, I {{will go with}} you. <b>I</b> must <b>get</b> <b>some</b> grease or {{something}} to put {{on my face and}} hands; they are smarting awfully." ...|$|R
60|$|So I {{took the}} hint, and came too. I was too excited to sleep, but this diary has quieted me, and I feel <b>I</b> shall <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sleep tonight.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, miss, I wish he did {{not know}} me by sight; but I expect that <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sort of a {{disguise}} so that he won't recognize me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Story be damned!' {{said the}} Time Traveller. 'I want {{something}} to eat. I won't say a word until <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> peptone into my arteries. Thanks. And the salt.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My {{shoes are}} caked with chalk,' {{she said as}} they walked {{downwards}} again; and she drew back her dress to look at them. 'How can <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> of it cleared off?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit there now, Billie, till <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> brush, an' make {{yourself}} useful by cutting out goose heads. See, {{here are some}} branches o' the right sort ready to hand. No doubt some Redskins have been at work here before us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't afford {{anything}} more," [...] {{she told}} Cynthia Ann, [...] "but {{they must have}} something to stay their little stomachs. And <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> <b>some</b> water at a farmhouse." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Come, come, most illustrious," [...] said Pica good-humouredly, [...] "I'm {{not going}} to {{encourage}} you to set up for nerves. You are much better without them, and <b>I</b> must <b>get</b> <b>some</b> medusae." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} something of that, Roger, and if I can't {{get on the}} track any other way, I'll go there," [...] was the reply. [...] "But I hate to think of leaving here until <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> kind of word from Crumville." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what I will do, Harry. I {{will not}} lose a moment's time, but will set {{about it at}} once; if I spend ten {{thousand}} pounds in advertising I will find him. As to Fred, I cannot meet him again until I {{get to the bottom}} of the affair, so we will stay away from England till <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> news of Frank." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How have I been?" [...] the {{corporal}} answered gruffly. [...] "Why, I {{have been}} drunk {{for the most}} part. When I draw my money I lay it out in liquor, {{and as long as}} that lasts <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> peace in life. When I'm cleaned out I go upon tramp, partly in the hope of picking up the price of a dram, and partly in order to look for you." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{linen and}} {{glassware}} and silver of the Caravanserai were almost as coarse {{as those of}} a temperance hotel, for all the raftered ceiling and the etchings in the dining-room. Hunting up the stewardess of the inn, a bustling {{young woman who was}} reading Keats energetically at an office-like desk, Mr. Wrenn begged: [...] "I wonder could <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> special cups and plates and stuff for high tea tonight. I got a kind of party--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! my lively young Archer?" [...] {{said the}} worthy Syndic. [...] "Nay, {{if it has}} been my fate to find a friend in this fearful night, I will not quit him, I promise you. Go where you will, I follow, and could <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> of the tight lads of our guildry together, I {{might be able to help}} you in turn, but they are all squandered abroad like so many pease.--Oh, it is a fearful night!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> of it done," [...] {{said the}} Pupil; [...] "but {{there have been}} times when I have {{wondered}} whether it wouldn't have been better for me to have been something else. But I have chosen my profession, and I suppose I must be faithful to it. We will start immediately on our search; but first I must put the cave in order, for the old man will be sure to come up while I am gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, Fred. I am {{not afraid}} of that crowd, and the more they talk the better I'll like it, for then <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sort of line on what they are aiming at." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What can <b>I</b> <b>get</b> for mother? She {{never will}} own {{that she needs}} anything, and goes shabby so I can be nice. <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> <b>some</b> of those fine, thick stockings, hers are all darns,--but they might not fit. Flannel is useful, but it isn't a pretty present. What does she need most?" ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{the husbands}} came they {{joined in the}} expose. [...] "My name is Elizabeth. I'm the celebrated musical tailor. The skirts fall for me by the thou. Do <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> more veal loaf?" [...] merrily shrieked Dave Dyer. He had some admirable stories about the tricks the town youngsters had played on Valborg. They had dropped a {{decaying}} perch into his pocket. They had pinned on his back a sign, [...] "I'm the prize boob, kick me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I did {{not come}} to make you sad, Aunt Kitty,' he replied, smiling; 'no; <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> energy back when I {{remember}} that this may be a probation. Her mother would not have thought me man enough, and that is what I have to work for. Whether this end well or not, she is the leading star of my life.' And, with the renewal of spirit with which he had spoken, he pressed his aunt's hand, and ran down stairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "I dont know. I hope he {{is quite}} well," [...] said Marian, her voice {{trembling}} a little. [...] "Mrs. Crawford: {{you are the only}} friend I have in America; and you have been so very kind to me that since I must trouble some one, I have ventured to come to you. The truth is that I have left my husband; and I have only about one hundred dollars in the world. I must live on that until <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> employment, or perhaps some money of my own from England." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There! I am up now; but at your peril you fetch {{a candle}} yet: wait two minutes till <b>I</b> <b>get</b> into <b>some</b> dry garments, if any dry there be--yes, {{here is my}} dressing-gown. Now run!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you feel}} better?" [...] he went on. [...] "If so, and {{you wish to}} give me some of your supper, please do. If not, it is of no importance. <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> <b>some</b> elsewhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! I did,' said Lord Eskdale, thoughtfully. 'But I want a {{great many}} things,' {{continued}} Tancred. 'I must make arrangements about money; I suppose <b>I</b> must <b>get</b> <b>some</b> letters; in fact, I want generally your advice.' ...|$|R
