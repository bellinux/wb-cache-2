25|$|The {{majority}} opinion, however, of most Islamic scholar {{is that a}} niqab wearer (niqabi), {{in exchange}} for being permitted to wear the niqab and it not being made prohibited, is required only to refrain from criticizing other Muslim women who don't wear the niqab if the other Muslim women cover all their body except for their face (i.e. hijabis). The niqabi is also required to refrain from forcing or propagating her niqab wearing practice upon others, especially against their will. Then, a niqabi shall also not be criticized for her wearing the niqab because {{she thought it was}} obligatory, or because she had been taught it was obligatory, or because she wishes to <b>err</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of caution in an incorrect but good faith gesture of extreme modesty.|$|E

Despite these flaws, Jackson said he would tune in next week because he would [...] "rather have a show <b>err</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of unbelievable than unremarkable, and I'm interested to see if Abrams has any more tricks up his sleeve". Erin Fox of TV Guide also liked [...] "The Same Old Story" [...] better than the pilot because she thought that it [...] "had really cool special effects, awesome Walter-isms, and actual chemistry forming between Olivia and Peter", and [...] "we also got to delve more into the connections between Walter, Nina Sharp, Massive Dynamic and the government and the experiments they conducted before Walter was institutionalized".|$|E
500|$|Clarke had to {{deal with}} four natural {{disasters}} during his tenure. An outbreak of smallpox in 1894 was the result of labour migration and men returning from working in Witwatersrand. When it proved too costly for the people, he waived the charge for the vaccination. Locust swarms in 1894 and 1895 caused damage to crops and resulted in famine in 1896. The government response was to offer the chief of each tribe a reward of 3d for every muid of locusts collected as well as cattle to slaughter when a swarm was eradicated. At the same time, Clarke bought 1,090 muids of quick-growing mealies to be given on payment to families requiring immediate relief, a measure of which Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, Governor of Natal, approved: [...] "It is better to <b>err</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of unnecessary expenditure than to run the risk of exposing the people to starvation." [...] Finally, in 1897, an outbreak of rinderpest killed many cattle and the government responded with a programme of inoculation.|$|E

500|$|Nielsen {{ratings for}} Homicide: Life on the Street had {{gradually}} declined throughout the , leaving {{the show at}} high risk of cancellation by the time the season concluded.

After a nine-episode , the network approved four more episodes for the show's [...] as a trial run to determine whether to continue or cancel the show. The script for [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was completed before the first season ended, but NBC executives asked for several refinements [...] including less involved plots and fewer camera movements [...] before approving a second season. In an attempt to appease the network and improve ratings, executive producers Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana sought to make subtle changes to give the show a stronger mainstream appeal, while aiming not to compromise its integrity or originality. With [...] "Bop Gun", the producers slightly toned down the bleak visual style and hand-held photography motif. It is also the first episode {{to focus on a}} single story, rather than multiple subplots, which Fontana felt allowed the writers to tell the main story better. Fontana said of the changes to the series, [...] "We were experimenting with our first nine episodes. Whenever you try something new, you tend to <b>err</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of breaking ground.

[...] "Bop Gun" [...] marked the first episode with Jean de Segonzac as director of photography. The first scene, which depicts the moments immediately before the shooting, juxtaposes shots of the Ellison family admiring the tourist attractions of Baltimore with shots of their shooters playing basketball before following the family. The photography depicts the different sides of Baltimore by presenting the Ellison family shots like a cheerful tourist advertisement, with the other shots presenting a grittier image of the city.|$|E

2500|$|Pascal Boyer's Religion Explained (2002), {{based in}} part on his anthropological field work, treats belief in God {{as the result of the}} brain's {{tendency}} towards agency detection. Boyer suggests that, because of evolutionary pressures, humans <b>err</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of attributing agency where there isn't any. In Boyer's view, belief in supernatural entities spreads and becomes culturally fixed because of their memorability. The concept of [...] "minimally counterintuitive" [...] beings that differ from the ordinary in a small number of ways (such as being invisible, able to fly, or having access to strategic and otherwise secret information) leave a lasting impression that spreads through word-of-mouth.|$|E
