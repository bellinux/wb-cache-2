During the next decade, other compulsory wage-related pension plans were enacted into law for temporary employees, for national and local government employees, for those working for a state church, and for the self-employed. At the end of the decade, a supplementary plan was created for farmers as well. Seamen had had an incomebased plan since 1956, and, as of 1986, those active in freelance professions such as acting and writing also obtained coverage. These <b>employment</b> <b>pension</b> plans were completely funded by the employers, private or public, who paid contributions, equal on the average to about 10 percent of a worker's earnings, into funds managed by seven large insurance companies or who set up funds on their own. Self-employed persons had to choose a fund. The Central Pension Security Institute was responsible for keeping records about employment and benefits.|$|E

5000|$|Many of the Redford government's {{decisions}} were quickly reversed by Premier Jim Prentice once he assumed office. When the 2014 fall legislative session was prorogued, two controversial bills {{died on the}} order paper (the Public Sector Pension Plans Amendment Act (Bill 9) and the <b>Employment</b> <b>Pension</b> (Private Sector) Plans Amendment Act (Bill 10)). The move satisfied the AUPE who had objected to these bills, in concert with Bills 45 and 46, as an attack on public sector workers by the Redford government. The promise was also made not to re-introduce Bills 9 and 10. The following day, {{it was announced that}} Prentice would visit Michener Centre, a long term care center controversially marked for closure by the Redford government. Opposition parties had called on successive governments to keep the centre open. Many of Prentice's first actions in office were seen as a direct repudiation of Redford's mandate and an attempt to rehabilitate the Progressive Conservative Party {{in the eyes of the}} public.

[...] This bill was followed by the Business Corporations Amendment Act (No. 2), which provided protection for minority shareholders in the event that a corporation was converted to unlimited liability over opposition, and which clarified the period during which former shareholders in unlimited liability corporations remained liable. [...] It passed with Liberal support, although Pannu expressed concern that the new protections were not sufficient.

40|$|Many {{statutory}} solvency requirements, e. g. {{the system}} prescribed by the EU, {{do not take}} into account the distribution of the investments. In practice, however, an adequate solvency margin of an insurance company depends strongly on the investment portfo-lio. This paper describes how the sufficient level of the solvency margin can be esti-mated. In this, only the margin depending on the company’s investments is dealt with and the margin for the insurance risk is not included. First, the paper describes the use of an asset liability simulation model for the calcula-tion for the solvency margin. Then some formulas are developed for approximating the simulation results. These formulas depend on the means, standard deviations and cor-relation coefficients of the investment yields, as well as on the chosen risk level. In addition, the interest rate applied to the reserves is taken into account. Finally, the paper describes the new formula for the statutory solvency requirements of the Finnish <b>employment</b> <b>pension</b> institutions...|$|E

40|$|The {{commonly}} held {{belief that the}} Central government pension bill {{has the potential to}} reach an unsustainable level {{does not appear to be}} based on any realistic assessment of such liabilities in the future years. The future pension liabilities of the Central Government would be primarily driven by the structure and behaviour of employment in the Central Government in the past and the structure of prevailing pension system. This paper applies theoretically established models to the available time series on employment to estimate the growth in number of pensioners and make realistic projection of the future pension liabilities of the Central Government comprising five accounting departments such as Railways, Defence, Posts, Telecommunication and Civil. On the basis of these estimates it is concluded that if the present pension system prevails, the future pension liability of the Central Government would be reasonably sustainable.

40|$|Launched on 28  January 2010, A Stronger, Fairer Australia {{sets out}} the Australian Government’s vision and {{strategy}} for social inclusion, now {{and into the}} future. Social Inclusion means ensuring no Australian is left behind by giving all the opportunities, resources, capabilities and responsibilities to learn, work, connect with others and {{have a say in}} community life. The statement sets out a new approach to break down the barriers that stand between the most disadvantaged Australians and participation. Despite a strong economy in recent years, disadvantage still prevents many Australians from getting a fair go. The Government is determined to address this disadvantage, which costs the entire nation in lower productivity, chronic health problems, welfare dependence and fractured communities. The Rudd Government’s social inclusion strategy will form partnerships between the people in government, the not-for-profit sector and businesses that have the greatest experience in addressing disadvantage. The strategy builds on the many reforms and investments the Government has made over the past two years, including those in fairer workplace relations, <b>employment,</b> <b>pension</b> reform, housing and homelessness, early childhood education and schools. It also builds on the existing strengths of individuals, families and communities. image: report - A stronger, fairer Australi...|$|E
40|$|In the Finnish {{statutory}} <b>employment</b> <b>pension</b> scheme all {{the pension}} institutions {{have a common}} technical interest rate for the pension reserves. This interest rate is determined for each year, and {{it may also be}} changed during the year. In all cases, the interest rate is decided in advance before the period in which it is applied and before the actual investment results are known for certain. The law prescribes that both the security of the pensions and the obtainable investment yield {{must be taken into account}} when the technical interest rate is determined. This paper describes the method that was developed by the Interest Rate Working Group in the year 1998. The maximum obtainable investment yield is estimated using the Markowitz efficient frontier model, which gives the optimal mean values of the investment yield associated with different standard deviations. The standard deviations are then connected with the level of the solvency margin by specifying the risk of fal-ling to a statutory solvency limit. The result is the expected value of the obtainable investment yield as a function of the level of the solvency margin. The interest rate is then calculated by including terms that take into account the growth rate of the reserves and the short term level of the yields. The method does not produce the technical interest rate directly but rather gives a basis to assist in determining the proper level of the interest rate. 395...|$|E

40|$|The {{economic}} orthodoxy of ‘light-touch’ regulation {{has been}} widely discredited by recent events in the financial markets, and shareholder-oriented management has come under intense scrutiny. As a result this collection of papers aims to consider the merits of stakeholder-oriented economies. In this volume, 35 scholars examine case studies and scenarios {{in a number of}} countries, ranging from economic powers such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany to post-socialist states such as Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria and emerging countries such as Brazil, Russia, and India. Further studies deal with developments in Singapore and Nigeria, as well as in South Africa and other countries. With contributions from leading experts from all around the world in the fields of labour law, industrial relations, labour economics, labour statistics, human resources management, organization theory and other related subjects, the book focuses on the impact of the global economic crisis and its implications for the future of employment. Specific matters covered include: adversarial versus strategic collective bargaining; transnational collective bargaining; long-term employees as corporate stakeholders; workers’ voice and participation in the restructuring of undertakings; privatization of state-owned companies; executive pay; investment in vocational training in times of economic crisis; the impact of the EU’s Cross-Border Merger Directive; inherent dangers in the EMU one-size-fits-all monetary policy; and large-scale corporate fraud. With theoretical arguments and empirical data, this volume aims to contribute to the debate over whether shareholder or stakeholder approaches to management yield the best results in terms of employment outcomes. As the recession continues to take its toll on <b>employment,</b> <b>pension</b> funds, public services, and living standards, the book will be of interest to policymakers and legal scholars worldwide who are concerned with the future of employment relations and their effect on productivity and social stability...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Survey of Personal Incomes (SPI) is based on information held by HM Revenue and Customs tax offices on individuals who could be liable to UK income tax. It is carried out annually by HMRC and covers income assessable to tax for each tax year. Not {{all of them are}} taxpayers because the operation of personal reliefs and allowances may remove them from liability. Where income exceeds the threshold for operation of Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE), the survey provides the most comprehensive and accurate official source of data on personal incomes. The SPI is compiled to provide a quantified evidence base from which to cost proposed changes to tax rates, personal allowances and other tax reliefs for Treasury Ministers. It is used to inform policy decisions within HMRC and the Treasury, as well as for tax modelling and forecasting purposes. In addition, it is used to provide summary information for the National Accounts that are prepared by the Office for National Statistics. Finally, it is used to provide information to Members of Parliament, other Government Departments, companies, organisation and individuals. The UK Data Archive currently holds the Public Use Tape (PUT) data for 1985 - 86 and 1995 - 96 onwards (data for 2008 - 09 is currently unavailable). For further details of sampling and coverage criteria, see documentation. Further information about the SPI, including income tax and personal incomes statistics, is available on the gov. uk Statistics at HMRC webpages.

40|$|There {{are several}} {{indicators}} shaping {{the future of}} workforce and workforce of the future. These indicators include phenomena such as digitalization, globalization and ageing of population. Technological development brings advanced technologies including intelligent automation available, and many roles of people are being taken over by machines. Additionally, there are many new businesses evolving and societal steps taken forward as new global, digital solutions spread all over the world. All these global phenomena force Finnish companies and workforce to adapt themselves, and therefore new requirements for skills and capabilities are created. In Finland, the pension scheme lies heavily on well-functioning labour market and high <b>employment.</b> <b>Pension</b> companies role is to secure pension funds, to carry out statutory earnings-related pensions and to support employment. Therefore, pension companies operational environment and mission are highly affected by workforce transformation. In the theoretical part of the thesis the Finnish statutory earnings-related pension scheme is explained. Also the actors of the pension scheme are introduced {{and the role of}} pension companies in the earnings-related pension scheme is explained. The theoretical part forms a holistic picture of the characteristics of pension insurance business and of the offerings and processes of pension companies. Additionally, workforce transformation is explained component by component in the theoretical part of the thesis. The objective of the theoretical part is to form a proper understanding of the pension companies current operational environment and the indicators of workforce transformation. Effects of workforce transformation on pension companies roles, responsibilities and business development were researched by using the Delphi method. Based on the results, {{it can be said that}} of all the workforce transformation indicators, the technological indicators are going to have the greatest impact within the next ten years. Increasing demand and growing expectations of digital services are going to drive service development of pension companies together with services for increasing number of entrepreneurs and small companies. Pension companies role is going to remain remarkable and even increase in importance in the society. However, the role as working life developer was unclear as the experts had dissenting opinions about the subject. In total, most of the experts saw pension companies to have a lot of potential, that should be used in working life development and societal decision making...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{has hit the}} whole globe hard and Spain is no exception. The current unemployment rate of 25, 8 % is alarming high and it has broken earlier unemployment records. The situation of youth is the worst, as youth unemployment has already reached over 50 %. The crisis has eroded prospects of young people entering the labour market. The chances of Spanish university graduates might be better compared to those with no studies at all. However, their labour situation was not overwhelmingly good before the recession. In Spain, university graduates have, for the last twenty years, contended with precarious, temporary jobs {{for which they were}} over qualified. This Master’s Thesis concerns itself with effects of an {{economic crisis}} on the Spanish university graduates. Instead of economic facts, number and figures, it considers the human cost of the crisis by using qualitative methods. The data consists of six, semi-structured, in-depth interviews with Spanish university graduates and then was analysed by qualitative content analysis. To conceptualise the results of data analysis further, peace researcher Galtung’s theory of structural violence was used. The theory takes into consideration both the individual and social context. It also analyses the circumstances at which structural violence turns into direct violence. For example can mass youth unemployment turn into a violent conflict? Structural violence is present in lives of the interviewees as in general in the Spanish society. The inequality and injustice have increased during the economic crisis.   Due to the budget cuts and reforms, people have unequal access to society’s resources such as <b>employment,</b> <b>pension</b> schemes, education and health care. Educated young people are either unemployed or employed in jobs that do not correspond their educational level, and in precarious labour conditions. Structural violence causes frustration, fear and insecurity among the interviewees. They feel mistrust towards politicians and the political system in general. Frustration among the interviewees was overwhelming. Collective frustration caused by unemployment and low future prospects might have severe social, economic, and political consequences in the future. These consequences can be seen in regions such as North Africa and the Middle East, where unemployment rates among young people have reached 20 % during the past 20 years. Massive youth unemployment is a risk to social cohesion {{on the other side of}} Mediterranean. It should be questioned, whether the Spanish government and European Union do not have any other options to handle the economic crisis by impoverishing the younger generations? Losing a generation can have surprisingly high cost in the future. Keywords: economic crisis, university graduates, Spain, structural violenc...|$|E
