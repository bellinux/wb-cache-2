The classical iteration method involves time consuming three <b>iterative</b> <b>loops</b> for obtaining the optimal solution. This paper presents an analytical method for eliminating the two <b>iterative</b> <b>loops</b> of the classical iteration method with a view of enhancing the computational efficiency.

Applying AP to VANETs [10] remarkably improves cluster stability. Nevertheless, AP is a distance-based clustering algorithm, which results in the frequent changing of CHs when speed changes dramatically. Moreover, AP requires several <b>iterative</b> <b>loops</b> that increase the delay time of cluster formation.|$|R

It uses Cellular Automata principles to analyze the interaction between individual vehicles. The microsimulator produces individual locations of all travelers and vehicles at all times. The microsimulator and the router work in an <b>iterative</b> <b>loop</b> to equilibrate the assigned traffic in the network. The microsimulator follows those travel plans and determines {{a new set of}} link delays that are used to replace the ones previously used by the router. This process iterate until equilibrium is achieved.|$|E
5000|$|An off-by-one error (OBOE), also {{commonly}} known as an OBOB (off-by-one bug), OB1 error, or [...] "that extra inch you didn't really want", is a logic error involving the discrete equivalent of a boundary condition. It often occurs in computer programming when an <b>iterative</b> <b>loop</b> iterates one time too many or too few. This problem could arise when a programmer makes mistakes such as using [...] "is {{less than or equal}} to" [...] where [...] "is less than" [...] should have been used in a comparison, or fails to take into account that a sequence starts at zero rather than one (as with array indices in many languages). This can also occur in a mathematical context.|$|E
50|$|In {{languages}} (such as C and Java) {{that favor}} <b>iterative</b> <b>looping</b> constructs, {{there is usually}} significant time and space cost associated with recursive programs, due to the overhead required to manage the stack and the relative slowness of function calls; in functional languages, a function call (particularly a tail call) is typically a very fast operation, and the difference is usually less noticeable.|$|R

The receiver structures of bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID), iterative sourcechannel decoding (ISCD), and iterative source coded modulation (ISCM) are merged to one novel Turbo system, in which in two <b>iterative</b> <b>loops</b> reliability information is exchanged between the three single components, demodulator, channel decoder, and (softbit) source decoder. Simulations show quality improvements compared to the different previously known systems, which use iterative processing only for two components of the receiver...|$|R
50|$|During the Complex Off-design calculation, the {{operating}} {{point on the}} compressor map is constantly being guessed (in terms of '''''' and '''''') to obtain {{an estimate of the}} compressor mass flow, pressure ratio and efficiency. After the combustion calculation is completed, the implied compressor mechanical shaft speed is used to estimate the turbine corrected speed (i.e. ''''''). Typically, the turbine load (power demanded) and entry flow and temperature are used to estimate the turbine enthalpy drop/inlet temperature (i.e. ''''''). The estimated turbine corrected speed and enthalpy drop/inlet temperature parameters are used to obtain, from the turbine map, an estimate of the turbine corrected flow ('''''')and efficiency (i.e. ''''''). The calculation then continues, in the usual way, through the turbine, jetpipe and nozzle. If the constraints are not within tolerance, the iteration engine makes another guess at the iteration variables and the <b>iterative</b> <b>loop</b> is restarted.|$|E

In addition to avoiding term-size and case explosion as could happen for deep and complex pipelines during flushing and helping localize errors, our method can also handle stages with <b>iterative</b> <b>loops.</b> The technique is illustrated on pipelined- {{as well as a}} superscalar pipelined implementations of a subset of the DLX architecture...|$|R

The methods incorporate integrated system optimisation and parameter estimation which utilizes process measurements to achieve real process optimality inspite of model reality differences. The double <b>iterative</b> <b>loop</b> structures of the proposed algorithms use the real process measurement within the outer loops while the inner loops involve model based computation only. This means that the algorithms use available information from the real process efficiently and {{a significant reduction in}} set-point alterations to real subprocesses is achieved. In order to cater for process complexity the inner loops are organised in the form of two level hierarchical structures.

In this setup parameters are considered as random variables in a Bayesian sense, which requires integration over parameter distributions. This is accomplished by well suited quadratures. The suggested procedure is incorporated into a state space architec-ture, which allows for sequential calculation of likelihood functions. This is done by normal correlation updates and prediction error decomposition. The resulting EAP-Filter can process a variety of nonlinear problems, in-cluding latent states.

40|$|In [1 - 2], we {{proposed}} an iterative technique called Iterative Watermark Embedding (IWE) for watermark embedding in JPEG compressed domain. The proposed technique embeds the watermark successfully when the quality factor of the JPEG image is high, {{but when the}} quality factor is low, not all the bits of the watermark can be embedded. This is due to uneven distribution of capacities in {{different regions of the}} image. Moreover, the computation complexity of the <b>iterative</b> <b>loop</b> is high. In this paper we improve the technique using shuffling to equalize the capacities of different regions and the <b>iterative</b> <b>loop</b> is replaced by a direct approach to reduce the computational complexity. We call this direct approach as Direct JPEG Watermarking Embedding (DJWE). Human Visual System (HVS) model is used to prioritize the DCT coefficients to achieve good visual quality.

40|$|Abstract—This work {{describes}} an advanced physics-based com-pact MOSFET model (SP). Both the quasistatic and nonquasi-static versions of SP are surface-potential-based. The model is sym-metric, includes the accumulation region, small-geometry effects, {{and has a}} consistent current and charge formulation. The surface potential is computed analytically {{and there are no}} <b>iterative</b> <b>loops</b> anywhere in the model. Availability of the surface potential in the source-drain overlap regions enables a physics-based formulation of the extrinsic model (e. g., gate tunneling current) and allows for a noise model free of discontinuities or unphysical interpolation schemes.

40|$|Abstract: An {{enhanced}} FFT based parametric algorithm for {{an instant}} harmonic analysis of electrical power systems is presented. It is iterative and insensitive to the correct identification {{of the order of}} the distorted signal model and the minimal data record length. Unlike most gradient descent algorithms for searching global minimum point, the proposed algorithm averts the rise of being trapped in a local minimum point. The major difference between this system and a general real-time spectrum estimation using FFT or a Kalman filter is that the proposed scheme can simultaneously identify instant variation of both integer and noninteger subharmonics with a few <b>iterative</b> <b>loops.</b> Numerical examples and the performance of the proposed algorithm are also presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{saddle point}} {{framework}} provides a convenient way to formulate many convex variational problems {{that occur in}} computer vi-sion. The framework unifies {{a broad range of}} data and regularization terms, and is particularly suited for nonsmooth problems such as To-tal Variation-based approaches to image labeling. However, for many interesting problems the constraint sets involved are difficult to han-dle numerically. State-of-the-art methods rely on using nested iterative projections, which induces both theoretical and practical convergence is-sues. We present a dual multiple-constraint Douglas-Rachford splitting approach that is globally convergent, avoids inner <b>iterative</b> <b>loops,</b> en-forces the constraints exactly, and requires only basic operations that can be easily parallelized. The method outperforms existing methods by a factor of 4 − 20 while considerably increasing the numerical robustness. ...|$|R
