40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) {{is being}} {{regarded}} as a promising green propellant for space propulsion due to its extremely low toxicity compared to traditional hydrazine propellant. Recently, we reported Ir and Fe-substituted hexaaluminates were highly active and stable catalysts for N 2 O decomposition [1, 2]. In the present work, we made a detailed study on the BaFexAl 12 -xO 19 hexaaluminate catalysts, with focus on {{the role played by}} the framework Fe in the N 2 O decomposition. Figure 1 shows the N 2 O decomposition activity of BaFexAl 12 -xO 19 catalysts (x= 0, 1, 2, 3) as a function of reaction temperature. BaAl 12 O 19 which does not contain Fe was almost inactive over the whole investigated temperature range, indicating Fe is the active component. When x increased from 1 to 2, the activity increased significantly. Figure 2 <b>illustrates</b> <b>the</b> <b>XRD</b> patterns of the BaFexAl 12 -xO 19 catalysts. BaFexAl 12 -xO 19 tends to form monophasic materials (Ba-β-Al 2 O 3 or MP phase) in wide composition range [3]. When x= 0 and 1, the characteristic diffraction peaks of Ba-β-Al 2 O 3 were observed. For the Fe-containing sample, the patterns were shifted to low 2 θvalues comparing with BaAl 12 O 19, indicating that the substitution of Fe ions for Al ions took place. Moreover, with an increase in the Fe content, the MP phase was detected. 57 Fe Mössbauer spectra of BaFexAl 12 -xO 19 (x= 1, 2, 3) at room temperature are shown in the Figure 3. When x= 1, the spectrum was fitted by two doublets xx’ and yy’ with close values of quadrupole splitting (QS) and different values of isomer shift (IS). When x= 2 and 3, the spectra were fitted by three doublets xx’, yy’ and zz’, since a new doublet absorption with larger QS appeared in them. The obtained isomer shifts are small and fall in the range expected for high-spin ferric ions in oxide environments. The two doublets xx’ and yy’ could be assigned to high-spin Fe 3 + ions in octahedral coordination (O) and in tetrahedral coordination (T), respectively. The two peaks observed in the H 2 -TPR for BaFeAl 11 O 19 sample is in agreement with the Mössbauer assignment. The new doublet zz’ could be assigned to high-spin Fe 3 + in the trigonal bipyramid site, which is in the mirror plane of hexaaluminate. Similar QS has been observed in BaFe 12 O 19, which shows a MP-type phase. The framework Fe species were highly active for N 2 O decomposition. Specially, Fe 3 + ions located in the mirror plane are attributed to the most reactive Fe species. Vienna University of Technolog...|$|E
40|$|X-ray techniques, just as {{many other}} {{analytical}} methods, {{have been used in}} forensic science for several decades. The main applications of X-rays in the UK Forensic Science Service are in X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and X-radiography. The complementary techniques of XRD and XRF are used mainly in trace analysis. Traces may consist of drugs, paint flakes, glass fragments, hair and fibres (natural and man-made), slivers of metal, soils, building materials, stains of any description, corrosion products, and loose powdered materials. X-radiography has a role in the examination {{of a wide variety of}} objects, from thin, low density objects such as documents using soft X-rays, to more dense objects using harder X-rays.

40|$|X-ray powder {{diffraction}} (XRD) is {{an essential}} component of research into use of organometallic precursors as a route to low temperature (< 500 “C) synthesis of bulk compound semiconductors. This paper <b>illustrates</b> <b>the</b> use of <b>XRD</b> to study solid solution behavior in the systems SnS-SnSe and PbS-CdS. XRD characterization demonstrated that phase pure intermediate members of the Sn(S,Se) solid solution prepared by this low temperature route showed the typical dependence of unit cell parameters on composition. PbS-CdS exhibits essentially no solid solution behavior at low temperatures according to established phase diagrams. Characterization of organometallic precursor thermolysis products with intermediate compositions initially suggested that a metastable solid solution with perhaps 30 % of CdS in PbS could be prepared at 150 °C. More detailed XRD and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) characterization indicated that the CdS was in fact present as a separate phase with such small crystallites (2 - 5 nm) that peak broadening made it essentially undetectable in concentrations below 30 %. The actual amount of solid solution was 2 % or less of CdS in PbS...|$|R
40|$|Alkaline {{electrochemical}} advanced oxidation {{processes for}} chromium oxidation and Cr-contaminated waste disposal were reported in this study. The highly graphitized multi-walled carbon nanotubes g-MWCNTs modified electrode was prepared for the in-situ electrochemical generation of HO 2 -. RRDE test results illustrated that g-MWCNTs exhibited much higher two-electron oxygen reduction activity than other nanocarbon materials with peak current density of 1. 24 mA cm(- 2), %HO 2 - of 77. 0 % and onset potential of - 0. 15 V (vs. Hg/HgO). It was originated from the highly graphitized structure and good electrical conductivity as <b>illustrated</b> from <b>the</b> Raman, <b>XRD</b> and EIS characterizations, respectively. Large amount of reactive oxygen species (HO 2 - and center dot OH) were in-situ electro-generated from the two-electron oxygen reduction and chromium-induced alkaline electro-Fenton-like reaction. The oxidation of Cr(III) was efficiently achieved within 90 min and the conversion ratio maintained more than 95 % of the original value after stability test, offering an efficient and green approach for the utilization of Cr-containing wastes.

The Mn 2 + EPR can serve as the method of the rapid analysis of mixed-polytype zinc sulfide powders and powders and XRD reflections which broadened (particle size less than 5  nm).
