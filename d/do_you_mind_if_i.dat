6000|$|... "We sold 'em off, when we parted {{with the}} farm. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have another cigarette? That was when I {{was quite a}} little chap, you know, that we had this ostrich farm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] she said, [...] "this {{afternoon}} I {{have had}} an idea? Some day I hope {{so much that it}} may come true. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> tell it you? It concerns yourself." ...|$|E

6000|$|She rose, {{and took}} his hand, and kissed it. [...] "I believe, if I was dying, I should get well enough {{to go out with}} you! May I ask one little favour? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> we don't go into the park today?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be foolish," [...] she laughed. [...] "I decline {{absolutely}} {{to believe}} that you had a single thought of me when you turned in here. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> say that I prefer not to believe it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not up to much,' he said. 'Look here, Grey, I've got {{rather an}} idea. It's my opinion Payne's not bucking up {{nearly as much}} as he might. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> leave him out of the next game?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, I {{was brought}} up near here," [...] he explained. [...] "I was sent from Scotland to stop with my aunt. It is highly {{probable}} that I may die here. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> light a pipe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "More or less, {{but never}} quite to this extent. The thing {{has become an}} {{obsession}} with him lately. If you {{are really going to}} stay and talk with me, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> we don't discuss my husband? Just now the subject is rather a painful one with me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{inventing the}} hairstyle, Heldt did not name it: {{for the final}} touch in her {{original}} design she added a bee-shaped hat pin and from that {{a reporter for the}} magazine Modern Beauty Shop (now Modern Salon) [...] "it looks just like a beehive! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> we call it the beehive?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've touched nothing until I've reached what I {{consider}} sanctuary," [...] he observed. [...] "My nerves {{have gone}} rotten {{for the first}} time in my life. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mind,</b> sir, <b>if</b> I lock the door?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no good," [...] he said suddenly, [...] "I can't keep it in. Molly, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> sing a bar or two? I've got a beastly voice, but I'm feeling rather happy. I'll stop {{as soon as}} I can." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{answering}} grin was ghastly and pathetic. [...] "I {{never could}} stand height," [...] Carson confessed.

6000|$|Harry {{stopped and}} leaned upon the table. [...] "Out into the {{clearing}} a little way. After that, I don't know. I don't want to spoil dad's plans by butting in before it's necessary, but I wish he'd told us what to <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> won't <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> we go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mitchy, as he partook of refreshment, kept up his {{thoughtful}} gaze. [...] "I shall presently {{want some}} more, please. But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> my asking <b>if</b> Van knew--" ...|$|R

6000|$|It {{was after}} the fourth drink that Sir Gerald asked humbly, [...] "What {{do you think of}} North Dakota mortgages?"
