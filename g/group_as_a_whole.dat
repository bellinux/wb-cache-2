5|$|Simultaneously, an {{unrelated}} movement of communal singing was established throughout the South and Western states. A format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in 1800. It used four sounds {{to symbolize the}} basic scale: fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi-fa. Each sound {{was accompanied by a}} specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing. The method was simple to learn and teach, so schools were established throughout the South and West. Communities would come together for an entire day of singing in a large building where they sat in four distinct areas surrounding an open space, one member directing the <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> Most of the music was Christian, but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual. Communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a Calvinistic sense of simplicity, so the songs were sung a cappella.|$|E
25|$|The Wu-Tang Clan has a {{wide range}} of {{collaborators}} and associates. Close collaborators to individual members or the <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> include or have included mainly East Coast-based artists, including Redman, Mobb Deep, Busta Rhymes, Erick Sermon, Nas, Pete Rock, and others.|$|E
25|$|Positive {{interdependence}} {{within a}} collaborative learning environment means that {{each member of}} the group contributes an individual effort to the task which is necessary for the whole group's success. The interdependence of this structure creates an environment in which all individuals are important to the <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> and the sharing of understandings, processes and ideas among members is common.|$|E
50|$|The Karen <b>groups</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> {{are often}} {{confused}} with the Padaung tribe, {{best known for the}} neck rings worn by their women, but they are just one sub-group of Red Karens (Karenni), one of the tribes of Kayah in Kayah State, Myanmar.|$|R

25|$|The Pamunkey, and all Virginia tribes, had an intimate, {{balanced}} {{relationship with}} the animals, plants, and the geography of their homeland. Like other native tribes, they had techniques, such as controlled burning, to clear land for cultivation or hunting. The land belonged to the <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> The chief and council would allot a parcel of cleared ground to a family head for life.|$|E
25|$|Some {{cultural}} events are organised {{for the island}} <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> For example, the Costa Book Awards are awarded to authors resident in the UK or Ireland.

The Mercury Music Prize is handed out every year to the best album from an Irish or British musician or group.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{retrospective}} {{studies have}} resulted in a concern about rosiglitazone's safety, although it is established that the <b>group,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> has beneficial effects on diabetes.

25|$|Originally, dikir barat {{was limited}} to {{competition}} between neighbouring villages, but in the 20th century, as its popularity began to spread (aided by the ability to record performances), it became a national phenomenon.

The behavior is disadvantageous to them individually but beneficial to the <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> and was thus seen by some to support the group selection theory.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the features required by the core API, graphics processing unit (GPU) vendors may provide additional functionality {{in the form of}} extensions. Extensions may introduce new functions and new constants, and may relax or remove restrictions on existing OpenGL functions. Vendors can use extensions to expose custom APIs without needing support from other vendors or the Khronos <b>Group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> which greatly increases the flexibility of OpenGL.

50|$|In the singular, Langue d'oïl {{refers to}} the {{mutually}} intelligible linguistic variants of lingua romana spoken since the 9th century in northern France and southern Belgium (Wallonia), since the 10th century in the Channel Islands, and between the 11th and 14th centuries in England (the Anglo-Norman language).

5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{inherited}} [...] "race character" [...] {{has long been}} used to characterize desirable versus undesirable qualities in members of <b>groups</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> along national, tribal, ethnic, religious and even class lines. Race character is predominantly used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> justification for the denigration and subsequent persecution of minority groups, most infamously, justifying European persecution of native Americans, the concept of slavery, and the Nazis' persecution of Jews. Though race character continues to be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> justification for persecution of minorities worldwide, it has been scientifically discredited and is not overtly a component of modern character education in western societies.|$|R
25|$|Synchronized skating (formerly {{known as}} {{precision}} skating) is for mixed-gender groups of 12 to 20 skaters. This discipline resembles a group form of ice dance with additional emphasis on precise formations of the <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> and complex transitions between formations. The basic formations include wheels, blocks, lines, circles, and intersections. The close formations {{and need for}} the team to stay in unison add {{to the difficulty of}} the footwork performed by the skaters in these elements. A formal proposal for inclusion in the Olympics was submitted by the International Skating Union to the International Olympic Committee in September 2014.|$|E
25|$|Militants {{published}} a newspaper, The Waterfront Worker, {{which focused on}} longshoremen's most pressing demands: more men on each gang, lighter loads and an independent union. While {{a number of the}} individuals in this group were Communist Party members, the <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> was independent of the party: although it criticized the International Seamen's Union (ISU) as weak and the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), which had its base on the East Coast, as corrupt, it did not embrace the MWIU, but called instead for creation of small knots of activists at each port to serve as {{the first step in a}} slow, careful movement to unionize the industry.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, all {{activities}} for the <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> were halted due to Stephanie sustaining a major back injury.

Since the performance the members wanted to focus on their solo activities and the group has then been taking an indefinite hiatus. In 2011, Dana and Sunday formed the first sub-unit of the group called 'The Grace Dana' and was mainly active in 2011. Now for members Dana, Sunday & Lina appeared in several musicals and Stephanie made her debut as a solo artist in 2011 with Media Line Entertainment, and moved to Mafia Records in 2014.|$|E

30|$|Explanations {{for higher}} rates of {{educational}} mismatch among migrants tend to centre on labour market discrimination. If migrant groups find {{it more difficult to}} acquire a suitable job, they may well be more likely to take a job that is not commensurate with their qualifications, resulting in higher proportions being overeducated. With the level of educational attainment rising amongst migrant <b>groups</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> discrimination, if reflected in greater levels of mismatch and thus lower earnings and job satisfaction, may place doubts on the importance of human capital attainment <b>as</b> <b>an</b> avenue for escaping disadvantage (Leslie and Drinkwater, 1999).|$|R
5|$|Replacement {{pilots were}} pushed through an {{abbreviated}} training regimen {{in order to}} meet the short-term needs of the fleet.

These inexperienced pilots were fed into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share <b>an</b> increased workload <b>as</b> conditions grew more desperate, with few being given a chance to rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air <b>groups</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> progressively deteriorated during the war while their American adversaries continued to improve.|$|R
25|$|The Days of Rage {{took place}} {{shortly after the}} June Convention, during {{the second week of}} October that fall. Taking place once again in Chicago, they were a {{consequence}} of the Weatherman faction seizing control of the student-run organization and convincing the <b>group</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> for the need of a full-fledged revolution. During the Days of Rage, “young radicals invested militant action with special power to enlighten, inspire, and mobilize”. This event “provided a way for them to establish the authenticity of their commitments, to assert their dissident or ‘revolutionary’ identities, and to live what they considered meaningful and engaged lives. The Weathermen had anticipated “at least 25,000 people” were to attend the Days of Rage; however, “instead of the promised 25,000 white youth ready to tear up ‘pig city,’” a mere “700 to 800 people gathered” half of them spectators. The four-day spectacle opened the Weathermen’s eyes to the fact that because of their tactics, they would not gain the support that they had originally intended on gathering.|$|E

40|$|Based {{on social}} {{categorisation}} {{theory and the}} similarity attraction paradigm, we propose that {{a high degree of}} ethno/lingo diversity in knowledge-intensive work groups, especially short-term ones, can inhibit knowledge sharing among members. Barriers identified in the knowledge sharing literature include trust, communication, and informal social interaction. A semi-quantitative approach was applied, involving a group collaborative decision making task. The results of the research task show that knowledge sharing within <b>groups</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> suffers <b>as</b> ethnic and linguistic diversity increase for short term groups. The findings provide a starting point for theory development and suggest creating more homogeneous groups for short-term tasks...|$|R
50|$|Despite her {{relocation}} to {{the town}} of Mount Dora, Florida various internationally known musicians sought her out to explore new looks and create costumes that promoted their developing stage personas. This work varied between designing for <b>groups</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> or focusing on the individual. Examples of working with groups include designs influenced by traditional Middle eastern costume produced for Todd Rundgren and the group Utopia during their ‘Egyptian’ phase following the recording of the album Ra. Another are the designs produced for the group Manowar, inspired by the comic-book and film character, Conan the Barbarian.|$|R
