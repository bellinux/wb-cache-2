5000|$|The {{national}} currency of the Republic of Armenia is dram (ISO code - AMD, the sign - [...] ). One dram {{is equal to}} hundred luma. The CBA is vested with the exclusive right to issue currency. The {{national currency}} was put into circulation on 22 November 1993.The design of the graphical symbol (sign) of the Dram of the Republic of Armenia authored by Karen Komendaryan and Ruben Arutchyan was approved and chosen out of the other design proposals under the Central Bank of Armenia Board Resolution No. 25, dated 09.10.2001. The sign of the Dram was registered in the State Standard of the Republic of Armenia in 2007 and in the ISO/UNICODE international standards in 2012. On September 21, 1991 Armenia was proclaimed as an independent republic. On this occasion there arouse a {{need to create a}} national currency. On 27 March 1992 the name was chosen for the Armenian currency, the Dram, and sketches of the future banknotes were prepared. The first series of banknotes of 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 500 dram entered into circulation on 22 November 1993. Then, in 1994 banknote series was added with the banknote of 1 000 dram denomination, and later, in 1995, with 5 000 dram banknote. The design of the banknotes contained images of modern and historic, architectural and cultural monuments of Armenia. While working on the first series of banknotes, the Central Bank of the Republic of Armenia actually started a tradition of representing on them the most important aspects of the Armenian cultural and historical heritage. Banknotes of the first series circulated until 2005, although since 1995, work began on the development of a new, second series of banknotes. The design concept changed definitely. Banknotes became more sophisticated in terms of technical parameters: they were more in line with international standards and the latest international trends. The banknotes which replaced the first series began portraying the most famous personalities who have left an invaluable imprint on the culture and historical heritage of Armenia. In the period from 1999 to 2010 banknotes of 50, 100, 500, 1 000, 5 000, 10 000, 20 000, 100 000 dram were in circulation. The first two of them are not circulating nowadays. On the 4th of June 2001 the first commemorative banknote of 50 000 dram to celebrate the 1700th anniversary of the adoption of Christianity as state religion in Armenia was issued. The design of the banknote was different from the general concept adopted for the second series of the Armenian banknotes. The banknotes of the second series, including the commemorative one, were re-issued in the form of reprints, keeping with the overall design as well as inscriptions. In the process of reprinting particular attention was paid to improving the security of banknotes and bettering their overall quality. Nearly all the achievements of modern security technologies - varnishing, use of holograms, OVI, etc. - were introduced. The number of security features at the moment reaches 17, which is why the Armenian banknotes are able to meet the highest standards accepted in security printing. The most important work was done during the last reprint of banknotes of 1 000, 5 000, 10 000 and 20 000 dram banknotes. All design elements were optimized and consolidated; modern security features appeared not only on the obverse, but on the reverse of the banknotes as well. This work has earned high praise of international community. In particular, at the international conference of banknotes in Singapore in 2011 this approach was considered relevant and effective. The current circulation is difficult to imagine without circulating coins. The first series of circulation coins was issued in Armenia in 1994. Those were the coins with nominal value of 10, 20, 50 luma and 1, 3, 5, 10 dram. Furthermore, since 2003, the second series coins with nominal value of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 dram were issued. The highest nominal value of the series, 500 dram, was issued in order to replace banknotes of the same nominal value. All the coins, except for 10, 20, 50 luma and 1, 3, 5 dram, which quickly lost their relevance due to high inflation at the time, were struck several times. In 1996-1997, circulation commemorative coins (two copper-nickel coins dedicated to the 32nd Chess Olympiad and the 100th anniversary of the birth of Charents, and a gold coin dedicated to the goddess Anahit) were issued for the first time. The next issue of commemorative coins in 2012 was noteworthy as an interesting and modern concept was being first implemented. In addition to 50 dram circulation coins with standard design, commemorative coins with identical specifications were issued in dedication to the 10 regions of Armenia and the Armenian capital Yerevan. The obverse of these coins depicted the most typical images associated with the regions they represent. All commemorative coins are in circulation {{on a par with the}} standard ones and are a good source of increased interest among collectors. In pursuit of learning from the experience of countries such as the United States, Austria, Canada, etc., starting 2011 the Central Bank of Armenia has been issuing silver bullion coins of the series [...] "Noah's Ark". These coins represent 7 weight categories - from 1/4 oz to 5 kg. The purpose of the project is to provide opportunities for households to invest their extra money in silver coins. A well-chosen theme of the issue as well as excellent quality made it possible to sell over million pieces of these coins in just a year. The concept of reflecting most important cultural and historical aspects on banknotes and coins is most clearly and vividly realized in the <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> <b>collector</b> <b>coins.</b> From 1994 to date, more than 170 high-quality collector coins have been issued. These coins are dedicated to the Armenian state, great Armenian generals, history of Armenian currency, formation of the Armed Forces of Armenia. Many coins have also been issued to commemorate birth anniversaries of renowned people of science, literature, culture, and sports. Much attention is given to Christian values: these are ancient temples and churches, and spiritual values of the past. The diversity of animal and plant life is reflected in the issues that deal with rare and unique species of fauna and flora of Armenia. Planned and systematic work to improve the quality of the banknotes and coins in Armenia could not be left unappreciated. Many issues have won awards at the most prestigious international numismatic forums. This book, dedicated to the 20th anniversary of Armenian dram, contains the most comprehensive list of issues of notes and coins of Armenia. We hope that this work will be interesting and useful not only for numismatists, but also for those who takes interest in Armenia with its rich culture and history.|$|E

50|$|A self-directed IRA {{can hold}} {{precious}} metals, which are typically {{held by a}} third-party custodian. The regulations pertaining to investing in precious metals are in Section 408(m)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Some US government minted coins (American Eagles and American Buffalo) are permissible. Bullion is also permissible if it meets a standard level of fineness, and is produced by a COMEX or NYMEX approved refiner. In order for coins to be held inside an IRA, coins must satisfy {{a certain level of}} pureness in their mineral content so that they are not viewed as a type <b>of</b> <b>collector’s</b> <b>coin.</b> As a result, Double Eagle gold coins (minted in the United States in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries) and South African Krugerrands are disallowed because they do not meet this standard.|$|R
