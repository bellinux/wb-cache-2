50|$|The tendon of the tibialis {{posterior}} muscle (sometimes {{called the}} posterior tibial tendon) descends posterior to the medial malleolus and terminates by dividing into plantar, main, and recurrent components. <b>The</b> plantar portion <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bases of the second, {{third and fourth}} metatarsals, the intermediate and lateral cuneiforms and the cuboid. <b>The</b> main portion <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tuberosity of the navicular and the plantar surface of the medial cuneiform. <b>The</b> recurrent portion <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus.|$|R
5000|$|The subscapular nerves are {{innervated by}} the {{posterior}} {{division of the}} brachial plexus. These nerves {{are part of a}} group of nerves that innervate the muscles that move the scapula. [...] The upper subscapular nerve <b>inserts</b> directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> upper portion of the subscapularis muscle, thus innervating it. The lower subscapular nerve contains two branches. One branch <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lower portion of the subscapularis muscle and <b>the</b> other branch <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> teres major.|$|R

5|$|Following the Mexican Revolution, the new {{government}} began persecuting the Church. To destroy the Church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics {{that resulted in the}} deaths of thousands, including several priests who were also knights of Columbus. Known as the Mexican martyrs, these men have been canonized.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> ECRL <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dorsal {{surface of}} {{the base of the}} second {{metacarpal}} bone on its radial side to extend and abduct the wrist. <b>The</b> ECRB <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lateral dorsal {{surface of the}} base of the third metacarpal bone, with a few fibres <b>inserting</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> medial dorsal surface of the second metacarpal bone, also to extend and abduct the wrist. <b>The</b> ED <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> middle and distal phalanges to extend the fingers and wrist. Opposite the head of the second metacarpal bone, the EI joins the ulnar side of the ED tendon to extend the index finger. The EDM has a similar role for the little finger. The ECU inserts {{at the base of the}} 5th metacarpal to extend and adduct the wrist. <b>The</b> APL <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> radial side of the base of the first metacarpal bone to abduct the thumb at the carpometacarpal joint and may continue to abduct the wrist. <b>The</b> EPB <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> base of the first phalanx of the thumb to extend and abduct the thumb at the carpometacarpal and MCP joints.The EPL inserts on the base of the distal phalanx of the thumb. It uses the dorsal tubercle on the radius as fulcrum to help the EPB with its action as well as extending the distal phalanx of the thumb. Because the index finger and little finger have separate extensors, these fingers can be moved more independently than the other fingers.|$|R

5|$|The {{piercing}} needle: The {{standard method}} in the United States involves making an opening using a beveled-tip hollow medical needle, {{which is available}} in different lengths, gauges and even shapes. While straight needles are useful for many body parts, curved needles are manufactured for areas where straight needles are not ideal. The needle selected is typically the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with cartilage piercings) as the initial jewellery to be worn, with higher gauges indicating thinner needles. The needle is <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> body part being pierced, frequently by hand but sometimes {{with the aid of}} a needle holder or pusher. While the needle is still in the body, the initial jewellery to be worn in the piercing is pushed through the opening, following the back of the needle. Jewellery is often <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hollow end of a needle, so that as the needle pulls through the jewellery is left behind.|$|E
5000|$|Pectoral muscles: {{there are}} 4 pectorals, {{and they all}} {{function}} in adduction of the limb. The pectoralis descendens (cranial superficial pectoral) originates from the cariniform cartilage of <b>the</b> sternum, and <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> humerus. The pectoralis transversus (transverse superficial pectoral) originates from the ventral side of the sternum and inserts on the proximal third of the horse's forearm. The largest of the pectorals, the pectoralis profundus (caudal deep pectoral), originates on the caudal side of <b>the</b> sternum, and <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> humerus and onto the tendon of the coracobrachialis muscle. The pectoralis ascendens (caudal superficial pectoral), or the subclavius, originates on the cranial side of <b>the</b> sternum, and <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dorsal side of the supraspinatus muscle.|$|R

50|$|The plantaris muscle {{arises from}} the {{inferior}} part of the lateral supracondylar ridge of the femur at a position slightly superior to {{the origin of the}} lateral head of gastrocnemius. It passes posterior to the knee joint in an inferomedial direction and becomes tendinous distally to <b>insert</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Achilles tendon. It occasionally separately <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> medial side of the calcaneus.|$|R
5|$|After Leonard I. Schiff {{calculated}} that an initiator could theoretically improve {{the efficiency of}} a gun-type fission weapon, Oppenheimer gave approval on 15 March 1945 for initiators {{to be included in}} the Little Boy design. Testing was carried out to ensure that the initiators were rugged enough to handle being transported in an airplane and being accidentally dropped. Eventually, about forty initiators were despatched to Tinian, where four were <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bomb that was used in the bombing of Hiroshima.|$|E
5|$|An X-ray of {{swallowed}} barium {{may be used}} {{to reveal}} {{the size and shape of}} the esophagus, and the presence of any masses. The esophagus may also be imaged using a flexible camera <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> esophagus, in a procedure called an endoscopy. If an endoscopy is used on the stomach, the camera will also have to pass through the esophagus. During an endoscopy, a biopsy may be taken. If cancer of the esophagus is being investigated, other methods, including a CT scan, may also be used.|$|E
5|$|An intubating stylet is a {{malleable}} metal wire {{designed to be}} <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> endotracheal tube to make the tube conform better to the upper airway anatomy of the specific individual. This aid is commonly used with a difficult laryngoscopy. Just as with laryngoscope blades, there are also several types of available stylets, such as the Verathon Stylet, which is specifically designed to follow the 60° blade angle of the GlideScope video laryngoscope.|$|E
5000|$|The {{latissimus dorsi}} can be remembered best for {{insertion}} as [...] "The Lady Between Two Majors". As <b>the</b> latissimus dorsi <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{floor of the}} intertubercular groove of the humerus it is surrounded by two major muscles. The teres major inserts medially on the medial lip of the intertubercular groove and laterally <b>the</b> pectoralis major <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lateral lip.|$|R

5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} oral contraceptives since the hormones in them {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. Intrauterine devices could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced. Diaphrams that require something to be <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function. An option of choice for women is for partners to use condoms.|$|E
5|$|Due to his red card {{suspension}} in the World Cup, Gourcuff missed two call-ups to {{the national}} team in August and September. In October 2010, he was called back into the team by his former manager at Bordeaux Laurent Blanc for UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying matches against Romania and Luxembourg. In the match against Romania, Gourcuff appeared as a substitute and scored the final goal in the team's 2–0 victory. He was <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> starting lineup against Luxembourg and responded by assisting on the opening goal scored by Karim Benzema and scoring the second goal in another 2–0 win.|$|E
5|$|Gourcuff is a French inter{{national}}. Prior {{to playing}} at senior level, he {{played on the}} under-19 team that won the 2005 European Under-19 Football Championship. Gourcuff made his senior national team debut in August 2008. He scored his first international goal two months later against Romania. Gourcuff made his first major tournament appearance for France at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Since joining the national team, he has been <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> playmaker role, a position that was vacated and never filled following the retirement of Zidane in 2006.|$|E
50|$|The UCL’s {{consist of}} the ulnolunate and the ulnotriquetral ligaments. They {{originate}} from the ulnar styloid and <b>insert</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> carpal {{bones of the}} wrist: <b>the</b> ulnolunate ligament <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> lunate bone and <b>the</b> ulnotriquetral ligament <b>into</b> <b>the</b> triquetrum bone. These ligaments prevent dorsal migration of the distal ulna. They are more taut during supination, because in supination ulnar styloid {{moves away from the}} carpal bones volar side.|$|R
5000|$|Serratus ventralis: {{includes}} the serratus cervicus, which originates {{from the final}} 4-5 cervical vertebrae and <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> scapula, and the serratus thoracis, which originates on the lateral side of the first 8-9 ribs and <b>inserts</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> scapula. The two muscles are antagonists to each other, with the serratus cervicus pulling the scapula towards the neck, and the serratus thoracis pulling the scapula away from the neck. They help move the forelimb forward and back.|$|R
50|$|The fibers of teres major <b>insert</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> medial {{lip of the}} intertubercular sulcus of the humerus.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to making secretory proteins, the rough ER makes membranes that grows in place from {{the addition of}} proteins and phospholipids. As polypeptides intended to be membrane proteins grow from the ribosomes, they are <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ER membrane itself and are kept there by their hydrophobic portions. The rough ER also produces its own membrane phospholipids; enzymes built into the ER membrane assemble phospholipids. The ER membrane expands and can be transferred by transport vesicles to other components of the endomembrane system.|$|E
5|$|Pre-moulded or {{machined}} components can be <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cavity while the mould is open, allowing the material injected {{in the next}} cycle to form and solidify around them. This process is known as Insert moulding and allows single parts to contain multiple materials. This process {{is often used to}} create plastic parts with protruding metal screws, allowing them to be fastened and unfastened repeatedly. This technique can also be used for In-mould labelling and film lids may also be attached to moulded plastic containers.|$|E
5|$|St Edern's Church, Bodedern (sometimes {{referred}} to as St Ederyn's Church) is a medieval parish church {{in the village of}} Bodedern, in Anglesey, north Wales. Although St Edern established a church in the area in the 6th century, the oldest parts of the present building date from the 14th century. Subsequent alterations include the addition of some windows in the 15th century, and a chancel, transept and porch in the 19th century, when the nave walls were largely rebuilt. Stained glass was also <b>inserted</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> windows of the chancel and transept.|$|E
