The numerical results compare favourably with experimental results. Parametric studies are carried out to evaluate the influence of loading type, span-depth ratio, combined reinforcement index (CRI), partial prestressing ratio, concrete compressive strength, and ratio of compressive reinforcement, etc. on the ductility behaviour. The results indicate that the curvature <b>ductility</b> <b>factor</b> of prestressed concrete members with unbonded tendons decreases with the increase of CRI. The curvature ductility factors for members with bonded and unbonded tendons for given values of CRI are also analyzed and compared. It is generally observed that when the CRI is between 0. 15 and 0. 20, the <b>ductility</b> <b>factor</b> of an unbonded member is close to that of the bonded one. Above this range of CRI the <b>ductility</b> <b>factor</b> of an unbonded member is higher than that of a bonded one, while below this range the <b>ductility</b> <b>factor</b> of an unbonded member is lower than that of a bonded one. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The structure was modeled by a two-dimensional frame with girders and columns having bilinear bending moment-end rotation hysteretic characteristics.

The earthquakes used were the El Centro (N-S) earthquake of May 18, 1940 and several pseudo-earthquakes having statistics {{similar to those of}} previously recorded earthquakes.

A displacement envelope and a plot of the <b>ductility</b> <b>factors,</b> which measure the amount of yielding incurred, are also given. It was possible to identify certain behavior characteristics of the structural responses which appeared to be determined more by the properties of the structure than by the earthquake. For the series of pseudo-earthquakes used, a large range was found in the maximum values of the responses of the yielding structure. For example, the spread between extremum values of the maximum absolute displacements was 50 per cent of the arithmetic mean value.

The effect of using different code-specified lateral load patterns on the seismic performance of fixed-base buildings has been investigated by researchers during the past two decades.

In the present study, through intensive parametric analyses of 21, 600 linear and nonlinear MDOF systems and considering five different shear strength and stiffness distribution patterns, including three code-specified patterns as well as uniform and concentric patterns subjected to a group of earthquakes recorded on alluvium and soft soils, the effect of structural characteristics distribution on the strength demand and <b>ductility</b> reduction <b>factor</b> of MDOF fixed-base and soil-structure systems are parametrically investigated.

Knowledge of the {{strength and}} ductility of the pile within its embedded length in the foundation material is of importance due to the large deformations which can occur during an earthquake, particularly at the interface of hard and soft layers of foundation material. Connection details are of interest since high moments, shears and axial forces need {{to be transferred to}} pile caps during earthquake loading. Two series of tests of piles and their connections, and accompanying analyses, were conducted. Design tables and charts were derived. The first test series consisted of six full scale octagonal prestressed concrete piles, confined spirally with either Grade 275 steel or hard drawn (Grade 485) steel wire and having various confinement levels, tested under axial load and cyclic flexure. Results of the theoretical analysis were compared with the experimental data. It was found that properly detailed prestressed concrete piles without additional nonprestressed longitudinal steel can sustain large displacement <b>ductility</b> <b>factors</b> without losing their lateral load carrying capacity significantly if confined according to full ductility. The second test series consisted of six full scale octagonal piles connected to full scale reinforced pile caps. The piles were either fully or partially prestressed. Three types of pile to pile cap connection were investigated, namely the precast embedded type, the stripped pile head type, and the type where steel dowel bars are used as the connection device.

Similarly, the effect of drift ratio on the coefficient of 			equivalent viscous damping was also studied. Various performance 			levels for unreinforced brick masonry piers, in relation to drift 			ratios, were also recommended. 			Based {{on the results of}} experimental work, a methodology was 			proposed for lateral strength assessment of unreinforced brick 			masonry buildings. The developed methodology produced satisfactory 			results when compared with the results of full-scale unreinforced 			masonry (URM) buildings tested at University of Pavia, Italy [MKC 			 95] and Georgia Institute of Technology, USA [Yi 04]. Although the 			proposed methodology was used for brick masonry buildings, it can be 			applied to other types of masonry (such as stone and concrete block 			masonry constructed in cement: sand mortar, lime mortar, etc.) if 			the properties required to quantify the seismic performance (e. g., 			displacement <b>ductility</b> <b>factors</b> and ultimate drift ratios of masonry 			piers, etc.) are experimentally known. Various performance levels 			for unreinforced brick masonry buildings were also recommended in 			relation to drift ratios. 			Finally, seismic capacities of thirty-one buildings were evaluated. 			The buildings stock consisted of seventeen single-story and 			fourteen double-story buildings. The buildings were selected keeping 			in view their common typological use in urban areas of Northern 			Pakistan. Fragility curves, showing the probabilities of reaching or 			exceeding various performance levels at various levels of ground 			shaking, were drawn for various performance limit states. It was 			found by studying the  fragility curves that the probability of 			occurrence for various performance levels of single- and double- 			story buildings do not differ significantly. It was also concluded 			that unreinforced brick masonry, if properly constructed, can be 			safely used in localities placed in seismic zone 2 b [BCP 07] and 			below...|$|R
40|$|Project {{presents}} an analytical method for {{the prediction of}} inelastic response of RC beam columns under both monotonic and cyclic loading up to large deformation stage. Several computer programs were developed for the prediction of moment-curvature and lateral load-lateral displacement curves from which <b>ductility</b> <b>factors</b> were derived. Beam-columns are structural members subjected to combined flexure and axial compression. Response of reinforced concrete (RC) beam-columns to loading is significantly nonlinear due {{to the effect of}} axial load on bending moment and the nonlinearity in material response. Formation of cracks, bond deterioration between reinforcing steel and surrounding concrete, post-peak softening and localised failure mechanism are factors that induce more complexities in the prediction of the inelastic response of RC beam-columns. Design of RC beam-columns in seismic regions is governed by the ductility consideration. Experimental results indicate that ductility is significantly enhanced by the confinement provided by the transverse reinforcements. This thesis {{presents an}} analytical method for the prediction of the inelastic response of RC beam- columns under cyclic (including monotonic) loading up to large deformation stage. The response is represented the form of moment-curvature and lateral load-lateral displacement curves from which <b>ductility</b> <b>factors</b> are derived. The response of RC beam-column was observed to be a function of the response of its constituent materials. Well-established stress-strain relations for steel and concretes were used in this research. The effect of transverse reinforcement was included in the material model. An analytical tool the form of computer programs was developed. The accuracy of the results predicted by the computer programs was verified using experimental results of twelve RC beam-column specimens published the literature. Comparison between the results of the computer programs and the experimental results showed very good agreement, thus validating the programs. Sensitivity of the design parameters on the response ofRC beam-columns to monotonic and cyclic loadings was studied using the computer programs. The design parameters that were considered this study include (1) volumetric ratio of transverse steel, (2) yield strength of transverse steel, (3) level of compressive axial load, (4) compressive strength of concrete, (5) yield strength of longitudinal steel and (6) longtudinal steel ratio. The results of these sensitivity analyses have the potential to be used by the design engineers for the selection of the most appropriate design variables for specific performance requirements...|$|R
