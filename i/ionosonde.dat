As the frequency increases, each wave is refracted less by the ionization in the layer, and so each penetrates further before it is reflected. Eventually, a frequency is reached that enables the wave to penetrate the layer without being reflected. For ordinary mode waves, this occurs when the transmitted frequency just exceeds the peak plasma, or critical, frequency of the layer. Tracings of the reflected high frequency radio pulses are known as ionograms.

50|$|The Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN) is {{an array}} of {{ground-based}} radio instruments deployed in the Canadian Arctic and operated by the University of New Brunswick. The CHAIN instruments include high data-rate GPS receivers and digital <b>ionosondes.</b> After passing through the Earth's ionosphere, microwave GPS signals carry information about the total electron content (TEC). This information is commonly used to improve the precision of GPS and to study ionospheric morphology. <b>Ionosondes</b> transmit pulses of radio signals in the Medium Frequency (MF) and High Frequency (HF) ranges, whose echos are analyzed to measure height and density of the ionosphere.

The height was lowest when the airglow intensity reached a maximum between 1640 and 1700 UT. However, at Chiang Mai, the height increased slightly from 250  km at 1600 UT to 280  km at 1640 UT when the MBW was observed at Kototabang.|$|R
30|$|Many studies report STIDs {{triggered}} by the 11 March, 2011, M 9.0 Tohoku Earthquake by means of TEC (total electron content) derived from ground-based GPS receivers of GEONET (Maruyama et al., 2011; Rolland et al., 2011; Tsai et al., 2011) and ionograms of <b>ionosondes</b> (Maruyama et al., 2011). Three different STIDs are observed by the 5 <b>ionosondes</b> after the earthquake. The 1 st STIDs with rather small disturbed amplitudes but very high propagation speeds of 2100 – 3200 m/s (2.1 – 3.2 km/s) which is in agreement with 3 km/s by Rolland et al. (2011) and 2.3 km/s by Tsai et al. (2011). The high speed waves might be induced by vertical motions of the solid Earth’s surface of Rayleigh waves of the earthquake. Due to the high speed of 2 – 4 km/s and relatively short duration of several seconds/minutes, it requires some coincidence for <b>ionosondes</b> to observe STIDs {{triggered by}} the Rayleigh waves.|$|R
