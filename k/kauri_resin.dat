50|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries Kauri gum (semi-fossilised <b>kauri</b> <b>resin)</b> was a {{valuable}} commodity, particularly for varnish, spurring {{the development of}} a gum-digger industry.|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} the test itself, the kauri-butanol value (Kb) of a {{chemical}} shows {{the maximum amount of}} the hydrocarbon that can be added to a solution of <b>kauri</b> <b>resin</b> (a thick, gum-like material) in butyl alcohol without causing cloudiness. Since <b>kauri</b> <b>resin</b> is readily soluble in butyl alcohol but not in most hydrocarbon solvents, the resin solution will tolerate only a certain amount of dilution. [...] "Stronger" [...] solvents such as benzene can be added in a greater amount (and thus have a higher Kb value) than [...] "weaker" [...] solvents like mineral spirits.|$|E
50|$|Various {{species of}} <b>kauri</b> give diverse <b>resins</b> such as <b>kauri</b> copal, Manilla copal and Dammar gum. The timber is {{generally}} straight-grained and of fine quality with an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and rot resistance, making it ideal for yacht hull construction. The wood {{is commonly used}} {{in the manufacture of}} guitars and ukuleles due to its light weight and relatively low price of production. It is also used for some Go boards (goban). The uses of the New Zealand species (A. australis) included shipbuilding, house construction, wood panelling, furniture making, mine braces, and railway sleepers.|$|R
50|$|A {{cemetery}} {{established on}} a high promontory overlooking the harbour has the remains of many early settlers and is still used for burials. A camp ground was established on the reserve and was run by the local community until 1997 when control {{was taken over by}} the Rodney District Council. Horse races used to be held on the mudflats of the harbour at low-tide. The community also developed sports fields on the reserve and it remains a popular site for various sports fostered by the Rodney Rams Sports Club. The clubhouse itself was destroyed by fire in 2014.Whangateau was a centre for trade during the 1800s as there were no roads and all traffic was by sea. The recently restored Big Omaha wharf was used to berth coastal shipping taking apples and <b>kauri</b> gum (<b>resin)</b> to the Auckland markets. It was adjacent to two important ship building facilities owned by the Darrochs and Meiklejohns where many of the early coastal vessels were built.|$|R
30|$|One of the {{limitations}} of kauri for dendroclimatic study is that it currently only naturally occurs in the north of New Zealand, from approximately Te Puke/Kawhia (~ 38 °S) to Cape Reinga (~ 34 °S). Despite this, planted kauri grow successfully in numerous areas outside their natural range (Pardy et al. [1992]). There are individual specimens or small groups growing as far south as Invercargill (~ 46.5 °S) and even Stewart Island (~ 47 °S), and kauri are routinely planted as ornamental trees around the country (Niinemets et al. [2005]). Their success in planted stands throughout New Zealand is less surprising after looking at the fossil record. Early records of kauri showed the species occurring in geographically and climatically distinct environmental conditions to the modern day. For example, Lee et al. ([2007]) reported leaf macrofossils in Southland during the late Oligocene-early Miocene, and Evans ([1937]) identified <b>kauri</b> <b>resin</b> in fossilised material in Tertiary lignite deposits from the Roxburgh (~ 45.5 °S) and Mataura (~ 46 °S) areas in the South Island. Araucarian ancestors of kauri first appeared in the Cretaceous period (Lee et al. [2007]). More relevant to the current distribution of kauri, however, are the findings of Mildenhall ([1985]), who noted extensive palynological evidence of kauri around 300, 000 BP (before present) at Lower Hutt in Wellington (~ 41 °S), a period during which southern hemisphere climate was significantly cooler than at present (Petit et al. [1999]; Jouzel et al. [2007]). Pleistocene evidence of a more extensive distribution for kauri (Ecroyd [1982]) has led numerous authors to speculate on the causes of the failure of this species to recolonise land further south in recent times (e.g. Mitchell [1991]; Ogden et al. [1992], [1993]). A number of reasons have been suggested, including climatic limitation, lack of suitable soils and terrain, and simply slow expansion due to episodic stand regeneration (Ogden et al. [1992]; Steward and Beveridge [2010]). Recent permanent regeneration from planted stands south of the current natural limit suggest that kauri may only just be in a process of extending its range, recently curtailed by the episodic glaciations of the Quaternary period (Steward et al. [2003]).|$|E
