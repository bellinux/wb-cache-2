5|$|The {{headgear}} of {{the typical}} Confederate Infantryman was the slouch hat, or the military Kepi. The Kepi is a short fatigue and dress cap that was easy to manufacture for the Army during the war. This type of hat had its drawbacks, however. It provided little weather protection, and was worn out easily {{after a few months}} of <b>hard</b> <b>wear.</b> The Infantryman design cap was sky-blue with a dark blue band, but this was rarely seen outside of officer private-purchase caps. More typical would be the plain gray/brown cap, with or without the branch of service trim. There are examples of deep-south made caps that were trimmed in red cotton and wool, and issued to Infantry units, showing that any available clothing was issued to the troops as the war progressed.|$|E

2500|$|Clapton {{assembled}} the best {{components of the}} remaining three to create [...] "Blackie", which was his favourite stage guitar until its retirement in 1985. It was first played live [...] 1973 at the Rainbow Concert. Clapton called the 1956/57 Strat a [...] "mongrel". On [...] 2004, Clapton sold [...] "Blackie" [...] at Christie's Auction House, New York, for US$959,500 {{to raise funds for}} his Crossroads Centre for drug and alcohol addictions. [...] "Brownie" [...] is now on display at the Experience Music Project. The Fender Custom Shop has since produced a limited run of 275 'Blackie' replicas, correct in every detail right down to the 'Duck Brothers' flight case, and artificially aged using Fender's 'Relic' process to simulate years of <b>hard</b> <b>wear.</b> One was presented to Clapton upon the model's release and was used for three numbers during a concert at the Royal Albert Hall on [...] 2006.|$|E

60|$|I {{perceived}} the town from the triple viewpoint {{of a former}} resident, {{a man from the}} city, and a reformer, and every minutest detail of dress, tone and gesture revealed new meaning to me. Fancher and Gammons were feebler certainly, and a little more querulous with age, and their faded beards and rough hands gave pathetic evidence of the <b>hard</b> <b>wear</b> of wind and toil. At the moment nothing glozed the essential tragic futility of their existence.|$|E
60|$|Our {{conclusions}} are, then--that, {{while the}} clothing of children {{should never be}} in such excess as to create oppressive warmth, it should always be sufficient to prevent any general feeling of cold;[6] that, instead of the flimsy cotton, linen, or mixed fabrics commonly used, it should be made of some good non-conductor, such as coarse woollen cloth; {{that it should be}} so strong as to receive little damage from the <b>hard</b> <b>wear</b> and tear which childish sports will give it; and that its colours should be such as will not soon suffer from use and exposure.|$|E
60|$|This ring is a {{broad band}} of gold with a flat bezel upon which {{something}} was once engraved that owing to long and <b>hard</b> <b>wear</b> now cannot be distinguished. In short, {{it appears to be}} a signet of old European make but of what age and from what country it is impossible to determine. The other ring was in a small leathery pouch, elaborately embroidered in gold thread or very thin wire, which I suppose was part of the lady's costume. It is like a very massive wedding ring, but six or eight times as thick, and engraved all over with an embossed conventional design of what look like stars with rays round them, or possibly petalled flowers. Lastly there was the sword-hilt, of which presently.|$|E

60|$|Frank's boots had {{suffered}} from <b>hard</b> <b>wear</b> in the bush, and, {{as he had}} stumbled into a pool, his feet were very wet, but he crouched behind a boulder, clutching the single-barreled gun with cold fingers, and watching the sky beyond the fir tops, for what seemed a considerable time. Nothing moved across it except a long wisp of torn-edged cloud, and he was commencing to wonder whether {{it would not be}} better {{to go back to the}} sloop when Harry called softly, and he heard a new sound in the darkness somewhere beyond the firs. It suggested the regular movement of a row of fans, which was the best comparison that occurred to him, for there was a kind of measured beat in it, and in another few moments he recognized it as the rhythmic stroke of wings. Then a double line of dark bodies spreading out from a point in the shape of a wedge appeared close above him against the sky.|$|E
60|$|In plain prose, Selvagee was one {{of those}} {{officers}} whom the sight of a trim-fitting naval coat had captivated in the days of his youth. He fancied, that if a sea-officer dressed well, and conversed genteelly, he would abundantly uphold the honour of his flag, and immortalise the tailor that made him. On that rock many young gentlemen split. For upon a frigate's quarter-deck, {{it is not enough to}} sport a coat fashioned by a Stultz; it is not enough to be well braced with straps and suspenders; it is not enough to have sweet reminiscences of Lauras and Matildas. It is a right down life of <b>hard</b> <b>wear</b> and tear, and the man who is not, in a good degree, fitted to become a common sailor will never make an officer. Take that to heart, all ye naval aspirants. Thrust your arms up to the elbow in pitch and see how you like it, ere you solicit a warrant. Prepare for white squalls, living gales and typhoons; read accounts of shipwrecks and horrible disasters; peruse the Narratives of Byron and Bligh; familiarise yourselves with the story of the English frigate Alceste and the French frigate Medusa. Though you may go ashore, now and then, at Cadiz and Palermo; for every day so spent among oranges and ladies, you will have whole months of rains and gales.|$|E

50|$|In 1997, {{the cargo}} barge was {{converted}} to a hotel barge and underwent another refit in 2006. She was purchased by European Waterways in 2007. She was then taken to a boatyard in Belgium for inspection, maintenance and improvements. The hull has two wear strips welded outside the chine which mean the <b>hard</b> <b>wear</b> of rubbing against lock walls will be absorbed by this sacrificial steel strip.|$|E
5000|$|Granolithic: Granolithic is {{composed}} of cement and fine aggregate mortar, the aggregate being granite chippings, which will give the hard wearing quality of the finish.

50|$|A {{drawback}} of Bedrocks, {{shared with}} Baileys, is the thin iron, which were cheaper {{to produce and}} believed to be more easily sharpened. Indeed, on most Stanley irons the functional surface is laminated with <b>hard,</b> <b>wear</b> resistant steel in the first inch or so and mild steel {{in the remainder of}} the iron. Modern irons from other makers are much thicker and are 100 percent tool steel, hardened to about Rockwell 62.|$|E

50|$|Induction {{hardening}} is {{a surface}} hardening technique {{in which the}} surface of the metal is heated very quickly, using a no-contact method of induction heating. The alloy is then quenched, producing a martensite transformation at the surface while leaving the underlying metal unchanged. This creates a very <b>hard,</b> <b>wear</b> resistant surface while maintaining the proper toughness in the majority of the object. Crankshaft journals are a good example of an induction hardened surface.|$|E
5000|$|Case {{hardening}} processes harden {{only the}} exterior of the steel part, creating a <b>hard,</b> <b>wear</b> resistant skin (the [...] "case") but preserving a tough and ductile interior. Carbon steels are not very hardenable meaning they can not be hardened throughout thick sections. Alloy steels have a better hardenability, so they can through-hardened and do not require case hardening. This property of carbon steel can be beneficial, because it gives the surface good wear characteristics but leaves the core tough.|$|E
50|$|The small, {{portable}} carousel {{outside the}} circus building was made about 1920 by the Allan Herschell Company of North Tonawanda, New York. In 1883 herschell began producing carousels designed to endure <b>hard</b> <b>wear</b> and frequent travel. The horses were {{smaller and more}} compact than those made for permanent park carousels by such companies as Dentzel and the Philadelphia Toboggan Company heads and legs were tucked close to the bodies to minimize breakage and the machines could be easily taken apart, moved, and reassembled.|$|E
50|$|Cement {{addition}} makes a <b>harder</b> <b>wearing</b> {{paint in}} white or grey. Open time is short, {{so this is}} added at point of use. However, the use of cement restricts the breathable aspects of the limewash; cement should not be applied to historic buildings in general.|$|R
