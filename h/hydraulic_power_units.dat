50|$|The Brabazon was {{the first}} {{aircraft}} to be outfitted with 100 per cent powered flying controls; {{it was also the}} first to feature electric engine controls, and the first equipped with high-pressure hydraulics. The large span and mounting of the engines close inboard, together with structural weight economies, demanded some new measure to prevent bending of wing surfaces in turbulence. Thus, one of the innovative features of the Brabazon was a purpose-developed gust-alleviation system, which used an assortment of servos that were triggered from a gust-sensing probe installed on the exterior of the aircraft's nose; an improved version of this system, along with fully automated trimming, was to have been deployed on board the Brabazon Mark II. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>units</b> were also designed to operate the aircraft's giant control surfaces.|$|E

50|$|There {{were two}} self-contained, {{independent}} <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Units</b> (HPUs) on each SRB. Each HPU consisted of an {{auxiliary power unit}} (APU), fuel supply module, hydraulic pump, hydraulic reservoir and hydraulic fluid manifold assembly. The APUs were fueled by hydrazine and generated mechanical shaft power to drive a hydraulic pump that produced hydraulic pressure for the SRB hydraulic system. The two separate HPUs and two hydraulic systems were located on the aft end of each SRB between the SRB nozzle and aft skirt. The HPU components were mounted on the aft skirt between the rock and tilt actuators. The two systems operated from T minus 28 seconds until SRB separation from the orbiter and external tank. The two independent hydraulic systems were connected to the rock and tilt servoactuators.|$|E
50|$|Underwater {{thrusters}} can {{be divided}} in two main groups, hydraulic thrusters and electric thrusters. Electric thrusters are mainly used on battery operated underwater robots such as AUVs, submarines and electric ROVs. Hydraulic thrusters are mainly used on work class hydraulic ROVs. Hydraulic thruster technology is older than the electrical one, they are more rugged and their weight to thrust ratio is higher than electric thrusters, but maintenance and piping issues cause some dissatisfaction with users. Thanks to developing PMSM electric motors (wrongly knowing brushless DC Motor in market), electric thrusters are becoming more popular in newly designed products. Weight to thrust ratios are higher for hydraulic thrusters than for electric thrusters, but after {{taking into account the}} required hydraulic components including valves, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>units,</b> pipes joints, etc. hydraulic thruster systems come out heavier than electric thrusters.

There {{are a number}} of places where we've strengthened our engineering and our processes, says Mike Kahn, ATK Thiokol vice president of space launch systems. Protecting the booster against corrosion in the humid Florida environment is one area that has been addressed. Since the loss of Columbia, ATK Thiokol and the Marshall Space Flight Center have completely reevaluated the shuttle solid rocket motor's design certification and found no major problems, Kahn said. The Thiokol solid motors did not {{play a role in the}} 2003 Columbia accident, but the motor's older field joint design (since replaced) was the primary cause of the 1986 Challenger accident that killed seven astronauts. The 129 X 12 -ft. ATK Thiokol reusable solid rocket motor forms the core of the shuttle's two solid rocket boosters (SRBs). United Space Alliance (USA) has overall responsibility for the booster's nose-mounted systems such as recovery parachutes and aft-mounted thrust vector control systems that increase the length to 149 ft.

In {{the first part of the}} paper the actual circuit is described, and the main hypotheses adopted for the numerical modeling of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit,</b> of the control valves, of hydraulic pipes and of the actuators involved in the gear shift cycles are introduced. Particular attention is devoted to the actuators actual sequences, as applied by the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to the servo- valves deputed to actuators control. The strategy to define each gear shift cycle in terms of actuators working position in time domain is chosen, using the frequency map of each servo-valve. A numerical versus experimental comparison of the behavior of the actuators involved in the gear selection (during about 50 ms for an up shifting and 100 ms for a down shifting) is performed, with the target to define the validity limits of the numerical model results.

The test results for vibration and noise show that the design method is effective in significantly reducing the vibration and noise of the hydraulic station.
