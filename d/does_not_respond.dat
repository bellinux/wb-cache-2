Acidosis that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to administration of sodium bicarbonate may require further management with standard hemodialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration.|$|E
5|$|Heterozygous FH is {{normally}} treated with statins, bile acid sequestrants, or other lipid lowering agents that lower cholesterol levels. New cases are generally offered genetic counseling. Homozygous FH often <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to medical therapy and may require other treatments, including LDL apheresis (removal of LDL in a method similar to dialysis) and occasionally liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain. For those with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more than}} no treatment and about the same as medications, but it does not help with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be a reasonable method to try for those with chronic pain that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E

5|$|Relaxation techniques, such as exercise, yoga or meditation, may {{be useful}} in {{relieving}} the stress that may aggravate tics, but the majority of behavioral interventions (such as relaxation training and biofeedback, with the exception of habit reversal) have not been systematically evaluated and are not empirically supported therapies for Tourette's. Deep brain stimulation has been used to treat adults with severe Tourette's that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to conventional treatment, but it is regarded as an invasive, experimental procedure that is unlikely to become widespread.|$|E
5|$|The few {{contraindications}} {{to surgery}} include inoperable tumor, massive obesity, a particularly high-risk operation, or {{a desire to}} preserve fertility. These contraindications happen in about 5–10% of cases. Women who wish to preserve their fertility and have low-grade stage I cancer can be treated with progestins, with or without concurrent tamoxifen therapy. This therapy can be continued until the cancer <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to treatment or until childbearing is done. Uterine perforation may occur during a D or an endometrial biopsy. Side effects of surgery to remove endometrial cancer can specifically include sexual dysfunction, temporary incontinence, and lymphedema, along with more common side effects of any surgery, including constipation.|$|E
5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E

5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} uses social cues in its {{evaluation}} and choice of nesting sites. In particular, it listens to the post-breeding songs given out by other males. These songs have strong temporal dependencies. Males sing {{at the beginning and}} the peak of breeding season, but songs are not indicative of reproductive success. Near the end of a breeding season, a male that has successfully mated continues to sing while a male that has failed to reproduce abandons the habitat. Therefore, post-breeding songs are reliable indicators of reproductive success within the particular habitat and convey essential information to the natal and breeding dispersers. In comparison to the traditional idea of direct assessment of the vegetation structure, the vocal cue is much more efficient and easier to obtain, hence revealing the advantage of social communication in survival and reproduction. A female, however, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to post-breeding songs directly. Instead, she is likely to rely on the presence of males in deciding nesting sites.|$|E
5|$|With one day {{left before}} {{his meeting with}} Lipnick to discuss the movie, Barton phones Audrey and begs her for assistance. She visits him at the Earle, and after she admits that she wrote most of Mayhew's scripts, they {{apparently}} have sex; Barton later confesses to Charlie they did so. When Barton awakens the next morning, he, again, hears {{the sound of the}} mosquito, finds it on Audrey's back, and slaps it dead. When Audrey <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond,</b> Barton turns her onto her side only to find that she has been violently murdered. He has no memory of the night's events. Horrified, he summons Charlie and asks for help. Charlie is repulsed but disposes of the body and orders Barton to avoid contacting the police. After a meeting with an unusually supportive Lipnick, Barton tries writing again and is interrupted by Charlie, who announces he is going to New York for several days. Charlie leaves a package with Barton and asks him to watch it.|$|E
5|$|Bhairava {{then takes}} Mithra, his soldiers, and his caretakers to the Bhairavakona temple atop a cliff to seek blessings from God. Mithra demands Bhairava admit {{his love for}} her. When he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond,</b> she upsets the sacred items they have brought for the puja and, using her own blood, paints an image on a nearby rock of Bhairava leaving his true love to do his duty. An injured soldier arrives to tell Bhairava that Ranadev and Sher Khan's army have killed Vikram Singh and are now rushing toward them. They arrive shortly, and Sher Khan {{challenges}} Bhairava to battle his soldiers. Bhairava boldly accepts the challenge and kills a hundred soldiers, but is severely injured in the process. Sher Khan, impressed by Bhairava's bravery, has a change of heart. However, Ranadev continues attacking, eventually wounding Mithra fatally, but he is in turn killed by Bhairava. A dying Mithra asks Bhairava to confess his love, but before he can respond, she dies and falls off the cliff. Distraught, he follows her and falls to his own death.|$|E

5|$|P. schultzi <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to prey if {{the light}} is under 100lux (like a {{restaurant}} with only subdued artificial lighting), but responds to prey at distances from 6 to 10centimetres as the light level increases. A test suggested that P. schultzi′s hunting is stimulated only by vision, as prey close but hidden caused no response. A preliminary check showed that lures got the same responses from P. schultzi as live prey, and then more detailed testing with the lures showed that: if the target moved erratically, P. schultzi did not pursue it; if the target was totally stationary, the spider approached very slow (between 5 and 100millimetres per minute), with very long pauses in the final stages, and the sequence was not completed in 43% of cases; if the lure jiggled on the same spot, P. schultzi approached much faster and the sequence was almost always completed; if a lure was pulled directly away from P. schultzi, the spider followed, and faster if the lure was pulled, up to a limit (P. schultzi generally moves very slowly).|$|E
