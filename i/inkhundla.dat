5000|$|In Swaziland, an <b>inkhundla</b> (plural: tinkhundla) is an {{administrative}} subdivision {{smaller than a}} district but larger than an umphakatsi (or [...] "chiefdom"). [...] There are 55 tinkhundla in Swaziland: 14 in Hhohho District, 11 in Lubombo District, 16 in Manzini District, and 14 in Shishelweni District. According to the constitution of Swaziland, the government for Swaziland is a democratic, participatory, tinkhundla-based system that emphasizes devolution of state power from central government to tinkhundla areas and individual merit {{as a basis for}} election or appointment to public office. [...] The system is non-partisan since the constitution does not recognize political parties, although section 25 of the constitution allows for open freedom of assembly and association. Each <b>inkhundla</b> elects one representative to the House of Assembly of Swaziland, the lower chamber of the bicameral parliament (Libandla). [...] The same trend is applied in local government elections. This governing system was crafted by King Sobhuza II with the assistance of political scholars and lawyers. It came to effect in 1978 and was adjusted in the early 1990s to suit the desires of citizens.|$|E
50|$|The system {{emphasizes}} the devolution {{of state power}} from central government to Tinkhundla while individual merit is a basis for election and appointment into public office. In general, Tinkhundla stimulate community development at grassroots level, coordinating and promoting a good relationship between Government and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) working at the Tinkhundla level. They further provide a link between communities and government {{as well as other}} development agents to ensure the responsiveness of all national policies {{to the needs of the}} people.

In the Elections of 1999 the party opposed the country’s electoral system and boycotted the elections. Some members registered and participated in the elections. These were taken to a disciplinary hearing of which they were expelled.

50|$|Nominations {{take place}} at the chiefdoms. On the day of nomination, the name of the nominee is raised by a show of hand and the nominee is given an {{opportunity}} to indicate whether he or she accepts the nomination. If he or she accepts it, he or she must be supported by at least ten members of that chiefdom. The nominations are for the position of Member of Parliament, Constituency Headman (Indvuna) and the Constituency Executive Committee (Bucopho). The minimum number of nominees is four and the maximum is ten. Primary elections also {{take place at}} the chiefdom level. It is by secret ballot. During the Primary Elections, the voters are given an opportunity to elect the member of the executive committee (Bucopho) for that particular chiefdom. Aspiring Members of Parliament and the constituency Headman are also elected from each chiefdom. The secondary and final elections takes place at the various constituencies called Tinkhundla. Candidates who won primary elections in the chiefdoms are considered nominees for the secondary elections at <b>inkhundla</b> or constituency level. The nominees with majority votes become the winners and they become members of parliament or constituency headman.|$|E
50|$|Swazi {{culture is}} the way of life and customs of the Swazi people through various {{historical}} stages. The culture of Swazi people involves music, food, religion, architecture, kinship among many other things. The Swazi people are composed of various Nguni clans who speak the Nguni language SiSwati. These people mostly reside in Swaziland and South Africa. Presently, Swazi people may also include citizens of Swaziland. In Swaziland, one of the most visible features of cultural identity is the traditional political structure of the nation and the home. In the national level, the Ngwenyama is considered the head of the nation alongside the Ndlovukati who is the spiritual leader of the nation. National cultural events often involve the Ngwenyama or Ndlovukati. At home, the patriarch of the family is the head and in the past, often practiced polygamy. This headman, usually referred to as umnumzane is central to all activities of the home. A group of homes forming a community and the land they reside on forms a chiefdom or umphakatsi. Several chiefdoms form an <b>inkhundla</b> which then belongs of a regional division of the country. This connects the older traditional leadership structures to more modern forms of government.|$|E
40|$|This Research {{assesses the}} water supply systems for Lomahasha <b>Inkhundla,</b> located in the north eastern corner of Swaziland. The most {{favourable}} option was determined and its supply level was analysed considering other water demands in the same river basin. The project area is characterised by a history of repetitive drought occurrences and severe food shortages. The area includes Lomahasha ‘Town’ which is adjacent to the Mozambican city of Namaacha. For domestic water uses, the people in both Lomahasha and Namaacha generally rely on raw water from rivers and small dams, and during dry months, they travel long distances to reach the few perennial sources available. Swaziland Water Services Corporation (SWSC) attempted to develop a system to supply water to Lomahasha ‘Town’ by connecting to the existing system in Simunye, 30 km away. This proposal did not cater for the settlements along the 30 km pipeline route and other water deprived localities in the area. This research project was initiated to evaluate the SWSC proposal in comparison with other possible scenarios, and {{to find the most}} suitable option to supply water to the whole Lomahasha <b>Inkhundla,</b> including rural areas. The study was carried out by undertaking site investigations, discussions and interviews with stakeholders, monitoring of water flows and analysis of available documentation and relevant reports. The study concluded that the most economically and environmentally favourable option for the supply of water to Lomahasha <b>Inkhundla</b> was the option of connecting to the system in place at Simunye. This source was found to be adequate for the supply of water to Lomahasha <b>Inkhundla,</b> after its evaluation in conjunction with various scenarios of competing water uses in the same river basin...|$|E
40|$|This study {{uses the}} double-bounded {{willingness}} to pay (WTP) bid elicitation format to test whether the institution providing improved solid waste management (SWM) services in the Matsapha peri-urban area of Swaziland significantly influences households WTP. Matsapha was purposely selected on account of its well-documented human health and environmental impacts of poor SWM, arising {{from the lack of}} a proper SWM system. The WTP for improved SWM by households was thus elicited and compared when the service provider was an independent public agency (the Matsapha Town Council), a traditional community development agency (the Kwaluseni <b>Inkhundla),</b> and a private contractor. Purposive and simple random sampling methods were used to collect survey data from 180 households, using structured questionnaires and face-to-face interviews. Overall, households display a high level of knowledge about the risks associated with poorly managed household solid waste, and have attitudes and perceptions that are receptive to a policy that improves the current status of SWM. Mean WTP for improved SWM was highest when the service provider was the Matsapha Town Council (mean E 47. 71, with upper bound (UB) E 56. 29 and lower bound (LB) E 13. 33), followed by the private contractor (mean E 43. 71, with UB E 42. 50 and LB E 11. 67), and finally, the Kwaluseni <b>Inkhundla</b> (mean E 36. 49, with UB E 50. 83 and LB E 12. 14). Additional analysis showed that the mean WTP did not statistically differ when the SWM service was provided by the Matsapha Town Council or the private contractor (t = 1. 52, p = 0. 1331), which was unexpected, given that the latter is generally viewed as more efficient and cost effective. Mean WTP was, however, significantly higher when the service provider was the Matsapha Town Council, in comparison with the Kwaluseni <b>Inkhundla</b> (t = 4. 28, p = 0. 0001). Finally, the mean WTP was significantly higher when the service provider was the private contractor, in comparison with the Kwaluseni <b>Inkhundla</b> (t = 2. 90, p = 0. 0053). This allows us to conclude that the institution providing improved SWM services significantly influences households WTP, and that households rank the Matsapha Town Council as the most-preferred service provider. The study further established that in areas where SWM services are currently provided at a fee, households have a WTP for improved services that is much higher than current charges. For example, in areas where private collectors currently provide SWM services, households pay a monthly charge of E 30. 00, while our analysis shows they have a mean WTP of E 43. 71. The study additionally showed that in areas where no SWM services are currently provided, households {{would be willing to pay}} a positive monthly fee, if such services were to be provided. This allows us to conclude that the provision or improvement of SWM practices in the Matsapha peri-urban area of Swaziland, at a fee, would result in a Pareto improvement. Ordered Probit models, differentiated by SWM service provider as defined above, were used to determine the factors that influence households WTP for SWM services. The results, overall, show that households WTP significantly increases with the following variables: income, gender (e. g. WTP for females was significantly higher than for males), number of rental units in a compound, marital status (e. g. WTP for married people was significantly higher than for the singles) and number of tenants in a compound. On the other hand, WTP was found to significantly decrease with age, household size, attitude and perceptions of respondents. Following from the above, the study recommends that the Matsapha Town Council should consider improving the quality of SWM practices in areas where they are currently provided at a fee, and also consider providing such services in areas where they are not currently provided at a fee. Our analysis suggests that the Matsapha Town Council could levy a monthly fee that ranges between E 13. 33 and E 56. 29 per household. The actual value of the monthly fee should, however, be determined through a stakeholder engagement process.

40|$|Background: Fermentation is an age old {{technique}} of preserving food in many communities. A {{wide range of}} fermented products are prepared by varying the types of raw materials, utensils, and fermentation times. Several fermented foods are consumed in Swaziland. A survey {{of the types of}} fermented foods, preparation methods, and utensils used was done in the Hhohho region of Swaziland. The current study aimed at documenting the preparation methods of emahewu, emasi, umcombotsi, and buganu at household levels. Methods: Detailed fermentation steps were documented for umcombotsi, emahewu, buganu, and emasi. Five constituencies, called tinkhundla, were randomly selected from the 14 found in the Hhohho region of Swaziland. At each <b>inkhundla,</b> households that were known to regularly prepare the fermented foods were identified with the assistance of local community leaders and were interviewed. A semistructured questionnaire was used for the face-to-face interviews. Results: With respect to preparation procedures and practices, all respondents indicated that they had prepared different fermented foods at one time or another. The most commonly prepared and readily available fermented foods were umcombotsi (alcoholic beverage), emahewu (nonalcoholic beverage), buganu (marula wine), and emasi (spontaneously fermented milk). Both men and women indicated that they prepared umcombotsi, and only women reported that they prepared emahewu, buganu, and emasi. Umcombotsi was mainly prepared for sale, while buganu, emahewu, and emasi were for sale as well as for household consumption. Umcombotsi was mostly prepared by mixing maize meal, unmilled sorghum malt (magayiwe), and brown sugar (3  kg) in water (20  L). The initial stage involved cooking the mixture to gelatinize the starch, followed by fermentation at ambient temperature (25 – 30 °C) for about 72 hours. The whole preparation process takes about 4 – 5 days. Emahewu was prepared by mixing maize meal (1  kg) with water (5  L) and cooking to make a soft porridge. The cooled porridge was left to ferment at room temperature. Some reported adding sugar or a peeled potato to aid the fermentation process. Emasi was prepared by letting raw milk to naturally ferment at room temperature (25 – 30 °C) in either metal or plastic containers (buckets) for 2 – 3 days. Buganu was prepared from marula fruit (amaganu) juice and pulp mixed with water (10  L) and sugar (2  kg). The mixture was allowed to ferment at ambient temperature for about 3 days, sieved, and then served. Conclusion: Umcombotsi, emahewu, buganu, and emasi were the fermented foods commonly prepared at a household level in the Hhohho region, Swaziland. The main ingredient used for preparing umcombotsi and emahewu was maize meal. Unmilled sorghum malt was also added during preparation of umcombotsi. However, typically no malt was added during the preparation of emahewu. Buganu and emasi also {{play an important role in}} the diet and socioeconomic activities of the population in Swaziland...|$|E
