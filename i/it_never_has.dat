500|$|Lead singer Bart Millard has {{described}} the story behind [...] "So Long Self" [...] as [...] "...really simple: It’s Not About [...] <b>It</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> been and it never will be. Just like when maybe you had to break up with a girlfriend or a boyfriend growing up, or maybe {{the same thing happened}} to you, the ultimate breakup in life is when we breakup with ourselves. Because Christ said you have to die to self to follow him". The song is also lyrically about a break-up with sinful human nature.|$|E

500|$|The port's visuals {{were well}} received. Destructoid's Chris Carter {{felt that they}} [...] " [...] the neon and bright pastel veneer", and wrote that the [...] "new {{lighting}} effects and smoothed-out engine really allow the game to pop like <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> before". IGN's Justin Davis praised the updated character models, lighting, and textures, and Touch Arcade's Eric Ford noted that the [...] "visuals are improved {{but not in a}} drastic manner". NowGamer found that the mobile display improves the visual enjoyment of the game, despite the issues with the original game. Tom Hoggins of The Telegraph identified some issues with character models, but stated [...] "the city looks terrific".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in a 40th anniversary edition on 31 October 2011. The release {{contains}} a new stereo and 5.1 surround remix {{of the album}} by British musician and producer Steven Wilson, and comes in two different editions—a [...] "collector's edition" [...] containing the album on LP and two CDs, as well as DVD and Blu-ray discs and a hardback book; and a [...] "special edition" [...] containing the two CDs and an abridged version of the book. Justifying the remix, Steven Wilson said: [...] "Jethro Tull's Aqualung is... a masterpiece, but was sonically a very poor-sounding record. So, some didn't rate it as highly as they should have. What we did with Aqualung was really make that record gleam {{in a way it}} never gleamed before. I think a lot of people, including myself, have come around to thinking that the album is a lot better than they even gave it credit for previously. So, there is certainly something very gratifying about being able to polish what was already a diamond and making it shine in a way <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> before". Additionally, according to mastering engineer Steve Hoffman there were tape stretching problems with the original session mixdown master, implying that many editions of the album used multigeneration copies as their source.|$|E

Their job is to interpret what comes out of parliament, not to tell parliament how it goes about its functions." ...|$|E

He is shown black, blue or dark color, typically wearing reddish color clothes.

2500|$|On 14 February, Edwards' Vauxhall Cavalier {{received}} a parking ticket at the Severn View service station and on 17 February, the vehicle was reported as abandoned. Police discovered the battery to be flat, with {{evidence that the}} car had been lived in. Due to the service station's proximity to the Severn Bridge (which has been a renowned suicide location in the past) it was widely believed that he {{took his own life}} by jumping from the bridge. Many people who knew him, however, have said that he was never the type to contemplate suicide and he himself was quoted in 1994 as saying [...] "In terms of the 'S' word, that does not enter my mind. And <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> done, in terms of an attempt. Because I am stronger than that. I might be a weak person, but I can take pain." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{gospel of}} John was written to Christians in exile after the {{destruction}} of Jerusalem in AD 70 and the Gentile Johannine community. John does not use the term [...] "repentance" [...] even once in the book, although he {{was familiar with the}} term (see John 20:30-31 and Revelation Chapter 2 and 3). Zane Hodges and Bob Wilkin hold that repentance is defined as turning from one's sins, but repentance is not a requirement for eternal life, only faith in Christ. Hodges takes the position in Absolutely Free! (and in more detail in Harmony With God) that the process of repentance may be a preparatory step in coming to salvation, and should be evident {{in the life of a}} believer, but a lost man can be born again apart from repentance by any definition. Hodges also says that he no longer holds to the change of mind view of repentance. In Harmony with God, Hodges says that there is only one answer to the question “What must I do to be saved?” [...] “Repentance is not part of that answer. <b>It</b> <b>never</b> <b>has</b> been and never will be.” ...|$|E
