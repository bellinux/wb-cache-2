Thirteen months later, it is Father's Day and Adam tends to their son Jack (played variously by Joel Little and Dexter Little) in the night. Christine hears the Stranger's voice, but eventually finds Jack with Adam. Christine celebrates her birthday thirteen months later. Ernie no longer recognises Christine, while Adam <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in his colleague Zara (Ellerby). Marion blindfolds Christine {{for a game}} of blind man's buff. Christine hears noises from behind a door and removes her blindfold to step through. Thirteen months later, Adam is packing a case for a family holiday. Ernie has died, and Christine's relationship with Adam is strained.|$|E
5|$|John Chrysostom, deacon at Antioch from 381, {{was made}} priest in 386. As a special distinction, his bishop, Flavian, {{decided that he}} should preach in the city's {{principal}} church. Chrysostom's contribution to the literature on Philip and Christianity is a homily on Babylas, a martyr-bishop who died in 253, during the Decian persecution. The treatise was composed about 382, when John was a deacon, and forms part of Chrysostom's corpus of panegyrics. Chrysostom's Babylas confronts an emperor; and, since Chrysostom <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in the bishop than his opponent, the emperor goes unnamed. He has since been identified with Philip.|$|E

Catherine is {{pressured}} by Isabella and John into riding to Blaise Castle, despite her having made {{plans for a}} walk with Henry and Eleanor. John assures her that he saw Henry driving a phaeton to Wick Rocks, but while Catherine is in John's carriage, she sees the Tilneys walking along the street. Catherine asks John to stop, knowing he lied to her, but he refuses. Catherine runs into the Tilney family at the opera and makes her apologies, before planning another walk. John tells Henry's father, General Tilney (Liam Cunningham), that Catherine is the Allens' heir, and the General invites her {{to spend the day}} with the family. Catherine is delighted when she learns Henry and Eleanor love books as much as she does.|$|E
5|$|To impress Marge, Homer {{joins the}} debate team, of which Marge is a member. At a debate, Homer {{finds out that}} Marge <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in the more {{articulate}} Artie Ziff. Therefore, Homer pretends to be a French student {{so that he can}} be tutored by Marge and when Homer asks Marge to the senior prom she accepts. However, when Homer confesses that he is not really a French student, Marge is furious at him for making her lose sleep for a debate tournament the next morning. She ultimately loses to Artie, who asks her to be his partner to the prom; she agrees. Homer does not realize that Marge has changed her plans, and so he shows up at her house for prom night to pick her up. Moments later Artie shows up, causing confusion to Marge's family, and a despondent Homer leaves. Undaunted, he decides to go to the prom alone.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time later}} Susan finds David, {{who has just}} been jilted by Alice because of her, on a high {{platform}} at his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum. After showing him the missing bone which she'd found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur {{to be closer to}} him. She tells David that her Aunt has given her the million dollars, and she wants to donate it to the museum, but David <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in telling her that the day spent with her was the best day of his life. Unconsciously swaying the ladder from side to side upon hearing David's further words of endearment and love, Susan tells him that she loves him too, then notices that the ladder {{is on the verge of}} falling over. Frightened, she climbs onto and over the skeleton, but just before the dinosaur bones collapse David grabs her hand, she dangles below him, and he lifts her onto the platform. Regrettably surveying the wreckage of his work, David soon accepts the destruction and chaos, gives in, and hugs and kisses Susan.|$|E

25|$|The art of divination is {{generally}} employed {{for the purpose}} of obtaining information that can guide the adept in his Great Work. The underlying theory states that there exists intelligences (either outside of or inside the mind of the diviner) that can offer accurate information within certain limits using a language of symbols. Normally, divination within Magick {{is not the same as}} fortune telling, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in predicting future events. Rather, divination tends to be more about discovering information about the nature and condition of things that can help the magician gain insight and to make better decisions.|$|E

The revelations come at the same time when Deepak is being involved in a lawsuit against the government and governing party UMNO in a land deal case.

As his marriage begins to crumble, Francis pays the detective's troubled son to secretly follow his wife's daily whereabouts. The film is populated by characters and, as it is usual in his films, Téchiné <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in observing them closely rather than be driven by the plot.|$|E

40|$|Our {{research}} {{focused on}} the vocational interests correlated with the Dark Triad traits (i. e., narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism). By understanding how these traits facilitate the structuring of one’s environment, we hypothesized that psychopaths will <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in realistic and practical careers, narcissists will <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in artistic, enterprising, and social careers, and Machiavellians will <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in avoiding careers that involve caring for others. In two cross-sectional studies (N = 424; N = 274), we provide general support for these hypotheses. Overall, our study showed those high on the Dark Triad traits may structure their social environment through idealized career preferences. We also show that sex differences in career preferences might be a function, in part of, individual differences in the Dark Triad traits...|$|R

25|$|In the {{scientific}} method, parsimony is an epistemological, metaphysical or heuristic preference, not an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result. As a logical principle, Occam's razor would demand that scientists accept the simplest possible theoretical explanation for existing data. However, science has shown repeatedly that future data often support more complex theories than do existing data. Science prefers the simplest explanation {{that is consistent}} with the data available at a given time, but the simplest explanation may be ruled out as new data become available. That is, science is open to the possibility that future experiments might support more complex theories than demanded by current data and <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in designing experiments to discriminate between competing theories than favoring one theory over another based merely on philosophical principles.|$|E
25|$|One of Caragiale's {{main and}} {{earliest}} types {{is that of}} the young man gripped by love, expressing himself through emphatic and Romantic clichés—its main representative is O noapte furtunoasăs Rică Venturiano. As Vianu commented, Caragiale exploited the theme to so much success that it took another generation for youthful love to be presented in a non-comedic context (with the common signature writings of Ştefan Octavian Iosif and Dimitrie Anghel). At the other end are patriarchal figures, heads of families who seem unable or unwilling to investigate their wives' adulterous relations with younger men. This behavior is notably present in O noapte furtunoasă, where the aged Dumitrache fails to note even the most obvious signs that his wife Veta is in love with his good friend Chiriac. A more complex situation is present in O scrisoare pierdută, where political boss Trahanache cannot tell that his wife Joiţica is having an affair with Tipătescu, and, when confronted with the evidence, <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in proving that she is not.|$|E
25|$|The game then cuts to {{a cluster}} of villages near Forest Heart. As with the first game, {{the story is told}} through the journal entries of a soldier in The Legion, which is now led by Crüniac, who the {{soldiers}} think <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in politics than military matters, and spends its time on what the men perceive as trivial errands. Their latest assignment has them investigate reports of grave robbing, however, they are shocked to find the village of Willow Creek besieged by undead Ghasts. They clear the village, and learn the grave robbing leads to the keep of Baron Kildaer. They head to the keep and see hundreds of Thrall moving towards Tallow. Crüniac sends a runner to warn the villagers, while The Legion attack the keep. Crüniac proves a more skilled military tactician than his men believed, masterminding an attack which results in Kildaer's death. Soon thereafter, the runner returns with news that every village in the vicinity has been destroyed, and an undead army is amassing nearby. Crüniac sets fire to the Keep, and The Legion flee into the Clouspine Mountains.|$|E
50|$|Different {{people have}} {{different}} reactions to sexual {{content in the}} media. Men <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to <b>be</b> aroused by the sexual content than women. Gettleman argued that men are main consumers of sex videos, with an estimated 71 of sex videos consumed by men by themselves. It {{does not mean that}} men <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in sex videos than women. Women have been found to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in written and directed by women and for women, while men appear to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in seek out sexual media and be aroused by it. Malamuth and Check found that men, not women, were as aroused by a rape scene as by a consenting sex scene but only if the victim was portrayed as enjoying the rape and coming to orgasm. The men were not aroused if the victim was shown to be terrorized.|$|R
