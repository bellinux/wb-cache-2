50|$|On the Patiala - Sunam line, wooden {{sleepers}} 15 by 3 by 4 inches (380×75×100 mm) {{were initially}} used but were later replaced with <b>iron</b> <b>sleepers</b> due to termite infestation.|$|R
50|$|The {{track of}} PSMT was {{constructed}} by firm named Marsland and Price, who were based in Bombay. The track was 18 pound per yard (9 kg/m) rail clipped to <b>iron</b> <b>sleepers</b> 10 in by 8 in by ½ in (250×200×50 mm).|$|R
50|$|The {{next line}} was {{probably}} the one built on Blaafarveværket in the 1820s, by the German miner Karl Friedrich Böbert. This was a mine railway with its rails laid on cast <b>iron</b> <b>sleepers.</b> It was operated by horses and used to transport ore.|$|R
5000|$|The {{track was}} steel {{flat-bottomed}} rail of , attached by spring clips to cast <b>iron</b> <b>sleepers,</b> 3 ft long and 6.5 in wide, spaced at 2 ft centres. Pointwork was prepared at the workshop in Duffield (for which Heywood charged £7/15s/0d each (...) [...] ), and carried to site. The maximum gradient was 1 in 70 (1.43%), Eaton Hall being 51 ft above the sidings at Balderton.|$|R
500|$|Work on {{the line}} started in 1875 and the Stadtbahn was opened on 7 February 1882 for local traffic; it opened on 15 May the same year for long-distance trains. The costs of construction, {{including}} purchase of the land, were estimated at about 5 million Goldmark per kilometre. [...] The line would later become the core route of the Berlin S-Bahn. [...] The Stadtbahn was originally equipped with longitudinal <b>iron</b> <b>sleepers</b> on the Haarmann system, however these were replaced with wooden sleepers in the early 20th century.|$|R
5000|$|The {{gauge of}} the tramroads was 3ft 4in, {{and it was}} {{constructed}} of edge rails of a plain cross-section 2 inches wide at the head and [...] inches wide at the base, and three inches deep. The wagon wheels were double flanged, straddling the rail. Cast <b>iron</b> <b>sleepers</b> maintained the gauge, and these were supported on square wooden blocks laid on stone chippings. There were no passing places on the single line tramroads: empty wagons were manhandled off the track to allow loaded wagons to pass them.|$|R
5000|$|The precise {{reason why}} a track gauge of [...] (also known as [...] "Cape gauge") came to be {{selected}} remains uncertain. It could be because [...] {{was supposed to be}} cheaper to build than the internationally more widely used [...] "Stephenson gauge" [...] of , or because the first British agent, whose contract was later cancelled, ordered <b>iron</b> <b>sleepers</b> made for the narrower gauge. It seems most likely, however, that Morel's previous experience building Cape gauge railways in similar New Zealand terrain was a significant influence, and Cape gauge became the de facto standard.|$|R
50|$|The Emir Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca {{viewed the}} railway {{as a threat}} to Arab suzerainty, since it {{provided}} the Ottomans with easy access to their garrisons in Hejaz, Asir, and Yemen. From its outset, the railway was the target of attacks by local Arab tribes. These were never particularly successful, but neither were the Turks able to control areas more than a mile or so either side of the line. Due to the locals' habit of pulling up wooden sleepers to fuel their camp-fires, some sections of the track were laid on <b>iron</b> <b>sleepers.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} laid with MacDonnell's patent {{permanent}} way, consisting of bridge rails weighing 51 lbs and longitudinal rolled <b>iron</b> <b>sleepers</b> weighing 60 lbs to the lineal yard, which are secured {{to each other}} by screw bolts and nuts. The gauge is preserved by angle iron cross-ties, nine feet apart; and a strip of wood has been inserted between the rails and sleepers to prevent rigidity. This description of permanent way has been already tried on the Bristol & Exeter Railway, and with such success as to induce the Company to lay down an additional portion of it.|$|R
5000|$|GB Railfreight hauls raw {{materials}} and finished goods including gypsum, aggregates, limestone, <b>iron</b> ore, <b>sleepers,</b> ballast and rails. Its customers for this include Lafarge Tarmac, British Gypsum, Yeoman, Aggregate Industries, Network Rail and TfL ...|$|R
50|$|Prior to October 2012, {{the station}} had an island {{platform}} between the main lines, complete with original wooden station building and signal panel, and a suburban side platform to the west. It had a bowstring footbridge connecting the platforms, which dated {{from at least}} the 1930s, constructed of old railway <b>iron</b> and <b>sleepers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} A&GR {{track was}} formed with T-section rails of Birkinshaw's patent design; they were fishbellied with five webs to each 15 feet long rail, which weighed 28 to 30 lb/yd. The rail head was 2 inches across and the rail was 4 inches deep. They were malleable cast iron, {{except on the}} Soundwell branch where they were wrought <b>iron.</b> The <b>sleepers</b> were limestone blocks 18 inches square and ten to twelve inches deep, obtained from a quarry near the Keynsham Wharf, with chairs weighing 8 lb each, and an iron pin was used to secure the rails.|$|R
60|$|I requisitioned my uncle's best car forthwith. I {{went down}} {{that night to}} the place of {{despatch}} named on Nasmyth's telegram, Bampton S.O. Oxon, routed him out with a little trouble from that centre, made things right with him and got his explicit directions; and I was inspecting the Maud Mary with young Pollack, his cousin and aide, the following afternoon. She was rather a shock to me and not at all in my style, a beast of a brig inured to the potato trade, and she reeked from end to end with the faint, subtle smell of raw potatoes so that it prevailed even over the temporary smell of new paint. She was a beast of a brig, all hold and dirty framework, and they had ballasted her with old iron and old rails and <b>iron</b> <b>sleepers,</b> and got a miscellaneous lot of spades and iron wheelbarrows against the loading of the quap. I thought her over with Pollack, one of those tall blond young men who smoke pipes and don't help much, and then by myself, and as a result I did my best to sweep Gravesend clean of wheeling planks, and got in as much cord and small rope as I could for lashing. I had an idea we might need to run up a jetty. In addition to much ballast she held, remotely hidden in a sort of inadvertent way a certain number of ambiguous cases which I didn't examine, but which I gathered were a provision against the need of a trade.|$|R
50|$|An Act of Parliament to {{authorise}} the canal was obtained in March 1793, and allowed either {{the company or}} owners of collieries to build tramroads from the canal to points up to 8 mi from it. Although no work on the canal had started, the company began building the Clydach Tramway, with Dadford as engineer. It used edge rails, like modern railways, which were laid on <b>iron</b> <b>sleepers</b> initially, but then on wooden sleepers. It is difficult to be certain which sections Dadford was responsible for, with Hadfield describing a tramroad from Gelli-felen colliery to Gilwern, which then crossed the River Usk to reach Glanrwyney, where iron from Ebbw Vale was worked in a forge Skempton describes a 5.5 mi tramroad from Llangroiney to Gellifelen, and a second section from Gellifelen to Fossalog, near Nantyglo, while Gladwin and Gladwin describe a 1.4 mi route from Llammarch Colliery to Clydach Ironworks. Dadford's bridge over the Usk collapsed in February 1795, when the river was in flood, {{and the fact that}} he had not built flood relief culverts into the embankments on either side of the bridge was deemed to have been a contributory factor in its failure. In July 1794, he became the engineer for the Montgomeryshire Canal, which extended the Llanymynech Branch of the Ellesmere Canal from its terminus at Llanymynech to Newtown. It had been authorised in March 1794, and John was to be assisted by his brother Thomas. The route involved crossing the River Vyrnwy, where a five-arched aqueduct was built, each with a span of 39 ft, and crossing the River Rhiw at Berriew, where two 30 ft arches spanned the river, and there were two more arches on the land. One of the arches of the Vyrnwy aqueduct collapsed, and there were troubles with the Rhiw aqueduct. He resigned in July 1796 and emigrated to America. On his brother's suggestion, he was replaced by his father. The committee were critical of the Dadfords, but when they called in William Jessop to advise them, he suggested that such issues were merely teething problems, and were quite normal on such a project.|$|R
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended that the electrical {{supply to the}} line and stations would be provided by a dedicated generating station at St George's Road, Southwark. This idea was abandoned in 1902 and electricity was instead provided by Lots Road Power Station, operated by the UERL. Six ventilation fans were installed along the line to draw 18,500 cubic feet per minute through the tunnels and out through exhausts placed {{on the roof of}} the stations. Fresh air was drawn back down from the surface via the lift and staircase shafts, thus replenishing the air in the tunnels. To reduce the risk of fire, the station platforms were built of concrete and <b>iron</b> and the <b>sleepers</b> were made from the fireproof Australian wood Eucalyptus marginata or jarrah.|$|R
5000|$|A popular {{etymology}} deriving {{the term}} from {{the name of}} a Hind goddess, Amba Mata (a form of Durga riding a Tiger) has been proposed, supposedly via Hindu railway linesmen carrying loads of <b>iron</b> rails and <b>sleeper</b> blocks who would chant [...] "har, har Ambe!" [...] ("praise Amba") when working.The first president, Jomo Kenyatta has been said to have witnessed such a railway line team as it worked in cohesion and harmony and derived the term from there. This has led to criticism against the official use of the term on the part of Kenyan Christians. The actual etymology of the term is, however, cited as genuinely Bantu, from the Miji Kenda term halumbe [...] "to pull or push together". The objections have also been dismissed based on the that even if the supposed derivation were true, it has become irrelevant to the term's modern usage and meaning.|$|R
