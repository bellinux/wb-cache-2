25|$|And {{according}} to the testimony {{of some of his}} friends, such as Nicolas Fatio de Duillier or <b>David</b> <b>Gregory,</b> Newton thought that gravitation is based directly on divine influence.|$|E
50|$|As {{recounted in}} <b>David</b> <b>Gregory's</b> 2014 {{documentary}} Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau, the chaotic {{events of the}} making of the film quickly led to it becoming {{one of the most difficult}} and troubled productions in Hollywood history.|$|R

Her most recent releases are Throwndown and House of Manson, which made its world premier in 2014 at Twin Cities Film Festival. Her portrayal of Linda Kasabian in House of Manson earned her rave reviews on horror websites and blogs.|$|R
25|$|Among {{those who}} gave Newton {{corrections}} for the Second Edition were: Firmin Abauzit, Roger Cotes and <b>David</b> <b>Gregory.</b> However, Newton omitted acknowledgements to some {{because of the}} priority disputes. John Flamsteed, the Astronomer Royal, suffered this especially.|$|E
25|$|Goldberg has {{conducted}} interviews with President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, David Cameron, John Kerry, Benjamin Netanyahu, Isaac Herzog, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Ashton Carter, Ben Rhodes, Yair Lapid, Michael Oren, King Abdullah of Jordan, Ta-Nehisi Coates, <b>David</b> <b>Gregory,</b> and Tom Cotton, among others.|$|E
25|$|Goodwin is a {{frequent}} guest commentator on Meet the Press, appearing many times (during the tenures of hosts Tim Russert, Tom Brokaw, <b>David</b> <b>Gregory,</b> and Chuck Todd), {{as well as a}} regular guest on Charlie Rose, appearing a total of forty-eight times since 1994.|$|E
25|$|In March 2007, Ford {{joined the}} {{financial}} services firm Merrill Lynch as a vice chairman and senior policy adviser.

In March 2008, he moved from Fox to MSNBC as a news analyst, appearing as a panelist on <b>David</b> <b>Gregory's</b> Race for the White House, Hardball, and Morning Joe.|$|R
50|$|Disappointingly {{moved to}} a Friday night to {{accommodate}} a meaningless England v Saudi Arabia friendly match, the Play-Off Final with Torquay attracted just 19,486 with live TV coverage another factor. <b>David</b> <b>Gregory's</b> 22nd minute penalty was enough to fire U's back to the third tier after 17 years away. Once again the streets of Colchester thronged to an open-top bus parade.|$|R

25|$|The fifteenth Republican {{debate was}} hosted by NBC News and Facebook and {{was held in}} Concord, New Hampshire. It was moderated by <b>David</b> <b>Gregory.</b> Candidates in {{attendance}} were Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, and Jon Huntsman, Jr. in his final debate appearance.|$|E
25|$|In 1691, Gottfried Leibniz, Christiaan Huygens, and Johann Bernoulli derived the {{equation}} {{in response to}} a challenge by Jakob Bernoulli; their solutions were published in the Acta Eruditorum for June 1691. <b>David</b> <b>Gregory</b> wrote a treatise on the catenary in 1697 in which he provided an incorrect derivation of the correct differential equation.|$|E

25|$|WFAN and Westwood One {{also brought}} in outside personalities into the slot. Among them were Boomer Esiason, Patrick McEnroe, Geraldo Rivera, Lou Dobbs, and Chicago market sports radio host Mike North. As MSNBC also held its own {{claim to the}} slot, the cable network was able {{to have its own}} {{replacement}} shows simulcasted; these programs were hosted by in-house personalities <b>David</b> <b>Gregory,</b> Jim Cramer, and Joe Scarborough; eventually Scarborough would become the permanent replacement host on MSNBC with Morning Joe.|$|E
25|$|On April 11, 2007, Steve Capus of NBC News, {{announced}} that MSNBC {{would no longer}} simulcast Imus in the Morning, effective immediately. While the decision came {{on the same day}} that a few advertisers left Imus, the network also said employee concerns played a role. Sen. (and at the time presidential candidate) Barack Obama, and several high-profile NBC black personalities, including Al Roker previously a friendly guest on the show, opposed Imus's return. The absence and silence from Imus's frequent NBC guests Brian Williams, Andrea Mitchell, <b>David</b> <b>Gregory,</b> Chris Matthews and close friend Tim Russert was too obvious to ignore and foreshadowed NBC's future action.|$|E
25|$|MRC {{released}} a report in 2007 claiming that the network morning shows devoted more airtime to covering Democratic presidential candidates than Republican ones for the 2008 election. Producers for such shows criticized the MRC's methodology as flawed. During the 2008 US presidential election, MRC {{released a}} report that claimed {{that the vast majority}} of news stories about Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama had a positive slant. MRC president Bozell praised MSNBC for having <b>David</b> <b>Gregory</b> replace Chris Matthews and Keith Olbermann as political coverage anchor beginning September 8, 2008, but MSNBC president Phil Griffin disputed the statements by Bozell and others who have accused the network of liberal bias.|$|E
50|$|Another Perfect Stranger is a 2007 film {{sequel to}} the 2005 Christian film, The Perfect Stranger. It stars Jefferson Moore, (reprising his role as The Stranger) and Ruby Marie Lewis as Sarah Cominsky, the grown {{daughter}} of Nikki. It is followed by another sequel Nikki and the Perfect Stranger. It was based largely on <b>David</b> <b>Gregory's</b> novel, Day with a Perfect Stranger, with a few minor plot changes.|$|R

25|$|During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Olbermann co-anchored MSNBC's {{coverage}} with Chris Matthews until September 7, 2008, {{when they}} were replaced by <b>David</b> <b>Gregory</b> after complaints from both outside and inside of NBC that they were making partisan statements. This apparent conflict of interest had been an issue as early as May 2007, when Giuliani campaign officials complained about his serving in dual roles, as both a host and a commentator. Despite this, Countdown was broadcast {{both before and after}} each of the presidential and vice-presidential debates, and Olbermann and Matthews joined Gregory on MSNBC's Election Day coverage. Olbermann and Matthews also led MSNBC's coverage of the inauguration of President Barack Obama.|$|E
25|$|A {{sit down}} {{production}} {{played at the}} Princess of Wales Theatre in Toronto, Canada based on the 25th Anniversary touring production. Previews began on 27 September 2013 with the opening night on 9 October. The production closed on 2 February 2014. Co-directed by Lawrence Connor and James Powell, Laurence Olivier Award nominee, Ramin Karimloo, starred as Jean Valjean. He was joined by fellow West End star, Earl Carpenter, who reprised the role of Inspector Javert. Other cast members included Genevieve Leclerc as Fantine, Samantha Hill as Cosette, Melissa O'Neil as Éponine, Cliff Saunders as Monsieur Thenardier, Lisa Horner as Madame Thenardier, and Mark Uhre as Enjolras. The roles of young Cosette and young Éponine were shared by Ella Ballentine, Saara Chaudry and Madison Oldroyd. Gavroche was shared by <b>David</b> <b>Gregory</b> Black and Aiden GlennRead.|$|E

500|$|After {{being made}} habitable, the two {{families}} divided the house between them, with separate living rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchens. Corridors, stairs, and the old kitchen (which they termed the [...] "Eating Room") were shared communally. As {{a result of their}} leftist activism, they allowed meetings of both the British-Soviet Friendship Society, and the CPGB to take place in the house. They also permitted members of the Woodcraft Folk to camp in its grounds. In 1953, the inaugural meeting of the William Morris Society took place at the house, at which 45 people were present. In 1954, a third architect, <b>David</b> <b>Gregory</b> Jones, moved into the two rooms adjoining the downstairs gallery.|$|E
500|$|Two {{official}} residences {{have been}} provided for the astronomy professor. [...] The first was in New College Lane, in central Oxford. [...] John Wallis (geometry professor 1649–1703) rented a house there from New College from 1672 {{until his death in}} 1703; at some point, it was divided into two houses. [...] Towards the end of his life, <b>David</b> <b>Gregory</b> (astronomy professor 1691–1708) lived {{in the eastern part of}} the premises. [...] Wallis's son gave the unexpired portion of the lease to the university in 1704 in honour of his father's long tenure of the geometry chair, to provide official residences for the two Savilian professors. New College renewed the lease at a low rent from 1716 and thereafter at intervals until the last renewal in 1814. Records of who lived in each house are not available throughout the period, but surviving documentation shows that the professors often sub-let the houses and that for about twenty years in the early 18th century the premises were being used as a lodging house.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} his monologue, Colbert {{introduced}} what he {{characterized as}} an [...] "audition" [...] video to become the new White House Press Secretary—Scott McClellan had recently left the position. The video spliced clips of difficult questions from the White House press corps with responses from Colbert as Press Secretary. Colbert's podium included controls marked [...] "eject", [...] "Gannon" [...] (a reference to erstwhile White House reporter Jeff Gannon, who was suspected of asking planted questions), and [...] "volume", which he used to silence a critical question from journalist <b>David</b> <b>Gregory.</b> The video continued with Colbert fleeing the briefing room and the White House, only to be pursued by White House correspondent Helen Thomas, who had been a vocal critic of the Bush administration. At one point, Colbert picks up an emergency phone and explains that Thomas [...] "won't stop asking why we invaded Iraq". The dispatcher responds with, [...] "Hey, why did we invade Iraq?" [...] The entire second half of the video is a spoof of horror film clichés, particularly the film Westworld, with melodramatic music accompanying Thomas's slow, unwavering pursuit of Colbert, and Colbert loudly screaming [...] "No!" [...] at intervals. Widely available online, a portion of the mock audition tape aired on The Colbert Report on May 2, 2006.|$|E
5000|$|In 2017, {{she joined}} {{director}} James Kicklighter's Angel of Anywhere, with co-stars Ser'Darius Blain (Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle), <b>David</b> A. <b>Gregory,</b> and introducing Axel Roldos.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{mention of}} a series {{approximating}} Bode's law is found in <b>David</b> <b>Gregory's</b> The Elements of Astronomy, published in 1715. In it, he says, [...] "...supposing {{the distance of the}} Earth from the Sun to be divided into ten equal Parts, of these the distance of Mercury will be about four, of Venus seven, of Mars fifteen, of Jupiter fifty two, and that of Saturn ninety five." [...] A similar sentence, likely paraphrased from Gregory, appears in a work published by Christian Wolff in 1724.|$|R
