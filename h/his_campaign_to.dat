5|$|Suslov was {{becoming}} progressively {{more critical of}} Khrushchev's policies, his political intransigence, and <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> eliminate {{what was left of}} the old Stalinist guard. There were also deep-seated divergences in foreign and domestic policy between Suslov and Khrushchev. Suslov opposed the idea of improving Soviet Union–United States relations, and was against Khrushchev's attempts at rapprochement with Yugoslavia. Domestically, Suslov opposed Khrushchev's policy of de-Stalinisation and his economic decentralisation scheme.|$|E
5|$|In January 1874, Gladstone {{called a}} general election, {{convinced}} that if he waited longer, he would do worse at the polls. Balloting was spread over two weeks, beginning on 1 February. Disraeli devoted much of <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> decrying the Liberal programme {{of the past five}} years. As the constituencies voted, {{it became clear that the}} result would be a Conservative majority, the first since 1841. In Scotland, where the Conservatives were perennially weak, they increased from seven seats to nineteen. Overall, they won 350 seats to 245 for the Liberals and 57 for the Irish Home Rule League. The Queen sent for Disraeli, and he became Prime Minister for the second time.|$|E
25|$|Despite its decline, in 1265 {{the castle}} was {{committed}} to Prince Edward, later Edward I (reigned 1272–1307), who held court there in 1275 and 1280. In 1295, hostages from <b>his</b> <b>campaigns</b> <b>to</b> subjugate Wales were held at the castle.|$|R

However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was {{the signing of}} Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona. The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro. It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed {{to win a major}} trophy for the next three seasons.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008 general election, Gibbs faced Republican Don Ytterberg, {{whom he had}} outraised roughly $80,000 to $50,000 by mid-October. Gibbs cited his {{track record}} of passing {{legislation}} and his connections and experience {{at the state capitol}} as part of his case for re-election, and named wildfire and business concerns as his major priorities for a continued term in the Colorado Senate. He also called for reducing business personal property taxes and growing local small businesses. Gibbs' re-election bid was endorsed by the Denver Post, the Summit Daily News, and the Boulder Daily Camera, the Arvada Press, and the Golden Transcript. Gibbs raised over $100,000 during <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> Ytterberg's $60,000, and ultimately won re-election with about 59 percent of the vote, taking three-quarters of votes cast in Summit County, but losing narrowly to Ytterberg in suburban Jefferson County.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Patton faced Republican Eugene Goss. Goss criticized Patton for announcing that, if elected, he would seek the governor's {{office at the}} {{expiration}} of his term. Goss insisted {{that he would not}} seek the governorship if elected, and maintained that using the lieutenant governor's post as a stepping stone to the governor's office was a betrayal of the office and its authority. Goss ran an unorthodox campaign, limiting individual contributions to <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> $300 and refusing to run television commercials. Patton went on to a lopsided victory in the general election, winning 514,023votes to Goss's 250,857.|$|E

5|$|It {{was during}} this time that Berenice met {{and fell in love}} with Titus, who was eleven years her junior. The Herodians sided with the Flavians during the conflict, and later in 69, the Year of the Four Emperorswhen the Roman Empire saw the quick {{succession}} of the emperors Galba, Otho and VitelliusBerenice reportedly used all her wealth and influence to support Vespasian on <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> become emperor. When Vespasian was declared emperor on 21 December 69, Titus was left in Judaea to finish putting down the rebellion. The war ended in 70 with the destruction of the Second Temple and the sack of Jerusalem, with approximately 1 million dead, and 97,000 taken captive by the Romans. Triumphant, Titus returned to Rome to assist his father in the government, while Berenice stayed behind in Judaea.|$|E
5|$|Twenty years later, in 1930, Governor Huey Long would {{rail against}} this loss {{when he ran}} for the office of U.S. Senator against {{incumbent}} Joseph E. Ransdell. In a circular distributed by <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> the citizens of New Orleans, Long listed the loss of the Mint as the very first of many complaints against Ransdell's lengthy service record in the Senate. Long {{went on to win the}} election, although he did not take office until his term as governor expired in 1932. At some point, however, the original New Orleans machinery was lost, and, at present, has not been located.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{was joined}} at Barnet by his brothers, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and George, Duke of Clarence. Unlike his eldest brother, Gloucester was slender and {{seemingly}} delicate. He was 18 {{years old at}} the Battle of Barnet, his first major engagement. His military prowess, however, was well respected; many historians judge him a capable warrior and military leader. Clarence was not as well regarded as his brothers, especially in matters of loyalty. When Edward became king, Clarence was chosen as his heir; however, the births of Elizabeth of York (1466) and Edward V (1470) displaced the Duke in the line of succession to the throne. Hence, Clarence participated in Warwick's schemes, marrying the Earl's daughter Isabella, believing he could gain his brother's throne. Clarence lost faith in the Earl when Warwick defected to the Lancastrians and married off his other daughter, Anne, to their prince in order to cement his new allegiance. When Edward launched <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> retake England, Clarence accepted his brother's offer of pardon and rejoined the Yorkists at Coventry on 2 April 1471. The last of the Yorkist commanders was William, Lord Hastings, a loyal subject {{since the start of the}} wars. Hastings had accompanied the young king in exile and supported his return. The courtier was rewarded for his faithfulness, gaining the lieutenancy of Calais in 1471 and becoming Edward's lord chamberlain and primary confidant.|$|E

5|$|From Ancyra, the Abbasid army {{turned to}} Amorium, {{to which they}} laid siege on 1 August. Al-Afshin, Itakh, and Ashinas all took turns assaulting the city with their troops, but the siege was {{fiercely}} contested, even after the Abbasids, informed by a defector, effected a breach in a weak spot of the wall. After two weeks, however, {{taking advantage of a}} short truce for negotiations requested by one of the Byzantine commanders of the breach, the Abbasid army stormed the city. The city was thoroughly plundered and its walls razed, while the populace, numbering into the tens of thousands, was carried off to be sold into slavery. According to al-Tabari, al-Mu'tasim now pondered extending <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> attack Constantinople, when the conspiracy headed by his nephew, al-Abbas, was uncovered. Al-Mu'tasim was forced to cut short his campaign and return quickly to his realm, without bothering with Theophilos and his forces, encamped in nearby Dorylaion. Taking the direct route from Amorium to the Cilician Gates, both the caliph's army and its prisoners suffered in the march through the arid countryside of central Anatolia. Some captives were so exhausted that they could not move and were executed, whereupon others found the opportunity to escape. In retaliation, al-Mu'tasim, after separating the most prominent among them, executed the rest, some 6,000 in number.|$|E
5|$|Gower {{continued}} to see extensive {{fighting in the}} 13th century. Loughor Castle was given by King John to his ally William de Braose in 1203; William was a powerful Marcher Lord, and related to Rhys ap Gruffudd and his extended family. In 1208, however, John and William argued; their relationship broke down and the king attempted to confiscate Loughor and William's other lands in the region. William allied himself with the Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great and war broke out. William died in 1211, but his son, Reginald, continued fighting and married Gwladus, Llywelyn's daughter. In 1215, the castle was captured by Llywelyn's forces and control of Gower was granted to Reginald. Two years later, however, Reginald made peace with the English Crown and Llywelyn removed him from power, replacing him with the Welsh prince Rhys Gryg. Contemporary chroniclers recorded that Rhys Gryg deliberately destroyed all the castles in Gower as part of <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> dominate the area.|$|E
5|$|Haifa {{has over}} a dozen museums. The most popular museum is the Israel National Museum of Science, Technology, and Space, which {{recorded}} almost 150,000visitors in 2004.

The Haifa Museum of Art houses a collection of modern and classical art, as well as displays on the history of Haifa. The Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art is the only museum in the Middle East dedicated solely to Japanese art. Other museums in Haifa include the Museum of Prehistory, the National Maritime Museum and Haifa City Museum, the Hecht Museum, the Dagon Archaeological Museum of Grain Handling, the Railway Museum, the Clandestine Immigration and Navy Museum, the Israeli Oil Industry Museum, and Chagall Artists' House.

5|$|Henry {{lost control}} {{of power in the}} 1260s, {{resulting}} in the Second Barons' War across England. Following the Royalist defeat in 1264, the rebel leader Simon de Montfort seized Ludlow Castle, but it was recaptured shortly afterwards by Henry's supporters, probably led by Geoffrey de Geneville. Prince Edward escaped from captivity in 1265 and met up with his supporters at the castle, before commencing <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> retake the throne, culminating in de Montfort's defeat at Evesham later that year. Geoffrey continued to occupy the castle {{for the rest of the}} century under Edward I's rule, prospering until his death in 1314. Geoffrey built the Great Hall and the Solar block during his tenure of the castle, either between 1250 and 1280, or later, in the 1280s and 1290s. The town walls of Ludlow also began to be constructed in the 13th century, probably from 1260 onwards, and these were linked to the castle to form a continuous ring of defences around the town.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} sack, rumours reached the caliph that Theophilos was {{advancing}} to attack him.

According to al-Tabari, Mu'tasim now pondered extending <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> attack Constantinople, when news reached him of a conspiracy headed by his nephew, al-Abbas ibn al-Ma'mun. Mu'tasim was forced to cut short his campaign and return quickly to his realm, leaving intact the fortresses around Amorium as well as Theophilos and his army in Dorylaion. Taking the direct route from Amorium to the Cilician Gates, both the caliph's army and its prisoners suffered in the march through the arid countryside of central Anatolia. Some captives were so exhausted that they could not move and were executed, whereupon others found the opportunity to escape.

5|$|In April 1998, Wooller {{claimed that}} the council of the ICAEW was obstructing <b>his</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} democracy after it refused to allow the original text of motions that were to be published to be heard at the annual general meeting in June 1998. Wooller's first motion was about electing {{the president of the}} ICAEW democratically by ballot. The other two motions came about from the Gerrard report. The second motion said the district societies should be self-financing and the third motion was on reducing the number of council members to fifty-three. The first motion used a quotation from an Accountancy Age interview with council member Ian Hay Davison, and Wooller was told to stop circulating Hay Davison's quotation after he objected to being quoted. The ICAEW asked members to vote on {{an increase in the number}} of council members from seventy-five after requests made in the Gerrard report. Wooller asked members to reduce the number of council members to fifty-three, which was recommended by the Gerrard report as the ideal council quota. A 54% majority of the ICAEW members supported Wooller's motion to reduce the number.|$|E
