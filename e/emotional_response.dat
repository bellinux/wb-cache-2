Twenty-seven minutes into the match, Del Piero picked the ball up {{at the edge of the}} penalty box and placed a shot past Giorgio Frezzolini to make the score 2–0, helping Juventus to go undefeated in Serie A that season. He was substituted off after 59 minutes to an <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> from both sets of players and supporters, as he made a lap of honour around the pitch. This was Alessandro Del Piero's final Serie A appearance for Juventus.|$|E

40|$|Coffee {{and green}} tea are popular {{beverages}} consumed at both {{hot and cold}} temperatures. When people consume hot beverages concurrently with other activities, they may experience at different temperatures over the period of consumption. However, there has been limited research investigating the effects of product temperatures on <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> and sensory attributes of beverages. This study aimed to determine whether <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> to, and sensory attributes of, brewed coffee and green tea vary {{as a function of}} sample temperature. Using a check-all-that-apply (CATA) method, 157 participants (79 for coffee and 78 for green tea) were asked to evaluate either coffee or green tea samples served at cold (5 °C), ambient (25 °C), and hot (65 °C) temperatures with respect to <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> and sensory attributes. The results showed that sample temperature could have significant influences on <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> to, and sensory attributes of, coffee and green tea samples. More specifically, 6 and 18 sensory attributes of coffee and green tea samples, respectively, significantly differed with sample temperature. Beverage samples evaluated at 65 °C were characterized, regardless of activation/arousal level, by positive <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> terms and favorable sensory attributes. While beverages evaluated at 25 °C were associated more with negative <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> with low activation/arousal, those evaluated at 5 °C were more frequently characterized as having negative <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> with high activation/arousal. Sensory and emotional drivers of liking for both coffee and green tea differed both with sample temperature and gender. While both <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> and sensory attributes were identified as drivers of liking among females, only <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> were identified as drivers of liking among males. In conclusion, this study provides empirical evidence that both <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> to, and sensory attributes of, coffee and green tea beverages can vary with sample temperatures. To provide a better understanding of product characteristics, <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> to, and sensory attributes of, coffee or green tea beverages should be tested over a wider range of product temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} endeavours {{to investigate}} the nature {{and the extent of}} the <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> elicited to same colour, and music under two different outside environment temperatures called hot and mild. To analyse the <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> elicited to colour and music under hot and mild outside environment temperatures, data were collected from two clusters of sample where each consisted of 50 respondents. One cluster of sample represented customers of a supermarket where its outside environment temperature is hot and other cluster of the sample consisted of customers of a supermarket where its outside environment temperature is mild. The study found that when outside environment temperature changes, customers exhibit different <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> to same colour, and music. It was found that a warm colour, red produces positive emo-tional responses under mild outside environment temperature while in contrast, the same colour produces negative <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> under hot outside environment temperature. Moreover, it was recognized that fast-tempo music is capable of evoking positive <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> under mild outside environment temperature whilst evoking negative <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> under hot outside environment temperature. Ul-timately, the results proved that the extent {{and the nature of the}} <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> elicited to same co-lour, and music are different between hot outside environment temperature and mild outside environmen...|$|R

5|$|The TuđmanĆosić {{agreement}} on the pullout of JNA troops from Konavle provoked an <b>emotional</b> <b>response</b> in Yugoslavia, where it was interpreted as a defeat and betrayal. Following the agreement, the Prevlaka Peninsula was demilitarized and placed under the United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP), established by the UN Security Council Resolution 779 of 6 October 1992. The resolution placed the peninsula {{under the control of}} UNPROFOR. The UN Security Council Resolution 981 transferred control to the newly established United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia on 31 March 1995, and then to UNMOP through the UN Security Council Resolution 1038 of 15 January 1996. The UN mission there expired two months later. , the Prevlaka Peninsula remains demilitarized, with Croatian and Montenegrin police jointly patrolling the sea.

40|$|Background This study {{sought to}} gather {{information}} {{about the impact of}} extended training in positive behaviour support on staff knowledge, causal attributions and <b>emotional</b> <b>responses.</b> Methods Students completed questionnaires at the beginning, middle and end of a University Diploma course to measure changes in their knowledge of challenging behaviour, their causal attributions and their <b>emotional</b> <b>responses.</b> Results Students' knowledge significantly increased across the three data points. Students became less likely to attribute challenging behaviour to emotional causes. Changes in respect of making more behavioural attributions varied across different measures. Negative <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> reduced especially those related to depression/anger. Conclusions The training course presented here was associated with changes in student knowledge, attributions and <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> that are likely to be associated with better staff performance and better outcomes for people with intellectual disabilities. ...|$|R

40|$|Watching news is {{important}} for preadolescents, {{but it may also}} harm their well-being. This study examined whether applying insights from positive psychology to news production can reduce this potential harm, by reducing negative <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> and enhancing positive <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> to negative news, and by encouraging prosocial intentions. Moreover, we explored whether peer discussion strengthened these effects. Preadolescents (n = 336; 9 - 13 years old; 48. 5 % female) were exposed to either constructive (solution-based news including positive emotions) or nonconstructive news. Subsequently, half of the children assigned to the constructive and the nonconstructive condition participated in a peer discussion. The findings showed that exposure to constructive news resulted in more positive <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> and less negative <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> as compared to nonconstructive news. Moreover, discussing the news with peers led to more positive and less negative <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> among preadolescents who watched the nonconstructive newscast, and to more prosocial intentions among preadolescents who watched constructive news. In all, constructive news reporting and peer discussion could function as tools to make negative news less harmful for preadolescents...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the impact of {{personality}} traits on <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> to interpersonal stress. Methods: Thirty-two healthy college students (18 men, 14 women; age 25. 2 ± 2. 7 years) participated in the study. Mood and anxiety were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. Personality traits were assessed with the Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure (IPSM). The subjective <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> of participants to different (i. e., negative, neutral, and positive) interpersonal feedback were measured. Results: Subject responses were positive to positive interpersonal feedback and negative to negative interpersonal feedback. The IPSM fragile inner self subscore was negatively correlated with the subjective <b>emotional</b> ratings in <b>response</b> to interpersonal feedback. No correlation was found between validation measures (i. e., the degree of attention in the task and task difficulty) and subjective <b>emotional</b> <b>responses.</b> Conclusion: Taken together, <b>emotional</b> <b>responses</b> to interpersonal stress may be modulated by personality traits and may impact health and psychological outcomes.
