Private banks and governments across the world followed Gresham's Law: keeping gold and silver paid, but paying out in notes. This did not <b>happen</b> <b>all</b> around {{the world at the}} same time, but occurred sporadically, generally in times of war or financial crisis, beginning {{in the early part of}} the 20th century and continuing across the world until the late 20th century, when the regime of floating fiat currencies came into force. One of the last countries to break away from the gold standard was the United States in 1971.|$|E

25|$|Limited risk of catastrophically large losses: Insurable {{losses are}} ideally {{independent}} and non-catastrophic, {{meaning that the}} losses do not <b>happen</b> <b>all</b> at once and individual losses are not severe enough to bankrupt the insurer; insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base. Capital constrains insurers' ability to sell earthquake insurance as well as wind insurance in hurricane zones. In the United States, flood risk is insured by the federal government. In commercial fire insurance, {{it is possible to}} find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurer's capital constraint. Such properties are generally shared among several insurers, or are insured by a single insurer who syndicates the risk into the reinsurance market.|$|E
