5|$|Next, the {{examining}} physician may check for {{weakness of the}} quadriceps. This examination may reveal fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The Wilson test is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the femoral condyle. The test is performed by slowly extending the knee from 90 degrees, maintaining internal rotation. Pain at 30 degrees of <b>flexion</b> and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of OCD.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main muscle {{groups of the}} forelimb. The triceps muscle {{straightens}} the elbow and foreleg, running from the elbow {{to the bottom of}} the shoulder blade. The muscles which extend the lower leg are called extensor muscles, while the <b>flexion</b> of the lower leg joints is achieved through movement of the flexor muscles. There are five main muscles and muscle groups in the hind legs. The vastus muscle flexes the hind leg and runs from stifle to hip, while the gluteal muscles, the large muscles in the hip, extend the femur. Forward motion and <b>flexion</b> of the hind legs is achieved through the movement of the quadriceps group of muscles on the front of the femur, while the muscles at the back of the hindquarters, called the hamstring group, provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs. Extension of the hock is achieved by the Achilles tendon, located above the hock.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{investigate}} {{the potential of}} constraining the mass to light ratio of field galaxies using weak lensing shear and <b>flexions.</b> A suite of Monte Carlo simulations are used to generate weak lensing observations with different noise models. Using mock data, {{we find that the}} inclusion of <b>flexions</b> can improve the estimate of foreground halo parameters, but the details are strongly dependent on noise in the model. In the intrinsic noise limit, both shear and <b>flexions</b> are promising tools to study the mass to light ratio of galaxies. However, if the noise model of <b>flexions</b> follows the form described by Rowe et al., there is only ∼ 5 % improvement in the constraints even with next generation lensing observations.

5|$|In general, {{motion is}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} anatomical plane it occurs in. <b>Flexion</b> and extension are examples of angular motions, in which two axes of a joint are brought closer together or moved further apart. Rotational motion may occur at other joints, for example the shoulder, and are described as internal or external. Other terms, such as elevation and depression, describe movement above or below the horizontal plane. Many anatomical terms derive from Latin terms with the same meaning.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the {{swelling of the}} area around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling. The area of swelling may be red (erythema), warm to the touch, or surrounded by cellulitis, particularly if the area has become infected. In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it may cause some discomfort when the knee is completely flexed. <b>Flexion</b> and extension of the knee may cause crepitus.|$|E
5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Jack Bailey (1997), the spines resembled those of sail-bearing pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon. According to Bailey, Amargasaurus might also have possessed such a sail, {{which might have been}} used for display. Unlike those of pelycosaurs, the neural spines of Amargasaurus were bifurcated, forming a double row along the neck and back. As the space between both rows was merely , the {{existence}} of two parallel sails seems unlikely. Instead, Bailey suggested the spines represented a scaffold which was completely enveloped by a single skin. Paul argued against the sail hypothesis, noting that neck sails would have reduced neck <b>flexion,</b> and that the spines were circular in cross-section rather than flattened {{as is the case in}} sail-bearing animals.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was two-fold. Firstly we wanted to {{quantify}} the relationship of isokinetic muscle strength (IMS) and long jump performance (LJP) in young jumpers, and secondly to compare males and females in IMS. Our measurements in 7 males and 7 females showed that the LJP was correlated with the normalized peak joint moment of the concentric knee extensions and the concentric ankle plantar <b>flexions.</b> A low correlation was observed between the LJP and the eccentric knee extensions. The t-test showed significant gender differences in joint peak moment of concentric knee extensions and in normalized peak joint moment of concentric plantar <b>flexions</b> and eccentric plantar <b>flexions</b> at 120 deg/sec. Although, our findings suggest that IMS is a major contributor to LJP, it is suggested that training intervention should not be based exclusively on isokinetic tests because of the differences in musculoskeletal function between the two movements...|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} support the robust head, the neck of Hatzegopteryx was likely {{strongly}} muscled. On the occipital bones, the nuchal lines, which serve as muscular attachments, are very well-developed and bear prominent scars. These conceivably supported the transversospinalis muscles, which aid in extension and <b>flexion</b> {{of the head and}} neck. Likewise, the opisthotic process, neural spines, and zygapophyses all appeared to have been large and robust (with the latter bearing many pits and edges that likely represent muscle scars), and the basioccipital tuberosities were long; these all serve as points of attachment for various muscles of the head and neck. Although not entirely unmuscled, the neck of Arambourgiania probably would not have been as extensively muscled as that of Hatzegopteryx.|$|E
5|$|Perforator veins play a {{very special}} role in the venous system, {{carrying}} blood from superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paraná maneuver, toe and foot <b>flexion,</b> and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E
5|$|The median plates (m, m') {{are also}} sclerites {{that are not}} so {{definitely}} differentiated as specific plates as are the three principal axillaries, but nevertheless they are important elements of the flexor apparatus. They lie in the median area of the wing base distal to {{the second and third}} axillaries and are separated from each other by an oblique line (bf) which forms a prominent convex fold during <b>flexion</b> of the wing. The proximal plate (m) is usually attached to the distal arm of the third axillary and perhaps should be regarded {{as a part of the}} latter. The distal plate (m') is less constantly present as a distinct sclerite and may be represented by a general sclerotization of the base of the mediocubital field of the wing. When the veins of this region are distinct at their bases, they are associated with the outer median plate.|$|E

40|$|Classification {{of surface}} {{electromyogram}} (sEMG) signal {{is important for}} various applications such as prosthetic control and human computer interface. Surface EMG provides a better insight into the strength of muscle contraction {{which can be used}} as control signal for different applications. Due to the various interference between different muscle activities, it is difficult to identify movements using sEMG during low-level <b>flexions.</b> A new set of fractal features - fractal dimension and Maximum fractal length of sEMG has been previously reported by the authors. These features measure the complexity and strength of the muscle contraction during the low-level finger <b>flexions.</b> In order to classify and identify the low-level finger <b>flexions</b> using these features based on the fractal properties, a recently developed machine learning based classifier, Twin Support vector machines (TSVM) has been proposed. TSVM works on basic learning methodology and solves the classification tasks as two SVMs for each classes.

40|$|This {{research}} paper reports an experimental study on {{identification of the}} changes in fractal properties of surface Electromyogram (sEMG) with the changes in the force levels during low-level finger <b>flexions.</b> In the previous study, the authors have identified a novel fractal feature, Maximum fractal length (MFL) as a measure of strength of low-level contractions and has used this feature to identify various wrist and finger movements. This study has tested the relationship between the MFL and force of contraction. The results suggest that changes in MFL is correlated with the changes in contraction levels (20 %, 50 % and 80 % maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)) during low-level muscle activation such as finger <b>flexions.</b> From the statistical analysis and by visualisation using box-plot, it is observed that MFL (p ≈ 0. 001) is a more correlated to force of contraction compared to RMS (p ≈ 0. 05), even when the muscle contraction is less than 50 % MVC during low-level finger <b>flexions.</b> This work has established that this fractal feature will be useful in providing information about changes in levels of force during low-level finger movements for prosthetic control or human computer interface...|$|R
5|$|The third {{axillary}} sclerite (3Ax) lies in {{the posterior}} part of the articular region of the wing. Its form is highly variable and often irregular, but the third axillary is the sclerite on which is inserted the flexor muscle of the wing (D). Mesally it articulates anteriorly (f) with the posterior {{end of the second}} axillary, and posteriorly (b) with the posterior wing process of the tergum (PNP), or with a small fourth axillary when the latter is present. Distally the third axillary is prolonged in a process which is always associated with the bases of the group of veins in the anal region of the wing here termed the vannal veins (V). The third axillary, therefore, is usually the posterior hinge plate of the wing base and is the active sclerite of the flexor mechanism, which directly manipulates the vannal veins. The contraction of the flexor muscle (D) revolves the third axillary on its mesal articulations (b, f) and thereby lifts its distal arm; this movement produces the <b>flexion</b> of the wing. The Fourth Axillary sclerite is not a constant element of the wing base. When present it is usually a small plate intervening between the third axillary and the posterior notal wing process and is probably a detached piece of the latter.|$|E

To use HRT in the assessment of individuals with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), its ability to detect differences in the functional performance of patients with PAOD must be verified. Aim: To verify whether the test is sensitive in differentiating between individuals with PAOD with distinct functional capacities. Materials and methods: A transversal study in which individuals with PAOD were assessed using the HRT, the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), and the Shuttle Walk Test. The following variables were analyzed: number of plantar <b>flexions</b> performed in the HRT (time in seconds) and velocity (plantar <b>flexions</b> per second) when performing plantar <b>flexions</b> up to the point of volunteer fatigue, maximum distance walked in the Shuttle Walk Test, and scores obtained in each WIQ domain. Results: Twenty-five individuals (14 male) were included in the study, {{with a mean age of}} 63. 36 &plusmn; 9. 83 years. The variables number of plantar <b>flexions</b> and time to perform the HRT were sensitive enough to differentiate between distinct functional capacities in individuals with PAOD (P = 0. 003 and P = 0. 009, respectively). However, this result was not found for the variable of velocity in the HRT. The number of plantar <b>flexions</b> in the HRT was sensitive enough to differentiate individuals of extreme classes on the WIQ domain, stairs (P = 0. 008). Conclusion: The HRT can be applied in clinical practice as a valid assessment of the distinct function capacities of individuals with PAOD.

While recent work {{has focused on}} multimodal signals, the production, processing and evolution of multi-component signals has received considerably less attention. Here, using synchronous high-speed video and laser vibrometer recordings followed by experimental manipulations of putative sound-producing structures, we explored the mechanisms of seismic signal production in the courtship display of Schizocosa stridulans Stratton. Two types of seismic courtship signals were observed: ‘rev’ and ‘idle’ signals. Revs consist of a high-frequency component produced by <b>flexions</b> of the male pedipalp (stridulation) simultaneous with a low frequency component produced by movements of the abdomen (tremulation). This multi-component signal is produced by independent structures and represents a parallel multi-component display. By contrast, idle displays consist of a high-intensity component produced by drumming of the forelegs on the substrate (percussion) followed by a high-frequency component produced by <b>flexions</b> of the male pedipalp (stridulation). While {{the components of the}} idle display are also produced by independent structures, the leg drumming and palp <b>flexions</b> occur serially and do not overlap in time.
