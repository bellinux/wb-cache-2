25|$|Gloria Alvarez {{claims the}} riots {{did not create}} social {{distance}} between Hispanics and blacks, but rather united them. Although the riots were perceived in different aspects, Alvarez argues it brought {{a greater sense of}} understanding between Hispanics and blacks. Even though Hispanics now <b>heavily</b> <b>populate</b> the area that was once predominantly black, such transition has improved over time. The building of a stronger and more understanding community could help to prevent social chaos arising between the two groups.

5|$|Although <b>heavily</b> <b>populated</b> {{prior to}} the conquest, the impact of Old World {{diseases}} {{was one of the}} factors that resulted in the depopulation of the hot, moist lands of the Depresión Central, which remain sparsely populated to this day. Likewise, Soconusco was rapidly depopulated as a result of disease soon after contact with the Spanish. Among the most deadly diseases were smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis.|$|E

40|$|During {{the course}} of our {{analysis}} of fish and other aquatic materials for pesticide residues, unknown components were often detected. Concern about the identity of late eluting gas-liquid chromatographic (GLC) peaks in fish and water extracts led to the identification of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) as environmental contaminants (1). Further study of these contaminants with a GLC-mass spectrometer (GLC-MS) led to their identification as di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP). Preliminary data from acute toxicity tests indicate that these compounds are relatively low in toxicity. Chronic studies, however, indicate that they may have more subtle effects on reproduction of some aquatic species (2). Residue data obtained from a variety of areas, dietary materials, and samples related to fish rearing operations have established some information on the incidence of PAEs in relation to pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyl contaminants (Table 1). PAE residues in water appeared to be correlated with rivers draining industrialized or <b>heavily</b> <b>populate...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{volcanic}} {{rocks on}} the slopes of seamounts are <b>heavily</b> <b>populated</b> by suspension feeders, particularly corals, which capitalize on the strong currents around the seamount to supply them with food. This is in sharp contrast with the typical deep-sea habitat, where deposit-feeding animals rely on food they get off the ground. In tropical zones extensive coral growth results in the formation of coral atolls late in the seamount's life.|$|E

5|$|The {{reason for}} the lack of landfalls is that {{tropical}} cyclones in the northern hemisphere usually travel to the west. In the Atlantic, this sends hurricanes towards North America. In the eastern Pacific, this sends tropical cyclones out into the open ocean to dissipate over waters too cool to support them or in environments with high wind shear. Hawaii, the only <b>heavily</b> <b>populated</b> island chain in the eastern Pacific, is protected from most hurricanes by a subtropical ridge and is small enough to avoid being hit simply due to low odds.|$|E

40|$|Sex steroid hormones {{influence}} the perceptual processing of sensory signals in vertebrates. In particular, {{decades of research}} have shown that circulating levels of estrogen correlate with hearing function. The mechanisms and sites of action supporting this sensory-neuroendocrine modulation, however, remain unknown. Here we combined a molecular cloning strategy, fluorescence in-situ hybridization and unbiased quantification methods to show that estrogen-producing and -sensitive neurons <b>heavily</b> <b>populate</b> the adult mouse primary auditory cortex (AI). We also show that auditory experience in freely-behaving animals engages estrogen-producing and -sensitive neurons in AI. These estrogen-associated networks are greatly stable, and do not quantitatively change {{as a result of}} acute episodes of sensory experience. We further demonstrate the neurochemical identity of estrogen-producing and estrogen-sensitive neurons in AI and show that these cell populations are phenotypically distinct. Our findings provide the first direct demonstration that estrogen-associated circuits are highly prevalent and engaged by sensory experience in the mouse auditory cortex, and suggest that previous correlations between estrogen levels and hearing function may be related to brain-generated hormone production. Finally, our findings suggest that estrogenic modulation may be a central component of the operational framework of central auditory networks...|$|R

5|$|With {{the area}} around Woking by this time <b>heavily</b> <b>populated,</b> the LNC's land {{holdings}} had become an extremely valuable asset, and from 1955 onwards the LNC became a target for repeated hostile takeover bids from property speculators. In January 1959 the Alliance Property Company announced the successful takeover of the London Necropolis Company, bringing over a century of independence to an end. Alliance Property was a property company with {{little interest in the}} funeral business, and the income from burials was insufficient to maintain the cemetery grounds. Brookwood Cemetery went into decline and the cemetery began to revert to wilderness. This trend continued under a succession of further owners.|$|E

TFG forces alleged to have failed to efficaciously warn civilians in combat zones, impeded relief efforts, plundered property, in some instances engaged in murder and violence, and mistreated detainees during mass arrests. According to HRW, the implicated TFG forces included military, police and intelligence personnel, as well as the private guards of senior TFG officials. Victims were often unable to identify TFG personnel, and confused militiamen aligned with TFG officials with TFG police officers and other state security personnel.|$|E

50|$|The δ-opioid {{receptor}}, {{also known}} as delta opioid receptor or simply delta receptor, abbreviated DOR, is a 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor, that has enkephalins as its endogenous ligands. The regions of the brain where the δ-opioid receptor is largely expressed vary from species model to species model. In humans, the δ-opioid receptor is most heavily expressed in the basal ganglia and neocortical regions of the brain; the basal ganglia, which is <b>heavily</b> GABA <b>populated,</b> {{has been linked to}} major depressive disorder, suggesting a possible role for the δ-opioid receptor in mood modulation.|$|R
40|$|Myotilin is a muscle-specific Z-disc protein with {{putative}} {{roles in}} myofibril assembly and structural upkeep of the sarcomere. Several myotilin point mutations {{have been described}} in patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1 A (LGMD 1 A), myofibrillar myopathy (MFM), spheroid body myopathy (SBM), three similar adult-onset, progressive and autosomal dominant muscular dystrophies. To further investigate myotilin’s role in the pathogenesis of these muscle diseases, we have characterized three independent lines of trans-genic mice expressing mutant (T 57 I) myotilin {{under the control of}} the human skeletal actin promoter. Similar to LGMD 1 A and MFM patients, these mice develop progressive myofibrillar pathology that includes Z-disc streaming, excess myofibrillar vacuolization and plaque-like myofibrillar aggregation. These aggregates become progressively larger and more numerous with age. We show that the mutant myotilin protein properly localizes to the Z-disc and also <b>heavily</b> <b>populates</b> the aggregates, along with several other Z-disc associated proteins. Whole muscle physiological analysis reveals that the extensor digitorum longus muscle of transgenic mice exhibits significantly reduced maximum specific isometric force compared with littermate controls. Intriguingly, the soleus and diaphragm muscles are spared of any abnormal myopathol-ogy and show no reductions in maximum specific force. These data provide evidence that myotilin mutations promote aggregate-dependent contractile dysfunction. In sum, we have established a promising patho-physiological mouse model that unifies the phenotypes of LGMD 1 A, MFM and SBM...|$|R
