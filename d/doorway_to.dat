5|$|Early in the 18th century, John Hylton (died 1712), {{the second}} son of Henry Hylton, de jure 16th Baron Hylton, gutted the {{interior}} {{to form a}} three-storeyed block (one room on each floor). He also inserted large, alternating, pedimented sash windows in the Italianate style and added a three-storeyed north wing to the castle (as seen in Bucks' engraving of 1728). A <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> the new wing was added and approached by a semi-circular staircase. Above the doorway was a coat of arms, {{believed to be the}} one created to commemorate the marriage between John Hylton and his wife, Dorothy Musgrave. It is now located above the <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> The Golden Lion Inn at South Hylton, {{on the opposite side of}} the River Wear.|$|E

The other door leaving the Blessed Sacrament Chapel is topped by carvings of shields representing three medieval universities, Oxford, Paris, and Salamanca, and flanked by carvings representing the seven liberal arts (the Trivium and the Quadrivium) and the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the game, the Abyss-dwelling wizard brothers Garamon and Tyball accidentally summon a demon, the Slasher of Veils, while experimenting with inter-dimensional travel. Garamon is used as bait to lure the demon into a room imbued with virtue. However, the demon offers Tyball great power if he betrays Garamon. Tyball agrees, but the betrayal fails; Garamon is killed, but seals the demon inside the room. Because he lacks virtue, Tyball cannot re-enter by himself, and plans to sacrifice Baron Almric's daughter, Arial, at the <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> gain entrance.|$|E
5|$|Despite this outburst, {{the studio}} liked him, and before his three-week {{contract}} was up—while {{the film was}} still shooting—they gave Cagney a three-week extension, which {{was followed by a}} full seven-year contract at $400 a week. The contract, however, allowed Warners to drop him at the end of any 40-week period, effectively only guaranteeing him 40 weeks income at a time. As when he was growing up, Cagney shared his income with his family. Cagney received good reviews, and immediately starred in another gangster role in The <b>Doorway</b> <b>to</b> Hell. The film was a financial hit, helping cement Cagney's growing reputation. He made four more movies before his breakthrough role.|$|E

5|$|Ten {{days after}} Kennedy was assassinated, the Associated Press in Dallas {{reported}} that Altgens' first photograph along Elm Street had {{captured the attention}} of people who noticed that one of the men standing in the main <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> the book depository appeared to resemble the accused killer Lee Harvey Oswald. Those observers raised the question of whether Oswald could have killed Kennedy, saying he {{would not have been able}} to get to the doorway from the sixth floor of the building. The report quoted depository superintendent Roy Truly, who identified fellow employee Billy Lovelady as the man in the image. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the AP they had already investigated the photograph and also identified Lovelady.|$|E
5|$|Sutton Court {{is built}} of squared and coursed {{sandstone}} rubble throughout with freestone and ashlar dressings, copings, slate roofs. The north front comprises a central three-storey fourteenth century pele tower with a taller circular stair turret and two-storey ranges linking {{it to the}} 1558 'Bess of Hardwick Building' {{to the left and}} a four bay 1858–1860 servants' wing of three storeys to the right. Windows to the pele tower and right-hand linking range are 15th century, of two cusped lights with hood moulds, some of which have been renewed, and some relocated from other areas. The <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> the tower dates from 1858–60. The windows to the left-hand linking range and the 'Hardwick Building' are four and six lights, with chamfered mullions. The two-storey 'Hardwick' range has diagonal offset buttresses. There are eighteenth-century battlements to the pele tower, with tall octagonal ashlar stacks.|$|E
5|$|Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) {{is a small}} {{oil panel}} by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably {{executed}} between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips {{the hem of her}} red dress in a manner that recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch {{at the rear of the}} nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to her surroundings. The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's ethereal presence.|$|E

25|$|When {{it first}} opened on October 27, 1904, Times Square {{was a local}} station on New York City's first subway, so named by IRT {{president}} August Belmont because it was located directly under the Times Building, headquarters of The New York Times. Three shuttle tracks have served it since 1918; the southbound express track was removed and replaced by a temporary wooden platform {{for access to the}} original northbound express track. The former southbound platform (serving track 1) still has a vestiges of a <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> the Knickerbocker Hotel, while the northbound platform (serving track 4) retains a former <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> the Times Building.|$|E

Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the gurdwara (also gurduārā, meaning the <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> God; sometimes transliterated as gurudwara). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, {{as well as in}} almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.|$|E
25|$|The House of the Virgin Mary near Selçuk, Turkey. This is {{a shrine}} frequented by both Christians and Muslims. It {{is known as}} Panaya Kapulu ("the <b>Doorway</b> <b>to</b> the Virgin") in Turkish. Pilgrims drink water from a spring under her house which is {{believed}} to have healing properties. Perhaps the shrine's most distinctive feature is the Mereyemana or wishing wall on which visitors attach their written wishes; because the House of the Virgin Mary is increasingly famous internationally, these messages are composed in English, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, French and Spanish, as well as Turkish. A giant statue of the Virgin Mary – similar in dimensions to that of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro – is planned to be erected {{in the vicinity of the}} shrine.|$|E
25|$|The <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> DIO's mansion is {{guarded by}} Terence T. D'Arby, younger brother of D'Arby the Gambler. His Stand, Atum, steals Kakyoin's soul after {{a round of}} video games, but despite D'Arby's mind games Jotaro is able to outwit him by having Joseph's Hermit Purple {{manipulate}} the games in his favor. Meanwhile, Polnareff, Iggy, and Avdol easily dispose of Kenny G, whose Tenore Sax Stand creates an illusory maze. Avdol is then killed by an invisible force that is revealed as DIO's henchman, Vanilla Ice, whose Stand Cream swallows itself into another dimension and instantly obliterates anything its sphere of destruction touches. Ice, who killed himself for DIO but was revived by DIO's blood, is able to nearly eliminate Polnareff, but a valiant sacrifice by Iggy allows Polnareff to ultimately win. Meanwhile, Jotaro, Joseph, and Kakyoin encounter Nukesaku the Idiot, but easily defeat him.|$|E

25|$|In 1610, a visitor, Father João Álvares, {{recommended}} {{the construction of}} an actual sanctuary, which was begun, and would actually be the center of the devotion to Nossa Senhora da Lapa in Portugal, India and Brazil, through missionaries who travelled from this location. The ordered construction included iron grades, a portable altar to the north, remodelling of the dependencies and construction of a house for the treasurer, while expanding the religious buildings, courtyard and purchasing guesthouses for visitors. In addition, there was the authorization to cover the altar in a wood structure, and construct a gilded altar dedicated to the Baby Jesus, flanked by images of Saints Ignatius and Francis Xavier. A triumphal arch and extension to the church body also progressed, with the respective axial and transversal porticos in the south, along with a third <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> access the sacristy and guesthouse. To the north, the Casa dos Pesos was constructed, with collateral retables, as well as a pulpit in front of the Chaepl of Santo Cristo.|$|E
