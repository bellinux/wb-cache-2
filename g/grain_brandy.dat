50|$|In the past, kvevris {{were also}} used for storing <b>brandy,</b> <b>grain,</b> butter, cheese {{and a variety of}} other {{perishable}} foodstuffs, although in Georgia they have always been primarily used for wine-making. Large ceramic storage vessels such as these are made in many countries, but only Georgia, Spain (vino de tinaja, vino de pitarra) and Portugal (vinho de talha) use them for wine-making.|$|R
5000|$|Alcohol is {{strictly}} licensed or otherwise illegal in Pakistan. However unregulated production {{in rural areas}} thrives. Products include tharra and its variants including what is ironically known as [...] "Hunza water" [...] and rudimentary beers made from barley, rye and other <b>grain</b> mixtures. Some <b>brandy</b> is also produced in the north where fruit is more readily available. Methanol contamination {{is a serious problem}} in some regions.|$|R
50|$|A drink named Skylab Fallout, {{similar in}} appearance, was created at Pat O'Brien's in New Orleans in 1979, {{during the time}} of the Skylab descent back to Earth. The Skylab Fallout was concocted with blue curaçao liqueur, apricot <b>brandy,</b> <b>grain</b> alcohol, rum and orange juice. In its preparation, liquids that are the densest settle at the bottom of a glass. This Pat O'Brien's {{creation}} involved the alcohol strength increasing as one drank it, with stronger alcoholic beverages existing in the lower layers of the cocktail.|$|R
50|$|The Bermuda sloop {{became the}} {{predominant}} type of sailing vessel {{both in the}} Bermudian colony and among sloop rigs worldwide as Bermudian traders visited foreign nations. Soon, shipbuilding {{became one of the}} primary trades on the island and ships were exported throughout the English colonies on the American seaboard, in the West Indies, and eventually to Europe. Bermudians, largely slaves, built roughly a thousand ships during the 18th century. Although many of these were sold abroad, the colony maintained its own large merchant fleet which, thanks partly to the domination of trade in many American seaboard ports by branches of wealthy Bermudian families and partly to the suitability and availability of Bermudian vessels, carried much of the produce exported from the American south to Bermuda and to the West Indies aboard Bermudian mostly slave-manned vessels sailed southwest (more-or-less upwind) to the Turk Islands, where salt was harvested. This salt was carried to North American ports and sold at high profits. Bermudian vessels also developed a trade in moving goods such as <b>grain,</b> cocoa, <b>brandy,</b> wine and more from the Atlantic seaboard colonies to the West Indies.|$|R
50|$|Tlacotalpan {{reached its}} height as a port {{city in the}} 19th century. At the {{beginning}} of this century, French, German and Italian immigrants came to the area to plant and weave cotton, to be sold in English markets. Starting in 1821, Tlacotalpan experienced economic grown as a port for products from Oaxaca and Puebla going to Veracruz and abroad to New Orleans, Havana and Bordeaux. By 1855 it was home to eighteen steamships and a large sailing ship which transported timber, tobacco, cotton, <b>grain,</b> sugar, <b>brandy,</b> leather, salted meat, crocodiles, heron feathers, furniture and soap. In 1825 one of Mexico’s first nautical colleges was opened, founded by Guadalupe Victoria. In 1847, Tlacotalpan was officially declared a town in recognition of its participation in the defense against U.S. forces in the Mexican American War. In 1864 the town was taken by French forces under Marechal one day after taking Alvarado. Later that same year, Republican forces under Alejandro Garcia retook the area. In 1865 it was declared a city and provisional capital for its resistance against the French. In 1879, Miguel Z. Cházaro founded Veracruz’s third preparatory school. Here Porfirio Díaz organized an uprising against the government of Lerdo de Tejada, which led to a name change of Tlacotalpan de Porfirio Díaz in 1896. This was changed to the current version after the Mexican Revolution. At the beginning of the 20th century, the town has eight schools, three hotels, nine factories and 100 single-storied houses.|$|R
