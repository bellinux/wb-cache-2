40|$|Topological spin {{structures}} such as {{magnetic domain}} walls, vortices, and skyrmions, have been receiving great interest because of their high potential application in various spintronic devices. To utilize {{them in the future}} spintronic devices, it is first necessary to understand the dynamics of the topological spin structures. Since <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> plays {{a crucial role in the}} dynamics of a particle, understanding the <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> of topological spin structures is an important task. Here, we report that a strong <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> appears steadily when a skyrmion is driven by an oscillating spin-Hall-spintorque (SHST). We find that the skyrmion exhibits an inertia-driven hypocycloid-type trajectory when it is excited by the oscillating SHST. This motion has not been achieved by an oscillating magnetic field, which only excites the breathing mode without the <b>inertial</b> <b>effect.</b> The distinct <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> can be explained in terms of a spin wave excitation in the skyrmion boundary which is induced by the non-uniform SHST. Furthermore, the inertia-driven resonant excitation provides a way of experimentally estimating the inertial mass of the skyrmion. Our results therefore pave the way for the development of skyrmion-based device applications...|$|R

25|$|Turbulence is the {{time-dependent}} chaotic behavior seen in many fluid flows.

It is believed, though not known with certainty, that the Navier–Stokes equations describe turbulence properly.|$|E
40|$|In this endeavor, the {{transients}} persisting in {{a vacuum}} ejector system (put reference of my old paper) is studied by numerically simulating the flow field, and experimentally validating the simulated results. An <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> was discovered in the study due to which the direction of mass flux changes. As a result of this, the recirculation zone moves forward and backward during the transients and the pressure in the secondary chamber rises and falls. The system behaves as a damped oscillatory flow in which the direction of mass flux keeps on changing and finally settles down to a state {{where there is no}} mass flux in either direction. The movement of recirculation zone due to this <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> is studied in more detail for various flow and geometric parameters. The results obtained show that the pressure and mass flux through the secondary chamber depend highly on both the thickness of the primary and secondary jet and the chamber volume. The <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> reduces with the reduction in thickness of primary and secondary flow. The <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> is found to be decreasing with increasing secondary chamber volume. It is also found that, the <b>inertial</b> <b>effect</b> decreases as the primary jet pressure increases, for all other parameters remaining the same.

25|$|In contrast, high Reynolds numbers (Re>>1) {{indicate}} that the <b>inertial</b> <b>effects</b> have more effect on the velocity field than the viscous (friction) effects. In high Reynolds number flows, the flow is often modeled as an inviscid flow, an approximation in which viscosity is completely neglected. Eliminating viscosity allows the Navier–Stokes equations to be simplified into the Euler equations. The integration of the Euler equations along a streamline in an inviscid flow yields Bernoulli's equation. When, {{in addition to being}} inviscid, the flow is irrotational everywhere, Bernoulli's equation can completely describe the flow everywhere. Such flows are called potential flows, because the velocity field may be expressed as the gradient of a potential energy expression.|$|E
25|$|The rate of {{polymerization}} {{depends on}} input power, until power saturation occurs {{and the rate}} becomes independent of it. A narrower electrode gap also tends to increase polymerization rates because a higher electron density per unit area is formed. Polymerization rates also depend {{on the type of}} apparatus used for the process. In general, increasing the frequency of alternating current glow discharge up to about 5kHz increases the rate due to the formation of more free radicals. After this frequency, <b>inertial</b> <b>effects</b> of colliding monomers inhibit polymerization. This forms the first plateau for polymerization frequencies. A second maximum in frequency occurs at 6MHz, where side reactions are overcome again and the reaction occurs through free radicals diffused from plasma to the electrodes, at which point a second plateau is obtained. These parameters differ slightly for each monomer and must be optimized in-situ.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scientists}} and philosophers of science were critical of Newton's definitions of absolute space and time. Ernst Mach (1883) argued that absolute {{time and space}} are essentially metaphysical concepts and thus scientifically meaningless, and suggested that only relative motion between material bodies is a useful concept in physics. Mach argued that even effects that according to Newton depend on accelerated motion with respect to absolute space, such as rotation, could be described purely with reference to material bodies, and that the <b>inertial</b> <b>effects</b> cited by Newton in support of absolute space might instead be related purely to acceleration {{with respect to the}} fixed stars. Carl Neumann (1870) introduced a [...] "Body alpha", which represents some sort of rigid and fixed body for defining inertial motion. Based on the definition of Neumann, Heinrich Streintz (1883) argued that in a coordinate system where gyroscopes don't measure any signs of rotation, then one can speak of inertial motion which is related to a [...] "Fundamental body" [...] and a [...] "Fundamental Coordinate System". Eventually, Ludwig Lange (1885) was the first to coin the expression inertial frame of reference and [...] "inertial time scale" [...] as operational replacements for absolute space and time; he defined [...] "inertial frame" [...] as [...] "a reference frame in which a mass point thrown from the same point in three different (non-co-planar) directions follows rectilinear paths each time it is thrown". In 1902, Henri Poincaré published a collection of essays titled Science and Hypothesis, which included: detailed philosophical discussions on the relativity of space, time, and on the conventionality of distant simultaneity; the conjecture that a violation of the relativity principle can never be detected; the possible non-existence of the aether, together with some arguments supporting the aether; and many remarks on non-Euclidean vs. Euclidean geometry.|$|E

Water velocities around the forward bubble surface are approximately predicted using the numerical {{solution to the}} Navier-Stokes equation.

The relevant analytical and approximate solutions for a bubble mobile and immobile surface are reviewed. Numerical solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations with particular reference on the flow fore-and-aft asymmetry, surface vorticity and surface pressure are graphically illustrated and discussed. Based on the analytical, approximate and numerical solutions, the liquid velocity components in close proximity to a surface of air bubbles with intermediate Reynolds numbers and finite gas holdups are predicted. Application of the predicted velocity components is illustrated for the modelling of the bubble–particle encounter and sliding interactions.
