In a switched-circuit network, devices known as switches are used to connect the calling party to the called party. Each switch has a number of inlets and outlets, and by connecting a specific inlet to the correct outlet, each switch helps to complete an end-to-end circuit between users. This method is used in, for example <b>graded</b> <b>multiple</b> banks of selectors.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{representation}} of multiplication operation on fuzzy numbers is very useful and {{important in the}} fuzzy system such as the fuzzy decision making. In this paper, we propose a new arithmetical principle and a new arithmetical method for the arithmetical operations on fuzzy numbers. The new arithmetical principle is the L− 1 -R− 1 inverse function arithmetic principle. Based on the L− 1 -R− 1 inverse function arithmetic principle, {{it is easy to}} interpret the multiplication operation with the membership functions of fuzzy numbers. The new arithmetical method is the <b>graded</b> <b>multiple</b> integrals representation method. Based on the <b>graded</b> <b>multiple</b> integrals representation method, it is easy to compute the canonical {{representation of}} multiplication operation on fuzzy numbers. Finally, the canonical representation is applied to a numerical example of fuzzy decision...|$|E

These type-I IC lasers are composed of 6 -cascade stages and InAs/AlSb superlattice cladding layers. In contrast {{to the use of}} quinary AlGaInAsSb barriers for active region in previous type-I QW lasers, the type-I QW active region in each stage is sandwiched by digitally <b>graded</b> <b>multiple</b> InAs/AlSb QW electron injector and GaSb/AlSb QW hole injector. The fabricated type-I IC lasers were able to operate in continuous wave and pulsed modes at temperatures up to 306 and 365 K, respectively.

40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out among 281 men and women aged between 30 and 64 years {{randomly}} selected from five general practices located in the inner London borough of Tower Hamlets, to determine the prevalence of risk factors for coronary heart disease. Smoking and obesity were both more pronounced in Tower Hamlets than in comparable national studies: 51 % of men and 44 % of women were smokers and 57 % of these were smoking 20 or more cigarettes per day. A body mass index of 30 or more was present in 18 % of men and 10 % of women and a body mass index of 25 or more in 71 % of men and 49 % of women. Two or more risk factors for coronary heart disease (smoking and/or hypertension and/or raised cholesterol levels) were present in 25 % of men and 22 % of women. For every person known by their general practitioner to have established cardiovascular disease, there were an additional two people also at risk {{on the basis of}} multiple risk factors. In this inner city population the prevalence of cardiovascular risk, for women as well as men, has major resource and organizational implications for primary care.

40|$|Triamcinolone acetonide (TACA) is a corticosteroid; {{it is used}} in the {{systemic}} and topical treatment of a variety of inflammatory conditions, including eczema and psoriasis. Conventionally, for topical use, the drug is formulated in a cream or ointment. However, it has been observed in vitro that percutaneous penetration of corticosteroids can be influenced by hydrocolloid patches. Corticosteroids produce a pallor or blanching when applied to the skin that correlates with anti-inflammatory activity; this property has been used extensively as a bioassay. The aim of this study therefore was to evaluate the occlusive properties of a range of hydrocolloid patches containing TACA on the drug's penetration in vivo using visual assessment and a <b>graded</b> <b>multiple</b> measurement. The in vivo hydration of these dermatological patches was also investigated. Statistical analysis of the weight gains of patches containing either NaCMC 39 % or pectin 39 % showed that {{there was a significant difference}} in the rates of hydration of the two types of patch (p <. 005). An increase in application time of the hydrocolloid patches allowed more TACA to be released, which was illustrated by an increase in both the maximum percentage total possible score (%TPS) values and AUC, although changes in the hydrocolloid composition did not significantly alter the blanching response. All of the patches adhered well, were unobtrusive to the normal activity of the wearers, and showed great potential for the convenient, localized, prolonged delivery of drugs to the skin...|$|E
40|$|In the {{introductory}} chemistry course for first year {{students at the}} University of Guelph, written answer questions are included on midterm and final exams, despite the logistical hurdles involved in grading 1800 - 2400 students’ solutions. The process was improved {{with the development of}} a customized Scantron® form on which students wrote their answers. Teaching assistants (TAs) graded students’ work and bubbled in the grades on the sheet which was then read into the computer. As well as improving the grade entry process, it also allowed for students to have their results (and grader comments) conveniently emailed to them. For this study, we have used one of the Scantron® fields as a “TA identifier” to correlate grading with the specific grader. This allows for comparison between TAs’ grading rate, grade averages, variances, and distributions. Group and individual trends were also observed over time. Averages for four questions increased by 0. 1 - 2. 4 % points {{between the first and second}} hour of grading, and the probability of the more extreme findings occurring without a correlational link was 53 - 92 %, based on c 2 tests. In the same manner, the probabilities that differences in distributions between the population and a particular TA’s sampling occurred by chance ranged from ~ 0 - 99 %. We discuss these results and how they may impact our confidence in the final grade assigned to a particular student. We also aim to use these results to develop new statistical treatments of inter-rater consistency for large sample sizes that require minimal to no exams to be <b>graded</b> <b>multiple</b> times, resulting in saving time when studying a large number of graders...|$|E

40|$|Cell {{adhesion}} in {{the normal}} colon is typically associated with differentiated cells, whereas in cancerous colon it is associated with advanced tumors. For advanced tumors growing evidence supports the existence of stem-like cells that have originated from transdifferentiation. Because stem cells can also be transformed in their own niche, {{at the base of}} the Lieberkühn's crypts, we conjectured that cell adhesion can also be critical in early tumorigenesis. To assess this hypothesis we built an annotated, multi-valued logic model addressing cell adhesion of normal and tumorigenic stem cells in the human colon. The model accounts for (i) events involving intercellular adhesion structures, (ii) interactions involving cytoskeleton-related structures, (iii) compartmental distribution of α/β/γ/δ-catenins, and (iv) variations in critical cell adhesion regulators (e. g., ILK, FAK, IQGAP, SNAIL, Caveolin). We developed a method that can deal with <b>graded</b> <b>multiple</b> inhibitions, something which is not possible with conventional logical approaches. The model comprises 315 species (including 26 genes), interconnected by 269 reactions. Simulations of the model covered six scenarios, which considered two types of colonic cells (stem vs. differentiated cells), under three conditions (normal, stressed and tumor). Each condition results from the combination of 92 inputs. We compared our multi-valued logic approach with the conventional Boolean approach for one specific example and validated the predictions against published data. Our analysis suggests that stem cells in their niche synthesize high levels of cytoplasmatic E-cadherin and CdhEP(Ser 684, 686, 692), even under normal-mitogenic stimulus or tumorigenic conditions. Under these conditions, E-cadherin would be incorporated into the plasmatic membrane, but only as a non-adhesive CdhE-β-catenin-IQGAP complex. Under stress conditions, however, this complex could be displaced, yielding adhesive CdhE-β- catenin (cis/trans) complexes. In the three scenarios tested with stem cells, desmosomes or tight junctions were not assembled. Other model predictions include expected levels of the nuclear complex β-catenin-TCF 4 and the anti-apoptotic protein Survivin for both normal and tumorigenic colonic stem cells. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|E
