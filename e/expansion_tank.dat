50|$|An older {{style of}} <b>expansion</b> <b>tank</b> was larger, {{oriented}} horizontally, {{and had no}} rubber diaphragm separating {{the water from the}} air pocket. This now obsolete style would gradually transfer air from the tank to the highest point in the system, due to air dissolving in the water, and then coming out of solution elsewhere in the system. This in turn required periodic draining of the <b>expansion</b> <b>tank,</b> as well as periodic bleeding of the system, to maintain its effectiveness.|$|E

40|$|O presente estudo teve por objetivo avaliar a evolução da {{microbiota}} do ovo integral líquido (OIL) armazenado em câmaras de resfriamento e tanques de expansão, verificando a eficiência desses métodos de conservação. Foram obtidas 144 amostras, sendo 72 provenientes de três propriedades com armazenamento de OIL em tanques de expansão e 72 de três propriedades com armazenamento de OIL em câmaras de resfriamento. Foi pesquisada a presença de Salmonella spp. e quantificados os micro-organismos aeróbios mesófilos, psicrotróficos, coliformes totais, Escherichia coli e Staphylococcus aureus, acompanhando a evolução desses micro-organismos entre os intervalos de tempo de 0, 24, 48 e 72 horas, sob temperaturas entre 2 º e 5 ºC. Constatou-se que no OIL estudado, tanto as câmaras de resfriamento quanto os tanques de expansão foram eficientes no controle da evolução dos micro-organismos quantificados, exceto no controle dos psicrotróficos. O OIL avaliado revelou grande contaminação advinda do processo de produção e quebra que antecedem a refrigeração. A presença de Salmonella spp. foi constatada em 36 (75 %) das amostras analisadas. Em ambos os tipos de conservação, observou-se contagens iniciais acima dos padrões estabelecidos pela legislação para micro-organismos aeróbios mesófilos, Escherichia coli e Staphylococcus aureus. As contagens de micro-organismos psicrotróficos e colifiormes totais não possuem parâmetros legais, mas, utilizando-se o padrão para aeróbios mesófilos, também foram elevadas. Quando comparado a população microbiana do OIL nos dois tipos de armazenamento, a contaminação total e a de origem fecal foram mais elevadas em câmaras de resfriamento e em tanques de expansão, respectivamente.

It was observed that in the LWE studied, cooling chambers and <b>expansion</b> <b>tanks</b> were effective in controlling the evolution of the quantified microorganisms, except in the growth of psychrotrophs. The LWE evaluated revealed large contamination originating from the production process and egg breaking that precedes refrigeration. The presence of Salmonella spp. was observed in 36 (75 %) of the samples. In both conservation methods, there were initial counts above the limits established for mesophilic aerobes, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The enumeration of psychrotrophs and total coliforms lack legal parameters, but when confronted with the limits established for mesophilic aerobes, were also elevated. When compared the enumeration differences between the microorganisms studied in the LWE from the cooling chambers and <b>expansion</b> <b>tanks,</b> the results showed greater total contamination in the LWE stored in cooling chambers and greater fecal contamination in this product stored in <b>expansion</b> <b>tanks...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{refrigeration}} of {{milk and}} the usage of mechanical milking are important to obtain milk in accordance with quality standards. In this work we evaluated {{the influence of the}} type of milking process and type of storage {{on the quality of the}} refrigerated milk. It was obtained 1363 refrigerated milk samples stored in single or collective <b>expansion</b> <b>tanks,</b> from manually or mechanically milked animals. The experiment was carried out in a 2 x 2 randomized factorial scheme. Two types of <b>expansion</b> <b>tanks</b> (single and collective) and two types of milking (manual and mechanical). The average comparison test and Tukey test was carried out with 95 % confidence. The levels of fat, protein, lactose and defatted dry extract, were evaluated according to the type of milking and type of milk storage. The values obtained were higher when compared to the values stabilished by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply. The level of milk fat was higher in samples with somatic cell count above 501, 000 SC/mL. However, the levels of protein and defatted dry extract were higher in samples with somatic cell count below 500, 000 SC/mL. The type of milking and the type of storage have influence on parameters related to milk quality such as levels of fat, protein, lactose and somatic cell count. The milk chemical composition revealed in accordance with the values stabilished by the Brazilian legislation. The total bacterial count did not vary with storage type nor the type of milking...|$|R
50|$|Water expands as it heats and {{contracts}} as it cools. A water-loop hydronic system must {{have one or}} more expansion tanks in the system to accommodate this varying volume of the working fluid. These tanks often use a rubber diaphragm pressurised with compressed air. The <b>expansion</b> <b>tank</b> accommodates the expanded water by further air compression and helps maintain a roughly constant pressure in the system across the expected change in fluid volume. Simple cisterns open to atmospheric pressure are also used.|$|E
5000|$|For older houses {{where the}} water heater {{is part of the}} space heating boiler, and {{plumbing}} codes allow, some plumbers install an automatic gas shutoff (such as the [...] "Watts 210") in addition to a TPR valve. When the device senses that the temperature reaches , it shuts off the gas supply and prevents further heating. In addition, an <b>expansion</b> <b>tank</b> or exterior pressure relief valve must be installed to prevent pressure buildup in the plumbing from rupturing pipes, valves, or the water heater.|$|E
50|$|An <b>expansion</b> <b>tank</b> {{contains}} compressed gas, {{separated from}} the sealed-system water by a diaphragm. This allows for normal variations of pressure in the system. A safety valve allows water {{to escape from the}} system when pressure becomes too high, and a valve can open to replenish water from the normal water supply if the pressure drops too low. Sealed systems offer an alternative to open-vent systems, in which steam can escape from the system, and gets replaced from the building's water supply via a feed and central storage system.|$|E
5000|$|In the UK, {{prior to}} the use of sealed <b>expansion</b> <b>tanks,</b> [...] "open" [...] tanks were {{installed}} in the roof space to accommodate the water's expansion; these had the disadvantage of being exposed to the cold air in the roof space. This, without effective loft insulation, could fall below freezing, and could cause the pipework supplying the tank to freeze. However, with good pipe and tank insulation, this was in practice quite rare. Although such systems were remarkably trouble free, there are concerns about the potability of water from roof tanks due to the possibility of contamination. The other major disadvantage is that the water pressure from a roof tank is considerably lower than mains water pressure, making the use of mixer taps sometimes unpredictable.|$|R

50|$|Another safety {{mechanisms}} of boilers is the control safety devices. One control safety device is the low water cut off switch. This device detects {{the amount of}} water in the boiler. A low amount of water flowing to a boiler could potentially cause a boiler to overheat ultimately damaging the boiler. The safety mechanism used to control firing rate of boiler is called the operating switch. This operating switch also has the ability to turn the boiler on and off. This switch is inspected to ensure proper functioning ability. Pressure control devices include the operating switch and the high temperature limit switch. These prevent over pressurizing of the boiler by controlling firing rate and providing an automatic shut off if temperature reaches beyond safe operating conditions. <b>Expansion</b> <b>tanks</b> are used in boilers to allow the expansion and contraction of water to travel somewhere.|$|R
