Spring <b>flowering</b> <b>bulbs</b> offer an early start to a full season of color in your garden. You can choose from hundreds of spring <b>flowering</b> <b>bulbs</b> that produce plants varying in flower color, form and height.

All 2 ̆ 2 bulb 2 ̆ 2 plants have a food storage organ that allows the plants to survive when dormant or when growing conditions are unsuitable. Bulbs are underground organs formed by fleshy scales attached to a basal plate (for example, tulip, narcissus, lily). Corms are underground swollen stems surrounded by dry, scale-like leaves (gladiolus, freesia, crocus). Tubers are swollen underground stems that are often irregularly shaped (potato, gloriosa, ranunculus).

5000|$|<b>Flower</b> <b>bulb</b> {{cultivation}} {{takes place}} in Kennemerland in North Holland. The area extends roughly from the Haarlem area (including villages {{to the south and}} west of Haarlem) to Petten (northwest of Alkmaar). Wealthy merchants from Haarlem and Amsterdam introduced the cultivation of flower bulbs on a small scale basis in the sandy soil located close to the dunes in the 16th century. After the Tulip Mania crash of 1637, floriculture strongly declined. Unlike in the Duin- en Bollenstreek to the south, Kennemerland was not—despite the broad dune area south of Castricum—extensively cultivated for this purpose. In the 19th century the area had been earmarked for preservation of the Amsterdam water supply (Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen) and as a location for the national steel company (Koninklijke Hoogovens).|$|E

40|$|A {{major problem}} in <b>flower</b> <b>bulb</b> {{cultivation}} is weed control. Synthetic herbicides are mainly used, although they cause a range of problems, and integrated weed control through application of naturally occurring allelochemicals would be highly desirable. <b>Flower</b> <b>bulb</b> production creates large amounts of leftover biomass. Utilizing this source for weed control may provide new applications of the bulb crops. We therefore screened 33 <b>flower</b> <b>bulb</b> extracts for allelochemical activity against weeds. Several methanol and chloroform extracts were observed to inhibit germination and growth of Senecio vulgaris L. and Lolium perenne L., as representatives of di- and mono-cotyledonous weeds, respectively. Narciclasine was identified as the bioactive compound in Narcissus. The extract of Amaryllis belladonna L. was equally active, but did not contain any narciclasine. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the A. belladonna extract resulted {{in the identification of}} lycorine as the bio-active compound. The IC 50 measured for radicle growth inhibition was 0. 10 µM for narciclasine and 0. 93 µM for lycorine, compared to 0. 11 mM of chlorpropham, a synthetic herbicide. Therefore, the leftover biomass from the spring bulb industry represents an interesting potential source for promising allelochemicals for further studies on weed growth inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Soft rot {{is causing}} {{increasing}} {{damage in the}} <b>flower</b> <b>bulb</b> industry. Bulbous ornamentals such as Hyacinthus, Dahlia, Iris, Muscari, Freesia and Zantedeschia can be infected. Soft rot in flower bulbs is mainly caused by Dickeya spp. (Dickeya spp.) and Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora (Pectobacterium carotovorum spp. carotovorum). To identify and detect these soft rot bacterial species in several bulbous ornamentals, standard PCR methods were used. During the last four years, research was directed to optimalize cultural practises in especially Hyacinthus to avoid or minimize bacterial soft rot. To evaluate the incidence and infection route of Erwinia spp. in the production chain of hyacinth bulbs, field plots were infected by planting diseased hyacinth, iris and Zantedeschia bulbs. Subsequently, crop rotation with different <b>flower</b> <b>bulb</b> species was applied on these field plots during two growing seasons. Harvested bulbs were analysed during the handling and storage of the bulbs for Erwinia spp. by assessing symptoms {{as well as by}} using bacterial culturing- and PCR techniques.
