5|$|Within the books, {{the nature}} of the character's {{political}} opinions were often expressed through the character's rhetoric, and by heavy use of the circle-A as a character gimmick. The character's tools often incorporate the circle-A motif into them. In his earliest incarnation, he would also use red spray-paint to leave the circle-A as a calling card at crime scenes. The circle-A has also been used to decorate the character's base of operations, either as graffiti or suspended <b>from</b> <b>wall</b> tapestries.|$|E
5|$|Based on its composition, it {{is assumed}} that the magma at Licancabur formed from the partial melting of the oceanic crust subducted at the Peru-Chile Trench after metamorphosis. This magma melted part of the mantle wedge above the subducting plate, mixing with the melt products. Further {{contamination}} by crustal Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite-like rocks from the Archean, crystal fractionation and magma mixing further up in the crust then yielded the Licancabur magmas. The younger lavas may have formed from the mixing of dacite with the magmas forming the older lavas. Some inclusions in Licancabur rocks seem to be <b>from</b> <b>wall</b> rocks of the magma chamber.|$|E

However, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead. Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments <b>from</b> <b>Wall</b> Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} type of vaulted roof is {{the barrel}} vault {{in which a}} single arched surface extends <b>from</b> <b>wall</b> to wall, {{the length of the}} space to be vaulted, for example, the nave of a church. An important example, which retains Medieval paintings, is the vault of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe, France, of the early 12th century. However, the barrel vault generally required the support of solid walls, or walls in which the windows were very small.|$|E
25|$|Internally, {{the nave}} is of two open stages with simple {{semi-circular}} Romanesque openings. The arcade has piers {{of a simple}} form, each with a wide attached shaft, the alternate shafts carrying a stone arch of the high vault. The square bays thus formed are groin vaulted and plastered.

25|$|In the 17th century, {{the site}} north <b>from</b> <b>Wall</b> Street was {{occupied}} by John Damen's farm; in 1685, Damen sold the land to captain John Knight, an officer of Thomas Dongan's administration. Knight resold the land to Dongan, and Dongan resold it in 1689 to Abraham de Peyster and Nicholas Bayard. Both de Peyster and Bayard served as Mayors of New York. The first known building on the site, a sugar house, was built by Samuel Bayard. In 1718, most of the present-day block was sold to a church congregation, while the corner lot, cut into narrow strips, remained in possession of the de Peysters and the Bayards. In 1773, de Peyster sold the corner lot to the Verplanck family for less than $1,500; the Verplanck mansion later housed Wall Street banks.|$|E
25|$|The Nave, {{the body}} of the church, {{accommodates}} nine hundred sixty-six people for daily Masses and other ceremonies. The Nave has no pews, utilizing individual, movable chairs, complete with kneelers. Usually arranged in straight rows facing the altar and allowing for a center aisle and two side aisles, the chairs may also be placed in rows the length of the church, facing each other across the center aisle for special services such as those of Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Easter Vigil. It may also be noted that during the renovations by Conrad-Schmitt, the entire building was cracked down the middle and deeply in danger of collapse. To resolve this, steel strand beams were mounted <b>from</b> <b>wall</b> to wall in the nave to provide a counter push and pull action, keeping the building from falling in or out.|$|E
