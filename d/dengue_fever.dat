40|$|Background Thrombocyte and endothelial cells play an {{important}} role in <b>dengue</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> pathogenesis. Thrombomodulin is a part of glycoprotein membrane in endothelial cells. Therefore, thrombomodulin level will increase if endothelial cells disruption occurs. Objective To acknowledge the correlation between the degree of <b>dengue</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> and thrombomodulin level. Methods This was a cross-sectional study. Subjects were hospitalized pediatric patients with age ranging from one to 13 year old in pediatric ward at Pro£ Dr. R. D. Kandou Hospital, Manado, who had fever. Three milliliters of blood were taken from vein, and were divided for two tests which were routine blood analysis and thrombomodulin analysis. Different data resulted from the <b>dengue</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> group were processed, and analyzed statistically using F Test and LSD (least significant difference) test. The relation between <b>dengue</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> and thrombomodulin was analyzed with Spearman correlation coefficient. Results There was a significant result in the difference of thrombomodulin level on four <b>dengue</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> groups which were classified according to the severity of <b>dengue</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever.</b> There was a very significant positive correlation between the severity of <b>dengue</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> and thrombomodulin level in detecting endothelial cells impairment. Conclusion Thrombomodulin level can be used as a marker to detect endothelial cells impairment in <b>dengue</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever.</b> Higher grade of <b>dengue</b> hemorrhagic <b>fever</b> will have higher thrombomodulin level...|$|R

By the health belief model implementation, the patients got earlier response as soon as possible. The objective {{of the study was}} to analyze family 2 ̆ 7 s decision for visiting Puskesmas in earlier response of <b>Dengue</b> Haemorhagic <b>Fever</b> (DHF). This descriptive analytic was conducted at work area of Puskesmas Tembok Dukuh Surabaya. The population was the family with <b>Dengue</b> Haemorhagic <b>Fever</b> (DHF) patient from Januari 2007 until July 2009. Method : Clustered design was used to take the sample. Total sample were 65 respondents, taken according to inclusion criteria. The independent variables were health belief model about perceived susceptibility, perceived seriousness, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and cues to action. The dependent variable was family 2 ̆ 7 s decision for visiting Puskesmas in earlier response of <b>Dengue</b> Haemorhagic <b>Fever</b> (DHF). Data was collecting using structured questionnaire.

5|$|The floodwaters {{from the}} {{hurricane}} combined with raw sewage in many poor areas of southwestern Mexico, {{leading to a}} widespread threat for a spread of tropical diseases. As a result, government health workers opened vaccination centers in several cities along the Guerrero and Oaxaca coasts. Thousands were inoculated for typhoid fever and tetanus. Officials noted a potential threat for dengue and cholera {{as a result of}} the spoiled water. Health workers also stated mosquitos possessing malaria and <b>dengue</b> <b>fever</b> were likely to breed in large areas of leftover water. In Acapulco, about two days after the hurricane passed, the first day of sun in a week evaporated the areas of leftover water, spreading dust across the region with the deadly diseases. Residents were warned to boil their food and water for 30minutes due to the threat for contamination by the dust. At least twenty cases of cholera and at least six cases of <b>dengue</b> <b>fever</b> were reported. Most significantly, there were 14,630cases of malaria in 616villages in Oaxaca due to Pauline; this represented about 80% of the malaria cases in Mexico during 1998.

5|$|A novel {{vaccine for}} <b>dengue</b> <b>fever</b> has been {{approved}} and is commercially available {{in a number of}} countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should not be used.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{attempts}} to control {{the spread of the}} Aedes mosquito there are ongoing efforts to develop antiviral drugs that would be used to treat attacks of <b>dengue</b> <b>fever</b> and prevent severe complications. Discovery {{of the structure of the}} viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs. There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with nucleoside analogs. Secondly, it may be possible to develop specific inhibitors of the viral protease (coded by NS3), which splices viral proteins. Finally, it may be possible to develop entry inhibitors, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the 5′ capping process, which is required for viral replication.|$|E
