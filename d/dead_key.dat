25|$|Compared {{with the}} secondary-shift {{modifier}} key, the dead-key approach {{may be a}} little more complicated, but it allows more additional letters. Using the secondary shift, you may only type one or (if you use it simultaneously with the normal shift key) two additional letters with each key, whereas using a <b>dead</b> <b>key,</b> a specific diacritic can be attached to a number of different base letters.|$|E
25|$|Because {{keyboards}} {{have only}} a limited number of keys, English keyboards do not have keys for accented characters. The concept of <b>dead</b> <b>key,</b> a key that modified the meaning of the next key press, was developed to overcome this problem. This acute accent key was already present on typewriters where it typed the accent without moving the carriage, so a normal letter could be written on the same place.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{keyboard}} layout, which differs amongst countries, it {{is more or less}} easy to enter letters with diacritics on computers and typewriters. Some have their own keys; some are created by first pressing the key with the diacritic mark followed by the letter to place it on. Such a key is sometimes referred to as a <b>dead</b> <b>key,</b> as it produces no output of its own but modifies the output of the key pressed after it.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>dead</b> <b>key</b> is {{a special}} kind of a {{modifier}} key that, instead of being held while another key is struck, is pressed and released before the other key.

[...] For example, on some keyboard layouts, the grave accent key [...] is a dead key; in this case, striking [...] and then [...] results in à (a with grave accent), whereas [...] followed by [...] results in è (e with grave accent).

2500|$|A Compose key can be {{characterized}} as a generic <b>dead</b> <b>key</b> that may in some systems be available instead of or in addition to the more specific dead keys. It allows access {{to a wide range of}} predefined extra characters by interpreting a whole sequence of keystrokes following it. For example, striking [...] followed by [...] (apostrophe) and then [...] results in á (a with acute accent), [...] followed by [...] and then [...] results in æ (ae ligature), and [...] followed by [...] and then [...] results in © (circled c, copyright symbol).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the absence}} of a default <b>dead</b> <b>key,</b> even a normal {{printing}} key can temporarily be altered to function as a <b>dead</b> <b>key</b> by simultaneously holding down another modifier key (typically AltGr or Option).

50|$|The diacritical marks {{contained}} in the common secondary group act as <b>dead</b> <b>keys,</b> i.e. {{they are to be}} entered before the base characters they apply to.

50|$|This chained <b>dead</b> <b>key</b> {{behavior}} is toggled by the <b>dead</b> <b>key</b> flag, {{which is the}} fourth argument of the DEADTRANS function (after the base character code, the diacritic code, and the composed character code). If this flag is set to its default value zero, the composed character is inserted; if it is set to one, the composed character code is handled as another diacritic code like those due to <b>dead</b> <b>key</b> presses, and occurs typically as a second argument in other deadlist entries.|$|E
50|$|A <b>dead</b> <b>key</b> is {{a special}} kind of a {{modifier}} key on a mechanical typewriter, or computer keyboard, that is typically used to attach a specific diacritic to a base letter. The <b>dead</b> <b>key</b> does not generate a (complete) character by itself, but modifies the character generated by the key struck immediately after. Thus, a dedicated key is not needed for each possible combination of a diacritic and a letter, but rather only one <b>dead</b> <b>key</b> for each diacritic is needed, in addition to the normal base letter keys.|$|E
