40|$|Controller {{performance}} {{assessment of}} SISO and MIMO systems requires effective and systematic <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> associated system models based on closed-loop data. In this work, a new methodology for <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process, controller and disturbance models is presented for <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> enabling <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> MIMO control systems. The methodology {{is based on}} subspace identification algorithms for <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controller, process and disturbance models from closed-loop data. However, <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process model is enhanced by <b>the</b> estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> associated interactor matrix via the Variable Regression Estimation technique, <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> which is mathematically proved.

40|$|The paper, {{which is}} a summary of a longer study, {{presents}} the most important conceptual and methodological approaches to <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> needs for adult education. The conceptual approaches are related to <b>the</b> theoretical treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> needs, such as the behaviourist and development-humanist theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> needs applied in psychology, the class-strata needs theory developed by sociologists, {{and an understanding of}} the needs characteristic of marketing. A special chapter considers <b>the</b> applicability <b>of</b> individual conceptual approaches to <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> needs for adult education within higher education. A consequence of multiplicity of conceptual approaches to <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> needs is a methodological pluralism which becomes evident in empirical work. In the subsequent chapter the author outlines the already established methods for <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> needs and "a case study" carried out by <b>the</b> researchers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Centre for <b>the</b> Development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University.
