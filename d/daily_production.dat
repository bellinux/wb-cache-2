Combined {{with the threat of}} Hurricane Charley, Bonnie forced the evacuation of 154oil platforms and 32oil rigs. The cease in production was equivalent to over 1.2million barrels of loss in crude oil, or 0.2% of the annual oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas reserves were also limited. The lack of gas production due to the storms was equivalent to 7.4% of the total <b>daily</b> <b>production</b> in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

Two cruise ships, the Carnival Glory and a Royal Caribbean ship postponed their docking dates and stayed at sea for a few additional days. The islands of Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy were placed under an orange alert, the second-lowest alert level, and Guadeloupe was placed under a yellow alert, the lowest alert level. In Puerto Rico, officials closed schools and government offices on September4 and opened 433 shelters across the island.

40|$|The motive of {{the study}} is to propose a water-gas {{two-phase}} flow model to depict the characteristics of Coalbed Methane (CBM) transporting in the unsaturated coalbed and predict the production of CBM well. The proposed model is established based on Buckley-Leverett equation. The calculating equations of daily gas and water production of CBM well are derived from the proposed model. A program is achieved based on the equations and an actual CBM well is simulated as an example. The simulated results are verified by the actual site monitoring values. Moreover, the effects of permeability, porosity, well control radius, coalbed thickness and coal-rock matrix radius on the <b>daily</b> gas <b>production</b> and cumulative gas production of CBM well are studied. The comprehensive results address that the equations of <b>daily</b> gas <b>production</b> and cumulative gas production are good agreement with the monitoring values. <b>Daily</b> gas <b>production</b> increases with increasing permeability. Greater porosity means higher initial and stable <b>daily</b> gas <b>production.</b> Appropriate increase of the well control radius can improve the initial and stable <b>daily</b> gas <b>production.</b> However, when the well control radius reaches a critical value, it has no effect on the <b>daily</b> gas <b>production.</b> The initial gas production increases greatly with increasing coalbed thickness and matrix radius...|$|R

25|$|Most Indians {{depend on}} on-site {{sanitation}} facilities which means mainly pit latrines in rural areas. In rural areas, {{the government has}} been promoting community-led sanitation approaches such as the Total Sanitation Campaign, with some success. In urban areas, a good practice example is the Slum Sanitation Program in Mumbai that has provided access to sanitation for a quarter million slum dwellers. Sewerage, where available, is often in a bad state. In Delhi the sewerage network has lacked maintenance over the years and overflow of raw sewage in open drains is common, due to blockage, settlements and inadequate pumping capacities. The capacity of the 17 existing wastewater treatment plants in Delhi is adequate to cater a <b>daily</b> <b>production</b> of waste water of less than 50% of the drinking water produced.
