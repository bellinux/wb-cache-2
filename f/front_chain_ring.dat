50|$|In {{the case}} of {{derailleur}} gears the chain is usually long enough {{so that it can}} be shifted onto the largest <b>front</b> <b>chain</b> <b>ring</b> and the largest rear sprocket without jamming, and not so long that, when shifted onto the smallest <b>front</b> <b>chain</b> <b>ring</b> and the smallest rear sprocket, the rear derailleur cannot take up all the slack. Meeting both these requirements is only possible if the rear derailleur is compatible with the gear range being used on the bike. It is broadly accepted as inadvisable to actually use the large/large and small/small gear combinations due to chain stress and wear.|$|E

40|$|A simple {{model of}} the bicycle drive system with a non-circular <b>front</b> <b>chain</b> <b>ring</b> is {{proposed}} and an algorithm is devised for calculation of the corresponding Gear Ratio As a Function Of Crank Angle (GRAFOCA). It is shown that the true effective radius of the chain ring is always the perpendicular distance between the crank axis and the line through the chain segment between the chain ring and the cog. It is illustrated that the true effective radius of the chain ring at any crank angle may differ substantially from the maximum vertical distance between the crank axis and the chain ring circumference that {{is used as a}} proxy for the effective chain ring radius in several studies; in particular, the crank angle at which the effective chain ring radius is maximal as predicted from the latter approach may deviate by as much as 0. 30. rad from the true value. The algorithm proposed may help in designing chain rings that achieve the desired GRAFOCA. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
