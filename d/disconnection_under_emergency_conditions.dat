30|$|In this paper, {{the impact}} of {{different}} blocking failures in an MTDC system after a converter-side AC fault is analyzed with simulation studies. According to the performance and impact on the MTDC, they have been divided into the <b>emergency</b> <b>condition</b> and non-emergency <b>condition.</b> <b>Under</b> the <b>emergency</b> <b>condition,</b> the isolation between the faulted AC and DC sides is not achieved using the normal control and protection strategy. A special control and protection strategy, which achieves both {{the isolation of the}} fault terminal with reducing the fault current and recovery of the other terminals, is proposed. Under the non-emergency condition, a potential risk of overcharging the blocked SMs has been identified. The simulation is conducted using the RTDS.

40|$|The US Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a {{critical}} new tool for medical and public health communities and is applicable for both civilian and military use. It fills the need for timely and practical medical treatment <b>under</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions</b> and authorizes use of the best product available for treatment or prevention when the relevant product has not already been approved or approved for this specifi c use by the US Food and Drug Administration. The need for and genesis of the EUA, its requirements, its broad application to civilian and military populations, and its features of particular importance to physicians and public health offi cials are detailed. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 (Public Law 108 – 276; “the Act”), among other provisions, established the comprehensive Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) program. EUA permits the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve the emergency use of drugs, devices, and medical products (including diagnostics) that were not previously approved, cleared, or licensed by FDA (hereafter, “unapproved”) or the off-label use of approved products in certain well-defined emergency situations.

40|$|A {{system for}} {{emergency}} aircraft control uses {{at least one}} engine and lateral fuel transfer that allows a pilot to regain control over an aircraft <b>under</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions.</b> Where aircraft propulsion is available only through engines {{on one side of}} the aircraft, lateral fuel transfer provides means by which the center of gravity of the aircraft can be moved over to the wing associated with the operating engine, thus inducing a moment that balances the moment from the remaining engine, allowing the pilot to regain control over the aircraft. By implementing the present invention in flight control programming associated with a flight control computer (FCC), control of the aircraft <b>under</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions</b> can be linked to the yoke or autopilot knob of the aircraft. Additionally, the center of gravity of the aircraft can be shifted in order to effect maneuvers and turns by spacing such center of gravity either closer to or farther away from the propelling engine or engines. In an alternative embodiment, aircraft having a third engine associated with the tail section or otherwise are accommodated and implemented by the present invention by appropriately shifting the center of gravity of the aircraft. Alternatively, where a four-engine aircraft has suffered loss of engine control {{on one side of the}} plane, the lateral fuel transfer may deliver the center of gravity closer to the two remaining engines. Differential thrust between the two can then control the pitch and roll of the aircraft in conjunction with lateral fuel transfer...|$|R

Bolstered with tensioned fascia, people are able to perform extraordinary feats of strength and speed <b>under</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>conditions.</b> How fascia contracts is still not well understood, but appears to involve the activity of myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts are fascial cells that are created as a response to mechanical stress. In a two step process, fibroblasts differentiate into proto-myofibroblasts that with continued mechanical stress, become differentiated myofibroblasts. Fibroblasts cannot contract, but myofibroblasts are able to contract in a smooth muscle-like manner.|$|R
