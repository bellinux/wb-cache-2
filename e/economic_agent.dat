40|$|Although the sources, {{extent and}} {{physical}} {{impacts of the}} future climate change are highly uncertain, available dynamic economic assessments implicitly assume that <b>economic</b> <b>agents</b> perfectly know them. Perfect foresight, rational expectations or active learning are standard assumptions underlying simulated results. To the contrary, this paper builds {{on the assumption that}} <b>economic</b> <b>agents</b> may suffer for a while from limited knowledge about the average and variability of physical impacts of climate change. Using a world dynamic and stochastic general equilibrium model, our simulation results show that identifying the average physical impact is much more crucial than its variability. This finding is robust to the level of risk aversion of <b>economic</b> <b>agents.</b> The rate of pure time preference of <b>economic</b> <b>agents</b> more significantly affects the economic impacts.

We observe that when externality does not exist, <b>economic</b> <b>agents</b> (subjects of experimemt) act economically rationally, but when externality exists, <b>economic</b> <b>agents</b> avoid the risk of a regime shift that would have negative consequences for others.

It {{stood in front of}} a small coppice, a creepered, plain-fronted, little brick house, with a garden still full of sunflowers, tenanted by the old jockey, Pettance, his widowed daughter, and her three small children. [...] "That talkative old scoundrel," [...] as Winton always called him, was still {{employed}} in the Mildenham stables, and his daughter was laundress to the establishment. Gyp had secured for Daphne Wing the same free, independent, <b>economic</b> <b>agent</b> who had watched over her own event; the same old doctor, too, was to be the presiding deity. There were no signs of life about the cottage, and she would not stop, too eager to be at home again, to see the old rooms, and smell the old savour of the house, to get to her old mare, and feel its nose nuzzling her for sugar. It was so good to be back once more, feeling strong and well and able to ride. The smile of the inscrutable Markey at the front door was a joy to her, even the darkness of the hall, where a gleam of last sunlight fell across the skin of Winton's first tiger, on which she had so often sunk down dead tired after hunting. Ah, it was nice to be at home! ...|$|E

The model allowed analysis of the direct and indirect effects of the ECB’s money injection policy on the real and financial investments of the <b>economic</b> <b>agents.</b> This study explained how investing and consumption by <b>economic</b> <b>agents</b> is influenced by financial distress and expansion.|$|R
