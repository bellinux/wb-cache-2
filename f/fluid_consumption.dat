Objectives The current pilot study aimed to evaluate the amount, type and frequency of <b>fluids</b> <b>consumption</b> to determine the correlation between three- and seven-day records. Methods This pilot cross-sectional study was done on 30 adult subjects in Ahvaz, Iran during year 2014. Demographic data were collected via a questionnaire and <b>fluids</b> <b>consumption</b> was assessed with a seven days records questionnaire. For data analyses the SPSS 16 software was used.

Total amount and frequency of fluids intake were not significantly different between three and seven-day records (P = 0. 287), (P = 0. 546).

40|$|Abstract. Two-bottle {{preference}} {{tests have}} often been used to make inferences about gustatory thresholds. The validity of such inferences depends {{on the extent to}} which taste differences produce differential <b>fluid</b> <b>consumptions</b> from the bottles. If equal amounts are consumed despite perceived gustatory dissimilarity, inaccurate threshold estimates result. Modifications of common preference-test procedures, interacting with tastant properties and genetic variation, disclosed instances of such non-discrimination among inbred strains of mice. With an hedonically neutral to mildly unpalatable tastant (sodium cyclamate), taste-aversion conditioning yielded lower thresholds. With a palatable tastant (maltose), testing without prior conditioning usually indicated lower thresholds. Descending concentration series produced lower thresholds than ascending concentration series, for both palatable (sucrose) and neutral (cyclamate) tastants. Previous experience with the tastants elevated preference scores, yielding lower thresholds with palatable tastants (sucrose, maltose) and higher thresholds with an unpalatable tastant (sucrose octaacetate). Within-strain discrepancies between thresholds indicated by the different methods were often large (2 — 3 log molar concentration steps). Among-strain differences of comparable magnitude, both in preferences and threshold estimates, were found for sucrose, maltose and cyclamate...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate about packed and unpacked <b>fluid</b> milk <b>consumption</b> and main attributes of milk to which consumer gives preference. For this purpose, we made a questionnaire to collect data from the urban households of Veraval. Close-ended questions were formed for the purpose of data collection. The questionnaire was used to find the consumer preference for the packed and unpacked milk. For this purpose, we select different variables, the consumer takes into consideration before making purchase decision of milk like quality, freshness, price, fat level and easy availability which determine households’ <b>fluid</b> milk <b>consumption</b> choices among packed, unpacked and both packed-unpacked milk consumption choices. Based on the results, 60. 8 % of respondents consumed unpacked fluid milk, 32. 5 % consumed packed fluid milk while 6. 5 % of respondents consumed both unpacked and packed fluid milk. The study also suggest that the consumer always considers different factors like the standard quality of milk, fat level, price, freshness and availability before making a purchase. It means these are various variables which guide or direct the consumer to make the purchase decision.

Here we use a novel quantifiable analysis of <b>fluid</b> <b>consumption</b> and licking behavior along with a battery of motor tests to examine cerebellar and other motor system defects in Ube 3 a deficient mice. Mice with a maternally inherited Ube 3 a deficiency (Ube 3 am 2 /p 1) show defects in <b>fluid</b> <b>consumption</b> behavior which are different from Ube 3 am 2 /p 2 mice. The rhythm of fluid licking and number of licks per visit were significantly different among the three groups (m 2 /p 2, m 2 /p 1, m 1 /p 1) and indicate that not only was <b>fluid</b> <b>consumption</b> dependent on Ube 3 a expression in the cerebellum, but may also depend on low levels of Ube 3 a expression in other brain regions.

Active male subjects (n= 16) performed four trials in random order. The participants arrived to the trials euhydrated and were dehydrated to 2 % of body weight (BW) by cycling intermittently in a controlled climate room (30 - 35 úC). After 30 min of rest, they ingested either W or SD in a volume equivalent to 150 % of BW loss, in 45 min (high rate, R) or 165 min (low rate, L). At the time point coinciding with the end of H, urine samples were collected every 30 min for four hours. BW loss was similar for all trials and resulted in a total <b>fluid</b> <b>consumption</b> of 2. 48 + 0. 4 l.
