500|$|Bates {{suggested}} {{closing the}} eyes for {{minutes at a}} time to help bring about relaxation. He asserted that the relaxation could be deepened in most cases by [...] "palming", or covering the closed eyes with the palms of the hands, without putting pressure on the eyeballs. If the covered <b>eyes</b> <b>did</b> not strain, he said, they would see [...] "a field so black {{that it is impossible to}} remember, imagine, or see anything blacker", since light was excluded by the palms. However, he reported that some of his patients experienced [...] "illusions of lights and colors" [...] sometimes amounting to [...] "kaleidoscopic appearances" [...] as they [...] "palmed", occurrences he attributed to his ubiquitous [...] "strain" [...] and that he claimed disappeared when one truly relaxed. This phenomenon, however, was almost certainly caused by Eigengrau or [...] "dark light". In fact, even in conditions of perfect darkness, as inside a cave, neurons at every level of the visual system produce random background activity that is interpreted by the brain as patterns of light and color.|$|E
500|$|The largest known Tarbosaurus skull is {{more than}} [...] long, larger than all other tyrannosaurids except Tyrannosaurus. The skull was tall, like that of Tyrannosaurus, but not as wide, {{especially}} towards the rear. The unexpanded rear of the skull meant that Tarbosaurus <b>eyes</b> <b>did</b> not face directly forwards, suggesting that it lacked the binocular vision of Tyrannosaurus. Large fenestrae (openings) in the skull reduced its weight. Between 58 and 64 teeth lined its jaws, slightly more than in Tyrannosaurus but fewer than in smaller tyrannosaurids like Gorgosaurus and Alioramus. Most of its teeth were oval in cross section, although {{the teeth of the}} premaxilla {{at the tip of the}} upper jaw had a D-shaped cross section. This heterodonty is characteristic of the family. The longest teeth were in the maxilla (upper jaw bone), with crowns up to 85 millimeters (3.3 in) long. In the lower jaw, a ridge on the outer surface of the angular bone articulated with the rear of the dentary bone, creating a locking mechanism unique to Tarbosaurus and Alioramus. Other tyrannosaurids lacked this ridge and had more flexibility in the lower jaw.|$|E

[...] Rabbi Judah ben Rabbi Simon taught that while Adam lay a shapeless mass before God, God showed Adam every succeeding generation of mankind and its Sages, judges, scribes, interpreters, and leaders. God told Adam, in the words of [...] "Your <b>eyes</b> <b>did</b> see unformed substance," [...] Adam's potential descendants, and God told Adam that all of those descendants had already been written in the book of Adam, as [...] says: [...] "This is the book of the generations of Adam." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unlike his {{comic book}} counterpart, Snake <b>Eyes</b> <b>did</b> {{not play a}} major role in the Sunbow's [...] TV series, with the {{exception}} of the first miniseries [...] "The M.A.S.S. Device", where some of his origins were explored. He was always portrayed as a trusted and loyal teammate, and even proved to have a sense of humor, as seen when he broke into a break-dancing routine on-stage, and later in a disguise resembling Boy George in the [...] "Pyramid of Darkness" [...] miniseries. In the first miniseries, Snake Eyes appeared in his [...] "V1" [...] uniform, but for all of his later appearances he wore a bluish-grey version of his [...] "V2" [...] uniform. Additionally, he does not have a rivalry with Storm Shadow in the cartoon, who instead fights with such characters as Spirit and Quick Kick. Although Snake Eyes does not speak, the vocal effects of Snake Eyes' wolf Timber were provided by Frank Welker.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} God created {{humanity}} {{from one person}} in [...] to teach that Providence considers one who destroys a single person as one who has destroyed an entire world, and Providence considers one who saves a single person as one who has saved an entire world. And God created humanity from one person {{for the sake of}} peace, so that none can say that their ancestry is greater than another's. And God created humanity from one person so that heretics cannot say that there are many gods who created several human souls. And God created humanity from one person to demonstrate God's greatness, for people stamp out many coins with one coin press and they all look alike, but God stamped each person with the seal of Adam, and not one of them is like another. Therefore, every person is obliged to say, [...] "For my sake the world was created.". It was taught in a Baraita that Rabbi Meir used to say that the dust of the first man (from which [...] reports God made Adam) was gathered {{from all parts of the}} earth, for [...] says of God, [...] "Your <b>eyes</b> <b>did</b> see my unformed substance," [...] and [...] says, [...] "The eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the whole earth.".|$|E
