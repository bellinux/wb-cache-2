25|$|Along with François Couperin, Rameau {{is one of}} the two {{masters of}} the French school of {{harpsichord}} music in the 18th century. Both composers made a decisive break with the style of the first generation of harpsichordists, who confined their compositions to the relatively <b>fixed</b> <b>mould</b> of the classical suite. This reached its apogee {{in the first decade of}} the 18th century with successive collections of pieces by Louis Marchand, Gaspard Le Roux, Louis-Nicolas Clérambault, Jean-François Dandrieu, Elisabeth Jacquet de la Guerre, Charles Dieupart, and Nicolas Siret.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{roll forming}} {{production}} line with <b>fixed</b> <b>mould</b> and moving roll of variable cross-section is a hydromechatronics line that implements the automatic processing of vehicle parts. Some technical problems of mass production of complicated cross section parts {{can be solved}} successfully by the production line, such as the low stability, the uncontrolled dimensional accuracy and the sheet deformation while a variable cross-section is cut off. The control system for the complete production line mainly consists of these parts: Siemens Simotion D 455 - 2 motion control system, IPC, touch screen, ET 200 M input and output modules and so on. In order to develop the control system for the production line, the article completed system general design, full-closed loop control structure design and software design. It also completed building of hardware platform, development of software system and research of interpolation algorithm. Through several experimental verifications, the control system for the production line can meet the requirement of actual production...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, authors {{present a}} highly {{flexible}} tooling {{system based on}} reconfigurable multi-point thermoforming (MPTF) methodology, which has been developed within an EU-granted FP 7 project. The MPTF technology employs an actuated-punch matrix to dynamically configure a controllable tool working surface through digitally adjusting relative displacement of each punch in the matrix. Novel MPTF methods have been proposed through re-changing configurations of actuated-punch tooling system according to rapid thermoforming principles and relevant cladding applications. The tooling system includes an industrial-scale prototype of an MPTF tooling integrated with functional CAD/CAE/CAT software interfaces. The numerical simulation with an explicit FEM predicts the unexpected deformation defects of dimples and wrinkles regarding to discrete contact boundaries between punches and the sheet blank. Innovative techniques of variable blank-holder and deformable cushion have been implemented to suppress wrinkling and eliminate dimpling effectively. The tooling system has been successfully applied to manufacture complex double-curved panels, which are described as application examples. Compared with conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>moulds,</b> the flexible tooling offers robust, rapid and re-changeable means to make mould-less manufacturing large freeform panels...|$|R
2500|$|Ariel, {{launched}} in 1865. She {{was thought to}} be the fastest of her day, being designed for excellent performance in light winds. The downside to this was that in a strong gale, sail had to be reduced rapidly or the ship even hove to, as her extreme lines left her susceptible to being pooped or, if going to windward, damage would be caused by waves sweeping the deck. She was of composite construction (wooden planking on an iron framework), built at the yard of Robert Steele & Co in Greenock on the Clyde. She carried 100 tons of <b>fixed</b> iron ballast, <b>moulded</b> to fit low in the hull and a further 20 tons of moveable iron ballast. This gives an indication of the [...] "yacht like" [...] nature of her design.|$|R
40|$|A {{new process}} of {{combining}} gas injection with compression moulding {{was developed and}} studied in this research work. The process is called Gas Assisted Compression Moulding (or GasComp). The principle {{is based on the}} injection of nitrogen gas during a conventional compression moulding cycle. The flow of the material due to the compressive force of the press is assisted by the injection of gas into the centre of the molten material. The gas assists in the flow by coring out the material, reducing the weight by up to 45 percent and increasing the dimensional stability of the component. Novel glass matt thermoplastic mould tools were designed and developed {{during the course of the}} research program for use with the process. These designs were of a flash compression mould tool design with a horizontal clamping face, rather than the conventional positive plug compression mould tool with a vertical shear edge. This created a <b>fixed</b> volume <b>mould</b> tool, which when used in conjunction with a short shot of material, would allow the gas to flow the material to fill the remaining volume. Several materials were investigated for their suitability with the process. Their characterisation showed that they contained different glass fibre contents and architectures. A material with a short, dispersed glass fibre content of 11 percent proved to consistently contain a significant gas cavity. The glass architecture proved to be the most significant contributing factor in the creation of a successful gas cavity. The most significant processing parameter in the creation of a large volume cavity proved to be the gas injection delay time. The gas pressure and gas ramp time affected the cavity shape, length and extent of gas fingering. The shrinkage was reduced in the presence of a gas cavity, along with the visible reduction of sink marks. The presence of other moulding features, such as hesitation marks, gas packing and the change in fibre orientation were also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Polyethylene (PE) wear is the {{limiting}} {{factor for the}} longevity of a conventional total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Excessive wear leads to loosening and even - tual implant failure. The aim of our in vitro {{study was to investigate}} wear of a PE tibial insert on a rotating platform as compared to the same insert fixed to the tibial baseplate and articulating with a similar femoral component. All tests were performed at Endolab Laboratories, Rosenheim, Germany using a knee joint simulator following ISO 14243 - 1. Three specific configurations were tested and compared to a loaded soak control : (1) the rotating platform using machined polyethylene (PE), (2) fixed bearing using machined PE, (3) fixed bearing using compressionmoulded PE. Calf serum with a high protein concentration of 30 g/l was chosen as test lubricant. PE wear was measured gravimetrically using the ISO 14243 - 2 protocol. The total wear rates found for all systems tested were low. The mean wear rate was 1. 40 mg per million cycles for the <b>moulded</b> <b>fixed</b> bearing, 4. 07 mg per million cycles for the machined fixed bearing type and 0. 82 mg per million cycles for the machined rotating platform bearing type. We conclude that the TKA system we tested (Performance®, Biomet, Warsaw, IND, USA) demonstrated very low gravimetric wear. The wear rate of the same implant in the fixed mode compared to the rotating platform mode was four times higher. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The body of {{knowledge}} on transport and land use planning shows considerable overlap with management theories and practices. Notable examples {{can be found in}} project management and strategic management. Recently, in the field of management theory, the idea of programme management has gained prominence in response to the need to coordinate on a tactical level. Programme management links to both strategic management and project management, as it focuses on the coordinated management of related projects in order to realize strategic objectives. In line with the tradition to integrate management theories into spatial planning, the aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the power of a programme management approach in a transport and land use planning context. We investigate whether and how a programme management approach when applied in transport and land use planning can deal with three important interrelated challenges that emerge between the strategic and operational level in transport and land use planning: (1) linking strategic goals to operational projects, (2) developing the accompanying joint organizational structures, and (3) <b>moulding</b> <b>fixed</b> and separate procedures into more adaptive joint decision-making processes. To do so, we conducted an in-depth case study of two recent programme management approaches in Dutch transport and land use planning. We show that both programmes function as platforms where different parties come together and where a wide range of management and monitoring tools are used to guide the programme in a specific direction. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the effect of particle content and grain size of Sokka roof tile powder on the burning endurance of the composite of Sokka roof tile powder - ripoxy R- 802. The materials used were a Sokka roof tile powder (SGS), ripoxy R- 802 resin, MEKPO catalyst and P-EX promotor. The Sokka roof tile powder was generated from the rejected Sokka roof tile which was crushed into powder. The powder was sieved to result in three size variances, which were mesh 80 retained in mesh 100 (177 μm- 149 μm), mesh 150 retained in mesh 200 (99 μm- 74 μm), and breaking away from mesh 200 (≤ 74 μm). Prior to getting mixed with the resin, SGS was heated in an oven for 45 minutes in the temperature of 105 oC. Afterwards, the powder was mixed with ripoxy R- 802 resin for 3 minutes. The variances of SGS content were determined to be 10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 % composition. Making composite was conducted by press <b>mould.</b> <b>Fixed</b> composites was given post curing treatment in the temperatures of 80 oC for 120 minutes. The burning testing on the composite was conducted {{on the basis of the}} standard of ASTM D- 635. The indicator of burning endurance was determined by the data of time of burning (TOB) and rate of burning (ROB). The TOB resulted from the time of ignition and the ROB resulted from the time of fire propagation time in the composite. The results of this research are as follows: (1) the addition of SGS can improve the burning endurance of the composite of SGS-ripoxy R- 802 as indicated by the increase in the TOB but the decrease of ROB due to the addition of the content of SGS; (2) the small size of the particle of SGS can increase the burning endurance of the composite of SGS-ripoxy R- 802 as signified by the increase in the TOB but the decrease in the ROB due to the small size of the particle of SGS which breaks away from mesh 200 (≤ 74 μm) ...|$|R
