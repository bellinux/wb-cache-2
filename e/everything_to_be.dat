25|$|Animism is not {{the same}} as pantheism, {{although}} the two are sometimes confused. Some religions are both pantheistic and animistic. One of the main differences is that while animists believe <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> spiritual in nature, they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united (monism), the way pantheists do. As a result, animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul. In pantheism, everything shares the same spiritual essence, rather than having distinct spirits and/or souls.|$|E
25|$|Most {{sources say}} that Democritus {{followed}} {{in the tradition of}} Leucippus and that they carried on the scientific rationalist philosophy associated with Miletus. Both were thoroughly materialist, believing <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the result of natural laws. Unlike Aristotle or Plato, the atomists attempted to explain the world without reasoning as to purpose, prime mover, or final cause. For the atomists questions of physics should be answered with a mechanistic explanation ("What earlier circumstances caused this event?"), while their opponents search for explanations which, in addition to the material and mechanistic, also included the formal and teleological ("What purpose did this event serve?").|$|E

Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos series of surreal horror stories, and applied similar themes into the game. Miyazaki had {{wanted to create a}} game set in such an era as those novels, but he wanted <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as detailed as possible, and felt that such a game was only possible on eighth generation hardware. This need for high-end hardware, {{and the fact that the}} PlayStation 4 was presented to the company first, was the reason the game was a PS4 exclusive, rather than a cross-generation release. The developers' target framerate for the title was 30 frames per second, due to their design choices made for the title.|$|E
25|$|The Nord-100 was {{introduced}} in 1979, which was specialized at flexibility and focused on administrative applications. When Digital launched their VAX-11 in 1977, Norsk Data had the Nord-5 32-bit computer ready for CERN. As the VAX-11 was 32-bit and regarded as a superminicomputer, Norsk Data did not initially {{see it as a}} competitor since the Nord-5 had much better processing power. Nord-50 had similar processing power to the Nord-5, but was not a general-purpose computer. The 32 bit computer used a Nord-10 front processor that ran the SINTRAN III operating system. Development of the ND-500 started in 1978 and had so fundamental changes to the system architecture (was not made from bit-slice components but microprammed with a new instruction set) that all software had to be rewritten - except for the SINTRAN. The computer was launched in 1981, but with fundamental shortcomings imposed by the OS It was much faster than the VAX, but did not meet the general customers' expectation of being a multi-purpose computer. Later models improved the performance and tweaking of the system allowed it to become a multipurpose system.at the performance of a special purpose super computer as sold by Cray. A major contract with the ND-500 was the Joint European Torus project, which took delivery of twenty-seven ND-100 and -500 units. Development of the ND-5000 started before the ND-500 was completed. The design was changed to become more modular; this increased the development costs, but reduced production costs and increased scalability. On the ND5000, components were placed in cards that were interconnected, initially to simplify cooling but also to enable the high clock frequency If an electric current is switched at a clock frequency of 1GHz, it travel about one foot per cycle, so 10cm is a delay of a clock cycle at 3GHz. The ND-500 computers had timing problems caused by wire-distance, and going faster just required <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> close.|$|E

500|$|Days {{before the}} release of the Big Wish Movie, Scholastic Press {{published}} a Care Bears storybook based on the film; it was written by Sonia Sander and illustrated by Jay Johnson. [...] One scene in the book involves Wish Bear and the three new Bears grocery shopping; this does not appear in the film. [...] Later in the book, when Messy Bear wishes for <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> like it used to be, it causes the Bears to travel back to the age of the dinosaurs; in the film, Twinkers just turns Messy Bear into Messy Cub.|$|E
500|$|Everyone {{is pleased}} to welcome the new {{neighbours}} at first, but things soon get out of control. [...] The new bears unwittingly make a huge mess of everything (especially when the huge mansion they asked for causes pollution). Then, after a confrontation with them at a picnic ("Get a Lot") Wish Bear accidentally wishes Twinkers away to the new bears; they soon abuse the star's power with an amusement park focusing on Me Bear, a mud pie for Messy Bear, and a huge noisy motorcycle for Too Loud Bear. [...] Once the new bears finally realise their problem, they try to fix it with more wishes, but to no availCare-a-lot becomes a blank white space (wishing {{that all of this}} was gone), the bears begin to glow in color (wishing for <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> back how it was, but with more color), Grumpy Bear turns black and white (wishing for less color), and Messy Bear turns into Messy Cub (wishing for <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> like it used to be). [...] When they try to wish Twinkers back to Wish Bear, the star ultimately loses his power from exhaustion (because they had been pushing him much too hard). [...] Wish Bear uses Grumpy Bear's rocket to bring him to the Big Wish, a grandmother star, in the sky. Big Wish restores his power, but not before Wish Bear assures her that she has learned her lesson, which is wishing is fun, but it is far more important to work hard to achieve your dreams.|$|E

500|$|Johann Peter Hebel {{was born}} on 10 May 1760 in Basel, where his parents were {{employed}} in a patrician household during the summer. He spent half of his childhood in Basel {{and the other half}} in the village of Hausen im Wiesental, where his father worked as a weaver during the winters. As he wrote in an autobiographical sketch, [...] "there I learned early on {{what it meant to be}} poor and rich... to have nothing and to have <b>everything,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> happy with the happy people and to be sad with those who cried". Memories of both places had a deep influence on his literary work. Hebel's father, who had moved to southern Baden from the Hunsrück area, died of typhus early in 1761, as did his younger sister, who was only a few weeks old. Hebel went to primary school in Hausen in 1766, and in 1769 went on to the Latin school in Schopfheim, where his teacher was the theologian August Gottlieb Preuschen. During the summer months he went to a parish school in Basel, and later to the prestigious cathedral school (Gymnasium am Münsterplatz). His mother died when he was thirteen.|$|E
500|$|In the Grand Prix, Max Verstappen broke several records: {{apart from}} being the {{youngest}} ever driver to win a race at 18 years and 228 days, he also was the youngest to stand on a Formula One podium, in both instances breaking Sebastian Vettel's record set at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix by more than two years. Vettel had been 21 years and 2 months at the time. Verstappen also became the youngest driver to lead at least one lap of a Grand Prix, again overcoming a record set by Vettel, at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix. Verstappen also was the first driver born in the 1990s to win a Grand Prix. He received considerable praise after the race, with Sky Sports F1's David Croft saying that he [...] "has shown he has <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a world champion". His father Jos Verstappen, himself a former Grand Prix driver, declared that he considered his son a better driver than himself, as race wins had eluded him during his own career in the sport. French sport newspaper L'Équipe declared Verstappen to be [...] "already a great" [...] and [...] "in the big leagues". Verstappen {{was also the first}} Dutchman to win a race, with the Netherlands becoming the 22nd country to produce a race winner. He was the tenth different winner of the Spanish Grand Prix in as many past editions.|$|E

500|$|Dónde Están los Ladrones? {{comprises}} Latin pop {{and rock}} en Español styles. The album opens with [...] "Ciega, Sordomuda", which is musically filled by typical Mexican trumpets over a disco dance loop and an electric guitar. Second track [...] "Si Te Vas" [...] lyrically depicts an angry Shakira who tells her lover [...] "Si me cambias por esa bruja, pedazo de cuero, no vuelvas nunca más, que no estaré aquí". The next song, [...] "Moscas en la Casa", {{was inspired by}} the singer's troubled relationship with Puerto Rican actor Osvaldo Ríos. Shakira lyrically expresses the sadness that she feels after a broken relationship. [...] "Mis días sin ti son tan oscuros, tan largos, tan grises, mis días sin ti", she sings. In the next track [...] "No Creo", the singer expresses how she believes in nothing and nobody except her lover. The song references popular socially accepted or non-accepted norms such as herself, luck, Karl Marx, Jean-Paul Sartre, Venus and Mars, and Brian Weiss. The fifth song on Dónde Están los Ladrones? is [...] "Inevitable". Lyrically, in the hard rock ballad, Shakira confesses that she does not know how to prepare coffee, does not understand soccer, that she must have been unfaithful at some point and that she never wears watch. The next track [...] "Octavo Día" [...] is a rock-oriented song that refers to God coming to Earth after finishing his work and discovering <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in ruins, and decides to quit his job and become a normal man.

[...] At {{the time of its}} recording, expectations in the hip hop scene were high for Illmatic.

[...] AZ recounted recording on the album, [...] "I got on Nas' album and did the 'Life's a Bitch' song, but even then I thought I was terrible on it, to be honest. But once people started hearing that and liking it, that's what built my confidence. I thought, 'OK, I can probably do this.' That record was <b>everything.</b> <b>To</b> <b>be</b> the only person featured on Illmatic when Nas {{is considered one of the}} top men in New York at that time, one of the freshest new artists, that was big."

500|$|Frusciante's {{approach}} to album composition has changed. On his early recordings, he welcomed sonic imperfections, noting that [...] "even on [...] there are off-pitch vocals and out-of-tune guitars." [...] However, on later albums such as Shadows Collide With People, he pursued the opposite: [...] "I just wanted <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> perfect—I didn't want anything off pitch, or off time, or any unintentional this or that." [...] Frusciante views songwriting as taking time, {{and does not}} force it: [...] "If a song wants to come to me, I'm always ready to receive it, but I don't work at it." [...] Much of his solo material is first written on an acoustic or unamplified electric guitar. He also prefers to record his albums on analog tapes and other relatively primitive equipment. This preference stems from his belief that older equipment can actually speed up the recording process, and that modern computerized recording technology gives only an illusion of efficiency. Frusciante tries to streamline the recording process as much as possible, because he thinks [...] "music comes alive when [...] are creating it fast". He also enjoys the challenge of having to record something in very few takes, and believes that when musicians are unable to handle the pressure of having to record something quickly they often get frustrated or bogged down by perfectionism. With his focus on new styles of music, Frusciante describes having worked with the computer as an instrument, and having found the ability to merge old and new production techniques together. He has noted {{that there has been}} a change in how he works on an album. In the past he would work on one song at a time, but with the new [...] "Progressive Synth Pop" [...] that he has been working on, he feels much more comfortable to work within the album as a whole. He currently uses the music tracker Renoise as his main Digital audio workstation along with some drum machines, sequencers, and other hardware, along with his Doepfer, Arp, and other modular synthesizers.|$|E
