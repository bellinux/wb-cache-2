500|$|Today {{the city}} is unrecognisable. The houses with their roofs {{lying on the ground}} look like gravestones. Parts of the rubble are covered with fresh <b>earth</b> <b>furrowed</b> by {{bulldozer}} tracks. Everywhere there are fragments of furniture, discarded kitchen utensils, Hebrew newspapers dating from the first week of June; here a ripped-up mattress, there the springs of an old sofa. On the few sections of wall still standing, Hebrew inscriptions proclaim: [...] "There'll be another round"; [...] "You want Quneitra, you'll have it destroyed." ...|$|R

60|$|But, as {{he stood}} in the grassy Valley, he saw that to turn up the <b>earth</b> in <b>furrows</b> would be to destroy {{hundreds}} of pretty, helpless flowers, as well as thousands of the tender blades of grass. And this he could not bear to do.|$|R
50|$|Timothy Lee Barnwell (born February 17, 1955) is an American author, {{commercial}} photographer, {{and fine}} art photographer based in Asheville, NC. He {{has worked as}} a photojournalist and had images published in numerous publications including Time, Newsweek, Mother Jones, Billboard, LensWork, National Parks, American Craft, Astronomy, Outdoor Photographer, and B&W magazine. In 1981 he founded Appalachian Photographic Workshops and served as Director and photography instructor until in closed in 1988. He is the author of five books, The Face of Appalachia: Portraits from the Mountain Farm (W.W. Norton/NY, 2003); On <b>Earth's</b> <b>Furrowed</b> Brow: The Appalachian Farm in Photographs (W.W. Norton/NY, 2007); Hands in Harmony: Traditional Crafts and Music in Appalachia (W.W. Norton/NY, 2009); Blue Ridge Parkway Vistas: A Comprehensive Identification Guide to What You See From the Many Overlooks (Numinous Editions,2014),and Great Smoky Mountains Vistas: A Guide, with Mountain Peak Identifications, for What to See and Do In and Around the National Park (Numinous Editions, 2016).|$|R
25|$|It is up {{to farmers}} to get the water from {{distribution}} channels to their crops for irrigation. There are different methods to do this; any one {{or a combination of}} <b>earth</b> distribution channel, <b>furrow,</b> and drip tubes can be used.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} was the bow ard, {{which consists}} of a draft-pole (or beam) pierced by a thinner vertical pointed stick called the head (or body), with one end being the stilt (handle) {{and the other a}} share (cutting blade) that was dragged through the topsoil to cut a shallow furrow ideal for most cereal crops. The ard does not clear new land well, so hoes or mattocks must be used to pull up grass and undergrowth, and a hand-held, coulter-like ristle could be used to cut deeper furrows ahead of the share. Because the ard leaves a strip of undisturbed <b>earth</b> between the <b>furrows,</b> the fields are often cross-ploughed lengthwise and widthwise, and this tends to form squarish fields (Celtic fields). The ard is best suited to loamy or sandy soils that are naturally fertilised by annual flooding, as in the Nile Delta and Fertile Crescent, {{and to a lesser extent}} any other cereal-growing region with light or thin soil. By the late Iron Age, ards in Europe were commonly fitted with coulters.|$|R
40|$|Micro-basin tillage is a {{soil and}} water {{conservation}} practice that requires building individual <b>earth</b> blocks along <b>furrows.</b> In this study, plot experiments were conducted to assess the efficiency of micro-basin tillage on sloping croplands between 2012 and 2013 (5 °and 7 °). The conceptual, optimal, block interval model was used to design micro-basins which are meant to capture the maximum amount of water per unit area. Results indicated that when compared to the up-down slope tillage, micro-basin tillage could increase soil water content and maize yield by about 45 % and 17 %, and reduce runoff, sediment and nutrients loads by about 63 %, 96 % and 86 %, respectively. Meanwhile, micro-basin tillage could reduce the peak runoff rates and delay the initial runoff-yielding time. In addition, micro-basin tillage with the optimal block interval proved to be the best one among all treatments with different intervals. Compared with treatments of other block intervals, the optimal block interval treatments increased soil moisture by around 10 % and reduced runoff rate by around 15 %. In general, micro-basin tillage with optimal block interval represents an effective {{soil and water}} conservation practice for sloping farmland of the black soil region...|$|R
50|$|Some ancient hoes, {{like the}} Egyptian mr, were pointed and {{strong enough to}} clear rocky soil and make seed drills, {{which is why they}} are called hand-ards. However, the {{domestication}} of oxen in Mesopotamia and the Indus valley civilization, perhaps as early as the 6th millennium BC, provided mankind with the draft power necessary to develop the larger, animal-drawn true ard (or scratch plough). The earliest was the bow ard, which consists of a draft-pole (or beam) pierced by a thinner vertical pointed stick called the head (or body), with one end being the stilt (handle) and the other a share (cutting blade) that was dragged through the topsoil to cut a shallow furrow ideal for most cereal crops.
