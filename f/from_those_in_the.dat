5|$|Several phylogenetic studies, {{based on}} {{morphological}} characters and mitochondrial DNA sequences, have established the sister species {{relationship between the}} porbeagle and the salmon shark (L.ditropis), which occurs in place {{of it in the}} North Pacific. The genus Lamna evolved 65–45 Ma. When its two extant species diverged from each other is uncertain, though the precipitating event was likely the formation of the ice cap over the Arctic Ocean, which would have isolated sharks in the North Pacific <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} genetically {{discrete}} subpopulations {{have been identified}} across the northern range of the Pacific angelshark. Several subpopulations exist along the coast from Point Conception northward to Alaska. In the Southern California Bight, {{there are at least}} three separate subpopulations off the mainland and northern and southern Channel Islands. The subpopulation along the Pacific coast of Baja California are distinct <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of California. These subpopulations have diverged from one another over time because Pacific angelsharks do not undertake long migratory movements outside of their preferred home areas, and deep waters serve as effective geographical barriers to population mixing. Heterozygosity, a measure of genetic diversity, is higher in the Pacific angelshark than in other shark species that have been examined.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{has also}} revealed two distinct lineages within this species, one occupying the western Atlantic {{and the other}} occupying the eastern Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. This suggests that Indo-Pacific blacktip sharks are descended <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern Atlantic, while the western Atlantic sharks became isolated by the widening Atlantic Ocean {{on one side and}} the formation of the Isthmus of Panama on the other. Blacktip sharks from these two regions differ in morphology, coloration, and life history characteristics, and the eastern Atlantic lineage may merit species status. Fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in Early Miocene (2316 Ma) deposits in Delaware and Florida.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{microsatellite}} DNA evidence, the sicklefin {{lemon shark}} {{is thought to}} have diverged from its sister species N. brevirostris 1014 million years ago, when the closure of the Tethys Sea separated lemon sharks in the Indian Ocean <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic. The ancestral lemon shark species may have been N. eurybathrodon, the fossilized teeth of which occur in both the United States and Pakistan. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that Negaprion is grouped with the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon) and the sliteye shark (Loxodon) in occupying an intermediate position on the carcharhinid evolutionary tree, between the most basal genera (Galeocerdo, Rhizoprionodon, and Scoliodon) and the most derived (Carcharhinus and Sphyrna).|$|E

The dinosaurs from this formation are sometimes known as Edmontonian, after a land mammal age, and are distinct <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> formations above and below. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is interpreted as having a significant marine influence, due to an encroaching Western Interior Seaway, the shallow sea that covered the midsection of North America {{through much of the}} Cretaceous. H. altispinus may have preferred to stay more landward.|$|E
5|$|The EEF {{had already}} decided to invade Ottoman {{territory}} before the first battle of Gaza, {{on the basis of}} Britain's three major war objectives: to maintain maritime supremacy in the Mediterranean, preserve {{the balance of power in}} Europe, and protect Egypt, India and the Persian Gulf. Despite the EEF's defeats during the first two battles of Gaza (with about 10,000 casualties), Allenby planned an advance into Palestine and the capture of Jerusalem to secure the region and cut off the Ottoman forces in Mesopotamia <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Levant and on the Arabian Peninsula. The capture of Gaza, which dominated the coastal route from Egypt to Jaffa, was a first step towards these aims.|$|E
5|$|The North Group was {{occupied}} from the Terminal Classic {{through to the}} Postclassic.

The group occupies Terraces7 through 9, which follow {{the contours of the}} natural terracing present and show no evidence of significant artificial levelling. In combination with a noted absence of sculptured monuments, the different construction methods and ceramic assemblages associated with this group imply an occupation of the North Group by a new settlement community who arrived in the Late Classic period, most probably K'iche' Maya from the highlands.|$|E

5|$|The {{circulation}} {{patterns in}} the upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus are completely different <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower atmosphere. At altitudes 90–150km the Venusian air moves from the dayside to nightside of the planet, with upwelling over sunlit hemisphere and downwelling over dark hemisphere. The downwelling over the nightside causes adiabatic heating of the air, which forms a warm layer in the nightside mesosphere at the altitudes 90–120km. The temperature of this layer—230K (−43°C) is far higher than the typical temperature found in the nightside thermosphere—100K (−173°C). The air circulated from the dayside also carries oxygen atoms, which after recombination form excited molecules of oxygen in the long-lived singlet state (1Δg), which then relax and emit infrared radiation at the wavelength 1.27μm. This radiation from the altitude range 90–100km is often observed {{from the ground and}} spacecraft. The nightside upper mesosphere and thermosphere of Venus is also the source of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium emissions of CO2 and nitric oxide molecules, which are responsible for the low temperature of the nightside thermosphere.|$|E
5|$|The rebels {{made the}} first move in the war, seizing the {{strategic}} Rochester Castle, owned by Langton but left almost unguarded by the archbishop. John was well prepared for a conflict. He had stockpiled {{money to pay for}} mercenaries and ensured the support of the powerful marcher lords with their own feudal forces, such as William Marshal and Ranulf of Chester. The rebels lacked the engineering expertise or heavy equipment necessary to assault the network of royal castles that cut off the northern rebel barons <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south. John's strategy was to isolate the rebel barons in London, protect his own supply lines to his key source of mercenaries in Flanders, prevent the French from landing in the south-east, and then win the war through slow attrition. John put off dealing with the badly deteriorating situation in North Wales, where Llywelyn the Great was leading a rebellion against the 1211 settlement.|$|E
5|$|To {{some extent}} {{this is due}} to {{geography}} and driver training, but more rigorous impaired driving enforcement and severe penalties in Sweden for driving under the influence may also explain the difference. While it might be argued that highways and vehicles in Sweden are different <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, the U.S. fatality rate is also about double the rate in the Canadian province of Ontario, which experienced 3.6 road fatalities per 1 billion vehicle-km according to preliminary 2014 data. Ontario, which is a vast province of more than 1 million square kilometers, has a similar mix of highway types including congested urban and rural highways. Ontario also has a similar mix of large transport trucks essentially identical to U.S. transport trucks, full-sized pickup trucks, SUVs and passenger cars, although there may be more small cars driven in Ontario compared to the United States. This suggests that differences in fatality rates are due to non-physical factors such as driver behavior.|$|E

5|$|While a few leopard sharks {{have been}} {{documented}} traveling hundreds of kilometers, most individuals tend to remain in a localized area for much of their lives. This low level of dispersal has led to genetic divergence across its range. Seven discrete gene pools have been identified along the Californian coast between Humboldt Bay and San Diego. Of these, the Humboldt Bay subpopulation {{is perhaps the most}} isolated, with the sharks there maturing at a larger size and producing fewer offspring than those from other areas. By contrast, the area around Los Angeles represents a genetic transitional zone between subpopulations whose boundaries are more diffuse. Off Baja California, the leopard sharks on the Pacific side are probably distinct <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern Gulf of California. Although there is equivocal evidence for natal philopatry (returning to one's birthplace to breed) in this species, proximity to established breeding grounds likely contributes to the structuring of these different subpopulations.|$|E

5|$|When the Partisans {{advanced}} into Serbia in March 1944, Partisan {{forces in}} northern Montenegro and the Sandžak {{were reduced to}} one division. To exploit this weakness, Đurišić proposed to the Germans that they launch an offensive operation. Operation Frühlingserwachen was planned for the northern parts of Montenegro and the Sandžak; its primary objective was the capture of Kolašin through concentric attacks launched from Pljevlja, Prijepolje and Pešter. This would permit them to link up with forces advancing from Podgorica {{in the south and}} to drive a wedge through the middle of the Partisan lines. Operation Frühlingserwachen involved an Axis force of about 5,000 men comprising some of Đurišić's forces, the SS Polizei-Selbstschutz-Regiment Sandschak, the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Regiment of the SDK, and two reinforced German motorised companies. The operation began on 9 April; Đurišić's forces briefly seized Berane and Bijelo Polje but were soon beaten back by the Partisans. This reversal consolidated the poor German–Chetnik position in Montenegro; their forces in the south were completely isolated <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north. Chetnik forces and their allies suffered heavy casualties; the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Regiment of the SDK was reduced from 893 men to 350.|$|E
