5|$|Counsel for Chng, de Souza and Wong {{argued that}} {{although}} section 10 of the ISA conferred {{power on the}} Minister of Home Affairs to revoke a direction suspending a <b>detention</b> <b>order,</b> it did not empower him to subsequently re-arrest and re-detain his clients. Since section 10 should be strictly construed in favour of the detainees' liberty, the court could not imply a power of arrest and detention into section 10 when Parliament had not provided for it. The Court of Appeal took the view that once a suspension direction under section 10 is revoked, the original <b>detention</b> <b>order</b> becomes operative again. The power to arrest and detain is conferred by the <b>detention</b> <b>order</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|Once an {{individual}} has been detained, there are administrative processes which the executive is required to follow under sections 9, 11 and 12 of the Act. The detainee is to be informed of the grounds of detention as soon as possible, unless their disclosure is against the national interest. He or she is to be served {{with a copy of}} the <b>detention</b> <b>order</b> as well as the grounds and allegations of fact on which the <b>detention</b> <b>order</b> was made.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{order of}} the Minister for Home Affairs may direct that an {{individual}} be detained {{for up to two}} years. This may be further extended by directions issued by the President for further periods of up to two years at a time. The Minister is empowered with discretion to suspend a <b>detention</b> <b>order,</b> but also has the authority to revoke the suspension at any time, which reactivates the <b>detention</b> <b>order.</b> Detention orders must be reviewed at least once every 12 months by an advisory board which thereafter makes its recommendation to the Minister. If an advisory board recommends the release of a detainee and the Minister disagrees, the President may exercise personal discretion to order the release. The requirement for regular reviews of detention orders does not apply to detainees who are not citizens. When a <b>detention</b> <b>order</b> is extended, the Minister is not required to provide the detainee with the grounds justifying the extension order or give the detainee an opportunity to appeal against the extension.|$|E

Enlisted men could also lose leave or seniority.|$|E
5|$|According to the Court of Appeal, {{the burden}} of proof of {{justifying}} the lawfulness of the appellants' detention was, in the first instance, on the detaining authority. This burden of proof could be discharged by evidence that the President, acting in accordance with advice of the Cabinet or an authorized minister, was satisfied that the detention was necessary for national security purposes, and by the production of the <b>detention</b> <b>order.</b> Once the detaining authority had discharged the initial burden of proof, a burden of proof fell on the appellants to challenge their detention on GCHQ grounds.|$|E

5|$|At {{its sixth}} annual {{convention}} in Vavuniya on 25 May 1958 ITAK resolved {{to launch a}} non-violent campaign of civil disobedience to achieve its goals. In May and June 1958 Ceylon witnessed anti-Tamil rioting. Bandaranaike blamed ITAK for precipitating the violence and banned the party along with the Jathika Vimukthi Peramuna (National Liberation Front). ITAK's leaders, including Chelvanayakam, were arrested on 4 June 1958 as they left Parliament and imprisoned. The ITAK leaders were placed under house arrest which meant that Chelvanayakam could not communicate with the public until late 1958 when the <b>detention</b> <b>order</b> was lifted.|$|E
5|$|Before {{a person}} can be {{detained}} under the ISA, the President must be satisfied that such detention {{is necessary for the}} purposes of national security or public order. This is a precondition for the valid exercise by the Minister for Home Affairs of the power to order the detention. The <b>detention</b> <b>order</b> is supplemented by section 74 of the ISA which empowers the police to arrest and detain any person pending enquiries without a warrant under section 8.|$|E
5|$|Non-citizens {{detained}} {{under the}} ISA {{do not have}} a right to make representations to an advisory board. They may, within two months from the date of the <b>detention</b> <b>order,</b> make written representations to the Minister. The Minister may, but is not bound to, refer the representations to an advisory board. Any decision on such representations by the Minister is final and cannot be called into question in any court. The burden of proving that a person is a citizen lies on the person claiming to be one, and again the Minister's decision on the matter is final.|$|E
25|$|Between 2008 and 2012, {{the average}} number of <b>detention</b> <b>orders</b> issued each year was 43. As of 31 October 2013, there were 209 people {{detained}} under the CLTPA, two-thirds for gang-related activity, a quarter for unlicensed moneylending, and the remainder for drug trafficking and other syndicated crimes.|$|R
50|$|Within Israel, the Defense Minister has the {{authority}} to issue Administrative <b>Detention</b> <b>orders</b> for up to 6 months in cases where there is a reasonable chance that the person harms the security of the state. The same Minister has {{the authority}} to renew such orders. Likewise, the Chief of the General Staff can issue such orders, but valid for only 48 hours. Law enforcement authorities have to show cause within 48 hours (in a hearing behind closed doors). Administrative <b>Detention</b> <b>orders</b> can be appealed to the District Court and, if denied there, to the Supreme Court of Israel. The District Court can annul such orders if it finds the administrative detention occurred for reasons other than security (e.g., common crimes, or the exercise of freedom of expression). Overall supervisory authority on the application of the relevant law rests with the Minister of Justice.|$|R

5|$|The Ottoman Minister of the Interior Talaat Pasha {{gave the}} <b>detention</b> <b>order</b> on 24 April 1915. The {{operation}} commenced at 8 p.m. In Constantinople, {{the action was}} led by Bedri Bey, the Chief of Police of Constantinople. On the night of 24–25 April 1915, in a first wave 235 to 270 Armenian leaders of Constantinople, clergymen, physicians, editors, journalists, lawyers, teachers, politicians, and others were arrested upon an instruction of the Ministry of the Interior. The differences in number {{may be explained by}} the uncertainties of the police as they imprisoned people with the same names.|$|E
5|$|The {{applicant}} then {{appealed to}} the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal construed section 8B(1) {{in accordance with the}} clear legislative intention expressed through the plain wording of the provision. It held that the provision reinstates the legal position laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the law governing judicial review of decisions made or acts done pursuant to the executive's powers under the ISA. In order to determine the law on judicial review of the exercise of executive discretion under the ISA, it is necessary to ascertain the exact decision laid down in Lee Mau Seng. However, the Court declined to opine whether the Lee Mau Seng decision meant that a <b>detention</b> <b>order</b> cannot be challenged on the basis that it was made for reasons completely outside the scope of the ISA. This was because on {{the facts of the case}} it had not been established that the applicant was re-detained for reasons not contemplated by section 8(1) of the ISA and completely unrelated to national security. Notably, the Court did not decide whether section 8B(2) of the ISA precludes it from reviewing a <b>detention</b> <b>order</b> shown to have been made for purposes other than national security, or whether the 1989 amendments to the ISA are outside the scope of the legislative power conferred on Parliament by the amended Article 149 of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The <b>detention</b> <b>order</b> on the ITAK leaders {{was lifted}} in October 1961. As a {{compromise}} the Bandaranaike government proposed the District Councils Bill to devolve powers to districts but following protests from Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists dropped {{the bill in}} June 1964. In 1964, as ITAK started preparing for a second civil disobedience campaign, the government started collapsing. As several SLFP MPs defected to the opposition, the government sough ITAK's support but ITAK chose instead to support the opposition and on 3 December 1964 the government was unable to prove its majority in parliament, precipitating an election.|$|E
5000|$|Lord Pearce gave a dissenting judgment, {{in which}} he {{concluded}} that the <b>detention</b> <b>orders</b> should be upheld under the doctrine of necessity. Although he agreed that the United Kingdom retained full sovereignty over Southern Rhodesia, acts done by the de facto government of the territory should be recognized under the doctrine of necessity if such acts are necessary for [...] "the ordinary orderly running of the country".|$|R
50|$|After the re-arrests, four of {{the detainees}} - Teo Soh Lung, Kenneth Tsang Chi Seng, Wong Souk Yee and Kevin Desmond de Souza - were issued with one-year <b>detention</b> <b>orders.</b> They engaged Anthony Lester and Geoffrey Robertson, Queen's Counsels (QC) from the United Kingdom, {{to apply to the}} High Court for writs of habeas corpus, a legal action that {{requires}} a person under arrest to be brought before a judge to challenge detention lacking sufficient cause or evidence. They were unsuccessful. They then appealed to the Court of Appeal. In a landmark ruling, the Court of Appeal ordered the four detainees to be released but they were immediately re-arrested under new <b>detention</b> <b>orders.</b> The detainees filed fresh applications for writs of habeas corpus, but - with the exception of Teo - later withdrew their applications and were released. Teo's application was dismissed by the High Court after the government amended the Constitution and the Internal Security Act to reverse the Court of Appeal's earlier decision. The amendments were expressed to operate retrospectively.|$|R
50|$|In Aruna Sen v. Government of Bangladesh, {{the court}} set a {{precedent}} for nullifying detentions under the Special Powers Act, 1974. In Abdul Latif Mirza v. Government of Bangladesh, it asserted that natural justice was a well-established part of Bangladeshi law. Unlike Malaysia and Sri Lanka, where subjective satisfaction has been sufficient for <b>detention</b> <b>orders,</b> the Bangladeshi apex court has asserted {{that there must be}} an objective basis to detention without trial.|$|R
5|$|The 1989 {{amendments}} to the ISA were challenged before the High Court in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989). Justice Frederick Arthur Chua held that sections 8B(1) and 8B(2) of the ISA govern judicial review {{in the context of}} that Act, and thus preclude any consideration of the legal position laid down in the obiter remarks of the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze. Therefore, applying the subjective test, the respondents' burden of justifying the legality of the applicant's detention was discharged as the respondents had produced a valid <b>detention</b> <b>order</b> and evidence of the subjective satisfaction of the President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, that the applicant was a risk to national security.|$|E
5|$|Thio Li-ann has {{opined that}} the 1989 {{measures}} taken to limit judicial checks on executive power demonstrate {{a preference for}} non-legal institutional checks. One example of a non-legal institutional check is the requirement under the Constitution and the ISA for an advisory board to hear detainees' representations and recommend to the President whether a <b>detention</b> <b>order</b> should be terminated. Thio argues that such checks are weak and cannot replace judicial review. She contends that since Article149 of the Constitution permits the enactment of repressive laws which contravene constitutional liberties, meaningful restraints {{should be placed on}} the wide discretionary powers under the ISA. Similarly, in Chng Suan Tze, the Court of Appeal rejected the view that the executive's accountability to Parliament is a sufficient safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of power.|$|E
5|$|Before {{a person}} can be {{detained}} under the ISA by the Minister for Home Affairs, the President must be satisfied that such detention {{is necessary for the}} purposes of national security or public order. In the landmark case of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal sought to impose legal limits on the power of preventive detention by requiring the Government to adduce objective facts which justified the President's satisfaction. Two months after the decision, a series of legislative and constitutional amendments was enacted that effectively reversed the Chng Suan Tze decision. These amendments were subsequently confirmed to be valid by the High Court and Court of Appeal in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989–1990), which held it is sufficient for the President to be subjectively satisfied that a detainee is a threat to national security in order for a <b>detention</b> <b>order</b> to be issued under the ISA. Notable ISA cases include Operation Coldstore in 1963 which led to the arrest of some 100 left-wing politicians and trade unionists, including members of the socialist opposition party, the Barisan Sosialis. Chia Thye Poh, an alleged Communist, was detained and subject to other restrictions on his liberty under the ISA from 1966 to 1998. The Chng Suan Tze and Teo Soh Lung cases resulted from a 1987 security operation called Operation Spectrum in which 22 Roman Catholic church and social activists and professionals accused of being members of a Marxist conspiracy were detained under the ISA.|$|E

50|$|Dumont {{later wrote}} in his book Mémoires historiques sur la Louisiane that he left Natchez {{the day before the}} revolt.

25|$|After a <b>detention</b> <b>order</b> {{has been}} made or after its expiry, the Minister may direct that the person be subject to police {{supervision}} for a period not exceeding three years.
