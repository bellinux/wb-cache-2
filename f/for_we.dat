5|$|Kami, Perempoean (Perfected Spelling: Kami, Perempuan; Indonesian <b>for</b> <b>We,</b> the Women) is a 1943 stage play in one act by Armijn Pane. The six-character drama {{revolves}} around {{a conflict between}} two couples, with the women considering the men cowards for not wanting to join the Defenders of the Homeland and the men afraid of how the women will react to them having secretly joined. Despite warnings from the women's mother and father, the men prepare to leave for their training, with their partner's blessings.|$|E
5|$|Wulfstan {{must have}} early on {{garnered}} the favour of powerful men, particularly Æthelred king of England, <b>for</b> <b>we</b> find him personally drafting all royal law codes promulgated under Æthelred's reign from 1005 to 1016. There {{is no doubt}} that Wulfstan had a penchant for law; his knowledge of previous Anglo-Saxon law (both royal and ecclesiastical), as well as ninth-century Carolingian law, was considerable. This surely made him a suitable choice for the king's legal draftsman. But it is also likely that Wulfstan's position as archbishop of York, an important centre in the then politically sensitive northern regions of the English kingdom, made him not only a very influential man in the North, but also a powerful ally for the king and his family in the South. It is indicative of Wulfstan's continuing political importance and savvy that he also acted as legal draftsman for, and perhaps advisor to, the Danish king Cnut, who took England's West Saxon throne in 1016.|$|E

Academically, the school regularly outperforms public schools in rich Boston suburbs, particularly as measured by the yearly MCAS assessment required of all Massachusetts public schools.

25|$|In {{consequence}} of rejecting, at the wish of the Romans, a marriage with Laodice V {{the sister of}} Demetrius I Soter, the latter made war upon him, and brought forward Orophernes of Cappadocia, his brother {{and one of the}} supposititious sons of the late king, as a claimant of the throne. Ariarathes was deprived of his kingdom, and fled to Rome about 158 BC. He was restored by the Romans, who, however, allowed Orophernes to reign jointly with him, as is expressly stated by Appian, and implied by Polybius. The joint government, however, did not last long; <b>for</b> <b>we</b> find Ariarathes shortly afterwards named as sole king.|$|E

25|$|<b>For</b> <b>we</b> {{all agree}} that the most {{excellent}} man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law {{is a kind of}} intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), {{it is clear that the}} intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.|$|E
25|$|While some whites {{responded with}} {{violence}} or exploitation of Mexicans, another recurring effort was Americanization. Since many Mexicans were now {{a part of}} the United States, it was expected that they would act like Americans. The national language in the U.S. is English, so it was thought that the Mexican Americans should be speaking English like the rest of Americans. In 1907, United States’ President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, “We have room for but one language in this country, and that is the English language, <b>for</b> <b>we</b> intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house”. It was clear that a lot of Americans were hostile towards Spanish speaking Mexicans. The English Only movement is a political movement for establishing English as the only official language in the U.S., and using only English in official government operations. Learning a new language as an adult is a very difficult thing to do, so this effect of imperialism was challenging for a lot of new Americans.|$|E
25|$|Horthy's {{personal}} views on Jews {{and their role}} in Hungarian society {{are the subject of}} some debate. In an October 1940 letter to Prime Minister Pál Teleki, Horthy echoed a widespread national sentiment: that Jews enjoyed too much success in commerce, the professions, and industry – success that needed to be curtailed:As regards the Jewish problem, I have been an anti-Semite throughout my life. I have never had contact with Jews. I have considered it intolerable that here in Hungary everything, every factory, bank, large fortune, business, theatre, press, commerce, etc. should be in Jewish hands, and that the Jew should be the image reflected of Hungary, especially abroad. Since, however, {{one of the most important}} tasks of the government is to raise the standard of living, i.e., we have to acquire wealth, it is impossible, in a year or two, to replace the Jews, who have everything in their hands, and to replace them with incompetent, unworthy, mostly big-mouthed elements, <b>for</b> <b>we</b> should become bankrupt. This requires a generation at least.|$|E

25|$|But {{there is}} a {{peculiarity}} in Cousin's doctrine of activity or freedom, and in his doctrine of reason, which enters deeply into his system. This is the element of spontaneity in volition and in reason. This {{is the heart of}} what is new alike in his doctrine of knowledge and being. Liberty or freedom is a generic term which means a cause or being endowed with self-activity. This is to itself and its own development its own ultimate cause. Free-will is so, although it is preceded by deliberation and determination, i.e. reflection, <b>for</b> <b>we</b> are always conscious that even after determination we are free to will or not to will. But {{there is a}} primary kind of volition which has not reflection for its condition, which is yet free and spontaneous. We must have willed thus spontaneously first, otherwise we could not know, before our reflective volition, that we could will and act. Spontaneous volition is free as reflective, but it is the prior act of the two. This view of liberty of will is the only one in accordance with the facts of humanity; it excludes reflective volition, and explains the enthusiasm of the poet and the artist in the act of creation; it explains also the ordinary actions of mankind, which are done as a rule spontaneously and not after reflective deliberation.|$|E
25|$|Channel 3 {{signed on}} October 6, 1953 as WSVA-TV (<b>for</b> <b>We</b> Serve Virginia Agriculture). It {{was owned by}} Frederick L. Allman and his Shenandoah Valley Broadcasting Corporation along with WSVA radio (AM 550 and FM 100.7, now WQPO). The station was a primary NBC affiliate, with {{secondary}} CBS and ABC affiliations. The station also carried DuMont programs. It was the only commercial station between Richmond and Roanoke until WVIR-TV signed on from Charlottesville in 1973. Although it was owned by one of Virginia's leading broadcasters, WSVA-TV operated on a shoestring budget. Station engineers switched {{to and from the}} signals of the three network affiliates in Washington, D.C. because it was unable to afford direct network feeds. The station did not air any locally produced programs (except for local newscasts) until 1956, when it built a studio along U.S. Route 33 in unincorporated Rockingham County. That year, Allman sold the WSVA stations to Transcontinent Television of Buffalo, New York, with NBC executive Hamilton Shea as a minority partner. Allman earned a handsome return on his original investment of 21 years earlier. In 1959, the Washington Evening Star, owner of WMAL AM-FM-TV in Washington, acquired Transcontinent's controlling interest, as well as 1% of Shea's stake. The CBS affiliation was dropped in 1963.|$|E
25|$|Climate {{change was}} {{referred}} to in several of Giddens’s books from the mid-1990s onwards, but was not discussed at length until {{the publication of his}} work The Politics of Climate Change in 2009. Climate change, Giddens says, constitutes a fundamental threat to the future of industrial civilisation as it spreads across the globe. Given that is the case, he asks, why are countries around the world doing so little to counter its advance? Many reasons are involved, but the prime one is the historical novelty of humanly induced climate change itself. No previous civilisation intervened into nature on a level remotely similar to that which we do on an everyday level today. We have no previous experience of dealing with such an issue and especially one of such global scope, or of the dangers it poses. Those dangers hence appear as abstract, and located at some indefinite point in the future. ‘Giddens’s paradox’ consists of the following theorem. We are likely put off responding adequately to climate change until major catastrophes unequivocally connected to it occur; but by then by definition it will be too late. <b>For</b> <b>we</b> have no way of reversing the build-up of greenhouses gases that is driving the transformation of the world’s climate. Some such gases will be in the atmosphere for centuries.|$|E
