5|$|Hispanic {{women were}} <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> {{working outside the}} home prior to World War II, even more than other American women. During World War II, the broad changes {{in the role of}} women caused by a need for labor on the home front {{affected}} the role of Hispanic women, who worked as secretaries and nurses, helped build airplanes, made ammunition in factories, and worked in shipyards.|$|E
5|$|Leech married Mitch Tuohy {{and had two}} sons, Adam and Troy, {{whom she}} <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> {{entering}} competitive swimming, fearing the pressure and strain of racing. In retirement, she shunned competitive sport, but maintained her fitness and athleticism. She taught swimming to disabled children, some of whom represented Australia at the Special Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The {{passenger}} carriages {{used on the}} London Necropolis Railway were not owned by the LNC, but loaned from the LSWR. A set of carriages was permanently loaned, rather than carriages being lent as needed, as the LSWR was concerned that passengers might be <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> using regular LSWR services if they knew that their carriages had potentially carried dead bodies recently.|$|E

5|$|The term is controversial, and its precise {{meaning is}} hard to define. Some {{minority}} students are <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> achieving in school by the negative prejudices of ethnic peers; such a view has been expressed in articles in The New York Times, Time magazine, and The Wall Street Journal—and by public figures and academics across the political spectrum.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, Māori were <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> {{speaking}} {{their own}} language (te reo Māori) in schools and workplaces and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas. It has recently undergone a process of revitalisation, being declared one of New Zealand's official languages in 1987, and is spoken by 3.7% of the population. There are now Māori language immersion schools and two television channels that broadcast predominantly in Māori. Many places have both their Māori and English names officially recognised.|$|E
5|$|Although the Coris were <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> working {{together}} at Roswell, {{they continued to}} do so, specializing in investigating carbohydrate metabolism. They were particularly interested in how glucose is metabolized {{in the human body}} and the hormones that regulate this process. They published fifty papers while at Roswell, with first author status going to the one who had done most of the research for a given paper. Gerty Cori published eleven articles as the sole author. In 1929, they proposed the theoretical cycle that later won them the Nobel Prize, the Cori cycle.|$|E

5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, gay {{relationships}} were <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> being shown in comics which were seen mainly as directed towards children. Until 1989, the Comics Code Authority (CCA), which imposed de facto censorship on comics sold through news stands in the United States, forbade any suggestion of homosexuality. Artists had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character's orientation. Overt gay and lesbian themes were first found in underground and alternative titles which did not carry the CCA's seal of approval.|$|E
5|$|Born in Tokyo, Japan, on July 5, 1968, Ito became {{interested}} in music {{at the age of}} four. He began to learn to play the piano, becoming interested in it after hearing piano music coming from a classroom he passed by daily with his mother. He was also interested in Electone music, but was <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> learning it by a piano teacher. By the time he began composing at the age of ten, he had learned to play alto saxophone, clarinet, and piano, and was interested in becoming a singer/songwriter. When he was close to graduating from college, he decided to pursue a career in composing music; when he asked a professor for advice, the professor recommended becoming a video game music composer, given the recent success in Japan of Dragon Quest III. During March 1990, after applying to several video game companies including HAL Laboratory, Ito began working at Square.|$|E
5|$|Estes' {{organization}} {{attracted a}} $3,000 donation from Anita Bryant, and her pastor traveled to Seattle to give advice on Estes' campaign. However, where Estes {{planned to use}} the network of conservative churches in the city, many members were <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> working with {{him because he was}} a Mormon. The tone of the advertising for the campaign was more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides in major cities and half the cases of syphilis. Perhaps the most significant factor of the campaign was Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk. Two months before election day, Falk shot and killed a suspect {{who turned out to be}} a black, mentally retarded, young boy. The black community was furious with Falk, and transferred their anger to Initiative Thirteen.|$|E

5|$|Ghosh, who co-wrote {{the story}} and the screenplay, began to plan the film while {{awaiting}} the release of his previous film Aladin (2009), but the dismal response to Aladin was a setback. He had to approach several producers to finance him for Kahaani, but was refused and <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> making the film owing to three factors: a pregnant woman as the lead star, a bunch of unknown Bengali actors as the supporting cast and Kolkata as a backdrop. Yashraj Films were willing to produce the film, but wanted Ghosh to sign a three-film deal, which he declined {{because he did not}} want that much commitment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, Peter, Joe and Quagmire are shown {{watching}} television at the Drunken Clam, when an infomercial featuring Rat Pack members Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Dean Martin is shown, featuring several songs with racially offensive lyrics. Immediately after, the group believes that they see their old friend, Cleveland, who moved to Virginia, across the bar, but are disappointed when it is revealed to be a lamp. Peter {{then goes on to}} express his desire to finally replace Cleveland, stating that their group is just like the Muppets character Statler without Waldorf. Deciding to hold auditions for a replacement for their entourage, they first audition actor Kevin Connolly, who is <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> joining once Quagmire attempts to steal his Lucky Charms cereal.|$|E
5|$|Often {{armed with}} no more than shovels and spades, {{soldiers}} and civilians dug for bodies in the rubble. Other than this, rescue workers were faced with a number of obstacles, including the temperatures of the villages damaged. They were warm during the day, although the villages grew colder at night, making rescue work harder and threatening the health of the homeless and anyone alive and trapped under the debris. Many civilians were <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> helping due to fear of aftershocks. According to Gary Oshea of International Rescue, the volunteers did not have enough technical equipment, and the religious leaders seemed unwilling to contribute much. Official rescue work ended on June 24, 2002, when rescue workers said there were no more survivors.|$|E

5|$|Prior to World War II, {{traditional}} Hispanic {{cultural values}} expected {{women to be}} homemakers, thus they rarely left the home to earn an income. As such, women were <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> joining the military. Only {{a small number of}} Hispanic women joined the military before World War II. However, with the outbreak of World War II, cultural prohibitions began to change. With the creation of the Marine Corps Women's Reserve, women such as Corporal Maria (Torres) Maes could attend to certain administrative duties left open by the men who were reassigned to combat zones. After completing boot camp at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, she was sent to Quartermaster School and assigned to the Marine Corps Base at Quantico, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's {{reputation}} at {{this time}} was as a master of orchestration, based on Sadko and Antar. He had written these works mainly by intuition. His knowledge of musical theory was elemental; he had never written any counterpoint, could not harmonize a simple chorale, nor knew the names or intervals of musical chords. He had never conducted an orchestra, and had been <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> doing so by the navy, which did not approve of his appearing on the podium in uniform. Aware of his technical shortcomings, Rimsky-Korsakov consulted Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, with whom {{he and the others}} in The Five had been in occasional contact. Tchaikovsky, unlike The Five, had received academic training in composition at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, and was serving as Professor of Music Theory at the Moscow Conservatory. Tchaikovsky advised him to study.|$|E
5|$|The {{communist}} {{movement was}} also {{strengthened by the}} release of those of its leaders who had been imprisoned by Ubico. Among them were Miguel Mármol, Víctor Manuel Gutiérrez, and Graciela García, the latter unusual for being {{a woman in a}} movement that women were <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> participating in. The communists began to organize in the capital, and established a school for workers, known as the Escuela Claridad, or the Clarity School, which taught reading, writing, and also helped organize unions. Six months after the school was established, President Arévalo closed the school down, and deported all the leaders of the movement who were not Guatemalan. However, the communist movement survived, mostly by its dominance of the teacher's union.|$|E

5|$|In July 1969, the {{prominent}} Luo politician Mboya was assassinated by a Kikuyu, with suspicions being voiced that Kenyatta's government had been responsible. The killing sparked riots in Nairobi, and ethnic tensions were stoked across Kenya. In October 1969, Kenyatta visited Kisumu, located in Luo territory, {{in order to}} open a hospital financed with Soviet aid. He was greeted by a crowd shouting KPU slogans and he lost his temper. When members of the crowd started throwing stones, Kenyatta's bodyguards opened fire on them, killing and wounding several. In response {{to the rise of}} KPU, Kenyatta had introduced oathing, a system in which individuals came to Gatundu to swear their loyalty to him. Journalists were <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> reporting on the oathing system, and several were deported when they tried to do so. Many were pressured or forced to conduct the oaths, generating a condemnation from the country's Christian establishment. In response to the growing condemnation, the oathing was terminated in September 1969, and Kenyatta invited leaders from other ethnic groups to a meeting in Gatundi.|$|E
5|$|In {{additional}} to {{the technical}} limitations, Robinett had struggled with Atari's management over the game. Around {{the time of}} Adventures development, Atari, now owned by Warner Communications, had hired Ray Kassar as general manager of their Consumer Division, and he was later promoted to president and CEO of Atari in December 1978. Kassar interacted with the programmers rarely and generally treated their contributions with indifference. Robinett was initially <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> working on Adventure by his supervisor, George Simcock, who said the ambitious game could not be done based on knowing how much memory Colossal Cave Adventure used. When Robinett developed a working prototype within a month, the management at Atari were impressed, encouraging him to continue the game despite his supervisor's initial response. The management later tried to convince Robinett {{to make it a}} tie-in work for the upcoming Superman movie, which was owned by Warner Communication. Robinett remained committed to his initial idea. Instead, Atari had developer John Dunn offered to take Robinett's prototype source code to make the 1979 Superman game.|$|E
5|$|In late 1172, Aswan was {{besieged by}} former Fatimid {{soldiers}} from Nubia {{and the governor}} of the city, Kanz al-Dawla—a former Fatimid loyalist—requested reinforcements from Saladin who complied. The reinforcements had come after the Nubians had already departed Aswan, but Ayyubid forces led by Turan-Shah advanced and conquered northern Nubia after capturing the town of Ibrim. Turan-Shah and his Kurdish soldiers temporarily lodged there. From Ibrim, they raided the surrounding region, halting their operations after being presented with an armistice proposal from the Dongola-based Nubian king. Although Turan-Shah's initial response was hawkish, he later sent an envoy to Dongola, who upon returning, described the poverty of the city and of Nubia in general to Turan-Shah. Consequently, the Ayyubids, like their Fatimid predecessors, were <b>discouraged</b> <b>from</b> further southward expansion into Nubia due to the poverty of the region, but required Nubia to guarantee the protection of Aswan and Upper Egypt. The Ayyubid garrison in Ibrim withdrew to Egypt in 1175.|$|E
