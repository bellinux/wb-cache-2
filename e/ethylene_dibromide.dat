However, crops in all these countries are affected by fruit flies which reduce crop yields and quality. In addition importing countries impose restrictions on fruit from affected countries. There is very little trade between the islands themselves. The current ban on fumigation using <b>dibromide</b> <b>ethylene</b> imposed by several importing countries has led to several of the nearby markets being closed to products from many of the Pacific Islands. The FAO and the Australian Development Aid Bureau, UNDP and the South Pacific Commission have set up programmes to collect and publicize information on fruit flies, their hosts and their economic importance. Under these programmes countries can lay down scientifically based quarantine agreements. One of the most promising new methods of treatment involves what is known as high temperature forced-air treatment. It can be combined with biological control and other integrated control methods. A system based on putting out protein bait has enabled losses of guava to be reduced from 40 % to under 5 %, mango from 25 % to under 5 % and peppers from 92 % to under 4 %. This method reduces the amount of insecticide residue in fruit and only requires the use of simple spraying equipment, which is very suitable for agricultural subsistence economies.

In addition, we used dexamethasone, a well known inhibitor of TNF-alpha production, to determine whether its administration could suppress hepatocyte proliferation induced by lead nitrate and <b>ethylene</b> <b>dibromide.</b> A single intragastric administration of <b>ethylene</b> <b>dibromide</b> (100 mg/kg) to male Wistar rats enhanced liver TNF-alpha mRNA after 4 and 7 hours, which then returned to control levels by 24 hours.

Pretreatment of rats with a single dose of dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) 60 minutes before lead nitrate (100 mumol/kg) or <b>ethylene</b> <b>dibromide</b> completely abolished the increased levels of liver TNF-alpha mRNA induced by these agents. Inhibition by dexamethasone of TNF-alpha mRNA was associated with an inhibition of liver cell proliferation induced by these mitogens, as measured by [3 H]thymidine incorporation into hepatic DNA, mitotic index, and DNA content.

40|$|Plants {{may serve}} as {{effective}} pump-and-treat systems for mobile contaminants including volatiles such as carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) and <b>ethylene</b> <b>dibromide</b> (EDB). There is considerable interest in finding economical remediation processes for residuals of these compounds from grain fumigations. Experimental investigations with other volatiles have shown that trichloroethylene (TCE) and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) move freely through plants and are released to the atmosphere at very low atmospheric concentrations, even while a significant fraction of the input contaminant {{is removed from the}} contaminated soil. Such compounds are photo-reactive and readily degrade in the atmosphere. Metabolic processes within the plants and associated microorganisms also convert a portion of the input compounds to less volatile materials. Removal of tightly sorbed EDB and CCl 4 from micropores within the soil may be the rate-limiting step for their remediation.

In contrast, detailed concentration histories need to be retained throughout analyses involving two-event models with intermediate-stage clonal growth advantage (clonal two-stage) and multistage models. Cumulative incidence ratios, based on the exact to time-averaged treatment of concentration time dependencies, are evaluated for substances whose toxic responses exhibit moderate (arsenic) and strong (<b>ethylene</b> <b>dibromide)</b> dependence on time of actual exposure.

Finally, the effects of time-variant exposure on risk estimation due to migration and birth-death in an epidemiological setting are examined.
