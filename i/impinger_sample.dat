40|$|Environmental {{assessment}} {{data collected}} in two prior occupational hygiene studies of swine barns and sawmills allowed {{the comparison of}} concurrent, triplicate, side-by-side endotoxin measurements using air sampling filters and bioaerosol impingers. Endotoxin concentrations in impinger solutions and filter eluates were assayed using the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. In sawmills, <b>impinger</b> <b>sampling</b> yielded significantly higher endotoxin concentration measurements and lower variances than filter sampling with IOM inhalable dust samplers. Analysis of variance for repeated measures showed that this association remained after controlling for other factors such as replicate, sawmill, sawmill operation, wood type, and interaction terms. Endotoxin concentrations in the swine barns were 10 -fold higher on average than in sawmills. These samples demonstrated comparable endotoxin concentration estimates for impinger and filter methods although the variability was lower using the impinger method. In both occupational settings, side-by-side replicates were more uniform for the <b>impinger</b> <b>samples</b> than for the filter samples. This study demonstrates that <b>impinger</b> <b>sampling</b> is an acceptable method for quantitation of area endotoxin concentrations. Further, when sampling is performed with impingers for airborne microorganism quantitation, these same impinger solutions can yield valid endotoxin exposure estimates, negating {{the need for additional}} filter sampling...|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{investigators}} {{who are interested}} in the various facets of airborne transmission of disease in research laboratories and hospitals need a simple, continuous, high-volume sampling device that will recover a high percentage of viable microorganisms from the atmosphere. Such a device must sample a large quantity of air. It should effect direct transfer of the air into an all-purpose liquid medium in order to collect bacteria, viruses, rickettsia, and fungi, and it should be easy to use. A simple multi-slit <b>impinger</b> <b>sampler</b> that fulfills these requirements has been developed. It operates at an air-sampling rate of 500 liters/min, has a high collection efficiency, functions at a low pressure drop, and, in contrast to some earlier instruments, does not depend upon electrostatic precipitation at high voltages.

40|$|Cavity 'ringdown' {{spectroscopy}} is besides ion mobility spectroscopy another {{technique for}} the online detection of volatile compounds in air.

30|$|The major {{advantage}} of collecting airborne isocyanates by impingers {{is the large}} sampling capacity (Henneken et al. 2007). The method utilizes a large excess of the derivatisation agent, generating favourable kinetics for the derivatisation reaction and virtually quantitative recovery (Henneken et al. 2007). However, airborne particles could be pass through the impinger in air bubbles, and escape from the trapping solution. In particular, the impinger method does not efficiently wash all the particles between 0.01 and 1.5  μm. For the collection of airborne particles, in-line chemically treated filters coupled in series after the impinger, as an impinger-filter system, are usually used (Karlsson et al. 2000; BSI Standards Publication 2013; Health and Safety Executive HSE 2014; Creely et al. 2006). The advantages of sampling airborne isocyanates by impinger is the simple set-up {{as well as the}} large sampling capacity and efficiency. However, the <b>impinger</b> <b>sampling</b> is impractical for personal air sampling, i.e. when investigating the exposure of workers by attaching a sampling device on their person. Additionally, during prolonged <b>sampling</b> with an <b>impinger,</b> the solvent containing the derivatisation agent could evaporate.|$|R

Air samples were collected at 200 m upwind, and onsite and 300 m downwind by using liquid <b>impinger</b> <b>sampler,</b> calibrated to draw 12. 5 L/min, for 20 minutes. The concentrations ranged between 0. 0 – 7 360 CFU/m 3 for mesophilic, and 106 – 586 CFU/m 3 for thermophilic actinomycetes. Airborne actinomycete concentrations exceeded the suggested occupational exposure limit value of 100 CFU/m 3. No significant correlations were found between actinomycete concentrations onsite and 300 m downwind distance. At the biosolid landfill, upwind thermophilic actinomycetes significantly differed (p< 0. 05) from onsite and 300 m downwind. A total of 40 and 69 airborne actinomycete isolates belonging to 8 genera were identified at the wastewater treatment plant and biosolid landfill. Streptomyces were the dominant actinomycete species. Streptomyces diastaticus, Pseudonocardia compacta and Catellatospora ferruginea were only detected at the biosolid landfill site. Meso–and–thermophilic actinomycetes positively associated with relative humidity, and wind speed positively correlated with onsite thermophilic actinomycetes (r= 0. 65) at the biosolid landfill. Temperature showed negative effect on survivability of mesophilic actinomycetes (r=- 0. 8) onsite of the wastewater treatment plant.

40|$|Background: Airborne {{transmission}} of pathogenic resistant bacteria is well {{recognized as an}} important route for the acquisition {{of a wide range}} of nosocomial infections in hospitals. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of airborne vancomycin and gentamicin (VM and GM) resistant bacteria in different wards of four educational hospitals. Materials and Methods: A total of 64 air samples were collected from operating theater (OT), Intensive Care Unit (ICU), surgery ward, and internal medicine ward of four educational hospitals in Isfahan, Iran. Airborne culturable bacteria were collected using all glass <b>impingers.</b> <b>Samples</b> were analyzed for the detection of VM- and GM-resistant bacteria. Results: The average level of bacteria ranged from 99 to 1079 CFU/m 3. The highest level of airborne bacteria was observed in hospital 4 (628 CFU/m 3) and the highest average concentration of GM- and VM-resistant airborne bacteria were found in hospital 3 (22 CFU/m 3). The mean concentration of airborne bacteria was the lowest in OT wards and GM- and VM-resistant airborne bacteria were not detected in this ward of hospitals. The highest prevalence of antibiotic-resistant airborne bacteria was observed in ICU ward. There was a statistically significant difference for the prevalence of VM-resistant bacteria between hospital wards (P = 0. 012). Conclusion: Our finding showed that the relatively high prevalence of VM- and GM-resistant airborne bacteria in ICUs could be a great concern from the point of view of patients' health. These results confirm the necessity of application of effective control measures which significantly decrease the exposure of high-risk patients to potentially airborne nosocomial infections...|$|R

40|$|The use of nontherapeutic {{levels of}} {{antibiotics}} in swine production can select for antibiotic resistance in commensal and pathogenic bacteria in swine. As a result, retail pork products, {{as well as}} surface and groundwaters contaminated with swine waste, {{have been shown to}} be sources of human exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, it is unclear whether the air within swine operations also serves as a source of exposure to antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. To investigate this issue, we sampled the air within a concentrated swine feeding operation with an all-glass <b>impinger.</b> <b>Samples</b> were analyzed using a method for the isolation of Enterococcus. A total of 137 presumptive Enterococcus isolates were identified to species level using standard biochemical tests and analyzed for resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, virginiamycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin using the agar dilution method. Thirty-four percent of the isolates were confirmed as Enterococcus, 32 % were identified as coagulase-negative staphylococci, and 33 % were identified as viridans group streptococci. Regardless of bacterial species, 98 % of the isolates expressed high-level resistance to at least two antibiotics commonly used in swine production. None of the isolates were resistant to vancomycin, an antibiotic that has never been approved for use in livestock in the United States. In conclusion, high-level multidrug-resistant Enterococcus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and viridans group streptococci were detected in the air of a concentrated swine feeding operation. These findings suggest that the inhalation of air from these facilities may serve as an exposure pathway for the transfer of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens from swine to humans.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to optimize sampling parameters for increased recovery and detection of airborne porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza virus (SIV). Collection media containing antifoams, activated carbons, protectants, and ethylene glycol were evaluated for direct effects on factors impacting the detection of PRRSV and SIV, including virus infectivity, viability of continuous cell lines used for the isolation of these viruses, and performance of reverse transcriptase PCR assays. The results showed that specific compounds influenced the likelihood of detecting PRRSV and SIV in collection medium. A subsequent study evaluated the effects of collection medium, <b>impinger</b> model, and <b>sampling</b> time on the recovery of aerosolized PRRSV using a method for making direct comparisons of up to six treatments simultaneously. The results demonstrated that various components in air-sampling systems, including collection medium, <b>impinger</b> model, and <b>sampling</b> time, independently influenced the recovery and detection of PRRSV and/or SIV. Interestingly, it was demonstrated that a 20 % solution of ethylene glycol collected the greatest quantity of aerosolized PRRSV, which suggests the possibility of sampling at temperatures below freezing.

Therefore, accurate determination of surfactants is crucial in order to investigate the possible effects of surfactants on {{the atmosphere}}. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the optimum sampling method for measuring the maximum quantity of surfactants present in ambient air. Air samples were collected using a range of air sampling pumps that were made to vary in terms of flow rate, storage period, type of absorbing solution and the characteristics of the <b>impinger</b> tube. <b>Samples</b> obtained were analysed by colourimetry for anionic and cationic surfactants as methylene blue-active substances (MBAS) and disulphine blue-active substances (DBAS), respectively.

We found that the optimum sampling method consisted of an absorbent solution (deionised water, buffer solution and methylene blue/disulphine blue solution) with the flow rate of 1. 0 L/min. The concentration of surfactants in all sampling methods remained constant regardless of the storage period (1 day and 4 days), indicating that surfactants in the absorbing solution are quite stable.

40|$|Many {{sources of}} {{airborne}} contaminants {{have always been}} present in various work environments. With the development of thermosetting plastic systems, the use of reactive chemical compounds was greatly increased and thus also the risk of exposure to reactive and potentially hazardous compounds. Exposure can occur in many situations, {{not only at the}} workplace where the raw materials are handled. The finished products may emit unreacted or excess compounds, like in furniture made of particleboard with phenol-formaldehyde resin that may emit formaldehyde for a long time. Another emission source can arise when some thermosetting plastics like polyurethane and phenol-formaldehyde-urea resins are heated, intentionally or by accident. Many different types of isocyanates in a complex mixture are released at such occasions. In an effort to characterise those emissions in more detail, a new analytical method for the derivatisation and analysis of isocyanates was developed. The new derivatisation reagent, di-n-butylamine, was found to be suitable for the determination of many types of isocyanates even when complicated mixtures of air pollutants were present in the work environment. However, {{it was found that the}} used standard <b>sampler,</b> the midget <b>impinger,</b> had almost negligible collection efficiency for particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 1. 5 µm. In the work operations where polyurethane products were heated and decomposed, leading to the emission of isocyanate-containing aerosols, the particles were found to be mainly in the sub-micron range and thus not collected by the <b>impinger</b> <b>sampler.</b> In car repair shops, very high concentrations of airborne isocyanates found to be emitted at common work operations as welding and cutting in polyurethane painted vehicles. As an initial solution, a glass-fibre filter was connected in series after the impinger to collect the particles that otherwise would have escaped sampling. The relatively volatile reagent dibutylamine proved to be well suited for this sampling technique as the reagent evaporates from the sampling liquid and impregnates particles collected on the filter. In air samples taken with this method in car repair shops, very high concentrations of isocyanates were found to be emitted during operations such as welding and cutting in vehicles. In order to avoid undesirable reactions that can take place between the studied compound and other compounds present in the work environment, it is desirable to supply the reagent at the earliest possible moment in the sampling process. The ideal might be to supply the reagent to the sample even before collection. Using the aerosol particles as condensation nuclei for a condensing reagent vapour, this can be done. A new method to supply a large excess of liquid reagent to particles in an aerosol before collection of the particles was presented. This new type of sampler may become useful in the investigation of the actual chemical composition of reactive air contaminants at workplaces...|$|R

This study aimed to determine occupational exposure adverse effects due to fungal contamination produced by A. flavus complex in two Portuguese WWTP using conventional and molecular methodologies. Air samples from two WWTP were collected at 1 m height through impaction method. Surface samples were collected by swabbing surfaces of the same indoor sites. After counting A. flavus and identification, detection of aflatoxin production was ensured through inoculation of seven inoculates in coconut-milk agar.

To apply molecular methods, air samples were also collected using the <b>impinger</b> method. <b>Samples</b> were collected and collection liquid was subsequently used for DNA extraction. Molecular identification of A. flavus was achieved by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the Rotor-Gene 6000 qPCR detection system (Corbett). Among the Aspergillus genus, the species that were more abundant in air samples from both WWTP were Aspergillus versicolor (38 %), Aspergillus candidus (29. 1 %), and Aspergillus sydowii (12. 7 %).

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} Phase 1 of the ''Air Force Hydrazine Detector Characterization and Calibration Project''. A method for calibrating model MDA 7100 hydrazine detectors in the United States Air Force (AF) inventory has been developed. The calibration system consists of a Kintek 491 reference gas generation system, a humidifier/mixer system which combines the dry reference hydrazine gas with humidified diluent or carrier gas to generate the required humidified reference for calibrations, and a gas sampling interface. The Kintek reference gas generation system itself is periodically calibrated using an ORNL-constructed coulometric titration system to verify the hydrazine concentration of the sample atmosphere in the interface module. The Kintek reference gas is then used to calibrate the hydrazine monitors. Thus, coulometric titration is only used to periodically assess {{the performance of the}} Kintek reference gas generation system, and is not required for hydrazine monitor calibrations. One advantage of using coulometric titration for verifying the concentration of the reference gas {{is that it is a}} primary standard (if used for simple solutions), thereby guaranteeing, in principle, that measurements will be traceable to SI units (i. e., to the mole). The effect of humidity of the reference gas was characterized by using the results of concentrations determined by coulometric titration to develop a humidity correction graph for the Kintek 491 reference gas generation system. Using this calibration method, calibration uncertainty has been reduced by 50 % compared to the current method used to calibrate hydrazine monitors in the Air Force inventory and calibration time has also been reduced by more than 20 %. Significant findings from studies documented in this report are the following: (1) The Kintek 491 reference gas generation system (generator, humidifier and interface module) can be used to calibrate hydrazine detectors. (2) The Kintek system output concentration is less than the calculated output of the generator alone but can be calibrated as a system by using coulometric titration of gas <b>samples</b> collected with <b>impingers.</b> (3) The calibrated Kintek system output concentration is reproducible even after having been disassembled and moved and reassembled. (4) The uncertainty of the reference gas concentration generated by the Kintek system is less than half the uncertainty of the Zellweger Analytics' (ZA) reference gas concentration and can be easily lowered to one third or less of the ZA method by using lower-uncertainty flow rate or total flow measuring instruments. (5) The largest sources of uncertainty in the current ORNL calibration system are the permeation rate of the permeation tubes and the flow rate of the <b>impinger</b> <b>sampling</b> pump used to collect gas samples for calibrating the Kintek system. Upgrading the measurement equipment, as stated in (4), can reduce both of these. (6) The coulometric titration technique can be used to periodically assess the performance of the Kintek system and determine a suitable recalibration interval. (7) The Kintek system has been used to calibrate two MDA 7100 s and an Interscan 4187 in less than one workday. The system can be upgraded (e. g., by automating it) to provide more calibrations per day. (8) The humidity of both the reference gas and the environment of the Chemcassette affect the MDA 7100 hydrazine detector's readings. However, ORNL believes that the environmental effect is less significant than the effect of the reference gas humidity. (9) The ORNL calibration method based on the Kintek 491 M-B gas standard can correct for the effect of the humidity of the reference gas to produce the same calibration as that of ZA's. Zellweger Analytics calibrations are typically performed at 45 %- 55 % relative humidity. (10) Tests using the Interscan 4187 showed that the instrument was not accurate in its lower (0 - 100 ppb) range. Subsequent discussions with Kennedy Space Center (KSC) personnel also indicated that the Interscan units were not reproducible when new sensors were used. KSC had discovered that the Interscan units read incorrectly on the low range because of the presence of carbon dioxide. ORNL did not test the carbon dioxide effect, but it was found that the units did not read zero when a test gas containing no hydrazine was sampled. According to the KSC personnel that ORNL had these discussions with, NASA is phasing out the use of these Interscan detectors...|$|R

Solid sorbent sampling methods, using Amberlite XAD- 2 or Tenax, are used for sampling of OAA vapour. These methods are easy to use, have simple work-up procedures and sample the anhydrides as such. However, many OAAs are reactive compounds and losses during storage should be considered. Sampling of OAAs in mixed exposure of particles and vapour are performed by either bubblers or <b>impingers</b> with aqueous <b>sampling</b> solutions or by filters in series with solid sorbent tubes.

In a 5 minute sampling period under controlled conditions, the analytical sensitivity of the AGI- 30, AGI- 4, SKC BioSamplerRTM, and Micro-Tek samplers for PRRSV was calculated at 1 x 101. 1, 1 x 101. 3, 1 x 101. 1, and 1 x 101. 2 TCID 50 equivalents and 1 x 10 1. 4, 1 x 101. 1, 1 x 101. 6, for SIV. Despite marked differences in sampler design, no statistically significant difference in analytical sensitivity was detected between samplers for collection of artificially produced aerosols containing cell culture propagated PRRSV or SIV. Detection thresholds obtained from this experiment were used for reference in excretion studies.;The objective of the third study was to characterize the excretion of these pathogens in respirations from acutely infected pigs. Pigs were inoculated under experimental conditions with one pathogen. Samples were collected from the upper respiratory tract and respiratory exhalations. All pathogens were detected in the upper respiratory tracts of inoculated pigs, but only M. hyopneumoniae and B. bronchiseptica were detected in expired air from individually-sampled, acutely-infected pigs. These findings suggested either that acutely infected pigs did not aerosolize PRRSV, PCV- 2, SIV, or PRCV, or that the quantity of virus excreted was below the analytical sensitivity (detection threshold) of current sampling and/or assay systems at the individual pig level.;The objective of the forth study was to describe the stability of airborne infectious PRRSV as a function of temperature and relative humidity. A cloud of infectious PRRSV was aerosolized using a 24 -jet Collison nebulizer into a dynamic aerosol toroid (DAT) maintained at a specific temperature and relative humidity. The PRRSV cloud within the DAT was sampled repeatedly over time using SKC BioSamplerRTM impingers and the total viral RNA (RT-PCR) and concentration of infectious PRRSV (TCID 50) in the air samples was determined. As measured by quantitative RT-PCR, PRRSV RNA was stable under the conditions evaluated in this study. Thus, a comparison of viral RNA and Rhodamine B dye, a physical tracer, found {{no significant difference in the}} slopes of the lines. Titers of infectious virus were plotted by time and the half-life (T 1 / 2) of infectious PRRSV was calculated using linear regression analysis. An analysis of the results showed that aerosolized PRRSV was more stable at lower temperatures and/or lower relative humidity, but temperature had a greater effect on the T 1 / 2 of PRRSV than relative humidity. Based on these results, an equation was derived to predict the T 1 / 2 of infectious airborne PRRSV for any combination of environmental temperature and relative humidity.;The objective of the fifth study was to describe and validate a method that provides improved estimates of the probability that exposure to a specific dose of an airborne infectious pathogen will result in infection in animals. To validate the proposed method, 7 replicates of 10 pigs per replicate were conducted. Pigs were exposed to specific doses of airborne PRRSV. Following exposure, animals are individually housed and monitored for evidence of infection. The relationship describing the probability of infection after exposure was modeled on the proportions of pigs that became infected by exposure to specific doses. A dose response curve was derived using logistical models. Based on this methodology dose-response curves may be derived for a number of animal host and infectious pathogens.

40|$|The {{growing concern}} about {{indoor air quality}} results from the {{knowledge}} that exposure to indoor air pollutants may be higher than the exposure to outdoor air pollutants and from the evidence that in most developed countries day care centers are places where children {{spend most of their}} time. How environmental factors affect children respiratory health is still controversial and unclear. This paper describes the results from field measurements of physical parameters, chemical and biological indoor contaminants, to investigate indoor environmental quality, in 70 classrooms of 10 Children Day Care Centers (CDCC), located in Lisbon. Objective The aim {{of this study is to}} gather information on indoor environment of CDCC in order to correlate it with both ventilation and children’s health. Material and Methods Chemical contaminants (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, total volatile organic compounds and PM 10), biological contaminants (bacteria, fungi and house-dust mites) and thermal comfort parameters were monitored. Formaldehyde was analyzed according to NIOSH 3500 method using a visible absorption spectrometry with air <b>samples</b> taken on <b>impingers</b> by active <b>sampling.</b> Total volatile organic compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography according to the ISO 16000, part 6, with air samples taken on Tenax TA sorbent by active sampling. Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide measurements were made using a Photoacoustic Multi- Gas Monitor INNOVA. Samples of viable microorganisms were collected using a MAS- 100 sampler with Malt Extract Agar plates, Trypticase Soy Agar and MacConkey agar as collecting media for fungi, total bacteria and gram-negative bacteria. Dust samples were collected on filters using a vacuum cleaner with a DustreamTM collector and determined using an ELISA test to quantify mite antigens. PM 10 were collected using PTFE filters on Personal Environmental Monitors attached to personal pumps and the filters were analyzed gravimetrically for particle mass. Thermal comfort was evaluated according to the ISO 7730 International Standard using a 1213 Bruel & Kjaer analyzer. Results The reported preliminary results only represent a small part of a larger study under development in 20 CDCC located on Lisbon and Porto. The mean CO 2 concentration indoors exceeded the recommended level of 1800 mg/m 3 in 54 % of the 70 studied rooms, with a maximum concentration of 5630 mg/m 3 and an outdoor average of 839 mg/m 3. The majority of the studied rooms had suspended particulate matter, TVOC’s and formaldehyde concentrations under the recommended limits. In 51 % of the rooms the bacterial concentrations exceed 500 ufc/m 3 (recommended limit), being also observed predominance gram-positive bacteria. In 50 % of the studied rooms fungal concentrations were above 500 ufc/m 3, however the mean outdoor concentration was 560 ufc/m 3. Conclusion The preliminary results provide evidence that ventilation is insufficient, resulting in the accumulation of human source contaminants, such as bacteria and CO 2. Taking into consideration that the results correspond to the Spring period, when occupants maintain windows and doors open, we expect worse results in the Winter period...|$|R
