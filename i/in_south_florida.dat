5|$|As {{a center}} for trade and travel between the U.S., the Caribbean, and South America, South Florida is {{especially}} vulnerable to invasive species, or species {{of plants and animals}} that adapt aggressively to conditions in the Everglades, allowing them to reproduce faster and grow larger than they would naturally in their native environments. Approximately 26% of all species of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> are exotic—more than in any other part of the U.S.—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world. Controlling invasive species in 1,700,000 acres (6,900km2) of infested land <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> costs authorities about $500 million a year.|$|E
5|$|As {{metropolitan}} areas <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> began to grow, the Miccosukee {{branch of the}} Seminoles became {{closely associated with the}} Everglades, simultaneously seeking privacy and serving as a tourist attraction, wrestling alligators, selling crafts, and giving eco-tours of their land. As of 2008, there were six Seminole and Miccosukee reservations throughout Florida; they feature casino gaming that supports the tribe.|$|E

5|$|Inhaling helium can be {{dangerous}} if done to excess, since helium is a simple asphyxiant and so displaces oxygen needed for normal respiration. Fatalities have been recorded, including a youth who suffocated in Vancouver in 2003 and two adults who suffocated <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> in 2006. In 1998, an Australian girl (her age is not known) from Victoria fell unconscious and temporarily turned blue after inhaling the entire contents of a party balloon.|$|E
5|$|More than 50 {{species of}} exotic mammals have been {{recorded}} <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Florida,</b> at least 19 of which are self-sustaining. Colonies of feral mammals are established in or around the Everglades, including dogs, pigs, and cats. Wild animals native {{to other parts of}} the U.S. have also been established including nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus Linnaeus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and jaguarundi (Herpailurus yaguarondi).|$|E
5|$|Overall, Hurricane Katrina killed 14people in the state, {{of which}} 6 were {{directly}} related to the storm. Six of the indirect deaths were <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Florida,</b> of which three were from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by generators, one was due to a vehicle accident, one occurred during debris cleanup, and one was associated with a lack of electricity. At least five people were injured due to carbon monoxide poisoning. Overall damage totaled $623million (2005USD).|$|E

5|$|As {{the fields}} of ecology and {{environmental}} studies develop, exotic species attract more attention and their effects become more apparent. Mid-20th century biology texts about invading species reflected more complacency than alarm, as contemporary wisdom about them assumed the host environment would be largely immune. Everglades biologist Thomas Lodge writes that in the 1960s, evidence of non-native plant and animal life <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> was present but not particularly worthy of notice. Over the past decades, however, the number of exotic species and their spread has increased dramatically.|$|E
5|$|August 24, 1992 - Hurricane Andrew makes {{landfall}} on Homestead, {{just south}} of Miami, as a Category Five hurricane with winds of 165mph (265km/h). The winds destroy 25,524homes and damage 101,241 others in southern Florida, leaving up to one-quarter million people temporarily homeless. In Homestead, more than 99% of all mobile homes are completely destroyed. Hurricane Andrew causes $25.5billion in damage (1992USD, $39.2billion 2008USD) <b>in</b> <b>south</b> <b>Florida</b> and 15 direct deaths. At the time, Andrew is the costliest North Atlantic hurricane {{in the history of}} the United States, though has since dropped to fifth after Hurricanes Katrina, Ike, Sandy, and Harvey.|$|E
5|$|Between 06:00 and 12:00 UTC on September10, the United States Weather Bureau issued storm signals, {{equivalent}} to a tropical storm warning in , from Cedar Key, Florida, to Charleston, South Carolina. These were later upgraded to hurricane warnings <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Florida.</b> Due to inclement weather conditions in West Palm Beach, which had been newly incorporated as a town just days earlier, businesses suspended their normal operations and people boarded up buildings, even as the strongest winds arrived. As the cyclone moved into the Gulf of Mexico, reports from September 12 through September 14 helped ships prepare for the storm.|$|E

Bin al-Shibh applied several times for a visa to the United States, but as a Yemeni, he was rejected out of concerns he would overstay his visa and remain as an illegal immigrant. Bin al-Shibh stayed in Hamburg, providing coordination between Atta and Mohammed. The three Hamburg cell members all took pilot training <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Florida.</b>|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} for {{thousands}} of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 to drain the wetlands and develop the land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed, water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable explosive growth of the South Florida metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal building projects were initiated across South Florida. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Florida.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rolle {{left the}} LSU program on May 23. LSU coach John Brady claimed {{this was due}} to {{concerns}} over Rolle's development. Darrel Sears, his former high school coach, said Rolle had been unhappy with LSU since December 2006, and that Brady had been making snide comments about Rolle for a while. After Rolle left LSU, he was courted by Division I schools Wyoming, Marshall, Oral Roberts, Delaware, Louisiana Tech, and South Florida. Although initially interested <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> due to its proximity to his Bahamas home, Rolle chose to transfer to Louisiana Tech to play under Kerry Rupp.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Mediterranean fruit flies in 1929 {{also contributed to the}} nearly {{complete}} destruction of tourism and citrus <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> – two vital economic industries in the region. The federal and state government would spend approximately $7million (1929USD) in eradication efforts. There were foreign and domestic bans on the importation of fruits and vegetables from Florida. Programs established by the New Deal and efforts by Florida governors in mid and late 1930s, particularly David Sholtz, brought relief to the economic slump, but the region remained in an abysmal financial state until the onslaught of American involvement in World War II.|$|E
5|$|The {{calculations}} of Jerry Alisandros {{and the other}} mass tort lawyers are based on their previous experience. Several times before they had caught Varrick marketing seriously faulty drugs, as well as ruthlessly trying out their products in Third World countries. In all these cases, Varrick preferred to negotiate lucrative compensations for these lawyers' clients, of which the lawyers got a big cut. Alisandros expects the same to happen again: the lawsuits {{from all over the}} U.S. would be concentrated <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Florida,</b> with a federal judge which Alisandros considers amendable; Varrick would negotiate, reach again a settlement out of court and everybody will grow rich.|$|E

5|$|The name King was {{not used}} again after the season, {{although}} {{it was on the}} naming list for 1951 and 1952 due to being part of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. The Phonetic Alphabet was decommissioned in 1953 in favor of using female names. Based on population growth <b>in</b> <b>south</b> <b>Florida,</b> it is estimated that a storm identical to Hurricane King would cause $2.8billion in insured damage if it struck in 2001, with the total roughly split between Broward and Miami-Dade counties.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Florida International University's {{founding}} began in 1943, when state Senator Ernest 'Cap' Graham (father of future Florida governor and U.S. senator Bob Graham) presented {{the state legislature}} with the initial proposal {{for the establishment of}} a public university <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Florida.</b> While his bill did not pass, Graham persisted in presenting his proposal to colleagues, advising them of Miami's need for a state university. He felt the establishment of a public university was necessary to serve the city's growing population.|$|E
5|$|Tides {{along the}} Gulf Coast of Florida caused erosion and coastal {{flooding}} in Bay, Collier, Franklin, Gulf, and Wakulla counties. Though winds caused little damage, around 113,000customers were left without electricity <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Florida</b> alone. Further north in Central Florida and the Panhandle, Isaac spawned five tornadoes, one each in Hillsborough, Holmes, Indian River, Jackson, and Osceola counties. All of them ranked as only F0 on the Fujita scale. The worst twister occurred in Indian River County, damaging 133buildings, {{most of which}} were mobile homes. Throughout the state, two indirect fatalities were reported and losses reached approximately $91.54million.|$|E
