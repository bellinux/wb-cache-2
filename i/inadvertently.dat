5|$|Before each flight, a {{briefing}} was held, alerting the crewmembers to basic world events {{as well as}} safety criteria. At least 15 hours before takeoff, the crew would thoroughly pre-flight their aircraft. <b>Inadvertently,</b> this also increased efficiency in terms of maintenance and other pre-flight routines.|$|E
5|$|CENIPA {{concluded}} that the ExcelAire pilots {{also contributed to the}} accident with, among others, their failure to recognize that their transponder was <b>inadvertently</b> switched off, thereby disabling the collision avoidance system on both aircraft, as well as their overall insufficient training and preparation.|$|E
5|$|Customers {{have complained}} that they have created {{subscriptions}} <b>inadvertently</b> and found them difficult to cancel. The most common complaints about Guthy-Renker, according to Truth in Advertising, are unauthorized billing, difficulty cancelling orders, billing for products that never arrive, unhelpful customer service, and refusing refunds despite money-back guarantees.|$|E
5|$|Far {{from being}} extinct, {{in recent years}} the Carménère grape has been {{discovered}} to be thriving in several areas outside France. In Chile, growers almost <b>inadvertently</b> preserved the grape variety during the last 150 years, due largely to its similarity to Merlot.|$|E
5|$|In-person identification: One or {{two women}} from the compound, {{including}} one of bin Laden's wives, identified bin Laden's body. A wife of bin Laden called him by name during the raid, <b>inadvertently</b> assisting in his identification by U.S. armed forces on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Mr J.F. Kennedy (Duncan Preston) {{replaced}} Mr Nixon as {{the head}} in the second series. Like Nixon, Mr Kennedy takes a back-seat in the developments. In the final episode he reads {{a letter from the}} former head, which <b>inadvertently</b> serves to show how their characters are identical.|$|E
5|$|On 20 March 1961, a side-long {{collision}} {{and partial}} derailment resulted in injury to 12 people aboard an arriving service whose driver <b>inadvertently</b> passed a red signal {{and ran into}} an empty train as it left Cannon Street.|$|E
5|$|The RDP {{tables were}} {{developed}} for no-stop diving, but recommend a safety stop at 15fsw for 3 minutes. Emergency decompression for dives which <b>inadvertently</b> exceed the no-stop limit is specified.|$|E
5|$|After a {{video call}} with Lydia, Alice <b>inadvertently</b> opens the video with the suicide instructions. With some difficulty, {{she finds the}} pills {{and is about to}} swallow them, but when she is {{interrupted}} by the arrival of her caregiver she drops the pills on the floor and forgets what she was doing.|$|E
5|$|During a video {{interview}} at Gamescom, {{most of the}} setlist was <b>inadvertently</b> leaked because someone was scrolling through the setlist in the background. Harmonix released a video response to the leak the next day, officially denying the rumored setlist, while once again showing the setlist {{in the background and}} confirming additional songs. The full setlist was formally announced on August 25 on the Rock Band website.|$|E
5|$|During the 1910 gunnery {{training}} exercises, Patrie suffered mechanical {{problems with}} her sighting equipment that disabled {{one of her}} main battery turrets. In 1910 the battleship again was in an accident; while on maneuvers in the Gulf of Jouan, Patrie launched a torpedo that <b>inadvertently</b> struck her sister République. Her hull was damaged, and {{she was forced to}} put into Toulon for repairs.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s {{very few}} {{specialized}} digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers {{from within the}} operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either <b>inadvertently</b> or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.|$|E
5|$|Frozen is a 2013 American 3D computer-animated film {{produced}} by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures.

5|$|German {{reaction}} to the second airborne landings involved mortar barrages and small arms fire, but casualties were negligible. Generalmajor Feuchtinger of 21st Panzer Division watched the gliders descending and, believing the arriving force would threaten his lines of communication, ordered those elements of the division that had reached the beaches to withdraw {{to the north of}} Caen. The gliders' arrival had <b>inadvertently</b> stopped the only German armoured attack on D-Day.|$|E
5|$|If an {{extraterrestrial}} civilization bearing malice towards humanity gained sufficient {{knowledge of}} terrestrial biology and {{weaknesses in the}} immune systems of terrestrial biota, it {{might be able to}} create extremely potent biological weapons. Even a civilization without malicious intent could <b>inadvertently</b> cause harm to humanity by not taking account of all the risks of their actions.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{thousands}} of people were <b>inadvertently</b> exposed to lead containing soil / ore from informal gold mining with the northern state of Zamfara. While estimates vary, it is though that upwards of 400 children died of acute lead poisoning making this perhaps the largest lead poisoning fatality epidemic ever encountered. As of 2016, efforts to manage the exposure are ongoing.|$|E
5|$|In many {{bivalves}} {{that have}} siphons, {{they can be}} retracted back into {{the safety of the}} shell. If the siphons <b>inadvertently</b> get attacked by a predator, they snap off. The animal can regenerate them later, a process that starts when the cells close to the damaged site become activated and remodel the tissue back to its pre-existing form and size.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, suave yet {{rude and}} belligerent spy Sterling Archer, {{prompted}} by questions regarding his expense account, breaks into the mainframe computer of his organization ISIS and <b>inadvertently</b> discovers a mole in the organization.

5|$|John Hancock (Will Smith) is an {{alcoholic}} amnesiac with superhuman powers reminiscent {{to those of}} superheroes. Though he uses his powers to stop criminals in his current residence of Los Angeles, his activity <b>inadvertently</b> causes {{millions of dollars in}} property damage due to his constant intoxication. As a result, he is routinely jeered at crime scenes. Hancock also ignores court subpoenas to address the damage he has caused.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other land}} animals that {{have adapted to}} life in a marine environment, sea snakes ingest {{considerably}} more salt than their terrestrial relatives through their diets, and when seawater is <b>inadvertently</b> swallowed. This meant they had to evolve a more effective means of regulating the salt concentration of their blood. In sea snakes, the posterior sublingual glands, located under and around the tongue sheath, evolved {{to allow them to}} expel salt with their tongue action.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns asks Homer to {{help him}} with a speech for a crisis {{shareholders}} meeting. Homer gives Smithers his last joint, and while Smithers is smoking it, Burns apparently drowns in his bathtub. For the meeting, Smithers and Homer make Mr. Burns into a marionette, and the movement of the marionette <b>inadvertently</b> gets Mr. Burns' heart working again. The meeting is a success, and another financial crisis at the power plant is avoided.|$|E
5|$|One complication—unintentional and unrecognized {{intubation}} of the esophagus—is both common (as frequent as 25% in {{the hands}} of inexperienced personnel) and likely to result in a deleterious or even fatal outcome. In such cases, oxygen is <b>inadvertently</b> administered to the stomach, from where it cannot be taken up by the circulatory system, instead of the lungs. If this situation is not immediately identified and corrected, death will ensue from cerebral and cardiac anoxia.|$|E
5|$|S.thiersii may be {{gathered}} <b>inadvertently</b> and {{thought to be}} edible {{due to the fact}} that it grows on lawns among grasses. This is in contrast to Amanita species which grow around trees and are thus usually seen in forests. It can be distinguished from other white fungi growing in grassland by its fluffy cap, though the white veil fragments may eventually get washed away by rain.|$|E
5|$|Sabra Hillard (Kim Flowers) is the Betty {{assistant}} {{pilot and}} Elgyn's romantic partner. After his death, the situation overwhelms {{her and she}} breaks down. When the survivors must swim, Hillard's hesitation <b>inadvertently</b> puts her within reach of the Aliens; they catch her, and swim off with her flailing body.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the Starfleet crew of the Federation {{starship}} Enterprise-D.

5|$|She {{also claims}} Jake holds {{the secret to}} the aliens' {{whereabouts}} and argues that they must defeat the aliens before the invaders exterminate all life on earth. After taking medicine offered by the Apaches' medicine man, Jake recalls that Alice was euthanized after she was used in an alien experiment, but he had escaped, <b>inadvertently</b> stealing the gauntlet-like alien weapon encasing his wrist. He then also remembers {{the location of the}} aliens' base of operations.|$|E
5|$|Since it is {{impossible}} to entirely eliminate pest insects from the human food chain, insects are <b>inadvertently</b> present in many foods, especially grains. Food safety laws in many countries do not prohibit insect parts in food, but rather limit their quantity. According to cultural materialist anthropologist Marvin Harris, the eating of insects is taboo in cultures that have other protein sources such as fish or livestock.|$|E
5|$|The European {{nightjar}} {{feeds on}} a wide variety of flying insects, including moths, beetles, mantises, dragonflies, cockroaches and flies. It will pick glowworms off vegetation. It consumes grit to aid with digesting its prey, but any plant material and non-flying invertebrates consumed are taken <b>inadvertently</b> while hunting other food items. Young chicks have been known to eat their own faeces.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempted}} expedition had {{a significant}} consequence. Wassmuss left Constantinople to organise the tribes in south Persia to act against British interests. While evading British capture in Persia, Wassmuss <b>inadvertently</b> abandoned his codebook. Its recovery by Britain allowed the Allies to decipher German communications, including the Zimmermann Telegram in 1917. Niedermayer led the group following Wassmuss's departure.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{converted}} into a Gothic anti-Hussite fortress under Sigismund of Luxemburg in 1430, became a Renaissance castle in 1562, and was rebuilt in 1649 in the baroque style.

The two victories brought him the First Class Iron Cross, awarded 19 December 1916. His first victory of 1917, over Captain Daly, <b>inadvertently</b> taught Voss the knack of deflection shooting. Voss later visited Daly in hospital twice.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 23 {{species of fish}} reside in park waters and native game fish species found in the lakes and streams include the westslope {{cutthroat}} trout, northern pike, mountain whitefish, kokanee salmon and Arctic grayling. Glacier {{is also home to}} the threatened bull trout, which is illegal to possess and must be returned to the water if caught <b>inadvertently.</b> Introduction in previous decades of lake trout and other non-native fish species has greatly impacted some native fish populations, especially the bull trout and west slope cutthroat trout.|$|E
5|$|After Reggie catches Delsin vandalizing a billboard, their {{subsequent}} argument is interrupted when a military truck carrying three Conduit prisoners crashes on the Akomish reservation. Two of the Conduits escape, but Delsin manages {{to pull the}} third one, Hank, out of the wreckage, and <b>inadvertently</b> absorb his smoke powers.

She encases Hank in concrete and questions Delsin, suspecting him of hiding something. Delsin can choose to either tell Augustine the truth about his powers or reveal nothing. Regardless, Augustine renders him unconscious before moving on to the other tribe members.|$|E
5|$|After Wollstonecraft's death, her widower {{published}} a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which <b>inadvertently</b> destroyed her reputation {{for almost a}} century. However, {{with the emergence of}} the feminist movement {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.|$|E
5|$|After a day {{watching}} mind-numbing videos in class, Lisa becomes {{concerned that}} her {{education is not}} challenging enough. Meanwhile, Bart's class goes {{on a field trip}} to the Springfield Police Department, where Bart finds a room with several megaphones.
