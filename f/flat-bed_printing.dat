5|$|Each {{section of}} the process was overseen {{by one of the}} prisoners, and the day-to-day {{operations}} were run by Oscar Stein, a former office manager and bookkeeper. Two twelve-hour shifts ensured non-stop production, with around 140 prisoners working. The printed sheets, each containing four notes, were dried and cropped using a steel ruler; the edges were roughened to imitate the deckle finish of the British notes. The operation peaked between mid-1943 and mid-1944, with approximately 65,000 notes a month produced from six <b>flat-bed</b> <b>printing</b> presses.|$|E
25|$|The job of {{designing}} and printing the new stamp {{was carried out}} in a great rush; engraving began only on May 4, and stamp printing on May 10 (a Friday), in sheets of 100 (contrary to the usual practice of printing 400 at a time and cutting into 100-stamp panes). Since the stamp was printed in two colors, each sheet had to be placed into the <b>flat-bed</b> <b>printing</b> press twice, an error-prone process that had resulted in invert errors in stamps of 1869 and 1901, and at least three misprinted sheets were found during the production process and destroyed. It is believed that only one misprinted sheet of 100 stamps got through unnoticed, and stamp collectors have spent the ensuing years trying to find them all.|$|E
50|$|The Currans {{published}} {{the first edition}} of The Sault Weekly Star on August 31, 1901 from a small frame building on East Street in the citys downtown using a hand-operated <b>flat-bed</b> <b>printing</b> press that had earlier printed one of Winnipegs first newspapers.|$|E
50|$|The museum offers display items {{showing the}} {{technological}} {{evolution of the}} press media from its beginnings, such as lithography examples and test benches from 1870, <b>flat-bed</b> <b>printing</b> press, Intertype rotary letterpress type casting machine from 1892, German-made offset printing machine and paper guillotine, old typewriters, telex machines and early examples of telephoto machines, further a 19th-century screw press. Diverse printing equipment used by the Anadolu Agency, the country's first official news agency are also on display.|$|E

50|$|These {{were crucial}} {{times in the}} {{development}} of the company. Bernard had developed his <b>flat-bed</b> <b>printing</b> process to produce 5,000 metres of fabric per week, and in 1966 Laura produced her first dress for social rather than work attire. The long length silhouette became the Laura Ashley trademark. It also was to work successfully in the company's favour, as fashion switched from the mini to the maxi skirt at the end of the 1960s - a newspaper suggested that by donning a Laura Ashley number, women could look as beautiful as Katharine Ross in the film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.|$|E
50|$|In 1917 Donald {{served in}} World War I, presumably having lied about his age. Later that year he {{returned}} from the front suffering from shell-shock. While recovering, he began working {{on the design of}} a small <b>flat-bed</b> <b>printing</b> press. He advertised it in The Model Engineer in 1918 and was overwhelmed by the response. The teenage Aspinall is said to have tried to hand the money over to the local constabulary, rather than face the prospect of fulfilling so many orders. He was persuaded {{that this was not a}} wise move by an understanding policeman, and he eventually produced enough machines to fill the orders.|$|E
5000|$|A large <b>flat-bed</b> <b>printing</b> Wharfedale {{press was}} donated by [...] "friends in Scotland" [...] in 1903 {{and was still}} in use after 1960. Students worked in the print works and also as journalists on the Observer, Calabar's first newspaper, which was {{produced}} on the mission press.In 1903 the HWTI added classes in typing, shorthand, bookkeeping, business management and commerce.The school also included a standard all-ages school section giving primary and secondary education, with fees required for secondary school students. In 1921 Calabar was designated by the government as a secondary examination center for the Cambridge Local Examination. That year 8 students passed the examination out of 14 candidates from HWTI, which was considered an excellent result.|$|E

By 1970, sales had reached £300,000 per year, and in one week alone, London's Fulham Road shop sold 4,000 dresses - which resulted in the new factory in Newtown, Montgomeryshire. It was the opening of the Paris shop in 1974 which was the first to feature the distinctive green frontage and stripped wooden interior; and, in the same year, the first USA shop opened in San Francisco. A licensing operation led to the opening of department store concessions in Australia, Canada and Japan from 1971 onwards. By 1975, turnover was £5million per year and the company employed a thousand people worldwide. Laura turned down the offer of an OBE (she was upset Bernard had not been offered one) but a Queen's Award for Export was accepted in 1977.|$|E
