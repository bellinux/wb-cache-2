5|$|The {{ability to}} {{identify}} <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> critical to joint attention.

40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} to {{identify}} the relationship among small-medium sized hospitals nurse's career plateau, self-efficacy, job embeddedness and turnover <b>intention.</b> The study <b>was</b> conducted through a survey on 217 nurses in five small-medium sized hospitals in J city.

The positive correlations between career plateau and turnover <b>intention</b> <b>were</b> found, but the negative correlation between self-efficacy, job embeddedness and turnover <b>intention</b> <b>were</b> found. The significant factors influencing turnover <b>intention</b> <b>were</b> job embeddedness, present clinical career, career plateau and work unit.

At one point during the video, the dancers run up to a wall, which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to Shirley MacLaine's act in the 1969 film Sweet Charity. Toward the end of the video, Beyoncé flashes her own wedding ring on her finger.|$|E
5|$|Roman Catholic priest Servais Pinckaers {{regarded}} Christian ethics as {{closer to}} the virtue ethics of Aristotle than Kant's ethics. He presented virtue ethics as freedom for excellence, which regards freedom as acting in accordance with nature to develop one's virtues. Initially, this requires following rules—but the <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> that the agent develop virtuously, and regard acting morally as a joy. This is in contrast with freedom of indifference, which Pinckaers attributes to William Ockham and likens to Kant. On this view, freedom is set against nature: free actions are those not determined by passions or emotions. There is no development or progress in an agent's virtue, merely the forming of habit. This is closer to Kant's view of ethics, because Kant's conception of autonomy requires that an agent is not merely guided by their emotions, and is set in contrast with Pinckaer's conception of Christian ethics.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} this can be seen in {{identifying}} the intentions of specific behaviors. We as a society also operate in that way because the same outcome or behavior can be considered acceptable had the <b>intentions</b> for it <b>been</b> good versus another time where the <b>intentions</b> <b>were</b> bad and in that case it would be unacceptable. In a situation where a child is trying to help their parent clean and misplaces something accidentally, it is easily forgiven and is considered morally acceptable because his/her <b>intentions</b> <b>were</b> good. However, if the child purposely hid the object so their parent would not find it, it is morally unacceptable because the <b>intentions</b> <b>were</b> bad. Ultimately, it is the same situation and same outcome but the <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> different. At the age of 10-11 years children realize this concept and start justifying their actions and behaviors by weighing their intentions.|$|R

5|$|Subsequent {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} two important skills in joint attention are following eye gaze and identifying intention. The ability to share gaze with another individual {{is an important}} skill in establishing reference. The ability to identify <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> important in a child's ability to learn language and direct the attention of others. Joint attention is important for many aspects of language development including comprehension, production and word learning. Episodes of joint attention provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development {{and the ability to}} take part in normal relationships are also influenced by joint attention abilities. The ability to establish joint attention may be negatively affected by deafness, blindness, and developmental disorders such as autism.|$|E
5|$|Four middle-aged {{friends who}} {{have known each other}} since sixth form, Baxter (John Simm), Quinn (Philip Glenister), Rick (Marc Warren) and Woody (Max Beesley), get {{together}} for a holiday in Majorca at the villa of Alvo (Ben Chaplin), a mutual friend who became wealthy in the property business. Over time Alvo's behaviour becomes increasingly erratic, and he is later killed by a man in a Tony Blair mask for taking a drug boat the group used earlier. The four clean the boat to remove evidence of their presence, when they are mistaken for drug dealers and paid three million euros. Afterwards, the four learn from María (María Botto), a local detective, that they are caught up in a Serbian mafia drug smuggling operation. Using video camera footage of their holiday, Baxter learns the real perpetrators are corrupt police officers, including María and her superior Dominic (Tim Woodward). Alvo is revealed {{to be a part of}} the operation, and was murdered when he no longer wanted to take part in it. María later attempts to kill the four when employing scare tactics to make them part with the cash fails to work, but is shot to death by Quinn. The other three run over Dominic to save Quinn. They leave with the money and accidentally board a ferry to Ibiza (their <b>intention</b> <b>is</b> to go to Barcelona).|$|E

Yet, speakers do not always code their intentions literally, raising the question of which mechanisms enable interlocutors to exchange communicative intents.

Single (non-) words were spoken with six intonations representing different speech acts—as carriers of communicative <b>intentions.</b> This corpus <b>was</b> acoustically analyzed (Experiment 1), and behaviorally evaluated in two experiments (Experiments 2 and 3).

40|$|Objective: Examine {{the roles}} of action and coping {{planning}} on the intention–behaviour relationship for mothers’ decisions for their young children’s dietary behaviours. Design: Prospective design with two waves of data collection, one week apart. Main outcome measures: Mothers (N = 197, Mage = 34. 39, SD = 5. 65) of children aged 2 – 3 years completed a main questionnaire assessing planning constructs and intentions, and a one-week follow-up of the target behaviours – ‘healthy eating’ and ‘discretionary choices’. Results: <b>Intention</b> <b>was</b> the strongest predictor of behaviour for both dietary behaviours. For healthy eating, intention moderated the indirect relationship between intention–behaviour via planning; coping planning was less important when <b>intention</b> <b>was</b> strong. Further, <b>intention</b> <b>was</b> not a direct predictor of behaviour when <b>intention</b> <b>was</b> relatively low. Action planning was not a direct predictor of either behaviour after accounting for intention and coping planning; action planning on behaviour was mediated by coping planning (only for healthy eating). <b>Intention</b> <b>was</b> not a direct predictor of coping planning; intention on coping planning was mediated by action planning. Neither type of planning predicted discretionary choices. Conclusion: Current findings contribute novel information on the mechanisms underpinning the effect of action and coping planning on the intention–behaviour relationship.
