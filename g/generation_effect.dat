Repeated exposure to these stimuli influence {{the reorganization of}} a person's memory, affecting its details, or implanting vivid false accounts of an event. This is usually accounted for by source-monitoring error, where a person can recall specific facts, but cannot correctly identify the source of that knowledge because of apparent loss of the association between the episodic (specific experience, or source) and semantic (concept-based, or gist) accounts of the stored knowledge. An {{example of this is}} cryptomnesia, or inadvertent plagiarism, where one duplicates a work that they have previously encountered believing it to be their original idea. False memories can also be accounted for by the <b>generation</b> <b>effect,</b> which is an observable phenomenon where repeated exposure to a belief, suggestion, or false information is better remembered with each subsequent generation. This can be seen with the misinformation effect, where an eye-witness account of an event can be influenced by a bystander account of the same event, or by suggestion via an authority figure. It is also believed to influence the recovery of repressed shocking or abusive memories in patients under hypnosis, where the recovered memory, although possibly a vivid account, could be entirely false, or have specific details influenced as the result of persistent suggestion by the therapist.|$|E

40|$|Nairne, Pusen, and Widner (1985) {{described}} {{an experiment in}} which they found that, like nonwords, low-frequency words were {{no more likely to}} be recognized if they had been self-generated atstudy than if they had been read. These findings led Naime et al. to conclude that <b>generation</b> <b>effects</b> depend on the extent o which words are associatively inked to other words in semantic memory, not on lexical representation per se. In a series of experiments designed to test the generality of Nairne et al. 's low-frequency finding, we found not only that <b>generation</b> <b>effects</b> occurred for low-frequency words but also that those effects were on the whole indistin-guishable from effects obtained with high-frequency words. These findings indicate that word frequency does not define an essential boundary condition for <b>generation</b> <b>effects</b> and so provides no basis for preferring an associative hypothesis toa lexical one. <b>Generation</b> <b>effects</b> may be defined, somewhat loosely, as superior memory performance with respect to test items that at study were self-generated rather than read.

50|$|The {{procedural}} account, which builds {{upon the}} lexical activation hypothesis, argues {{that people are}} more likely to engage in particular cognitive procedures during the encoding of items when generating than when reading. The process of generation induces people to connect the item to information in memory (unlike the lexical activation hypothesis, the information in memory does not necessarily reside in the lexicon). The <b>generation</b> <b>effect</b> occurs if the procedures used during encoding are reinstated during the memory test.

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{reports in the}} {{literature}} that suggest that individuals diagnosed with DAT (which stands for dementia of the Alzheimer type) do not show the <b>generation</b> <b>effect.</b> One study included 42 healthy adults, 23 with very mild DAT, and 26 with mild DAT. Researchers Kristi S. Multhaup and David A. Balota had participants read some sentences (e.g., [...] "The horse jumped the fence") and generate the endings to other sentences (e.g., [...] "The gentleman opened the [...] "). Later, participants were given the subjects of the sentences (e.g., [...] "horse"; [...] "gentleman") and asked to recall the object that had been paired with {{the words in the}} previous sentences (e.g., [...] "fence"; [...] "door"). Healthy older adults showed higher recall for words that they had generated compared with 383 words that they had read (i.e., a significant <b>generation</b> <b>effect).</b> In contrast, individuals diagnosed with DAT did not show a difference in recall for words that they had generated and words that they had read. Similarly, another study reported four experiments with the same group of 18 DAT individuals and found little evidence for a <b>generation</b> <b>effect</b> in word recall, word recognition, or recall of action instructions.|$|E

50|$|According to the multifactor transfer-appropriate {{processing}} account, {{the generation}} task forces participants {{to focus their}} processing {{on the type of}} information needed to solve the generation task. When a later test is sensitive to the same type of information, a <b>generation</b> <b>effect</b> occurs. However, when there is not a match between the type of information processed to solve the generation task and the type of information needed to do well on a later test, the <b>generation</b> <b>effect</b> does not occur. For example, a participant that is required to generate same-category targets from distinctive semantic cues (e.g., PURR-C_T, SADDLE-H_RS_) is likely to notice similarities between the targets (e.g., they are all animals). This type of manipulation would promote whole-list relational processing, which may enhance generation performance on a free recall test. Other manipulations can emphasise cue-target processing, thus helping generation performance on cued recall tests.|$|E

Thus, there is a cumulative <b>generation</b> <b>effect</b> such that nutrition and health over generations influences the height of descendants to varying degrees.|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} {{is presented}} {{of the recent}} developments {{in the application of}} large eddy simulation (LES) for prediction and analysis of local entropy generation in turbulent reacting flows. A challenging issue in such LES is subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling of filtered entropy generation terms. An effective closure strategy, recently developed, is based on the filtered density function (FDF) methodology with inclusion of entropy variations. This methodology, titled entropy FDF (En-FDF), is the main focus of this article. The En-FDF has been introduced as the joint velocity-scalar-turbulent frequency-entropy FDF and the marginal scalar-entropy FDF. Both formulations contain the chemical reaction and its entropy <b>generation</b> <b>effects</b> in closed forms. The former constitutes the most comprehensive form of the En-FDF and provides closure for all of the unclosed terms in LES transport equations. The latter is the marginal En-FDF and accounts for entropy <b>generation</b> <b>effects,</b> as well as scalar-entropy statistics. The En-FDF methodologies are described, and some of their recent predictions of entropy statistics and entropy generation in turbulent shear flows are presented...|$|R

50|$|It is {{possible}} that the <b>generation</b> <b>effect</b> may cause a trade-off in encoding item information and associative information. The processing of item-specific features of the target item may be enhanced when generating, and generating may also enhance the processing of cue-target relation. But, encoding requires limited-capacity resources, so the better encoding of one type of information may occur at a cost to the encoding of other information. This also has implications for applying generation to educational practices because even if generation improves the recall of specific words, the memory for the contextual information surrounding those words may suffer.|$|E
50|$|The {{focus of}} the program was on Sperm whales, a {{cosmopolitan}} species found in every major ocean. As long-lived apex predators, Sperm whales represent a useful bioindicator of health in the marine ecosystem in a toxicological context, owing to the effects of three key processes: bioaccumulation, biomagnification and the <b>generation</b> <b>effect.</b> Sadly, these three processes also make Sperm whales, and other apex predators, at great risk from toxic pollution.

50|$|According to the lexical {{activation}} hypothesis, {{the participant}} must search {{his or her}} semantic memory {{during the process of}} generation. The search activates semantic features in memory that are related to the target item. During the retrieval of the target item at testing, the semantic features serve as retrieval cues and aid in the recall of the target item. One study done by Payne, Neely, and Burns further tested this hypothesis. Their research question was: will the <b>generation</b> <b>effect</b> occur for words only or also non-words? To test this they studied 168 Purdue undergraduate students. The researchers divided the participants up into two groups. The first group had word or non word pairs that rhymed and were told to read both out loud. The second group had a word or non word and the first letter of the next followed by blanks, and were told to read the first word out loud and generate a word that rhymed with the first word and started with the letter presented. The results were as expected. Participants were only generating words rather than non words according to the lexical activation hypothesis.|$|E
5000|$|The lost <b>generation</b> <b>effect</b> impacts {{also their}} families. Youth in many {{countries}} now live with their parents into their late twenties. This contributes to {{what is called the}} [...] "full-nest syndrome". In 2008, 46% of 18- to 34-year-olds in the European Union lived with at least one parent; in most countries the stay-at-homes {{were more likely to be}} unemployed than those who had moved out. In families, it is common that when one person becomes unemployed, other members of the family begin looking for or securing employment. [...] This is called the added worker effect. This can sometimes take the form of employment in the informal sector when necessary. Alongside the shift in youth living situations, the impact of returning to live with parents as well as difficulty finding a fulfilling job lead to mental health risks. Being unemployed for a long period of time in youth has been correlated to decreased happiness, job satisfaction and other mental health issues. Unemployed youth also report more isolation from their community. Youth who are neither working nor studying do not have the opportunity to learn and improve their skills. They are progressively marginalised from the labour market and in turn can develop an anti-social behaviour.|$|E
