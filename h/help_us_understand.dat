25|$|To {{choose an}} example that did not get much {{attention}} in the debate (because it was shared by both sides), the Solow-Swan model assumes a continuously-attained equilibrium with 'full employment' of all resources. Contrary to Keynesian economics, saving determines investment in these models (rather than vice versa). The fact that the critique was also stated entirely using exactly {{the same kind of}} unrealistic assumptions meant that {{it was very difficult to}} do anything but 'criticize' Solow and Swan. That is, Sraffian models were explicitly divorced from empirical reality. And, as is very common in debates, it was much easier to destroy neoclassical theory than to develop a full-scale alternative that can <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> the world.|$|E
25|$|New advancements in biotechnological {{experimental}} {{methods such as}} the use of Bessel beam plane illumination microscopy and FRET-based sensor molecules can better demonstrate dynamic structures of gap junction plaques. For these experiments, different types of AB5 toxins can be used to induce the fast formation of tCDR in E.Coli cells. The response can then be recorded using cAMP concentration fluctuations in gap junction-coupled cells using FRET-based sensor constructs. Research suggests that CDRs could perhaps be linked with rapid rearrangement of lipids and protein in connexin channels within the gap junction plaques. This can further <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> the signaling cascade that follows a cellular loss of K+ when exposed to bacterial infection.|$|E

25|$|The {{texts in}} the Version A and Cotton Otho B.xi are {{sufficiently}} similar {{to show that}} ultimately they do derive from one source. The historian David Hill shows how all of the recensions {{can be used to}} correct each other or at least <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> how errors, especially in the hidage numbers, were mistranscribed in the copying process. Hill argues that these errors are not conflicts of facts or derive from differing lists, but simply errors in copying from a common source; it is possible to see that this was because lines of the text were being missed. However, as noted above, the ‘B’ recensions do not list Burpham, Wareham and Bridport, it is likely that their common archetype must have missed them also. Yet it too must have contained the ‘grand total’ sentence at the end which is flatly contradicted by the hidages enumerated.|$|E

2500|$|Mirror neurons are neurons {{that fire}} both when an animal acts {{and when the}} animal observes the same action {{performed}} by another. Thus, the neuron [...] "mirrors" [...] {{the behavior of the}} other, as though the observer were itself acting. Such neurons have been directly observed in primate and other species including birds. The function of the mirror system is a subject of much speculation. Many researchers in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology consider that this system provides the physiological mechanism for the perception action coupling (see the common coding theory). They argue that mirror neurons may be important for understanding the actions of other people, and for learning new skills by imitation. Some researchers also speculate that mirror systems may simulate observed actions, and thus contribute to theory of mind skills, while others relate mirror neurons to language abilities. Neuroscientists such as Marco Iacoboni (UCLA) have argued that mirror neuron systems in the human brain <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> the actions and intentions of other people. In a study published in March 2005 Iacoboni and his colleagues reported that mirror neurons could discern if another person who was picking up a cup of tea planned to drink from it or clear it from the table. In addition, Iacoboni {{and a number of other}} researchers have argued that mirror neurons are the neural basis of the human capacity for emotions such as empathy. Vilayanur S. Ramachandran has speculated that mirror neurons may provide the neurological basis of self-awareness.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of her essay, Clark {{considers}} the question of what makes a piece of literature a classic and why the idea of [...] "the classics" [...] is important to society as a whole. Clark says that [...] "teachers of English have been so long trained in the 'classics' that these 'classics' have become to them very much like the Bible, for the safety of which the rise of modern science causes such unnecessary fears." [...] She {{goes on to say that}} among the sources she consulted was a group of eighth-graders when she asked them the question: [...] "What do you understand by the classics in literature?" [...] Two of the answers Clark received were [...] "Classics are books your fathers give you and you keep them to give to your children" [...] and [...] "Classics are those great pieces of literature considered worthy to be studied in English classes of high school or college". Calvino agrees with the Ohio educator when he states [...] "Schools and universities ought to <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> that no book that talks about a book says more than the book in question, but instead they do their level best to make us think the opposite." [...] Clark and Calvino come to a similar conclusion that when a literary work is analyzed for what makes it 'classic', that in just the act of analysis or as Clark says [...] "the anatomical dissection", the reader can end up destroying the unique pleasure that mere enjoyment a work of literature can hold.|$|E
2500|$|Freudian {{analysis}} {{is a fairly}} recent step in literature devoted to the painting. Several psychoanalytic scenarios dealing with the “primal scene” and the “castration complex” apply amazingly well to Les Demoiselles D’Avignon. They <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> both {{the suppression of the}} “memento mori” allegory and the brutality of the finished picture. According to Sigmund Freud the female body figures in male fantasy are mapped as a castrated body, Les Demoiselles do not simply represent a figure of impotence; rather, woman becomes phallic through her association with this powerful fantasmatic energy. As Steinberg and others see them, Picasso's demoiselles are eminently phallic: the prostitute second from left [...] "arrives like a projectile"; the one in the centre is [...] "a pillar nude"; the crouching figure at the right evokes [...] "a jumping jack"; and all the women [...] "start up like jerked puppets.” To construct the female figure as a phallus is, in Freudian terms, a fetishistic strategy, a gesture at once of recognition and disavowal of the alarming fact that women have no penises. Numerous critics have framed Picasso's act in creating Les Demoiselles in related terms, as a self-ministering ploy to exorcise his private [...] "demons," [...] his fear of women and others. [...] "My first exorcism-painting," [...] the artist once called the picture, in an oft-quoted statement. The demons within the work however, represented are mere fissions of danger. As, the images presented are merely paintings on canvas and rather than putting the viewer at risk of physical harm allow them to address their anxiety within the sanitized gallery space. Freud’s short text Medusa’s head with all its multitude of meanings - Including the notion that Medusa’s head is the female sex organ - the sight of which arouses castration anxiety in the young male; the image of castration itself (decapitation); and the denial of castration, on the one hand by the multiplication of penises (her hair consists of snakes) and, on the other, by its power to turn the spectre to stone, in other words, into an erect, albeit dead, phallus.|$|E

2500|$|Low income black {{communities}} that have been segregated by social forces through city design {{have higher levels of}} criminal activity rates. Different methods when applied <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>understand</b> how social forces and urban design segregated {{black communities}} from white communities. [...] "Shaw and McKay argued that three structural factors- low economic status,ethnic heterogeneity and residential mobility- led to the disruption of community social organization,which,in turn, accounted for variations in crime and delinquency." [...] Radical geography has been searching for connections between [...] "the truths of how capitalism's political economy structures urban space and the emphasis on the subjective evaluation of safe urban space.". The geographical structure of a city is designed to keep high income communities separate from low income, generally black communities are formed with this structure. This type of segregation tends to increase rates of intra- racial victimization, but decrease rates of inter-racial victimization." [...] One method of segregating blacks form whites is through 'gated communities' which isolates the high income population from the low income by gating the higher status community with fences or bars. The result of this 'gated' segregation leads to an unmanageable high criminal activity called a 'ghetto' community where [...] "spatial isolation leads to social isolation, which in turn has a variety of negative outcomes including serious crime." [...] Erecting physical barriers such as gates protects the high income community, leaving the black community to be isolated and an island by itself referenced as a 'ghetto' community. This can be referred to as 'Broken Windows' in which a community,"sends a signal" [...] that it, [...] "does not care about itself" [...] and the community is unable to protect itself from,"criminal invasion." [...] By pushing the low income earners out of the gentrified community, the city is creating a large segregated criminal zone within the city. [...] "This divide has, in turn, produced disparate social worlds, in which the interests, resources, opportunities, and concerns of racial groups located in distinct neighborhoods increasingly diverge, ultimately leading to unequal rates of crime." [...] The ghetto is labeled as an undesirable area to live and the people in that area are labeled the same. [...] "We have also seen that those who commit crimes tend to be from the same groups that {{are most likely to be}} victimized." [...] This causes criminal behavior of the people within the area as [...] "greater racial segregation appears to substantially increase violent crimes such as robberies and aggravated assaults." [...] However it could be argued that the area that an underprivileged person lives in dictates the criminal mentality of the individual. [...] "Poor individuals are simply more prone to committing property crimes than are richer individuals." [...] Having so many people displaced into the ghetto region of a city that commit many different types of criminal actives would be a reason why those communities have higher crime rates.|$|E
