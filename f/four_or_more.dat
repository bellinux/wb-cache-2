5|$|Flock {{behaviour}} in sheep {{is generally}} only exhibited {{in groups of}} <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> sheep; fewer sheep may not react as expected when alone or with few other sheep. Being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of sheep is to flee from danger when their flight zone is entered. Cornered sheep may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture. This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.|$|E

Among the frontline bowlers who played in <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> Tests, Johnson had the worst average by a factor of almost two and took the least number of wickets. Johnson had little impact with the bat, scoring 51 runs at a batting average of 10.20, but took five catches in the slips.|$|E
5|$|Initially, it was rumoured that, {{following}} the armistice, all French {{troops would be}} soon returned by the Germans. From the autumn of 1940, the Germans began to repatriate French reservists whose private occupations were in short supply in Vichy France, such as medical workers like doctors and nurses along with postmen and gendarmes. In 1941, after lobbying by the Vichy government, the policy was extended to French veterans of World War I and fathers of <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> children. Individual prisoners with good contacts could also be requested for repatriation. In practice, this meant that {{a disproportionate number of}} prisoners who were released early came from the upper classes.|$|E

5|$|Opinions were {{generally}} favorable towards FreeSpace 2s multiplayer implementation. SquadWar received favorable {{responses from the}} reviewers who were impressed by its persistent nature and statistics tracking. While the required registration with PXO was considered a troublesome process by a few, the gameplay itself was a smooth experience with no lag at all. Other reviewers' experiences with lag were different. Reynolds of Combatsim.com said Internet gaming was laggy with ships jumping places, but LAN gaming was smooth sailing. GameSpy's reviewer said lag became more apparent on a dial-up connection during a multiplayer mission with <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> players. FiringSquad's reviewer's experience was similar {{but he said the}} lag was not enough to hinder his enjoyment of the multiplayer action.|$|E
5|$|This species mates for life, and pairs {{return to}} the same burrow year after year. The single egg is not {{replaced}} if lost. This is a long-lived species: one bird has returned to its burrow for ten consecutive years, and the lifespan {{is estimated to be}} about 16years. The age of first breeding is unknown, but assumed to be <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> years. Despite the proximity of the breeding sites, Zino's and Fea's petrels have never been found at each other's nesting areas, and Zino's is not known to hybridise with any other species.|$|E
5|$|Wasps in {{the genus}} Sphecius are not habitually {{aggressive}} {{and use their}} venom mainly to paralyse cicadas which they take back to their nests to feed their young. The females catch around <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> cicadas for provisioning, place them in brood cells and lay eggs in the cells. S.grandis is endemic to Central America, Mexico and the Western United States, and is found at a higher mean altitude than other species of Sphecius.

5|$|An Early Classic tomb was {{inserted}} under the main pyramid at Zaculeu; {{it had been}} tunnelled from the volcanic ash underlying the structure. A broad stairway descended to the tomb from the main plaza. The tomb interior was painted red and the floor was scattered with the remains of more than 100 ceramic vessels. These were crushed when {{the roof of the}} tomb collapsed. Also found were the remains of 34 pyrite mirrors of a type similar to those found at Kaminaljuyu. A sizeable quantity of jade was recovered from the tomb, including beads and earplugs. Some of the jade beads had been carved to represent human and parrot faces. The tomb contained the bones of <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> individuals. The ceramic offerings included decorated tripod vessels, polychrome bowls and a polychrome cylindrical vase that had a painted band of hieroglyphs. One ceramic bowl is painted in a negative painting style that is similar to finds from Nebaj.|$|E
5|$|An off spinner, Johnson was {{a member}} of Bradman’s first-choice team, playing in four of the five Tests before being dropped for the final rubber. He also played in the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and Leveson-Gower's XI, where Australia {{selected}} their strongest possible team. However, Johnson was not prominent in the Test success, taking seven wickets at 61.00, his best result being 3/72 in the first innings of the Second Test. Among the five frontline bowlers used in <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> Tests, Lindwall, Miller, Toshack, Johnston and Johnson, the last had the worst average by a factor of almost two; Toshack averaged 33.09 and the others less than 23.50. Lindwall and Johnston took 27 wickets each, while Miller and Toshack took 13 and 11 respectively. Johnson’s economy rate was the second worst of the quintet and his strike rate of 156.86 was more than twice as bad as the others, with the exception of Toshack (94.46). Johnson also had little impact with the bat, scoring 51 runs at 10.20, but he did take five catches in the slips.|$|E

5|$|The Hugo Award for Best Fancast {{is awarded}} to the best non-professional audio or video {{periodical}} devoted to science fiction, fantasy, or related subjects. The fancast must have released <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> episodes {{by the end of}} the previous calendar year, at least one of which appeared in that year, and it must not qualify for the dramatic presentation category. It must also not provide or be published by an entity that provides a quarter or more of the income of any one person working on the fancast. The name of the award is a portmanteau of fan and podcast. The Hugo Award for Best Fancast was first proposed as a category after the 2011 awards, and then appeared as a temporary category at the 2012 awards. Temporary awards are not required to be repeated in following years. The 2013 awards, however, did repeat the category, and afterwards it was ratified as a permanent category, and will appear in all future years.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen is {{composed}} of five somites, all of which lack appendages except the last. The back-facing margins of these somites bear small spines and <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> larger spines. The last abdominal somite forks {{into a pair of}} flattened spatulate appendages (the uropods) that function as a tail fan (caudal rami). In addition to stabilising the body while swimming, a quick flick of the tail fan can rapidly propel the animal backwards, which may have functioned as a means of escaping predators like in modern shrimp. Traces of four fused segments are evident in the three faint lines dividing each lobe of the tail fan. A long telson is present {{at the end of the}} body. Traces of a rounded stomach, small digestive glands, and an intestine that terminates into a tiny anal opening on the telson can also be observed in some specimens.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Mario is {{a falling}} block tile-matching video {{game in which}} Mario assumes {{the role of a}} doctor, tossing two-colored medical {{capsules}} into a medicine bottle representing the playing field. This area is populated by viruses of three colors: red, yellow, and blue, which stay in their starting position until removed. In a manner and style considered similar to Tetris, the player manipulates each capsule as it vertically falls 1 unit of space at a time, able to move it left or right and rotate it 90 degrees in either clockwise or counter-clockwise. When <b>four</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. Any remaining capsule halves or whole capsules which are now not supported by a virus or capsule will fall {{to the bottom of the}} playing field or until it hits another supported object, and any new 4-in-a-row alignments created from this will also be removed. The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from the playing field. A game over occurs if capsules fill up the playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle's narrow neck. After each 5th level is completed on Medium or High difficulty, up to level 20, a cut-scene is shown where the virus trio is sitting on a tree as music plays and an object flies across the screen.|$|E
