5|$|Jones talked openly {{of running}} <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> 2003 {{but did not}} enter the race.

He served as chair of KEEP from 2004 to 2011.|$|E
5|$|Morrow's first {{political}} experience {{was working in}} his uncle William O. Bradley's gubernatorial campaign in 1895. In 1899, Republican gubernatorial candidate William S. Taylor offered to make Morrow his Secretary of State in exchange for Bradley's support in the election; Bradley refused. Despite the encouragement of friends, Morrow declined to run <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> 1911.|$|E

5|$|As a Republican in {{a heavily}} Democratic state, Bradley found little success {{early in his}} {{political}} career. He was defeated for {{a seat in the}} United States House of Representatives and in the United States Senate twice each. After rising to national prominence with his speech seconding the presidential nomination of Ulysses S. Grant at the 1880 Republican National Convention, he was nominated <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> 1887. Although he lost the contest to Simon Bolivar Buckner, he reduced the usual Democratic majority substantially. He was again nominated <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> 1895. Capitalizing on divisions in the Democratic Party over the issue of free silver, he defeated Parker Watkins Hardin in the general election. His term was marked by political struggles and violence. He was an advocate for blacks and did much to advance their status in the state, but was unable to enact much of his reform agenda because of a hostile Democratic majority in the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{supporters}} {{sought to}} make him the National Republican nominee <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> the election of 1828. Though his nomination was all but certain, Crittenden declined the opportunity, fearing that his association with Clay, who was losing popularity in the state, would cost his party the election. Instead, he threw his support behind Thomas Metcalfe, {{who went on to}} carry a very close election over Democrat William T. Barry. Crittenden instead sought another term in the Kentucky House, but was again denied the seat.|$|E

5|$|Following her {{two terms}} as the Secretary of State, Paulus ran <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> 1986.

He was defeated <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> 1910, but was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1914.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when he ran}} <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> 1826, Edwards had {{the good}} fortune to enter a {{three-way}} race that split the Jacksonians between state Senator Thomas Sloo and Lieutenant Governor Adolphus Hubbard. As a campaign issue, Edwards focused on Illinois' dire financial situation, blaming Sloo and Hubbard and other legislators for it. Edwards won 49.5percent of the vote to Sloo's 46percent, with the rest going to Hubbard.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Nunn again {{considered}} {{a bid for}} governor, precluding a potential bid by his son, Steve, a state representative from Glasgow. He cited personal and health issues for not making the race. In 2000, he backed the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain. Nunn reconciled with his son, and when Steve ran <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> 2003, Louie supported him. After Steve Nunn ran third in a four-way primary, the elder Nunn supported the Republican nominee, Ernie Fletcher, hosting a fundraiser for him.|$|E
5|$|In October 2015, The Boston Globe first {{reported}} that Wolf was considering {{not running for}} re-election. Weeks later in November, Wolf confirmed that he would remain in office, but would not seek re-election in 2016. Wolf's political aspirations were prodded shortly after handily winning re-election in 2014, though {{he said he was}} more focused on serving his constituents than considering future office. After rumors that Wolf would not seek re-election in 2016 in order to focus on a run <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> 2018 began circulating, Senate President Stan Rosenberg suggested it was because Wolf wanted to focus more on running his airline company.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{announced}} his intent {{to retire from}} the House in early 1818. In December 1818, the state legislature was to elect a replacement for outgoing senator Isham Talbot.

5|$|Long {{began his}} {{involvement}} in politics {{at the local level}} in Hingham in 1870. Temperance was a major issue which dominated his political beliefs. His early politics was somewhat independent: he supported the reformist Republican Benjamin Butler <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> 1871, but received an unsolicited Democratic nomination later that year for a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He did not campaign, and lost the election. Nominated by both Democrats and reformist Republicans in 1872, he lost again. He thereafter became more of a Republican stalwart, convinced that reform would be best accomplished from within the party organization.|$|E
5|$|Madison's {{political}} experience before becoming governor {{consisted of a}} twenty-year tenure as state auditor. Although his military service made him extremely popular in Kentucky, he sought no higher office until the citizens insisted he run <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> 1816. James Johnson, his only challenger in the race, dropped out early due to Madison's overwhelming popularity, and Madison was elected without opposition. A few weeks later, {{he became the first}} Kentucky governor to die in office. Opponents of his lieutenant governor, Gabriel Slaughter, mounted a popular but unsuccessful challenge to Slaughter's succeeding Madison in office.|$|E
5|$|That year Palmer also {{established}} the Columbia River Road Company {{to build a}} trail through the Columbia River Gorge on the Oregon side of the river. In 1864, Palmer {{was elected to the}} State Senate and served in that chamber through 1866. This included the 1865 special session of the legislature when Oregon adopted the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution that abolished slavery throughout the United States. He ran <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> the 1870 election as the Republican candidate, but was narrowly defeated by La Fayette Grover, largely for his Indian policies.|$|E

5|$|The Whigs {{nominated}} Dixon <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> 1851. The Democrats {{countered with}} Lazarus Powell. Still friends from their earlier days as law partners, the two often traveled together during the campaign.

Clay drew about 6,000 votes, mostly from Whigs, and Powell won the election by a small majority.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{was a critical}} event in both candidates' political careers, with Warren becoming a political icon after entering the Senate, and being drafted to run for President in 2016. After the election loss, Brown was considered the most prominent Republican in Massachusetts and heavily favored {{to run in the}} Senate special election the following year or <b>for</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>in</b> 2014, though he declined to do either. He instead moved to New Hampshire and ran for the Senate there in 2014 against Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen. He lost, 51% to 48%, becoming the first man to lose two Senate races to women.|$|E
5|$|After {{rendering}} noncombat {{service in}} World War II and graduating from law school, Nunn entered local politics, {{becoming the first}} Republican county judge {{in the history of}} Barren County, Kentucky. He worked on the campaigns of Republican candidates for national office, including John Sherman Cooper, Thruston Morton, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was the Republican nominee <b>for</b> <b>governor</b> <b>in</b> 1963, but ultimately lost a close election to Democrat Ned Breathitt. An executive order signed by Governor Bert T. Combs that desegregated Kentucky's public services became a major issue in the campaign. Nunn vowed to repeal the order if elected, while Breathitt promised to continue it.|$|E
