As expected, the measured <b>daytime</b> D <b>region</b> electron density profile heights showed temporal variations quantitatively correlated with solar zenith angle changes. In the midlatitude geographical regions near Duke University, the observed quiet time heights decreased from ∼ 80 km near sunrise to ∼ 71 km near noon when the solar zenith angle was minimum. The measured height quantitative dependence on the solar zenith angle was slightly different from the low-latitude measurement given in a previous work. We also observed unexpected spatial variations not linked to the solar zenith angle on some days, with 15 % of days exhibiting regional differences larger than 0. 5 km. In these 2 months, 14 days had sudden height drops caused by solar flare X-rays, with a minimum height of 63. 4 km observed. The induced height change during a solar flare event was approximately proportional to the logarithm of the X-ray flux. In the long waveband (wavelength, 1 - 8 Å), an increase in flux {{by a factor of}} 10 resulted in 6. 3 km decrease of the height at the flux peak time, nearly a perfect agreement with the previous measurement.

30|$|The {{equatorial}} and low-latitude F region ionosphere presents some perculiar characteristics behavior {{when compared}} to the middle and high latitude ionosphere. For example, in the <b>daytime</b> E <b>region</b> (90 – 120 km), dynamo processes generate eastward electric fields, which are transmitted to F region altitudes (150 – 800 km) by equipotential geomagnetic filed lines, causing both ions and electrons to drift upward, perpendicular to B with an E × B/B 2 drift velocity (Anderson et al., 2002). At the same time, forces parallel to B due to gravity and plasma pressure gradients act to transport plasma along the magnetic field lines. The resultant effect is to create crests in electron density {{on either side of the}} magnetic equator at ± 15 to 18 degrees dip latitudes known as the equatorial ionospheric anomaly (EIA) (e.g., Namba and Maeda, 1939; Appleton, 1946).

Changes in the signal properties are signatures of variations in the conductivity of the reflecting boundary of the lower ionosphere which {{is located in the}} mesosphere and lower thermosphere, and their analysis is, therefore, a way to study processes in these remote regions. Here we present a study on amplitude perturbations of local origin on the VLF transmitter signals (NPM, NLK, NAA, and JJI) observed during tropical cyclone (TC) Evan, 9 – 16 December 2012 when TC was in the proximity of the transmitter-receiver links. We observed a maximum amplitude perturbation of 5. 7 dB on JJI transmitter during 16 December event.

30|$|To {{interpret}} {{these local}} time and seasonal variation of solar activity trends, we discuss various factors influencing the electron density in low- and mid-latitude <b>region.</b> The <b>daytime</b> electron density {{is determined by}} the balance of production due to photoionization, recombination loss, and transport (Rishbeth and Garriot 1969). In addition to the effect of neutral dynamics, the transport due to equatorial fountain effect influences the midday electron density in low-latitude region near the anomaly crest. The equatorial anomaly starts to develop in the morning around 0900 LT but the crest in this period is closer to the equator (Sastri 1990). The anomaly reaches its peak strength during the postnoon period (1300 – 1600 LT) after a time lag of around 2 – 3  h {{from the time of the}} maximum electrojet strength (Rush and Richmond 1973). Therefore, the contribution of the transport process via fountain effect to the enhancement of NmF 2 in the low-latitude region is less significant in the forenoon hours than in the midday hours. The E[*]×[*]B vertical drift which peaks around 1100 LT (Fejer et al. 1979; 2008) in the <b>daytime</b> low-latitude <b>region</b> can affect the density at a particular altitude but the daytime E[*]×[*]B vertical drift is almost the same for low and high solar flux conditions (Scherliess and Fejer 1999; Fejer et al. 2008). The variation of F 2 layer height (hmF 2) may also affect the variation trends of NmF 2 with solar activity through the altitudinal dependency of solar activity effect (Su and Bailey 1999). In the forenoon period, the electron density in low mid-latitude stations like Dibrugarh/Okinawa would be mainly affected by the production-loss mechanism and the neutral dynamics. Therefore, the diurnal, seasonal, altitudinal, and solar activity variations of neutral composition, chemical reactions rates, and dynamics would affect the observed diurnal and seasonal variations of NmF 2 solar activity effect.|$|R

This capability makes it possible to frequently and even continuously monitor the D region electron density profile variations over geographically large regions, which are measurements that are essentially impossible by other means. These guided waves, usually called atmospherics (or sferics for short), are recorded by our sensors located near Duke University. The purpose of this work is to develop and implement algorithms to derive the variations of D region electron density profile which is modeled by two parameters (one is height and another is sharpness), by comparing the recorded sferic spectra to a series of model simulated sferic spectra from using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) code. In order to understand the time scales, magnitudes and sources for the midlatitude nighttime D region variations, we analyzed the sferic data of July and August 2005, and extracted both the height and sharpness of the D region electron density profile. The heights show large temporal variations of several kilometers on some nights and the relatively stable behavior on others. Statistical calculations indicate that the hourly average heights during the two months range between 82. 0 km and 87. 2 km with a mean value of 84. 9 km and a standard deviation of 1. 1 km. We also observed spatial variations of height as large as 2. 0 km over 5 degrees latitudes on some nights, and no spatial variation on others. In addition, the measured height variations exhibited close correlations with local lightning occurrence rate on some nights but no correlation with local lightning or displaced lightning on others. The nighttime profile sharpness during 2. 5 hours in two different nights was calculated, and the results were compared to the equivalent sharpness derived from International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) models. Both the absolute values and variation trends in IRI models are different from those in broadband measurements. Based on sferic data similar to those for nighttime, we also measured the <b>daytime</b> D <b>region</b> electron density profile variations in July and August 2005 near Duke University. As expected, the solar radiation is the dominant but not the only determinant source for the <b>daytime</b> D <b>region</b> profile height temporal variations. The observed quiet time heights showed close correlations with solar zenith angle changes but unexpected spatial variations not linked to the solar zenith angle were also observed on some days, with 15 % of days exhibiting regional differences larger than 0. 5 km. During the solar flare, the induced height change was approximately proportional to the logarithm of the X-ray fluxes. During the rising and decaying phases of the solar flare, the height changes correlated more consistently with the short (wavelength 0. 5 - 4 Å), rather than the long (wavelength 1 - 8 Å) X-ray flux changes. The daytime profile sharpness during morning, noontime and afternoon periods in three different days and for the solar zenith angle range 20 to 75 degrees was calculated. These broadband measured results were compared to narrowband VLF measurements, IRI models and Faraday rotation base IRI models (called FIRI). The estimated sharpness from all these sources was more consistent when the solar zenith angle was small than when it was large. By applying the nighttime and daytime measurement techniques, we also derived the D region variations during sunrise and sunset periods. The measurements showed that both the electron density profile height and sharpness decrease during the sunrise period while increase during the sunset period. Dissertatio...|$|R

Consideration is given to the time history of the ionospheric plasma as it undergoes convective motion due to the combined effects of corotation forces and electromagnetic forces which results from the mapping of the magnetospheric cross tail electric field to the rotating ionosphere. A simple model of the convection pattern is described. The model calculates the net effect of the tendency for the plasma to corotate about the geographic pole and the E sub Bar times B sub Bar velocity induced by a perpendicular electric field mapped to a circle centered about a point 5 deg antisunward of the geomagnetic pole and oriented such that the equipotentials are parallel to the noon midnight meridian.

40|$|Wind {{turbines}} remove {{kinetic energy}} from the atmospheric flow, which reduces wind speeds and limits generation rates of large wind farms. These interactions can be approximated using a vertical kinetic energy (VKE) flux method, which predicts that the maximum power generation potential is 26 % of the instantaneous downward transport of kinetic energy using the preturbine climatology. We compare the energy flux method to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional atmospheric model equipped with a wind turbine parameterization over a 105 km 2 region in the central United States. The WRF simulations yield a maximum generation of 1. 1 We·m− 2, whereas the VKE method predicts the time series while underestimating the maximum generation rate by about 50 %. Because VKE derives the generation limit from the preturbine climatology, potential changes in the vertical kinetic energy flux from the free atmosphere are not considered. Such changes are important at night when WRF estimates are about twice the VKE value because wind turbines interact with the decoupled nocturnal low-level jet in this <b>region.</b> <b>Daytime</b> estimates agree better to 20 % because the wind turbines induce comparatively small changes to the downward kinetic energy flux.

The path used was from U. S. Navy transmitter NPM (21. 4 kHz) on Oahu to Keauhou, 306 km away, on the west coast of the Big Island of Hawaii, where ionospheric sensitivity was high due to the destructive interference between the ionospherically reflected wave and the ground wave, particularly around the middle of the day. The height and sharpness are thus found to vary from H′ = 69. 3 ± 0. 3 km and β = 0. 49 ± 0. 02 km� 1 for SZA 10 °, at midday, to H′ > 80 km and β 0. 30 km� 1 as the SZA approached 70 °– 90 °, near dawn and dusk for this tropical path. Additional values for the variations of H′ and β with solar zenith angle are also found from VLF phase and amplitude observations on other similar paths: the short path, NWC to Karratha (in NW Australia), and the long paths, NWC to Kyoto in Japan and NAU, Puerto Rico, to St. John’s Canada. Significant differences in the SZA variations of H′ and β were found between low and middle latitudes resulting from the latitudinally varying interplay between Lyman α and galactic cosmic rays in forming the lower D region.

However, there has been no detailed study to investigate the effect of asymmetrical warming on root dy-namics at the level of terrestrial ecosystems. To understand the effects of day and night warming on root lifespan in the semiarid temperate steppe in northern China, a field study with a full factorial design including control, day warming, night warming and continuous warming was conducted using modified rhizotron technique during three growing seasons in 2007 – 2009. Our results show that day, night and continu-ous warming had different effects on longevity of roots born in spring, summer and autumn, and that day warming sig-nificantly prolonged overall lifespan for the roots born in the three growing seasons, while night warning had no effect on overall lifespan. Day and night warming had different ef-fects on root non-structural carbohydrate content, suggesting that allocation of photoassimilate may account for the dif-ferential responses of root lifespan to day and night warm-ing. These results differ from other processes associated with ecosystems C cycle such as total ecosystem produc-tivity, net ecosystem productivity and soil respiration. Our findings highlight that it is essential to incorporate the dif-ferential effects of day and night warming on root dynamics into simulating and predicting the responses and feedbacks of terrestrial ecosystems C cycling to global warming. ...|$|R

All six sites in the Sacramento Valley have higher 8 -h maximum average ozone on the weekend {{and are more likely to}} exceed the national standard of 85 ppb on the weekend. In contrast, all the sites in the Mountain Counties are less likely to exceed the federal ozone standard on the weekend. Analysis of the day-of-week trends in odd oxygen show that the weekend effect of ozone within Sacramento is strongly influenced by NO sources close to the monitoring sites. This suggests that ozone measurements from monitoring sites close to highways, including two rural locations, may not be representative of the regional abundance, and lead to underestimates of long term exposure for humans and ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Roots are key {{components}} of C cycling in terrestrial ecosystems and {{play an important role}} in the regulation of response of terrestrial ecosystems to global climate warming, which is predicted to occur with greater warming magnitudes at night than during <b>daytime</b> across different <b>regions</b> on the Earth. However, there has been no detailed study to investigate the effect of asymmetrical warming on root dynamics at the level of terrestrial ecosystems. To understand the effects of day and night warming on root lifespan in the semiarid temperate steppe in northern China, a field study with a full factorial design including control, day warming, night warming and continuous warming was conducted using modified rhizotron technique during three growing seasons in 2007 – 2009. Our results show that day, night and continuous warming had different effects on longevity of roots born in spring, summer and autumn, and that day warming significantly prolonged overall lifespan for the roots born in the three growing seasons, while night warning had no effect on overall lifespan. Day and night warming had different effects on root non-structural carbohydrate content, suggesting that allocation of photoassimilate may account for the differential responses of root lifespan to day and night warming. These results differ from other processes associated with ecosystems C cycle such as total ecosystem productivity, net ecosystem productivity and soil respiration. Our findings highlight that it is essential to incorporate the differential effects of day and night warming on root dynamics into simulating and predicting the responses and feedbacks of terrestrial ecosystems C cycling to global warming...|$|R
40|$|During the wet {{season in}} the southwestern Amazon <b>region,</b> <b>daytime</b> water {{transport}} out of the atmo-spheric mixed layer into the deeper atmosphere is shown to depend upon cloud amounts and types and synoptic-scale velocity fields. Interactions among clouds, convective conditions, and subcloud-layer prop-erties were estimated for two dominant flow regimes observed during the 1999 Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission component of the Brazilian Large-Scale Biosphere–Atmosphere (TRMM-LBA) field campaign. During daytime the cloud and subcloud layers were coupled by radiative, convective, and precipitation processes. The properties of cloud and subcloud layers varied according to the different convective influ-ences of easterly versus westerly lower-tropospheric flows. The most pronounced flow-regime effects on composite cloud cycles occurred under persistent lower-tropospheric flows, which produced strong convec-tive cloud growth with a near absence of low-level stratiform clouds, minimal cumulative attenuation of incoming solar irradiance (25 %), rapid daytime mixed-layer growth (100 m h 1), and boundary layer drying (0. 22 g kg 1 h 1), high convective velocities (1. 5 m s 1), high surface buoyancy flux (200 W m 2), and high latent heat flux (600 W m 2) into cloud layer. In contrast, persistent westerly flows were less convective, showing a strong morning presence of low-level stratiform genera (0. 9 cloud amount), greater cumulative attenuation of incoming solar irradiance (47 %), slower mixed-layer growth (50 m h 1) with a slight tendency for mixed-layer moistening, and a delayed peak in the low-level cumuliform cloud cycle (2000 versus 1700 UTC). The results reported in this article indicate that numerical models need to account for cloud amounts and types when estimating water vapor transport to the cloud layer...|$|R
30|$|In a {{previous}} work (J. Geophys. Res., 110 (A 01308), 1 – 11, 2005), the authors developed an original {{approach to the}} processing of total electron content (TEC) data obtained by GPS signals from the Japan receiver network. This approach includes removing the diurnal and seasonal variation carried by 27 -day medians and the solar rotation periodicity. The relative deviations of TEC from the median—from all measured locations at a given hour—were then approximated by a regression line along the main prolongation of the Japan islands, between latitudes 24 ° and 45 °N. The two variables of the regression line, the average value at {{the center and the}} slope were obtained as a time series, and their behavior during geomagnetic storms in the period 2000 – 2002 were analyzed. One interesting result was the observed enhancement of TEC {{at the end of the}} recovery phase of the storms. The slope variations clearly showed that this enhancement started from the south and was interpreted as a poleward expansion of equatorial crest. In the present paper we further analyze this post-storm phenomenon, adding foF 2 data from Japanese Kokubunji and Okinawa ionosondes. We also show the latitude extension of the poleward expansion by using lat/UT contour plots. The results confirm that most of the post-storm TEC enhancements are part of the equatorial crest region which extends poleward during nighttime. In some cases, the enhanced TEC structures develop by separating from the crest <b>region.</b> <b>Daytime</b> TEC enhancements were also observed. Their structures are not confined to the equatorial crests region, but occupy the whole latitude range considered in this study. TEC post-storm enhancements were generally found to be in agreement with foF 2 variations.|$|R

It achieved its final orbit and began Earth observations on February 24, 2000 for Terra and June 24, 2002 for Aqua. A comprehensive set of remote sensing algorithms for cloud masking and the retrieval of cloud physical and optical properties has been developed {{by members of the}} MODIS atmosphere science team. The archived products from these algorithms have applications in climate change studies, climate modeling, numerical weather prediction, and fundamental atmospheric research. In addition to an extensive cloud mask, products include cloud-top properties (temperature, pressure, effective emissivity), cloud thermodynamic phase, cloud optical and microphysical parameters (optical thickness, effective particle radius, water path), as well as derived statistics. Over the last year, extensive improvements and enhancements in the global cloud products have been implemented, and reprocessing of all MODIS data on Terra has commenced since first light in February 2000. In the cloud mask algorithm, the most extensive improvements were in distinguishing clouds at nighttime, including the challenging polar darkness regions of the world. Additional improvements have been made to properly distinguish sunglint from clouds in the tropical ocean regions, and to improve the identification of clouds from snow during <b>daytime</b> in Polar <b>Regions.</b> We will show global monthly mean cloud fraction for both Terra and Aqua, and show how similar the global daytime cloud fraction is from these morning and afternoon orbits, respectively. We will also show the zonal distribution of cloud fraction over land and ocean regions for both Terra and Aqua, and show the time series of global cloud fraction from July 2002 through June 2006...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve the {{forecasting}} of atmospheric aerosols, the ensemble square root filter algorithm was extended to simultaneously optimize the chemical initial conditions (ICs) and emission input. The forecast model, which was expanded by combining the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model and a forecast model of emission scaling factors, generated both chemical concentration fields and emission scaling factors. The forecast model of emission scaling factors was developed by using the ensemble concentration ratios of the WRF-Chem forecast chemical concentrations and also the time smoothing operator. Hourly surface fine particulate matter (PM 2. [*] 5) observations were assimilated in this system over China from 5  to 16  October  2014. A series of 48  h forecasts was then carried out with the optimized initial conditions and emissions on each day at 00 : 00  UTC and a control experiment was performed without data assimilation. In addition, we also performed an experiment of pure assimilation chemical ICs and the corresponding 48  h forecasts experiment for comparison. The {{results showed that the}} forecasts with the optimized initial conditions and emissions typically outperformed those from the control experiment. In the Yangtze River delta (YRD) and the Pearl River delta (PRD) regions, large reduction of the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) was obtained for almost the entire 48  h forecast range attributed to assimilation. In particular, the relative reduction in RMSE due to assimilation was about 37. 5  % at nighttime when WRF-Chem performed comparatively worse. In the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (JJJ) region, relatively smaller improvements were achieved in the first 24  h forecast but then no improvements were achieved afterwards. Comparing to the forecasts with only the optimized ICs, the forecasts with the joint adjustment were always much better during the night in the PRD and YRD regions. However, they were very similar during <b>daytime</b> in both <b>regions.</b> Also, they performed similarly for almost the entire 48  h forecast range in the JJJ region...|$|R

This study aimed to detect spatiotemporal change patterns of PM 2. 5 from August 2013 to July 2014 in Beijing, and to assess the relationship between PM 2. 5 and meteorological factors. Daily and hourly PM 2. 5 data from the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau (BJEPB) were analyzed separately.

The Kruskal-Wallis H test, Bonferroni correction, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to assess differences in PM 2. 5 levels associated with spatial and temporal factors including season, <b>region,</b> <b>daytime</b> and day of week. Relationships between daily PM 2. 5 and meteorological variables were analyzed using the generalized additive mixed model (GAMM). Annual mean and median of PM 2. 5 concentrations were 88. 07 μg/m 3 and 71. 00 μg/m 3, respectively, from August 2013 to July 2014. PM 2. 5 concentration was significantly higher in winter (P < 0. 0083) and {{in the southern part of}} the city (P < 0. 0167).

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comparison}} of the electron density and temperature behaviour in the ionosphere and plasmasphere measured by the Millstone Hill incoherent-scatter radar and the instruments on board of the EXOS-D satellite with numerical model calculations from a time-dependent mathematical model of the Earth's ionosphere and plasmasphere during the geomagnetically quiet and storm period on 20 – 30 January, 1993. We have evaluated the value of the additional heating rate that should be added to the normal photoelectron heating in the electron energy equation in the <b>daytime</b> plasmasphere <b>region</b> above 5000 km along the magnetic field line to explain the high electron temperature measured by the instruments on board of the EXOS-D satellite within the Millstone Hill magnetic field flux tube in the Northern Hemisphere. The additional heating brings the measured and modelled electron temperatures into agreement in the plasmasphere and into very large disagreement in the ionosphere if the classical electron heat flux along magnetic field line is used in the model. A new approach, based on a new effective electron thermal conductivity coefficient along the magnetic field line, is presented to model the electron temperature in the ionosphere and plasmasphere. This new approach leads to a heat flux which is less than that given by the classical Spitzer-Harm theory. The evaluated additional heating of electrons in the plasmasphere and the decrease of the thermal conductivity in the topside ionosphere and the greater part of the plasmasphere found for the first time here allow the model to accurately reproduce the electron temperatures observed by the instruments on board the EXOS-D satellite in the plasmasphere and the Millstone Hill incoherent-scatter radar in the ionosphere. The effects of the daytime additional plasmaspheric heating of electrons on the electron temperature and density are small at the F-region altitudes if the modified electron heat flux is used. The deviations from the Boltzmann distribution for the first five vibrational levels of N 2 (v) and O 2 (v) were calculated. The present study suggests that these deviations are not significant at the first vibrational levels of N 2 and O 2 and the second level of O 2 , and the calculated distributions of N 2 (v) and O 2 (v) are highly non-Boltzmann at vibrational levels v &gt; 2. The resulting effect of N 2 (v &gt; 0) and O 2 (v &gt; 0) on NmF 2 is the decrease of the calculated daytime NmF 2 up to a factor of 1. 5. The modelled electron temperature is very sensitive to the electron density, and this decrease in electron density results in the increase of the calculated daytime electron temperature up to about 580 K at the F 2 peak altitude giving closer agreement between the measured and modelled electron temperatures. Both the daytime and night-time densities are not reproduced by the model without N 2 (v &gt; 0) and O 2 (v &gt; 0), and inclusion of vibrationally excited N 2 and O 2 brings the model and data into better agreement.
