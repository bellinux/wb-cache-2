5|$|In 1917, {{during the}} First World War, {{he began a}} love affair with Parisian courtesan Marguerite Alibert (later Fahmy), who kept a {{collection}} of his indiscreet letters after <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> the affair in 1918 to begin one with an English married woman, Freda Dudley Ward, a textile heiress.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Beatty regained {{control over his}} ships, after having boarded , the German ships had too great a lead for the British to catch them; at 13:50, <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> the chase. Kaiser Wilhelm II was enraged by the {{destruction}} of Blücher and the near sinking of Seydlitz, and ordered the High Seas Fleet to remain in harbor. Rear Admiral Eckermann was removed from his post and Admiral Ingenohl was forced to resign. He was replaced by Admiral Hugo von Pohl.|$|E
5|$|She became {{engaged to}} the {{physicist}} Hans Bethe in 1934. The two {{had known each}} other since 1925. However, his mother, although herself Jewish, was opposed to her son marrying a Jewish girl, and <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> the engagement {{a few days before the}} wedding was to take place. Bethe's action shocked Franck and Bohr. Although an eminent physicist, Bethe would not be invited to visit the Niels Bohr Institute until after the Second World War. Levi never married, but became friends with many of the physicists who did visit the Institute, including Otto Frisch, George Placzek, Rudolf Peierls, Leon Rosenfeld, Edward Teller and Victor Weisskopf.|$|E
50|$|On July 22, 2006, Gatti lost by a TKO to Carlos Baldomir, {{vying for}} the WBC & The Ring Welterweight Championship. <b>He</b> then <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> his {{relationship}} with Buddy McGirt and had a new trainer in Micky Ward.|$|R
50|$|Once Roger {{turns up}} at Walter's office, {{it turns out}} that he is the result of Walter's {{relationship}} with a black woman, who is now dead. Walter's father-in-law had warned him that the relationship would be harmful to his career, so <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> it <b>off.</b>|$|R
50|$|At ADFA (Australian Defence Force Academy) {{while doing}} a course to further {{her career in}} the RAN, she formed a brief {{relationship}} with (now Commander) Mike Flynn. <b>He</b> <b>broke</b> it <b>off</b> for unknown reasons, and eventually she ended up serving as his executive officer on HMAS Hammersley.|$|R
5|$|Sihanouk came {{to believe}} that {{communist}} triumph in Southeast Asia was inevitable and that Cambodia's military was incapable of defeating the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), even with U.S. support. If Cambodia (and his rule) was to survive, he would have to make a bargain with the devil. On 10 April 1965 <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> diplomatic relations with the U.S. and swung politically to the left. To gain foreign support, both economic and political, Sihanouk turned to the People's Republic of China. One of the terms of the agreement between Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai was that Cambodia would allow the use of its eastern border by the North Vietnamese in their effort to reunify the two Vietnams.|$|E
5|$|On 14 June, Littorio {{participated in}} the {{interception}} of the Operation Vigorous convoy to Malta from Alexandria. Littorio, Vittorio Veneto, four cruisers and twelve destroyers were sent to attack the convoy. The British quickly located the approaching Italian fleet and launched several air strikes early on 15 June with Wellington and Bristol Beaufort bombers {{in an attempt to}} prevent them from reaching the convoy. The aircraft scored no hits on the battleships, but they did disable the cruiser , which was later sunk by a British submarine. Later that morning another air attack, this time B-24 Liberators from the USAAF, occurred. The high-level bombers scored one hit on Littorio and several near misses around her and Vittorio Veneto, but neither ship was seriously damaged. Another British strike with Beauforts arrived shortly thereafter, but Italian and German fighters had since arrived and they shot down two Beauforts and damaged five others. By the afternoon, Iachino had concluded that he would not reach the convoy before dark, and so <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> the operation. On the return voyage, another British air attack succeeded in torpedoing Littoiro.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{approached}} Port Stanley, {{the capital}} of the Falklands, early on the morning of 8 December; the British quickly spotted them, and raised steam to go out and meet them. Von Spee initially thought the smoke clouds to be the British burning their coal stocks to prevent the Germans from seizing them. Upon realizing the presence of the powerful British squadron, <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> the attack and turned to flee. The British quickly steamed out of the harbor in pursuit. By 12:55, the battlecruisers had caught up to the retreating Germans, and opened fire on Leipzig, the last ship in the German line, though she was not hit. Von Spee ordered the light cruisers to detach and flee while Scharnhorst and Gneisenau turned on their pursuers, in the hope that he could cover their escape. In response, Sturdee sent his cruisers to chase down Nürnberg, Dresden, and Leipzig.|$|E
6000|$|A moment's pause. [...] "Wait!" [...] <b>he</b> said, and <b>broke</b> <b>off.</b> <b>He</b> hesitated. [...] "Good-bye," [...] he said {{as though}} he was {{snapping}} a thread that held them together.|$|R
6000|$|Button-Bright nodded again. [...] "I {{ought to}} tell you my story," [...] he said, [...] "and then you'd understand.

50|$|The {{man took}} the {{throwing}} stick {{he was carrying}} and worked it into the sand. <b>He</b> then <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> a hollow reed and, placing it in the hole he had thus developed, lay down on his stomach and appeared to suck up something through the reed. His companion repeated his movements before they quietly moved on...|$|R
5|$|Cabaniss {{was killed}} in an {{accident}} on board the Swatara on January 19, 1882. An official report of the incident was released on March 25 of that year. According to the report, before-noon exercises on board the ship had just been completed when an order was made to prepare rifles for target practice. At around ten in the morning, Cabaniss was assisting in the instruction of the ship's second group of sailors when <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> and entered the ship's engine room to instruct a sailor on his duties. An experienced sailor, Ensign James P. Parker, was explaining to new sailors how to properly load their guns. He showed them how to load and discharge the weapons using a practice round. He then reloaded his gun with live rounds, but apparently forgot this and fired one of them. The bullet ricocheted off the ship's deck, struck one of the guns, ricocheted off the deck again, and struck Cabaniss, killing him instantly. The ball first entered through his left arm, impacting it so strongly that it broke every bone in his elbow. It then entered his side, tearing his latissimus dorsi muscle; went into his chest, severing every major artery; ricocheted up to near his shoulder, exited his right side, and struck the man he was instructing in the shoulder. Cabaniss was reported to have never made a sound as he fell. The other sailor recovered.|$|E
25|$|Having {{claimed a}} share of the {{business}}'s profits from 1897 to 1916, in 1917 <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> his business arrangements with the Joels. After a long legal dispute in South Africa, Woolf settled for £900,000 plus £50,000 in costs. He then sued his family for the £50,000, as well as £23,883 for disbursements.|$|E
25|$|While {{the love}} of her life was {{reportedly}} the writer and theatre critic / director Walter Kerr, <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> their engagement and married someone else. In 1954, Brennan married St. Clair McKelway, The New Yorker's managing editor. McKelway had a history of alcoholism, womanizing and manic depression and had already been divorced three times. Brennan and McKelway divorced after five years.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he met the}} fixed, breathless gaze {{of those}} {{wonderful}} eyes {{from the other side}} of the table, and <b>he,</b> too, <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> in the middle of his sentence. He breathed heavily, as though he had been running. His large, coarse lips drew wider apart. Slowly a mirthless and very unpleasant smile dawned upon his face.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> {{eventually}} <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> {{with the}} party he once founded, due to ideological incompatibility with his once Finance Minister, now Prime Minister, Nikola Gruevski, and founded VMRO-NP. Despite {{the members of the}} party do not consider themselves as Bulgarians, they strongly declare their bulgarophilness and criticize the official statements about the Macedonian history issued by the politicians and historians in the country.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{initially}} {{a friend and}} business associate of Cecil Rhodes, but <b>he</b> publicly <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> ties, blaming Rhodes's discriminatory legislation against the Cape's Black African population and his policies regarding the Boer Republics. Molteno {{went on to become}} one of the most outspoken denouncers of Rhodes and other statesmen perceived at the time as strongly pro-imperialist, such as Chamberlain and Milner.|$|R
25|$|On 13 October when {{he arrived}} at Elchingen, Riesch found Loudon {{sparring}} with a French force for control of the bridge over the Danube. Feeling unable to defeat the French, <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> the fight and merely posted troops to defend the north bank of the river and left the bridge intact with the French in control of {{the south end of the}} span. He passively ordered his troops to pitch camp at Elchingen. Kagan proposed that Riesch failed to act more aggressively because he had lost faith in Mack's ability.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Nova Scotia in 1846, <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> an {{engagement}} {{that he had}} contracted at age 17 with {{the daughter of a}} wealthy Halifax merchant, and instead married Frances Morse (1826–1912), the granddaughter of Colonel Joseph Morse, a founder of Amherst, Nova Scotia. The Tuppers had three sons (Orin Stewart, Charles Hibbert, and William Johnston) and three daughters (Emma, Elizabeth Stewart (Lilly), and Sophy Almon). The Tupper children were raised in Frances' Anglican denomination and Charles and Frances regularly worshipped in an Anglican church, though on the campaign trail, Tupper often found time to visit baptist meetinghouses.|$|E
25|$|World War I {{caused a}} {{conflict}} of loyalties for Charles Edward, but he finally decided to support Germany. <b>He</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> relations with his family at the British and Belgian courts. This did not suffice to overcome doubts about his loyalties in Germany. Charles Edward served {{on the staff of}} an infantry division {{at the beginning of the}} war, but in 1915 had to stop due to rheumatism. Although he never held a command, he visited both the western and eastern fronts numerous times. Soldiers from his duchies were awarded the Carl-Eduard-Kriegskreuz. In 1915, King George V ordered his name removed from the register of the Knights of the Garter.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{more was}} said. For the first time, perhaps, in their lives, the family sat round the breakfast-table in painful silence. Mr. Vanstone's hearty morning appetite, like his hearty morning spirits, was gone. <b>He</b> absently <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> some morsels of dry toast from the rack near him, absently {{finished}} his first cup of tea--then {{asked for a}} second, which he left before him untouched.|$|R
2500|$|Cocea unsuccessfully {{presented}} {{himself as a}} Social Democratic candidate in the elections of 1912, the first ones in Romania to be contested by an independent socialist party. However, <b>he</b> soon <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> from the party, and came {{to be considered a}} representative of the [...] "bourgeois press" [...] by his former socialist colleagues. One of them, Constantin Titel Petrescu, informs that Cocea [...] "could not live by the party discipline".|$|R
5000|$|After {{the death}} of his first wife, Philipp Reinhard was engaged with Elisabeth Louise Christine of Mauchenheim named Bechtolsheim, a lady in waiting of his first wife. He {{intended}} to marry her after she had been elevated to countess. Both his relatives and his councillors opposed the marriage on the grounds that she was of lower birth. <b>He</b> then <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> the engagement and bought her off with money ...|$|R
25|$|The 56th {{experienced}} {{its first}} combat on April 29, losing two planes and pilots, but Johnson was not {{scheduled for the}} mission and did not resume missions until May 3. On May 14 he encountered Luftwaffe aircraft {{for the first time}} on a mission to escort Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses to bomb Antwerp, damaging two Focke Wulf Fw 190s that had broken up his squadron's formation but becoming separated from the group. Finding himself alone, <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> the engagement and returned to base to find that he had been erroneously reported as missing in action. On May 19, as part of a diversionary mission, his flight was ambushed by German fighters, but again the inexperienced Johnson was able to elude them.|$|E
25|$|In 409 Olympius fell {{to further}} intrigue, having his ears cut off {{before he was}} beaten to death. Alaric tried again to {{negotiate}} with Honorius, but his demands (now even more moderate, only frontier land and food) were inflated by the messenger and Honorius responded with insults, which were reported verbatim to Alaric. <b>He</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> negotiations and the standoff continued. Honorius's court made overtures to the usurper Constantine III in Gaul and arranged to bring Hunnic forces into Italy, Alaric ravaged Italy outside the fortified cities (which he could not garrison), and the Romans refused open battle (for which they had inadequate forces). Late in the year Alaric sent bishops to express his readiness to leave Italy if Honorius would only grant his people a supply of grain. Honorius, sensing weakness, flatly refused.|$|E
25|$|Around {{this time}} he {{divorced}} Marjorie, and on 13 October 1949, married Ingaret Giffard. Before he married Ingaret, he had become engaged to Fleur Kohler-Baker, {{the daughter of a}} prominent farmer and businessman, who was 17 years old; they had met on a ship and had had an intense but brief affair of love letters; she was shocked when <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> the relationship. He went on a honeymoon with Ingaret to Switzerland, where his new wife introduced him to Carl Jung. Jung was to have probably a greater influence upon him than anybody else, and he later said that he had never met anyone of Jung's stature. He continued to work on a travel book about his Nyasaland adventures called Venture to the Interior, which became an immediate best-seller in the US and Europe on its publication in 1952.|$|E
60|$|Coming {{into that}} upstairs room that was {{common to all}} the troupe, he found M. Binet talking loudly and vehemently. He had caught sounds of his voice whilst yet upon the stairs. As <b>he</b> entered Binet <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> short, and wheeled to face him.|$|R
60|$|Quest was {{the first}} to cross the room. From the table to the outside window was one charred, black line which had burnt its way through the carpet. He threw open the window. The wire whose course he had {{followed}} ended there with a little lump of queer substance. <b>He</b> <b>broke</b> it <b>off</b> {{from the end of the}} wire, which was absolutely brittle, and brought it into the room.|$|R
50|$|Wittgenstein {{would not}} meet the Vienna Circle proper, {{but only a few}} of its members, {{including}} Schlick, Carnap, and Waissman. Often, though, he refused to discuss philosophy, and would insist on giving the meetings over to reciting the poetry of Rabindranath Tagore with his chair turned to the wall. <b>He</b> largely <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> formal relations even with these members of the circle after coming to believe Carnap had used some of his ideas without permission.|$|R
25|$|At {{the age of}} 16 (in 1909), Stutchkoff had {{his first}} {{experience}} with Yiddish theatre. <b>He</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> his traditional religious schooling to join the theatre company of the cultural organisation Hazomir (Hebrew for “nightingale”), led by the author Isaac Leib Peretz. He gave his acting debut in Sholem Aleichem’s Mentshn (“Humans”) {{and went on to}} act with different troupes in Poland and Russia. In 1912 he was drafted for military service. After his release he was hired by Adolf Segal and from 1917 on he played at the Undzer vinkl theatre in Kharkiv (now Ukraine), which maintained a lively theatre scene in spite of the First World War and subsequently, the Russian Civil War. In 1921 the company was incorporated in a state theatre company which led to the group’s break up. Stutchkoff joined the Yiddish State Theatre of Vitebsk (now Belarus). In 1923 he emigrated to the United States – with his wife Tsilye and his son Misha, born in 1918.|$|E
25|$|Bowen was at Gibraltar {{when news}} of Jervis's {{victory at the}} Battle of Cape St Vincent arrived. He {{immediately}} set out to join the fleet, and having fallen in with several other British frigates, including , came across the Spanish first rate Santísima Trinidad. The Spanish ship was flying the Union Jack above her own colours, indicating {{that she was in}} the hands of a British prize-crew, but the bad weather meant no meaningful exchange could take place between the frigates and the Spanish vessel, and it was suspected that the British colours were being used as a ruse de guerre. After the frigates lost sight of the ship in bad weather, Bowen hurried to report the sighting to Jervis. While returning to his station he again fell in with the Santísima Trinidad, and determined to see if she would surrender to him. He opened fire on the massive Spanish vessel, at the time the world's largest warship, carrying 136-guns on four decks, over a hundred more guns than the Terpsichore. The Spanish ship resisted Bowen's fire, and <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> the attack. It was later discovered that Bowen's attack had killed nine men, and left a number of others badly wounded.|$|E
25|$|The {{second day}} began in an {{explosive}} fashion. While the first over {{of the day}} (bowled by Agarkar to Adam Gilchrist) yielded only 3 runs, the second over {{was the one that}} set the tone for a day which was morbidly frustrating for the bowlers and was heavily in favour of the batsmen. The second over of the day(Ashish Nehra to Gilchrist), and the 92nd over of the Australian innings fetched 12 runs. The scoring sequence was as follows: 3–0–0–1–4–4. But in the 96th over, Agarkar managed to stop the Gilchrist juggernaut when he had him to offer a catch to Sehwag for 29, made from only 24 balls. Australia, were still looking strong at 426/5 with Ponting still around for an undefeated 182. Ponting was moving sedately at a rather sluggish pace ever since he had reached 150, and seemed considerably slow before <b>he</b> <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> the shackles with two elegant and sweetly timed boundaries off Nehra in the 103rd over. Five balls later, Ponting brought up his double century of a mere 289 balls with another exquisite drive to the fence. When he reached his 200, he paused to blow a kiss to his wife. He had not only scored his second double century in what happened to be a prolific year for him, but also had stitched a valuable partnership with Andy Bichel, who had scored a gutsy 19 from 45 balls before Kumble had him dismissed. The Australians, though, gave the Indian bowlers and fielders no respite, as Jason Gillespie and Ponting came together to add a partnership of 83 runs, with Gillespie making merry with 48 from 53 balls, and Ponting had already raced to 242 from 350 balls by then. However, operating in his 43rd over, Kumble first got rid of Ponting and then picked up the remaining two Australian wickets off the last two balls of that over as well. This put a huge dent on the Australian hopes of making a 600-plus score.|$|E
6000|$|... "May I {{have the}} pleasure...?" [...] <b>he</b> began, then <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> as <b>he</b> {{saw the man}} who had come out of the box behind his hostess. [...] "Underhill!"

60|$|He {{heard the}} clock strike nine, then half-past, {{from the village}} behind. The {{children}} would be asleep. His wife was sitting sewing some little frock. He went lingering down the garden path, stooping to lift the fallen carnations, {{to see how they}} were. There were many flowers, but small. <b>He</b> <b>broke</b> one <b>off,</b> then threw it away. The golden rod was out. Even in the little lawn there were asters, as of old.|$|R
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to force an action, Hood {{spent most of the}} next day {{struggling}} to get his ships to windward, but finding two of his fleet too damaged to sail properly, <b>he</b> eventually <b>broke</b> <b>off</b> in a northerly direction. Rodney, who had left StEustatius earlier that day in Sandwich with the 74-gun [...] and the hurriedly repaired Russell, met with Hood on 11May between St Kitts and Antigua. The reunited fleet turned south, putting into Barbados on 18May.|$|R
