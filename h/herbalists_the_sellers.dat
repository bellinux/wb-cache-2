50|$|Typically, {{the real}} estate agent has the {{experience}} and data to determine a suitable listing price for <b>the</b> <b>seller's</b> property and will recommend a listing price to <b>the</b> <b>seller.</b> <b>The</b> <b>seller</b> can accept, reject, or try to negotiate a different listing price for the contract. If <b>the</b> <b>seller's</b> price is unrealistically high and the agent cannot convince <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> otherwise, <b>the</b> agent can decline to list the property.|$|R
50|$|A hire {{purchase}} agreement, {{also known as}} an instalment sale, allows the purchase {{price to be paid}} in instalments after delivery of the hired property.

But, if <b>the</b> <b>Seller</b> feels that <b>the</b> Player is bluffing, he would keep on increasing his bid. If the final amount agreed by the Player is not satisfactory to <b>the</b> <b>Seller,</b> he may give a misleading answer to the Player (remember <b>the</b> <b>Seller</b> would anyway get the agreed amount whether the answer is right or wrong).

40|$|A {{real estate}} {{developer}} sells a recently constructed office building to a public real estate "blind pool " syndication. Because the property is not yet fully occupied, the general partner of the syndication negotiates a master leaseback agreement with <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> at <b>the</b> date of the sale. Under {{the terms of the}} agreement, the syndication pays a fee to <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> and <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> leases <b>the</b> vacant space at a market rate, at the sale date, for a two-year period. This payment is described as a fee in exchange for signing a master lease or as an escrowed portion of the purchase price. The syndication will relieve <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> of its future lease payment obligations on space <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> subsequently subleases to others if the sublease meets certain criteria. If <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> is unable to lease the vacant space during the two-year period, the rental payments to the syndication would substantially exceed the fee paid by the syndication. The issue is how the syndication should account for the fee it pays <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> and <b>the</b> rent it receives from <b>the</b> <b>seller.</b> (<b>The</b> <b>seller's</b> accounting is not addressed.) EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that payments to and receipts from <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> should be treated by the syndication as adjustments to the basis of the property and will affect future depreciation.

Similarly, manufacturers of products often wish to cover <b>the</b> <b>sellers</b> of <b>the</b> products as additional insureds under the manufacturer's liability policies. This helps induce <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> to promote <b>the</b> sale of the products, because <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> knows that any product liability lawsuit against <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> will be covered by the manufacturer's liability insurance.|$|R
40|$|In case of {{a merger}} or an acquisition, a tort {{liability}} that arises from <b>the</b> <b>seller's</b> conduct is often imposed on the buyer through the doctrine of successor liability.

This paper examines the case in which the bidder is better informed about the quality of his match with <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> than <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> is. We derive the optimal mechanism for this setting and investigate whether <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> requires commitment power to implement it. It is shown that once the reserve price is set, it is optimal for <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> to do away with any matching considerations and allocate the contract on the basis of price alone. If matching is sufficiently important to <b>the</b> <b>seller,</b> <b>the</b> optimal mechanism may be implemented without commitment. However, if matching is not sufficiently important, <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> suffers a loss when he is unable to commit. The magnitude of this loss increases as the importance of matching decreases. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>seller</b> is {{not liable}} for any {{unlawful}} {{interference with the}} buyer's possession.

Eviction, therefore, does not include situations where the sale is set aside by the court, or if the property is attached by <b>the</b> <b>seller's</b> creditors before ownership passed.|$|R
40|$|When <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> of {{an asset}} grants a right-of-first-refusal to a buyer, this special buyer has the {{opportunity}} to purchase the asset at the best price <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> can obtain from the other potential buyers. We show that the right-of-first-refusal is inefficient, and it benefits the special buyer at the expense of <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> and other buyers. In a private values model, the benefit the special buyer obtains via the right-of-first-refusal equals the cost to <b>the</b> <b>seller.</b> When buyers' valuations are correlated, the presence of a special buyer exacerbates the winner's curse on regular buyers. Consequently, the special buyer's expected gain from the right-of-first-refusal is often less than the expected loss to <b>the</b> <b>seller.</b> Thus, our analysis suggests that <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> should exercise considerable caution prior to deciding whether to grant this right to a buyer. ...|$|R
50|$|As soon as {{eviction}} is threatened, {{the buyer}} {{is required to}} give <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> notice of <b>the</b> third party's claim to possession of <b>the</b> thing. <b>The</b> <b>seller</b> has to be given adequate notice to fulfil his obligation to protect the buyer's possession. The duties of <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> are somewhat unclear, {{but it seems that}} he is expected to intervene in the action, and take up the defence against the other party claiming title. It is <b>the</b> <b>seller's</b> duty under <b>the</b> warranty to relieve the buyer of the risks and costs of court action. If the buyer fails to give the necessary notice, he has no recourse against <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> unless he can prove that the third party's right is incontestable, or that it is <b>the</b> <b>seller's</b> fault that <b>the</b> notice did not reach him in time.|$|R

This paper seeks to {{determine}} what measures <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> should take to maximize his share of the surplus when bidders are privately informed about their risk of default. Special attention is paid to the effect of imposing a default penalty, the value of gathering information about each bidder's default risk, and the role of commitment. It is shown that the value of gathering information is negligible when <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> has commitment power and negative when <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> lacks commitment power. When <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> is informed about each bidder's risk, <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> benefits from <b>the</b> ability to commit. However, when <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> is uninformed, he is able to capture nearly all the surplus independent of whether or not he has commitment power. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies a selling {{mechanism}} where <b>the</b> <b>seller</b> first {{charges a}} fee for advice (information structure) then sells a product.

Our objective is to determine whether it is in <b>the</b> <b>seller's</b> interest to observe the matches before selecting the winner. It is shown that <b>the</b> <b>seller’s</b> value for <b>the</b> information may be negative: <b>the</b> <b>seller’s</b> knowledge of <b>the</b> matches generates an asymmetry across bidders which depresses bids.
