Three laps later he made a similar mistake at the same turn, resulting in him sliding across the grass {{for the third time}} in the race. This caused him to drop back to fourth as it allowed Massa to go round the inside of Alonso into third.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{typically}} {{breed in}} small groups: the Mascarene martin builds a shallow cup nest of twigs and coarse plant material {{with a soft}} inner lining, whereas Brazza's martin makes a small heap of soft material such as feathers or dry <b>grass</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of a}} typically 50-cm (20-in) tunnel in a riverbank. The normal clutch is three eggs for Brazza's martin, two for Mascarene martins on Madagascar and Mauritius, and two or three for those on Réunion. As with other swallows, both martins feed on flying insects, hunting in single-species groups or with other swallows and swifts.|$|E

5|$|The {{team was}} owned by the Argonaut Rowing Club for its first 83 years, and has been owned {{by a series of}} {{business}} interests since 1956. The Argonauts were a fixture on the Toronto sports scene for decades, with attendance peaking in the 1970s. In May 2015 it was announced that a consortium of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment's Larry Tanenbaum (via the Kilmer Group) and Bell Canada would acquire the team. The sale included a scheduled move to MLSE run BMO Field for the 2016 season, which has long been proposed given attendance under-utilization at Rogers Centre and plans to install natural <b>grass</b> <b>at</b> the domed stadium, rendering it unfit for football.|$|E
5|$|When {{it reaches}} the pouch, the {{underdeveloped}} joey suckles the teat {{of one of the}} four mammary glands while the others recede. The joey remains attached to the teat for 100–125 days, after which it ceases its attachment but remains in the pouch and continues to suckle, but more intermittently. The joey begins to leave the pouch and eat <b>grass</b> <b>at</b> around 200 days when it is more developed. It still suckles, more forcefully but less regularly. By 250 days, the joey no longer needs the pouch, and it is fully weaned at around 300–350 days. The tammar wallaby has been observed to engage in alloparental care, in which an adult may adopt another's young. Male tammars may live for around 11 years, while females live for 14 years.|$|E
5|$|Another {{round of}} green flag pit stops {{commenced}} after {{three hours and}} eight minutes with Tréluyer being {{the first of the}} leaders to stop with both Toyota cars following two minutes later. The safety car was deployed when Nakajima's right-front tyre failed on the Wellington straight following contact with a LMGTE car and debris from his Toyota was littered on the track. Nakajima pulled {{over to the side of}} the circuit at Brooklands corner and stopped. Marshals were required to remove the debris from the track. The safety car drove into the pit lane 12 minutes later and racing resumed with Tréluyer remaining in first and Lieb second. Nakajima's car was transported back into his garage for repairs. Dumas turned into Franchitti's Ford and half-spun into the <b>grass</b> <b>at</b> Club corner, losing more than ten seconds to Tréluyer. Dumas was forced wide into the Woodcote corner run-off area by Rao and Rees overtook Franchitti for fifth in LMGTE Pro. After serving an earlier three-minute stop-and-go penalty for changing the car's engine Calado was running in third place in LMGTE Pro while Buemi drove the No. 5 Toyota back onto the circuit after his car was repaired. Tréluyer made a pit stop for fuel and tyres with Fässler taking over the No. 7 car. Fässler was followed by Lieb making a pit stop from the lead and handed driving duties to Jani. Fässler thus retook the lead with a nine-second advantage.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the second}} round of pit stops, Räikkönen was five seconds ahead of Hamilton, but Hamilton began to close in on Räikkönen during the last stint {{as a result of the}} tyres better suiting his McLaren Mercedes. Heavy rain began to fall on lap41. Hamilton closed the gap on Räikkönen to under a second, still sixseconds ahead of Massa. Hamilton {{attempted}} to pass Räikkönen at the Bus Stop chicane, but he cut across the corner. Consequently, Hamilton led out of the chicane but allowed Räikkönen to re-pass him halfway down the straight. Hamilton then passed him again at the La Source hairpin under braking. Räikkönen tried to double-back on Hamilton to regain the position but the line was defended, resulting in Räikkönen touching his front wing on Hamilton's rear tyre. The rain started coming down more heavily and Nico Rosberg spun at Fagnes corner, rejoining in front of the two frontrunners and causing Hamilton to run onto the <b>grass.</b> <b>At</b> the next corner, Räikkönen spun and gave the lead back to Hamilton. Räikkönen then lost control of his Ferrari through the Blanchimont corner and collided with the barrier, ending his race.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, {{a project}} was started to bring Bodø/Glimt {{back to the}} top league. Among the most {{important}} issues was to secure better training facilities, particularly during the Arctic winter. The club proposed upgrading the artificial turf field at Aspmyra with a new field with under-soil heating, in addition to constructing both a new gravel pitch and an indoor training hall with a full-size pitch. The Municipal Committee for Sport and Culture stated that they wanted to prioritize the artificial turf field over a gravel pitch. They therefore proposed that NOK3.5 million be allocated to lay under-soil heating on the artificial turf pitch and remove the turf. New artificial turf would be laid at a later date, when funding could be allocated. This was agreed upon, construction started on 24 October 1989 and was scheduled for completion ahead of the winter training. However, the Football Association of Norway (NFF) stated that the club {{would not be allowed to}} play their matches on a gravel pitch, and the <b>grass</b> <b>at</b> Aspmyra was in so bad condition that it would not be permitted for play in the top league, should the team be promoted. The municipal council therefore gave grants to finance a new artificial turf on the training pitch, which was taken into use in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} allowed Jani to {{move into}} the lead but di Grassi stopped at Farm Curve with a motor generator unit problem shortly afterwards. His team's mechanics were allowed to tend to the Audi after travelling via a course car, extending the full course yellow as it was tended to. Di Grassi's race ended prematurely and one of the mechanics used a fire extinguisher to extinguish smoke bellowing from his car. The race resumed after 23 minutes with Tréluyer attacking Lieb, and upon being delayed by the No. 13 Rebellion Racing car, passed him {{to move into}} the lead on the approach to Maggots corner and pulled away on the Hangar straight. Rast stopped at the entrance of Maggots corner with a fuel pump pressure failure, causing him to lose the LMP2 lead to Watts and rejoined the field in third place in class. Rast recovered and passed Senna for second in LMP2 by using the <b>grass</b> <b>at</b> Stowe corner. Tréluyer was blocked by slower traffic allowing Lieb to close up to him on the Wellington straight. Lieb could not overtake because he was delayed by a pack of LMP2 cars. Rast closed up to Watts and overtook him to retake the LMP2 lead. Tréluyer and Lieb ran closely between each other before the former pulled away from Lieb.|$|E

5|$|The {{race was}} {{restarted}} on lap 26, {{and on the}} approach to the hairpin later in the lap Robert Kubica hit the back of Jarno Trulli's Toyota. The impact forced Kubica onto the <b>grass</b> <b>at</b> {{the edge of the}} track, where a bump launched his car into and along the concrete wall just before the hairpin. After losing three wheels, the nose and suffering major damage to the sidepods in the initial impact, the BMW flipped back across the track and came to rest against the barrier in the run-off area {{on the other side of}} the track. Although initial reports said that he had broken his leg, Kubica only suffered a sprained ankle and concussion. The safety car was deployed again after this crash. The safety car was also deployed on lap 50, due to debris from a crash involving Christijan Albers on the previous lap, and on lap 55 due to Vitantonio Liuzzi crashing into the wall of champions once again.|$|E
5|$|Tréluyer {{was delayed}} by slower traffic, {{allowing}} Conway to overtake him for fourth position before the Audi driver ran wide at the Bus Stop chicane. Van der Garde's car's sustained a damaged mirror and was ordered by race control {{to have it}} repaired at his scheduled pit stop. Buemi closed the gap to Lucas di Grassi in Audi's No. 8 entry and attempted to pass him driving into Eau Rouge and Raidillon but di Grassi was able to pull away on the Kemmel Straight. Buemi moved to the outside line at Blanchimont and moved in front of di Grassi, who went through <b>grass,</b> <b>at</b> the Bus Stop chicane for second place. Marino Franchitti's No. 67 Ford made contact with Aguas's car at Les Combes but both drivers were able to continue, although Augas lost the LMGTE Am lead. Conway locked his tyres and collided heavily with Victor Shaytar's delayed No. 37 SMP Racing car going into the Bus Stop chicane while attempting {{to close the gap}} to di Grassi. Conway immediately drove into the pit lane for repairs to his car's front-end. Both Porsche cars made pit stops after 49 minutes which saw Jani taking over Lieb's driving duties while Hartley switched positions with Bernhard.|$|E
5|$|Upfront, the No. 5 Toyota {{increased}} its lead over the No. 8 Audi to 38.778 seconds, {{while the first}} Audi moved into 12th position. The No. 1 Porsche returned to the pit lane {{for a change of}} front axel and fell down the order in LMP1 because of different tyre speeds of the vehicle's front wheels. G-Drive's No. 38 entry was issued with a two-minute stop-and-go penalty for its role in the collision with the No. 95 Aston Martin. Fässler nearly placed Davidson into the <b>grass</b> <b>at</b> Stavelot while lapping Extreme Speed Motorsports's Ligier. Fässler entered the pit lane for replacement front bodywork. Gulf's Porsche entry spun after contact with Emmanuel Collard's Ferrari at Rivage. The second full course caution was later necessitated when debris was located on three sections of the track. Davidson remained the leader at the restart, ahead of Duval, and immediately increased his advantage over the Audi driver. The No. 7 car hit the No. 36 Alpine at La Source, causing the latter to spin. The third round of pit stops commenced shortly afterwards when Audi and Toyota made their stops for fuel and driver changes. Kraihamer's No. 13 Rebellion Racing vehicle hit the LMP2 leader Tor Graves in the No. 44 Manor Oreca and his car was beached on La Source's apex {{for a long period of}} time before rejoining the event.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the mid-18th century planting, {{although}} there remains, in front of the house, a gnarled black mulberry tree, which was described as ancient in 1822. However, 19th-century drawings and photographs record increasingly elaborate and fussy bedding schemes, finally swept away in the 1960s. Today there is a more informal style, emphasising the architectural character of the garden with its long straight sweeps of wall; it is also an easier style to maintain. In recent years, native wild plants have been allowed to mingle with rare and exotic specimens and continual thought is being given to contrasting textures and colours of foliage. The lower garden, below the front of the house, now has the air of a small arboretum with a number of fine specimen trees, such as a splendid late-leafing catalpa (an oriental plane tree) dominates this part of the garden and the <b>grass</b> <b>at</b> its foot is left uncut during the Spring, allowing camassias and bluebells to make a fine showing.|$|E
