[...] She {{is considered to}} be the first Mexican-American author and the first Mexican-American author to write in English. María Ruiz de Burton was important in literature because she addressed crucial issues of ethnicity, power, gender, class and race in her writing. Her life and writings demonstrate the historical contradictions of the Mexican American identity. Her writing shows a variety of influences; historical romance is often seen in British, French, Spanish and Mexican works while her realism and naturalism mirrors American writing. Her works challenge traditional American and Mexican American literary histories” because they “openly critiqued northeastern materialism and portrayed California’s land-holding Mexicans as a genteel, white population wrongfully displaced in the United States by racism and corrupt politics. She is a Chicano author not just because of her race but because her novels investigate issues at the core of Chicano/a history and literature: identification, <b>disidentification,</b> dual nationality, citizenship, latinidad, and gender constraints. Even writing and publishing this book was an act of empowerment for the Californios. One of the most noteworthy aspects of Ruiz de Burton is her “sense of identification and nationality, her sense of displacement, her contradictory accommodation to and <b>disidentification</b> with the united States, her sense of a ‘Latin’ race beyond national identify and citizenship” ...|$|E

In Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability, Robert McRuer, draws on Muñoz's theory of <b>disidentification</b> to articulate and imagine [...] "collective disidentifications" [...] made possible when putting queer and crip theory in conversation. Diana Taylor, Ann Cvetkovich, Roderick Ferguson, and Jack Halberstam have cited and applied Muñoz {{to their own}} work. Muñoz was also influential {{to the field of}} Queer of Color Critique. In the book Aberrations in Black, Roderick Ferguson employs Muñoz's <b>disidentification</b> theory to reveal how the discourses of sexuality are used to articulate theories of racial difference in the field of sociology. Moreover, <b>disidentification</b> theory has been used by an array of scholars to apply a queer of color critique to various themes such as identity politics, queer temporality, homonationalism, and diaspora and native studies.|$|E
5000|$|Muñoz's {{theory of}} <b>disidentification</b> builds on Michel Pêcheux's {{understanding}} of <b>disidentification</b> and subject formation by examining how minoritarian subjects, those whose identities render them a minority (i.e. queer people of color), negotiate identity in a majoritarian world that punishes, {{and attempts to}} erase the existence of, {{those who do not}} fit the normative subject (i.e.heterosexual, cisgender, white, middle class, male). Muñoz notes how queer people of color, {{as a result of the}} effects of colonialism have been placed outside dominant racial and sexual ideology, namely white normativity and heteronormativity. In his own words, [...] "disidentification is about managing and negotiating historical trauma and systemic violence." [...] The disidentificatory subject does not assimilate (identify) nor reject (counter identify) dominant ideology. Rather, the disidentificatory subject employs a third strategy, and, [...] "tactically and simultaneously works on, with, and against, a cultural form." [...] Aside from being a process of identification, <b>disidentification</b> is also a survival strategy. Through <b>disidentification,</b> the disidentifying subject is able to rework the cultural codes of the mainstream to read themselves into the mainstream, a simultaneous insertion and subversion. By the mode of <b>disidentification,</b> queer subjects are directed towards the future. Through the use of shame and [...] "misrecognition through failed interpellation, queer collectivity neither assimilates nor strictly opposes the dominant regime," [...] but works on strategies that result in queer counterpublics.|$|E

5000|$|In <b>Disidentifications,</b> Muñoz defines counterpublics as [...] "communities and {{relational}} chains of resistance that contest the dominant public sphere." [...] Counterpublics {{have the capacity}} of world-making {{through a series of}} cultural performances that disidentify with the normative scripts of whiteness, heternormativity, and misogyny. Counterpublics disrupt social scripts and create through their work an opening of possibility for other visions of the world that map different, utopian social relations. Muñoz suggests that such work is vital for queer people of color subjects survival and possibilities for another world. At the center of counterpublic performances is the idea of educated hope, [...] "which is both critical affect and methodology." [...] Jack Halberstam in the book In a Queer Time & Place, discusses the role of Drag king culture as a form of counterpublics that validate and produce [...] "minoritarian public spheres" [...] {{at the same time they}} challenge white heteronormativity.

50|$|Ratcliffe {{draws upon}} Diane Fuss because Fuss expands Burke’s theory of {{identification}} to gear toward examining {{the differences in}} identificaion. Fuss defines Identification as related {{to the issue of}} connection between opposite entities, such as the interrelation between self and other, subject and object, and insiders and outsiders. For Fuss, identification is difficult to pinpoint, as the distinction between opposite entities is porous, oftentimes “impossibly confused and finally untenable.” Fuss further builds the connection between identification and <b>disidentification.</b> Fuss defines <b>disidentification</b> as contingent on previous identification with another group, no matter how stereotypical the identification is, {{while at the same time}} the identification has receded from the subconscious. Ratcliffe argues that previously identification has been configured as a metaphor, which is manifested in Burke’s consubstantiality and Fuss’s (<b>dis)identification.</b> Ratcliffe notes that metaphor has been used to function as the dominant trope for identification; however, metaphor foregrounds commonalities more than differences. Ratcliff suggests theorizing identification via the use of metonymy to counter the privilege of communality. Intrinsic to the trope of metonymy is an attention to both commonalities and differences.|$|E

In particular, I analyze its retrospective narrative structure and its use of what Roland Barthes called a “hermeneutic code” (i. e., the primacy of a cognitive quest rather than a quest for identity); its multiple, fragmented versions of the core story, and the aesthetic and ideological implications of such multiplicity and fragmentation (which, to my mind, unsettle linearity and genealogies both at the textual level and as regards the issues of identity and ethnicity); its use of language and imagery in ways that, while retaining a deep cultural resonance and representativeness, deviate from those more customary to the Asian American novel and look to modern and postmodern textuality and metatextuality. By investigating the novel’s complex set of identifications and <b>disidentifications</b> with the Asian American autobiographical tradition {{on the one hand and}} the mainstream modernist aesthetics of selection and control on the other hand, I highlight Ng’s effective anti-essentialistic rewriting of the (Chinese) American novel as an open, multilayered, and contested literary field...|$|R

The project takes a intersectional approach to exploring these dynamics by interrogating how various positionalities (e. g. “race”, disability, class etc.) interact with queer feminine genders and sexualities. Synthesising insights from Sara Ahmed’s (2006) queer phenomenology regarding processes of orientation with José Esteban Muñoz’s (1999) theory of <b>disidentifications,</b> the project explores the possibilities that experiences and articulations of queer feminine disidentificatory orientations offer for a critical take on queer femininities from within. The key research question that this project addresses is: How and why are disidentificatory orientations experienced by various differently positioned queer feminine subjects and what can queer feminine disidentificatory orientations tell us about dynamics of inclusion, exclusion and (un) belonging within queer feminine subjectivities, communities and representations? The project developed a collaborative queer fem(me) inist ethnographic approach that combined questionnaires, interviews and visual materials (collages and photographs) produced by a diverse sample of 15 queer feminine participants in the UK, with insights gained from a discursive analysis of three major contemporary femme anthologies: Chloë Brushwood Rose and Anna Camilleri’s (2002) Brazen Femme, Ulrika Dahl and Del LaGrace Volcano’s (2008) Femmes of Power and Jennifer Clare Burke’s (2009) Visible. The project presents a significant new data set which demonstrates the complexities, politics and cultures of femme subjectivities and the ranges of (sub) cultural capitals {{that one has to}} either already be invested in, or actively invest in, to access queer feminine identities, recognition and community belonging. Thus, the project argues for the continued necessity of engaging in positioned reflexive work on the lived experiences of minority subjects within our own queer, feminist and femme communities...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: My {{research}} {{is motivated by}} concerns with promoting „transformation‟ in Stellenbosch University, a formerly white Afrikaans University which is still predominantly white in terms of numbers and proportions of students attending the institution. While I argue {{about the importance of}} taking measures to promote more „diverse‟ student populations, I am critical of discourses which equate transformation with „improving‟ demographic profiles defined in terms of numbers of black, white, coloured and Indian students. I argue that understandings of transformation and diversity need to engage with the students‟ views and experiences of the university in order to make meaningful change with regard to social cohesion and integration, which goes beyond statistical change. My research does this by exploring how students from particular residences, in Stellenbosch University, construct and experience university and residence life and their own identifications. The students were interviewed in friendship groups, selected by the students themselves, and a key concern of mine was to facilitate conversations with them on broad themes relating to their reasons for coming to Stellenbosch and their interests, aspirations, motivations, identifications and <b>disidentifications</b> as particular students in particular residences in Stellenbosch. I was particularly concerned to pick up on issues which the students raised in these „focus group discussions‟ so that the students, themselves, {{played a key role in}} setting the agenda in the discussion and they and their reflections on their experiences and constructions of themselves and others became the topic of discussion. Rather than taking the group interview as an „instrument‟ (as interviews, like questionnaires, are often described in methods texts in the social sciences), I write about it as ethnographic encounter involving them and myself as participants, and I explore insights about the nature of their friendships and relationships derived from first-hand experience, of how they engage with their selected friends and with me in the research group. Furthermore, by engaging with them as authorities about their lives and identifications as particular kinds of students at Stellenbosch, and posing questions which encouraged them to reflect on these. I argue that this kind of research can itself become a model of good pedagogic and „transformative‟ practice. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Nie beskikbaa...|$|R

50|$|Laura Sjoberg {{advocates for}} allying trans-theorizing and feminist theorizing in IR. She {{suggests}} some possible improvements that trans-theorizing may offer for feminist IR theory, {{which include a}} more nuanced understanding of gender hierarchy through a pluralist approach to sex, a holistic view of gender that resists viewing gender entirely either as a social construction or as biologically essential, and an increased awareness of gender as involving power relations among different sexes and genders. Additionally, Sjoberg argues, trans-theorizing makes important contributions to traditional IR’s understanding of global politics. Discussions of ‘outness,’ visibility, invisibility, and hypervisibility in transgender theorizing are applicable to questions of identity, relations between individuals and groups, and the enforcement of norms in IR. Additionally, transgender understandings of transition and liminality can fill the gap in traditional IR’s need for an account of change and unrest in the international system. Moreover, talk of “crossing” and “passing” in trans-theorizing may assist in explaining the process, logic, and consequences of states shifting identities. Finally, transgender <b>disidentification,</b> either from exclusionary movements or from their assigned sex, can help in unpacking “the problem of difference” in international relations. As such, Sjoberg advocates {{for the inclusion of}} trans-theorizing in feminist IR theory in the interests of improving explanations and understandings of global politics.|$|E

The concept of legitimate goals is considered as an essential variable that may be adversely affected by the presence of academic <b>disidentification.</b> A qualitative analysis utilizing a grounded theory approach resulted in a theoretical model, Facilitation of Legitimate Goals, positing two developmental paths toward internalizing legitimate goals. Twenty previously incarcerated African American males were interviewed to explore their satisfaction with their lives since incarceration, the past and present value they have associated with formal education, and the types of goals they currently pursue. The model emerging from the participants' data indicated a negative cycle in which academic <b>disidentification</b> acted as an intervening condition for high-risk activities that led to incarceration for each participant.

Yet most models are unable to account for the academic underperformance of African American students across social categories and contexts. ^ <b>Disidentification</b> theory has broader utility than many explanations of academic underachievement. Supporting research suggests that stereotype threat is a common factor in the schooling experience of African Americans that erodes academic outcomes. Stereotype threat is the event of a negative stereotype of one 2 ̆ 7 s group being perceived as self-relevant and potentially harming performance. Previous studies have suggested that stereotype threat causes lowered school performance. Studies have also shown that stereotype threat leads to academic disidentification: a phenomenon in which the student makes academic identity less important to overall self-definition (Steele and Aronson 1995; Osbourne 1995). ^ In this study, I investigate the effects of stereotype threat on a racially diverse sample of high school students in the Northeast. Unlike most <b>disidentification</b> research, I employ self-report measures of stereotype threat. I also investigate the moderating effects of racial identity and gender on the effects of stereotype threat. The results offer support for the major ideas of <b>disidentification</b> theory. Specifically, the study finds that stereotype threat diminishes the school related self-concept of African American students. It also finds that stereotype threat exacts a negative toll on the academic engagement of African American and Latino students, and that racial identity and gender do not moderate the effect of stereotype threat on academic engagement. ...|$|E

However, when the in-group is framed negatively, mortality salience {{should lead to}} <b>disidentification.</b> Study 1 found that mortality salience increased women’s perceived similarity to other women except under gender-based stereotype threat. In Study 2, mortality salience and a negative ethnic prime led Hispanic as well as Anglo participants to derogate paintings attributed to Hispanic (but not Anglo-American) artists. Study 3 added a neutral prime condition and used a more direct measure of psychological distancing. Mortality salience and the negative prime led Hispanic participants to view themselves as especially different from a fellow Hispanic. Implications for understanding in-group derogation and <b>disidentification</b> are briefly discussed. Terror management theory (TMT; Greenberg, Pyszczynski, & Solomon, 1986; Solomon, Greenberg, & Pyszczynski, 1991) posits that to function securely {{in the face of}} the uniquely human aware-ness of the inevitability of death, people live their lives embedded in a culturally derived conception of reality that provides meaning to experience and value to themselves. Group identifications are o...|$|E
