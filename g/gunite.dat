5|$|To {{make the}} tunnel water and frost tight, {{the walls were}} covered with {{polyethylene}} mats. Because they are highly flammable, they were then covered in a layer of <b>gunite.</b> Also installed were fire water pipes and ventilation systems to remove smoke. To sound-insulate the tunnel and avoid vibrations spreading to nearby housing, the entire tunnel was covered in a layer of rock wool. By December 2010, the ballast had been laid, and in January 2011 laying of the tracks and ties started. The work to build the tracks and overhead wires has been contracted to Baneservice. The contract for the electro-technical installations was awarded to YIT Building Systems for NOK120 million. As of 2006, the whole section from Lysaker to Sandvika was estimated to cost NOK2.7 billion.|$|E
5|$|On {{a meeting}} on 10 October, O. T. Blindheim, a {{geological}} consulting company, and Selmer presented three alternatives: continued injection of cement, recommended by Blindheim; freezing, recommended by Selmer {{because it was the}} cheapest, but would take more time; and use of a water-tight shield. A technical committee was established, and on 16 December they recommended the use of cement injection combined with a ring of drainage holes around the tunnel before blasting. The method was to be continually tested, and if it was insufficient, freezing could be used. As the tunnel advanced, the hole was to be continuously secured using carbon fibre-reinforced carbon <b>gunite,</b> self-boring bolts, steel ribs and full pouring. Work was taken up after {{a meeting on}} 27 March 1995, and on 16 August the final blast was made. Representatives from Selmer stated that the method they had chosen had resulted in international interest for the tunnel, and they had demonstrated it to several international delegations.|$|E
500|$|Work on {{geological}} {{surveys in}} the area started prior to 2001, with surveys being performed by the Geological Survey of Norway. The contract to build the tunnel and all other earthwork on the section from Solstad to Hønsveien was awarded to Mika, with the tunneling costing NOK425 million. The tunnel was built using the drilling and blasting method using two points of entry, the entrance on the Asker side and from a crosscut at Skaugum. Work started in February 2002 and was concluded in May 2005. Construction involved blasting [...] of earthwork [...] and drilling [...] of holes for pre-injection. The construction used [...] of <b>gunite,</b> [...] of concrete, 24,000 bolts, [...] of water- and frost protection, [...] of noise- and frost isolation and [...] of cable conduit. Near the entrance at Asker, the tunnel is closest to the surface, and is between [...] below the basements of residential houses.

500|$|Geological {{sampling}} {{was undertaken}} by the Norwegian Geological Survey and Grøner, and included both core samples and reflection seismology. Late core samples showed that the tunnel {{would have to be}} located [...] further down than originally planned to avoid deposits. The tunnel construction was awarded to two companies: the contract starting from Dalshovda in Sveio and was worked by the Public Roads Administration, while the tunneling from Føyno was worked by NCC. Both used the drilling and blasting method. NCC was awarded the contract after bidding NOK175 million for the job. Construction from Sveio started on 16 September 1997 and from Føyno on 6 March 1998. In all, [...] of earthwork was extracted. The earthwork from the Føyno side was transported by barge to Austevoll and used to build the Austevoll Bridge. The earthwork from the Sveio side was used to build roads and a golf course in the area. On average, the tunnel was built at a speed of [...] per week, with the record being [...] Between 30 and 40 people worked with the tunneling on each team.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of field monitoring of repair patches in two reinforced concrete highway bridges, Lawns Lane Bridge on the M 1 and Gunthorpe Bridge across the River Trent. The repairs were applied by spraying (<b>guniting)</b> repair materials to compression members of the bridges. The structural members were unpropped during repair and throughout the 60 week monitoring period. The strains in the repair patches were monitored with vibrating-wire gauges. Four different repair materials were investigated whose elastic modulus was greater than that of the substrate concrete (E-rm > E-sub). The results show that efficient repairs are achieved with E-rm> E-sub, the optimum relationship being E-rm > 1. 3 E(sub). This enables the repair material to shed a significant proportion of its shrinkage strain to the substrate, thereby reducing restrained-shrinkage tension. It also enables the repair to attract externally applied load from the substrate in the long term. The effect of creep and shrinkage on the performance of the repair patch is also determined. Overall, the results show that current repair standards have limitations with respect to repair material specifications...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} observing system {{simulation}} experiment examining {{the potential benefits}} of new methane isotopologues measurements for global- and national-scale source and sink inversions. New measurements are expected in the coming years, using quantum cascade laser spectroscopy with sample preconcentration, that will allow observations ofδ 13 C - CH 4 and δD - CH 4 at approximately hourly intervals and higher precision than previously possible. Using model-generated ‘pseudo-data’, we predict the variability that these new systems should encounter in the atmosphere, and estimate the additional uncertainty reduction that should result from their use in source and sink inversions. We find that much of theδ-value variability from seasonal to daily timescales should be resolvable at the target precision of the new observations. For global source estimation, we find additional uncertainty reductions of between 3 – 9 Tg/year for four major source categories (microbial, biomass burning, landfill and fossil fuel), compared to mole fraction-only inversions, if the higher end of the anticipated isotopologue-measurement precisions can be achieved. On national scales, we obtain average uncertainty reductions of ∼ 10 % of the source strength for countries close to high-frequency monitoring sites, although the degree of uncertainty reduction on such small scales varies significantly (from close to 0 % to almost 50 %) for different sources and countries.

50|$|With {{the use of}} precast shapes, crew sizing can be minimized. Speed of {{installation}} {{is another}} obvious benefit to both the installer and the owner, resulting in reduced costs due to shorter job duration. Material usage is also reduced, {{when compared to other}} installation methods such as <b>guniting,</b> where as much as 45% of extra material is required to compensate for rebound and other job losses. Environmental hazards such as dusting and tripping hazards associated with equipment and hoses are also reduced substantially, if not eliminated. Future repairs also become much more economical and quicker to accomplish. Repair areas can be isolated to just the immediate wear area within the boundaries of a shape. Anchor attachment points can typically be reused. Replacement shapes, purchased early and kept as spare parts on site, can be easily installed in a fraction of the time required for conventional repair methods. The initial bake-out of a new refractory lining on site can be a very expensive and time-consuming component of a refractory repair project. The use of precast and prefired refractory shapes can sometimes reduce or even eliminate the need for an extensive initial bake-out. If an entire repair is made with a prefired system, then normal furnace start up schedules can be used, without the fear of steam spalls or other damage during the initial heating. Bake-out of multi-component linings, which may include a combination of precast shapes and other materials placed in the field, can often be reduced by the pre-firing of the castable shapes, particularly if that material would have been the critical item determining the bake out schedule. This can {{have a positive impact on}} not only job costs, but in reducing down time as well.|$|R

50|$|The {{steelwork}} was {{encased in}} <b>Gunite,</b> a sprayed dry mix concrete, {{the process of}} {{which was based on}} an invention in the United States at turn of century to spray plaster of paris in the reconstruction of skeletons of prehistoric animals. Between 1904-1909 this method was modified to spray sand and cement using a machine known as a Cement- Gun. <b>Gunite</b> was copyrighted in 1912 and continued as a proprietary trademark until 1967, when it became a generic term. The process involves a mixture of sand and cement which is loaded into one chamber, a stream of the dry mixture is forced along a delivery pipe to the gun, and on discharge is mixed with an annular jet of water. It was only in the 1920s that the process spread internationally, {{and it is difficult to}} ascertain whether other examples of bridges using the <b>Gunite</b> process, beside the St Paul Minnesota bridge, exist.
