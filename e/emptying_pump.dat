40|$|In the oil {{production}} process, some oil pumps {{exist in the}} light load running and <b>empty</b> <b>pumping</b> problems, which result in the waste of electric energy. In order to realize the oil pumping energy saving optimal control by adopting oil pumping start-stop intermittent control scheme, an intelligent energy saving optimal control system based on genetic algorithm and wavelet neural network is proposed in this paper. The Morlet wavelet is adopted as the activation function of neural network and builds the wavelet neural networkandthe structure and parameters of the wavelet neural network which are chromosome encoded, and the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the connection weights and the scale parameters {{in order to improve}} the generalization ability and the approximation ability of neural networks. The parameters of effective oil pumping energy saving optimal control are measured using multisensors. The system is used in the {{oil production}} plant; the test data show that the oil pumping energy conservation effect is obvious...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{assessed}} {{whether the}} end-systolic pressure-volume relationship obtained without any interventions during pulsatile left ventricular bypass adequately represents native heart function. In 11 anesthetized Holstein calves, left ventricular pressure {{was measured with}} a micromanometer while left ventricular volume was simultaneously calculated from orthogonal left ventricular diameters measured with ultrasonic dimension transducers. End-systolic pressure and volume data were subjected to linear regression analysis to achieve an end-systolic pressure-volume relationship. Data from both caval occlusions and aortic occlusion {{were used for the}} control end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (median r = 0. 941, slope = 7. 4 ± 0. 8 mm Hg per milliliter per 100 gm left ventricular weight; mean ± standard error of the mean). During left atrial-aortic bypass with a Pierce-Donachy pneumatic assist pump in the asynchronous mode, the end-systolic pressure-volume relationships were obtained without interventions to change ventricular loading conditions. During maximal ventricular unloading during full to <b>empty</b> <b>pumping,</b> termed 100 %, the resulting narrow range of pressure and volume data did not yield highly linear end-systolic pressure-volume relationships (median r = 0. 669, slope = 4. 9 ± 0. 9 mm Hg per milliliter per 100 gm left ventricular weight). However, at reduced rates off pumping, the end-systolic pressure-volume relationships were considerably linear (80 %, median r = 0. 819; 60 %, median r = 0. 868; 40 %, median r = 0. 899). Slopes did not significantly differ from control values (80 %, 6. 9 ± 1. 1; 60 %, 8. 2 ± 1. 1; 40 %, 7. 8 ± 1. 1). The end-systolic pressure-volume relationship obtained without exogenous load changes during asynchronous, pulsatile left ventricular bypass represents native left ventricular systolic function.

25|$|While {{the concept}} has been {{suggested}} {{in a number of}} cases, the only example in the world of a drop lock that has actually been constructed is at Dalmuir on the Forth and Clyde Canal in Scotland. This lock, of the single chamber type, was incorporated during the restoration of the canal, to allow the replacement of a swing bridge (on a busy A road) by a fixed bridge, and so answer criticisms that the restoration of the canal would cause frequent interruptions of the heavy road traffic. It can be <b>emptied</b> by <b>pumping</b> – but as this uses a lot of electricity the method used when water supplies are adequate is to drain the lock to a nearby burn. A series of pictures showing the operation of the lock can be seen here.|$|R

50|$|When practical, a sump {{can also}} be drained using buckets, pumps or siphons. Pumping the water away {{requires}} the inward flow of water into the sump {{to be less than}} {{the rate at which the}} <b>pump</b> <b>empties</b> it, as well as a suitable place to collect the emptied water. Upstream sumps have been successfully emptied using hoses to siphon water out of them, such as at the Sinkhole Dersios during exploration in 2005. The water was sent deeper into the sinkhole and the emptied sumps revealed virgin passage behind them. During a rescue from beyond a downstream sump at Sarkhos Cave in 2002, water was pumped upstream into a dam constructed a few metres above the flooded passage.|$|R
40|$|Safe {{emptying}} {{and disposal}} of fecal sludge from pit latrines in rural areas has become a priority for the Government of Bangladesh. In this paper, we calculate the volume and characterize the hazards of managing sludge to identify technologies for safely emptying rural single pits. In Bhaluka subdistrict, an estimated 15, 000 m 3 of sludge is produced annually. Physical, chemical, and microbial analysis of samples of sludge taken from pit latrines indicate that the sludge has a high moisture content of around 90 %, a C:N ration of 10 : 1, and a helminth presence of 41 eggs/g. In a field test of alternative <b>emptying</b> technologies, simple <b>pumps</b> such as the gulper emerged as feasible for use in rural areas, due to the liquid nature of the sludge, narrow roads, and limited incomes of rural households. The results suggest that current practices of emptying liquid sludge manually without any protective equipment poses risks to those who handle sludge, and the process needs to be semi-mechanized with immediate effect. These results are {{being used by the}} Bangladesh government to design policy for sludge management. In the near future, an organized service that safely empties single pits and transports sludge for treatment needs to be urgently designed...|$|R
50|$|Rocket engines {{requires}} {{a tremendous amount}} of fuelat high pressure. Often the pump costs more than the thrust chamber. One way to supply fuel is to use the expensiveturbopump mentioned above, another way is to pressurize fueltank. Pressurizing a large fuel tank {{requires a}} heavy, expensive tank. However suppose instead of pressurizing the entire tank, the main tank is drained into a small pump chamber which is thenpressurized. To achieve steady flow, the pump system consists oftwo pump chambers such that each one supplies fuel for half of each cycle. The pump is powered by pressurized gas which acts directly on the fluid. For each half of the pump system, a chamber is filled from the main tank under low pressure and at a high flow rate, then the chamber is pressurized, and then the fluid is delivered to the engine at a moderate flow rate under high pressure. The chamber is then vented and cycle repeats. The system is designed so that the inlet flow rate is higher than the outlet flow rate. This allows time for one chamber to be vented, refilled and pressurized while the other is being <b>emptied.</b> A breadboard <b>pump</b> has been tested and it works great. A high version has been designed and built and is pumping at 20 gpm and 550 psi.|$|R
40|$|Left atrial (LA) {{function}} {{plays an}} important role in the maintenance of cardiac output, however, in patients with constrictive pericarditis (CP), whether pericardial restriction and adhesion can lead to LA dysfunction, and the characteristics of LA function remain unclear. The aim of the study is to compare the left atrial (LA) function of patients with CP to that of healthy study participants using speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) and conventional echocardiography. Thirty patients with CP and 30 healthy volunteers (controls) were enrolled in the study. The underlying cause of CP was viral pericarditis in 24 (80 %) patients and unknown in 6 (20 %) patients. The LA maximum volume (Vmax), LA minimal volume (Vmin), and LA volume before atrial contraction (Vpre-a) were measured using biplane modified Simpson's method. The LA expansion index (LA reservoir function) was determined as follows: ([LAVmax - LAVmin]/LAVmin) × 100. The passive emptying index (LA conduit function) was calculated as follows: ([LAVmax - LAVpre-a]/LAVmax) × 100, and the active <b>emptying</b> index (booster <b>pump</b> function) was calculated as follows: ([LAVpre-a - LAVmin]/LAVpre-a) × 100. All the patients underwent two-dimensional STE. The LA global systolic strain (S), systolic strain rate (SrS), early diastolic strain rate (SrE) and late diastolic strain rate (SrA) were measured. The LA expansion index, passive emptying index, the active emptying index and the LA global S, SrS, SrE, SrA were found to be significantly lower in patients with CP than in the control participants (P < 0. 001). LA function was correlated with the early diastolic velocity of the lateral mitral annulus (P < 0. 05). Although left ventricular systolic function was preserved in patients with CP, the LA reservoir, conduit, and booster functions were impaired. Pericardial restriction and impairment of the LA myocardium may play an important role in the reduction of LA function in patients with CP...|$|R
50|$|In May 1938 a {{shortage}} of water occurred in Munkkiniemi. Water consumption had been about 90 litres per inhabitant per day during all of the 1930s and the water supply {{was thought to be}} enough for new inhabitants. In 1937 1 500 new rooms had been built and the speed of construction was considerable. During two fires in May that much water had been used that the reserve supplies <b>emptied.</b> When the <b>pumps</b> were reconnected the nervous inhabitants filled buckets and tubs with water which led to that the water supplies emptied again. The consumption was suddenly 150 litres per person per day and the supplies never had time to recover. M.G. Stenius applied to build a water pipe from Helsinki and buy the city’s water. Helsinki already sold water to other nearby municipalities like Oulunkylä. The City of Helsinki was at the same time negotiating to buy the company and refused to give permission to build a water pipe, because this gave them a great bargaining position. After a dry summer and unsuccessful attempts to find more water sources a building ban was issued in Munkkiniemi in October 1938. Tenants refused to pay rents and a witch-hunt against the company and the municipality was pursued. Water consumption had reached 250 litres per person per day in the autumn and the company blamed the inhabitants for wasting water and even sabotage. In November the owners of M.G. Stenius gave up and sold their stocks to the City of Helsinki that gained large areas of land in Munkkiniemi, Haaga, Leppävaara and Laajalahti. Already two weeks after the purchase of M.G. Stenius the city began building a water pipe to Munkkiniemi and in January 1939 the people of Munkkniemi were drinking Helsinki water.|$|R
50|$|River rapids rides feature {{circular}} rafts {{with two}} main components: the fiberglass {{body in which}} passengers are seated and the rubber ring upon which the body is secured. The rubber ring provides buoyancy as well as shock absorption for when rafts collide with an obstacle {{during the course of}} the ride or with each other. Most rafts hold between six and twelve passengers, seated in groups of two or three depending on the manufacturer of the ride. Riders face toward center of the boat and are usually secured by a lap belt. Some rafts feature a circular metal bar in the middle of the raft; this gives passengers a place to grip or brace their feet. Some parks include a space for stowing small items in the center. The floor of the raft body is generally above water level to allow drainage. Most parks require riders to be 36 inches or taller.Generally, the station starts at the highest point on the ride, with the river channel having a slight gradient to it for the remainder of the ride. A lift hill then brings the boats back up to station level at the end of the ride. This is usually also the point where the ride's main pumps are housed, bringing the water up from the low point and back up to the high point. The gradient on the river channel provides the water with its flow and pace. This also has the interesting side effect such that when the ride's pumps are switched off at the end of operation or in an emergency, the water naturally flows back to the end of the ride where it collects, leaving the majority of the ride's river channel empty and drained until the pumps are turned back on. All Intamin permanent (and most other) river rapids rides feature a connected lake of some sort at the end of the ride before the lift hill. This is sometimes used to store broken boats. Its main purpose, however, is to help store the large amounts of water that collect at the end of the ride (before the lift hill) once the ride's main pumps are turned off. This is the water that would have been circulating around the ride when it is in operation. When observed, you can usually see the height difference in the water level in this lake from when the rides pumps are turned on, to when they are turned off. This effect is usually less noticeable if an already existing larger lake is used for the ride's water storage. Generally, a longer rapids ride will need a larger lake, as there will be more water to store once the ride's pumps have been turned off. Depending on the size and length of the river rapids ride, it can take up to 15 minutes to fill the ride's channel up from <b>empty</b> once the <b>pumps</b> have been switched on.|$|R
