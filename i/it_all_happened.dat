25|$|The Riverworld series {{originated}} in a novel, Owe for the Flesh, written {{in one month}} in 1952 as a contest entry. It won the contest, but the book was left unpublished and orphaned when the prize money was misappropriated, and Farmer nearly gave up writing altogether. The original manuscript of the novel was lost, but years later Farmer reworked the material into the Riverworld magazine stories mentioned above. Eventually, {{a copy of a}} revised version of the original novel surfaced in a box in a garage and was published as River of Eternity by Phantasia Press in 1983. Farmer's Introduction to this edition gives the details of how <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>happened.</b>|$|E

500|$|Miller {{first heard}} about the {{clearing}} of the Les Innocents cemetery ten years before writing the novel, when reading a book by French medievalist and historian, Philippe Ariès; specifically his 1977 work entitled L'Homme devant la mort, or The Hour of Our Death. Ariès' book did not go into {{a great deal of}} detail concerning this actual event, however Miller was [...] "taken by the theatricality" [...] of it and decided to write a novel based around the exhumation. In an interview with Kira Cochrane he stated the novel [...] "appealed to [...] as being interesting, visually interesting", stating [...] "it was when <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>happened</b> that made it stand out. It's the 1780s, a few years before the French revolution". Miller further stated that his father's occupation as a doctor also had some bearing in his interest in the human body, stating [...] "I grew up looking at these things – my Beano and Dandy were the BMJ and The Lancet". Miller decided not to include any French dialogue in the novel as [...] "it is so pretentious" [...] in an English-language novel, stating [...] "I was afraid that my editor would strike it out".|$|E
500|$|Wolfgang Flür {{has stated}} Kraftwerk were {{influenced}} by {{the music of the}} Weimar Germany era: [...] "we were children who were born straight after World War Two ... we had no musical or pop culture of our own ... there was the war, and before the war we had only the German folk music. In the 1920s or 1930s melodies were developed and these became culture that we worked from". Karl Bartos also spoke of post-war influence as the group thought that they [...] "had this development in the 1920s which was very, very strong and was audio visual. We had the Bauhaus school before the war and then after the war we had tremendous people like Karlheinz Stockhausen and the development of the classical and the electronic classical. This was very strong and <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>happened</b> very close to Düsseldorf in Cologne and all the great composers at that time came there." [...] Paul Alessandrini is credited for helping contribute to the album's concept. Alessandrini told Hütter and Schneider that [...] "with the kind of music you do, which is kind of like an electronic blues, railway stations and trains are very important in your universe, you should do a song about the Trans Europe Express". Kraftwerk believed critics in the United Kingdom and the United States associated them with Nazi Germany, with tracks such as [...] "Autobahn" [...] inextricably linked with the Nazis who built the high-speed roads in the 1930s and 1940s. At the same time, the band were keen to move away from their German heritage towards a new sense of European identity and felt that the Trans Europ Express could be used to symbolize this. Allmusic referred to Trans-Europe Express as a concept album with two different themes. The first being the disparities between reality and image, represented by the songs [...] "Hall of Mirrors" [...] and [...] "Showroom Dummies", and the others about the glorification of Europe. Slant Magazine described the album as [...] "a sonic poem to Europe".|$|E

2500|$|In 1934, Olympic again {{struck a}} ship. The {{approaches}} to New York {{were marked by}} lightships and Olympic, like other liners, had been known to pass close by these vessels. On 15 May 1934, Olympic, inbound in heavy fog, was homing in on the radio beacon of Nantucket Lightship LV-117. Now {{under the command of}} Captain John Binks, the ship failed to turn in time and sliced through the smaller vessel, which broke apart and sank. Four of the lightship's crew went down with the vessel and seven were rescued, of whom three died of their injuries – thus there were seven fatalities out of a crew of eleven. The lightship's surviving crew and Olympics captain were interviewed soon after reaching shore. [...] One crewman said <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>happened</b> so quickly that they didn't know how it happened. [...] The captain was very sorry it happened but said Olympic reacted very quickly lowering boats to rescue the crew, which was confirmed by an injured crewman.|$|E
2500|$|Portman was {{a unique}} choice because she was {{unfamiliar}} with Star Wars.

[...] She told a CNN interviewer, [...] "I really wasn't aware of how big a deal Star Wars was ... and when I saw the films, I really liked them, but I still didn't really understand how many ... were passionate fans of this film." [...] Portman was, however, enthusiastic over being cast as the queen of Naboo, a character she expected to become a role model: [...] "It was wonderful playing a young queen with so much power. I {{think it will be}} good for young women to see a strong woman of action who is also smart and a leader." ...|$|E

2500|$|Taking {{their name}} from the David Bowie song with the same title, Pritchard {{revealed}} the first song they ever played as a group was a cover version of The Strokes' song [...] "Reptilia". The Kooks recorded an EP demo, sending it out in search of gigs; they instead received offers from managers and record companies. The band had only been together as a group for four months when they signed with Virgin Records, after being spotted by several label scouts at the Brighton Free Butt Festival in 2005. In an interview with musicOMH, Pritchard revealed [...] "It was really quick how <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>happened,</b> we did a demo with a mate of ours in London, which we sent off to one guy to get some gigs, and {{he turned out to}} be a manager. He rung us up and it kind of went from there." [...] The members of the band have since revealed that they felt they weren’t ready at the time, [...] "We were way too early to sign a record deal ... We were really young, we'd been together like two or three months, so we really didn't want to sign. But then we thought it's a really good opportunity and Virgin seemed like really cool people - they just seemed to really understand where we were coming from.," [...] said Pritchard, who has also complimented the space the record label allowed for the band to grow, [...] "They were patient with us and let us develop our style, whatever it was." ...|$|E
