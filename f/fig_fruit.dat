40|$|<b>Fig</b> <b>fruits</b> were {{subjected}} to osmotic dehydration by means of five different sugar syrups, in order to check the aptitude of the species {{to this kind of}} processing. Osmotic dehydration was carried out at 25 °C and at atmospheric pressure on whole <b>fig</b> <b>fruits</b> of the local cultivar Verde. Processing lasted 24 h and the following dehydrating syrups were used: sucrose, glucose, fructose and two commercial hydrolysed corn starch syrups, Frudex 70 and Glicosa. At fixed intervals (0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h) appropriate determinations were done on fruit pulp, in order to calculate weight loss, water loss, solid gain and normalised solid content. Results obtained with no doubt indicate that whole <b>fig</b> <b>fruits</b> show a low aptitude to be osmo-dehydrated, probably for their morphology and anatomy and for processing conditions used in this trial...|$|R

5000|$|The syconium {{often has}} a bulbous shape {{with a small}} opening (the ostiole) at the outward end that allows access to pollinators. The flowers are pollinated by very small wasps that crawl through the opening {{in search of a}} {{suitable}} place to lay eggs. Without this pollinator service fig trees could not reproduce by seed. In turn, the flowers provide a safe haven and nourishment {{for the next generation of}} wasps. This accounts for the frequent presence of wasp larvae in the fruit, and has led to a coevolutionary relationship. Technically, a <b>fig</b> <b>fruit</b> proper would be only one of the many tiny matured, seed-bearing gynoecia found inside one fig - if you cut open a fresh fig, individual fruit will appear as fleshy [...] "threads", each bearing a single seed inside. The genus Dorstenia, also in the fig family (Moraceae), exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface.|$|E
50|$|Ficus carica is a gynodioecious (functionally dioecious), {{deciduous}} tree {{or large}} shrub, growing to {{a height of}} 7 - 10 m, with smooth white bark. Its fragrant leaves are 12 - 25 cm long and 10 - 18 cm across, and deeply lobed with three or five lobes. The complex inflorescence consists of a hollow fleshy structure called the syconium, which is lined with numerous unisexual flowers. The flowers themselves are not visible from outside the syconium, as they bloom inside the infructescence. Although {{commonly referred to as}} a fruit, the fig is actually the infructescence or scion of the tree, known as a false fruit or multiple fruit, in which the flowers and seeds are borne. It is a hollow-ended stem containing many flowers. The small orifice (ostiole) visible on the middle of the fruit is a narrow passage, which allows the specialized fig wasp Blastophaga psenes to enter the fruit and pollinate the flower, whereafter the fruit grows seeds.

5000|$|The {{specific}} {{identification of}} many of the species can be difficult, but figs as a group are relatively easy to recognize. Many have aerial roots and a distinctive shape or habit, and their fruits distinguish them from other plants. The <b>fig</b> <b>fruit</b> is an enclosed inflorescence, sometimes referred to as a syconium, an urn-like structure lined on the inside with the fig's tiny flowers. The unique fig pollination system, involving tiny, highly specific wasps, known as fig wasps that enter via ostiole these sub-closed inflorescences to both pollinate and lay their own eggs, has been a constant source of inspiration and wonder to biologists. Finally, there are three vegetative traits that together are unique to figs. All figs possess a white to yellowish latex, some in copious quantities; the twig has paired stipules or a circular stipule scar if the stipules have fallen off; and the lateral veins {{at the base of the}} leaf are steep, forming a tighter angle with the midrib than the other lateral veins, a feature referred to as [...] "tri-veined".|$|E
5000|$|Fig {{trees have}} profoundly {{influenced}} culture through several religious traditions. Among the more famous species are the sacred fig tree (Pipal, bodhi, bo, or po, Ficus religiosa) and the banyan fig (Ficus benghalensis). The oldest living plant of known planting date is a Ficus religiosa tree {{known as the}} Sri Maha Bodhi planted in the temple at Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka by King Tissa in 288 BCE. The common fig {{is one of two}} significant trees in Islam, and there is a sura in Quran named [...] "The Fig" [...] or At-Tin (سوره تین). In East Asia, figs are important in Buddhism and Hinduism. In Jainism, the consumption of any fruit belonging to this genus is prohibited. The Buddha is traditionally held to have found bodhi (enlightenment) while meditating under a sacred fig (F. religiosa). The same species was Ashvattha, the [...] "world tree" [...] of Hinduism. The plaksa Pra-sravana was said to be a fig tree between the roots of which the Sarasvati River sprang forth; it is usually held to be a sacred fig but more probably seems to be a wavy-leaved fig (F. infectoria). According to the Kikuyu people, sacrifices to Ngai were performed under a sycomore tree (Mũkũyũ) and if one was not available, a fig tree (Mũgumo) would be used. The common fig tree is cited in the Bible, where in Genesis 3:7, Adam and Eve cover their nakedness with fig leaves. The <b>fig</b> <b>fruit</b> is also included in the list of food found in the Promised Land, according to the Torah (Deut. 8). Jesus cursed a fig tree for bearing no fruit (...) [...] The fig tree was sacred in ancient Cyprus where it was a symbol of fertility.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the levels}} of {{endogenous}} free-, bound- and total-zeatin (Z) has been examined in <b>fig</b> <b>fruit</b> (Ficus carica L. cv. Bursa Siyahı). The fruit harvested at different developmental stages were analysed for endogenous zeatin content. The index of maturity was stage 1 (green, small), stage 2 (green, big) and stage 3 (dark brown, harvest maturity). This work describes the identification of endogenous cytokinins through HPLC methodology in developing fig fruits. At {{the end of the}} research, it has been showed that endogenous zeatin plant hormones, which has been synthesised, were both free and bound forms. Concentration of free, bound and total Z during the growing stages varied between 536 - 1707 ng. g- 1, 661 - 1932 ng. g- 1 and 1208 - 2797 ng. g- 1, respectively. High concentrations of endogenous Z have been found in early stages of <b>fig</b> <b>fruit</b> (1). The large accumulation of endogenous Z in the first growth stage may have an important function in setting the development pattern of the “Bursa Siyahı ” <b>fig</b> <b>fruit...</b>|$|E

40|$|The dimorphisms in {{morphology}} {{and behaviour}} of male fig wasps {{are among the}} most extreme in the animal kingdom, and offer excellent opportunities to test the predictions of certain sexual selection models. Winged males resemble their conspecific females closely, but wingless males are so divergent in form that they have repeatedly been classified into different taxa. Wingless males mate within their natal <b>fig</b> <b>fruits,</b> whereas winged males disperse to mate. Individual species may have winged males, wingless males or both morphs. A key hypothesis proposes that sexual selection on male mating opportunities favours winged males in species with small broods and wingless males in species with large broods. Using data from 114 species in 33 genera, we show that both simple and formal comparative analyses support the correlated evolution of large brood size and male winglessness. Theoretical models further predict that, in male dimorphic species, the proportion of winged males should equal (in cases without local mate competition) or exceed (in cases with local mate competition) the proportion of females developing in <b>fig</b> <b>fruits</b> without wingless males. These predictions are met by eight out of nine male dimorphic species studied. Taken together, the patterns across all species, and between different male dimorphic species, strongly support sexual selection on mating opportunities as the major determinant of male morph ratios in fig wasps...|$|R

40|$|Figs {{and their}} pollinating wasps are a {{textbook}} case of mutualism {{in which each}} fig species depends on its host-specific wasp species for pollination services and, in turn, the wasp larvae develop within {{a subset of the}} fig’s seeds. In addition, the fig-pollinator mutualism is parasitized by a diversity of non-pollinating fig wasps that compete with pollinators by also galling and developing within fig seeds. Given than many co-occurring fig wasp species utilize precisely the same resource – fig seeds – the ecological theory of competitive exclusion predicts that they should not stably coexist over time. To investigate how they do in fact coexist, we asked if wasp species minimize inter-specific competition by utilizing spatially segregated subsets of seeds within <b>fig</b> <b>fruit.</b> Focusing on 5 co-occurring, seed-galling wasps associated with the Sonoran Desert rock fig, Ficus petiolaris, we dissected seeds from nearly mature <b>fig</b> <b>fruit</b> and tested whether the different wasps differentially develop with seeds located more deeply or shallowly within <b>fig</b> <b>fruit.</b> Our results indicate significant differences between wasp species with respect to depth of seeds they utilize, which promotes coexistence. Further, consistent with theory, we show that species utilizing different seeds experience reduced inter-specific competition...|$|E
40|$|Ficus carica L. (the {{common fig}} tree) {{is one of}} many {{non-native}} species adapted to homegarden systems within northern Mexico and southern Arizona. Along with other Mediterranean fruits such as grapes and olives, fig trees were introduced to the area through the Catholic mission system during the mid- 1500 s to the mid- 1800 s. Clonal descendents from the original ‘Mission ’ fig trees persist in present-day homegardens. The objective {{of this study is to}} provide information critical for the conservation of heirloom ‘Mission ’ fig trees in Southern Arizona homegardens. One step in this process is the evaluation of the nutrients of heirloom fig fruits. The results from a preliminary nutrient study are presented in this paper. The results show that for fresh and dried heirloom <b>fig</b> <b>fruit,</b> sugar levels and vitamin A levels are statistically lower when compared to the U. S.
