25|$|In other jurisdictions, the <b>disseisor</b> acquires {{merely an}} {{equitable}} title; the landowner {{is considered to}} be a trustee of the property for the <b>disseisor.</b>|$|E
25|$|The party seeking title by adverse {{possession}} {{may be called}} the <b>disseisor,</b> meaning one who dispossesses the true owner of the property. Although the elements of an {{adverse possession}} claim are different in each state, adverse possession requires at a minimum five basic conditions being met to perfect {{the title of the}} <b>disseisor.</b> These are that the <b>disseisor</b> must openly occupy the property exclusively, {{in a manner that is}} open and notorious, keep out others, and use it as if it were his own. Some states impose additional requirements.|$|E
25|$|The {{statute of}} {{limitations}} applies only to the disseisor's time on the property, not how long the true owner may have been dispossessed of it (by, say, another <b>disseisor</b> who then left the property). However, if adverse possession is continuous between two or more successive disseisors without interruption, {{it may be possible}} for the second <b>disseisor</b> to claim adverse possession for the entire period based upon a legal doctrine known as tacking.|$|E
50|$|Open and notorious {{use of the}} {{property}} - The <b>disseisor's</b> use of {{the property}} must be so visible and apparent that it gives notice to the legal owner that someone may assert claim, and must be of such character that would give notice to a reasonable person. If legal owner has actual knowledge, this element is met; it can be also met by fencing, opening or closing gates or an entry to the property, posted signs, crops, buildings, or animals that a diligent owner {{could be expected to}} know about.|$|R
25|$|The <b>disseisor</b> {{claiming}} {{adverse possession}} must hold that property continuously {{for the entire}} statute of limitations period, {{and use it as}} a true owner would for that time.|$|E
25|$|Generally, the disseisor's openly hostile {{possession}} must be continual (although not necessarily constant) without challenge or {{permission from the}} lawful owner, but breaks in use {{that are consistent with}} how an owner would use the property will not prevent an adverse possession claim. Occasional activity on the land with long gaps in activity fail the test of continuous possession; courts have ruled that merely cutting timber at intervals, when not accompanied by other actions that demonstrate actual and continuous possession, fails to demonstrate continuous possession. If {{at any time during the}} statute of limitations period, the true owner ejects the <b>disseisor</b> from the land either verbally or through legal action, and the <b>disseisor</b> then returns and dispossesses him again, then the statute of limitations period begins anew.|$|E
25|$|Dispossession of land {{owned by}} a {{governmental}} entity: Generally, a <b>disseisor</b> cannot dispossess land legally {{owned by a}} government entity even if all other elements of adverse possession are met. One exception is when the government entity is acting like a business rather than a government entity.|$|E
25|$|A <b>disseisor</b> will be {{committing}} a civil trespass {{on the property}} he has taken {{and the owner of}} the property could cause him to be evicted by an action in trespass ("ejectment") or by bringing an action for possession. All common law jurisdictions require that an ejectment action be brought within a specified time, after which the true owner is assumed to have acquiesced. The effect of a failure by the true landowner to evict the adverse possessor depends on the jurisdiction, but will eventually result in title by adverse possession.|$|E
2500|$|Adverse {{possession}} extends only to {{the property}} actually possessed. If the original owner had a title to a greater area (or volume) of property, the <b>disseisor</b> does not obtain all of it. The exception to this is when the <b>disseisor</b> enters the land under a color of title to an entire parcel, his continuous and actual possession of {{a small part of}} that parcel will perfect his title to the entire parcel defined in his color of title. [...] Thus a <b>disseisor</b> need not build a dwelling on, or farm on, every portion of a large tract in order to prove possession, as long as his title does correctly describe the entire parcel.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>disseisor</b> {{must have}} entered or used the land without {{permission}} from the true owner. The disseisor's motivations may be interpreted by the court in several ways, depending upon state law and precedent: ...|$|E
2500|$|Payment of {{property}} taxes. [...] This {{may be required}} by statute, such as in California, or just a contributing element to a court's determination of possession. Both payment by the <b>disseisor</b> and by the true owner are relevant.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>disseisor</b> must {{physically}} use {{the land}} as a property owner would, {{in accordance with the}} type of property, location, and uses (merely walking or hunting on land does not establish actual possession). [...] The actions of the <b>disseisor</b> must change the state of the land (in the case of non-residential property, taking such actions as clearing, mowing, planting, harvesting fruit of the land, logging or cutting timber, mining, fencing, pulling tree stumps, running livestock and constructing buildings or other improvements) or, if the property is residential, maintaining the property for its intended use (taking such actions as mowing the yard, trimming trees and hedges, changing locks, repairing or replacing fixtures such as a swimming pool, sprinkler system, or appliances), all to the exclusion of its true owner.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{the concept}} of squatter's rights,mnb {{generally}} {{used to refer to}} a specific form of adverse possession where the <b>disseisor</b> holds no title to any properties adjoining the property under dispute. [...] In most jurisdictions of the United States, few squatters can meet the legal requirements for adverse possession.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>disseisor</b> {{holds the}} land to the {{exclusion}} of the true owner. There may be more than one adverse possessor, taking as tenants in common, so long as the other elements are met. [...] But adverse possession cannot be successfully claimed if, any time during the statutory period, the true owner uses the land for any reason.|$|E
2500|$|Under this theory, adverse {{possession}} grants only those {{rights in the}} disseized property that are 'taken' by the <b>disseisor.</b> For example, a <b>disseisor</b> might choose to take an easement rather than the entire fee title to the property. In this manner, {{it is possible to}} disseize an easement, under the legal doctrine of prescription. This must also be done openly but need not be exclusive. Prescription is governed by different statutory and common law time limits to {{adverse possession}}. It is common practice in cities such as New York, where builders often leave sidewalk space or plazas in front of their buildings to meet zoning requirements, to close public areas they own periodically to prevent the creation of a permanent easement that would cloud their exclusive property rights. [...] For the same reason, city sidewalks may have embedded markers along the property line around a plaza or open area announcing [...] "This Space Not Dedicated" [...] to indicate that although the public may use the space within the markers, it is still private property.|$|E
2500|$|Adverse {{possession}} is in {{some ways}} similar to homesteading. [...] Like the <b>disseisor,</b> the homesteader may gain title to property by using the land and fulfilling certain other conditions. In homesteading, however, the possession of the property is not hostile; the land is either considered to have no legal owner or is owned by the government. The government allows the homesteader to use the land with the expectation that the homesteader who fulfills the requirements necessary for the homestead will gain title to the property.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>disseisor</b> must {{possess the}} {{property}} {{in a manner that}} is capable of being seen. That is, the disseisor's use of the property must be sufficiently visible and apparent that it gives notice to the legal owner that someone may assert claim, and must be of such character that would give notice to a reasonable person. [...] If legal owner has actual knowledge of the use, this element is met; it can be also met by fencing, opening or closing gates or an entry to the property, posted signs, crops, buildings, or animals that a diligent owner could be expected to know about.|$|E
2500|$|Color of title, {{claim of}} title, or claim of right. Color of title and claim of title involve a legal {{document}} that appears (incorrectly) {{to give the}} <b>disseisor</b> title. In some jurisdictions the mere intent to take the land as one's own may constitute [...] "claim of right", with no documentation required. [...] Other cases have determined that a claim of right exists if the person believes he has rightful claim to the property, even if that belief is mistaken. A negative example would be a timber thief who sneaks onto a property, cuts timber not visible from the road, and hauls the logs away at night. His actions, though they demonstrate actual possession, also demonstrate knowledge of guilt, as opposed to claim of right.|$|E
50|$|In other jurisdictions, the <b>disseisor</b> acquires {{merely an}} {{equitable}} title; the landowner {{is considered to}} be a trustee of the property for the <b>disseisor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Continuous {{use of the}} {{property}} - The <b>disseisor</b> claiming adverse possession must hold that property continuously for the entire statute of limitations period, {{and use it as}} a true owner would for that time. The statute applies only to the disseisor's time on {{the property}}, not how long the true owner may have been dispossessed of it (by, say, another <b>disseisor</b> who then left the property).

5000|$|A <b>disseisor</b> is {{the person}} who has taken adverse {{possession}} of real property from the legal owner; ie., who has taken actual possession or occupation of the property without the permission of the legal owner. In property law, the <b>disseisor</b> deprives the legal owner of possession or seisin of an estate in land, thus [...] "dis-seizing" [...] (dispossessing) the legal owner.|$|E
5000|$|The {{adverse party}} {{is called the}} <b>disseisor,</b> meaning one who dispossesses the true owner of the {{property}}. The <b>disseisor</b> must openly occupy the property exclusively, keep out others, {{and use it as}} if it were his own. Some jurisdictions permit accidental adverse possession as might occur with a surveying error. Generally, the openly hostile possession must be continual (although not necessarily continuous or constant) without challenge or permission from the lawful owner, for a fixed statutory period to acquire title. Where the property is of a type ordinarily occupied only during certain times (such as a summer cottage), the <b>disseisor</b> may need to have only exclusive, open, and hostile possession during those successive useful periods, making the same use of the property as an owner would for the required number of years. Adverse possession requires at a minimum five basic conditions being met to perfect the title of the <b>disseisor.</b> These are: ...|$|E

5000|$|Non-permissive, hostile or {{adverse use}} of the {{property}} - The <b>disseisor</b> entered or used the land without permission from the true owner.

50|$|Exclusive {{use of the}} {{property}} - The <b>disseisor</b> holds the land {{to the exclusion of}} the true owner. There may be more than one adverse possessor, taking as tenants in common, so long as the other elements are met. But if any time the true owner uses the land for any reason, adverse possession cannot be claimed.|$|E
50|$|Actual {{possession}} of the property - The <b>disseisor</b> must physically use the land as a property owner would, {{in accordance with the}} type of property, location, and uses (merely walking or hunting on land does not establish actual possession). In Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that Cone failed to establish actual possession by occasionally visiting the land and hunting on it, because his actions did not change the land from a wild and natural state. The actions of the <b>disseisor</b> must change the state of the land (in the case of non-residential property, taking such actions as clearing, mowing, planting, harvesting fruit of the land, logging or cutting timber, mining, fencing, pulling tree stumps, running livestock and constructing buildings or other improvements) or, if the property is residential, maintaining the property for its intended use (taking such actions as mowing the yard, trimming trees and hedges, changing locks, repairing or replacing fixtures such as a swimming pool, sprinkler system, or appliances), all to the exclusion of its true owner.|$|E

50|$|The {{circumstances}} in which adverse possession arises determine the type of title acquired by the <b>disseisor,</b> which may be fee simple title, mineral rights, or another interest in real property. Adverse possession's origins are based both in statutory actions and in common law precepts, so the details concerning adverse possession actions vary by jurisdiction. The required period of uninterrupted possession is governed by the statute of limitations. Other elements of adverse possession are judicial constructs.|$|E

50|$|Adverse {{possession}} is {{a situation}} when a person {{who does not have}} legal title to land (or real property) occupies the land without the permission of the legal owner. The permission of the owner may be reflected in the entering into a lease or granting a licence, typically associated with the payment of some rent. The laws of many countries allow the adverse possessor (in law also called the <b>disseisor)</b> to acquire title to the land after a prescribed statutory period, which varies between jurisdictions, and depends on the type of land and other circumstances. The laws of most jurisdictions do not permit claims of adverse possession against public land. Squatting is a form of adverse possession. The adverse possessor is usually required to prove non-permissive use which is actual, open and notorious, exclusive, adverse, and continuous for the statutory period. If a claim to title by adverse possession is successful, title is acquired without compensation.|$|E
40|$|Recoupment. Under the {{doctrine}} of compensatio, known to the Roman Law, mutual debts could be set off against each other. At early common law, however, it seems that mutual cancellation of debts could only be had through an agreement between the parties [...] implied by the striking of an account, or expressed {{in the making of}} a compromise. By the time of Henry VIII, however, a defendant was allowed to introduce new matter which would tend to defeat or diminish the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s recovery. This was known as recoupment. At first it was limited to a showing of payment, or of former recovery. Later, recoupment was developed so as to allow a defendant to show, for the purpose of reducing the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s recovery, any facts, arising out of the transaction sued upon or connected with the subject thereof, which facts might have founded an independent action in favor of the defendant against the plaintiff. Thus, in an action for work and labor, the defendant might prove that the work was improperly done; and, in an action for goods sold and delivered, damages could be recouped because of a breach of warranty. Similarly, rent accruing during disseisin could be recouped by a <b>disseisor,</b> and in an action upon one clause of a contract, recoupment has been allowed for a breach by the plaintiff of another clause of the same contract. It was not necessary that the opposing claims be liquidated, nor that they be of the same character, i. e., a claim in 2 ̆ 2 tort 2 ̆ 2 could be set off against one in 2 ̆ 2 contract. 2 ̆ 2 It was essential, however, that the claims of both plaintiff and defendant involve the same 2 ̆ 2 subject matter, 2 ̆ 2 or arise out of the 2 ̆ 2 same transaction, 2 ̆ 2 andthat they be susceptible of adjustment in the same action...|$|E
