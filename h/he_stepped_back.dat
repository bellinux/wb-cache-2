5|$|For Mint Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro, the {{opportunity}} to put Eisenhower on a coin was the fulfillment of a longtime dream. On June 19, 1945, Gasparro {{had been one of}} more than 4 million people who gathered in New York to watch a parade celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. Although Gasparro, then an assistant engraver at the Mint, only saw a glimpse of General Eisenhower, <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> from the crowd and drew the general's features. That sketch served as the basis of his design for the obverse. Gasparro consulted with the late president's widow, Mamie Eisenhower, as to the designs of both sides of the coin; the former First Lady was presented with a galvano (a metallic model used in the coin design process) by Brooks and Gasparro on January 1, 1971. Gasparro wrote in 1991 that he had six weeks to complete the work beginning in mid-November 1970, that his extensive research into eagles over the years was a great help in creating the reverse, and that his sketches were adopted without change. The chief engraver was not given full freedom of design; he was instructed to have the layout of the obverse resemble that of the Washington quarter.|$|E

25|$|Mason was now Architect to the Auckland Provincial Council. In April 1856 {{he became}} President {{of the newly}} formed Board of Works. Amidst {{disputes}} about the new Government House {{he returned to his}} Howick Farm in February 1857. Early in 1860 <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> from this again moving into Howick village. As tension rose with Maori he became a Captain in the Auckland militia.|$|E

50|$|During {{the game}} the player can {{interact}} with several characters, most of whom, like Sergeant Kelly, give the player some briefing regarding his mission. The player character remains silent throughout and is portrayed as tough and fearless in the game's cut scenes; generally only glaring at the demons he sees. When he discovers the towering Cyberdemon for the game's final battle, however, <b>he</b> <b>steps</b> <b>back</b> in fear.|$|R
25|$|Laurent {{took a few}} steps, not speaking. He {{removed his}} jacket and vest. In shirtsleeves, he glanced again at Thérèse, who had not stirred. He seemed to hesitate. Then he noticed the pink shoulder, and bent down to press his {{trembling}} lips against that bit of bare skin. The young woman pulled her shoulder away, turning around abruptly. She stared at Laurent with a gaze so strangely mingling repugnance and dread that <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back,</b> troubled and uneasy, as if overcome with terror and disgust himself.|$|E
25|$|Relations {{between the}} {{newspapers}} of the Perscombinatie became troubled, even more after financial troubles hit the company. In 1979 <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> as direct of Het Parool and {{as chair of}} the Perscombinatie and became {{member of the board of}} commissioners of the Perscombinatie and secretary of the Parool Foundation. The Parool Foundation was the main shareholder of the Perscombinatie and the De Volkskrant was disgruntled with this. Van Norden solved the issue by having foundations of the three newspapers each appoint members to a management company that governed the Perscombinatie. In 1988 Van Norden stepped down as member of the board of commissioners. Van Norden stayed involved in journalism with editorial staff of Het Parool asking him for advice.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of February 25, 1855, Baker entered the Stanwix Hall saloon with Jim Turner and Paudeen McLaughlin to confront Poole having {{threatened}} Morrissey with a gun during an argument only hours before. Walking up to Poole, Baker spat {{in his face and}} then pulled a Colt revolver but accidentally shot himself in the arm as <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> to draw the weapon. Dropping to the floor, he did manage to fire a second shot hitting Poole in the leg and similarly incapacitating him. Both men eventually got up from the floor, however Baker managed to get to Poole first and pistol whipped him back to the ground. Baker then shot Poole twice, once in the stomach and the second in his chest, and left the saloon.|$|E

500|$|Schulz {{recalled}} {{that the first}} time <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> from the line on defense, Coach Yost was horrified. [...] Yost said, [...] "Dutchman, {{what are you trying to}} do?" [...] "Stop 'em", replied Schulz. [...] "But you're supposed to play in the line", Yost insisted. [...] "They'll run over us." [...] "Listen Yost", Schulz claims to have said, [...] "My way is best. [...] If any of 'em gets by me, I'll move back into the line and stay there". [...] Yost eventually saw the wisdom in Schulz's technique, and soon nearly all centers were backing up the line on defense.|$|E
500|$|During the 1860s, Claflin {{remained}} {{active at}} high levels of party politics, gaining appointment to [...] the national executive committee of the Republican Party in 1864. [...] In that role, he was a critical mediating force between radical and conservative factions of the party, promoting the moderate Schuyler Colfax for vice president under Ulysses S. Grant in the 1868 election. [...] In 1868 he was elected {{chairman of the national}} party. [...] He reluctantly promoted Grant for president in the 1872 election, unhappy that Grant had given patronage power in Massachusetts to the controversial ex-general Benjamin Butler. [...] <b>He</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> from the chairmanship when Henry Wilson received the vice presidential nomination.|$|E
500|$|With {{an exaggerated}} and unusual batting style, Bagwell waited for each pitch {{in a low}} crouch, with legs wide open and knees bent nearly 90 degrees, {{appearing}} {{as if he was}} sitting on an invisible bench. [...] <b>He</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> with his front foot as he began his swing. [...] Next, he would rise from his stance and rotate his hands with the bat forward into his powerful, uppercut swing. [...] "That wide stance keeps him from over striding", Joe Torre observed, [...] "which can be your biggest problem when you’re trying to hit for power." [...] The low crouch also shrunk his strike zone, allowing him to walk more often. [...] Standing 6 feet tall (...) and weighing , he did not present the image of an imposing, home run-hitting giant that would cause pitchers to be very careful when he batted after he began his major league career.|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean," [...] Forrest answered, [...] "what your {{grandfather}} {{would have told}} him, or your great grandfather, in half a dozen words weeks ago.

Why should we keep him carefully and safe, knowing that the moment <b>he</b> <b>steps</b> <b>back</b> into life you and I are doomed men?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Hullo!" [...] <b>he</b> cried, <b>stepping</b> <b>back</b> {{from the}} steely glitter as men <b>step</b> <b>back</b> from a serpent; [...] "are {{you afraid of}} burglars? or when {{and why do you}} deal death out of that machine gun?" ...|$|R
500|$|He wrote pilots for {{a series}} of his own, but these were turned down by the studios until he began work on The Lieutenant. This ran for a single season on NBC on Saturday nights.

Following the cancellation of the series, he wrote and produced his first feature film, Pretty Maids All in a Row. He also produced several new science fiction pilots; Genesis II (also re-worked into a second pilot, called Planet Earth), The Questor Tapes and Spectre. Of these, Questor was approved to go to a full season, but following disagreements between Roddenberry and the studio over suggested changes, it was canceled.|$|E
500|$|As {{his horse}} faltered and collapsed, Le Gris was thrown off {{and lost his}} axe. Undaunted, he rose and drew his longsword, turning to meet Carrouges who was already {{advancing}} on him, sword also drawn. Again the combatants traded blows, their weapons the only sounds heard in the silent battleground. Again, Le Gris' superior strength gave him an advantage, pushing Carrouges back before thrusting his blade through his opponent's thigh. As the crowd murmured, Le Gris made a fatal mistake; withdrawing his weapon, <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> to watch his wounded enemy and was thus off balance when the desperate Carrouges threw himself forwards, wrestling Le Gris {{to the ground and}} hacking at him with his own longsword. Although Le Gris' plate armour was too thick to allow Carrouges' weapon to penetrate, it was also so heavy that he could not regain his feet with Carrouges on top of him. Stranded on the ground, Le Gris struggled as Carrouges straddled him and used his sword to smash open the lock on Le Gris' faceplate. As the crowd watched in silence, Carrouges shouted in Le Gris' exposed face for him to confess his crime before death or face hell. Le Gris replied so all could hear, [...] "In the name of God, and on the peril and damnation of my soul, I am innocent of the crime". Enraged, Carrouges drew his misericordia and thrust it through Le Gris' throat, killing him instantly.|$|E
2500|$|She went up {{one story}} {{and stopped in}} between floors. The gentleman started to yell, [...] "What's wrong!" [...] I said, [...] "The {{elevator}} operator wants to kiss you." [...] Shocked, the gentleman said, [...] "But I'm a married man!" [...] The girl said, [...] "I don't mind that." [...] She walked toward him, and <b>he</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> and said, [...] "You start the elevator." [...] So she started it. She went up to about the fourth floor and stopped it again between floors. She said, [...] "I just have a craving for a kiss." [...] He said, [...] "You go about your business." [...] He wanted that elevator moving, not standing still. She replied, [...] "Well, let's go down {{and start all over}} again," [...] and she began to take the elevator down. He said, [...] "Not down, up!" [...] since he didn't want to go through that all over again.|$|E

5000|$|Not {{the least}} bit deterred, he shows up with a large {{cylinder}} of TNT and snaps, [...] "I'll show those pigs that I'm not stuck! If I can't blow it down, I'll blow it up!"

Unfortunately for him, he is too far away and his weapon explodes while he is carrying it to his target.|$|R

50|$|After St. Winifred's reliquary {{is set on}} her altar, pilgrims line up to {{make their}} {{requests}} of the saint. Prior Robert presides. Rhun approaches on his crutches. Rhun drops his crutches; as he puts his foot {{to the ground and}} climbs the stairs to the altar, the congregation can see his leg fill in and his foot untwist. He prays in an atmosphere of complete silence; when <b>he</b> <b>steps</b> <b>back,</b> his foot whole and fully functional, the church is filled with shouts of praise for the saint who has performed this miracle.|$|R
