50|$|Tyrolit was co-founded on the 13th of February 1919 by Daniel Swarovski to {{manufacture}} grinding wheels {{for the production}} of Swarovski-Crystals. During World War I, the Swarovski Group was cut off from supplies of grinding wheels and was forced to develop and produce its own grinding wheels. After the war, it was decided to commercialize this activity and to start a separate company: Tyrolit was born.In 1950, the company relocated from the Swarovski Headquarters in Wattens to a new location in Schwaz. One of the largest drivers of growth of the company was the market launch of the glass fibre reinforced cut-off and grinding wheel SECUR in 1952. The <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforcement</b> greatly improved the security of the tools against centrifugal breakage.In 1991 Tyrolit acquired the US company Diamond Products and the Swiss company Hydrostress. These acquisitions added significant presence in the market for concrete drilling and sawing systems.Further major acquisitions took place in 2004 with the purchasing of the Czech company Carborundum Electrite, in 2009 with the purchasing of the US company Radiac and in 2014 with the purchasing of the South African company Grinding Techniques.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. Traditionally, dough moulding compounds (DMCs) {{have been based on}} unsaturated polyester resins (UPR), fillers and <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforcements.</b> Such systems however are inflammable and will emit dense, toxic smoke on combustion. Phenolic resins, on the other hand, have excellent flame retardant properties, but slightly inferior mechanical properties. Phenolic DMCs are based on mineral fillers and <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforcements,</b> compounded into a phenolic resol (heat cure) resin. Compounding these systems using a co-rotating twin screw extruder, instead of the traditional method using a Z-blade mixer, results in long fibre DMCs which have better mechanical properties than short fibre DMCs. In this study, a wide range of inorganic materials, their pH being one of the selection factors, have been investigated as potential phenolic DMC fillers. Viscosity measurements were carried out on resin/filler mixtures, while on the cured samples flexural and impact properties were investigated.

In full or partial edentia the dental base can be exposed to an extreme stress concentration which may be coupled with the incidental source of failure during processing of the denture. The aim of this lecture is to report cases, where we were able to overcome dental base fracture, which had not been foreseen earlier. In the first case a history of several fractures of an upper complete denture is presented. Metal net, framework and incorporation of glass fibres and reline were stages of the instructive problem solving process. In the second case a man wearing an overdenture with ball attachments under implant fixtures is presented. After multiple fractures of the dental base we used <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforcement</b> for repair.

The static tensile, compression and flexural properties of the flax-reinforced aluminum laminates were determined. The mechanical responses of FML composites reinforced by flax alone or in combination with <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> were significantly higher than the properties measured for the flax fibre/polymer laminates. The Young&# 039;s moduli of FMLs incorporating flax fibre-reinforced laminates were comparable to those of FMLs composites incorporating <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforcements.</b> However, the ultimate tensile strength of the FML composites decreased with the progressive increase in the volume fraction of flax fibres. When the specific yield strength and specific moduli were considered, there was no variation between flax- and glass-reinforced FMLs. The notch sensitivity of the FML composites was also investigated under the tensile loading condition and it was found that flaxreinforced FMLs were relatively less notch sensitive in comparison to their glass-reinforced counterparts. Compression-loaded FML composites revealed similar mechanical response trends to those determined under the tensile loading condition. The flexural response of FMLs was found to be independent of the fibre type. The improvement in the mechanical properties of flax-polymer laminates following their hybridization with aluminum demonstrates the potential for utilizing natural fibres in structural engineering applications...|$|R

40|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforcements</b> {{form the}} {{foundation}} of a composite materials industry with a global annual production of greater than 10 million tons of high performance, light weight carbon footprint lowering materials. Possibly the most critical component involved in the manufacture of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> and their composites is the fibre sizing. Yet because of the intense level of industrial secrecy around sizings there are very few people in the vast chain of composite materials suppliers, processers and end users who have more than a superficial understanding of what <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> sizings are and what they do. There are many questions which this large and growing composite community poses about <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> sizings. Which analytical techniques are most useful in sizing research? Who has published research results on sizing and their ingredients? Which silanes are the most researched for use in sizings? Which <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> manufacturers have reported research findings on sizings? This review will act as a guide to obtaining some of the answers to these and many other questions about <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> sizings. The composites materials industry is currently experiencing a period of intense growth in new application development due to the potential which light-weight high performance composite materials have to reduce the carbon footprint of many industries. Composite materials have been highly successful in such applications due to the synergy of combining two, or more, dissimilar materials to obtain a better performance than the sum of the individual components. <b>Glass</b> <b>fibre</b> has been particularly successful as the reinforcement in these composites. Today <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> products account for more than 95 % of <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforcements</b> used in the composites industry, primarily due to their highly attractive performance to price ratio. Possibly the most critical component involved in the manufacture of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> and their composites is the fibre sizing. Sizing is a thin surface coating of mainly organic materials applied to nearly all types of man-made fibres during their manufacture. Given the well-recognized critical importance of sizing in all aspects of the profitability, processibility and performance of glass reinforced composites and consequently to the ultimate success of the composites industry, it is surprising (perhaps even astonishing) to note the lack of a proportionally sized body of fundamental and applied research publications on this subject. There can be few examples of such a large materials industry (global annual production well in excess of 10 million tons of fibre reinforced composites) where the manufacturing and performance of those materials are so critically dependent on such a small component that is so narrowly understood. The research and development of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> sizing is inextricably linked to the intellectual property concerns of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> manufacturers and consequently information {{on the nature of the}} technical challenges facing sizing developers is not openly available to the technical community.

In order to investigate the shear strength of glass fibre reinforced TSLs, an improved punch test was developed: the steel ring is replaced by TSL plates and four screws are used to tighten the TSL sample between the clamping plates to ensure stable and symmetrical loading. Four different glass fibre contents were tested to evaluate the effect of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforcement</b> on the shear strength of TSLs. The effect of loading rate was studied. The results suggest that the steel punch can shear through the polymer sheet well and the failure mode can be easily identified. The results are consistent and easily calculated. The shear strength increases with glass fibre content. The TSL material samples showed good linear behaviour prior to reaching ultimate load and ductile behaviour that reflects the fibre reinforcement of failed resin during the yielding stage of the sample, which is beneficial to support in underground mines. Although there may be some impact of the shearing rate on the shear strength, the effect is negligible for the loading rates used...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the Vickers hardness of different acrylic resins for denture bases {{with and without}} the addition of glass fibres. Background: It {{has been suggested that}} different polymerisation methods, as well as the addition of glass fibre (FV) might improve the hardness of acrylic. Materials and methods: Five types of acrylic resin were tested: Vipi Wave (VW), microwave polymerisation; Vipi Flash (VF), auto-polymerisation; Lucitone (LT), QC 20 (QC) and Vipi Cril (VC), conventional heat-polymerisation, all with or without <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforcement</b> (GFR) and distributed into 10 groups (n = 12). Specimens were then submitted to Vickers hardness testing with a 25 -g load for 30 s. All data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test. Results: A significant statistical difference was observed with regard to the polymerisation method and the GFR (p < 0. 05). Without the GFR, the acrylic resin VC presented the highest hardness values, and VF and LT presented the lowest. In the presence of GFR, VC resin still presented the highest Vickers hardness values, and VF and QC presented the lowest. Conclusions: The acrylic resin VC and VW presented higher hardness values than VF and QC resins. Moreover, GFR increased the Vickers hardness of resins VW, VC and LT...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} the experimental results of steel fibre reinforced concrete beams with externally bonded <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer laminates {{with a view}} to study their strength and ductility. Three types of beams were tested in the laboratory. Three fibre reinforced concrete beams were used as reference beams. Six fibre reinforced concrete beams were provided with externally bonded GFRP laminates. One concrete beam was left virgin without any <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and external GFRP laminates. All the beams were tested until failure. The variables considered included volume fraction of <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and stiffness of <b>Glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer laminates. The static responses of all the beams were evaluated in terms of strength, stiffness and ductility. The experimental results show that the beams provided with steel fibres and externally bonded <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer laminates exhibit improved performance in all the aspects over the beams with internal <b>fibre</b> <b>reinforcement...</b>|$|R
50|$|The façades are characterised by {{tiers of}} repeating arched white frames around {{recessed}} windows of bronze-tinted glass, with each tier {{separated by a}} black granite string course which incorporates hidden drainage. The cladding units are pre-cast double-skinned 1.5 m wide modules of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced cement (GRC), using a mixture of Portland cement with 5% alkali-resistant <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> as <b>reinforcement.</b> It was the first building {{in the world to}} be entirely clad with GRC panels. Triple-width modules on the ground floor 4.5 m wide have two canted windowpanes meeting at an angle, with similar modules repeated on upper floors to either side of the entrances. The slim profile and light weight of the GRC panels allowed the architect to slope the walls outward at an angle of five degrees, with each floor slightly larger than the one below, creating extra square metres of office space. The units of the partial upper floor are inverted, creating a roof line that resembles a crown to the north side and at the eastern end; a roof deck occupies at the south-western corner. Railings on the street have shapes similar to the cladding panels.|$|R
40|$|Sandwich structures, {{which are}} made of metal face sheet and foam core, are widely been used in various {{industries}} due to their excellent energy absorption and impact resistance properties. Recently, fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites {{have been used in}} the fabrication of face sheets of sandwich panel due to their high specific strength and stiffness properties. The usage of hybrid FRP composite laminate is still new and few researches were found in this area. On top of that, the research data on aluminium foam as a core material in sandwich panel is also limited and need to be further studied. This research is aimed to determine the damage resistance and damage tolerance of hybrid FRP-aluminium foam sandwich panel. Damage resistance refers to the resistance of a material to damage when it is subjected to impact loading and damage tolerance is the ability of a material or structure to perform safely after damage. In this study, damage resistance is measured using impact test and damage tolerance is determined using compression after impact (CAI) test. In addition the bending test was also conducted in order to determine mechanical properties of the material, such as Young's modulus and strength. The sandwich panels were prepared using FRP composites face sheets, which consist of carbon and <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> <b>reinforcements</b> and epoxy matrix, and closed-cell aluminium foam core material. Drop weight impact, CAI and three-point bending tests were conducted in order to evaluate the properties of hybrid FRP-aluminium foam sandwich panel when compared to those of the pristine materials and aluminium honeycomb sandwich panel. The results showed that the hybrid FRP-aluminium foam sandwich panel has higher damage resistance or impact properties which were represented by higher peak force, energy absorption and specific energy absorption of 42...|$|R
