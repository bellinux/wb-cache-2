5000|$|Adults have a {{relatively}} short tail with the two central (deck) feathers being square-tipped and somewhat longer than their lighter, outer tail feathers giving the bird its distinctive name. The plumage is mottled dark and light browns against a white background, they are lighter on the underparts with a white belly uniformly covered in faint [...] "V"-shaped markings. These markings distinguish sharp-tailed grouse from lesser and greater prairie chickens which are heavily barred on their underparts(Connelly et al. 1998). Adult males have a yellow comb over their eyes and a violet display patch on their neck. This display patch is another distinguishing characteristic from prairie chickens as male prairie chickens have yellow or orange colored air sacs(Connelly et al. 1998).

40|$|Flight <b>feather</b> <b>shaft</b> of {{long-eared owl}} is {{characterized}} by a three-parameter model for linear viscoelastic solids to reveal its damping ability. Uniaxial tensile tests of the long-eared owl, pigeon, and golden eagle flight <b>feather</b> <b>shaft</b> specimens were carried out based on Instron 3345 single column material testing system, respectively, and viscoelastic response of their stress and strain was described by the standard linear solid model. Parameter fitting result obtained from the tensile tests shows that there is no significant difference in instantaneous elastic modulus for the three birds’ feather shafts, but the owl shaft has the highest viscosity, implying more obvious viscoelastic performance. Dynamic mechanical property was characterized based on the tensile testing results. Loss factor (tanδ) of the owl flight <b>feather</b> <b>shaft</b> was calculated to be 1. 609 ± 0. 238, far greater than those of the pigeon (0. 896 ± 0. 082) and golden eagle (1. 087 ± 0. 074).

40|$|Keratinous {{materials}} are omnipresent, encompassing terrestrial, aerial and aquatic territories; they form diverse epidermal appendages and serve various interesting functions, triggering the curiosity {{of humans and}} inspiring the inventions of novel structures. Among these, pangolin scales and the <b>feather</b> <b>shaft</b> are systematically and analytically studied, answering the questions how the scales function as an armor and the shaft fulfills flight, which contribute to advancing the current knowledge of natural keratinous materials and providing valuable insights in developing new bioinspired designs. The pangolin is the only known mammal that has keratinous scales covering the main body. Arboreal and ground pangolin scales show an overlapping pattern in a hexagonal arrangement to provide multi-layered coverage. Scales show three regions in the solid interior that features flattened cells forming crossed lamellae, rarely seen in most keratinous materials. Two dimensional x-ray diffraction reveals the presence of α-helices and possible β-sheet, and the microfibrils are crossed {{in a range of}} directions. Scales show an interlocking interface between lamellae, which results from the suture-like cell membrane complex. Scales are transverse isotropic and show a strain-rate dependence, which favor the function in resisting external forces from multi-directions. The <b>feather</b> <b>shaft,</b> a naturally refined lightweight and stiff flight material, is distinguished in having a changing shape factor: circular at the calamus but square towards the distal rachis; this produces a tailored flexural stiffness along the shaft length fulfilling the local stress requirements. The cortex has a complex fibrous hierarchical structure, both making the shaft longitudinally strong, dorsal-ventrally stiff and torsionally rigid, yet capable of desirable deflection and twisting. Filling the cortex with foamy medulla introduces a synergistic strengthening and toughening mechanisms. Flexure of the shaft reveals decreasing flexural properties towards the distal end; nevertheless, the density-normalized flexural stiffness almost remains the same, and the specific flexural strength increases by 48 % at the distal shaft.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Twelve ancient {{artifacts}} or fragmented feather samples {{recovered from}} melting alpine ice patches in southern Yukon were analyzed {{in order to}} identify the species of birds associated with the ice patches or used on weapons recovered from these sites. The identification of bird species used by ancient hunters as long ago as 4500 BP enhances our insight into the customs, culture, and sophistication of life at that time. Downy feather barbs were found on two samples and microscopically identified as duck (Anatidae) and falcon (Falconidae). Further examination and comparisons using museum specimens resulted in a total of six identifications: Anatidae, eagle (Aquila or Haliaeetus), gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus), white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), and northern flicker (Colaptes auratus luteus). Three of the feather samples were complete enough to show apparent modification, or notching, along the <b>feather</b> <b>shaft.</b> The identification of non-game birds such as gyrfalcon and eagles, together with evidence of possible worked or notched feathers, indicates that as long as 4500 years ago, Subarctic hunters selected feathers not only for their utility in fletching, but also possibly for symbolic or decorative purposes.

40|$|Feather holes have {{traditionally}} been suggested to be feeding traces of chewing lice (mallophagans). There is controversy whether mallophagans are the real source of feather holes. We studied mallophagan infestations and holes in tail feathers of 528 rock ptarmigan Lagopus muta collected 2007 – 2012 in northeast Iceland. Three mallophagans were found, Amyrsidea lagopi (prevalence 13 %), Goniodes lagopi (72 %) and Lagopoecus affinis (51 %). The prevalence of feather holes was 15 % and based on pattern the holes could be separated into two groups termed feather hole swarms (FHS), prevalence 9 %, and single holes (SH), prevalence 6 %. Holes for FHS were concentrated in the central tail feathers and decreased outwards, but holes for SH did not show any such pattern. There was a significant positive relationship {{between the number of}} holes for FHS birds and A. lagopi number, and the prevalence was similar. No other combinations of FHS or SH and the mallophagans indicated any relationship. The observed differences between FHS and SH suggest that feather holes have different origin. Our thesis based on known feeding habits of amblycerans like A. lagopi is that the holes in FHS are created during the pin feather stage when the lice bite the pin feather to draw blood. The holes in FHS were often in lines parallel to the <b>feather</b> <b>shaft</b> and the distance between adjacent holes was similar to the daily growth band, and where apparent the holes were sitting in the light portion of the band suggesting diurnal rhythm in lice feeding activity. Concluding, feather holes in ptarmigan may have various origins, but there is a clear correlation between the presence and numbers of A. lagopi and FHS. This is a novel finding for the grouse family and the genus Amyrsidea and should be a valuable contribution to the studies of feather hole formation.

40|$|In this study, {{certain aspects}} of psittacine beak and feather disease and {{budgerigar}} fledgling disease were investigated to gather information about the distribution and the clinical manifestation of the diseases in patients of the “Klinik für Vögel der LMU München”. Furthermore different organ samples were compared for their reliability of routine post mortem PCR-diagnoses of peracute PBFD in young african grey parrots. Regarding intra vitam detection of the aetiological agents of both diseases (BFDV and BFPyV), following observations were made: while in birds with physiological plumage, DNA of neither virus could be detected (BFDV: n = 79; BFPyV: n = 47), birds with feather disorders were regularly BFDV (18. 2 %) and BFPyV (10. 7 %) positive. In psittacines with feathering disorders an BFPyV-infection was only seen in budgerigars. The six affected budgerigars show acute loss of flight and tail feathers. In two birds a concurrent infection of BFPyV and BFDV could be detected {{and in one of}} the two birds a deformation of feathers could be seen. Characteristic feather disorders, as discribed for chronic PBFD, like constriction in feather sheats, remaining feather sleeves, discolouration as well as hemorrhages in the <b>feather</b> <b>shaft,</b> were only present in nine of the 24 BFDV-positive birds. The clinical signs of the remaining 15 BFDV-infected birds were only feather loss and feather picking. In contrast to BFPyV-infection, which could only be detected in budgerigars, the BFDV positive birds belong to different species of the order Psittaciformes. The testing of intra vitam samples showed, that in four of the BFDV-positive birds viral DNA could not be detected in all samples tested (2 x cloacal swab, 1 x blood, 1 x blood and cloacal swab). To increase the reliability of intra vitam diagnosis all three samples should be taken for virus detection. Within the group of birds presented for necropsy, the share of BFDV- and BFPyVpositive birds was even higher (25. 5 % and 21. 9 %) as in birds with feather disorders. In these birds a BFPyV-infection could be demonstrated in samples of seven birds of different species under the age of one year. Besides one budgerigar, who died of a streptococcus septicemia, all 13 BFDV-positive birds, who died with physiological plumage, were young african grey parrots. By testing DNA dilutions of different organ samples (skin-with-feather, spleen, bursa of Fabricius and liver) of young grey parrots suffering from peracute PBFD, an infection could be proven in 29 of 34 birds. In positive birds viral DNA of BFDV could be detected in all organ samples except for three single samples (2 x bursa of Fabricius and 1 x liver). But using undiluted isolated DNA, a great part of the spleen- (19 of 28) and bursa of Fabricius-samples (13 of 25) and a smaller part of liver- (6 of 28) and skin-with-feather-samples (3 of 29) gave a negative result Because of the high number of false negative PCR-tests the labarotories need to establish reliable internal controls PCR-diagnostic.
