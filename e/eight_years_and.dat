5|$|After the war, five Croatian {{fighters were}} charged and convicted of eleven counts of murder, one of {{attempted}} murder, {{and one of}} torture of Serb civilians found in the JNA barracks, which surrendered on 15 September 1991. They received prison sentences of between five and eight years. Glavaš, who was tried alongside them for the same crimes, received a ten-year sentence. Before the conviction became final in 2009, and to avoid extradition, Glavaš fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he had granted citizenship. His sentence was reduced to <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> became final in 2010, {{when he was arrested}} and imprisoned in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The European Central Bank plans to redesign the notes every seven or <b>eight</b> <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> a second series of banknotes is already in preparation. New production and anti-counterfeiting techniques will be employed on the new notes, but the design will be of the same theme and colours identical to the current series: bridges and arches.

The manufacture of radiation-treated hardwood flooring continued until 2002. Pennsylvania reacquired the land in 1963 and 1967, and in 1965 established Quehanna as a wild area, albeit one with a nuclear facility and industrial complex. The cleanup of the reactor and hot cells took over <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> cost $30million; the facility was demolished and its nuclear license terminated in 2009. Since 1992 the industrial complex has been home to Quehanna Motivational Boot Camp, a minimum-security prison.

5|$|During {{this time}} Treatt {{witnessed}} the break-up of the UAP into the various parties including the Democratic Party, which he joined, {{and then the}} establishment of the Liberal Party of Australia as the major conservative political force in Australia in 1945. When the second leader of the party, Alexander Mair, resigned in March 1946, Treatt was elected to succeed him. As the third leader of the new party, Treatt became the first leader to contest an election. After serving <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> almost winning government at the 1950 election, Treatt resigned as Leader in August 1954 following a July attempt to depose him. He continued as a member of parliament until he was defeated in 1962 and thereafter served in various organisations and posts, including as a Chief Commissioner of the City of Sydney in 1969, until his death in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Flamininus {{replied to}} Nabis by proposing his own terms, under which Sparta and Rome would {{conclude}} a six-month truce if Nabis would surrender Argos {{with all his}} garrisons from the Argolid; give the coastal Laconian cities autonomy and give them his fleet; pay a war indemnity over the next <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> not enter into alliances with any Cretan cities. Nabis rejected this offer, claiming that he had enough supplies to withstand a siege. Flamininus therefore led his force of 50,000 men to Sparta and, after defeating the Spartans in a battle outside the city, began investing the city. Flamininus resolved not to lay a regular siege to the city but to instead try and storm it. The Spartans initially held out against the allies, but their resistance was hampered {{by the fact that}} the Romans' large shields made missile attacks futile.|$|E
5|$|It is {{conceivable}} that Ímar received some form of support from Knútr's son and successor in Britain, Haraldr Knútsson, King of England (died 1040). The latter was certainly in power when Ímar replaced Echmarcach, and an association between Ímar and Haraldr could explain why the Annals of Ulster reports the latter's death two years later. Ímar's reign lasted about <b>eight</b> <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> {{one of his first}} royal acts appears to have been the invasion of Rathlin Island within the year. The fact that he proceeded to campaign in the North Channel could indicate that Echmarcach had held power in this region before his acquisition of Mann and Dublin.|$|E

5|$|Klaus Ebner {{was born}} on 8 August 1964 in Vienna, Austria, where he grew up. His mother, Ingeborg (b. 1944), worked as a hairdresser and his father, Walter (19391996), was a {{salesman}} who sold home entertainment products in the 1970s and later. His sister was born in 1969; the family moved one year later. Ebner attended Secondary School for <b>eight</b> <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> his first writing experiences date back to this time; {{at the age of}} twelve he wrote a short theater play and rehearsed it with his friends at school.

5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 1956–57 season, the {{selectors}} met {{to choose}} a team for a short non-Test tour of New Zealand. The leading contender for the captaincy was 28-year-old Victorian Neil Harvey, who had been a regular member of the team for <b>eight</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> was the senior batsman. However, both Harvey and Miller had been criticised for their attitude towards Johnson in an official report to the board about the 1956 tour. The selectors thus thrust Craig into the leadership at the age of 21 and a half. He was a young player leading an inexperienced team—the youngest cricket team from any country to be sent overseas, with no players older than 30. It was seen as a bold move, as Craig had only played six Tests, was far from being a regular member of the team and had only a year of captaincy at first-class level.|$|E

He was a productive scholar after his retirement, writing three books as well as numerous essays and talks expanding the arguments of Preface to Plato to a generalised argument about the effect of literacy on Greek thought, literature, culture, society, and law.|$|E
