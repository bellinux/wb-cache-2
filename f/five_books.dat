5|$|Many {{fragments}} {{that are}} securely {{attributed to the}} Catalogue, {{some of which are}} relatively substantial, cannot be placed within the poem because their content is either too obscure or could be assigned to different individuals or genealogies which are themselves difficult to locate within the <b>five</b> <b>books.</b>|$|E

5|$|John Sigismund {{appointed}} a Calvinist bishop {{as the only}} religious leader of the Romanians in his realm in November 1566. The Diet also ordered that all Romanian priests who refused to convert to Calvinism were to be expelled, but this decision was not carried out.

5|$|Tacitus' major {{historical}} works, including The Histories and Agricola's biography, {{were all}} written and published under Domitian's successors Nerva (96–98) and Trajan (98–117). Unfortunately, {{the part of}} Tacitus' Histories dealing with {{the reign of the}} Flavian dynasty is almost entirely lost. His views on Domitian survive through brief comments in its first <b>five</b> <b>books,</b> and the short but highly negative characterization in Agricola in which he severely criticizes Domitian's military endeavours. Nevertheless, Tacitus admits his debt to the Flavians with regard to his own public career.|$|E

5|$|According to the Suda, the Catalogue was <b>five</b> <b>books</b> long. The {{length of}} each is unknown, {{but it is}} likely that the entire poem {{consisted}} of anywhere from 4000 to over 5000 lines. The majority of the content was structured around major genealogical units: the descendants of Aeolus were found in book 1 and at least part of book 2, followed by those of Inachus, Pelasgus, Atlas and Pelops in the later books. It is believed that a rough guide to this structure can be found in the Bibliotheca, a Roman-era mythological handbook transmitted under the name of Apollodorus of Athens which used the Catalogue as a primary source for many genealogical details and appears to have followed reflect the poem's overall arrangement.|$|E

5|$|After {{the move}} to Exeter, Leofric worked to {{increase}} the endowment of the diocese, and especially the cathedral library, which he found almost empty upon his arrival. He later claimed that there were only <b>five</b> <b>books</b> owned by the cathedral chapter when he became bishop. He still remained on good terms with the king, for he was present at Edward's Christmas court in 1065 that saw the consecration of Edward's Westminster Abbey church at Westminster. No evidence survives that Leofric was employed by the king in any diplomatic missions, nor does Leofric appear to have attended any papal councils or synods. He was {{a supporter of the}} cult of Leo IX, who was proclaimed a saint after Leo's death.|$|E

5|$|Icke visited Shine four times. During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke felt {{something}} like a spider's web on his face, and Shine told him she had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write <b>five</b> <b>books</b> in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E

5|$|Jewish {{religion}} was unusual in that Jews acknowledged only one God, they considered themselves chosen by him, {{and they wanted}} Gentiles to accept their God as the only God. Jews based their faith and religious practice on the Torah, <b>five</b> <b>books</b> {{said to have been}} given by God to Moses. The three prominent religious parties were the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Sadducees. Together these parties represented {{only a small fraction of}} the population. Most Jews looked forward to a time that God would deliver them from their pagan rulers, possibly through war against the Romans.|$|E
5|$|Upon its discovery, the Astronomica was read, commented upon, {{and edited}} {{by a number}} of scholars. Nevertheless, it failed to become as popular as other {{classical}} Latin poems and was neglected for centuries. This started to change during the early 20th century when, between 1903 and 1930, the classicist A. E. Housman published a critically acclaimed edition of the poem in <b>five</b> <b>books.</b> Housman's work was followed by the Latinist G. P. Goold's lauded English translation in 1977. Today, scholars consider the Astronomica to be highly technical, complicated, and occasionally contradictory; at the same time, many have praised Manilius's ability to translate complex mathematical computations into poetic verse.|$|E

5|$|Epic {{poetry is}} a genre of poetry, {{and a major}} form of {{narrative}} literature. This genre is often defined as lengthy poems concerning events of a heroic or important nature {{to the culture of}} the time. It recounts, in a continuous narrative, the life and works of a heroic or mythological person or group of persons. Examples of epic poems are Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, the Nibelungenlied, Luís de Camões' Os Lusíadas, the Cantar de Mio Cid, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Mahabharata, Valmiki's Ramayana, Ferdowsi's Shahnama, Nizami (or Nezami)'s Khamse (<b>Five</b> <b>Books),</b> and the Epic of King Gesar. While the composition of epic poetry, and of long poems generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written. Derek Walcott won a Nobel prize to a great extent {{on the basis of his}} epic, Omeros.|$|E
