5|$|An {{incident}} in Žirmūnai's history {{that has been}} difficult to reconstruct occurred in 1975, when a pontoon bridge across the River Neris, that was customarily set up from spring to autumn, collapsed due to the weight of a crowd returning from a concert in the Palace of Concerts and Sports. It was rumoured that the bridge supports were not <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> at the time. There were witnessed fatalities involving drownings and crushing by the bridge structures. Public discussion of the disaster was restricted and the number of casualties remains unknown. The pontoon bridge was never re-erected at the site; the Mindaugas Bridge now serves this need.|$|E

25|$|A {{convolutional}} {{neural network}} (CNN) is a class of deep, feed-forward networks, composed {{of one or more}} convolutional layers with <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> layers (matching those in typical ANNs) on top. It uses tied weights and pooling layers. In particular, max-pooling is often structured via Fukushima's convolutional architecture. This architecture allows CNNs {{to take advantage of the}} 2D structure of input data.|$|E
25|$|To {{regulate}} {{the flow of}} water {{into and out of the}} wetlands, the parks department adds or removes boards at a small dam near the railroad berm. The idea is to replicate conditions that existed when the wetlands were <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> to the river. Part of the water in the wetlands comes from natural springs, and part of the water comes from the river, when it runs high in the winter. Beavers have at times foiled the plan by damming the small stream that carries water between the lake and the river. The parks department has foiled the rodents by running a perforated pipe through the beaver dam.|$|E
50|$|The new railway did not <b>fully</b> <b>connect</b> {{with the}} Burmese system, as no bridge crossed the river between Moulmein {{on the south}} bank with Martaban on the north bank. Thus ferries were needed. A bridge was not built until Thanlwin Bridge in 2000-05.|$|R

25|$|These {{can be used}} {{to output}} object {{bounding}} boxes {{in the form of a}} binary mask. They are also used for multi-scale regression to increase localization precision. DNN-based regression can learn features that capture geometric information, in addition to serving as a good classifier. They remove the requirement to explicitly model parts and their relations. This helps to broaden the variety of objects that can be learned. The model consists of multiple layers, each of which has a rectified linear unit as its activation function for non-linear transformation. Some layers are convolutional, while others are <b>fully</b> <b>connected.</b> Every convolutional layer has an additional max pooling. The network is trained to minimize L2 error for predicting the mask ranging over the entire training set containing bounding boxes represented as masks.|$|E
25|$|The D-Wave 2X system hosted at NASA Ames Research Center {{has been}} {{recently}} {{used for the}} learning of a special class of restricted Boltzmann machines that {{can serve as a}} building block for deep learning architectures. Complementary work that appeared roughly simultaneously showed that quantum annealing can be used for supervised learning in classification tasks. The same device was later used to train a <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> Boltzmann machine to generate, reconstruct, and classify down-scaled, low-resolution handwritten digits, among other synthetic datasets. In both cases, the models trained by quantum annealing had a similar or better performance in terms of quality. The ultimate question that drives this endeavour is whether there is quantum speedup in sampling applications. Experience with the use of quantum annealers for combinatorial optimization suggests the answer is not straightforward.|$|E
25|$|Quantum {{annealing}} is not {{the only}} technology for sampling. In a prepare and measure scenario, a universal quantum computer prepares a thermal state, which is then sampled by measurements. This can reduce the time required to train a deep restricted Boltzmann machine, and provide a richer and more comprehensive framework for deep learning than classical computing. The same quantum methods also permit efficient training of full Boltzmann machines and multi-layer, <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> models and do not have well-known classical counterparts. Relying on an efficient thermal state preparation protocol starting from an arbitrary state, quantum-enhanced Markov logic networks exploit the symmetries and the locality structure of the probabilistic graphical model generated by a first-order logic template. This provides an exponential reduction in computational complexity in probabilistic inference, and, while the protocol relies on a universal quantum computer, under mild assumptions it can be embedded on contemporary quantum annealing hardware.|$|E

2500|$|It can {{be shown}} that a finite state {{irreducible}} Markov chain is ergodic if it has an aperiodic state.

In the summer of 1991, a wooden-covered bridge was built that connected the second floors of 'B' and 'C' wing to help students transition from classes more quickly. In the 90's, the open area where the bridge had previously been built was enclosed to create more classrooms, and to <b>fully</b> <b>connect</b> 'B' and 'C' wings.|$|R

2500|$|Jim Parsons {{was born}} at St. Joseph Hospital in Houston, Texas, and was raised {{in one of its}} {{northern}} suburbs, Spring. He is the son of Milton Joseph [...] "Mickey/Jack" [...] Parsons, Jr. (February 6, 1949 – April 29, 2001) and teacher Judy Ann (née McKnight). His sister Julie Ann Parsons is also a teacher. He attended Klein Oak High School in Spring.

2500|$|ICT {{businesses}} have experienced an important development with {{the deployment of}} optical fibre in the agglomeration and the implantation of companies specialising in information technology, networks and image processing. The technopoles [...] of Helioparc (close to the University, 1,000 jobs), Pau Cité Multimédia (north of the town, 700 jobs) and the @LLEES (Villa Ridgway built in 1905, former headquarters of Elf) concentrate {{a large number of}} systems integration and computer engineering information technology consulting schools. Pau should, ultimately, be <b>fully</b> <b>connected</b> to a fibre optic network (Pau Broadband Country) of the agglomeration of Pau-Pyrénées communities which will allow a data transfer rate of 10 to 100 megabits per second (and 1 gigabit per second for some companies) and applications of types such as VoIP, online services and webTV. Pau is the third city in Europe, after Stockholm and Milan, to have developed a very high-speed fibre optic network. The project has cost 30 million euros and has been spread over five years. This network has encouraged the location of French and foreign companies to Pau, which are specialised in imaging, services or design online.|$|E
