5|$|By Sept. 2, 1871, Polaris {{had reached}} her furthest north of 82°29'N. Tension flared {{again as the}} three leading {{officers}} could not agree on whether to proceed further or not.

Much of this press coverage took a negative stance toward the EU, mainstream newspapers like the Daily Mail, The Telegraph and The Times promoting Eurosceptic sentiment.

The following year, it received a negative review from Michael Ignatieff in the London Review of Books. Reviewers faulted the work on grounds such as the questionable representativeness of its sample of homosexuals, though those who reviewed it positively praised it for reasons including the sophistication of its path analysis.|$|E

40|$|A {{main purpose}} of this paper is to trace the roots of modern discussions about animal ethics. First, I sort out and survey major discussions about modern animal ethics.

Additionally, I track back <b>discussions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seventeenth century, as a germ of <b>discussions</b> <b>in</b> eighteenth- century England, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of animal experiments, such as vivisection.

5|$|A bowler of express pace, Lindwall was {{a regular}} member of the Test team and had opened Australia’s attack since the {{resumption}} of cricket following World War II. During the Australian summer of 1946–47, Lindwall played in all five Tests against the touring Indian cricket team. He played a major part in Australia's 4–0 series win as the leading wicket-taker with 18 scalps {{at an average of}} 16.88, ahead of Ian Johnson and Bill Johnston who took 16 apiece at averages of 16.31 and 11.37 respectively. As a result, Lindwall was selected as part of Don Bradman's Invincibles that toured England without defeat in 1948, with the intention of leading the pace attack. There were two concerns for Lindwall in the lead-up to the tour. Lindwall had been playing with an injured leg tendon and his foot drag during the delivery stride led to <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media and among umpires as to its legality.|$|E
5|$|An {{article in}} The Times on 17 February 1919 by Rudyard Kipling carried the Commission's {{proposal}} {{to a wider}} audience and described what the graves would look like. The article entitled War Graves: Work of Imperial Commission: Mr. Kipling's Survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet, Graves of the Fallen. The illustrated booklet was intended to soften the impact of Kenyon's report as it included illustrations of cemeteries with mature trees and shrubs; contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos. There was an immediate public outcry following {{the publication of the}} reports, particularly with regards to the decision to not repatriate the bodies of the dead. The reports generated considerable <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> press which ultimately led to a heated debate in Parliament on 4 May 1920. Sir James Remnant started the debate, followed by speeches by William Burdett-Coutts in favour of the Commission's principles and Robert Cecil speaking for those desiring repatriation and opposing uniformity of grave markers. Winston Churchill closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote. Remnant withdrew his motion, allowing the Commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles.|$|E
5|$|From 1993 to 1995 {{a presidential}} decree on {{measures}} {{to prevent future}} abuse of psychiatry was being drafted at the Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression.

It correlated the archival data presented to Gushansky with materials received during his visits, conducted jointly with the commission of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia, to several strict-regime psychiatric hospitals (former Special Hospitals under MVD control). When the materials for <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Commission for Rehabilitation of the Victims of Political Repression were ready, however, the work came to a standstill.

5|$|Symbolism is used {{heavily in}} Blue Velvet. The most {{consistent}} symbolism {{in the film}} is an insect motif introduced {{at the end of}} the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban, Reaganesque paradise. The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like gas mask that Frank wears, but also the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims to be an insect exterminator. One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a type of wasp. Finally, a robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last scene of the film. The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} and use of the term Wicca within contemporary Paganism has been a recurring topic of <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of Pagan studies. The majority of academics and independent scholars use the first, more inclusive definition. Given its historical status and prevalent usage within Paganism, Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White thought it the logical and easier choice for academia, although there is still some disagreement and confusion among researchers as to what defines Wicca. Among those who have used the former definition are American sociologist Margot Adler, literary scholar Chas S. Clifton, and religious studies scholar Aidan A. Kelly, while others such as the Britons Graham Harvey and Ronald Hutton failed to make their usage clear. To deal with this problem in future, Doyle White urged scholars to specify which definition they used in their work.|$|E
5|$|Within this unitary framework, Turkey is {{subdivided}} into 81 provinces (il or vilayet) for administrative purposes. Each province {{is divided into}} districts (ilçe), {{for a total of}} 923 districts. Turkey is also {{subdivided into}} 7 regions (bölge) and 21 subregions for geographic, demographic and economic purposes; this does not refer to an administrative division. The centralised structure of decision-making in Ankara is considered by some academicians as an impediment to good local governance, and occasionally causes resentment in the municipalities of urban centres that are inhabited largely by ethnic minority groups, such as the Kurds. Steps towards decentralisation since 2004 have proven to be a highly controversial topic in Turkey. The efforts to decentralise the administrative structure are also driven by the European Charter of Local Self-Government and with Chapter 22 ("Regional Policy & Coordination of Structural Instruments") of the acquis of the European Union. A decentralisation program for Turkey has been a topic of <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country's academics, politics and the broader public.|$|E

5|$|In 1991 Berlin's public {{prosecution}} department rendered {{this incident}} assistance in emergency and self-defence in {{consequence of the}} police officer stating that he felt his life being threatened. In many cases West Berliner rescuers {{were not able to}} reach wounded persons because they were either on GDR territory or in East Berlin. They had no authorization to set foot into this territory, so that a trespassing would have been life-endangering for the rescue workers. The four children Çetin Mert, Cengaver Katrancı, Siegfried Kroboth and Giuseppe Savoca, who fell into the Spree at the Gröben riverside between the years 1972 and 1975, could not be rescued even though West Berlin rescue forces arrived quickly on site. In April 1983 the transit passenger Rudolf Burkert {{died of a heart attack}} during an interrogation at the border checkpoint Derwitz. During a subsequent autopsy in West Germany several external injuries were detected, so that an external forceful impact could not be ruled out as the cause of death. This lethal incident resulted not only in negative press reports but also led to an intervention by Helmut Kohl and Franz Josef Strauss. For the imminent public-sector loans they imposed on the GDR the condition to conduct humane border controls. Two further deaths of West Germans in transit traffic, shortly after Burkert's death, set off demonstrations against the GDR regime and a broad media <b>discussion.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> period that followed inspections decreased in transit traffic.|$|E
