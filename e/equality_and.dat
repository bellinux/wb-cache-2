40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} finding {{solutions}} {{of a system of}} multivariate polynomial <b>equalities</b> <b>and</b> inequalities in the max algebra is equivalent to solving an Extended Linear Complementarity Problem. This allows us to find all solutions of such a system of multivariate polynomial <b>equalities</b> <b>and</b> inequalities and provides a geometrical insight {{in the structure of the}} solution set. We also demonstrate that this enables us to solve many important problems in the max algebra and the max-min-plus algebra such as matrix decompositions, construction of matrices with a given characteristic polynomial, state space transformations and the (minimal) state space realization problem. Keywords: max algebra, multivariate max-algebraic polynomial <b>equalities</b> <b>and</b> inequalities, state space models, extended linear complementarity problem...|$|R

In addition the United Nations global goals address many issues related to women's health, both directly and indirectly. These include the 2000 Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and their successor, the Sustainable Development Goals adopted in September 2015, following the report on progress towards the MDGs (The Millennium Development Goals Report 2015). For instance the eight MDG goals, eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender <b>equality</b> <b>and</b> empowering women, reducing child mortality rates, improving maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS malaria and other diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability, and developing a global partnership for development, all impact on women's health, as do all seventeen SDG goals, in addition to the specific SDG5: Achieve gender <b>equality</b> <b>and</b> empower all women and girls.|$|E

However, {{with the emergence of}} the feminist movement {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's <b>equality</b> <b>and</b> critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.|$|E

Tunis' work often protested the increasing professionalization of sports in America. He believed that amateur participation in sports taught values important for good citizenship like perseverance, fair play and <b>equality,</b> <b>and</b> that the emphasis on professional sports was turning America into a country of spectators. His sports books also tackled current social issues such as antisemitism and racial equality.|$|E

5|$|Belgrano studied {{near the}} {{intellectual}} elite of Spain, {{and by that}} time there were heated discussions about the ongoing French Revolution. The principles of <b>equality</b> <b>and</b> freedom, the universal scope of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, and criticism of the divine right of kings were constant topics of debate. Among the supporters of these ideas it was thought that Spain should be remade under similar principles, and critics of such thought were rejected as tyrants or proponents of outdated ideas. However, the Spanish Enlightenment was slightly different from the French one as it still respected religion and the monarchy. Thus, despite the new influences, Belgrano remained a strong Catholic and monarchist.|$|E

Du Bois restated the resolutions of the congress in his Manifesto To the League of Nations, which implored the newly formed League of Nations to address labor issues and to appoint Africans to key posts. The League took little action on the requests.|$|E
