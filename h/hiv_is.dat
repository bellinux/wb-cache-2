5|$|<b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> {{the cause}} of the {{spectrum}} of disease known as HIV/AIDS. <b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> a retrovirus that primarily infects components of the human immune system such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. It directly and indirectly destroys CD4+ T cells.|$|E
5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (<b>HIV)</b> <b>is</b> a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure {{of the immune system}} allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with <b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be 9 to 11years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, <b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.|$|E
5|$|Other {{antiviral}} {{drugs in}} use target {{different stages of}} the viral life cycle. <b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> dependent on a proteolytic enzyme called the HIV-1 protease for it to become fully infectious. There is a large class of drugs called protease inhibitors that inactivate this enzyme.|$|E

50|$|Discrimination {{based on}} <b>HIV</b> status <b>is</b> illegal, but HIV-positive people are highly stigmatized, with HIV-positive {{children}} being denied schooling, adults denied jobs, and abandonment by families common. Persons with <b>HIV</b> <b>are</b> often driven to suicide.|$|R
40|$|AIMS [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the stability of}} infectious HIV in clinical samples and the efficiency of isolating it from small volumes of whole blood. METHODS [...] Titres of infectious <b>HIV</b> <b>were</b> measured in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and plasma 2, 24, and 48 hours after peripheral blood had been collected from 10 HIV positive adult volunteers. Volumes of whole blood (1 ml to 5 microliters), collected from a further five volunteers, were used to determine the minimum volume from which <b>HIV</b> could <b>be</b> isolated. Infectious <b>HIV</b> <b>was</b> isolated by co-culture with phytohaemagglutinin stimulated umbilical cord mononuclear cells. RESULTS [...] Geometric mean titres of infectious <b>HIV</b> seemed to <b>be</b> more stable in peripheral blood mononuclear cells than in plasma. <b>HIV</b> <b>was</b> recovered from all 10 peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples during the 48 hours after sample collection, but from only four plasma samples. <b>HIV</b> could occasionally <b>be</b> isolated from 5 microliters of whole blood and reliably from 200 microliters. CONCLUSIONS [...] <b>HIV</b> can <b>be</b> isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma for up to 48 hours after sample collection. Isolation of HIV from small volumes of whole blood has applications for the diagnosis and management, of HIV positive children...|$|R
5|$|Other {{antiviral}} drugs target {{different stages}} of the viral life cycle. <b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> dependent on an enzyme called the HIV-1 protease for the virus to become infectious. There is a class of drugs called protease inhibitors, which bind to this enzyme and stop it from functioning.|$|E
5|$|Circumcision {{may be used}} {{to treat}} {{pathological}} phimosis, refractory balanoposthitis and chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The World Health Organization promotes circumcision to prevent female-to-male HIV transmission in countries with high rates of HIV. The International Antiviral Society-USA also suggests circumcision be discussed with MSM who engage in primarily insertive anal sex, especially in areas where <b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> common.|$|E
5|$|<b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> {{transmitted}} by three main routes: sexual contact, significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as vertical transmission). There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood. It {{is possible to}} be co-infected {{by more than one}} strain of HIV—a condition known as HIV superinfection.|$|E
50|$|American {{basketball}} player Magic Johnson announced on 7 November 1991 {{that he had}} HIV. This announcement raised awareness among black people that <b>HIV</b> <b>was</b> a problem and it also highlighted that <b>HIV</b> could <b>be</b> transmitted through heterosexual sex.|$|R

50|$|In Nigeria, {{there is}} a {{correlation}} between being HIV positive and domestic violence. Women who <b>are</b> diagnosed with <b>HIV</b> <b>are</b> {{at high risk for}} intimate partner violence. With <b>HIV,</b> there <b>is</b> also a tendency to stay in abusive relationships.|$|R
5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (<b>HIV)</b> <b>is</b> the virus that – when the infection is not treated – can cause AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Most virologists believe that HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century, and over 70 million individuals have been infected by the virus. By 2011, an estimated 35 million had died from AIDS, {{making it one of}} the most destructive epidemics in recorded history.|$|E
5|$|<b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> {{different}} in structure from other retroviruses. It is roughly spherical with {{a diameter of}} about 120nm, around 60times smaller than a red blood cell. It is composed of two copies of positive single-stranded RNA that codes for the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical capsid composed of 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24. The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7, and enzymes needed {{for the development of}} the virion such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease and integrase. A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the virion particle.|$|E
5|$|<b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another {{by a process}} of cell-to-cell spread. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E
40|$|Background. Hepatitis B virus (HBV), {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) and <b>HIV</b> <b>are</b> common blood-borne infections unevenly distributed across {{regions in}} Nigeria.

5|$|<b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> spread {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E
5|$|<b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> {{transmitted}} {{in about}} 93% of blood transfusions using infected blood. In developed countries {{the risk of}} acquiring HIV from a blood transfusion is extremely low (less than one in half a million) where improved donor selection and HIV screening is performed; for example, in the UK the risk is reported at one in five million and in the United States it was one in 1.5 million in 2008. In low income countries, only half of transfusions may be appropriately screened (as of 2008), and {{it is estimated that}} up to 15% of HIV infections in these areas come from transfusion of infected blood and blood products, representing between 5% and 10% of global infections. Although rare because of screening, it is possible to acquire HIV from organ and tissue transplantation.|$|E
5|$|<b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> {{typically}} {{transmitted through}} unprotected sex or intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, illicit drug users, and sex workers. For these reasons, and also because of fears of contagion, people living with HIV are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections. These efforts have been aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star Magic Johnson and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E

40|$|Cells {{infected}} with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (<b>HIV)</b> <b>were</b> selectively stained with peroxidase-coupled antibodies in a recently developed plaque assay for HIV. The numbers of plaques formed with the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III strain of <b>HIV</b> <b>were</b> exactly the same in stained (immunologically detectable) and unstained (visible) dishes. However, four times more plaques were visualized in stained dishes than in unstained dishes when the YU- 6 and acquired immune deficiency syndrome-associated retrovirus strains of <b>HIV</b> <b>were</b> used. Linear relationship was observed {{between the number of}} stained plaques and the virus concentrations in the titration of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III and YU- 6. The assay should be useful for the titration of HIV, especially for non- or weakly cytopathic strains of HIV...|$|R
5|$|In 2016 about 36.7 {{million people}} were living with HIV and it {{resulted}} in 1 million deaths. There were 300,000 fewer new HIV cases in 2016 than in 2015. Most of those infected live in sub-Saharan Africa. Between its discovery and 2014 AIDS has caused an estimated 39million deaths worldwide. HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemic—a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading. <b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> believed to have originated in west-central Africa during the late 19th or early 20th century. AIDS was first recognized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981 and its cause—HIV infection—was identified {{in the early part}} of the decade.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pasteur and Edward Jenner {{were the}} first to develop {{vaccines}} to protect against viral infections. The nature of viruses remained unknown until the invention of the electron microscope in the 1930s, when the science of virology gained momentum. In the 20th century many diseases both old and new were found to be caused by viruses. There were epidemics of poliomyelitis that were only controlled following the development of a vaccine in the 1950s. <b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> one of the most pathogenic new viruses to have emerged in centuries. Although scientific interest in them arose because of the diseases they cause, most viruses are beneficial. They drive evolution by transferring genes across species, play important roles in ecosystems and are essential to life.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO), {{which focuses}} on {{international}} health issues and disease eradication, is another of the UN's largest agencies. In 1980, the agency announced that the eradication of smallpox had been completed. In subsequent decades, WHO largely eradicated polio, river blindness, and leprosy. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), begun in 1996, co-ordinates the organization's response to the AIDS epidemic.

5|$|The {{initial period}} {{following}} the contraction of <b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome. Many individuals develop an influenza-like illness or a mononucleosis-like illness 2–4 weeks post exposure {{while others have}} no significant symptoms. Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include fever, large tender lymph nodes, throat inflammation, a rash, headache, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals. The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents itself on the trunk and is maculopapular, classically. Some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or diarrhea may occur. Neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or Guillain–Barré syndrome also occurs. The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks.|$|E
5|$|The life {{expectancy}} in Bahrain is 73 {{for males and}} 76 for females. Compared to many countries in the region, the prevalence of AIDS and <b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> relatively low. Malaria and tuberculosis (TB) do not constitute major problems in Bahrain as neither disease is indigenous to the country. As a result, cases of malaria and TB have declined in recent decades with cases of contractions amongst Bahraini nationals becoming rare.

5|$|The most {{frequent}} {{mode of transmission}} of <b>HIV</b> <b>is</b> through sexual contact with an infected person. Globally, the most common mode of HIV transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex; however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries. As of 2014, most HIV transmission in the United States occurred among men who had sex with men (83% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 67% of total new diagnoses). In the US, gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men. About 15% of gay and bisexual men have HIV while 28 percent of transgender women test positive in the US.|$|E
