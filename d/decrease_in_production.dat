25|$|In general, Aklan is {{sufficient}} in meat and other livestock and poultry products, {{though in the}} inventory of livestock and poultry in the year 2000, hog and chicken had a decrease in population from 114,890 heads of hogs and 886,597 heads of chickens in 1999 to 95,950 heads of hogs and 782,820 heads of chicken in the 2000. The <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> were attributed to the following factors: high cost of feeds, feed supplements and biologics; livestock and poultry diseases; increasing price of chicks; and, high cost of labor.|$|E
25|$|Though labor-intensive, a suka qullu {{produces}} impressive yields. While traditional {{agriculture in}} the region typically yields 2.4 metric tons of potatoes per hectare, and modern agriculture (with artificial fertilizers and pesticides) yields about 14.5 metric tons per hectare, suka qullu agriculture yields an average of 21 tons per hectare. Modern agricultural researchers have re-introduced the technique of suka qullu. Significantly, the experimental suka qullu fields recreated in the 1980s by University of ChicagoÂ´s Alan Kolata and Oswaldo Rivera suffered only a 10% <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> following a 1988 freeze that killed 70-90% {{of the rest of}} the region's production. Development by the Tiwanaku of this kind of protection against killing frosts in an agrarian civilization was invaluable to their growth.|$|E

25|$|Milan had {{a strong}} {{industrial}} and economic production after the war, however, it fell slightly in the late 1990s and early 2000s, especially with the tangentopoli political scandal. However, from 2004 onwards, economic growth started to increase again, {{with an average of}} 1%, below Lombardy (whose growth rate was 4.6%) and the Italy's 2004 6% average, and a significant reduced production in some industries: footwear (-11.4%), textiles (-6.1%) and clothing (-5%). The bulk of the plastic (-2%), chemicals (-1.8%) and mechanics (-1.6%) industries show a downward trend. Publishing production decreased by -2.6%, while the wood-processing industry production decreased by -1.2%. In contrast, despite an industrial <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>production,</b> Milan has had a rapid and strong growth in the tertiary and quaternary sectors, with logistics and transport (+6.8%) and food (+1.7%). Milan also has an important role in book production and publishing. It is the most important city in the nation for publishing.|$|E

50|$|For pure {{explosive}} damage, high burn {{rates or}} detonation speeds (and accompanying brisance) are generally preferable, but in guns and especially cannons, slower-burning powder decreases firing stresses.

Further modifications of its burning rate were achieved by shaping the powder grains into prismatic shapes, typically single-perforated hexagonal or octagonal prisms.|$|R
40|$|Summary. Injection of an ovulation-blocking dose of {{pentobarbitone}} sodium {{given in}} the early afternoon of pro-oestrus <b>in</b> rats <b>decreased</b> follicular oestradiol <b>production</b> <b>in</b> vitro the next day (2 =. 2 =+-=. 1 ng/ 4 h/follicle in pro-oestrous rats, 0 =. 9 =+-=. 4 ng/ 4 h/ follicle in pentobarbitone-treated rats). Pentobarbitone, given 1 day earlier (at di-oestrus II), prevented the increase <b>in</b> oestradiol <b>production</b> that normally occurs between di-oestrus II and pro-oestrus. Injection of a subovulatory amount of hCG (0 =. i. u.) given after pentobarbitone injection inhibited the <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> follicular oestradiol <b>production</b> induced by pentobarbitone. The pentobarbitone-induced <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> oestradiol <b>production</b> was also prevented by bromocriptine (1 mg) given at di-oestrus II (15 : 00 h) and pro-oestrus (09 : 00 h). Bromocriptine is an effective inhibitor of prolactin secretion and this suggests therefore that the <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> follicular oestradiol <b>production</b> after pentobarbitone is due to the preovulatory surge of prolactin. However, pretreatment with bromocriptine also inhi-bited the effect of pentobarbitone on oestradiol production when pentobarbitone was given at di-oestrus II. Moreover, when ergocornine (another inhibitor of prolactin secretion) was used instead of pentobarbitone to block ovulation, follicular oestradiol production was also decreased the next day. In contrast to bromocriptine, ergocornine was not able to prevent the pentobarbitone-induced <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> follicular oestradiol <b>production.</b> These results indicate that the <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> follicular oestradiol <b>production</b> after pentobarbitone injection is due to inhibition of the serum concentrations of LH rather than the preovulatory surge of prolactin. How bromocriptine (but not ergocornine) prevents the pentobarbitone-induced <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> oestradiol <b>production</b> is not clear...|$|R

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{possible}} limitations to implementing cellular manufacturing. Some argue that cellular manufacturing can lead to a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> flexibility. Cells are typically designed to maintain a specific flow volume of parts being produced. Should the demand or necessary quantity decrease, the cells may have to be realigned to match the new requirements, which is a costly operation, and one not typically required in other manufacturing setups.|$|E
50|$|Gastric lipase can {{partially}} {{compensate for}} the <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> of pancreatic lipase associated with pancreatic dysfunction, giving some means for the body to digest lipids. A limitation of acidic lipases is that they remove only one fatty acid from each triacylglycerol.

This leaves the acidic lipases less efficient than alkaline lipases.|$|E
