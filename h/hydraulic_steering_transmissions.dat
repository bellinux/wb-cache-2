40|$|The main {{target of}} a {{steering}} system is that the driver can change vehicle trajectory {{in accordance with the}} desired direction.  Power steering has become a standard feature in automobile.   It provides assisting power when the driver turns the steering wheel. The well-known power <b>steering</b> types include; <b>Hydraulic</b> Power <b>Steering</b> (HPS), Electro - <b>Hydraulic</b> Power <b>Steering</b> (EHPS), and Electric Power Steering (EPS). EHPS or EPS uses an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) which is specific for each vehicle. The ECU should be able to regulate power of electric motor to provide corresponding assisting power for the steering wheel. Therefore ECU requires input signals, one of which is vehicle wheel angle that can be indicated from the vehicle steering wheel angle. Incremental type of Rotary Encoder (RE) is used in steering angle sensor on a minibus. RE specification used was 60 pulses per rotation and the minibus <b>steering</b> <b>transmission</b> specification is 3. 5 round of right wheel off angle to the left wheel off angle. So we get the RE angular resolution 6 ºper pulse and 105 number of pulses to half of the <b>steering</b> <b>transmission</b> ratio. Repeatability then tested against to a steering angle counter module. Testing is done with a test cycle consisting of 3 repetitions: condition center of the steering wheel, the steering wheel is turned to full right, then to the full left, then back to the right up to the steering wheel center. The results obtained 2 pulses deviation, or equivalent to 12 º of steering angle. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} energy saving power {{steering}} system, which was named as KEEPS (Kayaba Electronic Controlled Energy Saving Power Steering). In a conventional <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>steering</b> system, the <b>hydraulic</b> pump always supplies enough quantity {{of oil to}} the hydraulic circuit. This extra oil flow increases driving torque of the pump, thus the <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>steering</b> system wastes energy. On the other hand, KEEPS can control oil flow electrically {{in accordance with the}} condition of a vehicle. In the measurement test for energy consumption of the power steering system with the actual vehicle on test courses, KEEPS got 48 % less at city mode, 41 % less at highway mode and 39 % less at country mode compared with the conventional <b>hydraulic</b> <b>steering</b> system...|$|R
