The area in which an alpine glacier forms is called a cirque (corrie or cwm), a typically armchair-shaped geological feature, which collects snow and where the snowpack compacts {{under the weight of}} successive layers of accumulating snow, forming névé. Further crushing of the individual snow crystals and reduction of <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> in the snow turns it into 'glacial ice'. This glacial ice will fill the cirque until it 'overflows' through a geological weakness or vacancy, such as the gap between two mountains.

[...] On steeper slopes, this can occur with as little as 15m (50ft) of snow-ice.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Wrought {{aluminium}} alloys {{are prone to}} hot tearing when cast into near-net shapes. This problem can be overcome by the novel casting technique of rheo-processing combined with high pressure die casting. An industrial engine mounting bracket is produced by rheo-process commercial 7075 with the patented CSIR-RCS and subsequent high pressure die casting. Section thickness changes and constraining geometry make this a difficult component to rheocast. X-ray radiography is used to evaluate hot tearing over the component and is correlated to piston injection shot profile velocities. Gross hot tearing is significantly reduced by a higher injection velocity but turbulent flow <b>entraps</b> <b>air.</b> Faster injection allows more time for flow before final solidification...|$|R

Different kind of chemical admixtures were considered belonging to naphthalene (NSF) and polycarboxylate-based families. Five lots of six different cements widely spread in Italy were considered. Mortars and concretes were manufactured by varying superplasticizer dosage to achieve fixed workability {{at the end of}} mixing. Flow retention up to sixty minutes and tendency to <b>entrap</b> <b>air</b> in the mortars and concrete were measured to evaluate performances in terms of water reduction and workability loss of each chemical admixture.

30|$|It {{can also}} be {{observed}} that by increasing the MWCNTs content, there is an increase followed by {{a decrease in the}} mechanical properties. This trend can be clearly observed in Tables  3 and 6, and the inset of Fig.  6 for the impact energy, flexure strength, and Young’s modulus, respectively. This trend is a result of two counteracting factors. First, with relatively small amounts of MWCNTs (e.g. 0.5  wt% and below), there is insufficient amount of CNTs that can introduce significant effect on the mechanical properties of polymer concretes. As the amount of CNTs increases, the improvements increase. On the other hand, the inefficiency of 1.5  wt% MWCNTs content {{can be attributed to the}} reduction of PC flowability at high content of MWCNTs. While the effect of MWCNTs on PC flowability was limited in the case of 0.5 and 1.0  wt% the addition of 1.5  wt% MWCNTs reduced the flowability significantly. This reduction in PC flowability might result in <b>entrapping</b> <b>air</b> that reduces the mechanical properties of PC with 1.5  wt% MWCNTs.|$|R

40|$|The roof {{inside a}} ship tank {{is exposed to}} {{different}} impact load scenarios during sloshing at high fillings. This work is a detailed study of the load exerted near the tank corner when the incoming wave <b>entraps</b> an <b>air</b> pocket. This air pocket is compressed by the wave. After this initial compression the pressure inside the air pocket starts to oscillate qualitatively as a damped mass-spring system. A similar type of impact occurs when a breaking shallow water wave <b>entraps</b> an <b>air</b> pocket on a sea wall. Different sources for the decay mechanism has been proposed such as air leakage.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this research project was to investigate phenomena involved in the filling of die cavities with molten alloy in the cold chamber die-casting process. It has long been recognized that the filling pattern of molten metal entering a die cavity influences the quality of die-cast parts. Filling pattern may {{be described as the}} progression of molten metal filling the die cavity geometry as a function of time. The location, size and geometric configuration of points of metal entry (gates), as well as the geometry of the casting cavity itself, have great influence on filling patterns. Knowledge of the anticipated filling patterns in die-castings is important for designers. Locating gates to avoid undesirable flow patterns that may <b>entrap</b> <b>air</b> in the casting is critical to casting quality - as locating vents to allow air to escape from the cavity (last places to fill). Casting quality attributes that are commonly flow related are non-fills, poor surface finish, internal porosity due to trapped air, cold shuts, cold laps, flow lines, casting skin delamination (flaking), and blistering during thermal treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{process by}} which a liquid jet falling into a liquid pool entrains air is studied {{experimentally}} and theoretically. It is shown that, provided the nozzle from which the jet issues is properly contoured, an undisturbed jet does not <b>entrap</b> <b>air</b> even at relatively high Reynolds numbers. When surface disturbances are generated on the jet by a rapid increase of the liquid flow rate, on the other hand, large air cavities are formed. Their collapse under the action of gravity causes the entrapment of bubbles in the liquid. This sequence of events is recorded with a CCD and a high-speed camera. A boundary-integral method is used to simulate the process numerically with results in good agreement with the observations. An unexpected nding is {{that the role of}} the jet is not simply that of conveying the disturbance to the pool surface. Rather, both the observed energy budget and the simulations imply the presence of a mechanism by which part of the jet energy is used in creating the cavity. A hypothesis on the nature of this mechanism is presented...|$|R

50|$|A gluten matrix {{is formed}} when the {{proteins}} glutenin and gliadin, found in wheat flour, are mixed {{in the presence}} of water. When the batter is agitated, these two proteins form cross-links, disulfide bonds, ionic bonds, and hydrogen bonds. The matrix that forms is strong and very flexible. Although no water is added to the batter, the gluten reacts with the water found in egg whites. Since air has already been entrapped in the foam, the flour proteins can only coat the already <b>entrapped</b> <b>air.</b> This helps to strengthen the cell walls and batter during baking or any other handling. This is beneficial because the meringue on its own is weak, cannot expand in heat, and does not have any elasticity normally expected in cakes.|$|E
30|$|The Pt {{composite}} materials have gained much attention {{due to their}} good multifunctions [16, 17]. Pt NPs-chitosan composite particles have been extensively studied {{over the last decade}} [18, 19], and Pt NPs-chitosan composite bubbles {{are one of the most}} emerging and intriguing topics [20, 21]. Bubble particles have import features <b>entrapping</b> <b>air</b> bubbles inside. Due to their low density, bubble particles can float on liquid surface for specific applications. They can also be applied as novel vehicles for ultrasound-mediated imaging and targeted drug delivery followed by burst release [22 – 27]. Besides, bubble particles can be utilized as absorbers to facilitate adsorption of substrates due to a high-surface area. Pt NPs-chitosan composite bubbles can be applied in controlled release and tissue engineering; however, chitosan carrier substrates will disintegrate and dissolve in acid solution such as gastric juices. Therefore, Pt NPs-chitosan composite bubbles are limited in acidic condition. Fortunately, alginate polymer provides a solution to overcome this problem. Alginate polymer has a dense structure to pass the acid solution. To our best knowledge, Pt NPs-alginate composite (Pt NPs@alginate) bubbles are seldom reported in literatures, and they can provide applications for wide pH ranges.|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a coating device for application of coating material {{to the surface of}} a web or a flexible substrate. The coating device contains a pressurized channel where a flowing stream of the coating liquid first comes into contact with the substrate. The coating liquid enters the channel at the upstream side and wets the substrate as it flows {{in the same direction as}} the substrate. A doctor element is positioned at the downstream side of the channel where the excess coating in the channel follows the contour of the boundary formed by the doctor element and leaves the channel. The geometry of the streamlined boundaries of the coating device eliminate the formation of recirculating eddies or vortices. The elimination of vortices eliminates flow instability due to centrifugal forces and removes harmful pressure fluctuations which could result in coat-weight nonuniformities. The elimination of recirculating eddies or vortices also removes the possibility of <b>entrapping</b> <b>air</b> pockets or air bubbles in the core of the vortices which could reach the blade gap and could result in coat-weight nonuniformities and wet streaks.

A detailed characterisation of five gluten-free starches (corn, wheat, rice, tapioca, potato) was performed in this study.

The morphological characterisation, evaluated using scanning electron microscopy, revealed some similarities among the starches, which could {{be linked to the}} baking performance of the breads. Moreover, the lipid content, though representing one of the minor components in starch, was found to have an influence on pasting, bread making, and staling. Quality differences in cereal root and tuber starch based breads were observed. However, under the baking conditions used, gluten-free rendered wheat starch performed best, followed by potato starch, in terms of loaf volume and cell structure. Tapioca starch and rice starch based breads were not further analysed, due to an inferior baking performance.

50|$|Pregelatinized starch may {{be added}} to {{increase}} the rate of starch gelatinization. One method of pregelatinization starts by heating a mixture of starch and water until a gel forms. The gel may be placed on a heated roll in a thin layer in order to dry it. Once all the water has been removed, a starch cake is left on the roll. The cake is then scraped off and pulverized to form a powder. When the pregelatinized starch powder is subjected to water, a gel forms. The pregelatinized starch increases water adsorption. This in turn increases the batter viscosity and helps retain the <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> while the batter is prepared and as it starts to bake.

50|$|The {{acoustic}} suspension woofer {{provided an}} elegant {{solution to the}} age-old problem of bass distortion in loudspeakers caused by non-linear, mechanical suspensions in conventional loudspeakers. The acoustic suspension woofer (sometimes known as “air suspension”) used the elasticity of air within a small, sealed enclosure of about 1.7 cuft L to provide the restoring force for the woofer cone. The <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> of the sealed-loudspeaker enclosure -— unlike the mechanical springs of conventional speakers—provided an (almost) linear spring for the woofer's diaphragm, enabling it to {{move back and forth}} great distances (“excursion”) in a linear fashion, a requirement in the reproduction of deep bass tones. The disadvantage of this arrangement is low efficiency; since the restoring force is large with a large woofer in a small cabinet, the cone must be massive to keep the resonant frequency in the required low bass region. The AR-1s were about a factor of 10 less efficient than other (physically much larger) existing speakers with the same bass response, but since higher power amplifiers were becoming available about the same time, this was a reasonable trade-off to get good bass response from a relatively small speaker.|$|E

When applied to a ship hull, the coating would allow the boat to float on an air-layer; reducing energy consumption and emissions.

The Salvinia effect was discovered by the biologist and botanist Wilhelm Barthlott (University of Bonn) and his colleagues and has been investigated on several plants and animals since 2002.

The best biological models are the floating ferns (Salvinia) with highly sophisticated hierarchically structured hairy surfaces, and the back swimmers (e.g.Notonecta) with a complex double structure of hairs (setae) and microvilli (microtrichia).

The replacement of gluten in cereal-based products remains a challenge for scientists, due to its unique role in network formation, which <b>entraps</b> <b>air</b> bubbles. When gluten is removed from a flour, starch is the main component left. Starch is used as gelling, thickening, adhesion, moisture-retention, stabilizing, film forming, texturizing and anti-staling ingredient.

Gordon had initially described the phenomenon of intraspinal air. The term pneumorrhachis was used for the first time by Newbold et al. The two subtypes of pneumorrhachis, which includes epidural or subarachnoid, are difficult to distinguish even with CT scanning. However, the presence of pneumocephalus goes more in favor of subarachnoid subtype. Goh and Yeo in their study have reported that the epidural pneumorrhachis is self-limited, whereas the more common subarachnoid pneumorrhachis type may be complicated by tension pneumocephalus and meningitis. Traumatic subarachnoid pneumorrhachis is almost always secondary to major trauma and is a marker of a severe injury. The pathophysiology described for it states that the penetrated air, which had {{led to the formation of}} pneumocephalus might have been forced caudally due to the raised intracranial pressure as a consequence of severe brain injury and patient's horizontal position allowing the <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> to pass through the foramen magnum into the spinal canal.

5000|$|Apply {{investment}} materials: The ceramic mould, {{known as}} the investment, is produced by repeating a series of steps—coating, stuccoing, and hardening—until a desired thickness is achieved. Coating involves dipping a pattern cluster into a slurry of fine refractory material and then draining to create a uniform surface coating. Fine materials are used in this first step, also called a prime coat, to preserve fine details from the mould. Stuccoing applies coarse ceramic particles by dipping patterns into a fluidised bed, placing it in a rainfall-sander, or by applying materials by hand. Hardening allows coatings to cure. These steps are repeated until the investment reaches its required thickness—usually 5 to 15 mm. Investment moulds are left to dry completely, which can take 16 to 48 hours. Drying can be accelerated by applying a vacuum or minimizing environmental humidity. Investment moulds can also be created by placing the pattern clusters into a flask and then pouring liquid investment material from above. The flask is then vibrated to allow <b>entrapped</b> <b>air</b> to escape and help the investment material fill any small voids. [...] Common refractory materials used to create the investments are: silica, zircon, various aluminium silicates, and alumina. Silica is usually used in the fused silica form, but sometimes quartz is used because it is less expensive. Aluminium silicates are a mixture of alumina and silica, where commonly used mixtures have an alumina content from 42 to 72%; at 72% alumina the compound is known as mullite. During the primary coat(s), zircon-based refractories are commonly used, because zirconium {{is less likely to}} react with the molten metal. Prior to silica, a mixture of plaster and ground up old molds (chamotte) was used. The binders used to hold the refractory material in place include: ethyl silicate (alcohol-based and chemically set), colloidal silica (water-based, also known as silica sol, set by drying), sodium silicate, and a hybrid of these controlled for pH and viscosity.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThin liquid films, such as soap bubbles, {{have been}} studied {{extensively}} {{for over a century}} because they are easily formed and mediate a wide range of transport processes in physics, chemistry and engineering. When a bubble on a liquid-gas or solid-gas interface (referred to herein as an interfacial bubble) ruptures, the general expectation is that the bubble vanishes. More precisely, the ruptured thin film is expected to retract rapidly until it becomes part of the interface, an event that typically occurs within milliseconds. The assumption that ruptured bubbles vanish is central to theories on foam evolution and relevant to health and climate because bubble rupture is a source for aerosol droplets. Here we show that for a large range of fluid parameters, interfacial bubbles can create numerous small bubbles when they rupture, rather than vanishing. We demonstrate, both experimentally and numerically, that the curved film of the ruptured bubble can fold and <b>entrap</b> <b>air</b> as it retracts. The resulting toroidal geometry of the trapped air is unstable, leading {{to the creation of a}} ring of smaller bubbles.

Suberhydrophobicity enhances the mobility of droplets on lotus leaves for self-cleaning purposes, so-called lotus effect. Amongst other applications, superhydrophobicity could be used to design slippery surfaces with minimal skin-friction drag for energy conservation. Another kind of slippery coatings is the recently invented slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS), which are one type of omniphobic surfaces. Certain plants such as the carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher inspired SLIPS. Their interior surfaces have microstructural roughness, which can lock in place an infused lubricating liquid. The lubricant is then utilized as a repellent surface for other liquids such as water, blood, crude oil, and alcohol.

The proper functioning of these microfluidic devices requires displacing accurate volumes of liquids with precise flow rates.

The capillary pumps comprise microstructures of various shapes with dimensions from 15 – 250 mm, which are positioned in the capillary pumps to encode a desired capillary pressure. The capillary pumps are designed to have a small flow resistance and are preceded by a constricted microchannel, which acts as a flow resistance.
