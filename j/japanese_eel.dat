2500|$|The largest {{threats to}} the Yangtze native fish are {{overfishing}} and habitat loss (such as building of dams and land reclamation), but pollution, destructive fishing practices (such as fishing with dynamite or poison) and introduced species also cause problems. About [...] of the total freshwater fisheries in China are in the Yangtze Basin, but a drastic decline in size of several important species has been recorded, as highlighted by data from lakes in the river basin. Some experts recommend a 10-year fishing moratorium to allow the remaining populations to recover. Dams present another serious problem, as several species in the river perform breeding migrations {{and most of these}} are non-jumpers, meaning that normal fish ladders designed for salmon are ineffective. For example, the Gezhouba Dam blocked the migration of the paddlerfish and two sturgeon, while also effectively splitting the Chinese high fin banded shark population into two and causing the extirpation of the Yangtze population of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>eel.</b> In an attempt of minimizing the effect of the dams, the Three Gorges Dam has released water to mimic the (pre-dam) natural flooding and trigger the breeding of carp species downstream. In addition to dams already built in the Yangtze basin, several large dams are planned and these may present further problems for the native fauna.|$|E

40|$|The oceanic {{migration}} of silver <b>Japanese</b> <b>eels</b> starts from their continental growth habitats in East Asia and {{ends at the}} spawning area near the West Mariana Ridge seamount chain. However, the actual migration routes remain unknown. In this study, we examined the possible oceanic migration routes and strategies of silver <b>Japanese</b> <b>eels</b> using a particle tracking method in which virtual eels (v-eels) were programmed to move vertically and horizontally in an ocean circulation model (Japan Coastal Ocean Predictability Experiment 2, JCOPE 2). Four horizontal swimming strategies were tested: random heading, true navigation (readjusted heading), orientation toward the spawning area (fixed heading), and swimming against the Kuroshio. We found that all strategies, except random swimming, allowed v-eels swimming at 0. 65 m s- 1 to reach the spawning area within eight months after their departure from the south coast of Japan (end of the spawning season). The estimated minimum swimming speed required to reach the area spawning within eight months was 0. 1 m s- 1 for true navigation, 0. 12 m s- 1 for constant compass heading, and 0. 35 m s- 1 for swimming against the Kuroshio. The lowest swimming speed estimated from tracked <b>Japanese</b> <b>eels</b> at sea was 0. 03 m. s- 1, which would {{not allow them to}} reach the spawning area within eight months, through any of the tested orientation strategies. Our numerical experiments also showed that ocean circulation significantly affected the {{migration of}} Japanese v-eels. A strong Kuroshio could advect v-eels further eastward. In addition, western Pacific ocean currents accelerated the migration of navigating v-eels. The migration duration was shortened in years with a stronger southward flow, contributed by a stronger recirculation south of Japan, an enhanced subtropical gyre, or a higher southward Kuroshio velocity...|$|R

Their silvering stage, condition factor, three internal (gonad-somatic index: GSI, hepato-somatic index and gut index) and two morphometric (fin index and eye index) indices were calculated. The overall sex ratio tended to be female (61 %), but the sex ratio differed among years and months. Silver eels of S 1 stage (early silver) were predominant than S 2 (late silver) for both sexes (female: 67 %, male: 77 %). Female eels attained to larger size (mean: 659. 3 mm) and older age (9. 9 years) than males (527. 7 mm and 8. 3 years).

50|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>eel</b> {{and other}} anguillid eels live in fresh water and {{estuaries}} where they feed and grow as yellow eels {{for a number}} of years before they begin to mature and become silver eels. The silver eels then migrate out of fresh water into the ocean and start their long journey to their spawning area. Adult Japanese eels migrate thousands of kilometers from freshwater rivers in East Asia to their spawning area without feeding. The spawning area of this species was discovered in 1991 by collecting small leptocephali about 10 mm in size, and then in 2005 the same team of Japanese scientists at the University of Tokyo found a more precise location of spawning based on genetically identified specimens of newly hatched preleptocephali only 2 to 5 days old in a small area near the Suruga Seamount to the west of the Mariana Islands (14-17° N, 142-143° E). In more recent years, more preleptocephali have been collected, and even <b>Japanese</b> <b>eel</b> eggs have been collected and genetically identified at sea on the research vessel. The collections of eggs and recently hatched larvae have been made along the western side of the seamount chain of the West Mariana Ridge. Furthermore, mature adults of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>eel</b> and giant mottled eel were captured using large midwater trawls in 2008 by Japanese scientists at the Fisheries Research Agency. The adults of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>eel</b> appear to spawn in the upper few hundred meters of the ocean based on the recent catches of their spawning adults, eggs, and newly hatched larvae. The timing of catches of eggs and larvae and the ages of larger larvae have shown that Japanese eels only spawn during the few days just before the new moon period of each month of their spawning season.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>eel</b> (Anguilla japonica; Japanese: 日本鰻 nihon'unagi) is {{a species}} of anguillid eel found in Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, and Vietnam, {{as well as the}} {{northern}} Philippines.

30|$|For marine species, {{dispersal}} {{during the}} larval phase is often important in shaping population genetic structure, and ocean currents {{play an important}} role in larval transport (Sponaugle et al. 2002; Fisher 2005). The migration distances for temperate eels such as the Atlantic and <b>Japanese</b> <b>eels</b> show thousands of km, while those of the tropical eels have been found local-short distance migration less than 100  km (Arai 2014 b). The larval dispersal times for temperate eels such as the Atlantic, Australian, Japanese and New Zealand eels were 1 to 5  months longer than those of the tropical species (Arai et al. 2001). The time and distance required for dispersing larvae and migrating adults might be longer in temperate eels. The results suggest that higher genetic differentiation might be occurred in temperate species than that of tropical species.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>eel</b> population, {{along with}} anguillid eel populations worldwide, have {{declined}} drastically in recent years, presumably {{due to a}} combination of overfishing and habitat loss or changing water conditions in the ocean interfering with spawning and the transport of their leptocephali. In the case of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>eel,</b> spawning is likely affected by the north-south shifts of a salinity front created by an area of low-salinity waters resulting from tropical rainfall. The front is thought to be detected by the adult spawning eels and to affect the latitudes at which they spawn. A northward shift in the front that occurred over the past 30 years appears to have occurred, which could cause more larvae to be retained in eddies offshore in the region east of Taiwan, and southward shifts in the salinity front have been observed in recent years that could increase southward transport into the Mindanao Current that flows into the Celebes Sea. These types of unfavorable larval transport are thought to reduce the recruitment success of the Japanese eels that reach river mouths as glass eels.|$|E

40|$|Hyaluronan (HA) is {{a linear}} {{polysaccharide}} of {{high molecular weight}} that exists {{as a component of}} the extracellular matrix. The larvae (leptocephali) of the <b>Japanese</b> conger <b>eel</b> (Anguilliformes: Conger myriaster) have high levels of hyaluronan (HA) which is thought to help control body water content. We isolated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) from <b>Japanese</b> conger <b>eel</b> leptocephali and measured the changes in tissue HA content during metamorphosis. HA content decreased during metamorphosis. In contrast, neutral sugar content increased during metamorphosis.
