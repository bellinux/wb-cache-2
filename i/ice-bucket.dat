The lamps shed a diffused light, {{and one of them is}} slightly odd in construction, because it is for knocking over presently in order to let the lady escape unobserved. Through this room moves occasionally the man's Man, sleek, imperturbable, announcing the lady, the lady's husband, the woman friend who is to save them; he says little, but is responsible for all the arrangements going right; before the curtain rises he may be conceived trying the lamp and making sure that the lady will not stick in the door.|$|E

40|$|The {{social media}} {{phenomenon}} of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) <b>Ice-Bucket</b> Challenge attracted more than 3 million donors to upload 1. 2 million Facebook videos and give more than US$ 115 million. In fundraising terms, it was a social media anomaly. This article applies Kent and Taylor’s dialogic theoretical component of propinquity (immediacy of presence, temporal flow and engagement) to explore how the ALS <b>Ice-Bucket</b> Challenge leveraged a propinquital loop (and subsequent chain), to enable participants to move between social media and offline spaces, while creating relational elasticity between participant and cause. Propinquity and its function within a social media context {{is an area of}} research that has not yet been greatly considered in the literature, yet may have the potential of informing public relations professionals from the non-profit sector and more widely about social media practice...|$|E
40|$|Measurement {{capabilities}} {{are essential for}} a variety of network applications, such as load balancing, routing, fairness and intrusion detection. These capabilities require large counter arrays in order to monitor the traffic of all network flows. While commodity SRAM memories are capable of operating at line speed, they are too small to accommodate large counter arrays. Previous works suggested estimators, which trade precision for reduced space. However, in order to accurately estimate the largest counter, these methods compromise the accuracy of the smaller counters. In this work, we present a closed form representation of the optimal estimation function. We then introduce Independent Counter Estimation Buckets (<b>ICE-Buckets),</b> a novel algorithm that improves estimation accuracy for all counters. This is achieved by separating the flows to buckets and configuring the optimal estimation function according to each bucket's counter scale. We prove a tighter upper bound on the relative error and demonstrate an accuracy improvement of up to 57 times on real Internet packet traces...|$|R

The French {{etiquette}} {{for serving}} food was established and spread {{during the first}} half of the 18 th Century in a way that parallels the development of the art of gardens. The rules linked to drink are one of the most surprising aspects of French serving etiquette. It had long been established that no drinker should put his glass on the table, and the habit of cooling all drinks and glasses with ice gave rise to a whole range of instruments : <b>ice-buckets</b> or coolers, divided into three groups according to size, some of the most beautiful specimens of which have survived. For those wines which were never served on the table, special buckets called "cuvettes" were used; to cool several glasses at once, glass racks or crenellated buckets were apparently developed in the Sèvres factory.

40|$|This article {{examines}} social media challenges {{that emerged in}} 2013, focusing on Neknomination, the <b>Ice-Bucket</b> Challenge and SmearForSmear. We understand them as ‘viral challenge memes’ that manifest a set of consistent features, making them a distinctive phenomenon within digital culture. Drawing upon Tarde’s concept of the imitative-encounter, we highlight three central features: their basis in social belonging and participation; the role of prestigious people and groups in determining the spread of challenges; and the distinctive techniques of self-presentation undertaken by participants. Based upon focus group interviews, surveys and visual analysis we suggest that viral challenge memes are social practices that diffuse in a wave-like fashion. Negotiating tensions between the social and individual, imitation and innovation, continuity and change, viral challenge memes are best thought of as creative practices, rather than sheep-like acts of conformity, and affirm the usefulness of analytical principles drawn from Tarde...|$|E
