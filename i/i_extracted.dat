When vibrissa follicles were cultured in the presence of <b>I.</b> sinicola <b>extract</b> for 21 days, <b>I.</b> sinicola <b>extract</b> increased hair-fiber length. After topical application of <b>I.</b> sinicola <b>extract</b> onto the back of C 57 BL/ 6 mice, anagen progression of the hair shaft was induced.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} hepatoprotective effect of Ipomoea carnea (<b>I.</b> carnea) <b>extract</b> against antitubercular drug-induced liver {{toxicity}} in experimental animals. Methods: <b>I.</b> carnea <b>extracts</b> (125, 250 and 500 mg/kg, p. o. body weight) were administered daily for 35 d in experimental animals. Liver toxicity was induced by combination of three antitubercular drugs (isoniazid 7. 5 mg/kg, rifampicin 10 mg/kg and pyrazinamide 35 mg/kg) given orally as suspension for 35 d in rats. Treatment groups received <b>I.</b> carnea <b>extracts</b> along with antitubercular drugs. The hepatoprotective activity {{was assessed using}} various biochemical parameters like aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatise and total bilirubin. Meanwhile, in-vivo antioxidant activities as lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase were measured in rat liver homogenate along with ATPase and G- 6 -Pase. The biochemical observations were supplemented by histopathological examination. Results: Obtained results demonstrated that treatment with <b>I.</b> carnea <b>extracts</b> significantly (P< 0. 05 -P< 0. 001) and dose-dependently prevented drug induced increase in serum levels of hepatic enzymes. Furthermore, <b>I.</b> carnea <b>extracts</b> significantly (up to P< 0. 001) reduced the lipid peroxidation in the liver tissue and restored activities of defence antioxidant enzymes, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase and catalase towards normal levels. Histopathology of the liver tissue showed that <b>I.</b> carnea <b>extracts</b> attenuated the hepatocellular necrosis, massive fatty changes and led to reduction in inflammatory cells infiltration. Conclusions: The {{results of this study}} strongly indicate the protective effect of <b>I.</b> carnea <b>extracts</b> against liver injury, which may be attributed to its hepatoprotective activity, and there by scientifically support its traditional use...|$|R
