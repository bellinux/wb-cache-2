TiO 2 coatings were sintered in 450 o C for 1 hr. The phase transformation of TiO 2 films was considered using XRD. Morphology, average particle size and the thickness of TiO 2 films was analyzed using FESEM microscope. The photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 films was evaluated by the degradation of aqueous methyl orange (MO) under UV irradiation. The ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer was used to record the changes of the adsorbancy of the MO solution. Hydrophilicity of TiO 2 films was determined by measuring contact angle of water droplet with the surface of TiO 2 films. Results represented that decomposition rate of MO solution by TiO 2 films enhances from 6. 5 % to 31 % by increasing applied voltage of deposition from 10 to 60 V and from 5 % to 40 % by increasing UV illumination duration from 1 to 5 hours.

Shapes of Pd NPs in the colloid solution were monitored by a {{transmission electron microscope}} and/or by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The Pd NPs were spherical, 7 nm in diameter, with 10 % dispersion. Optical absorption peak due to surface-plasmon-resonance of Pd NPs in isooctane at 280 nm wave length was monitored by a split-beam photospectrometer. Pure chemicals and polished n-type InP and GaN (doping levels 2.5 × 1015 and 2 × 1017 cm- 1) crystal wafers were purchased from recognized commercial companies as stated previously [6]. Each crystal wafer of 10 × 10 mm 2 size was first shortly treated in boiled methanol and then the unpolished side was procured with the all-area ohmic contact at room temperature by rubbing liquid solution of tin in gallium with a tin rod and a cotton-wool swab. <b>Electrophoretic</b> <b>depositions</b> (EPD) of Pd NPs onto polished InP or GaN were performed from the colloid solution by applying an electric field of 2, 000 V/cm for 50 ms, with a 100 -ms period for sufficient time.

As aggregation {{is a problem}} in NP immobilization, developing an in situ method to detect aggregation is vital to characterise such modified electrodes. We present chronoamperometry as a method for detection of NP surface aggregation and semi-quantitative sizing of the formed aggregates, based on the diffusion limited current measured at PBEs as compared with the values calculated numerically for different blocking feature sizes. In contrast to voltammetry, no approximations on electrode kinetics are needed, making chronoamperometry a more general and reliable method. Sizing is shown for two modification methods.

Multistep index optical fibers with high-GeO 2 -doped core and two cladding layers were chemically etched to a sharp point (10 nm in diameter) in NH 4 F/HF buffer solutions. The etched fibers had a defined geometry and the etching process was highly reproducible. After etching, a layer of gold was sputtered on the fibers. The Au-coated fibers were then insulated by electrophoretic paint. The size and shape of the electrodes were determined by steady-state cyclic voltammetry and SECM. The SECM tip current-distance (approach) curves over conductive and insulating substrates agreed with the theoretical curves obtained by numerical simulations, which proves a conical electrode geometry. The base radius and height of the conical electrodes determined by SECM were in the range of 0. 255 - 1. 0 and 0. 3 - 1. 2 ƒÝm, respectively. In order to fabricate electrodes within 200 nm in radius using selectively etched optical fiber as the template, we tried several approaches: (1) Using focused ion beam (FIB) milling we could cut the gold-coated tip at desired size with nanometer precision. However, after <b>electrophoretic</b> paint <b>deposition</b> on FIB modified fibers, the apparent size of the electrode increased against our expectation from FIB, which indicated that gold exposed not only at the tip but also on the side-wall.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the abrupt changes that the {{application}} of large enough electric fields provokes in the internal structure of hematite/silicone oil suspensions. Experimental results reflect the existence of two well-defined structural patterns according {{to the strength of}} the field and the concentration of particles. At low electric fields, columns of particles between the electrodes can be observed when the concentration of solids exceeds a critical volume fraction. However, at higher fields, electrohydrodynamic convection and eventually electrophoretic migration take place, reflecting the relevance of the particle charge. A complete theoretical discussion is given to explain the origin of these so different behaviors. While the mismatch in the electrical properties (particularly, conductivity) of the solid and liquid phases, that is the Maxwell-Wagner polarization, can justify the chain-like structures of particles, it is necessary to take into an account the process of charge injection at the electrode/suspension interface to support the <b>electrophoretic</b> migration and <b>deposition.</b> The experimental conditions for which polarization or current effects predominate are elucidated in terms of the conductivity of the solid phase and the magnitude of the applied electric field.
