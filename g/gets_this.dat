In a full-page album review in Melody Maker, Michael Watts summarised his impression of Harrison's spiritual message: [...] "One <b>gets</b> <b>this</b> feeling of George, somewhat remote and rarefied, indicting the world for being what it is, although if anybody could change the world it would be an old Beatle." [...] While noting the song as an autobiographical statement on the singer's [...] "struggle to retain personal dignity and peace of mind", Watts wrote: [...] "He's dealing in lofty sentiments and abstractions; not everyone will want to drink of the cup." ...|$|E

Also from Billboard, Larry Flick gave the single a particularly positive review; [...] "The follow-up to the top five smash 'Secret' [...] is as perfect as top 40 fare <b>gets.</b> <b>This</b> single has a delightful, immediately memorable melody and chorus, engaging romance-novel lyrics and a lead vocal that is both sweet and quietly soulful. A lovely way for [...] to kick out '95". J. D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun stated that the song, about [...] "innocent romance" [...] has a [...] "gently cascading melody". Peter Calvin from The Advocate praised the lyrical flow of the song, saying that the [...] "effect is truly heartbreaking. The song... shows that ultimately Madonna... is just like you and me".|$|E
