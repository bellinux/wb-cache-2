5|$|Born in Birán, Oriente {{as the son}} of {{a wealthy}} Spanish farmer, Castro adopted leftist anti-imperialist {{politics}} while studying law at the University of Havana. After participating in rebellions against right-wing governments in the Dominican Republic and Colombia, he planned the overthrow of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista, launching a failed attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953. After a year's imprisonment, Castro traveled to Mexico where he formed a revolutionary group, the 26th of July Movement, with his brother Raúl Castro and Che Guevara. Returning to Cuba, Castro took {{a key role in the}} Cuban Revolution by leading the Movement in a guerrilla war against Batista's forces from the Sierra Maestra. After Batista's overthrow in 1959, Castro assumed military and political power as Cuba's Prime Minister. The United States came to oppose Castro's government and unsuccessfully attempted to remove him by assassination, <b>economic</b> <b>blockade</b> and counter-revolution, including the Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961. Countering these threats, Castro formed an alliance with the Soviet Union and allowed the Soviets to place nuclear weapons in Cuba, sparking the Cuban Missile Crisis—a defining incident of the Cold War—in 1962.|$|E
25|$|Nicaragua's {{economy was}} devastated in the 1980s by the Contra War, which saw the {{destruction}} {{of much of the}} country's infrastructure. At the same time, the US staged an <b>economic</b> <b>blockade</b> from 1985 onward.|$|E
25|$|Relations between India and Nepal {{reached its}} lowest during 1989 when India imposed a 13-month-long <b>economic</b> <b>blockade</b> of Nepal. Indian PM Narendra Modi visited Nepal in 2014, the first by an Indian PM in nearly 17 years.|$|E

5000|$|He {{began the}} Venetian policy of {{expansion}} {{on the mainland}} after 932. Pietro Candiano II began a bitter <b>economic</b> <b>blockading</b> war against Istria early in his rule. He burnt Venice's neighbor and potential rival, Comacchio, to the ground following a trifling diplomatic incident. His son, Pietro III Candiano, would become doge in 942.|$|R
25|$|All countries, {{including}} the United States and Haiti broke off {{diplomatic relations with}} the Dominican Republic. Additionally an <b>economic</b> <b>blockade</b> that affected the exports of sugar was applied, which {{at that time was}} the pillar of the Dominican economy.|$|E
25|$|Franco-Prussian {{tensions}} gradually increased after Austerlitz. Napoleon {{insisted that}} Prussia should join his <b>economic</b> <b>blockade</b> of Great Britain. This adversely affected the German merchant class. Napoleon ordered a raid to seize a subversive, anti-Napoleonic bookseller named Johann Philipp Palm in August 1806, {{and made a}} final attempt to secure terms with Britain by offering her Hanover, which infuriated Prussia.|$|E
25|$|The Allied {{blockade}} of Germany {{played a role}} in this: from 6 November 1914, Germany was subjected to an <b>economic</b> <b>blockade</b> by the Entente nations. The military administration responsible for supplying the camps had much difficulty in feeding the troops, considered a priority, which partly explains the catastrophic state of supplies in the camps. Prisoners were not the only ones to suffer from the situation; the general population was also affected.|$|E
5000|$|A Ranvir Sena sympathiser, {{who spoke}} to the Hindu {{correspondent}} Shoumojit Banerjee, justified the mobilisation of the upper castes against those Naxals. [...] "The land is ours. The crops belong to us.

50|$|As winter approached, {{both sides}} largely abstained from {{launching}} full-scale offensives {{so as to}} preserve resources, such as gas and electricity, for domestic use. Despite the opening of an economic highway to the residents living in Karabakh, both Armenia and the enclave suffered a great deal due to the <b>economic</b> <b>blockades</b> imposed by Azerbaijan. While not completely shut off, material aid sent through Turkey arrived sporadically.|$|R
50|$|On 17 June 2007, the four-state Community for Democracy and Peoples' Rights {{signed in}} Tiraspol—the capital of Transnistria—the joint Declaration on {{principles}} of peaceful and fair {{settlement of the}} Georgian-Abkhazian, Georgian-Ossetian, Azeri-Karabakh and Moldovan-Transnistrian conflicts. It calls for barring all types of pressure, such as military deployments, diplomatic isolation, <b>economic</b> <b>blockades,</b> or information wars, during negotiations toward resolution of conflicts. It also calls for external guarantees to eventual political settlements of these conflicts.|$|R
25|$|Georgia {{effectively}} {{lost control}} over Abkhazia {{and the latter}} established as a de facto independent territory. The relations between Russia and Abkhazia improved in the late 1990s and the <b>economic</b> <b>blockade</b> of Abkhazia was lifted. The laws were also passed allowing other countries {{to become part of}} Russian Federation, which was interpreted by some as an offer to Abkhazia and other unrecognised countries of the former Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 the RCG set up Rock Around the Blockade (RATB), a {{solidarity}} organisation {{with the}} Cuban Revolution. As well as campaigning {{on issues such}} as the US <b>economic</b> <b>blockade</b> and the Cuban Five, and sending political solidarity brigades to Cuba, RATB raised funds to take sound systems out to Cuba. These were used with young people in cultural and political work, and the RATB has donated five sound systems over a ten-year period.|$|E
25|$|After the Israeli {{withdrawal}} of settlers, the Palestinian Authority {{took control of}} Gaza. On January 25, 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections in both Gaza and the West Bank. Israel, the U.S. {{and a number of}} European governments refused to recognize Hamas’ election victory and imposed an <b>economic</b> <b>blockade</b> on Gaza. During June 2007, an internal civil conflict between Hamas and Fatah resulted in Hamas taking control of the Gaza Strip, while Fatah ruled the West Bank.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Portugal was a neutral nation, but this progressively changed due in most part to its concerns over its dependencies and <b>economic</b> <b>blockades</b> with its main markets. Following a request by England to detain German nationals, Germany declared war on Portugal (which was reciprocated on 9 March 1916). The original detainees and subsequent German nationals were transferred to the Fortress of São João Baptista between 1916 and 1919 (the end of the War).|$|R
50|$|During {{a dispute}} between Baghdad and Samarra in early 886, {{in which the}} two cities {{implemented}} <b>economic</b> <b>blockades</b> against each other, Ahmad was blamed by the residents of Baghdad for a rise in food prices after he prohibited estate owners from threshing and distributing their crops. In late March a mob assembled outside of his residence, but they were attacked by Ahmad's troops and several of them were killed. Further violence was prevented only by the intervention of Muhammad ibn Tahir, who rode to the area the next day and convinced the people to disperse.|$|R
50|$|In June 2017, Saudi Arabia and {{a number}} of allied {{countries}} broke off relations with Qatar over their alleged support of ISIL. This resulted in a realignment of loyalties, with Turkey supporting Qatar after Saudi Arabia <b>economic</b> <b>blockades</b> imposed on it. This eventuated in a flow on affect in the TFSA area, with a rift in some of the TFSA forces. On the 6 June, fighting in the TFSA held area, in al-Bab city, broke out between Turkish and Qatari-backed rebels and other militias, some of whom were supported by Saudi Arabia.|$|R
25|$|In 1951 Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq {{received}} the vote required from the parliament to nationalize the British-owned oil industry, {{in a situation}} known as the Abadan Crisis. Despite British pressure, including an <b>economic</b> <b>blockade,</b> the nationalization continued. Mosaddeq was briefly removed from power in 1952 but was quickly re-appointed by the shah, due to a popular uprising {{in support of the}} premier and he, in turn, forced the Shah into a brief exile in August 1953 after a failed military coup by Imperial Guard Colonel Nematollah Nassiri.|$|E
25|$|German {{bombing of}} Britain {{reached its peak}} in October and November 1940. In post war interrogation, Wilhelm Keitel {{described}} the aims as <b>economic</b> <b>blockade,</b> in conjunction with submarine warfare, and attrition of Britain's military and economic resources. The Luftwaffe wanted to achieve victory on its own, and was reluctant {{to cooperate with the}} navy. Their strategy for blockade was to destroy ports and storage facilities in towns and cities. Priorities were based on the pattern of trade and distribution, so for these months London was the main target. In November their attention turned to other ports and industrial targets around Britain.|$|E
25|$|Following the Kuwait–Najd War of 1919–20, Ibn Saud {{imposed a}} trade {{blockade}} against Kuwait from the years 1923 until 1937. The {{goal of the}} Saudi economic and military attacks on Kuwait was to annex as much of Kuwait's territory as possible. At the Uqair conference in 1922, the boundaries of Kuwait and Najd were set; {{as a result of}} British interference, Kuwait had no representative at the Uqair conference. Ibn Saud persuaded Sir Percy Cox to give him two-thirds of Kuwait's territory. More than half of Kuwait was lost due to Uqair. After the Uqair conference, Kuwait was still subjected to a Saudi <b>economic</b> <b>blockade</b> and intermittent Saudi raiding.|$|E
50|$|For 150 years {{following}} {{the onset of the}} Black Death in 1348-9, England's population, agricultural production, prices, and credit available for trade all declined. This phenomenon reached its apex between 1440-1480, in a downturn known as the Great Slump. Economic activity associated with the wool trade was especially affected, and Kent, Sussex and Wiltshire all suffered during the slump. This situation was aggravated by the final conflicts of the Hundred Years' War, which devastated regions of France critical to English trade, resulted in <b>economic</b> <b>blockades,</b> and caused some to blame Henry VI for their economic hardship.|$|R
50|$|Nanniwan is a gorge about 90 km {{southeast}} of Yan'an, Shaanxi province. In response to <b>economic</b> <b>blockades</b> by the Imperial Japanese Army and Kuomintang in 1941, the Communists {{set up an}} Opium production committee with Ren Bishi as its head and began experimenting with small scale agricultural development as well as poppy production {{in a bid to}} become self-sufficient. The 359th brigade of the Eighth Route Army was deployed to Nanniwan to improve productivity. In 1943 Nanniwan was heralded a success, and a propagandist song was commissioned. The lyrics, written by He Jingzhi, were set to a traditional folk melody of northern Shaanxi.|$|R
5000|$|Ram Dayal Munda reignited the {{movement}} for Jharkhand by unifying splinter groups among the tribals. Under his guidance the Jharkhand Coordination Committee was constituted in June 1987, comprising 48 organisations and group including the JMM factions. Due to Ram Dayal Munda, Shibu Soren, Suraj Mandal, Simon Marandi, Shailendra Mahato, and AJSU leaders like Surya Singh Besra and Prabhakar Tirkey briefly shared a political platform, but the JMM pulled out of JCC as it felt that 'the collective leadership was a farce'. The JMM/AJSU and JPP successfully orchestrated so-called bandhs, <b>economic</b> <b>blockades</b> in 1988-89. In the interim, ...|$|R
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Iraq imposed an <b>economic</b> <b>blockade</b> over the region, {{reducing}} its oil and food supplies. Elections held in June 1992 produced an inconclusive outcome, with the assembly divided almost equally {{between the two}} main parties and their allies. During this period, the Kurds were subjected to a double embargo: one imposed by the United Nations on Iraq and one imposed by Saddam Hussein on their region. The severe economic hardships caused by the embargoes fueled tensions between the two dominant political parties, the KDP and the PUK, over control of trade routes and resources. Relations between the PUK and the KDP started to become dangerously strained from September 1993 after rounds of amalgamations occurred between parties. This led to internecine and intra-Kurdish conflict and warfare between 1994 and 1996.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the English changed their strategy. Rather than {{focusing}} on punitive expeditions as favoured by his father, the young Prince Henry adopted a strategy of <b>economic</b> <b>blockade.</b> Using the castles that remained in English control, he gradually began to retake Wales while cutting off trade and the supply of weapons. By 1407 this strategy was beginning to bear fruit, even though by this time Owain's rebel soldiers had achieved victories over the King's men as far as Birmingham, where the English were in retreat. In the autumn, Owain's Aberystwyth Castle surrendered while he was away fighting. In 1409, it was the turn of Harlech Castle. Edmund Mortimer died in the final battle, and Owain's wife Margaret along {{with two of his}} daughters (including Catrin) and three of Mortimer's granddaughters were imprisoned in the Tower of London. They were all to die in the Tower before 1415.|$|E
25|$|The Serb-dominated Yugoslav People's Army {{attacked}} Croatia from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their first {{target was}} Croatian village Ravno that was attacked on 2 November 1991 and completely destroyed. Yugoslavia effected an <b>economic</b> <b>blockade</b> of Bosnia and Herzegovina, thus {{trying to keep}} it as part of Yugoslavia. Later, Yugoslavia claimed territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina with a Serb majority and the capital Sarajevo. Serb Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was declared on 27 March 1992 with the goal to incorporate parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina into Yugoslavia. The objective of Serbian politics in Bosnia and Herzegovina was to unite Serbian autonomous provinces into a single unit that would join Yugoslavia, and with total blockade of Sarajevo, break Bosnia and Herzegovina into smaller, unconnected and hardly defensible enclaves. Because of superiority in armaments, support from Belgrade and an embargo on the importation of arms into Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbs achieved their goals by June 1992.|$|E

Nevertheless, Russian prospects for profit remained limited in the German-dominated trade league, including <b>economic</b> <b>blockades</b> preventing Novgorod from trading with Livonia.

25|$|By 1415, full English {{rule was}} {{returned}} to Wales. The leading rebels were dead, imprisoned, or impoverished through massive fines. Scarcely a parish or family in Wales, English or Welsh, had not been affected in some way. The cost in loss of life, physical destruction, and ruined lives was enormous. Wales, already a poor country {{on the border of}} England, was further impoverished by pillage, <b>economic</b> <b>blockade</b> and communal fines. Reports by travellers talk of ruined castles, such as Montgomery Castle and Abbeys such as Strata Florida Abbey and Abbeycwmhir. Grass grew in the market squares of many towns such as Oswestry and Welsh commerce had almost ground to a halt. Land that had previously been productive was now empty wasteland with no tenants to work the land. As late as 1492, a Royal Official in lowland Glamorgan was still citing the devastation caused by the revolt as the reason why he was unable to deliver promised revenues to the King.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the English were {{adopting}} a different strategy. Rather {{than focusing on}} punitive expeditions favoured by his father, the young Henry of Monmouth adopted a strategy of <b>economic</b> <b>blockade.</b> Using the castles that remained in English control he gradually began to retake Wales while cutting off trade and the supply of weapons. By 1407 this strategy was beginning to bear fruit. In March, 1,000 men from all over Flintshire appeared before the Chief Justitiar of the county and agreed to pay a communal fine for their adherence to Glyndŵr. Gradually the same pattern was repeated throughout the country. In July the Earl of Arundel’s north-east Lordship around Oswestry and Clun submitted. One by one the Lordships began to surrender. By midsummer, Owain’s castle at Aberystwyth was under siege. That autumn Aberystwyth Castle surrendered. In 1409 it was the turn of Harlech Castle. Last minute desperate envoys {{were sent to the}} French for help. There was no response. Gruffydd Young was sent to Scotland to attempt to coordinate action but nothing was to come of that either. Harlech Castle fell in 1409. Edmund Mortimer died in the final battle and Owain’s wife Margaret along with two of his daughters (including Catrin) and three of his Mortimer granddaughters were taken prisoner and incarcerated in the Tower of London. They were all to die in the Tower before 1415.|$|E
500|$|After Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, France and the British Empire {{declared}} war on Germany and imposed an <b>economic</b> <b>blockade.</b> The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was sent to help defend France. After the Phoney War of October 1939 to April 1940, Germany invaded Belgium, the Netherlands, and France on 10 May 1940. Three of their Panzer corps attacked through the Ardennes and drove northwest to the English Channel. By 21 May, German forces had trapped the BEF, {{the remains of the}} Belgian forces, and three French field armies along the northern coast of France. Commander of the BEF, General Viscount Gort, immediately saw evacuation across the Channel as the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest good port.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} of his {{withdrawal}} 26 Turkish Cypriots had been killed. Turkey replied with an ultimatum demanding that Grivas be removed from the island, that the troops smuggled from Greece in excess of the limits of the Treaty of Alliance be removed, and that the <b>economic</b> <b>blockades</b> on the Turkish Cypriot enclaves be lifted. Grivas resigned his position and 12,000 Greek troops were withdrawn. Makarios now attempted to consolidate his position by reducing the number of National Guard troops, and by creating a paramilitary force loyal to Cypriot independence. In 1968, acknowledging that enosis was now all but impossible, Makarios stated, [...] "A solution by necessity must be sought within the limits of what is feasible which does not always coincide with the limits of what is desirable." ...|$|R
50|$|More significantly, {{enforcing}} the <b>economic</b> <b>blockades</b> led both the United Kingdom and France {{into a series}} of military engagements. The British bombarded Copenhagen in September 1807 (Battle of Copenhagen) to prevent the Danish joining the Continental System, and the British policy of stopping neutral ships trading with France played a large part in the outbreak of the Anglo-American War of 1812 (the three most repugnant to the Americans were in fact repealed five days after the declaration of war, but before Prime Minister Lord Liverpool was aware of it). However, it was Napoleon's invasion of Russia in the same year, again in part to enforce his continental system, that proved to be the turning point of the war. He was never able to recover militarily from that defeat.|$|R
