5|$|Preceding {{an atomic}} line filter {{may be a}} collimator, which {{straightens}} incident light rays for passing {{through the rest of}} the filter consistently; however, collimated light is not always necessary. After the collimator, a <b>high-pass</b> <b>filter</b> blocks almost half of the incoming light (that of too long a wavelength). In Faraday and Voigt filters, the first polarizing plate is used here to block light.|$|E
5|$|An absorption-re-emission atomic {{line filter}} absorbs the desired {{wavelength}} {{of light and}} emits light that bypasses broadband filters. In passive absorption-re-emission ALFs, a <b>high-pass</b> <b>filter</b> blocks all low-energy incoming light. The vapor cell absorbs the signal, which coincides with the vapor's thin absorption line, and the cell's atoms become excited. The vapor cell then re-emits the signal light by undergoing fluorescence at a lower frequency. A low-pass filter blocks radiation above {{the frequency of the}} fluorescent light. In an active ALF, optical or electrical pumping is used for exciting these atoms so they absorb or emit light of different wavelengths. For active ALFs, other systems of conventional filters may be needed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{continue}} our investigation of symmetric tight framelet filter banks (STFFBs) with a minimum number of generators in [7]. In particular, we shall systematically study STFFBs with three <b>high-pass</b> <b>filters</b> which are derived from the oblique extension principle. To our best knowledge, except the papers [1, 11], {{there are no other}} papers in the literature so far systematically studying this problem. In this paper we show that there are two different types, types I and II, of STFFBs with three <b>high-pass</b> <b>filters.</b> Then we provide a detailed analysis and a complete algorithm to obtain all type I STFFBs with three <b>high-pass</b> <b>filters.</b> Our results not only significantly generalize the results in [1, 11], but also help us answer several unresolved problems on STFFBs. Based on [7], we also propose an algorithm to construct all type II STFFBs with three <b>high-pass</b> <b>filters</b> and with the shortest possible filter supports. Several examples are given to illustrate the results and algorithms in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss how}} {{one can use}} certain filters from signal {{processing}} to describe isomorphisms between certain projective C(T n) -modules. Conversely, we show how cancellation properties for finitely generated projective modules over C(T n) can often be used to prove the existence of continuous high pass filters, of the kind needed for multi-wavelets, corresponding to a given continuous low-pass filter. However, we also give {{an example of a}} continuous low-pass filter for which it is impossible to find corresponding continuous <b>high-pass</b> <b>filters.</b> In this way we give another approach to the solution of the matrix completion problem for filters of the kind arising in wavelet theory. A key technique in wavelet theory is to use suitable low-pass filters to construct scaling functions and their multi-resolution analyses, and then to use corresponding <b>high-pass</b> <b>filters</b> to construct the corresponding multi-wavelets. Thus once one has used a low-pass filter to construct a scaling function, {{it is important to be}} able to find associated <b>high-pass</b> <b>filters.</b> (They are not unique.) It has been pointed out several times in the literature that, given a continuous low-pass filter for dilation by q> 2, there is in general no continuous selection function for the construction of associated continuous <b>high-pass</b> <b>filters,</b> because of the existence of topological obstructions. (See the substantial discussion in section 2 of [4], and the references cited there. It is known [4] that associated <b>high-pass</b> <b>filters</b> which are measurable will always exist.) The problem of finding appropriate <b>high-pass</b> <b>filters</b> given a low-pass filter is closely related to the more general problem of completing an n Ã—n unitary matrix whose entries take values in C(T n...|$|R

25|$|High-pass and {{low-pass}} filters {{are also used}} in digital image processing to perform image modifications, enhancements, noise reduction, etc., using designs done in either the spatial domain or the frequency domain. The unsharp masking, or sharpening, operation used in image editing software is a high-boost filter, a generalization of high-pass. A <b>high-pass</b> <b>filter,</b> if the imaging software does not provide one, {{can be achieved by}} duplicating the image, applying a Gaussian blur to the dupe, inverting the colors, and blending the images using a low opacity (say 50%) for the dupe.|$|E
25|$|The third-generation iPod had a weak bass response, {{as shown}} in audio tests. The {{combination}} of the undersized DC-blocking capacitors and the typical low impedance of most consumer headphones form a <b>high-pass</b> <b>filter,</b> which attenuates the low-frequency bass output. Similar capacitors {{were used in the}} fourth-generation iPods. The problem is reduced when using high-impedance headphones and is completely masked when driving high-impedance (line level) loads, such as an external headphone amplifier. The first-generation iPod Shuffle uses a dual-transistor output stage, rather than a single capacitor-coupled output, and does not exhibit reduced bass response for any load.|$|E
25|$|Temporal {{filtering}} is {{the removal}} of frequencies of no interest from the signal. A voxel's intensity change over time can be represented as the sum {{of a number of}} different repeating waves with differing periods and heights. A plot with these periods on the x-axis and the heights on the y-axis is called a power spectrum, and this plot is created with the Fourier transform technique. Temporal filtering amounts to removing the periodic waves not of interest to us from the power spectrum, and then summing the waves back again, using the inverse Fourier transform to create a new timecourse for the voxel. A <b>high-pass</b> <b>filter</b> removes the lower frequencies, and the lowest frequency that can be identified with this technique is the reciprocal of twice the TR. A low-pass filter removes the higher frequencies, while a band-pass filter removes all frequencies except the particular range of interest.|$|E

25|$|<b>High-pass</b> <b>filters</b> {{have many}} applications. They {{are used as}} part of an audio {{crossover}} to direct high frequencies to a tweeter while attenuating bass signals which could interfere with, or damage, the speaker. When such a filter is built into a loudspeaker cabinet it is normally a passive filter that also includes a low-pass filter for the woofer and so often employs both a capacitor and inductor (although very simple <b>high-pass</b> <b>filters</b> for tweeters can consist of a series capacitor and nothing else).|$|R
25|$|Temporal {{resolution}} of fMRI is limited by: (1) the feedback mechanism {{that raises the}} blood flow operating slowly; (2) having to wait till net magnetization recovers before sampling a slice again; and (3) having to acquire multiple slices to cover the whole brain or region of interest. Advanced techniques to improve temporal resolution address these issues. Using multiple coils speeds up acquisition time in exact proportion to the coils used. Another technique is to decide which parts of the signal matter less and drop those. This could be either those sections of the image that repeat often in a spatial map (that is small clusters dotting the image periodically) or those sections repeating infrequently (larger clusters). The first, a <b>high-pass</b> <b>filter</b> in k-space, has been proposed by Gary H. Glover and colleagues at Stanford. These mechanisms assume the researcher has {{an idea of the}} expected shape of the activation image.|$|E
25|$|High-pass {{filters are}} also used for AC {{coupling}} at the inputs of many audio power amplifiers, for preventing the amplification of DC currents which may harm the amplifier, rob the amplifier of headroom, and generate waste heat at the loudspeakers voice coil. One amplifier, the professional audio model DC300 made by Crown International beginning in the 1960s, did not have high-pass filtering at all, and {{could be used to}} amplify the DC signal of a common 9-volt battery at the input to supply 18 volts DC in an emergency for mixing console power. However, that model's basic design has been superseded by newer designs such as the Crown Macro-Tech series developed in the late 1980s which included 10Hz high-pass filtering on the inputs and switchable 35Hz high-pass filtering on the outputs. Another example is the QSC Audio PLX amplifier series which includes an internal 5Hz <b>high-pass</b> <b>filter</b> which is applied to the inputs whenever the optional 50 and 30Hz high-pass filters are turned off.|$|E
25|$|Mixing {{consoles}} {{often include}} high-pass filtering at each channel strip. Some models have fixed-slope, fixed-frequency high-pass filters at 80 or 100Hz {{that can be}} engaged; other models have sweepable high-pass filters, filters of fixed slope that can be set within a specified frequency range, such as from 20 to 400Hz on the Midas Heritage 3000, or 20 to 20,000Hz on the Yamaha M7CL digital mixing console. Veteran systems engineer and live sound mixer Bruce Main recommends that high-pass filters be engaged for most mixer input sources, except for those such as kick drum, bass guitar and piano, sources which will have useful low frequency sounds. Main writes that DI unit inputs (as opposed to microphone inputs) do not need high-pass filtering as they {{are not subject to}} modulation by low-frequency stage washâ€”low frequency sounds coming from the subwoofers or the public address system and wrapping around to the stage. Main indicates that high-pass filters are commonly used for directional microphones which have a proximity effectâ€”a low-frequency boost for very close sources. This low frequency boost commonly causes problems up to 200 or 300Hz, but Main notes that he has seen microphones that benefit from a 500Hz <b>high-pass</b> <b>filter</b> setting on the console.|$|E

Background. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the individual effects of envelope enhancement and <b>high-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> (500 Hz) on word identification scores in quiet for individuals with Auditory Neuropathy. Method. Twelve individuals with Auditory Neuropathy (six males and six females) with ages ranging from 12 to 40 years participated in the study.

Results. Word identification scores showed a mean improvement of 18 % with envelope enhanced versus unprocessed speech. No significant improvement was observed with <b>high-pass</b> <b>filtered</b> versus unprocessed speech. Conclusion. These results suggest that the compression/expansion signal processing strategy enhances speech identification scoresâ€”at least for mild and moderately impaired individuals with AN. In contrast, simple <b>high-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> (i. e., eliminating the low-frequency content of the signal) does not improve speech perception in quiet for individuals with Auditory Neuropathy. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Three {{common types}} of washout filters include classical, {{adaptive}} and optimal washout filters. The classical washout filter comprises linear low-pass and <b>high-pass</b> <b>filters.</b> The signal into the filter is split into translation and rotational signals. <b>High-pass</b> <b>filters</b> {{are used for}} simulating transient translational and rotational accelerations, while the low-pass filters are used to simulate sustaining accelerations.

30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that adequate <b>high-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> {{may be more important}} than the choice of the ICA method: all three ICA methods achieved a better ERD peak score when the data had been high-pass-filtered at the cutoff frequency just below the frequency band of interest before decomposition. The effect was most prominent for Infomax and FastICA. However, <b>high-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> at the cutoff frequency had a negative impact on the dipolarity score. The effect of <b>high-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> thus strongly depends on the intended subsequent analysis and is not always beneficial. Filtering might guide the decomposition toward extracting the components that explain the activity we are interested in. That is, if (and only if) we are not interested in low frequencies in further analysis, we may benefit from removing them before ICA decomposition. This effect seems to be relevant, probably because the low-frequency parts of an EEG signal contain a large portion of its variance.|$|R
