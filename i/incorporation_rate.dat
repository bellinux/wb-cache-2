40|$|Load-bearing cartilages {{regularly}} experience {{changes in}} fluid content {{as the result}} of changing load. It has been found that these changes in fluid content influence proteoglycan synthesis. The mechanism for this effect is not known. We have measured the influence of changes in cartilage hydration on the [35 S]sulphate <b>incorporation</b> <b>rate</b> in both bovine nasal and human articular cartilage in medium whose concentration varied over the range 0. 2 - 2 -times physiological strength. In physiological medium the <b>incorporation</b> <b>rate</b> fell in proportion to fluid loss with a 10 % fall in cartilage hydration resulting in a 30 - 50 % decrease in 35 S-incorporation rates. However, in medium of 0. 5 -times physiological strength, where the <b>incorporation</b> <b>rate</b> was only 40 % of control values, the <b>incorporation</b> <b>rate</b> increased initially rather than falling as the cartilage lost fluid. These changes in hydration and hence proteoglycan content resulted in changes in the extracellular ionic composition of cartilage. When this was monitored in terms of [Na+]c, the internal sodium concentration, as a marker for changes in cartilage ionic composition, we found that <b>incorporation</b> <b>rate</b> varied with [Na+]c rather than directly with hydration...|$|E

40|$|In aquatic ecosystems, [3 H]thymidine {{incorporation}} into bacterial DNA and [3 H]leucine {{incorporation into}} proteins are usually {{used to estimate}} bacterial production. The <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates</b> of four amino acids (leucine, tyrosine, lysine, alanine) into proteins of bacteria were measured in parallel on natural freshwater samples from the basin of the river Meuse (Belgium). Comparison of the incorporation into proteins and into the total macromolecular fraction showed that these different amino acids were incorporated at more than 90 % into proteins.

The <b>incorporation</b> <b>rate</b> of B was proportional to the B 2 H 6 partial pressure and was larger for Ge-rich films.

Since the <b>incorporation</b> <b>rate</b> of B increased with exposure time of B 2 H 6 during Si 1 -xGex deposition at early stage, it was suggested that B doping was limited by the B-hydride adsorption rate.

Pressures in the "physiological" range (5 - 15 MPa) applied for 20 s or for 5 min could stimulate tracer incorporation (30 - 130 %) during the following 2 h, but higher pressures (20 - 50 MPa) had no effect on <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates.</b> The degree of stimulation in cartilage obtained from different animals was found to vary; in some animals none was seen. Stimulation also varied with position along the joint. Physiological pressures (5 - 10 MPa) applied continuously for the 2 -h incubation period also stimulated <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates,</b> but pressures greater than 20 MPa always produced a decrease that was related to the applied pressure and that was reversible.

The LD slag was incorporated into the contaminated soil to consist four treatments: 0 % (T 1), 1 % (T 2), 2 % (T 3), and 4 % (T 4) per air-dried soil weight. A similar uncontaminated soil {{was used as}} a control (CTRL). After a one-month reaction period, potted soils (1 kg) were used for a 2 -week growth experiment with dwarf beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Soil pH increased with the <b>incorporation</b> <b>rate</b> of LD slag from 5. 7 in the T 1 soil up to 7. 9 in the T 4 soil.

40|$|Plant-derived lipids are {{regarded}} to be mainly incorporated into soil via above ground biomass. The contribution of root-derived lipids to {{soil organic matter}} (SOM) is not easily accessible, so this incorporation pathway is mostly underestimated, whereas it is common knowledge that the contribution of rhizodeposits to SOM is of major importance for the turnover of organic carbon. Not only the contribution, but also the <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates</b> and turnover time of exclusively root-derived lipids remain unknown. We determined {{for the first time}} the <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates</b> of rhizodeposit-derived lipids into soil planted with Lolium perenne, using a multiple 14 CO 2 pulse labelling experiment carried out under controlled laboratory conditions. Additionally, we accessed differences in lipid composition between the rhizosphere and root-free soil to evaluate the direct contribution of root-derived lipids to SOM. The lipid composition in the rhizosphere clearly showed a greater abundance of microbial lipids like C 16 : 1 and C 18 : 1, as well as root-derived C 18 : 2 + 3 fatty acids (FAs) than the initial and root-free soil. The <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates</b> of total lipids (kLip) and FAs (kFA) based on 14 C data revealed a very fast incorporation into SOM (rhizosphere: kLip 0. 82 year⁻¹; kFA 0. 31 year⁻¹; root-free soil: kLip 0. 70 year⁻¹; kFA 0. 48 year⁻¹) after the first 14 C pulse for young plants. Thereafter, <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates</b> decreased until the end of the experiment (rhizosphere: kLip 0. 17 year⁻¹; kFA 0. 03 year⁻¹; root-free loess: kLip 0. 11 year⁻¹; kFA 0. 06 year⁻¹). The <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates</b> resulting from the 14 C pulse labelling experiment are comparable to turnover rates of total, i. e. above ground and root-derived, and lipids from field experiments using 13 C labelling approaches. The fast allocation of root-derived lipids to substrate beneath, and distant from, roots gives new insights into the carbon incorporation of OM on a molecular level. This implies that incorporation of lipid compounds, especially into soil deeper than the uppermost few centimetres or the ploughing layer, is mainly due to root-derived OM, in contrast to common knowledge...|$|R

During 2006 we performed 20 dilution experiments for determining the spatiotemporal variability of empirical CFs in temperate Atlantic coastal waters. Values (0. 49 to 1. 92 kg C mol Leu− 1) showed maxima in autumn to early winter and minima in summer. Spatially averaged CFs were significantly negatively correlated with in situ leucine <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates</b> (r = − 0. 91) and positively correlated with phosphate concentrations (r = 0. 76). These relationships, together with a strong positive covariation between cell-specific leucine <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates</b> and carbon contents (r = 0. 85), were interpreted as a strategy to maximize survival through protein synthesis and low growth rates under nutrient limitation (low CFs) until favorable conditions stimulate cell division relative to protein synthesis (high CFs). A multiple regression with in situ leucine <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates</b> and cellular carbon contents explained 96 % of CF variance in our ecosystem, suggesting their potential prediction from more easily measurable routine variables.

Two of the colony-forming species, when damaged, produced polyunsaturated aldehydes (oxylipins) {{that have been found}} to impair the reproduction of marine copepods.

Daphnia body length versus ingestion rate regressions differed for single-celled and colony-forming diatoms. Ingestion rates for single-celled diatoms showed clear size dependencies and high correlation coefficients, while the dependency was weak for colony-forming diatoms and individual variability was high. This difference was not observed for carbon <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates,</b> which showed low variability for all diatoms. Asterionella formosa yielded the lowest <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates</b> due to low incorporation efficiency, while all other diatoms were incorporated at similar rates.

Studies were carried out on samples from the NE Atlantic under the range of pressures (1 – 430 atm) encountered by sinking aggregates during their journey to the deep-sea bed. Thymidine and leucine incorporation rates per bacterium attached to sinking particles from 200 m were about six and ten times higher, respectively, than the free-living bacterial assemblage. The ratio of leucine <b>incorporation</b> <b>rate</b> per cell to thymidine <b>incorporation</b> <b>rate</b> per cell was significantly different between the larger attached (18. 9 : 1) and smaller free-living (10. 4 : 1) assemblages. The rates of leucine and thymidine incorporation decreased exponentially with increasing pressure for the free-living and linearly for attached bacteria, while {{there was no significant}} influence {{of pressure on}} cell numbers. At 100 atm leucine and thymidine <b>incorporation</b> <b>rate</b> per free-living bacterium was reduced to 73 and 20 %, respectively, relative to that measured at 1 atm.

There was no significant uncoupling of thymidine and leucine incorporation for either the free-living or attached bacterial assemblages with increasing pressure, indicating that the processess of DNA and protein synthesis may be equally affected by increasing pressure. It is therefore unlikely that bacteria, originating from surface waters, attached to rapidly sinking particles play a role in particle remineralization below approximately 1000 – 2000 m. These results may help to explain the occurrence of relatively fresh aggregates on the deep-sea bed that still contain sufficient organic carbon to fuel the rapid growth of benthic micro-organisms; they also indicate that the effect of pressure on microbial processes may be important in oceanic biogeochemical cycles...|$|E

This contaminant obscures {{the measurement of}} the rate of chloroplast DNA synthesis when methyl-labeled preparations are used. Such contaminants are not present in ring-labeled (either 3 H or 14 C) thymidine preparations. In ring-labeled thymidine preparations, a slower <b>incorporation</b> <b>rate</b> commensurate with cell density is observed. These slower, long-term incorporation kinetics would be expected for the utilization of bona fide thymidine into chloroplast DNA...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial abundance, [H- 3]thymidine <b>incorporation</b> <b>rate</b> and {{heterotrophic}} nanoflagellate abundance {{were measured}} {{in the water column}} along transects perpendicular to the Kenyan coast (western Indian Ocean) during June-July (SE monsoon) and November-December (intermonsoon) 1992. Bacterial abundance was low (less than 6 x 10 (5) cells ml(- 1)). Bacterial production estimated from thymidine <b>incorporation</b> <b>rate</b> at near-coastal stations was higher during the intermonsoon period. Production estimates decreased with depth and distance from the coast. Growth rates of bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellate abundance were higher during the intermonsoon, indicating a higher turnover than during the SE monsoon. Grazing rates by nanoflagellates, based on their abundance, were estimated to be 100 % or more of bacterial production. Bacteria probably supply only part of the nanoflagellate carbon demand. Bacterial production (BP) was high compared with primary production (PP), with average BPnet/PPnet ratios of much greater than 100 % and 34 % during the SE monsoon and intermonsoon, respectively. Compared with open oceanic regions, both BP and PP in Kenyan coastal waters are low. We conclude that BP is not directly coupled to PP and that recycled carbon, e. g. via grazing, is an important source for bacterial growth.

40|$|III–V {{nitrides}} are intensely researched for optoelectronic applications {{spanning the}} entire visible spectrum. In spite of realization of commercial devices and advances in processing {{of materials and}} devices, {{the understanding of the}} processing and epitaxial growth of these materials is incomplete. In this study, a rate equation approach is proposed based on physically sound surface processes to investigate the molecular beam epitaxy growth of GaN using ammonia. A surface riding layer of Ga and ammonia and its associated dynamics such as incorporation of Ga and N in to the crystal and desorption are included in the model. Rates of all surface processes are assumed Arrhenius type. The simulated Ga <b>incorporation</b> <b>rate</b> as a function of ammonia pressure and substrate temperature are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Ga incorporation increases with increasing NH 3 overpressure and saturates at a maximum value at large NH 3 overpressure. The Ga <b>incorporation</b> <b>rate</b> exhibits a peak at 820 °C due to competition between thermally activated pyrolysis of NH 3 and reevaporation of Ga from the surface. The simulated Ga desorption parameter versus time data is also in good agreement with the experimental data. These observations will be explained based on the interplay of competing surface processes such as reevaporation and incorporation...|$|E
40|$|Protozoan {{predation}} on {{bacteria and}} bacterioplankton secondary production were simultaneously determined in La Salvaje Beach water during 1990. Protozoan grazing on bacterioplankton was measured from fluorescently labeled bacterium uptake rates; estimates of bacterial secondary production {{were obtained from}} [3 H]thymidine <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates.</b> Two different conversion factors were used to transform thymidine <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates</b> into bacterial production rates; {{both of them were}} specific for La Salvaje Beach and were calculated by using empirical and semitheoretical approaches. The average flagellate predation rate was 14. 0 bacteria flagellate- 1 h- 1; the average population predation rate was 7. 35 x 106 bacteria liter- 1 h- 1. The estimates of bacterial production differed greatly depending on the conversion factor used, and so did the percentages of bacterial production consumed by flagellated protozoa (4. 6 % when the empirical conversion factor for La Salvaje Beach was used and 113 % when the semitheoretical conversion factor specific for this system was used). The ecological implications of each of these values are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Spatial {{variation}} of heterotrophic bacterial pro-duction and phytoplankton primary production were inves-tigated across the eastern South Pacific Ocean (− 141 ◦ W, − 8 ◦ S to − 72 ◦ W, − 35 ◦ S) in November–December 2004. Bacterial production (3 H leucine incorporation) integrated over the euphotic zone encompassed {{a wide range}} of val-ues, from 43 mg C m− 2 d− 1 in the hyper-oligotrophic South Pacific Gyre to 392 mg C m− 2 d− 1 in the upwelling off Chile. In the gyre (120 ◦ W, 22 ◦ S) records of low phytoplankton biomass (7 mg Total Chla m− 2) were obtained and fluxes of in situ 14 C-based particulate primary production were as low as 153 mg C m− 2 d− 1, thus equal to the value considered as a limit for primary production under strong oligotrophic conditions. Average rates of 3 H leucine <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates,</b> and leucine <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates</b> per cell (5 – 21 pmol l− 1 h−...|$|R
40|$|Comparing the {{translational}} {{capacities of}} cell-free systems from aerobically developing embryos of the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana vs. quiescent embryos has revealed a global arrest of protein synthesis. <b>Incorporation</b> <b>rates</b> of [3 H]leucine by lysates from 4 -h anoxic embryos were 8 % of those from aerobic (control) embryos, when assayed at the respective pH values measured for each treatment in vivo. Exposure of embryos to 4 h of aerobic acidosis (elevated CO 2 {{in the presence}} of oxygen) suppressed protein synthesis to 3 % of control values. These latter two experimental treatments promote developmental arrest of Artemia embryos and, concomitantly, cause acute declines in intracellular pH. When lysates from each treatment were assayed over a range of physiologically relevant pH values (pH 6. 4 - 8. 0), amino acid <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates</b> in lysates from quiescent embryos were consistently lower than values for the aerobic controls. Acute reversal of pH to alkaline values during the 6 -min assays was not sufficient to return the <b>incorporation</b> <b>rates</b> of quiescent lysates to control values. Thus, a stable alteration in translational capacity of quiescent lysates is indicated. Addition of exogenous mRNA did not rescue the suppressed protein synthesis in quiescent lysates, which suggests that the acute blockage of amino acid incorporation is apparently not due to limitation in message. Thus, the results support a role for intracellular pH as an initial signaling event in translational control during quiescence yet, at the same time, indicate that a direct proton effect on the translational machinery is not the sole proximal agent for biosynthetic arrest in this primitive crustacean...|$|R
