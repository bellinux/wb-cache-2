5000|$|Initially, {{the song}} had six versions, as Mars called its {{original}} demo a [...] "poolside version", {{which had a}} [...] "piña colada vibe" [...] and contained lyrics such as [...] "fly through a storm on a unicorn ...

[...] "It's called the Tour of the Mongoose, and the mongoose is basically one of the few animals who can defeat the most venomous snakes with just one bite and that's why I decided to name my tour that way, because I think that if we all have a little mongoose inside that can defeat the hatred and the resentment and the prejudice of everyday, we can probably win the battle."

He plainly expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lynched, and his wife screamed out, [...] "Oh, don't hurt him! He isn't a bad man!" [...] But it was only the Altrurian way with a guilty person: they wanted to let him know how sorry they were for him, and since his sin had found him out how hopeful they were for his redemption.
