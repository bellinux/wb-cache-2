40|$|This article {{examines}} factors accounting for <b>higher</b> <b>costs</b> in urban hospitals {{as well as}} their relative contribution to those costs. The costs of urban hospitals are influenced by case mix, wages, competition, the ratio of forecasted to actual admissions, teaching, and the percentage of patients admitted through the emergency room. The bulk of the <b>higher</b> <b>costs</b> in urban hospitals are linked to graduate medical education. Treatment of poor patients and the admission of patients through the emergency room also contribute to the <b>higher</b> <b>costs.</b> <b>Higher</b> inpatient <b>costs</b> stemming from outpatient activities pose distributional problems for hospitals when these costs are not accounted for in prospective (inpatient) rate-setting programs...|$|R

5|$|Held at a {{price of}} C$829 million, the Calgary Olympics cost more to stage than any {{previous}} Games, summer or winter. The <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> was anticipated, as organizers were aware {{at the outset of}} their bid that most facilities would have to be constructed. The venues, constructed primarily with public money, were designed to have lasting use beyond the Games and were planned to become the home of several of Canada's national winter sports teams.|$|E
5|$|Hounds of Love was {{released}} in 1985. Because of the <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> of hiring studio space for her previous album, she built a private studio near her home, where she could work at her own pace. Hounds of Love ultimately topped the charts in the UK, knocking Madonna's Like a Virgin from the number-one position.|$|E
40|$|To {{detect the}} {{differences}} in patterns of prescribing between general practitioners with <b>high</b> and low <b>costs,</b> the costs in prescribing seven symptomatic and seven systematic drug groups were studied in 23 practices with low costs and 23 with <b>high</b> <b>costs</b> in the Belfast area. This was done by extracting information about the individual practices from the Department of Health and Social Services (Northern Ireland) information technology unit's database on prescribing. General practitioners in practices with <b>high</b> <b>costs</b> issued prescriptions more often and for larger quantities of medicine than did their colleagues in practices with low costs {{for all of the}} drug groups studied. There was a lower patient to doctor ratio in the practices with <b>high</b> <b>costs</b> (1786 : 1 v 2039 : 1).

Earth orbit was first achieved by Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union in 1961, and unmanned spacecraft have since reached all of the known planets in the Solar System. Due to the <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> of getting into space, manned spaceflight has been limited to low Earth orbit and the Moon.|$|E
5|$|In late November 2009 Syracuse Crunch owner, Howard Dolgon began {{attempts}} {{to have an}} American Hockey League (AHL) outdoor game for his franchise. Cost estimates for hosting the game were close to $1 million. Unlike the National Hockey League's (NHL) Winter Classic, the league did not run the event, meaning the Crunch had to finance the entire project. The <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> of hosting was a reason for other franchises not pursuing outdoor games prior.|$|E
5|$|Liquid Fly-back Booster (LFBB) was a German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) project {{concept to}} develop a {{reusable}} liquid rocket booster for Ariane 5 in order to significantly reduce a <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> of space transportation and increase environmental friendliness. LFBB would replace existing solid rocket boosters, providing main thrust during the liftoff. Once separated, two winged boosters would perform an atmospheric entry, fly back autonomously to the French Guiana, and land horizontally on the airport like an airplane.|$|E

However, the project is largely no longer under consideration due to its <b>high</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sega {{producer}} Mac Senour {{was responsible}} for the Menacer project and designed the six-game pack. He originally proposed non-shooting minigames based on existing Sega licenses like Joe Montana, David Robinson, and ToeJam & Earl, but most of the prototypes were abandoned due to <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> in favor of more shooting-type games. Sega did not plan another first-party release for the Menacer apart from the included multicart. Compatible games were published through 1995.|$|E

5|$|The grapes exhibit {{an uneven}} pattern of ripening: a single bunch may contain both raisin-like, {{over-ripe}} grapes and green, unripened grapes.
