40|$|Aims/hypothesis Intake {{of dietary}} fibre has been {{associated}} with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, but few European studies have been published on this. We evaluated the association between intake of dietary fibre and type 2 diabetes in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) -InterAct study and in a meta-analysis of prospective studies. Methods During 10. 8 years of follow-up, 11, 559 participants with type 2 diabetes were identified and a subcohort of 15, 258 participants was selected for the case-cohort study. Country-specific HRs were estimated using Prentice-weighted Cox proportional hazards models and were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. Eighteen other cohort studies were identified for the meta-analysis. Results In the EPIC-InterAct Study, dietary fibre intake was associated with a lower risk of diabetes (HRQ 4 vs Q 1 0. 82; 95 % CI 0. 69, 0. 97) after adjustment for lifestyle and dietary factors. Similar inverse associations were observed for the intake of cereal fibre and vegetable fibre, but not <b>fruit</b> <b>fibre.</b> The associations were attenuated and no longer statistically significant after adjustment for BMI. In the meta-analysis (19 cohorts), the summary RRs per 10 g/day increase in intake were 0. 91 (95 % CI 0. 87, 0. 96) for total fibre, 0. 75 (95 % CI 0. 65, 0. 86) for cereal fibre, 0. 95 (95 % CI 0. 87, 1. 03) for <b>fruit</b> <b>fibre</b> and 0. 93 (95 % CI 0. 82, 1. 05) for vegetable fibre.

Agricultural residues have the potentials to be used as energy and chemical source and meet its deficit in the country. This paper focuses on utilization of lignocellulosic materials obtained from two agricultural residues through renewable technology to produce bio-energy and chemical feedstock. The lignocellulosic materials were extracted from palm fruit (Elaeis guineensis) fibre and physic nut (Jatropha curcas) shell, and pyrolyzed under low temperature and pressure at various particle sizes. The main properties of solid (lignocellulosic) materials were tested and the bio-oil produced was analyzed using GC-MS. Results show proximate analyses (volatile, ash and fixed carbon contents) and ultimate analysis (carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, magnesium, phosphorus and zinc). The pH value of the bio-oil from both residues increased with increase in temperatures. The density, viscosity and calorific value of the palm and physic residue oil are 831. 99 and 947. 5 kg/m 3, 0. 695 and 1. 58 cPa at room temperature, 22. 33 and 14. 169 kJ/g, respectively. Aromatics and other compounds are major dominant compounds in the palm <b>fruit</b> <b>fibre</b> oil which is characterized for bio-fuel production.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{possibility}} of using a composite material made from palm <b>fruit</b> <b>fibre</b> and sawdust as a building material, the modulus of elasticity, fracture load and the maximum deflection of mahogany sawdust and palm fruit fibre-kotolyn veneer composites have been determined using the static bending test. The sawdust particles were sieved into different particle sizes (d) : coarse (1. 1 mm≤d≤ 4. 8 mm), medium (0. 8 mm≤d≤ 1. 1 mm) and fine (d≤ 0. 8 mm). Briquettes were made from the sawdust of approximately same particle sizes mixed with palm fibre in different weights proportions, using ‘wood’ glue as a binder. The briquettes were then sandwiched between two pieces of Kotolyn veneer to form the composites. They were then subjected to bending tests. The composite materials made from 100 wt% of coarse size sawdust recorded the highest fracture load and modulus of elasticity of 48. 00 × 102 N and 2. 23 × 106 Nm- 2, respectively. Among the composites containing both fibre and sawdust, the 90 % wt coarse size- 10 wt% fibre recorded the highest fracture load and modulus of elasticity of 30. 90 × 102 N and 1. 07 × 106 Nm- 2. Mechanical strength of the composite decreased with decreasing fibre content. The maximum deflection, however, increased with increasing fibre content. The incorporation of fibre into the sawdust briquettes introduces some degree of flexibility into the composite materials with a decrease in the strength and doesn’t make good building material but can be used for domestic finishing’s...|$|E

In the cohort, 303 participants attended hospital with a new kidney stone episode. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and their 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). Compared to those with high intake of meat (> 100 g/day), the HR estimates for moderate meat-eaters (50 - 99 g/day), low meat-eaters (< 50 g/day), fish-eaters and vegetarians were 0. 80 (95 % CI 0. 57 - 1. 11), 0. 52 (95 % CI 0. 35 - 0. 8), 0. 73 (95 % CI 0. 48 - 1. 11) and 0. 69 (95 % CI 0. 48 - 0. 98), respectively. High intakes of fresh <b>fruit,</b> <b>fibre</b> from wholegrain cereals and magnesium were also associated with a lower risk of kidney stone formation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} intake of dietary fibre and whole grains and risk of colorectal cancer. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective observational studies. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and several other databases up to December 2010 and the reference lists of studies {{included in the analysis}} as well as those listed in published meta-analyses. STUDY SELECTION: Prospective cohort and nested case-control studies of dietary fibre or whole grain intake and incidence of colorectal cancer. RESULTS: 25 prospective studies were included in the analysis. The summary relative risk of developing colorectal cancer for 10 g daily of total dietary fibre (16 studies) was 0. 90 (95 % confidence interval 0. 86 to 0. 94, I(2) = 0 %), for <b>fruit</b> <b>fibre</b> (n= 9) was 0. 93 (0. 82 to 1. 05, I(2) = 23 %), for vegetable fibre (n= 9) was 0. 98 (0. 91 to 1. 06, I(2) = 0 %), for legume fibre (n= 4) was 0. 62 (0. 27 to 1. 42, I(2) = 58 %), and for cereal fibre (n= 8) was 0. 90 (0. 83 to 0. 97, I(2) = 0 %). The summary relative risk for an increment of three servings daily of whole grains (n= 6) was 0. 83 (0. 78 to 0. 89, I(2) = 18 %). CONCLUSION: A high intake of dietary fibre, in particular cereal fibre and whole grains, was associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.

The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the associations of total and food sources of dietary fibre with IHD mortality in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Heart study. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Participants were 306 331 men and women from eight European countries. Dietary fibre intake was assessed using centre or country-specific diet questionnaires and calibrated using a 24 -h diet recall. RESULTS: After an average follow-up of 11. 5 years, there were 2381 IHD deaths among participants without cardiovascular disease at baseline. The calibrated intake of dietary fibre was inversely related with IHD mortality; each 10 g/day was associated with a 15 % lower risk (relative risk (RR) 0. 85; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 73 - 0. 99, P = 0. 031). There was no difference in the associations of the individual food sources of dietary fibre with the risk of IHD mortality; RR for each 5 g/day higher cereal fibre intake was 0. 91 (CI: 0. 82 - 1. 01), RR for each 2. 5 g/day <b>fruit</b> <b>fibre</b> intake was 0. 94 (CI: 0. 88 - 1. 01) and RR for each 2. 5 g/day vegetable fibre intake was 0. 90 (95 % CI: 0. 76 - 1. 07).

30|$|Adsorption {{is a major}} {{industrial}} separation technique for the purification of effluent media. It is a mass transfer operation through which a solid material can selectively remove dissolved components from an aqueous solution by attracting the dissolved solute to its surface. Therefore, it involves the interphase accumulation of concentrated substances at a surface or at the interphase. This separation technique finds wide application in the removal of dye from aqueous media. Specifically, adsorption finds application in textile, leather, dyeing, cosmetics, plastics, food and paper industries where water recovery is very essential. To achieve and sustain efficient recovery of the desired water quality, a careful selection of adsorbent {{is of paramount importance}} (Abd El-Latif et al. 2010; Albarins and Hela 1993; Menkiti and Onukwuli 2011). However, the array of adsorbents available in our local markets is imported from other countries, in spite of the abundance of raw materials in Nigeria for the production of the required quantity of adsorbents for local industries (Menkiti and Onukwuli 2011). In literature, a number of adsorbents have been investigated for the removal of dyes from wastewater. Some examples amongst others include: apple pomace and wheat straw (Robinson et al. 2002); corncob and barley husk (Robinson et al. 2001); maize cob, wood and rice hull (Low and Lee 1997); banana stalk (Bello et al. 2012 a); groundnut hull (Bello et al. 2012 b; Din et al. 2009); oil palm ash (Foo and Hameed 2009 a; Hasan 2008); oil palm <b>fruit</b> <b>fibre</b> (Bello 2013); cocoa pod husks (Bello and Ahmad 2011 a); spent tea leaves (Hameed 2009 a); ginger waste (Ahmad and Kumar 2010); degreased coffee bean (Baek et al. 2010); mango peels (Bello and Ahmad 2011 b); rice husk (Foo and Hameed 2009 b; Yahaya et al. 2010 a, b, 2011 a, b); periwinkle shell (Bello et al. 2008; Bello and Ahmad 2011 c, d); palm kernel shell (Zawani et al. 2009); coconut shell (Bello and Ahmad 2012 b); Imperata cylindrica leaf (Bello and Semire 2012); rubber seed coat (Bello and Ahmad 2012 a); ackee apple (Blighia sapida) seeds (Bello et al. 2013 a); de-oiled soya (Mittal et al. 2005); cassava peel (Rajeshwarisivaraj et al. 2001); bean pods (Cabal et al. 2009); Luffa cylindrica fibres (Demir et al. 2008); papaya seeds (Hameed 2009 b); and fly ash (Bello et al. 2013 b).

Fibres from both peels {{had a high}} total dietary fibre content (61 - 69 %) with an appreciable amount of soluble fibre (19 - 22 %). The concentration of antioxidant [AA 50] required to achieve a 50 % inhibition of oxidation of linoleic acid at 40 °C was measured using the ferric-thiocyanate method. The higher the [AA 50], the lower the antioxidant capacity. Lime peel fibre [AA 50] was half the value of DL-α-tocopherol and 23 times lower than orange peel fibre; the [AA 50] of commercial butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) was half the value of lime fibre. HPLC analyses of the polyphenols extracted from orange and lime peels fibres showed the presence of caffeic and ferulic acids, as well as naringin, hesperidin and myricetin in both <b>fruit</b> <b>fibres.</b> The different antioxidant power of these fibres could be in part explained by the presence in lime peel fibre of ellagic acid, quercetin and kaempferol which are strong antioxidant polyphenols.

25|$|The {{district}} has a rich variety of plants ranging from rare orchids, medicinal plants and spices to hedge plants, tuber crops, plants yielding edible <b>fruits</b> and <b>fibre.</b> Aromatic plants and spices such as pepper and ginger are cultivated {{on a large}} scale on the hilly tracts. Nedumangad taluka {{is one of the biggest}} centres of cultivation and trade of pepper and other hill produce. A major portion of the district comes under the middle plain and the region is under the cultivation of coconut, rice, tapioca, tuber crops, plantains and vegetabless.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to compare some in vitro health- {{promoting}} properties in <b>fruit</b> dietary <b>fibre</b> (antioxidant activity, fermentability and glucose retardation index), which could be useful to predict their physiological effects better than physico-chemical analyses. These properties were evaluated in mango and lemon peel fibre. Mango fibre was better than lemon fibre because of the highest values of antioxidant activity (67 · 6 %) and glucose retardation index (21 · 5 %). Antioxidant activity is proposed as a new health-promoting property associated to dietary fibre. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Oil spill {{constitutes}} {{a major source}} of fresh and seawater pollution as a result of accidental discharge from tankers, marine engines, and underwater pipes. Therefore, the need for cost-effective and environmental friendly sorbent materials for oil spill cleanup cannot be overemphasized. The present work focuses on the preliminary study of empty palm <b>fruit</b> bunch <b>fibre</b> as a promising sorbent material. The morphology of the unmodified empty palm <b>fruit</b> bunch, EPFB <b>fibre,</b> was examined using an optical microcopy, scanning electron microcopy coupled with EDX and X-ray diffraction. The effects of oil volume, fibre weight, and time on oil absorption of EPFB fibre were evaluated with new engine oil from the model oil. The results show that EPFB fibre consists of numerous micro pores, hydrophobic, and partially crystalline and amorphous with approximately 13. 5 % carbon. The oil absorbency of the fibre increased with the increase in oil volume, immersion time, and fibre weight. However, sorption capacity decreased beyond 3 [*]g in 100 [*]mL. Additionally unmodified EPFB fibre showed optimum oil sorption efficiency of approximately 2. 8 [*]g/g within three days of immersion time...|$|R
