40|$|Foil {{bearings}} {{were designed}} and fabricated to replace pivoted-shoe journal bearings in a Brayton cycle turboalternator, within space limitations and constraints {{imposed by the}} existing machine. The foil bearings were integrated into a unified assembly with the rotor, <b>housing,</b> <b>seals,</b> and gimbal-mounted thrust bearing, without changes and modifications of machine components other than the journal bearings. The gas-lubricated foil bearings, which require no external pressure-source, furnished a stable support for a 21. 9 pound rotor in the vertical attitude at speeds to 43, 200 rpm. Excellent wipe-wear characteristics permitted well over 1000 start-stop cycles, without deterioration of performance in the entire speed range. The paper reviews salient aspects of design, fabrication, and performance. An account is given of rotor dynamics during starting, stopping, and traversing the region of resonances. The state of journal and foil surfaces is examined following intensive start-stop cycling and high-speed runs over extended periods of time...|$|E
40|$|Industry {{sources have}} {{reported}} that over 90 percent of all rolling element bearings will not reach their projected design life. Millions will fail prematurely each year from such causes as dirt and moisture contamination. The overwhelming majority of these failures could be prevented {{through the use of}} appropriately engineered, properly selected, and suitably installed bearing <b>housing</b> <b>seals.</b> Associated savings in labor, materials, and energy would accrue due to extended oil change intervals and a portion of the energy savings component in this equation would consist of lubricant manufacturing cost avoidance. A second, significant portion would be {{associated with the use of}} synthetic lubricants. It has been ascertained that utilization of synthetic lubes would become far more practical if oil drain intervals could be extended. This paper reviews the shortcomings of traditional bearing housing sealing methods and explains available, cost-effective aerospace-derived state-of-art solutions which have proven to meet the objectives of hermetically sealing bearing housings on the widest possible spectrum of rotating machinery in virtually every industry...|$|E
