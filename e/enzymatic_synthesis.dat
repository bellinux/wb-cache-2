However, the transportation process also faces the challenges of asphaltene-paraffin structural interactions, pipeline pressure losses and energy consumption. In order to determine the role of drag-reducing surfactant additives in the transportation of crude oils, experiments of wax deposition inhibition and drag reduction of different oil in pipelines with a biobased surfactant obtained by <b>enzymatic</b> <b>syntheses</b> were carried out. The results indicated that heavy oil transportation in the pipeline is remarkably enhanced by creating stable oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion with the surfactant additive. The wax appearance temperature (WAT) and pour point were modified, and the formation of a space-filling network of interlocking wax crystals was prevented at low temperature by adding a small concentration of the surfactant additive. A maximum viscosity reduction of 70 % and a drag reduction of 40 % for light crude oil flows in pipelines were obtained with the surfactant additive at a concentration of 100 mg/L. Furthermore, a successful field application of the drag-reducing surfactant in a light crude oil pipeline in Daqing Oilfield was demonstrated. Hence, the use of biobased surfactant obtained by <b>enzymatic</b> <b>syntheses</b> in oil transportation is a potential method to address the current challenges, which could result in a significant energy savings and a considerable reduction of the operating cost...|$|R

One synthetic development has been the application of bio-transformations to nucleoside syntheses. This topic has been reviewed recently (Shirae et al., 1991) but this review is not widely available. In the present review, the application of biotechnology to the synthesis of antiviral agents including those which are not nucleoside analogues will be discussed. <b>Enzymatic</b> <b>syntheses</b> of nucleosides can be simpler and quicker than syntheses carried out by chemical methods. The most useful enzymes are those found in catabolic pathways. Nucleoside phosphorylases and N-deoxyribosyltransferases have both been widely used for nucleoside synthesis catalysing the transfer of sugar residues from a donor nucleoside to a heterocyclic base. Enzymatic methods have also been applied to the resolution of racemic mixtures and adensoine deaminase is a convenient catalyst for the hydrolysis of amino groups on purines and purine analogues. Regioselective deprotection of nucleoside esters has been achieved with lipases and these enzymes have also been applied to the synthesis of esters of sugar-like alkaloids.

50|$|Biocatalysis, a.k.a. {{biotransformation}} and bioconversion, {{makes use}} of natural or modified isolated enzymes, enzyme extracts, or whole-cell systems for enhancing the production of small molecules. It has much to offer compared to traditional organic synthesis. The syntheses are shorter, less energy intensive and generate less waste and hence, are both environmentally and economically more attractive. About 2/3 of chiral products produced on large industrial scale are already made using biocatalysis. In the manufacture of fine chemicals, enzymes represent {{the single most important}} technology for radical cost reductions. This is particularly the case in the synthesis of molecules with chiral centres. Here, it is possible to substitute the formation of a salt with a chiral compound, e.g., (+)-α-phenylethylamine, crystallization, salt breaking and recycling of the chiral auxiliary, resulting in a theoretical yield of not more than 50%, with a one step, high yield reaction under mild conditions and resulting in a product with a very high enantiomeric excess (ee).

Currently, the main modes of production for specific flavor peptides such as BMP are chemical and <b>enzymatic</b> <b>synthesis,</b> both of which involve high production costs. In 2010, a group of researchers attempted to solve the production cost through recombination DNA technology. The intended goal of the experiment was to use recombination to produce the “delicious peptide” in Pichia pastoris, a type of yeast cell that could be grown on a large-scale level through fermentation. However, the technique yielded low levels of BMP. Analysis showed that transformants that were able to utilize methanol effectively generally yielded higher BMP production, which suggests a relationship between the regulatory mechanism of BMP and methanol.|$|E
