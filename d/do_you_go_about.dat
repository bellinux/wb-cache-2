2500|$|Within {{weeks of}} Fireballs release, the band were already {{performing}} songs {{planned for the}} next album. One song (which later became [...] "Highway Star") was performed at the first gig of the Fireball tour, having been written on the bus to a show in Portsmouth, in answer to a journalist's question: [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> writing songs?" [...] Three months later, in December 1971, the band travelled to Switzerland to record Machine Head. The album was due to be recorded at the Montreux Casino, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, but a fire during a Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention gig, caused by a man firing a flare gun into the ceiling, burned down the Casino. This incident famously inspired the song [...] "Smoke on the Water". The album was later recorded in a corridor at the nearby empty Grand Hotel.|$|E

Well," [...] {{he said aloud}} to himself, [...] "as I am a sinful saint, if I hadn't seen where the voice came from, I could have sworn it was her; just as we taught her to sing it by the river there, I and William Penberthy of Marazion, my good comrade. The Lord have mercy on me!" ...|$|E

Poor girl! why should she break her heart when a decent fellow like you will only be too glad to make her a happy woman?" [...] And {{in this way the}} earl talked to Eames till the latter almost {{believed}} that the difficulties were vanishing from out of his path. [...] "Could it be possible," [...] he asked himself, as he went to bed, [...] "that in a fortnight's time Lily Dale should have accepted him as her future husband?" [...] Then he remembered that day on which Crosbie, with the two girls, had called at his mother's house, when in the bitterness of his heart, he had sworn to himself that he would always regard Crosbie as his enemy. Since then the world had gone well with him; and he had no longer any bitter feeling against Crosbie. That matter had been arranged on the platform of the Paddington Station. He felt that if Lily would now accept him he could almost shake hands with Crosbie. The episode in his life and in Lily's would have been painful; but he would learn to look back upon that without regret, if Lily could be taught to believe that a kind fate had at last given her to the better of her two lovers. [...] "I'm afraid she won't bring herself to forget him," [...] he had said to the earl. [...] "She'll only be too happy to forget him," [...] the earl had answered, [...] "if you can induce her to begin the attempt. Of course it is very bitter at first;--all the world knew about it; but, poor girl, she is not to be wretched for ever, because of that. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> your work with some little confidence, and I doubt not but what you'll have your way. You have everybody in your favour,--the squire, her mother, and all." [...] While such words as these were in his ears how could he fail to hope and to be confident? While he was sitting cosily over his bedroom fire he resolved that it should be as the earl had said. But when he got up on the following morning, and stood shivering as he came out of his bath, he could not feel the same confidence. [...] "Of course I shall go to her," [...] he said to himself, [...] "and make a plain story of it. But I know what her answer will be. She will tell me that she cannot forget him." [...] Then his feelings towards Crosbie were not so friendly as they had been on the previous evening.|$|E

I hear that when the first two courses came back to the kitchen practically untouched, his feelings were so hurt that he cried like a child. And {{when the rest of the}} dinner followed, he came to the conclusion that the whole thing was a studied and calculated insult, and decided to hand in his portfolio." ...|$|R

"That {{adds to the}} difficulty," [...] Archie said thoughtfully; [...] "but I {{must think}} of some plan to {{overcome}} it. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> quietly <b>go</b> <b>about</b> among those <b>you</b> can surely trust and arrange {{for them to be}} ready to open their doors and take my men in without the slightest noise which might attract the sentries on the walls.

You were made, body and mind, in a more delicate mould, and for something better.

You needn't take my word for that, and I don't suppose you've noticed it, but that's what Mr. Gossip in the Morning Mirror called me when he was writing about my getting engaged to Derek. My maid showed me the clipping. There was quite a long paragraph, with a picture of me that looked like a Zulu chieftainess taken in a coal-cellar during a bad fog.

50|$|Mann {{made his}} directorial debut with the TV movie The Jericho Mile. This was partly shot in Folsom Prison. Mann says that {{influenced}} {{the writing of}} Thief:It probably informed my ability to imagine what Frank’s life was like, where he was from, and what those 12 or 13 years in prison were like for him.. The idea of creating his character, was to have somebody who has been outside of society. An outsider who {{has been removed from}} the evolution of everything from technology to the music that people listen to, to how you talk to a girl, to what do you want with your life and how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> getting it. Everything that’s normal development, that we experience, he was excluded from, by design. In the design of the character and the engineering of the character, that was the idea.Mann made James Caan do research as a thief for his role.I always find it interesting, people who are aware, alert, conscious of what they do and are pretty good at it… People who want to put in 50-60 hours a week and go home and are not really conscious of life moving by, don’t really interest me very much... As part of the curriculum designed for an actor getting into character, I try to imagine what’s going to really help bring this actor more fully into character. And so I try to imagine what experiences are going to make more dimensional his intake of Frank, so that he is Frank spontaneously when I’m shooting. So one of the most obvious things is it’d be pretty good if Caan was as good at doing what Frank does as is Frank.Jerry Bruckheimer and Ronnie Caan served as the film's producers.|$|E
