50|$|After seeds germinate, {{they produce}} a {{haustorium}} or root-like structures that penetrate the host to extract water and minerals. This endophytic portion {{results in a}} challenging control problem because treatments must kill the outer <b>ectophytic</b> portion of the plant {{as well as the}} endophytic portion without damaging the host.|$|E
50|$|O. mangiferae {{appears in}} spring, from December through March, and primary {{inoculum}} comes either from wind borne conidia from other infection sites, or from surviving inoculum and mycelia on the tree. Powdery mildew is most prevalent in cool, dry years, and secondary infections also occur from wind dispersed conidia. The disease is highly polycyclic, with the pathogen life cycle from germination to conidiation taking only 9 days, and conidia infecting the plant tissues 5-7 hours after germination. Warm temperatures with cloud cover and heavy dew promote infection, though dry conditions favor disease development. The fungus overwinters in infected leaves and malformed inflorescences {{in the form}} of dormant mycelium, conidiophores or conidia. This fungus is <b>ectophytic,</b> existing primarily on the surface of plant tissues. It draws nutrients from the plant via haustoria that penetrate the epidermal layer. This pathogen is also biotrophic, surviving only on live plant tissues. As such, growth of the pathogen ceases when the tissue it occupies becomes necrotic. Conidia germinate between 9 and 30.5 degrees Celsius, with an optimal temperature of 22 degrees. Atmospheric temperatures of 10-31 degrees Celsius are the optimum for development of the disease on mango trees. Disease development is inversely proportional to the number of hours of sunshine per day, and moderate to high relative humidity also plays a role in the severity of infections. Powdery mildew infections show a characteristic white or gray powdery growth on various plant surfaces, including leaves, flower scales, buds, axils, stalks, and fruits. If the white outer growth is removed or disturbed, the disease appears as purple-brown blotches on older leaves and fruit. Infection may also cause distortion of young leaves, as the infection usually begins {{on the underside of the}} leaf. Necrotic lesions appear on the upper side of the leaf, and the leaves tend to curl downward. The disease is often of most concern and causes the most damage when it is present on flowers, inflorescences and fruit. When infections occur, Oidium mangiferae may cause premature shedding of flowers and fruit, often before fruits reach the size of peas or prior to flower fertilization. This causes a severe decline in fruit yield and crop commercial return. Blossoms are most susceptible to infection at the point that flowers are just beginning to open on the panicles. Infected fruits turn a yellow color and may become misshapen. The conidia produce germ tubes, which develop into hook-like appressoria that are used for cuticle penetration. Penetration pegs develop into tubular haustoria, which later swell and become globular. O. mangiferae produces septate, hyaline conidia that range from barrel shaped to elliptical. Germ tube length is dependent on relative humidity, and hyphal cells are 40-80 μm long.|$|E
40|$|Ectendomeliola is {{characterized}} by its <b>ectophytic</b> and endophytic appressoria was known with its type, E. walsurae. The recent collection on an endemic plant from the Western Ghats region of Kerala revealed the second species, E. otonephelii, differs from the type species in having longer mycelial setae with acute to furcate tip and larger perithecia, is described and illustrated here in detail...|$|E
40|$|Symptoms {{resembling}} {{powdery mildew}} appeared on spinach crops during April andMay in 2007. Infected plants have suppressed growth, smaller and degenerated youngleaves. The affected leaves become yellowish and wilt {{in a short}} time. High temperaturesand draught conditions cause drying out of the affected plants. The symptoms are similarto physiological degeneration but are found on single plants or on small groups of plants. When plants are carefully examined, fine, exogenic mycelium is found on the leave blades. The mycelium can be clearly seen close to the main veins where it becomes denser andforms mycelium patches. On the leaf and flower stalks and plant stems the mycelium iswhite and fine at the beginning, and later becomes grayish. Under microscope analysis <b>ectophytic</b> mycelia of exogenic origin and short chainsof spores are observed. On short conidiophores, chains with two types of conidia areformed: macro conidia that are one-celled, colorless, thin-walled, elliptical to cylindrical,sized 24. 5 - 28. 4 x 17. 5 μm; and micro conidia – ovoid to elliptical, sized 10. 4 - 14. 1 x 7. 7 μm. Teleomorphs are found in groups or as a single structure mainly close to the leaf veins. Theyare roundish and have appendages with uncinate-circinate to helicoids apex, sized - 87. 5 - 150 μm. Cleistothecia have 4 - 5 to 8 asci (68. 0 x 38. 0 μm), with 4 to 8 elliptical ascospores,sized 15. 5 - 22. 0 х 11. 0 - 17. 5 μm. The causal agent of powdery mildew on spinach found inBulgaria {{has been identified as}} Uncinula spp. (Sawadaea spp.), Euoidium type anamorph,subspecies spinaciae...|$|E
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequences of}} the nuclear ribosomal DNA including 18 S, 5. 8 S, and 28 S rDNA and the internal transcribed spacer regions were determined for 33 powdery mildew taxa spanning 15 genera to infer the phylogenetic relationships for these fungi. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Uncinula septata {{was placed in the}} primitive base to the large clade composed of all other powdery mildew taxa. Powdery mildews excluding Unc. septata were split into five major lineages. The Pseudoidium lineage consisted of six genera, i. e., Erysiphe, Microsphaera, Uncinula, Uncinuliella, Brasiliomyces, and Typhulochaeta, all of which are characterized by polyascal cleistothecia and Pseudoidium-type anamorph. The Eudoidium lineage consisted of three Erysiphe species (E. cichoracearum, E. orontii and E. galeopsidis) and Arthrocladiella mougeotii, which are characterized by polyascal cleistothecia and Euoidium-type anamorph. The endophytic lineage consisted of two Phyllactinia species (Phy. moricola and Phy. kakicola), Leveillula taurica and Pleochaeta shiraiana, which are characterized by the presence of endophytic or partly endophytic mycelia. The fibrosin lineage consisted of the genera Sawadaea, Cystotheca, Podosphaera, and Sphaerotheca, all of which are characterized by the presence of well-developed fibrosin bodies in the conidia and conidiophores. The monocot lineage consisted of a single species, Blumeria graminis, which is well characterized by being parasitic to monocots, especially to cereal plants. Character polarization was discussed on several major characteristics. The mycelioid appendage which has long been regarded as an ancestral character may be a derived character {{as a result of an}} event that may have occurred multiple times independently due to convergence. Euoidium-type anamorph and clavate appressorial germ tube are considered to be ancestral characters to Pseudoidium-type anamorph and lobed germ tube. <b>Ectophytic</b> nature and polyascal cleistothecia are also regarded as ancestral features to endophytic nature and monoascal cleistothecia...|$|E
