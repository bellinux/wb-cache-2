5|$|<b>Exportation</b> of merinos without royal {{permission}} {{was also}} a punishable offense, thus ensuring a near-absolute monopoly on the breed until the mid-18th century. After {{the breaking of the}} export ban, fine wool sheep began to be distributed worldwide. The export to Rambouillet by Louis XVI in 1786 formed the basis for the modern Rambouillet (or French Merino) breed. After the Napoleonic Wars and the global distribution of the once-exclusive Spanish stocks of Merinos, sheep raising in Spain reverted to hardy coarse-wooled breeds such as the Churra, and was no longer of international economic significance.|$|E

5|$|Sheep are an {{important}} part of the global agricultural economy. However, their once vital status has been largely replaced by other livestock species, especially the pig, chicken, and cow. China, Australia, India, and Iran have the largest modern flocks, and serve both local and <b>exportation</b> needs for wool and mutton. Other countries such as New Zealand have smaller flocks but retain a large international economic impact due to their export of sheep products. Sheep also play a major role in many local economies, which may be niche markets focused on organic or sustainable agriculture and local food customers. Especially in developing countries, such flocks may be a part of subsistence agriculture rather than a system of trade. Sheep themselves may be a medium of trade in barter economies.|$|E
5|$|The Rathores, {{traditional}} {{rulers of}} the Marwar region of western India, {{were the first to}} breed the Marwari. Beginning in the 12th century, they espoused strict breeding that promoted purity and hardiness. Used throughout history as a cavalry horse by the people of the Marwar region, the Marwari was noted for its loyalty and bravery in battle. The breed deteriorated in the 1930s, when poor management practices resulted in a reduction of the breeding stock, but today has regained some of its popularity. The Marwari is used for light draught and agricultural work, as well as riding and packing. In 1995, a breed society was formed for the Marwari in India. The <b>exportation</b> of Marwaris was banned for decades, but between 2000 and 2006, a small number of exports were allowed. Since 2008, visas allowing temporary travel of Marwaris outside India have been available in small numbers.|$|E
5|$|The major cereal crops of {{the ancient}} Mediterranean region were wheat, emmer, and barley, while common {{vegetables}} included peas, beans, fava, and olives, dairy products came mostly from sheep and goats, and meat, which was consumed on rare occasion for most people, usually consisted of pork, beef, and lamb. Agriculture in ancient Greece was hindered by the topography of mainland Greece that only allowed for roughly 10% of the land to be cultivated properly, necessitating the specialized <b>exportation</b> of oil and wine and importation of grains from Thrace (centered {{in what is now}} Bulgaria) and the Greek colonies of southern Russia. During the Hellenistic period, the Ptolemaic Empire controlled Egypt, Cyprus, Phoenicia, and Cyrenaica, major grain-producing regions that mainland Greeks depended on for subsistence, while the Ptolemaic grain market also {{played a critical role in}} the rise of the Roman Republic. In the Seleucid Empire, Mesopotamia was a crucial area for the production of wheat, while nomadic animal husbandry was also practiced in other parts.|$|E

5|$|Environmental {{conditions}} on the island also worsened under Rajoelina. The illegal <b>exportation</b> of endangered rosewood from protected national forests abruptly increased under the HAT, with several business leaders and politicians linked to the HAT having been implicated in trafficking the valuable wood to China; NGOs and the US government accused the Rajoelina administration of selling the wood to supplement the national budget and finance its public works projects. A large, unexplained stash of rosewood logs was discovered at the presidential palace {{after the end of}} Rajoelina's term in office. Due to accelerating deforestation and a spike in bush meat consumption linked with deepening poverty, the island's lemurs moved closer toward extinction under Rajoelina's tenure. A July 2012 assessment found that 90percent of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction, an increase from 38 percent in 2008. Lack of funds for pesticides and systematic spraying resulted in the March 2013 outbreak of a locust infestation that was anticipated to persist for five to ten years and require $41 million U.S. dollars to bring under control, deepening the risk of nationwide famine and destruction of habitat for endangered species.|$|E

5|$|Prior to , {{a flourishing}} trade route for Percherons existed between Nogent-le-Rotrou, Le Havre and the United States. However, {{after the war}} began, an embargo was placed on French Percherons, disallowing them from <b>exportation.</b> Other than an {{exception}} in April 1916 to allow 59 horses to be shipped from France to the US, this embargo remained in place {{until the end of}} the war. The war took its toll on the Percheron breed as horses, fodder, and handlers were requisitioned for the fighting, and even after the embargo was lifted France did not have the quality or quantity of stock to fulfill the needs of American breeders. The embargo created a breeding boom in the US, replacing the previous practice of importing the majority of Percherons from France, and late in the war horses were shipped the other way– from the US to Europe– to supply those needed in the war. The lack of feathering on the Percheron's lower legs made them easier to care for in the mud that they often worked in during wartime. Their quick trot on paved roads made them more versatile than motorized vehicles, and they were useful for work with guns and in forward units due to their calm temperaments.|$|E

5|$|Tantalum is {{considered}} a conflict resource. Coltan, the industrial name for a columbite–tantalite mineral from which columbium (i.e. niobium) and tantalum are extracted, {{can also be found}} in Central Africa, which is why tantalum is being linked to warfare in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). According to an October 23, 2003 United Nations report, the smuggling and <b>exportation</b> of coltan has helped fuel the war in the Congo, a crisis that has resulted in approximately 5.4 million deaths since 1998 – making it the world’s deadliest documented conflict since World War II. Ethical questions have been raised about responsible corporate behavior, human rights, and endangering wildlife, due to the exploitation of resources such as coltan in the armed conflict regions of the Congo Basin. However, although important for the local economy in Congo, the contribution of coltan mining in Congo to the world supply of tantalum is usually small. The United States Geological Survey reports in its yearbook that this region produced a little less than 1% of the world's tantalum output in 2002–2006, peaking at 10% in 2000 and 2008.|$|E

According to Saudi officials, about 900 new homes are needed a day to meet the demand of the rapidly growing population, which has nearly quadrupled in the past four decades. Jeddah Tower is also an attempt to diversify Saudi Arabia's economy, which, holding a quarter of the world's oil reserves and being one of the founding OPEC nations, is currently largely dependent on its crude oil <b>exportation,</b> which accounts for nearly 75% of government revenues and 90% of exports.

5|$|This {{species was}} seldom seen in captivity before the late 1950s, after which time {{a large number}} of wild-caught birds entered the Australian market. Since then, it has become more common, but is still rarely seen outside Australia. Captive yellow-tailed black {{cockatoos}} require a large aviary to avoid apathy and poor health. There is some evidence that protein may be more important to them than to other cockatoos, and low protein has been linked with the production of yolkless eggs in captivity. Females in particular enjoy mealworms. They can be placid and tolerate sharing an enclosure with smaller parrots, but do not handle disturbance while breeding. As with other black cockatoos, yellow-tailed black cockatoos are rarely seen in European zoos, since Australia restricted <b>exportation</b> of wildlife in 1959, but birds seized by government agencies in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have been loaned to zoos that are members of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). In 2000, there were pairs of yellow-tailed black cockatoos in Puerto de la Cruz zoo in Spain and in Rotterdam. Like most species of parrots, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, the French stud {{book was}} changed to include draft types from other areas of France that were {{closely related to the}} Percheron– {{including}} the horses of Berrichon, Nivernais, Marne, Augeron, Bourbonnais, Loire and Saône-et-Loire. French Percherons were also hit hard by the advent of mechanization, and between 1970 and 1990 focus was placed on breeding horses of greater mass for the meat market. The largest and heaviest stallions were selected for breeding. Beginning at the 1989 World Percheron Congress, French breeders realized that they needed a lighter breed for tourism, export to Japan for draft work, and other markets. In 1993, a trend of importing American stallions to France was started with the black stallion Silver Shadows Sheik. This stallion and others were used to create a more elegant, smaller and sleeker look in the French Percheron, while still retaining the traditional bone and foot structure. All the imported stallions were black, reviving the popularity of black Percherons in France. French breeders continue to import American-bred Percheron stallions in order to produce lighter foals, moving away from the heavier meat-type horses of the late 20th century. Also in 1993, the Société Hippique Percheronne anticipated the increasing tourist and <b>exportation</b> markets by prohibiting docking, which was not prohibited for other draft breeds until 1996. This was partly {{at the request of the}} Germans, and partly due to the influence of magazines such as Cheval.|$|E
5|$|During the 1820s, Duyệt's {{continued}} cultivated {{of relations}} with the immigrant Chinese community that had settled in southern Vietnam in large numbers brought him into conflict with Minh Mạng. The general had adopted a Chinese immigrant merchant as his son and gave him favours, including appointing him to position {{of the body that}} regulated trade. The Japanese historian Shimao concluded that Duyệt and his entourage were given financial rewards and gifts from the Chinese merchants in return for favourable treatment by government officials. It was also pointed out that another of Duyet's men was himself a businessman who had a Chinese agent. At the time, southern Vietnam was producing rice in plentiful quantities but export was banned by Minh Mạng, but prices in Vietnam, which were lower than those overseas, kept rising by 50–100% {{in various parts of the}} country in five years. In the meantime, the opium supply kept on increasing. It was thought that Chinese merchants, whom Duyệt patronised, were illegally exporting rice at higher prices, and then bringing back opium during return journeys along with incoming immigrants. For his part, the general disagreed with the prevailing view held by the emperor, and said that people of both races were engaging in illegal trading, as well as blaming the incoming immigrants' personal addictions rather than the Chinese merchants for bringing in opium. The historian Nola Cooke said that Duyet's viewpoint was more plausible and speculated that the emperor's stance was borne more out of a fear of the consequences of a disproportionate Chinese influence on the country than the reality of illegal trading. Duyệt wanted to further give tax concessions to newly arrived Chinese immigrants that were deemed to be impoverished to encourage immigration and speed up development of the region, something that the emperor was sceptical of, on the reasoning that it was difficult to genuinely determine who was in need and that the concession system was therefore open to rorting. Nevertheless, Duyệt disobeyed Minh Mạng and tax concessions were granted. Because of their involvement in the illegal <b>exportation</b> of rice and importation of opium, Minh Mạng tried to ban the Chinese from engaging in sea trade in 1827, but this was easily circumvented by the merchants, who exploited their contacts with Duyệt and used fraudulent registrations, often under the name of Vietnamese wives. It was not until Duyệt died that Minh Mạng was able to crack down on fraudulent sea trade.|$|E

This article search evidences that can help to answer this question. The article measure the impact on the Brazilian <b>exportations</b> of an average increase in one variable that affects the propensity to the technological innovation of the firm, the schooling of workers used in the companies, and of an average increase in the scale efficiency. The empirical results of this article have information for firms and suggest that the companies who carry through technological innovation have 16 % more possibilities to be exporting of that the firms that do not make innovations. The increase of 20 % in the efficiency of scale of the average of the firms in the Brazilian industry, would increase in 4, 2 % the probability of the firm to be an exporter. Simulations taking as base the results of the model suggest that 81. 6 % of the increase of the resultant <b>exportations</b> of positive variations in the efficiency of scale and the propensity to carry through technological innovation of the firm would be resultant of the <b>exportations</b> of the firms that they do not export and that they would start to export.
