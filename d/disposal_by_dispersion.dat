40|$|The {{study of}} {{clothing}} disposal systems, involving {{the flow of}} clothing from one household to another, is of great interest because of the positive social and environmental consequences. Based on 35 in-depth interviews with adult {{men and women in}} Ecuador, a Latin American country, the authors sought to expand knowledge regarding one of these systems: clothing <b>disposal</b> <b>by</b> gifting to family, friends, and acquaintances. The respondents’ narratives indicated that the clothing <b>disposal</b> system <b>by</b> gifting is noncentric; based on social exchange, it strengthens the links between givers and recipients while allowing for clothes to circulate for a longer time. The data also indicated an intersection between age and gender, offering insight into how the process of clothing <b>disposal</b> <b>by</b> gifting develops within households. In some <b>disposal</b> events reported <b>by</b> participants, the clothing <b>disposal</b> system <b>by</b> gifting demonstrated autonomy, but in other events, it interacted with the clothing marketing system.
