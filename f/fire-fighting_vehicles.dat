5000|$|LPM-2 - A more {{extensive}} conversion of a BMP-1 into a civil <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{to be used}} against strong forest and peat fires. Development started in 1995. The LPM-2 has a new larger superstructure with a 5000-litre water-tank and {{is equipped with a}} NShN-600N fire pump, one main firehose from the ATs-40(131)137 fire fighting vehicle and two remote firehoses, a PKL-70 mounted ditching plow and a R-123M VHF radio. The suspension on the BMP-1 was changed significantly, ground clearance was increased to 480 mm and the vehicle weighs 18.5 tonnes (with water). It has a crew of two (plus four firefighters). The LPM-2 won a Gold Medal in an exhibition of fire-fighting equipment in Brussels. Cyprus has planned to order some of these vehicles while Turkey has already purchased a quantity (Turkish specialists installed two Czech IFEX firehoses and new doors). It is produced by the 140th Tank Repair Workshop.|$|R
30|$|Poor, short-lived, and {{intermittent}} connectivity will {{be provided}} to users on vehicles by negatively affecting the overall performance of vehicular applications. Therefore, further connectivity solutions need to be explored: special vehicles (e.g., police cars, highway assistance or <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>vehicles,</b> public transportation means like buses or trams) and private cars could share their Internet access and act as gateways toward the Internet.|$|E
40|$|In this study, it {{has been}} purposed to share {{practice}} of event-scene administration, search and rescue and evacuation of injured and acquired experiences carried out throughout a building collapse. After an explosion at Diyarbakir Kurdoglu housings at 11 December 2006 about 08 : 20 AM, five flats of an apartment that has five floors-ten flats were collapsed. Local military hospital ambulances, city ambulances, and <b>fire-fighting</b> <b>vehicles</b> arrived to event-place 10 minutes later. It has been found out that there were 13 people inside, 6 of which were children. Army rescue team arrived event-place about 01 : 30 PM, then all non-professional persons has been sent away from region. Eight dead including five children, and five injured including one child have been taken out. Two people from close area have been also injured mildly due to the explosion. It has been found out that accident caused by boiler tank exploding. Sixth of total eight injured had only superficial wounds. Other two injured have been followed because of head trauma at first one and hepatic contusion and rib fracture at the other one. No complication observed after follow-up. Building collapses can create disaster potential according {{to the number of}} people inside and facilities of nearby region of the place accident taken place. The evaluation of the direction of building collapse during search and rescue operation would enhance possibility to reach more living in shorter time. Building collapses which can be considered as a miniature of big disaster potentials like earthquakes can be appraised as an important practical training and experience source on event-place administration, search and rescue operations and injured evacuation. We believe that share of the analysis and acquired experiences of this kind of studies would contribute interfering big disaster potentials. [TAF Prev Med Bull 2012; 11 (2. 000) : 241 - 244...|$|E
