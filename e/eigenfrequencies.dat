[...] The Sun's rotation creates an equatorial bulge, which, along with other aspherical perturbations such as sunspots, break that symmetry, and lift the degeneracy. Therefore, in general the frequencies [...] of stellar oscillations depend on all three quantum numbers , [...] and [...] It is convenient to separate the frequency into the multiplet frequency , the uniformly weighted average over , corresponding to the spherically symmetric structure of the star, and the frequency splitting , which is determined by the asphericity.|$|E

If the excitation frequency {{of a given}} hydraulic system {{is equal to the}} system <b>eigenfrequency,</b> high-amplitude pressure and flow pulsations can arise.

2500|$|The {{secondary}} assembly was {{the actual}} SHRIMP {{component of the}} weapon. The weapon, like most contemporary weapons at that time, bore the same code-name as the secondary. The secondary was situated in the cylindrical end of the device, where its end was locked to the radiation case by a type of mortise and tenon joint. The hohlraum at its cylindrical end had an internal projection, which nested the secondary and had better structural strength to support the secondary's assembly, which had most of the device's mass. A visualisation to {{this is that the}} joint looked much like a cap (the secondary) fitted in a cone (the projection of the radiation case). Any other supporting structure would cause radiation transfer blockade and complex vibrational behavior. With this form of joint, the secondary and the hohlraum behaved as a single mass sharing common eigenvalues (<b>eigenfrequencies</b> and eigenmodes). The other end of the radiation case was shaped like a parabola to focus the radiation emitted by the fission device. The secondary assembly was an elongated truncated cone. From its front part to its aft section it was steeply tapered. Tapering was used for two reasons. First, radiation drops sharply by distance, as a function divided by the square of the distance, and radiation coupling is relatively poor. This made the use of a higher mass of the then scarce fusion fuel in the rear end of the secondary assembly inefficient and the whole device wasteful. This was also the reason why the lower-enriched slugs of fusion fuel were placed far aft of the fuel capsule. Second, as the primary could not illuminate the whole surface of the hohlraum, in part due to the large axial length of the secondary, relatively small solid angles would be effective to compress the secondary, leading to poor radiation focusing. By tapering, the hohlraum acted in a form of a quasi-parabola in its aft section without having to machine the radiation case to a parabola at both ends, amplifying the radiation focusing and enabling a streamlined production line, as it was cheaper, faster and easier to manufacture the radiation case with only one parabolic end. The tapering in this design was much steeper than its cousins, the RUNT, and the ALARM CLOCK devices. SHRIMP's tapering apparently made the whole secondary assembly resemble the body of a shrimp. The secondary's length is defined by the two pairs of dark-colored diagnostic hot spot pipes attached to the middle and left section of the device. These pipe sections [...] in diameter by [...] long were butt-welded end-to-end to the ballistic case leading out {{to the top of the}} shot cab. They would carry the initial reaction's light up to the array of 12 mirror towers built in an arc on the artificial [...] shot island created for the event. From those pipes, mirrors would reflect early bomb light from the bomb casing to a series of remote high-speed cameras, so that Los Alamos could determine both the simultaneity of the design (i.e. the time interval between primary's firing and secondary's ignition) and the thermonuclear burn rate in these two crucial areas of the secondary device.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the radiation process of the charged particle passing through an external periodic field in a dispersive medium. In the optical range of spectrum we will consider two cases: first, the source has not <b>eigenfrequency,</b> and second, the source has <b>eigenfrequency.</b> In the first case, when the Cherenkov radiation occurs, the non-zero <b>eigenfrequency</b> produces a paradox for Doppler effect. It is shown that the absence of the <b>eigenfrequency</b> solves the paradox known in the literature. The question whether the process is normal (i. e. hard photons are being radiated under the small angles) or anomalous depends on the law of the medium dispersion. When the source has an <b>eigenfrequency</b> the Doppler effects can be either normal or anomalous. In the X-ray range of the oscillator radiation spectrum we have two photons radiated under the same angle- soft and hard. In this case the radiation obeys to so-called complicated Doppler effect, i. e. in the soft photon region we have anomalous Doppler effect and in the hard photon region we have normal Doppler effect.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of compliances near cut-outs of space structures demand for local reinforcement with laminate doublers {{in order to}} satisfy the specifications concerning the <b>eigenfrequency.</b> The placement of such layers can be found in an automated optimization routine. A new methodology named the Ghost Layer Concept is proposed. Ghost Layers are virtual laminate layers with defined material and orientation angle but no thickness. These layers influence neither stiffness- nor mass matrix and thus do not change the structural behaviour of the model. However, a Sensitivity Analysis can be performed for both, Ghost Layers and regular layers, by deriving the <b>eigenfrequency</b> with respect to layers thicknesses. The gradient indicates which layers of which elements have to be thickened in order to increase the <b>eigenfrequency</b> of the overall structure. Since the mass depends linearly on the element thicknesses, the gradient provides information how to increase the <b>eigenfrequency</b> with smallest mass growth possible. Introducing an arbitrary number of Ghost Layers and thickening the layers with maximal gradient value in an iterative procedure generates doublers. Tests have shown that good solutions can be found in short time. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the Helmholtz {{resonator}} geometry influence on its <b>eigenfrequency</b> is investigated using acoustic calculations. To perform acoustic calculations the {{finite element method}} was used. First of all, ANSYS software was {{used to create a}} resonator geometry model using finite elements of a certain size and shape. Thus, we used non-uniform partitioning of the model into finite elements. A more detailed partitioning was done {{in the vicinity of the}} resonator neck. Then, the resulting configuration was imported in SYSNOISE program to perform acoustic calculations. The calculation results allowed us to determine resonator <b>eigenfrequency</b> and identify dependences of the <b>eigenfrequency</b> on the geometric features of the resonator and of the duct in which it is located. The work considers the concentric Helmholtz resonators in ducts of circular and square cross-sections, when the neck of the resonator is a hole in the wall of the duct. Then for a duct of square cross-section two Helmholtz resonator models with its different location are considered. In the first model the resonator is located on the sidewall of the duct, and the second resonator is concentric. For a concentric resonator also the relationship between the attached length of the neck resonator and the chamber diameter was studied. Carried out researches have allowed us to establish that the shape of the resonator camera has a smaller effect on the <b>eigenfrequency</b> of the resonator than the geometry of its neck. The main parameter that defines the <b>eigenfrequency</b> of Helmholtz resonators with the same geometrical parameters is the attached length of the neck resonator. In turn, the attached length of the neck resonator is determined, mainly, by the ratio of neck diameter to the diameter of the duct. The obtained results allow us to improve the accuracy of estimating the <b>eigenfrequency</b> of Helmholtz resonators thereby giving an opportunity to improve the quality of their acoustic design. </p...|$|R
