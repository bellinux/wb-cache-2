When the flag is washed, it must be dried indoors. A {{worn-out}} flag must be disposed of by burning (though not {{with the intent to}} disgrace it), or alternatively by cutting it to pieces small enough not to be recognizable as parts of the flag. The flag must not be buried in the ground or the sea (including not throwing it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>garbage).</b>|$|E

500|$|It {{was also}} {{performed}} on Gaga's The Monster Ball Tour. The piano version was played by Gaga while balancing {{on the piano}} stool and holding one leg up in the air. Rapper Kid Cudi joined her then to perform his song [...] "Make Her Say" [...] which contains a sample of [...] "Poker Face". The actual version was performed at the last segment of the show. Gaga wore a dress made of guns and during the performance she pumped {{her hands in the}} air. For the revamped Monster Ball shows in 2010-11, Gaga was dancing around the stage while whipping a chain. It was also performed at the 52nd Grammy Awards, where she opened the show with the song while standing on a pedestal. Midway through the performance, she was flung <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>garbage</b> chute of the Fame Factory set, before emerging seated at a piano, facing Elton John. In May 2011, Gaga performed the song during Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria. The song was included on the set list of her 2012-3 Born This Way Ball Tour in which she sports a modified version of her infamous meat dress. Gaga and her dancers put themselves headfirst into enormous meat grinders during the performance. For her 2014 residency show, Lady Gaga Live at Roseland Ballroom she chose to perform the song in a piano-only rendition. In the same year, at the [...] tour, Gaga performed the song in a medley with [...] "Just Dance" [...] and [...] "Telephone" [...] while wearing knee-length white dress and heels, and a bob wig.|$|E

500|$|In the summer, the 45th did its {{training}} at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, after which Middleton was in command for winter {{training at}} Pine Camp, New York. Here the temperature dipped to 36 {{degrees below zero}} (F) and snow drifted head-high. A soldier in the division {{by the name of}} Bill Mauldin did a cartoon showing slop from the kitchen frozen in a column as it descended <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>garbage</b> can outside. Mauldin later became famous for his cartoons during World War II, and won two Pulitzer Prizes for his work. [...] In February 1943 the training moved from Pine Camp to Camp Pickett, Virginia for mountain training, and then to the Atlantic Coast for ship-to-shore training between Norfolk, Virginia and Solomons, Maryland. In early April, while the division was at Camp Pickett, Middleton was sent to North Africa with some of his staff to begin planning the ensuing military operation. Here he went to the headquarters of the Seventh Army commander, Lieutenant General George S. Patton, in Morocco and stayed nearly a month. Patton would command the Seventh Army in the Sicily landings during the summer, and the 45th would be the only combat-loaded division coming from the United States. With the division scheduled to sail from Norfolk on 5 June, Middleton left beforehand to complete the planning for the landing on a hostile shore, this time reporting to the II Corps headquarters of Lieutenant General Omar Bradley in Algiers, Algeria. For this operation, Bradley was subordinate to Patton, under British overall direction. By the time the division arrived in Oran, Algeria, the planning was complete, and the unit was able to run one rehearsal in western Algeria before embarking for Sicily.|$|E

Additionally, despite her claim of having been held captive outdoors for days, Brawley was not suffering from hypothermia, was well-nourished, and appeared to have brushed her teeth recently. Despite her clothing being charred, there were no burns on her body. Although a shoe she was wearing was cut through, Brawley had no injuries to her foot. The racial epithets written on her were upside down, which led to suspicion that Brawley had written the words. Testimony from her schoolmates indicated she had attended a local party {{during the time of}} her supposed abduction.
