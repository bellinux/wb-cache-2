40|$|Reducing power {{consumption}} {{is an important}} issue for integrated circuits in portable devices relying on batteries and systems without external power supply. Scaling of the supply voltage VDD in integrated circuits is a powerful tool for reducing the {{power consumption}}, due to the quadratic dependence on VDD. MOSFETs, however, exhibit a fundamental limitation for the drain current increase per applied gate voltage difference. The tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) provides the ability for beating this limitation, thus offering a performance advantage over MOSFETs for ultra-low VDD. In this work, TFETs are fabricated with respect to design rules deduced from basic physical relations for the tunneling probability. The aim is to increase the tunneling probability in order to obtain higher drive currents in the devices. A tri-gated nanowire design in combination with a high-k/metal gate stacks is employed in order to increase the electrostatic gate control. Devices are fabricated on tensile-strained Si on insulator (SSOI) as well as compressively strained SiGe on SOI substrates. Fabricated devices reveal enhanced current for smaller band gap and effective carrier mass in those materials. In order to further increase ION$ and prevent IOFF degradation occurring in small band gap TFET <b>homostructures,</b> a NW based heterostructure design with enlarged tunnel junction area is conceived and fabricated. Device characterization of this structure reveals superior performance and large ION/IOFF ratio. TCAD simulations demonstrate how the structure could be adapted to utilize line tunneling in an inverted source region for further current improvement. SSOI NW TFET characteristics are investigated and compared to MOSFETs fabricated with analog processing. Temperature dependence of TFET characteristics is analyzed and hot carrier effects in the tunnel junction are revealed by charge pumping measurements. Furthermore, the feasibility of TFETs for logic application is studied by fabrication of inverter structures. A comparison of TFET and MOSFET inverters reveals degradation of the voltage transfer characteristics caused by the ambipolarity of TFETs. An emulated TFET structure based on the fabricated SiGe/Si heterostructure with reduced ambipolarity proves to prevent output degradation of the TFET inverter and demonstrates sufficiently high noise margins down to ultra-low supply voltages.

40|$|The {{tunneling}} {{field-effect transistor}} (TFET) {{is one of}} the most promising candidates for future low-power electronics because of its potential to achieve a subthreshold swing less than the 60 mV/decade thermal limit at room temperature. It can surpass this limit because the turn-on of tunneling does not sample the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of carriers that gives rise to the 60 mV/decade limit in conventional devices. However, theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of TFET device characteristics have differed by a wide margin-experimental subthreshold characteristics have not achieved the switching steepness (i. e., the change in drain current with applied gate voltage) of theoretical simulations. Non-ideal effects, such as non-abrupt band edges, phonon-assisted tunneling, and trap states, are discussed as mechanisms that may degrade theoretical predications. A strained-Si/strained-Ge bilayer TFET is used as a test-bed device to better understand the discrepancy between simulation and experiment. The bilayer TFET studied in this work eliminates channel doping and uses the strained-Si/strained-Ge heterostructure. Band-to-band tunneling occurs perpendicular to the gate, in-line with the gate electric field. Multiple gates are used so that the impact of the directionality of tunneling on switching abruptness can be studied. The band alignment of the strained-Si/strained-Ge heterostructure is extracted from a MOS-capacitor structure though an experimental quasistatic CV technique. The extracted effective band gap (related to the tunneling barrier) is shown to be only - 200 meV for the heterostructure, and the valence band offset is shown to be - 100 meV larger than predicted by density-functional theory. New deformation potentials are suggested for the Si-Ge material system based on the experimentally extracted band alignments. The impact of quantization on the turn-on voltage and gate-leakage current in a thin-body bilayer TFET structure is studied, and large confinement energy is shown to be especially problematic at body thicknesses less than 10 nm. An InAs structure with a body thickness less than 7 nm is shown to require a larger turn-on voltage than either Si or Ge <b>homostructures</b> due to the very light electron mass in InAs that leads to a large confinement energy. The strained- Si/strained-Ge heterostructure is shown to dramatically reduce the turn-on voltage due to its small effective band gap. Quantization is shown to limit the gate efficiency since increasing the body voltage, in order to align the electron and hole eigenstates in energy, increases the electric field across the structure, which in turn increases quantization. Gate leakage current increases exponentially as the body thickness decreases because the body voltage (and hence, the electric field) at turn-on increases with decreasing body thickness and gate leakage is exponentially dependent on the electric field. Non-ideal two-dimensional effects are investigated as mechanisms that degrade the switching characteristics of perpendicular TFETs (i. e. devices with tunneling perpendicular to the gate). Abrupt termination of a heavily doped semiconductor layer, often present in perpendicular TFET structures, can lead to large in-plane electric fields that give rise to parasitic diagonal tunneling paths, as opposed to the desired perpendicular tunneling paths. While the turn-on of each leakage path may be individually sharp, the sum of all tunneling paths is smeared by the multiple turn-ons and results in a degraded transfer characteristic for the device. The characteristic length, used for determining the length scale of potential fluctuations in short-channel MOSFETs, is suggested as a parameter that can be used to evaluate the likelihood of parasitic tunneling paths in a perpendicular TFET structure. The fabrication of the 3 Gate strained-Si/strained-Ge bilayer TFET is detailed. The process includes epitaxial growth of a highly strained heterostructure, planarization of a bottom gate, wafer bonding of an epitaxial wafer to a handle wafer, etch-back of the epitaxial wafer leaving the thin strained-Si/strained-Ge heterostructure, and standard processing to create devices. Future work on electrical characterization of the experimental 3 Gate bilayer TFET is discussed. Several test configurations are suggested as a way to probe the effects of diagonal tunneling on the abruptness of the switching characteristics. by James Towfik Teherani. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the electronic and structural properties of interfaces and quantum wells constructed from GaN, AIN, InN and their alloys. Calculations have been carried out on the electronic properties of the nitrides in the wurtzite crystal structure using the complex bandstructure method. Although this method has previously been applied to semiconductors with the zincblende crystal structure, the author believes {{that this is the first}} time the complex bandstructure method has been applied to systems with a wurtzite crystal structure. The complex bandstructures are derived from bulk bandstructures which have been calculated within the framework of the plane wave empirical pseudopotential method. The bound states of nitride quantum well heterostructures are calculated by the matching of complex bandstructure wavefunctions at the heterointerfaces. The effects of biaxial strain in the structures are taken into account by a suitable parameterisation of the pseudopotential form factors and the effects of alloying are described by the virtual crystal approximation. The method of matching the complex bandstructure wavefunctions at heterointerfaces has also been extended to wurtzite-zincblende homointerfaces and applied to a wurtzite-zincblende <b>homostructure</b> quantum well. The wurtzite-zincblende homointerface is further examined using first principles calculations based on density functional theory. As a result of this work a complex bandstructure method for calculating the electronic properties of wurtzite-wurtzite and wurtzite-zincblende structures has been established as a calculational tool. Further, the efficacy of the method has been demonstrated by calculation of the bound state energies and carrier probability densities of GaN-InGaN-GaN and AlGaN-GaN-AlGaN quantum wells and the inter-subband absorption spectrum of an AlGaN-GaN- AlGaN conduction band well.

I grew gold-catalyzed GaAs nanowires via the vapour-liquid-solid mechanism using the metalorganic chemical vapor deposition technique. A thin GaP shell was used to passivate the sidewall surface states in GaAs nanowires. Electrical and optical measurements were carried out on the core/shell GaAs/GaP nanowires to demonstrate unpinning of the Fermi level by improvement in the nanowire resistivity and photoluminescence, respectively. Control of the surface recombination velocity in GaAs nanowires was also achieved using a thin lattice-matched InGaP passivating shell. This was determined through an enhancement of the minority carrier diffusion lengths in GaAs/InGaP nanowires measured using electron beam induced current technique.
