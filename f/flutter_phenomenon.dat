40|$|Long-span cable {{supported}} bridges {{are prone}} to aerodynamic instabilities caused by wind and this phenomenon is usually a major design criterion. If the wind speed exceeds the critical flutter speed of the bridge, this constitutes an Ultimate Limit State. The prediction of the flutter boundary therefore requires accurate and robust models. This paper aims at studying various combinations of models to predict the <b>flutter</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> Since flutter is a coupling of aerodynamic forcing with a structural dynamics problem, different types and classes of models can be combined to study the interaction. Here, both numerical approaches and analytical models are utilised and coupled in different ways to assess the prediction quality of the hybrid model. Models for aerodynamic forces employed are the analytical Theodorsen expressions for the motion-enduced aerodynamic forces of a flat plate and Scanlan derivatives as a Meta model. Further, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations using the Vortex Particle Method (VPM) were used to cover numerical models. The structural representations were dimensionally reduced to two degree of freedom section models calibrated from global models {{as well as a}} fully three-dimensional Finite Element (FE) model. A two degree of freedom system was analysed analytically as well as numerically. Generally, all models were able to predict the <b>flutter</b> <b>phenomenon</b> and relatively close agreement was found for the particular bridge.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the {{development}} and applications of least squares kinetic upwind method for moving nodes (LSKUM-MN). The LSKUM-MN is a meshfree solver capable of handling unsteady flow past multiple moving boundaries. The method originates from Least Squares Kinetic Upwind Method (LSKUM) which is a meshfree method. LSKUM formulation is modified to include the effect of moving nodes thereby leading to LSKUM-MN. Two step defect correction is generally used in LSKUM to achieve spatial higher order accuracy. In this work we have used MCIR splitting to achieve spatial accuracy. This avoids computing the moving fluxes for tertiary nodes if two step defect correction were used. Dual time stepping is used to achieve temporal accuracy. Eigen direction based weights are used to compute spatial derivatives which improves robustness of the code. This method {{has been applied to}} a variety of problems involving moving boundaries and unsteady flows. In this paper we present the application of the method to flow past multiple moving airfoils, flutter prediction in turbomachines and to time domain aeroelastic analysis.

40|$|Bridge <b>flutter</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{presents}} an important criterion of instability, {{which should be}} considered in the bridge design phase. This paper presents different bridge flutter methods which can be used to solve the flutter problem. Most commonly used frequency-domain approach is based on the formulation of aero elastic forces with frequency dependent coefficients called flutter derivatives. The critical wind speed, as the main critical condition for the onset of flutter is obtained based on these aero elastic forces. Aero elastic forces can be also expressed in the time-domain, using so-called indicial functions. These functions are usually determined from the corresponding flutter derivatives. In situations when fluid-memory effects tend to become small the quasi-steady theory can be used as an approximation of aero elastic forces.

40|$|Panel flutter is an {{aeroelastic}} phenomenon {{that can cause}} failure of panels of wings, fuselages and missiles. It happens mostly at supersonic regime even though it {{can be observed in}} subsonic ranges. The panel <b>flutter</b> <b>phenomena</b> may appear in space structures during the coasting phase. Some nondestructive aeroelastic phenomena were detected on Saturn V rockets, and analytical and experimental test was carried out as shown by Nichols [1]. During the design of aerospace structures, {{especially in the case of}} thin­walled structure, the aeroelastic response have to be considered in order to avoid catastrophic events. In order to avoid the panel <b>flutter</b> <b>phenomena</b> an accurate design of the dynamic response of a structure is required. The possibility to modify the natural frequencies of a structure may move the <b>flutter</b> <b>phenomena</b> out from the critical mission regimes. In this sense, the use of innovative materials could lead to an improvements of the aeroelastic behaviour of a structure. In this work, the effects on the aeroelastic instabilities of the use of viscoelastic materials in multilayered panels have been investigated. The mechanical properties of the viscoelastic materials depend on the frequencies in which they are vibrating, the dynamic response of a panel could be, therefore, modified with the use of such materials. On the other and the analysis of these materials requires an iterative solution that makes the solution time consuming, the use of efficient numerical models is therefore mandatory. The aeroelastic analysis of elastic and viscoelastic multi­layered panels is performed by using a refined one­dimensional theory based on the Carrera Unified Formulation,CUF [3]. Equivalent Single Layer (ESL) and Layer Wise (LW) models are considered. The use of these structural models provide an accurate solution with a lower computational cost with respect to classical models. The aerodynamic model is based on the linear piston theory [2] therefore only supersonic regimes are considered. The results show that the use of refined structural models is able to provide accurate results in the description of the aeroelastic response of a multi­layered panel. The use of an advanced kinematics approximation, provided by the refined 1 D models, through the panel thickness leads to accurate results also when complex multi­layered panels are considered. The introduction of viscoelastic materials is able to modify the response of the panel and can be used to modify the range in which the aeroelastic instabilities appear.

50|$|Fluttering is a {{physical}} phenomenon in which several degrees of freedom of a structure become coupled in an unstable oscillation driven by the wind. This movement inserts energy to the bridge during each cycle so that it overcomes the natural damping of the structure; the composed system (bridge-fluid) therefore behaves {{as if it had}} an effective negative damping (or had positive feedback), leading to an exponentially growing response. In other words, the oscillations increase in amplitude with each cycle because the wind pumps in more energy than the flexing of the structure can dissipate, and finally drives the bridge toward failure due to excessive deflection and stress. The wind speed that causes the beginning of the <b>fluttering</b> <b>phenomenon</b> (when the effective damping becomes zero) is known as the flutter velocity. Fluttering occurs even in low-velocity winds with steady flow. Hence, bridge design must ensure that flutter velocity will be higher than the maximum mean wind speed present at the site.|$|R
