50|$|LVDS {{works in}} both {{parallel}} and serial data transmission. In parallel transmissions multiple data differential pairs carry several signals at once including a clock signal to synchronize the data. In serial communications, multiple single-ended signals are serialized {{into a single}} differential pair with a data rate {{equal to that of}} all the combined single-ended channels. For example, a 7-bit wide parallel bus serialized into a single pair that will operate at 7 times the data rate of one single-ended channel. The devices for converting between serial and parallel data are the serializer and <b>deserializer,</b> abbreviated to SerDes when the two devices are contained in one integrated circuit.As an example, FPD-Link actually uses LVDS in a combination of serialized and parallel communications. The original FPD-Link designed for 18-bit RGB video has 3 parallel data pairs and a clock pair, so this is a parallel communication scheme. However, each of the 3 pairs transfers 7 serialized bits during each clock cycle. So the FPD-Link parallel pairs are carrying serialized data, but use a parallel clock to recover and synchronize the data.|$|E

A novel and RMI-specific version of static heap analysis is used to derive information about objects that are passed as arguments of remote method invocations. This knowledge of objects and their interrelations is used for three optimizations. First, dynamic introspection and/or (recursive) dynamic invocations of object specific serializers is slow. With knowledge from our heap analysis, the marshaling of graphs of argument objects can be inlined at the call site. Hence, many method table lookups and skeleton indirections of previous approaches can be avoided and less protocol information is sent over the network. Secondly, because object graphs may be passed as RMI arguments, cyclic references need to be detected. With our heap analysis, we can detect {{if there is no}} potential for cycles and hence, cycle detection code can be left out of the serialization and marshaling codes. Finally, object arguments to remote methods cause object creation and garbage collection.

40|$|Bidirectional transformations between {{different}} data representations occur frequently in modern software systems. They appear as serializers and <b>deserializers,</b> as database views and view updaters, and more. Manually building bidirectional transformations [...] -by writing two separate functions that {{are intended to}} be inverses [...] -is tedious and error prone. A better approach {{is to use a}} domain-specific language in which both directions can be written as a single expression. However, these domain-specific languages can be difficult to program in, requiring programmers to manage fiddly details while working in a complex type system. To solve this, we present Optician, a tool for type-directed synthesis of bijective string transformers. The inputs to Optician are two ordinary regular expressions representing two data formats and a few concrete examples for disambiguation. The output is a well-typed program in Boomerang (a bidirectional language based on the theory of lenses). The main technical challenge involves navigating the vast program search space efficiently enough. Unlike most prior work on type-directed synthesis, our system operates {{in the context of a}} language with a rich equivalence relation on types (the theory of regular expressions). We synthesize terms of a equivalent language and convert those generated terms into our lens language. We prove the correctness of our synthesis algorithm. We also demonstrate empirically that our new language changes the synthesis problem from one that admits intractable solutions to one that admits highly efficient solutions. We evaluate Optician on a benchmark suite of 39 examples including both microbenchmarks and realistic examples derived from other data management systems including Flash Fill, a tool for synthesizing string transformations in spreadsheets, and Augeas, a tool for bidirectional processing of Linux system configuration files.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a serializer/deserializer scheme for asynchronous address event representation (AER) bit-serial interchip communications.

Two extra preamble bits are used for alignment. Transmission clock {{is embedded in the}} data using Manchester encoding. As opposed to conventional LVDS links, the presented approach allows to stop physical communication between data events, so that no “comma” characters need to be transmitted during these pauses. As soon as a new event needs to be transmitted, the link recovers immediately thanks to a built-in control voltage memorization circuit. As a result, power consumption of the serializer and <b>deserializer</b> circuits is proportional to data event rate.
