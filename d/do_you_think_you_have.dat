You will find it in your own room, my dear Lady, in front of your own mirror.

A little less care of your pots and your pans, Madam, a little more of yourself were wiser. Polish yourself up, Madam; you had a pretty wit once, a pleasant laugh, a conversation that was not confined exclusively to the short-comings of servants, the wrong-doings of tradesmen. My dear Madam, we do not live on spotless linen, and crumbless carpets. Hunt out that bundle of old letters you keep tied up in faded ribbon at the back of your bureau drawer--a pity you don't read them oftener. He did not enthuse about your cuffs and collars, gush over the neatness of your darning. It was your tangled hair he raved about, your sunny smile (we have not seen it for some years, Madam--the fault of the Cook and the Butcher, I presume), your little hands, your rosebud mouth--it has lost its shape, Madam, of late. Try a little less scolding of Mary Ann, and practise a laugh once a day: you might get back the dainty curves. It would be worth trying. It was a pretty mouth once.|$|E
5000|$|While Kovalev {{entered the}} 1980 {{season as a}} top {{contender}} for the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics title, he was clearly poorly trained, overweight and uninspired. As a result, his jumps had become too inconsistent. For example, weeks prior to the Olympics, Kovalev had placed 3rd at the 1980 European Championships with poor short and free programs, far behind his chief rivals, Robin Cousins and Jan Hoffmann. Once in Lake Placid, skating officials and news reporters took note {{of the fact that}} Kovalev, perhaps unmotivated and skeptical of his chances, missed most of the practice sessions. When he did show up, he was even unable to complete basic jumps. After observing his practices, an American reporter asked Kovalev at the pre-competition press conference, [...] "Aside from {{the fact that you are}} the best-looking male skater in the competition, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> what it takes to win here?", Kovalev burst out of the conference, never to be seen in public again as a competitor. The Soviet officials soon withdrew him from the competition after placing 5th in compulsory figures. Kovalev retired from competitive skating, and began his career as a skating coach.|$|E
5000|$|... "He {{told us that}} he {{had heard}} the {{following}} story being told by Athenogenus Athenogenes, the bishop of Petra, the son of amma Damiana:My aunt (avia mea) Joanna had a brother called Adelphius, bishop of Arabessus." [...] Avia in Latin literally means grandmother, the mother of someone’s parent, not aunt. She herself was abbess of a monastery of women. This bishop went out one day to visit his sister in her monastery. As he went in to the courtyard (atrium) of the monastery he saw a sister possessed of a demon lying on the pavement. The bishop called out to his sister: [...] "Doesn't it worry you that this sister is being troubled and besmirched like this? You surely must know that as abbess you have authority over all your sisters?" [...] "What can I do against a demon?" [...] she replied [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been doing all these years?" [...] replied the bishop, who then made a prayer and cleansed that sister of the demon. Since this Joanna was the grandmother of Athenogenes, du Cange identified her as the likely wife of Paul, mother of Damiana, Maurice and their siblings. There is some doubt on how old Joanna and Adelphius were supposed to be. Another tale by Moschus reports them having met John Chrysostom (c. 347 - 407) in person, during a brief stay of his in Cucusus (modern Göksun).|$|E

5000|$|Starting in September, Zawacki had a three month long Artist-in-residence in Detroit, Michigan in {{preparation}} for his solo exhibition titled 'Remix'. Due to Tavar's engagement with street work and busy travel schedule, Tavar had not made a solo exhibition since 2012 in Melbourne, Australia. Zawacki's Remix exhibition displayed {{a variety of different}} laser cut wood panels that were then re-arranged and exchanged into the final piece. Remix had an emphasis on curved cut patterns and the exchanging of identical wood cuts.In an interview Tavar said [...] "The intention for my most recent body of artwork is to explore new directions and re-invent the arrow icon I have been creating for over the past 15 years. The arrow icon is sharp and constructed of straight lines and angles, void of any curved elements. My intention is to contrast the existing sharp angles of the arrow, with the curved and circular cut lines, achieving a dynamic balance between the two with a new fresh look. Similar to that of a hair stylist making a Perm (hairstyle) on a head of hair that has always been straight." [...] Tavar described his process and choice of using wood as his medium for Remix [...] "My process was to take the straight structure of the arrow and remix it with curvaceous wood cuts, contrasting color combination, all whilst maintaining the uniformed integrity of a line. had an emphasis on inter changing similar pieces of cut wood in an organized, curved Composition (visual arts), I had pre-designed. I chose wood as my medium as it’s a tangible and perfect for this style I wanted to achieve. During an interview Tavar was asked the question 'What strides <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made with this work?' Tavar said [...] "I feel doing this show It’s allowed me to break out into being more abstract, and colorful. I’ve been gravitated towards moving into dissecting the arrow icon. Breaking it into pieces, and then smaller pieces and becoming more abstract. This process has allowed me to experiment and learn from mistakes I’ve made with what works good, and what works even better." ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if an athlete’s self-report of a history of concussion would increase if they are provided with information about concussions. ^ Study Design: This study used a group design pre-test information group and a post-test information group matched for age. Methods: Prior to cognitive testing, the athletes were divided into an experimental and control group. The experimental group received information about concussions before taking the cognitive test. The control group did not receive concussion information before cognitive testing. Both groups completed a questionnaire following testing that asked: “Based on your experience here today, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> ever had a concussion?” ^ Results: A Chi square analysis found that the proportion of those who self-reported a history of concussion was not significantly different between those who received information and those who did not receive information prior to testing (p= 0. 183). An additional chi square analysis found that age of the athletes was not a factor (p= 0. 199). ^ Conclusions: This study concluded that information provided to an athlete about a concussion is not a significant factor in whether or not that individual self-reported a concussion. The study also found no statistically significant changes between age groups. Therefore, this study suggests there may be other factors that play a greater role in predicting self-reporting of concussions. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of sport-related concussion is debatable. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report an extrapolated {{incidence of}} 1. 6 to 3. 2 million recreational/sports-related traumatic brain injuries a year, the suspicion {{is that the}} incidence is much higher (CDC, 2014). An important consideration in determining the incidence involves whether an athlete’s knowledge of what a concussion is influences their self-report of prior concussions. ^ Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} is to replicate and extend Pfirman (2015) in determining whether providing information about concussion will increase the self-report of a history of concussion. Furthermore, this study investigates whether there is a difference in self-reporting between males and females and between age groups (18 and over; 17 and under). ^ Study Design: Group design comparing a Pre-Test Information Group and a Post-Test Information Group matched for gender and age. ^ Methods: Before taking the ImPACT test the athletes (participants) will be randomly separated into two groups, the Pre-Test Information Group and the Post-Test Information group. The Pre-Test Information Group will be read a script describing symptoms associated with a concussion prior to taking the ImPACT test, while the Post-Test Information Group will not receive concussion information until after the ImPACT test. Both groups will complete a questionnaire following ImPACT testing that asks: “Based on your experience here today, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> ever had a concussion? What is your age? What grade are you in school? Are you male or female?” ^ Results: A Chi Square analysis yielded that there was no statistically significant difference between the Pre-Test Information Group and the Post-Test Information Group (p= 0. 160). An additional Chi Square analysis found that age of the athletes was not a factor (p= 0. 160), and there was no difference in gender (p= 0. 160). ...|$|E
