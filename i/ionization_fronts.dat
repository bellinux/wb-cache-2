5000|$|The H II {{region of}} NGC 2467 {{has been the}} target of various {{investigations}} to elucidate the process of star formation. Unresolved questions include understanding {{the degree to which the}} stars already formed in such regions, especially the massive O or B stars, can affect the future formation of stars in the region: Do these pre-existing stars trigger the formation of others? One such investigation was conducted using the Spitzer Space Telescope, which discovered 45 young stellar objects (YSOs), or protostars, in the region during its [...] "cold" [...] mission, i.e. before its supply of liquid helium ran out. The YSO's are mostly along the edge of the HII region. The concentrated distribution of these objects spatially correlated with the <b>ionization</b> <b>fronts</b> provides evidence for triggered star formation. The newly forming ptotostars are concentrated in areas where the shock front driven in advance of the ionization front compresses the molecular gas.|$|E
5000|$|An HI {{region or}} H I region (read H one) is a {{cloud in the}} {{interstellar}} medium composed of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI), {{in addition to the}} local abundance of helium and other elements. (H is the chemical symbol for hydrogen, and [...] "II" [...] is the Roman numeral. It is customary in astronomy to use the Roman numeral I for neutral atoms, II for singly-ionised—HII is H+ in other sciences—III for doubly-ionised, e.g. OIII is O++, etc.) These regions do not emit detectable visible light (except in spectral lines from elements other than hydrogen) but are observed by the 21-cm (1,420 MHz) region spectral line. This line has a very low transition probability, so requires large amounts of hydrogen gas for it to be seen. At <b>ionization</b> <b>fronts,</b> where HI regions collide with expanding ionized gas (such as an H II region), the latter glows brighter than it otherwise would. The degree of ionization in an HI region is very small at around 10−4 (i.e. one particle in 10,000). At typical interstellar pressures in galaxies like the Milky Way, HI regions are most stable at temperatures of either below 100 K or above several thousand K; gas between these temperatures heats or cools very quickly to reach one of the stable temperature regimes. Within one of these phases, the gas is usually considered isothermal, except near an expanding H II region. Near an expanding H II region is a dense HI region, separated from the undisturbed HI region by a shock front and from the H II region by an ionization front.|$|E

Its dynamics is approximated by those of radiative fluctuations appearing at a similar position and studied {{by means of a}} time-delay-estimation technique in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak. Compared to theory the dynamics can be described as follows: at increasing density the <b>ionization</b> <b>front</b> moves upstream to reduce ionization radiation in order to balance the increased recombination radiation. The recombination zone stays close to the target strike point. The parallel motion of the <b>ionization</b> <b>front</b> is determined by the perpendicular neutral motion. The divertor nose constitutes an obstacle for the perpendicular neutral flux from the target to the region above the X-point. Passing into this shadow the neutral flux above the X-point is strongly reduced, the <b>ionization</b> <b>front</b> fades away and the heat flux from upstream can increase the temperature in the recombination region, subsequently reducing recombination and reforming an <b>ionization</b> <b>front</b> below the X-point.

For instance, there exists a unicity relation between both the H surface brightness or the <b>ionization</b> <b>front</b> [S II] density, and the scale L of the power law, where L is the distance between the <b>ionization</b> <b>front</b> and the onset of the density near the exciting star.

The first {{sources of}} {{ionizing}} radiation to condense {{out of the}} dark and neutral IGM sent <b>ionization</b> <b>fronts</b> sweeping outward through their surroundings, overtaking other condensed objects and photoevaporating them.

They include CH 3 OH, H 2 CO, and H 2 S.

40|$|Abstract- When {{pulse of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation impinges upon a moving plasmalneutral gas boundary, i. e., an ioniza-tion front, its frequency and duration are altered. The largest frequency upshifts and pulse compressions are obtained when radiation is incident on an <b>ionization</b> <b>front</b> moving {{at close to}} the speed of light. Such an <b>ionization</b> <b>front</b> is created when a short laser pulse photo-ionizes a gas through which it propa-gates. We have done theoretical and experimental work on the interaction of radiation with a relativistically propagating, un-derdense <b>ionization</b> <b>front</b> in a waveguide. In the experiment, 35 GHz microwave pulses were upshifted and compressed upon encountering a moving front. The frequency spectrum of the upshifted radiation was determined independently using sections of cutoff waveguides and a microwave diffraction grating.

40|$|Multi-atmospheric pressure, pulsed {{electric}} discharge excited lasers require pre-ionization to produce spatially uniform glows. Many such systems use corona bars to produce ultraviolet (UV) and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light as photo-ionization sources for this purpose. Corona bars are transient surface discharges, typically in a cylindrical geometry, that sustain high electron temperatures {{and so are}} efficient UV and VUV sources. In this paper, results from a numerical study of surface corona-bar discharges in a multi-atmosphere pressure Ne/Xe gas mixture are discussed. The discharge consists of a high-voltage electrode placed {{on the surface of}} a corona bar which is a dielectric tube surrounding a cylindrical metal electrode. After the initial breakdown an <b>ionization</b> <b>front</b> propagates along the circumference of the corona bar and produces a thin plasma sheet near the dielectric surface.

The intensity of the 3. 3 micron feature reaches a maximum between the <b>ionization</b> <b>front</b> and the H 2 peak.
