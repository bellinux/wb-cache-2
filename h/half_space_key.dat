40|$|Abstract. We {{investigated}} {{binocular rivalry}} {{in the two}} cerebral hemispheres of callosotomized (split-brain) observers. We found that rivalry occurs for complex stimuli in split-brain observers, {{and that it is}} similar in the two hemispheres. This poses difficulties for two theories of rivalry: (1) that rivalry occurs because of switching of activity between the two hemispheres, and (2) that rivalry is controlled by a structure in the right frontoparietal cortex. Instead, similar rivalry from the two hemispheres is consistent with a theory that its mechanism is low in the visual system, at which each hemisphere conducts a similar analysis of its <b>half</b> of visual <b>space.</b> <b>Key</b> words: binocular rivalry, corpus callosum, split brain 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{geographically}} distributed {{web server}} (GDWS) system consists of multiple server nodes interconnected by a {{metropolitan area network}} (MAN) or a wide area network (WAN). It can achieve better eciency in handling ever-increasing web requests than centralized web servers because its throughput will not be limited by available bandwidth connecting to a central server. The key research issue {{in the design of}} GDWS is how to replicate and distribute the documents of a website among the server nodes. This paper proposes a density-based replication scheme and applies it to our proposed Extensible GDWS architecture. We adopted a partial duplication scheme where document replication targets only at hot objects in a website. To distribute the replicas generated via the density-based replication scheme, we propose four dierent document distribution algorithms: Greedy-cost, Maximal-density, Greedy-penalty, and Proximity-aware. A proximity-based routing mechanism is designed to incorporate these algorithms for achieving better web server performance in a WAN environment. Simulation results show that the Greedy-penalty algorithm yields most stable load balancing performance, and the Greedy-cost algorithm causes least internal trac. Our scheme can achieve 80 %of the performance of full-replication, with <b>half</b> the disk <b>space.</b> <b>Key</b> words: Document replication and distribution, Distributed web server...|$|R
