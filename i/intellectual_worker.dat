60|$|There is in {{this passage}} one {{particularly}} valuable idea, {{the idea of an}} association of people to guarantee the welfare of their children in common. I will follow that a little, though it takes me away from my main line of thought. It seems to me that such an association might be found in many cases a practicable way of easing the conflict that so many men and women experience, between their individual public service and their duty to their own families. Many people of exceptional gifts, whose gifts are not necessarily remunerative, are forced by these personal considerations to direct them more or less askew, to divert them from their best application to some inferior but money-making use; and many more are given the disagreeable alternative of evading parentage or losing the freedom of mind needed for socially beneficial work. This is particularly the case with many scientific investigators, many sociological and philosophical workers, many artists, teachers and the like. Even when such people are fairly prosperous personally they do not care to incur the obligation to keep prosperous at any cost to their work that a family in our competitive system involves. It gives great ease of mind to any sort of artistic or <b>intellectual</b> <b>worker</b> to feel free to become poor. I do not see why a group of such people should not attempt a merger of their family anxieties and family adventures, insure all its members, and while each retains a sufficient personal independence for freedom of word and movement, pool their family solicitudes and resources, organize a collective school and a common maintenance fund for all the children born of members of the association. I do not see why they should not in fact develop a permanent trust to maintain, educate and send out all their children into the world, a trust to which their childless friends and associates could contribute by gift and bequest, and to which the irregular good fortune that is not uncommon in the careers of these exceptional types could be devoted. I do not mean any sort of charity but an enlarged family basis.|$|E
60|$|If {{you seek}} to place {{yourself}} in sympathy with Comte {{it is best}} to think of him only as the <b>intellectual</b> <b>worker,</b> pursuing in uncomforted obscurity the laborious and absorbing task to which he had given up his whole life. His singularly conscientious fashion of elaborating his ideas made the mental strain more intense than even so exhausting a work as the abstract exposition of the principles of positive science need have been, if he had followed a more self-indulgent plan. He did not write down a word until he had first composed the whole matter in his mind. When he had thoroughly meditated every sentence, he sat down to write, and then, such was the grip of his memory, the exact order of his thoughts came back to him as if without an effort, and he wrote down precisely what he had intended to write, without the aid of a note or a memorandum, and without check or pause. For example, he began and completed in about six weeks a chapter in the Positive Philosophy (vol. v. ch. lv.), which would fill forty of the large pages of the Encyclopædia Britannica. Even if his subject had been merely narrative or descriptive, this would be a very satisfactory piece of continuous production. When we reflect that the chapter in question is not narrative, but an abstract exposition of the guiding principles of the movements of several centuries, with many threads of complex thought running along side by side all through the speculation, then the circumstances under which it was reduced to literary form are really astonishing. It is hardly possible for a critic to share the admiration expressed by some of Comte's disciples for his style. We are not so unreasonable as to blame him for failing to make his pages picturesque or thrilling; we do not want sunsets and stars and roses and ecstasy; but there is a certain standard for the most serious and abstract subjects. When compared with such philosophic writing as Hume's, Diderot's, Berkeley's, then Comte's manner is heavy, laboured, monotonous, without relief and without light. There is now and then an energetic phrase, but as a whole the vocabulary is jejune; the sentences are overloaded; the pitch is flat. A scrupulous insistence on making his meaning clear led to an iteration of certain adjectives and adverbs, which at length deaden the effect beyond the endurance of all but the most resolute students. Only the profound and stimulating interest of much of the matter prevents one from thinking of Rivarol's ill-natured remark upon Condorcet, that he wrote with opium on a page of lead. The general effect is impressive, not by any virtues of style, for we do not discern one, but by reason of the magnitude and importance of the undertaking, and the visible conscientiousness and the grasp with which it is executed. It is by sheer strength of thought, by the vigorous perspicacity with which he strikes the lines of cleavage of his subject, that he makes his way into the mind of the reader; in the presence of gifts of this power we need not quarrel with an ungainly style.|$|E

We would assume that reasons for late retirement are different in both groups of workers: In some countries (with stronger insurance and contribution elements in the pension system), intellectual workers’ typically later entry into full-time employment may contribute to later entitlements for pension. But during their career, <b>intellectual</b> <b>workers</b> often earn higher wages and feel less physical strain from work, which both may contribute to retirement needs occurring at older ages compared to other workers.|$|R

We find that timing of retirement is positively correlated between partners already at the stage of retirement planning. Moreover, characteristics of the pension system (statutory pension age, generosity of the system) influence the planned age of retirement. The strength of the effects regarding the pension system and the transition of work characteristics indeed differs between country groups.|$|R

40|$|Our {{hypothesis}} is that videogames are a paradigmatic media of Empire as described by Hardt and Negri–planetary, militarized hyper-capitalism–and {{of some of the}} forces presently challenging it. Why are virtual games the media of Empire, integral to and expressive of it like no other? They originated in the US military-industrial complex, the nuclear-armed core of capital’s global domination, to which power they remain umbilically connected. They were created by the hard-to-control hacker knowledge of a new type of <b>intellectual</b> <b>worker,</b> immaterial labour, vital to a fresh phase of capitalist expansion. In that phase, game machines have served as ubiquitous everyday incubators for the most advanced forces of production and communication, tutoring entire generations in digital technologies and networked communication. The game industry has pioneered methods of accumulation based on intellectual property rights, cognitive exploitation, cultural hybridization, transcontinentally subcontracted dirty work, and world-marketed commodities. Game making blurs the lines between work and play, production and consumption, voluntary activity and precarious exploitation, in a way that typifies the boundless exercise of biopower. At the same time, games themselves are an expensive consumer commodity which the global poor can only access illicitly, demonstrating the massive inequalities of this regime. Virtual games simulate identities as citizen-soldiers, free-agent workers, cyborg-adventurers, and corporate-criminals: virtual play trains flexible personalities for flexible jobs, shapes subjects for militarized markets, and makes becoming a neoliberal subject fun. And—taking us to the focus of this article—games exemplify Empire because they are also exemplary of the multitude, in that game culture includes subversive and alternative experiments searching for a way out. Just as the eighteenth-century novel was a textual apparatus generating the bourgeois personality required by mercantile colonialism (but also capable of criticizing it), and as twentieth-century cinema and television were integral to industrial consumerism (yet screened some of its darkest depictions), so virtual games are media constitutive of twenty-first century global hyper-capitalism and, perhaps, also of lines of exodus from it...|$|E
40|$|Between 1870 and 1899 in Italy 1051 writers {{published}} 2545 new {{novels in}} Italian. This research {{is focused on}} a database that collects data about those books and their authors. In this way we delineate a comprehensive overview of the Italian fiction literature {{of the late nineteenth}} century, bypassing the canonization of literary history. The aim of this research is to study how a specific kind of <b>intellectual</b> <b>worker</b> (the novelist) takes shape and how he fits into the deep changes that were taking place in Italian literary system of the time. The first part of this thesis focuses on the database: at first it emerges a sort of geography of the Italian novel, providing an accurate quantitative picture of the editorial production. We gathered different kinds of information about novels, in order to cover also aspects normally neglected as price, number of pages, number of reissues. Secondly, we focus on the figure of the novelist and its characteristics. Following data have been collected regarding each novelist: date of birth, country of birth, education, social background (through father's profession), any other work that is combined to the literary practice (teaching, journalism). Moreover, there is an attempt to account for the complete literary production of each author (other genres, the total number of novels). Database has been reworked through charts. In {{the second part of the}} research we analyzed the production of Italian novels through two different points of view: interactions with foreign novels and especially French novels (whose importation was very considerable) and the introduction of "Realism" (or "Verismo" or "Naturalism") in Italian literary system. Canonical studies of novel normally neglect both analysis of foreign fiction production (that was the common choice for an average Italian reader) and "non-artistic" topics within the artistic discourse (such as the contradiction between ethics of society and realist novel). The theoretical basis that inspired this work is the concept of "literary field" developed by Pierre Bourdieu, whose purpose is such a construction of an authentic sociology of artistic production. The model proposed by Bourdieu allows us to think the fields of cultural production as a relatively autonomous relational system, though it was designed on the French literary field of the late nineteenth century. In the same period, the conditions of fiction production in Italy were extremely different. Nevertheless Bourdieu's theory (and, in the same way, Franco Moretti's considerations on “distant reading”) allows to reclaim the study of art practices as an entirely legitimate research topic for a historian. ...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse some factors affecting preoperative plasma Mg concentration in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Material and Methods Adult patients scheduled for elective CABG with cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) under general anaesthesia were studied. Plasma Mg concentration was analysed before surgery in accordance with age, domicile, profession, tobacco smoking and preoperative Mg supplementation. Blood samples were obtained from the radial artery just before the administration of anaesthesia. Results 150 patients were studied. Mean preoperative plasma Mg concentration was 0. 93 ± 0. 17 mmol/L; mean concentration in patients – 1. 02 ± 0. 16; preoperative Mg supplementation was significantly higher than in patients without such supplementation. Moreover, <b>intellectual</b> <b>workers</b> supplemented Mg more frequently and had higher plasma Mg concentration than physical workers. Plasma Mg concentration decreases in elderly patients. Patients living in cities, on average, had the highest plasma Mg concentration. Smokers had significantly lower plasma Mg concentration than non-smokers. Conclusions 1.
