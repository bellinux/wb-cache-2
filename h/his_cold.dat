5|$|At the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, Gielgud {{did much}} to reclaim his {{position}} as a leading Shakespearean. <b>His</b> <b>cold,</b> unsympathetic Angelo in Peter Brook's production of Measure for Measure (1950) showed the public a new, naturalistic manner in his playing. He followed this with three other Shakespeare productions with Brook, which were well received. His own attempt at direction in Stratford, for Richardson's Macbeth in 1952, was much less successful, with poor notices for the star and worse ones for the director.|$|E
5|$|Cold Feet ran {{for five}} years from 1998 to 2003, and Nesbitt won the British Comedy Award for Best TV Comedy Actor in 2000, the Television and Radio Industries Club Award for Drama TV Performer of the Year in 2002, the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Performance in 2003, and the TV Quick Award for Best Actor in 2003. Nesbitt credits the role with raising his profile with the public. Further {{television}} roles during these five years included women's football team coach John Dolan {{in the first two}} series of Kay Mellor's Playing the Field (appearing alongside <b>his</b> <b>Cold</b> Feet co-star John Thomson), investigative journalists Ryan and David Laney in Resurrection Man (Marc Evans, 1998) and Touching Evil II respectively, and womaniser Stanley in Women Talking Dirty (Coky Giedroyc, 1999).|$|E
5|$|Following Sévérine's first {{appearances}} in promotional materials for Skyfall, film critics {{noted that the}} character was {{a return to the}} classic elements of the James Bond films, specifically Bond meeting a beautiful and mysterious woman. Critics had a mixed response to Sévérine, comparing her to previous Bond girls. The response to Bond's treatment of Sévérine was largely negative; commentators panned Bond's seduction of the character after discovering that she was a sex slave, and <b>his</b> <b>cold</b> response to her death. However, some critics defended Sévérine's story arc as appropriate for Bond's character development. The character has also been a topic of racial criticism, receiving comparisons to previous Bond girls Aki, Kissy Suzuki, and Wai Lin.|$|E

5|$|The Simpson family spent Christmas in England, {{before a}} trip to Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, where Simpson injured himself skiing, {{suffering}} a broken foot and a sprained ankle. He recovered, riding six-day races. At the Antwerp six-day, he dropped out {{on the fourth day}} with a cold. <b>His</b> <b>cold</b> worsened and he missed most of March. He abandoned Milan–San Remo {{at the foot of the}} Poggio. On 11 April, he finished seventh in Paris–Roubaix after crashing in the lead group. The crash forced him to miss the Tour of Flanders as he struggled to walk on his injured foot. In Liège–Bastogne–Liège he attacked with 's Felice Gimondi, catching an early break. They worked together for , until Gimondi gave up. Simpson rode alone before slipping on oil mixed with water; he stayed with the front group, finishing tenth.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, he {{made his}} third and final {{appearance}} as art dealer James Garrett in My Family. He also {{played the role of}} Mr Weston in the BBC costume drama Emma, which was broadcast in October 2009 on BBC One. He previously played Weston in a two-part adaptation of Emma for BBC Radio 4 in 2000. Between January and April 2010, Bathurst starred as Garry Essendine in a national touring revival of Noël Coward's Present Laughter. He had not seen Present Laughter before, though had seen several Coward plays in his 20s and did not imitate Coward's speech patterns while performing. Present Laughter was the first time Bathurst had appeared in a Coward play and he was cast in another, Blithe Spirit, later in the year. He plays Charles Condomine opposite Alison Steadman and <b>his</b> <b>Cold</b> Feet co-star Hermione Norris. The play toured theatres around southern England in 2010 and early 2011 before beginning a three-month run at the Apollo Theatre in London.|$|E
5|$|South Carolina Congressman Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), the Democratic Majority Whip, {{leaves his}} house in Washington, D.C. after hearing his neighbors’ dog {{get hit by a}} car. As he comforts the mortally-wounded dog, he looks into the camera and says “Moments like this require someone who will act, who will do the {{unpleasant}} thing, the necessary thing,” before calmly proceeding to strangle it. This introduces both his habit of breaking the fourth wall to narrate, and <b>his</b> <b>cold</b> and vicious nature. Frank and his wife, Claire (Robin Wright), go on to attend a New Year’s Eve party in honor of the new President-elect, Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), a fellow Democrat and winner of the 2012 election. Frank confesses to the viewer that he does not like Walker, but saw his political potential early on and ingratiated himself to him, putting himself in line to be nominated as Walker’s Secretary of State after 22 years in Congress.|$|E
6000|$|Herbert, however, {{answered}} nothing. He merely turned angrily to Ronald. 'I won't bandy words,' he said constrainedly in <b>his</b> <b>coldest</b> tone, 'with this infamous {{woman whom}} you have brought here on purpose to insult me; but I must request {{you to ask}} her to leave the house immediately. Your mother's home is no place to which to bring people of such a character.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'An {{excellent}} {{answer for}} them,' Herbert chimed in, in <b>his</b> <b>coldest</b> and calmest tone, 'but a very insufficient one for you.

And then, you know, dear,' he added, seeing a certain cloud gathering dimly on Selah's forehead, 'I want to make my wife a real lady.' ...|$|R
5|$|After {{reviving}} the Sacred Beasts, the hatred is purged, but the racial tensions remain. Veigue begins to have difficulty {{in dealing with}} Claire's condition, and <b>his</b> <b>cold</b> attitude causes her to leave with Milhaust. Eventually, Veigue opens up {{to the rest of}} the group and overcomes his difficulties. As the continuing negative feelings of Karegia's population are starting to damage the world, the group decide to revive Georgyas again and bring him round to their way of thinking. At Geyorkias' resting place, Zilva appears and reveals herself as the mastermind behind the incidents, declaring that she will use Geyorkias to destroy the Humas and create a Gajuma-ruled kingdom. After her defeat, the party revive Geyorkias: he in turn reveals that the force influencing Zilva and spreading hatred was in fact Yuris, and that Yuris has become a threat to the world. The group travel to confront Yuris, but are initially sapped of strength by its negative emotions. The growing positive emotions of the people of Karegia as the racial disputes fade give them the strength to destroy Yuris' core. Agarte then recovers her Force, returns herself and Claire to their original bodies, and summons the Sacred Beasts to destroy Yuris. The effort costs Agarte her life, and she leaves Karegia in Milhaust's charge and reveals her love for him before dying. The group then go their separate ways to resolve the remaining conflicts in the land.|$|E
5|$|Roughly a {{thousand}} {{years prior to the}} events of the series, Marceline was born to a demon lord named Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Martin Olson) and a human woman (voiced by Rebecca Sugar). Abadeer is the ruler of the Nightosphere—a Hell-like demon dimension—and subsists on the souls of sentient beings. For some reason, Marceline was left abandoned on Earth in events immediately following the Mushroom War, a mysterious war that ravaged the earth one thousand years prior to events of the series. During this time, Simon Petrikov—the name of the Ice King before he was overcome by the evil power of his crown—found Marceline in the ruins of a city and gave her a stuffed animal named Hambo to cheer her up. The two developed a caring relationship, although the crown took a toll on Simon's mental health, forcing him to leave Marceline alone. During this period in her life, she was reunited with her father, only to be disgusted by <b>his</b> <b>cold</b> and heartless ways. Although she attempted to tolerate his evil and selfish antics, she eventually severed all ties with Abadeer after she discovered him eating fries that she had made for herself. In the following years, Marceline roamed the land of Ooo and eventually befriended a tribe of humans. She became their guardian and ally, and she helped them kill vampires, who had taken over much of the land. Marceline soon discovered that, upon killing a vampire, she was able to acquire their unique abilities thanks to her demonic power to absorb souls. However, when she tried to fight the Vampire King himself, she was bitten. Although she eventually managed to slay him, she was turned in the process. At some point, she began a romantic relationship with a magician named Ash. The two would move into the Tree Fort, but their relationship would come to an end. Presumably, around this time, Marceline befriended Princess Bubblegum, the sovereign of the Candy Kingdom; the two would often avoid official royal meetings and explore the Candy Kingdom's elaborate rock candy mining complex. Eventually, due largely to the mounting stress of running her kingdom, Bubblegum pushed Marceline away, leaving an animosity between the two that lasted for a while.|$|E

After alienating <b>his</b> <b>cold,</b> unsympathetic colleagues and confiding to his elderly mother, he commits suicide by joyfully taking a running jump off the police station roof.|$|E
25|$|In the {{alternate}} timeline of the Flashpoint, Mr. Freeze attacks the S.T.A.R. Labs in Central City {{to find a}} cure for his wife Nora. However, Citizen Cold attacks and uses <b>his</b> <b>cold</b> gun to freeze Mr. Freeze's body. Mr. Freeze tries to escape on robotic legs, but Citizen Cold freezes him to death and tells him that Nora is dead. This version of Mr. Freeze is a friend of Fallout's, and pursues revenge against Citizen Cold for murdering him. It is later revealed that radiation produced by Fallout is the cure Mr. Freeze was searching for.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1980s, {{relations}} between Noriega and the United States began to deteriorate. In 1986, U.S. President Ronald Reagan opened negotiations with General Noriega, requesting that the Panamanian leader step down {{after he was}} publicly exposed in The New York Times by Seymour Hersh, and later exposed in the Iran-Contra Scandal. Reagan pressured him with several drug-related indictments in U.S. courts; however, since extradition laws between Panama and the U.S. were weak, Noriega deemed this threat not credible and did not submit to Reagan's demands. In 1988, Elliot Abrams {{and others in the}} Pentagon began pushing for a U.S. invasion, but Reagan refused, due to Bush's ties to Noriega through his previous positions in the CIA and the Task Force on Drugs, and their potentially negative impact on Bush's presidential campaign. Later negotiations involved dropping the drug-trafficking indictments. In March 1988, Noriega's forces resisted an attempted coup against the government of Panama. As relations continued to deteriorate, Noriega appeared to shift <b>his</b> <b>Cold</b> War allegiance towards the Soviet bloc, soliciting and receiving military aid from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Libya. American military planners began preparing contingency plans to invade Panama.|$|E

25|$|Fanta's older {{homosexual}} brother, {{and is a}} half-faerie like her. He shows extremely discriminative {{attitude towards}} all females except his sister, presumably because he had traumatic childhood relationship with <b>his</b> <b>cold</b> and distant mother. This also is implied to be the reason his romantic interests lie within males. He and his sister are close, {{even if they do}} argue sometimes like most siblings. Pain is the one who enchanted Ryang's skateboard (after hitting on him) so he could fight the evil affinities along with Fanta. Pain's best friend is Charon, the Prime Minister of Avalon and Medea's brother. Although the full extent of Pain's power is unknown, {{the fact that he has}} attained the position of Royal Inspector, a job which requires both power and precision, as well as being the only character seen so far that is able to hold off evil affinities. Like Fanta, he is much more powerful than the other inhabitants realize; as a child, he was able to detect Seraphina's spells when Charon and others could not. Pain also possesses powers to trace magical energy back to the original performer of magic.|$|E
25|$|The safety car {{remained}} on track for three laps, {{until it was}} withdrawn {{at the start of}} lap eleven and Jarvis kept the lead at the restart. Oshima tried an overtaking manoevure on Jarvis but became aware his tyres were too cold. Tsukakoshi overtook Asmer for the final podium position heading down to Mandarin Bend, and immediately set about on capitalising on Oshima's error. Grosjean made the restart in the field, moving up to eighth place. Kennard became the race's final retirement when he went into the barriers at Lisboa corner, possibly caused by him being caught off guard by <b>his</b> <b>cold</b> tyres. Tsukakoshi got a run on Oshima heading towards Mandarin Bend and executed an successful lunge to claim second place from his fellow countryman. Tsukakoshi then set himself after Jarvis while Mortara overtook Hartley to move into the top ten. Jarvis maintained the first position {{for the rest of the}} race to win the Grand Prix and led all of the laps contested. Tsukakoshi finished 1.7 seconds adrift in second, while fellow Japanese driver Oshima took third. Off the podium, Asmer could not catch Oshima and settled for fourth. Streit and Bird were close behind each other in fifth and sixth with Jakes in seventh. The top ten was rounded out by Grosjean, Jelley and Mortara. Outside the top ten, Buemi finished eleventh, having moved up seventeen from his starting position, and finished ahead of Hartley with Kobayashi 13th. He was ahead of Van Dam, Guerrieri, Izawa, Van Der Zande, Grubmüller, and local drivers Ávila, Lou Meng, Kit Meng, Merszei. Hülkenberg and Ho rounded out the top 24 classified finishers and were lapped by race winner Jarvis.|$|E
