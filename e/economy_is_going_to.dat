40|$|Both China and India {{were noted}} for their prowess and {{prosperity}} {{in the remote}} past, but {{in the recent past}} they went into a precipitous decline and became marginal economies, known for large impoverished masses and economic stagnation. Early in the 21 st century, China and India are once again being seen as two emerging economic powers of the global economy. The closing decades of the 20 th century were remarkable for both the economies. China in particular turned in a stellar economic performance. In the beginning of the 21 st century, it was even being seen as the economic super power of the future. It has emerged as a low-cost manufacturing juggernaut invading global markets in a sizeable array of products, with a high and rapidly rising level merchandise exports and imports. In comparison, India's post- 1991 growth performance has shown improvement. Although its success in the services sector exports is noteworthy, its economic performance did not match that of China.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel index to {{quantify}} and measure the flow of information on macro and micro scales. We discuss the implications of this index for knowledge management fields and also as intellectual capital that can thus be utilized by entrepreneurs. We explore different function and human oriented metrics that can be used at micro-scales to process the flow of information. We present a table of about 23 metrics, such as change in IT inventory and percentage of employees with advanced degrees, that can be used at micro scales to wholly quantify knowledge dispersion as intellectual capital. At macro scales we split the economy in an industrial and consumer sector where the flow of information in each determines how fast an <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> grow and how overall an economy will perform given the aggregate demand. Lastly, we propose a model for knowledge dispersion based on graph theory and show how corrections in the flow become self-evident. Through the principals of flow conservation and capacity constrains we also speculate how this flow might seeks some equilibrium and exhibit self-correction codes. This proposed model allows us to account for perturbations in form of local noise, evolution of networks, provide robustness against local damage from lower nodes, and help determine the underlying classification into network super-families. ...|$|E

In parallel with the technological and economic developments around the world, new concepts and a large number of new international markets have emerged on the internet. With this new form of fastgrowing commerce has been reached very considerable economic inputs and simplicities. Thus, the importance of the internet and e-commerce is an undeniable fact. The global marketplaces have been become significant as a bridge between all parties involved on the web trading platforms where buyers, sellers, retailers, wholesalers meet. Hereby, this dissertation was written in order to review the subjects of B 2 B and B 2 C. The primary purpose of this research is to analyze the usage of the internet and in European Union and Spain in terms of B 2 B and B 2 C international markets based on statistical data examining the growth in global internet economy by benchmarking EU and Spain performances.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an abbreviated {{version of the}} second part of the report on problems of Europe, prepared by a team of teachers at the University of Information Technology and Management in Rzeszow, Poland. We stress therein that the hotly debated problems of the Eurozone and the global financial crisis and its aftermath are, at best, medium-term ones, while real issues Europe faces are of the long-term nature and result from policies pursued for decades. Their consequences are also long-term – and increasingly harmful. Our diagnosis is as follows. Long-term problems related to the increasing burden of the welfare state and its side effects, like the slowing economic growth rate, are not subject to serious policy debates. It applies to both traditional elites from parties belonging to the moderate political spectrum, and to anti-elites on both extremes. Both elites and anti-elites reject the reality as a starting point to developing corrective policy measures. Our economic analysis has revealed that incentives to create wealth in old Western countries have been weakening for a long time. Yet, without deep cuts in public (especially welfare) expenditures and accompanying institutional reforms, economic performance of European (and generally Western) <b>economies</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> worsen over time. The chances of continued stagnation in the next 5 – 10 years are very high. Finally, we look at the socio-psychological behavioral framework of the ever-expanding welfare state. We point at the phenomenon of the learned helplessness which appears as a result of the people’s lacking perception of linkages between their actions and economic results of these actions. We interpret it as a consequence of the welfare state. It further weakens the prospects for successful reforms and the resultant avoidance of the long-term stagnation...|$|R

40|$|This item {{includes}} {{a segment of}} an an instructor interview in a Writing Intensive course in Upper Divison English at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The interview was conducted in 2014 and in this clip the interviewee is discussing issues of Asian settler colonialism in Hawaiʻi. Brief excerpt from interview: The difficulty for anybody is determining what is your kuleana, what is your responsibility, what is your area of expertise of authority to speak on a subject? We're trying to foreground positionality, trying to foreground relations of power and how we locate ourselves in those relations of power. So in writing about land, I ask students {{to think about it}} [...] . We all have kuleana, we just have to define what it is, and knowing our position [...] . that positioning is important. The problem happens when people don't recognize the differences between indigenous peoples and non-indigenous peoples and assume that we're all the same, and they don't understand land issues over ceded lands or seized lands. The big thing right now is the question of how the ceded lands are now called Public Trust lands. So who is the public, and who has a claim to that land? That's where you see the problem emerging, when there's not a distinction between who is indigenous and who is not. Indigeneity we define in terms of genealogy, not about blood quantum or that kind of thing. What are the stakes in all of this? You begin to see so much irony when people point Bishop Estate as being this landowner - this big bad land owner. But when they had a forced lease to fee-conversion law in place, who acquired the land? It was wealthy whites and Asians in Kahala and in the Hawaiʻi Kai area. They're the ones who gained land, so what is the irony there between this trust that's for a patrimony for Native Hawaiian children and who actually got the land? I think that's why positionality is so important, and I struggle with it when writing about land. I think we all struggle with it [...] . how not to make ourselves the center of it [...] . and how to be respectful. How we compare a capitalist economy with an indigenous <b>economy,</b> how one <b>is</b> based on accumulation of capital and how the other one is based on the production of food, how to grow food [...] . We do talk about the impact of globalization on these places. It's kind of creepy, the interconnectedness of it. Obama had a meeting of the APEC leaders here, right? So you have these countries that are trying to engage in this sort of neoliberal version of trade. You lift all the regulations protecting the environment and labor and land use laws. You lift all those protections in order to make that sort of free trade possible [...] . Then Abercrombie comes in with the PLDC, the Public Land and Development Corporation, and those kinds of ideas about developing lands and leasing land to these multinational corporations. So I try to get students to see those kinds of global-local connections. We're also talking about climate change [...] . Waiau is drying up. The lake's drying up [...] . and students sometimes are very depressed about that. I say well, we just do what we can. Protecting these places and learning about them and sharing that knowledge and making it publicly available - that's all part of a process. I think if people can see that there <b>are</b> alternative <b>economies</b> [...] . through mapping, what alternative economies can we decipher? These alternative <b>economies</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> really important in reenvisioning that kind of industrialization that's leading to that kind of climate chang...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{economic}} crisis and taxation in the advanced countries - especially in the European nations - are linked in several ways. The tax systems may have exacerbated the crisis, and this {{raises the question of}} the need for a better system of taxation in certain economic sectors, especially in the banking sector. It is worthwhile examining the various different effects of the crisis on different kinds of tax revenue, as a result of both the automatic stabilizers and the discretional measures which were adopted to sustain the <b>economies.</b> We <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> show that while the former have had a relatively substantial impact, the latter have been of negligible effect. The paper initially offers a critical overview of the just mentioned topics. The European countries are now faced with a difficult trade - off between further tax reductions to sustain economic recovery, and the raising of taxes in order to help stabilize public budgets and debts. Broadly speaking, the most suggested solution consists in the idea of raising taxes whilst making them more growth - friendly. With this in mind, the paper then reconsiders and compares the latest, authoritative proposals for tax reform which in recent years have been proposed not only by international economic organizations, but also by studies in the field. The longstanding principles of broadening the tax base, reducing rates and simplifying the tax system still appear to be at the order of the day. The idea of shifting the tax burden away from labour and capital, whilst increasing taxes on consumption, properties and environmental resources, has also received large support. It is again suggested that efficiency - induced neutrality should characterize the design of the main taxes. While those political factors that have impeded reforms in recent years are still at work, we should remember that tax systems also have other targets than that of favouring neutrality - efficiency, and that in some countries (including Italy) the most urgent, radical reform required is the downsizing of an abnormal level of tax evasion. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{serves as}} a {{critique}} against a recent American foreign policy formulation proposing to eradicate ‘warlordism’ and naively asserting that democratic institution can be directly created out of post-eradication anarchic chaos.

The majority commonly portray political actors as faithful followers of economic rationality and self-interest. Therefore, most are conceived as selfish predators who ruthlessly use violence for private gains {{at the expense of}} public interest.

Along the lines of patron–client network analysis, insights from moral economy and agency-structure sociological dualism are considered. Contrastive case studies will be used to illustrate how the alleged ‘warlords’ of Southeast Asia do not entirely fit into the political economy perspective. Caught in a vast patron–client network of competing interests and diverse powers across state and society, one’s agency is constantly constituted by discursive arrays of contending interests, juxtaposing rationalities and multiple intentions. In state building, this complication is regarded paradoxically necessary in compelling the alleged warlord-actor to redefine and elevate multiple private interests into public interest – the deployment of robust action...|$|R
40|$|The {{greatest}} {{obstacle to}} {{sound economic policy}} is not entrenched special interests or rampant lobbying, but the popular misconceptions, irrational beliefs, and personal biases held by ordinary voters. This is economist Bryan Caplan's sobering assessment in this provocative and eye-opening book. Caplan argues that voters continually elect politicians who either share their biases or else pretend to, resulting in bad policies winning again and again by popular demand. Boldly calling into question our most basic assumptions about American politics, Caplan contends that democracy fails precisely because it does what voters want. Through an analysis of Americans' voting behavior and opinions {{on a range of}} economic issues, he makes the convincing case that noneconomists suffer from four prevailing biases: they underestimate the wisdom of the market mechanism, distrust foreigners, undervalue the benefits of conserving labor, and pessimistically believe the <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> from bad <b>to</b> worse. Caplan lays out several bold ways to make democratic government work better [...] for example, urging economic educators to focus on correcting popular misconceptions and recommending that democracies do less and let markets take up the slack. The Myth of the Rational Voter takes an unflinching look at how people who vote under the influence of false beliefs ultimately end up with government that delivers lousy results. With the upcoming presidential election season drawing nearer, this thought-provoking book is sure to spark a long-overdue reappraisal of our elective system. popular misconceptions, irrational beliefs, personal biases, ordinary voters, market mechanism, elective system...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. economy {{continues}} to face substantial turmoil. Financial markets are under unusual stress. Wall Street has been racked by seismic change. Uncertainty over the future prospects for the U. S. economy has caused consumers and businesses to pull back on discretionary consumption and investment spending. Doubts concerning the true value of complex securities continue to weigh heavily on financial markets worldwide. The stilluncertain fate of housing markets has kept {{the value of the}} underlying mortgage assets obscured. The Federal Reserve has been active and innovative in responding to the evolving turmoil during 2008. In addition to deploying interest rate cuts, the Fed has implemented a series of new and unconventional tools. This innovation has intensified in response to evolving market events. There may be many more twists and turns in the policy response going forward. I will discuss the challenges my Federal Reserve colleagues and I face as we strive to implement a policy that is designed to deliver low and stable inflation along with maximum sustainable employment. I will describe three funerals and a wedding—that is, three ideas about the U. S. <b>economy</b> that may <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> their final resting place and one idea that, once left for dead, may be taking on a new life. I will keep you in suspense about what ideas I have in mind. As always, any views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect the official views of other Federal Open Market Committee members...|$|R
