I lived in Leeds {{for a year}} and I used to hear to kids {{listening}} to instrumentals on their phones, rapping over the top. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that sounds: the texture of super compressed digital beats coming out of a cellphone and just a voice over it. Far Side Virtual was inspired by hearing music like that." ...|$|E

It’s so honest, {{and you have a}} baby that is screaming and crying when she is supposed to be smiling and happy in the scene, and we have to just go, go, go, [...] and it becomes real and natural. [...] I like being mom for ten minutes and then handing them back." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ahana Bhattacharya of Koimoi {{gave the}} film 2.5/5 saying, [...] "The story is funny {{and the film}} has some really hilarious dialogues. However, sardar jokes are a bit clichéd and Bollywood needs to get over it. <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> film builds up the {{confusion}} but it tends to drag towards the climax. Their are moments when you will feel it is patriarchal, racist and regressive. Also, the climax is a bit predictable.|$|R

And you know, just the way I would sing it versus in the way Toni Braxton would sing it. And <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it came out, and I think probably the rest of the band really does not like it, and that’s probably why it didn’t make our fifth record, in 2005 when we were recording it." ...|$|E
500|$|Tyler {{attended}} the Congressional Schools of Virginia, Breakwater School, and Waynflete School in Portland, Maine, {{before returning to}} New York City with her mother at age 12. She went to York Preparatory in New York City for {{junior high and high}} school after her mother researched the school to accommodate Tyler's ADHD. She graduated in 1995 and left to continue her acting career. [...] When asked about the way she spent her youth, Tyler said: [...] "For me, I didn’t get much of a childhood in my teen years because I’ve been working since I was 14. But that also kept me out of trouble. When everybody was doing acid and partying like crazy, I was at work on a movie in Tuscany... having my own fun, of course, but it was a different kind of thing. I have no regrets. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> my life has gone." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon release, critics {{gave the}} song {{generally}} positive reviews. MacKenzie Wilson, {{in his review}} from Allmusic, notes, [...] "Coldplay's indie rock inclinations are also obvious, especially on songs such as 'Don't Panic' and 'Shiver'." [...] In the Pitchfork Media review, Spencer Owen writes, [...] "This subdued, dreamy opener contains Martin's falsetto chorus of 'We live in a beautiful world,' which seems to sum up the overall sentiment of the record." [...] Robert Christgau alleged that, along with [...] "Yellow", the song {{was one of only}} two good ones on all of Parachutes. Critic Adrian Denning, in his review of the album, compliments, [...] "Both the vocals and guitar are utterly beautiful. It's a song to take solace from, draw comfort from, be quietly awed by." [...] David DeVoe of Hybridmagazine.com wrote: [...] "It is a wonderful song that echoes the promise of what is to come {{on the rest of the}} record. 'Don’t Panic' is filled with excellent guitar tones and a nice grooving back beat, and <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the song ends." ...|$|E

And <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> 45s sounded. They were so much louder, like a punch in the face." ...|$|R
500|$|Case, who had {{previously}} worked on the soap operas General Hospital and As the World Turns, was cast in August 1994. She was selected {{from a group of}} six other possible recasts after a screen testing with co-star Joshua Morrow, and began airing on September 7, 1994. Initially, Case believed she would only be playing the role for a maximum of six months. Of her casting, she stated: [...] "Not only is this my third soap, but I'm also the third actress {{to play the role of}} Sharon Collins. So, if three times is the charm, this should be it." [...] The actress wanted to [...] "breathe new life" [...] into the role and make it her own. In 2003, Case was off-screen from February 17 to May 1, during contract negotiations. These were resolved that April, when she signed a new contract to remain on the show for another four years, until 2007. Case revealed that while she considered leaving the series, [...] "I would not have been negotiating if I did not want to come back. I've always had a great story to play. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they write Sharon. It was just a matter of hammering out the deal points." ...|$|E
500|$|Pete Rock said of {{his studio}} {{experience}} with West, [...] "He's definitely hip-hop, his roots, I was testing him on joints...He takes it to another level which is dope. He had these musicians and this song, they played around my little raggedy beat and made it real. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he works — he goes from one room, writing rhymes then goes to another beat and goes to another room and does something else — I love what he's done". Rapper Pusha T characterized the album as [...] "a collage of sounds" [...] and found West's methods unorthodox when recording, saying that [...] "We could easily be working on one song, thinking we're in a mode, and he'll hear a sound from someone like [...] Jeff Bhasker and immediately turn his whole attention to that sound and go through his mental Rolodex to where that sound belongs on his album, and then it goes straight to that song, immediately". DJ Premier said of the production in comparison to West's previous work, [...] "Well, first of all, {{if you look at}} all of Kanye West's output, he actually did a lot to bring back sampling and make it cool again, even though he's more of a mainstream artist...but his new album is strictly hard beats and rhyme. He's totally done with electro. You're gonna be surprised what you hear".|$|E
500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I think might benefit from an extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E

After reading the book, I started experimenting with placing animals in cityscapes, both the kind that are found in cities (dogs and cats) and those that exist in Johannesburg only as metaphors - sharks and crocodiles, for example. I’ve used a limited palette of black, grey and red to evoke the dystopian atmosphere of the city, its grey grittiness a contrast to throbbing red life.|$|R

50|$|Born in Casablanca on February 22 1936, Joseph Ettedgui {{was the son}} of a French-Moroccan {{furniture}} retailer of Jewish ancestry. Joseph’s father considered retailing to be a degrading {{profession and}} hoped his son would become a doctor or lawyer. Joseph had no such ambitions and moved to London with his brother Maurice in 1960 to train as a hairdresser. Two years later the brothers opened a hairdressing salon (Salon 33) in King's Road, Chelsea - one of the epicentres of Swinging London. In 1964, their brother Franklin joined them. In an interview in 1989 with the Jewish Chronicle, Joseph said: “I really wanted to be an architect but I'm terribly impatient.
