Kinsey's textbook was noteworthy for the strong position it took on evolution...In his textbook Kinsey laid out the basic facts of evolution in a manner-of-fact matter, {{as though he were}} discussing the life cycle of the fruit fly. ... The chapter called [...] "Further Evidence of Change" [...] was especially blunt...Kinsey defined evolution as [...] "the scientific word for change", and while he acknowledged that {{there are some people who}} [...] "think they don't believe in evolution", he tried to show his students the folly of such reasoning. To find proof of evolution, students had only to look things they used daily...Kinsey ridiculed the man who denounced evolution but owned a new breed of dog or smoked a cigar made from a recently <b>improved</b> <b>variety</b> of tobacco, saying, [...] "When he says he doesn't believe in evolution, I wonder what he means." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{theory of}} natural {{selection}} is grounded {{on the belief that}} each new variety, and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by having some advantage over those with which it comes into competition; and the consequent extinction of less-favoured forms almost inevitably follows. It is the same with our domestic productions: when a new and slightly <b>improved</b> <b>variety</b> has been raised, it at first supplants the less improved varieties in the same neighbourhood; when much improved it is transported far and near, like our short-horn cattle, and takes the place of other breeds in other countries. Thus the appearance of new forms and the disappearance of old forms, both natural and artificial, are bound together. In certain flourishing groups, the number of new specific forms which have been produced within a given time is probably greater than that of the old forms which have been exterminated; but we know that the number of species has not gone on indefinitely increasing, at least during the later geological periods, so that looking to later times we may believe that the production of new forms has caused the extinction of about the same number of old forms.|$|E
60|$|In {{the case}} of methodical selection, a breeder selects for some {{definite}} object, and if the individuals be allowed freely to intercross, his work will completely fail. But when many men, without intending to alter the breed, have a nearly common standard of perfection, and all try to procure and breed from the best animals, improvement surely but slowly follows from this unconscious process of selection, notwithstanding {{that there is no}} separation of selected individuals. Thus it will be under nature; for within a confined area, with some place in the natural polity not perfectly occupied, all the individuals varying in the right direction, though in different degrees, will tend to be preserved. But if the area be large, its several districts will almost certainly present different conditions of life; and then, if the same species undergoes modification in different districts, the newly formed varieties will intercross on the confines of each. But we shall see in the sixth chapter that intermediate varieties, inhabiting intermediate districts, will in the long run generally be supplanted by one of the adjoining varieties. Intercrossing will chiefly affect those animals which unite for each birth and wander much, and which do not breed at a very quick rate. Hence with animals of this nature, for instance birds, varieties will generally be confined to separated countries; and this I find to be the case. With hermaphrodite organisms which cross only occasionally, and likewise with animals which unite for each birth, but which wander little and can increase at a rapid rate, a new and <b>improved</b> <b>variety</b> might be quickly formed on any one spot, and might there maintain itself in a body and afterward spread, so that the individuals of the new variety would chiefly cross together. On this principle nurserymen always prefer saving seed from a large body of plants, as the chance of intercrossing is thus lessened.|$|E
30|$|The above {{adoption}} {{rates are}} based on full sample of farmers that included three groups; thus, (i) non-pigeonpea growers, (ii) pigeonpea growers that did not adopt <b>improved</b> <b>varieties,</b> and (iii) pigeonpea growers that adopted <b>improved</b> <b>varieties.</b> Therefore the results on potential adoption rates measure the adoption probability of <b>improved</b> pigeonpea <b>varieties</b> by a farmer randomly selected for a population composed {{of the three groups}} described above.|$|R
40|$|High {{rates of}} outcrossing make it {{difficult}} to obtain accurate adoption rates of <b>improved</b> <b>varieties</b> for often cross-pollinated crops. We developed and tested a protocol for identification of <b>improved</b> <b>varieties</b> of pigeonpea in northern Tanzania. The study was conducted in the 2012 season, in collaboration with the Selian Agricultural Research Institute (SARI) and covered 34 villages in 6 districts, for 704 cases. Each sample of pigeonpea plant was identified twice, once by the farmer and once by the enumerator using the protocol. A sub-sample of 51 plants was photographed in the field for later identification by experts. For <b>improved</b> <b>varieties,</b> the convergence between the farmers’ identification and the protocol was 74 percent. For local varieties, the convergence was 65 percent. For mixed varieties, the convergence was only 33 percent. We also compared the identification of <b>improved</b> <b>varieties</b> using the protocol with visual identification by pigeonpea experts using the photographs of the 51 sampled plants. The convergence between the experts’ identification and the revised protocol ranged from 41 to 71 percent. A simulation exercise based on a revised protocol significantly increased this convergence, but it remained below 90 percent. Hence, accurate identification of <b>improved</b> <b>varieties</b> of pigeonpea is more complex than previously thought. Protocols based on phenotypic traits are a potential {{solution to the problem of}} identifying <b>improved</b> <b>varieties</b> in self-pollinated crops, but more reliable protocols are needed to improve the accuracy of adoption rates for <b>improved</b> pigeonpea <b>varieties</b> in Tanzania...|$|R
40|$|If dryland legumes are to {{meet the}} {{expectations}} of reducing poverty and hunger in the semi-Arid Tropics, there will be need for a full understanding of their potential for diffusion and the barriers to adoption. We apply a program evaluation technique to data obtained from Tanzania to derive estimates of the actual and potential adoption rates of <b>improved</b> pigeonpea <b>varieties</b> and their determinants. The study reveals that only 33 % of the sampled farmers were aware of the <b>improved</b> pigeonpea <b>varieties</b> which consequently restricted the sample adoption rate of <b>improved</b> <b>varieties</b> to only 19 %. The potential adoption rate of improved pigeonpea if all farmers had been exposed to <b>improved</b> <b>varieties</b> is estimated at 62 % and the adoption gap resulting from the incomplete exposure of the population to the improved pigeonpea is 43 %. We further find that the awareness of <b>improved</b> <b>varieties</b> is mainly influenced by attendance of Participatory Variety Selection activities. The adoption of <b>improved</b> <b>varieties</b> is more pronounced among farmers with smaller landholdings suggesting that farmers facing land pressure intensify pigeonpea production through the adoption of <b>improved</b> high yielding <b>varieties.</b> The findings are indicative of the relatively large demand for <b>improved</b> pigeonpea <b>varieties</b> suggesting that there is scope for increasing their adoption rate in Tanzania once the farmers are made aware of the existence of the technologies. ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{conspicuous}} {{deviations of}} structure occur rarely, {{the improvement of}} each breed is generally {{the result of the}} selection of slight individual differences. Hence the closest attention, the sharpest powers of observation, and indomitable perseverance, are indispensable. It is, also, highly important that many individuals of the breed which is to be improved should be raised; for thus there will be a better chance of the appearance of variations in the right direction, and individuals varying in an unfavourable manner may be freely rejected or destroyed. But {{that a large number of}} individuals should be raised, it is necessary that the conditions of life should favour the propagation of the species. Had the peacock been reared as easily as the fowl, we should probably ere this have had many distinct races. We see the importance of a large number of plants, from the fact of nursery gardeners almost always beating amateurs in the exhibition of new varieties. In 1845 it was estimated (21/43. Gardener's Chronicle' 1845 page 273.) that between 4000 and 5000 pelargoniums were annually raised from seed in England, yet a decidedly <b>improved</b> <b>variety</b> is rarely obtained. At Messrs. Carter's grounds, in Essex, where such flowers as the Lobelia, Nemophila, Mignonette, etc., are grown by the acre for seed, [...] "scarcely a season passes without some new kinds being raised, or some improvement effected on old kinds." [...] (21/44. 'Journal of Horticulture' 1862 page 157.) At Kew, as Mr. Beaton remarks, where many seedlings of common plants are raised, [...] "you see new forms of Laburnums, Spiraeas, and other shrubs." [...] (21/45. 'Cottage Gardener' 1860 page 368.) So with animals: Marshall (21/46. 'A Review of Reports' 1808 page 406.), in speaking of the sheep in one part of Yorkshire, remarks, [...] "as they belong to poor people, and are mostly in small lots, they never can be improved." [...] Lord Rivers, when asked how he succeeded in always having first-rate greyhounds, answered, [...] "I breed many, and hang many." [...] This, as another man remarks, [...] "was the secret of his success; and the same will be found in exhibiting fowls,-- successful competitors breed largely, and keep the best." [...] (21/47. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1853 page 45.) ...|$|E
60|$|In man's methodical selection, a breeder selects {{for some}} {{definite}} object, and free intercrossing will wholly stop his work. But when many men, without intending {{to alter the}} breed, have a nearly common standard of perfection, and all try to get and breed from the best animals, much improvement and modification surely but slowly follow from this unconscious process of selection, notwithstanding {{a large amount of}} crossing with inferior animals. Thus it will be in nature; for within a confined area, with some place in its polity not so perfectly occupied as might be, natural selection will always tend to preserve all the individuals varying in the right direction, though in different degrees, so as better to fill up the unoccupied place. But if the area be large, its several districts will almost certainly present different conditions of life; and then if natural selection be modifying and improving a species in the several districts, there will be intercrossing with the other individuals of the same species on the confines of each. And in this case the effects of intercrossing can hardly be counterbalanced by natural selection always tending to modify all the individuals in each district in exactly the same manner to the conditions of each; for in a continuous area, the conditions will generally graduate away insensibly from one district to another. The intercrossing will most affect those animals which unite for each birth, which wander much, and which do not breed at a very quick rate. Hence in animals of this nature, for instance in birds, varieties will generally be confined to separated countries; and this I believe to be the case. In hermaphrodite organisms which cross only occasionally, and likewise in animals which unite for each birth, but which wander little and which can increase at a very rapid rate, a new and <b>improved</b> <b>variety</b> might be quickly formed on any one spot, and might there maintain itself in a body, so that whatever intercrossing took place would be chiefly between the individuals of the same new variety. A local variety when once thus formed might subsequently slowly spread to other districts. On the above principle, nurserymen always prefer getting seed from a large body of plants of the same variety, as the chance of intercrossing with other varieties is thus lessened.|$|E
60|$|The creolla is {{no doubt}} the {{descendant}} of the fowl originally introduced about three centuries ago by the first colonists in La Plata, and has probably not only been uncrossed with any other <b>improved</b> <b>variety,</b> such as are now fast taking its place, and has lived a much freer life than is usual with the fowl in Europe. It is a rather small, lean, extremely active bird, lays about a dozen eggs, and hatches them all, and is of a yellowish red colour--a hue which is common, I believe, in the old barn-door fowl of England. The creolla fowl is strong on the wing, and much more carnivorous and rapacious in habits than other breeds; mice, frogs, and small snakes are eagerly hunted and devoured by it. At my home on the pampas {{a number of these}} fowls were kept, and were allowed to range freely about the plantation, which was large, and the adjacent grounds, where there were thickets of giant cardoon thistle, red-weed, thorn apple, &c. They always nested at a distance from the house, and it was almost impossible ever to find their eggs, on account of the extreme circumspection they observed in going to and from their nests; and when they succeeded in escaping foxes, skunks, weasels, and opossums, which, strange to say, they often did, they would rear their chickens away out of sight and hearing of the house, and only bring them home when winter deprived them of their leafy covering and made food scarce. During the summer, in my rambles about the plantation, T would occasionally surprise one of these half-wild hens with her brood; her distracted screams and motions would then cause her chicks to scatter and vanish in all directions, and, until the supposed danger was past, they would lie as close and well-concealed as young partridges. These fowls in summer always lived in small parties, each party composed of one cock and as many hens as he could collect--usually three or four. Each family occupied its own feeding ground, where it would pass a greater portion of each day. The hen would nest at a considerable distance from the feeding ground, sometimes as far as four or five hundred yards away. After laying an egg she would quit the nest, not walking from it as other fowls do, but flying, the flight extending to a distance of from fifteen to about fifty yards; after which, still keeping silence, she would walk or run, until, arrived at the feeding ground, she would begin to cackle. At once the cock, if within hearing, would utter a responsive cackle, whereupon she would run to him and cackle no more. Frequently the cackling call-note would not be uttered {{more than two or three}} times, sometimes only once, and in a much lower tone than in fowls of other breeds.|$|E

50|$|Food {{distribution}} in Latin America is mainly dominated by large distributors and chains. Efforts {{have been made}} to compete with the industrialization of the food distribution system through the establishment of four types of organizations: consumer purchasing organizations, consumer cooperatives, voluntary chains, and retailer purchasing associations.

Consumer cooperatives differ from consumer purchasing organizations in that they are constituted by groups of individuals who work together to secure high quality food for low prices.

Voluntary chains are organizations of privately-owned retailers and food wholesalers who operate as one economic body.

40|$|One {{local variety}} (local landrace) and one <b>improved</b> <b>variety</b> of sorghum PARC SS- 1 were {{subjected}} to farmers` production practice and improved production technology at National Agricultural Research Centre Islamabad, during the summer seasons of 1997 and 1998. Significant differences were found among the treatments for days to flowering, plant height, insect and disease score, grain and stover yields. Interaction only for grain yield was significant. Flowering was enhanced by three days when improved method of production was used. Where farmers` method was applied, flowering delayed by five days which shows that with application of inputs, flowering was enhanced. Plant height of both local and improved varieties was increased significantly with application of fertilizer and other inputs. The <b>improved</b> <b>variety</b> was more resistant (2. 5) than the local variety (4. 5) with regard to shootfly infestation. Similarly the <b>improved</b> <b>variety</b> was found more resistant (1. 0) to foliar diseases than the local variety (4. 0). Where either farmers` or <b>improved</b> <b>variety</b> was used with farmers` practice, the plots were heavily infested with weeds.

When complete improved package of production technology (<b>improved</b> <b>variety</b> + recommended doses of fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides and optimum plant density) was adopted, it gave significantly higher grain (2472 kg ha - 1) and stover (21. 3 t ha - 1) yields.

Plant height of both local and improved varieties was increased significantly with application of fertilizer and other inputs.

When the same varieties were subjected to primextra herbicide @ 0. 50 kg ha - 1 (a. i) the weeds remained controlled as compared to the ones with no herbicide. The higher grain and stover yields are attributed to the application of primextra herbicide.

40|$|The {{effects of}} soil {{inoculation}} with A. flavus, variety and cropping {{system on the}} level of aflatoxin in stored maize were investigated under crop storage conditions in Benin. The experiment was organized in a factorial scheme (two varieties x two cropping system x with or without A. flavus soil inoculation) with eight treatments carried out in a completely randomized block design with three replications. A. flavus incidence in the plots soil was assessed both before and after soil inoculation. The harvested maize was stored for four months and cobs were sampled in a monthly interval and analyzed for the determination of Fusarium spp. colonization, Penicillium spp. and A. flavus cfu levels, insect pests population size and aflatoxin content. Multi-factorial analysis of variance and linear regression analyses with dummy variables were used to compare treatments. The concentrations of aflatoxin B 1 and B 2 in the kernels tended to increase with time during storage. Variety and fungal inoculation were the main factors influencing the levels of aflatoxins in stored maize. The <b>improved</b> <b>variety</b> showed a higher number of A. flavus cfu and aflatoxin B 1 and B 2 levels as compared to the local variety. Intercropping with Vigna unguiculata decreased the aflatoxin concentration in the <b>improved</b> <b>variety</b> but not in the local variety. The local variety had higher levels of Penicillium spp. and lower levels of Fusarium spp. than the <b>improved</b> <b>variety.</b> The treatments had no effect on the populations of the most common storage insect pests, but their levels were positively correlated with aflatoxin content. Both the initial inoculum level and the variety effect on the water content of the kernels after harvest {{played a significant role in}} A. flavus infection...|$|E
40|$|The study {{analyzed}} {{the impact of}} adoption of <b>improved</b> groundnut <b>varieties</b> on farm inputs demand and productivity using instrumental variables approach. The data was collected from a simple random sample of 161 groundnut farmers in Eastern Uganda. Econometric results show significant increase in expenditure on improved seed and labor among adopters relative to the non-adopters. Adoption of <b>improved</b> <b>varieties</b> significantly increased groundnuts yield, by about 1688 kg per hectare. Thus, more effort is needed to increase farmers’ access to <b>improved</b> <b>varieties.</b> The Government and partners should facilitate the development of local seed multiplication systems {{to reduce the cost}} of improved seed [...] Production Economics, Productivity Analysis, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies,...|$|R

The Mexican variety was crossed {{with the older}} black-seeded species to make <b>improved</b> <b>varieties</b> that made the state of Mississippi famous. The most noted cotton varieties (Belle Creole, Jethro, Parker, and Petit Gulf) were bred in Mississippi.|$|R

Major chickpeaproducing area is the central dry zone which contributes 96 % of the chickpea production. Kabuli chickpea is mainly grown for export, while desi chickpea is for local consumption. Eight <b>improved</b> <b>varieties</b> of chickpea (5 desi and 3 kabuli) have been released in Myanmar. The adoption of <b>improved</b> <b>varieties</b> and <b>improved</b> crop production practices has led to remarkable increase in chickpea yields and production...|$|R
