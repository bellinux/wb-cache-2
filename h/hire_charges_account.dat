50|$|In 1914, Western Union {{opened the}} first <b>charge</b> <b>account</b> for its {{customers}} and {{provided them with}} a paper identification. There were many larger department stores which opened store <b>charge</b> <b>accounts</b> for their customers with paper identification, enabling the customer to make purchases on credit provided by the store. However, these accounts could be used only within the store which issued them. In 1950, Diners Club began opening <b>charge</b> <b>accounts</b> with paper identification cards, directed at the travel and entertainment markets. The novel feature of these cards was that the charge card {{could be used in}} a large number of stores. These stores had to enter an agreement with Diners Club, and pay a fee to the company. For the fee, Diners Club carried the cost of setting up accounts, authorizing each transaction, processing transactions and collections, bore the financing costs and assumed the risk of cardholders defaulting. The new system was especially appealing to smaller stores in competition with the larger stores but who could not justify setting up their own <b>charge</b> <b>account</b> facilities. Eventually the larger stores began accepting these cards, testifying that the fees charged by the card operator were lower than the store's cost in running their own store accounts. In 1957, American Express also entered the field, and in 1959 was the first company to issue embossed plastic charge cards to ISO/IEC 7810 standards.|$|R

Each charge coin usually had a little hole, enabling it to be put in a key ring, like a key. These charge coins were usually given to customers who had <b>charge</b> <b>accounts</b> in department stores, hotels, and so on. A charge coin usually had the <b>charge</b> <b>account</b> number along with the merchant's name and logo.|$|R

Today grid research is mostly focus on the communication, security, resource manangement and information management. <b>Charging</b> and <b>accounting</b> is a base activity in a economy society, so that it should {{become a part of}} grid computing system in computational economy environment. In this paper, we introduce <b>charging</b> and <b>accounting</b> item in a grid computing system, and propose a method for calculating the cost of a grid usage. This method gives out how to calculate the standardization technology cost of the usage of a job and how to translate the standardization technology cost into currency cost. Further more, we analyse the demands of a <b>charging</b> and <b>accounting</b> system in a computional economy based grid. A architecture of <b>charging</b> and <b>accounting</b> system and its support system is designed in this paper. ...|$|R

The Company, and not Broome, had been paying the locomotive <b>hire</b> <b>charges</b> and it is likely that they had taken responsibility for a number of other costs not properly specified in Pain's contract arrangements. The financial crisis could be averted, they felt, if the line could soon be opened, on 17 July.
