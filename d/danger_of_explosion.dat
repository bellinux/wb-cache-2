[...] Of this depth, only the top [...] had been fitted with a steel conductor casing; the rest was to be fitted with one once the drill bit was out. [...] After the workers pulled the drill bit out, with some difficulty, an enormous spout of oil, gas, and drilling mud burst into the air into the rig, splattering the men with filth; several of them attempted to screw a blowout-preventer onto the pipe, but against a pressure of over , this proved to be impossible; all workers except for those engaged in the plugging attempt were evacuated, due to the <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>explosion</b> from the abundant natural gas blown from the hole; finally, the workers tried the method of last resort, dropping the remaining drill pipe – almost [...] long – into the hole, and then crushing {{the top of the}} well pipe from the sides with a pair of [...] "blind rams", enormous steel blocks slamming together with force sufficient to stop anything from escaping from the well.

50|$|Difluoroacetylene, C2F2, is a {{compound}} of carbon and fluorine. A linear molecule, its two carbons are joined by a triple bond and have terminal fluorines: F-C≡C-F.

Toner is composed various materials, iron, carbon and other organic materials, and which sizes are mostly less than 10 μm (in diameter). Dust explosions sometimes occurred during usage, manufacture and recycled of toner cartridges. And recently toner powder size becomes much smaller, and more <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> dust <b>explosion.</b> In Japan we experienced incidents <b>of</b> dust <b>explosion</b> at toner cartridge manufacture and recycle facilities and other places. Therefore author studied its <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> dust <b>explosion</b> using new and recycled toners with various dust explosion tests, {{such as the}} minimum ignition energy test and the 30 L explosion bomb test.

30|$|During {{manufacturing}} or {{storage of}} ENM, fire {{is a possible}} hazard, which can result in the release of ENM into air (when stored as powder) as well as into water/wastewater (ENM dispersions). The cause for the accident can be internal (e.g., technical) as well as external factors. Deflagration is possible for metallic ENM, but they are usually stored in dispersion and/or under inert atmosphere. An example is nano-zero-valent iron for which also hydrogen production and the <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen <b>explosion</b> need to be considered.|$|R
