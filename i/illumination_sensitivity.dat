For {{samples of the}} same material with different passivation, the difference in sheet resistance of illuminated and non-illuminated material can be as large as 130 % (for annealed heterostructure without passivation) and as small as 3 % (for heterostructure passivated with low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) silicon nitride). The time constant for the decay of the persistent photoconductance (PPC) is also very different for the differently processed samples. The majority of {{the effect on the}} conductance is from photons with energies between 3. 1 and 3. 7 eV. The investigation indicates that delayed recombination of electrons emitted from surface states and from deep level states in the AlGaN layer dominates the PPC. A theory is formulated by which the difference in <b>illumination</b> <b>sensitivity</b> for the differently passivated materials can be explained by different distributions of electrons between the channel two dimensional electron gas and an accumulation layer formed in the cap layer. For practical heterostructure field effect transistor (HFET) measurements, the <b>illumination</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is generally lower than that of the Hall measurements.

In [1], a system reads data from Kinect and expresses it as 3 D point cloud then the floor plane and the occupancy of the volume in front of the user are detected. The occupancy represents an obstacle. In [9], the authors proposed a method combining depth and color. First, the depth map is denoised using dilation and erosion morphological operations. Then, least squares method is applied to approximate ground curves and to determine the ground height. The obstacles are decided based on the dramatic change in the depth value. Finally, object labeling is carried out with region-growing technique. Color information is used for edge detection and staircase identification. In [24], Vlaminck et al. presented a method for static obstacle detection consisting of four steps: point cloud registration, plane segmentation, ground and wall detection and obstacle detection.

However, their system is time consuming because of normal estimation and plane segmentation using RANSAC on 3 D point cloud {{takes a lot of time}} to process.

When {{the materials are}} joined into the AlGaN/GaN heterostructure a 2 -dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) with a high electron density as well as high electron mobility is generated. The combination of high electron density with high mobility and high breakdown field results in excellent power handling capability at high frequencies. These inherently virtuous physical properties are utilized by the GaN-based heterostructure field effect transistor (HFET) technology. This thesis deals with developing appropriate fabrication processes for AlGaN/GaN HFETs by basic material characterization methods. The main {{focus is on the}} passivation of the heterostructure surface, which is notorious for its effect on device performance. Several examples of the effect of the passivation process on the electrical properties of the heterostructure are presented. For example, it is shown that passivating a heterostructure using a non optimized plasma based deposition method may redistribute more than 90 % of the channel electrons to a barrier accumulation layer. The use of metal-insulator-semiconducting-heterostructure (MISH) capacitor analysis for extracting interface states is described in detail. Based on a comparison of different passivation methods the low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) silicon nitride () emerges as a suitable candidate for passivation of AlGaN/GaN heterostructures. In this thesis the effects of different LPCVD deposition parameters are investigated. Furthermore, LPCVD passivation will produce devices that are less sensitive to illumination.

Both EGTA and saturating doses of cyclic GMP block the light response, but only cyclic GMP increases response latency, which suggests that if calcium is involved in transduction, it is controlled by the hydrolysis of cyclic GMP. After brief pulses of cyclic AMP, a new steady state of increased depolarization occasionally develops. The effects described above also occur under these conditions.

After a bright flash, the ERP amplitude recovered {{with a time}} constant of 100 ms, whereas the sensitivity recovered with an initial time constant of 20 s. When a strong adapting light was turned off, the recovery of membrane potential and of membrane resistance had time-courses similar to each other, and both recovered more rapidly than the sensitivity. The receptor depolarization was compared during dark adaptation after strong illumination and during light adaptation with weaker illumination; at equal sensitivities the cell was more depolarized during light adaptation than during dark adaptation. Finally, the waveforms of responses to flashes were compared during dark adaptation after strong illumination and during light adaptation with weaker <b>illumination.</b> At equal <b>sensitivities</b> (equal amplitude responses for identical flashes), the responses during light adaptation had faster time-courses than the responses during dark adaptation.
