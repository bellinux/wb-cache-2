25|$|Royer {{attended}} the first International Congress on Woman’s Rights in 1878 {{but did not}} speak. For the Congress in 1889 she was asked by Maria Deraismes, to chair the historical section. In <b>her</b> <b>address</b> she argued that the immediate introduction of women's suffrage was {{likely to lead to}} an increase {{in the power of the}} church and that the first priority should be to establish secular education for women. Similar elitist views were held by many French feminists at the time who feared a return to the monarchy with its strong links to the conservative Roman Catholic Church.|$|E

In the hospital, Malina was treated for internal bleeding, which police authorities ascertain occurred before the claimed attack.|$|E
25|$|News of {{the verdict}} drew {{widespread}} comment and criticism in the Scottish press. Such was the level of public and media interest {{in the outcome of}} the case, on 13 September 2007 the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament took the unusual step of allowing the then Lord Advocate, Elish Angiolini, to address parliament on the matter. The Lord Advocate read a prepared statement to the chamber setting out the narrative of the Crown case and explaining her reasoning for deciding to prosecute. She is recorded in the official transcript of <b>her</b> <b>address</b> as saying that she was 'disappointed' with the result, and that she 'was of the clear opinion that the evidence that was made available to the court was sufficient to put before the jury to allow it the opportunity to decide on the case against Sinclair'.|$|E
25|$|On July 19, 2010, Shirley Sherrod {{was fired}} from her {{appointed}} position as Georgia State Director of Rural Development for the United States Department of Agriculture. Her firing was an administration reaction to media reports on video excerpts from <b>her</b> <b>address</b> to an event of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in March 2010 and commentary posted by conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart on his website. Based on these excerpts, the NAACP condemned Sherrod's remarks as racist and US government officials called on the official to resign. However, review of her full speech showed that the excerpts had been selectively edited, and that her remarks – understood in context – were {{about the importance of}} overcoming personal prejudices. The NAACP and White House officials then apologized for their earlier criticisms, and United States Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack apologized for the firing and offered Sherrod a new position.|$|E

She seems to be interested in the trio, particularly Hidenori, who has the most encounters with her and amuses her with novelly lines the most (or at least, tries to). She's also extremely clumsy, over imaginative, and often making a fool of herself.

25|$|Carl {{arrives at}} Bianca Butcher's (Patsy Palmer) house, after she {{telephones}} him thinking his number {{belonged to her}} father David Wicks (Michael French). Bianca assumes Carl is the plumber, but when the real plumber arrives, Carl says he is the friend of Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) that Bianca called. He learns that Derek is dead, and claims to know his daughter Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks), so Bianca gives him <b>her</b> <b>address.</b> He visits Alice, who gives him the box that contained the phone number, which Alice says was found by Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Bianca's friend Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) realises that Carl lied about knowing Alice and warns Alice and Bianca {{to be wary of}} him. Carl visits Ian, who denies knowing Derek. Carl realises Ian took £10,000 from the box that Derek owed him, and Ian is terrified of Carl. The next day, Carl sees his ex-girlfriend, Kirsty Branning (Kierston Wareing), who says she is now married and pregnant, and he has no reason to stay. At the restaurant, Carl makes Ian confess to taking his money, and tells Ian to pay him £500 a week for the foreseeable future. He then tells Kirsty he is not leaving. Ian soon realises the situation between Carl and Kirsty, so he threatens to tell Kirsty about Carl's blackmail. Carl responds by burning Ian's hand.|$|E
25|$|It {{was opened}} at twelve o'clock on Mrs Thwaytes' 48th birthday, 2 October 1837. A large triumphal arch {{intertwined}} with greenery {{and topped with}} flags was built close to the Clock Tower. Mrs Thwaytes, accompanied by Simm Smith and wearing a blue satin crinoline, was conveyed along the very short distance from her residence to the Clock Tower {{in the first of}} a train of carriages containing trustees of the Clock Tower and other personages bearing wands and wearing blue rosettes. This procession was preceded by blue and white flags and a band, and followed by a cheering multitude. On arrival at the site, the multitude cheered again loudly and hats were thrown. It was noted that Mrs Thwaytes was slightly unwell, but she thanked the crowd. Simm Smith read out <b>her</b> <b>address</b> in which she presented the Clock Tower to the town. At {{the beginning and end of}} the ceremony a salute was fired from the four fog-warning cannon on the pier, and a free meal was provided for a hundred charity children, their parents, and the construction workers who built the Tower. Large numbers of gentlemen ate dinners and drank toasts at the Kent and Pier hotels. In the evening there was a firework display and a clock tower in variegated fire created by Mr Fewick who had been in charge of fireworks at the 1836 ceremony. Opening Day was also celebrated by villagers in Herne which was festooned with decorations following Mrs Thwaytes' distribution of money, food and goods. Celebrations on the anniversary of this opening ceremony and Mrs Thwaytes' birthday continued until at least 1839 when the gentry enjoyed a dinner, ball and concert.|$|E

500|$|The German {{campaign}} for a permanent seat was intensified in 2004. Schröder made himself perfectly clear in August 2004: [...] "Germany {{has the right to}} a seat."

Current German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had initially been quiet on the issue, re-stated Germany's bid in <b>her</b> <b>address</b> to the UN General Assembly in September 2007. In July 2011, Merkel's trip to Kenya, Angola, and Nigeria was thought to be motivated, in part, by the goal of seeking support from African countries for Germany's bid for a permanent seat on the Security Council.|$|E

[...] He hopes to take advantage of Maria and build an actual singing career, but is unable to find the aging diva again—he does not know <b>her</b> <b>address,</b> and the tenement buildings appear all the same to him.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1797 Hamilton became the first major American {{politician}} publicly involved in a sex scandal. Six years earlier, in {{the summer of}} 1791, 34-year-old Hamilton started an affair with 23-year-old Maria Reynolds. According to Hamilton's recount, Maria approached him at his house in Philadelphia, claiming that her husband, James Reynolds, had abandoned her and she wished to return to her relatives in New York but lacked the means. Hamilton retrieved <b>her</b> <b>address</b> and delivered her $30 personally at her boarding house where she led him into her bedroom and [...] "Some conversation ensued from which it was quickly apparent that other than pecuniary consolation would be acceptable".
