The U.S. government strongly encouraged the tribes to turn from hunting to farming, trading the woodlands for the plains.|$|E

5|$|A 1993 study {{proposed}} that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was {{not the result of}} hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage.

5|$|Japan began {{considering}} airline deregulation in {{the late}} 1970s, with the government announcing the abandoning of the 45/47 system in 1985. In 1987 Japan Airlines was completely privatised, {{and the other two}} airlines in Japan, All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Japan Air System (JAS), were permitted to compete with JAL on domestic and international routes. <b>Increased</b> <b>competition</b> resulted in changes to the airline's corporate structure, and it was reorganised into three divisions: international passenger service, domestic passenger service, and cargo (including mail) service.|$|E
5|$|Outsourcing {{is among}} some of the many reasons for <b>increased</b> <b>competition</b> within {{developing}} countries. Aside from being a reason for competition, many First World countries see outsourcing, in particular offshore outsourcing, as an opportunity for increased income.

It is because of competition (including outsourcing) that Robert Feenstra and Gordon Hanson predict {{that there will be a}} rise of 15â€“33 percent in inequality amongst these countries.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the years}} {{more than twenty}} steamships {{were a part of}} the fleet, {{including}} the 1112 ton Merimbula and the 693 ton Eden.

The company's eventual demise came {{as a result of a}} number of factors, including <b>increased</b> <b>competition</b> from road and rail, the cost of replacing ships after World War II, waterfront disputes and rising costs. As a consequence, after almost 100 years in operation, the company was placed into voluntary receivership and was delisted from the stock exchange in 1955.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the following unique {{characteristic of the}} piped water market: Consider two firms that supply different water qualities into the same net.

We show under the assumptions of our model that <b>increasing</b> <b>competition</b> decreases prices, lowers the water quality and increases welfare surplus. Nevertheless a decrease in the water quality does not imply that deregulation of the water market is impossible. Even if the water quality is held exogenously constant <b>increasing</b> <b>competition</b> leads to an increase in welfare. ...|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{economic}} activity, permanent {{settlement of the}} peninsula did not intensify until the 1860s and even then it remained sporadic until 1917. The population of Kola in 1880, for example, was only around 500inhabitants living in 80households, compared to 1,900inhabitants in 300households living there in 1582. Transportation facilities were virtually non-existent and the communication {{with the rest of}} Russia irregular. 1887 saw an influx of Izhma Komi and Nenets people who were migrating to the peninsula to escape a reindeer disease epidemic in their home lands and brought their large deer herds with them, resulting in <b>increased</b> <b>competition</b> for the grazing lands, a conflict between the Komi and the Sami, and in marginalization of the local Sami population. By the end of the 19th century, the Sami population had mostly been forced north, with ethnic Russians settling in the south of the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|From 1906 the CLR {{began to}} {{experience}} a large fall in passenger numbers caused by <b>increased</b> <b>competition</b> from the DR and the MR, which electrified the Inner Circle in 1905, and from the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP) which opened its rival route to Hammersmith in 1906. Road traffic also offered a greater challenge as motor buses began replacing the horse drawn variety in greater numbers. In an attempt to maintain income, the company increased the flat fare for longer journeys to three pence in July 1907 and reduced the fare for shorter journeys to one penny in March 1909. Multiple booklets of tickets, which had previously been sold at face value, were offered at discounts, and season tickets were introduced from July 1911.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 {{the company}} was {{incorporated}} as the Illawarra and South Coast Steam Navigation Company (ISCSNC), and the company continued to operate successfully until the Second World War. However, significant problems had emerged for the company, even though it remained in good financial standing. In particular, road transport was able to offer a door-to-door service, (although the company did attempt to provide something similar at Narooma), and the railways provided <b>increased</b> <b>competition,</b> entering into exclusive contracts with some hotels and taking some goods contracts away from the shipping line. When combined with waterfront disputes, rising costs, and the post-war costs of ship replacement, {{the company was}} in trouble, and in 1948, for the first time, no dividend was paid to investors. In 1950 the company entered into voluntary liquidation, and this led to delisting from the Australian Stock Exchange in 1955.|$|E

5|$|Post-war {{development}} was different in southern Indiana. The state's commerce along the Ohio River was reduced during the war, {{especially after the}} closure of the Mississippi River to commercial trade with the South and <b>increased</b> <b>competition</b> from the state's expanding railroad network. Some of Indiana's river towns, such as Evansville, recovered by providing transport to Union troops across the Ohio River, but others did not. Before the war, New Albany was the largest city in the state, primarily due to its commerce with the South, but its trade dwindled during the war. After the war much of Indiana viewed New Albany as too friendly to the South. New Albany's formerly robust steamboat-building industry ended in 1870; the last steamboat built in New Albany was named the Robert E. Lee. New Albany never regained its pre-war stature; its population leveled off at 40,000, and only the antebellum, early-Victorian Mansion Row district remains from its boom period.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} bus operators within Sheffield: First South Yorkshire, Stagecoach Yorkshire, TM Travel, Hulleys of Baslow, Powells, G Holmes and Sheffield Community Transport. First South Yorkshire, became {{by far the}} largest bus operator and in recent years implemented a series of fare rises and service cuts which saw bus ridership drop. Recent developments have seen Stagecoach Sheffield taking over Yorkshire Terrier, Andrews and parent company Yorkshire Traction, thus forming one company and in the process expanding their bus services in the city. This has resulted in <b>increased</b> <b>competition,</b> and price drops on certain routes. A zero-fare bus service, the FreeBee (Operated by First South Yorkshire), operated a circular route around the city centre from the Sheffield Interchange. The FreeBee buses stopped in 2014 and is due to save Â£8 million.|$|E
5|$|This tactic proved highly successful, with Sinclair announcing by March 1982 that it {{had sold}} 250,000 ZX81s worldwide. 50,000 {{computers}} were sold each month, 60% outside the UK, despite Sinclair and W.

It was cut by another Â£10 the following April. Despite the <b>increased</b> <b>competition</b> from much more capable computers, the ZX81 was still shipping in excess of 30,000 units a month even as late as July 1983, more than two years after it had been launched.
