5|$|According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center {{has long}} labored to legalize its monopolistic {{position}} of the Main expert institution of the country. The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center {{to get in touch}} over the telephone with the judges and <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> who is who and what is the guideline, although the judges themselves have already learned it—have {{turned out to be a}} considerable drop in the level of the expert reports on many positions. Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the expert reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented expert report, and to legalize the state of affairs. Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do nothing against the State experts.|$|E
5|$|An Australian naval vessel, HMAS Swan, {{under the}} command of Commander Arthur Bond (RN), {{conducted}} a reconnaissance and intelligence gathering mission in the Black Sea and territory of the Don Cossacks in December 1918, in conjunction with the French destroyer Bisson. The mission, conducted on behalf of the British military mission then advising the White Russian forces under General Denikin, was detailed to report to the true state of the Cossack forces and was carefully circumscribed by the British Foreign Office. Indeed, although the Cossacks fêted Commander Bond as a comrade-in-arms he had to <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> that they were purely on an information gathering mission with the Australian vessel in no way intended to render military or naval aid to the Cossacks. After inspecting anti-Bolshevik forces in the area, as well as numerous military facilities and factories, Swan subsequently carried out anti-Bolshevik guard duties in Sevastopol, with the ship's guns helped protect the railway station {{at the head of the}} Inkerman valley. These duties were completed without incident and Swan subsequently sailed for Plymouth on 3 January 1919.|$|E
25|$|During World War II and {{for many}} years afterward, Capp worked tirelessly going to {{hospitals}} to entertain patients, especially to cheer recent amputees and <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> {{that the loss of}} a limb did not mean an end to a happy and productive life. Making no secret of his own disability, Capp openly joked about his prosthetic leg his whole life. In 1946 Capp created a special full-color comic book, Al Capp by Li'l Abner, to be distributed by the Red Cross to encourage the thousands of amputee veterans returning from the war. Capp was also involved with the Sister Kenny Foundation, which pioneered new treatments for polio in the 1940s. Serving in his capacity as honorary chairman, Capp made public appearances on its behalf for years, contributed free artwork for its annual fund-raising appeals, and entertained crippled and paraplegic children in children's hospitals with inspirational pep talks, humorous stories and sketches.|$|E

25|$|The {{geographer}} Pausanias {{records that}} Athena placed the infant Erichthonius {{into a small}} chest (cista), which she entrusted {{to the care of}} the three daughters of Cecrops: Herse, Pandrosos, and Aglauros of Athens. She warned the three sisters not to open the chest, but did not <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> why or what was in it. Aglauros, and possibly one of the other sisters, opened the chest. Differing reports say that they either found that the child itself was a serpent, that it was guarded by a serpent, that it was guarded by two serpents, or that it had the legs of a serpent. In Pausanias's story, the two sisters were driven mad by the sight of the chest's contents and hurled themselves off the Acropolis, dying instantly, but an Attic vase painting shows them being chased by the serpent {{off the edge of the}} cliff instead. Erichthonius was one of the most important founding heroes of Athens and the legend of the daughters of Cecrops was a cult myth linked to the rituals of the Arrhephoria festival.|$|E

Ebert said, [...] "In 39 years, I have never written these {{words in a}} movie review, but here they are: You owe it to {{yourself}} to see this film. If you do not, and you have grandchildren, you should <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> why you decided not to," [...] calling the film [...] "horrifying, enthralling and [...] the potential, I believe, to actually change public policy and begin a process which could save the Earth." ...|$|E

Jeffrey began by expressing reservations: {{this is not a}} book of great learning and less a book of criticism than of appreciation. And yet, Jeffrey concedes, the [...] "appreciation" [...] is of the highest kind, and he is [...] "not [...] much inclined to disagree with" [...] Hazlitt [...] "after reading his eloquent exposition" [...] of the points he makes about Shakespeare. [...] "The book [...] is written less to tell the reader what Mr. H. knows about Shakespeare or his writings, than to <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> what he feels about them—and why he feels so—and thinks that all who profess to love poetry should feel so likewise." [...] While Characters does not [...] "show extraordinary knowledge of [...] production" [...] it nevertheless shows [...] "very considerable originality and genius." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, {{voters were}} asked about two amendments. One was the Victims' Rights Amendment, which {{required}} prosecutors {{to stay in touch}} with crime victims and their families, to <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> how purported offenses involving them were to be prosecuted, and to notify them when persons who had committed crimes against them were being scheduled for parole or release, among other provisions. The other amendment removed the word [...] "comfortable" [...] from the requirements for minimum standards for prisons. Both of these amendments passed by overwhelming margins in an election marked by a very light turnout. The amendments represented the first changes to the constitution in 20 years.|$|E

2500|$|In the Anguttara Nikaya, Maudgalyāyana {{is called}} {{foremost}} in psychic powers. In teaching, Maudgalyāyana relies much on such powers. Varying accounts in the Pali Canon show Maudgalyāyana travelling to and speaking with pretas (spirits in unhappy destinations) {{in order to}} <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> their horrific conditions. He helped them understand their own suffering, {{so they could be}} released from it or come to terms with it. He then reported about this to the Buddha, who used these examples in his teachings. Similarly, Maudgalyāyana is also depicted as conversing with devas and brahmas (heavenly beings), and asking devas what deeds they did to be reborn in heaven. In summary, Maudgalyāyana's meditative insights and psychic powers were not only to his own benefit, but benefited the public at large. In the words of historian Julie Gifford, he guided others [...] "by providing a cosmological and karmic map of samsara".|$|E
2500|$|The {{slaughter}} of the headquarters guard corps shocked and angered the other Tianxiong troops, despite Luo's attempt to <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> the reasons. [...] A {{group of soldiers}} supported the officer Shi Renyu (史仁遇), who took over Gaotang (高唐, in modern Liaocheng, Shandong) and claimed the title of acting military governor. [...] He sought aid from Hedong and Yichang. [...] However, he was quickly defeated and killed by Zhu's officers Li Zhouyi (李周彝) and Fu Daozhao (符道昭), before those circuits could aid him. [...] Still, even with Zhu's aid, it took Luo half a year to quell all of the mutinies. [...] During that period, with the Xuanwu army present and Luo forced to supply it well, the Tianxiong supplies were exhausted. [...] It was aid that {{the destruction of the}} headquarters guard corps ended much of the threat against Luo's rule, but the fighting abilities of the Tianxiong army was thereafter permanently damaged. [...] Luo, in regret, stated, [...] "Even with all the iron from the six prefectures and 43 counties of this circuit, I could not have forged a greater error." ...|$|E
2500|$|During their negotiations, {{both sides}} {{agreed that the}} opening act from the inaugural show until their {{scheduled}} performance on April 4 in Philadelphia would be Manson's option, stoner rock band Monster Magnet. A dispute arose on who would take over. According to Erlandson and Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur, the two groups had a two-hour meeting {{to arrive at a}} resolution. Manson and his band voted for early 1980s Brit-pop groups like Fun Boy Three and Fine Young Cannibals, while members of Hole wanted [...] "more modern" [...] bands. Auf der Maur noted that [...] "we want romance and they want theater. We want love and they want shtick. We had to <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> that those kinds of bands make them look good, but us look silly". Eventually, Manson's band ceded the selection of the subsequent opening act to Love, who chose Imperial Teen. During their negotiations, both bands agreed to split the cost of producing each show, which resulted in Hole unwittingly financing most of Manson's disproportionately higher production costs at their own expense. The revenue earned at each show would be split 50/50 between the two bands.|$|E
