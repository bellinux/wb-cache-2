Methods. Plasma samples () from Swedish blood donors that had been genotyped for secretor (FUT 2) np 105 and Lewis (Le; FUT 3) genotypes and phenotyped for ABO and Le blood groups were analyzed for immunoglobulin G antibody prevalence and titers to norovirus genogroup (GG) II. 4.

40|$|We have {{proposed}} that significant subsets of individuals with IgA deficiency (IgA-D) and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) may represent polar ends of a clinical spectrum reflecting a single underlying genetic defect. This proposal was supported by our finding that individuals with these immunodeficiencies have in common {{a high incidence of}} C 4 A gene deletions and C 2 rare gene alleles. Here we present our analysis of the MHC haplotypes of 12 IgA-D and 19 CVID individuals from 21 families and of 79 of their immediate relatives. MHC haplotypes were defined by analyzing polymorphic markers for 11 genes or their products between the HLA-DQB 1 and the HLA-A genes. Five of the families investigated contained more than one <b>immunodeficient</b> <b>individual</b> and all of these included both IgA-D and CVID members. Analysis of the data indicated that a small number of MHC haplotypes were shared by the majority of immunodeficient individuals. At least one of two of these haplotypes was present in 24 of the 31 (77 %) immunodeficient individuals. No differences in the distribution of these haplotypes were observed between IgA-D and CVID individuals. Detailed analysis of these haplotypes suggests that a susceptibility gene or genes for both immunodeficiencies are located within the class III region of the MHC, possibly between the C 4 B and C 2 genes...|$|E

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the highly active {{antiretroviral}} therapy (HAART), the natural course of HIV infection has markedly changed and opportunistic infections including toxoplasmosis have declined and modified in presentation, outcome and incidence. However, TE is a major cause of morbidity and mortality especially in resource-poor settings but also a common neurological complication in some countries despite the availability of HAART and effective prophylaxis. In most cases toxoplasmosis occurs in brain and toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) is the most common presentation of toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients with or without AIDS. The need of a definitive diagnosis is substantial because other brain diseases could share similar findings. Rapid and specific diagnosis is thus crucial as early treatment may improve the clinical outcome. Classical serological diagnosis is often inconclusive as <b>immunodeficient</b> <b>individuals</b> fail to produce significant titres of specific antibodies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has a high diagnostic value in the acute disease, but like many 'in-house' PCR assays, suffers from lack of standardization and variable performance according to the laboratory.

Inflammatory responses {{play an important role}} in the fatal outcome of IAV infection, but the mechanism remains unclear. We demonstrate here that the absence of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells in mice during IAV infection resulted in the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which suppressed IAV-specific immune responses through the expression of both arginase and NOS, resulting in high IAV titer and increased mortality. Adoptive transfer of iNKT cells abolished the suppressive activity of MDSCs, restored IAV-specific immune responses, reduced IAV titer, and increased survival rate. The crosstalk between iNKT and MDSCs was CD 1 d- and CD 40 -dependent. Furthermore, IAV infection and exposure to TLR agonists relieved the suppressive activity of MDSCs. Finally, we extended these results to humans by demonstrating the presence of myeloid cells with suppressive activity in the PBLs of individuals infected with IAV and showed that their suppressive activity is substantially reduced by iNKT cell activation. These findings identify what we believe to be a novel immunomodulatory role of iNKT cells, which we suggest could be harnessed to abolish the immunosuppressive activity of MDSCs during IAV infection...|$|R

40|$|Rapid and {{sensitive}} tools for {{the diagnosis of}} tuberculosis are needed, due to the increased incidence of tuberculosis epidemics {{and the length of}} time required by classical diagnostic tests, especially among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected patients. In this context, the recent advances in cloning and characterization of M, tuberculosis genes has allowed the application of basic molecular biology techniques to the examination of clinical samples, such as sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), for the molecular diagnosis of tuberculous infection, By using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the amplification of mycobacterial nucleic acids and nonradiometric revelation techniques, the time required for the identification of mycobacteria has been considerably shortened (24 - 48 h), in comparison to the time required by microbiological tests, When PCR technique is performed by experienced laboratory personnel using controlled protocols, false-negative (caused primarily by endogenous polymerase inhibitors) and false-positive results (due to contamination) can generally be avoided, achieving sensitivity and specificity close to 100 %. In the clinical practice, the use of molecular testing for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, in combination with ''classic'' diagnostic tools, can greatly enhance the diagnostic ability of pulmonary clinicians, particularly in paucibacillary infections and in patients with atypical presentation, such as <b>immunodeficient</b> <b>individuals...</b>|$|R
