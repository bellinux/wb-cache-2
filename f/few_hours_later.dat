It made a third and final {{landfall}} on July 15 when it moved inland over British Honduras (presently known as Belize) as a minimal hurricane. Abby quickly weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm only a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later</b> over land. While Abby approached the border of Guatemala and Mexico, it had weakened further to a tropical depression. Abby dissipated while situated over the Mexican state of Tabasco on July 16. The remnants crossed over Mexico into the Pacific Ocean and regenerated into Hurricane Celeste on July 20. Hurricane Celeste lasted for two days in the Pacific before it dissipated on July 22.|$|E

5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression tracked towards the west-northwest {{due to a}} strong subtropical ridge located {{to the north of}} the system. A <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the system made landfall in Dilasag, Philippines with winds of 55km/h (35mph 1-minute winds). After being over land for most of July31, the depression relocated into the South China Sea and the JTWC determined that it intensified into a tropical storm. At around 06:00 UTC, the JMA designated the storm Tropical Storm Prapiroon about 300km (185mi) northwest of Dagupan City, Philippines, a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> PAGASA issued their final advisory on Tropical Storm Henry (Prapiroon) as it moved out of their area of responsibility. Prapiroon gradually intensified as it moved towards the west-northwest at 24km/h (15mph), and by that afternoon, the system had completely moved into the South China Sea. By the nighttime hours, the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a severe tropical storm, as they determined that the maximum sustained winds had reached 95km/h (60mph 10-minute winds). By the morning of August2, the JTWC upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon, and a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later,</b> the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon.|$|E
5|$|Following Greg's formation, a {{tropical}} storm warning was issued for the coast of Mexico from Manzanillo, Colima to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, including Islas Marías. The warning was extended to include Lázaro Cárdenas a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later.</b> On September6, {{a tropical}} storm warning was issued for locations south of La Paz {{on the east coast}} of Baja California, while {{a tropical storm}} watch was hoisted for areas south of Punta Abreojos on the west coast. A tropical storm warning was then issued for the west coast of Baja California south of Cabo San Lázaro. As Greg intensified, a hurricane warning was raised from Arroyo Seco southward, and for the east coast of Baja California from La Paz southward. A tropical storm watch was raised from north of La Paz to Loreto. Late on September7, the hurricane warning was reduced to a tropical storm warning as Greg weakened. The watches and warnings were lifted from the east coast of Baja California early on September8, and they were subsequently lifted for all areas a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>later.</b>|$|E

Tbe minimum dose of highly purified bovine diabetogenic peptide which is capable of maintaining muscle glycogen at normal levels was found to be 0. 2 - 0. 3 mg. in I 35 - 150 -g. rats. 4. Diabetogenic peptide maintains muscle glycogen in fasted hypophysectomized-adrenalectomized rats. 5. Diabetogenic peptide does not promote growth as measured by the tibia test. IN recent work from this laboratory (Louis, Conn, and Minick, 1963; Louis and Conn, 1969) isolation of an insulin antagonist from the urine of patients with lipoatrophic diabetes and from diabetic patients with proteinuria has beeri reported. It was also demonstrated that a similar substance can be isolated from bovine, ovine, and porcine adenohypophyses (Louis, Conn, and Minick, 1966; Louis and Conn, 1968). The sub-stance is a polypeptide. When administered either to dog or man it induces resistance to exogenous insulin and reduces tolerance for glucose. The present report describes a glycostatic effect of this peptide, similar in nature to that exerted by growth hormone. When food is withheld from hypophysec-tomized rats, the carbohydrate stores of the body are quickly depleted.

Three techniques were used: unscheduled DNA synthesis, photolysis of DNA repaired {{in the presence}} of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd), and measurements of sites sensitive to a UV-endonuclease. The repair rate appears to be approximately constant during the first <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> after treatment. <b>Later</b> there is a decrease with time; the magnitude of the decrease depends on the cell line. Our data show that the decrease in repair observed in repair-deficient cells treated with combinations of both agents as compared to separate treatments is due neither to the cytotoxic effects of the agents used, nor to a shutoff of the repair system by the high concentrations of AAAF employed...|$|R
