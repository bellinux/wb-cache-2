40|$|Many fishways <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>built</b> at {{the dams}} of Japan 2 ̆ 7 s rivers. Effective fishways {{for the fish}} which swim up them must have entrances {{situated}} close to the dam 2 ̆ 7 s food supply. The velocities of the fishway channels must be slower than the maximum speed of the fish which swim up the channels. Under such conditions, the fishways <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>built.</b> Fishways with pool-type channels <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>built</b> at the dams of the Agano River and the Matsuura River. Fishways with deep, baffled channels <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>built</b> at dams of the Kitakami River, the Abukuma River and the Hazama River. A fishway <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>built</b> at the dam site of the Yoshida River...|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{histories of}} British and Irish castles were recorded, albeit {{in a somewhat}} fragmented fashion, by John Leland in the 16th century and, by the 19th century, historical analysis of castles had become popular. Victorian historians such as George Clark and John Parker concluded that British castles <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>built</b> {{for the purposes of}} military defence, but believed that their history was pre-Conquest – concluding that the mottes across the countryside <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>built</b> by either the Romans or Celts.|$|E

5|$|Scarborough's first schoolhouse {{opened in}} 1805 on the Thomson farmstead. In 1847 Egerton Ryerson {{recommended}} that 11 school districts be created.

5|$|Stone keep {{construction}} required skilled craftsmen. Unlike {{timber and}} earthworks, {{which could be}} built using unfree labour or serfs, these craftsmen had to be paid and stone keeps were therefore expensive. They were also relatively slow to erect, due to {{the limitations of the}} lime mortar used during the period – a keep's walls could usually be raised by a maximum of only 12 feet (3.6 metres) a year; the keep at Scarborough was not atypical in taking ten years to build. The number of such keeps remained relatively low: in England, for example, although several early stone keeps <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>built</b> after the conquest, there were only somewhere between ten and fifteen in existence by 1100, and only around a hundred <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>built</b> by 1216.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{production}} target was 100 cars per month. By {{the end of}} 1922, after slightly {{more than a year}} of production, fewer than 150 Duesenberg Straight Eights <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>built.</b> Production of the Straight Eight continued through several changes in management, placement of the Duesenberg Automobiles and Motors Company into receivership in January 1924, and the restructuring of the company into the Duesenberg Motor Company in February 1925, until the purchase of the company by E. L. Cord in October 1926. About 650 Straight Eights <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>built</b> when Cord ended production in 1926.|$|E
5|$|The new Mk. XII bombsight {{was first}} tested in September and October 1940 {{and by the}} end of October, 20 {{examples}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>built.</b> A slightly improved version, the Mk. XIII was designed but not put into production.|$|E

5|$|To let {{the river}} {{replenish}} itself, {{most of the}} dams that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>built</b> were removed in 1893. Ten years later it had somewhat recovered, and people were again using it for drinking water and swimming.|$|E

5|$|A lack of {{preparation}} for the disaster contributed to the high death toll. Armero <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>built</b> on an alluvial fan that had been overrun by historic mudflows; authorities had ignored a hazard-zone map that showed the potential damage to the town from lahars. Residents stayed inside their dwellings to avoid the falling ash, as local officials had instructed them to do, not thinking {{that they might be}} buried by the mudflows.|$|E
50|$|Most recently, {{detached}} houses <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>built</b> at The Spires and Pikes Bridge Fold, and flats <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>built</b> on Holme Road.

5|$|After {{their success}} {{in the first month}} of the war, mass {{production}} was ordered and the development of other models proceeded. The Katyusha was inexpensive and could be manufactured in light industrial installations which did not have the heavy equipment to build conventional artillery gun barrels. By the end of 1942, 3,237 Katyusha launchers of all types <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>built,</b> {{and by the end of}} the war total production reached about 10,000.|$|E
5|$|Although the Richard III Society {{remained}} {{interested in}} discussing the possible location of the king's grave, they did not search for his remains. Individual members suggested possible lines of investigation, but neither the University of Leicester nor local historians and archaeologists took up the challenge, probably because it was widely thought that the grave site <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>built</b> over or the skeleton had been scattered, as John Speed's account suggested.|$|E
5|$|As {{construction}} began, Tenrikyo followers {{founded the}} Oyasato Construction Young Men's Association Hinokishin Corps, which volunteered time and labor {{to help build}} the yakata. The corps still continues their work today. By 1956, {{one corner of the}} complex <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>built</b> at the cost of 23billion yen, an enormous expense given the economic depression of the time.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 13th century a large prison <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>built</b> in the castle; {{this was}} {{probably}} constructed in the north-west corner of the Lower Court, overlooked by the Prison Tower.

5|$|Chadderton's {{urbanisation}} {{and expansion}} largely coincided with developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian era. A late 19th century factory-building boom transformed Chadderton from a rural township {{into a major}} mill town—one of several in its region—and the second most populous urban district in the United Kingdom. More than 50cotton mills <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>built</b> in Chadderton by 1914.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{teething}} {{problems with the}} Ju 87, the RLM ordered 216 Ju 87 A-1s into production and wanted to receive delivery of all machines between January 1936 and 1938. The Junkers production capacity was fully occupied and licensing to other production facilities became necessary. The first 35 Ju 87 A-1s were therefore produced by the Weser Flugzeugbau (WFG). By 1 September 1939, 360 Ju 87 As and Bs <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>built</b> by the Junkers factories at Dessau and Weserflug factory in Lemwerder near Bremen. By 30 September 1939, Junkers had received 2,365,196 Reichsmark (RM) for Ju 87 construction orders. The RLM paid another 243,646 RM for development orders. According to audit records in Berlin, {{by the end of}} the financial year on 30 September 1941, 3,059,000 RM had been spent on Ju 87 airframes. By 30 June 1940, 697 Ju 87 B-1s and 129 B-2s alone had been produced. Another 105 R-1s and seven R-2s <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>built.</b>|$|E
