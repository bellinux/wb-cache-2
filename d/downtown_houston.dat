5|$|The {{historical}} {{range of}} the bobcat was from southern Canada, throughout the United States, and {{as far south as}} the Mexican state of Oaxaca, and it still persists across much of this area. In the 20th century, it was thought to have lost territory in the US Midwest and parts of the Northeast, including southern Minnesota, eastern South Dakota, and much of Missouri, mostly due to habitat changes from modern agricultural practices. While thought to no longer exist in western New York and Pennsylvania, multiple confirmed sightings of bobcats (including dead specimens) have been recently reported in New York's Southern Tier and in central New York. In addition, bobcat sightings have been confirmed in northern Indiana, and one was recently killed near Albion, Michigan. In early March, 2010, a bobcat was sighted (and later captured by animal control authorities) in a parking garage in <b>downtown</b> <b>Houston.</b> By 2010, bobcats appear to have recolonized many states, occurring in every state except Delaware.|$|E
25|$|The {{onset of}} the 1980s oil glut had devastating {{economic}} consequences for Downtown. In the mid-1980s, a bank {{savings and loan crisis}} forced many tenants in <b>Downtown</b> <b>Houston</b> buildings to retrench, and some went out of business. This development further caused <b>Downtown</b> <b>Houston</b> to decline. In 1986, Downtown's Class A office occupancy rate was 81.4%. The <b>Downtown</b> <b>Houston</b> business occupancy rate of all office space increased from 75.8% at the end of 1987 to 77.2% at the end of 1988.
