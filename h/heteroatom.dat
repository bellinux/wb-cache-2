5|$|The {{reaction}} {{mechanism for the}} Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction consists of nucleophilic addition of the ylide to the carbonyl or imine group. A negative charge is transferred to the <b>heteroatom</b> and because the sulfonium cation is a good leaving group it gets expelled forming the ring. In the related Wittig reaction, {{the formation of the}} much stronger phosphorus-oxygen double bond prevents oxirane formation and instead, olefination takes place through a 4-membered cyclic intermediate.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{cyclization}} has occurred, an oxyallyl cation is formed. As discussed extensively above, {{the typical}} course for this intermediate is elimination followed by enolate tautomerization. However, these two steps can be interrupted by various nucleophiles and electrophiles, respectively. Oxyallyl cation trapping {{has been developed}} extensively by Fredrick G. West of the University of Alberta and his review covers the field. The oxyallyl cation can be trapped with <b>heteroatom</b> and carbon nucleophiles and can also undergo cationic cycloadditions with various tethered partners. Shown below is a cascade reaction in which successive cation trapping generates a pentacyclic core in one step with complete diastereoselectivity.|$|E

25|$|It is {{considerably}} more reactive than benzene in electrophilic substitution reactions, {{due to the}} electron-donating effects of the oxygen <b>heteroatom.</b> Examination of the resonance contributors shows the increased electron density of the ring, leading to increased rates of electrophilic substitution.|$|E

25|$|When {{both the}} Lewis acidity of the organolithium {{compound}} and the Lewis basicity of the substituent are high, as in lithiations of ortho-(dialkylamino)methyl toluenes with n-butyllithium in a non-coordinating solvent, coordination {{of the base}} to the <b>heteroatom</b> substituent takes place.

25|$|Pyrrole is a colorless {{volatile}} liquid that darkens readily upon {{exposure to}} air, {{and is usually}} purified by distillation immediately before use. Pyrrole has a nutty odor.

In CDCl3, it has chemical shifts at 6.68 (H2, H5) and 6.22 (H3, H4). Pyrrole is weakly basic, with a conjugate acid pKa of −3.8. The most thermodynamically stable pyrrolium cation (C4H6N+) is formed by protonation at the 2 position. Substitution of pyrrole with alkyl substituents provides a more basic molecule—for example, tetramethylpyrrole has a conjugate acid pKa of +3.7. Pyrrole is also weakly acidic at the N–H position, with a pKa of 17.5.|$|E

500|$|Sigmatropic rearrangements are {{concisely}} {{described by}} an order term , which {{is defined as}} the [...] of a σ-bond adjacent to one or more π systems to a new position (i−1) and (j−1) atoms removed from the original location of the σ-bond. When the sum of i and j is an even number, this is an indication of the involvement of a neutral, all C atom chain.

2500|$|Toluene {{derivatives}} with heteroatom-containing substituents in the ortho position undergo site-selective benzylic lithiation in {{the presence}} of organolithium compounds (either alkyllithiums or lithium dialkylamides). Coordination of the Lewis acidic lithium atom to the Lewis basic <b>heteroatom,</b> as well as inductive effects derived from the electronegativity of the <b>heteroatom,</b> encourage selective deprotonation at the benzylic position. Competitive ring metalation (directed ortho-metalation) is an important side reaction, but a judicious choice of base often allows for selective benzylic metalation. Useful heteroatom-containing directing groups include dialkylamines, amides (secondary or tertiary), ketone enolates, carbamates, and sulfonates. Lateral lithiation of alkyl-substituted heterocycles incorporating heteroatom-containing substituents is also possible, although ring lithiation α to the ring <b>heteroatom</b> may compete with lateral lithiation. The products of lateral lithiation react with a variety of electrophiles, including reactive alkyl halides (allylic, benzylic, and primary), carbonyl compounds, silyl and stannyl chlorides, disulfides and diselenides, and others. A general, highly selective method for benzylic metalation using a mixed lithium and potassium metal amide (LiNK chemistry) has been developed which permits metalation regardless of the relative position (ortho, meta or para) of the methyl group to the <b>heteroatom</b> containing substituent ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{intercalation}} of <b>heteroatoms</b> between graphene and a metal substrate {{has been}} studied intensively {{over the past few}} years, due to its effect on the graphene properties, and as a method to create vertical heterostructures. Various intercalation processes have been reported with different combinations of <b>heteroatoms</b> and substrates. Here we study Si intercalation between graphene and Ru(0001). We elucidate the role of cooperative interactions between hetero-atoms, graphene, and substrate. By combining scanning tunneling microscopy with density functional theory, the intercalation process is confirmed to consist of four key steps, involving creation of defects, migration of <b>heteroatoms,</b> self-repairing of graphene, and growth of an intercalated monolayer. Both theory and experiments indicate that this mechanism applies also to other combinations of hetero-atoms and substrates. Graphene, a two-dimensional crystal of carbon atoms packed i...|$|R
