In 1942, the United States [...] War Production Board issued Regulation L-85, cutting the use of natural fibers in clothing and mandating a 10% reduction {{in the amount of}} fabric in women's beachwear.

Britten asks how tall he was; outside, Bird asks for an {{explanation}} and Britten tries to spin a story about a small window at the clinic that someone could have crawled through to poison MacKenzie.

60|$|The {{greater part}} of the crowd on board--and, of course, the boat was crowded--looked {{as if they might}} not only be easily but safely known. There was little style and no {{distinction}} among them; they were people who were <b>going</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> for <b>the</b> fun or the relief of it, and were able to afford it. In face they were commonplace, with nothing but the American poetry of vivid purpose to light them up, where they did not wholly lack fire. But they were nearly all shrewd and friendly-looking, with an apparent readiness for the humorous intimacy native <b>to</b> us all. <b>The</b> women were dandified in dress, according to their means and taste, and the men differed from each other in degrees of indifference to it. To a straw-hatted population, such as ours is in summer, no sort of personal dignity is possible. We have not even the power over observers which comes from the fantasticality of an Englishman when he discards the conventional dress. In our straw hats and our serge or flannel sacks we are no more imposing than a crowd of boys.|$|R

60|$|Nothing else ever {{interested}} her so much, {{except what}} {{one of the girls}} in the box-factory had told her about <b>going</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> summers, and waiting on table.

They got nearly as much as they did in the box-factory; and then the boarders all gave you something extra; some of them gave as much as a dollar a week apiece. The head-waiter was a college student, and a perfect gentleman; he was always dressed up in a dress-suit and a white silk neck-tie. Statira said that next summer she wanted they should go off somewhere, she and 'Manda Grier, and wait on table together; and she knew Lemuel could easily get the head-waiter's place, after the St. Albans. She should not want he should be clerk, because then they could not have such good times, for they would be more separated.|$|R

Referring to her boyfriend she yells “That jerk Tatsukichi has voicemail on his phone again! He’s telling me he’s busy with his work…! But I wonder if he’s cheating on me or something?! ” Her sister, Sayo, suddenly appears. “Hm … you two really don’t connect do you. ” “Hey! What are you doing here Sayo! ” “This is a dangerous sign.

5000|$|At that time, the Jewish {{community}} in Toronto was predominantly poor and working-class. They {{were also the}} subject of discrimination, and were excluded from summer resorts outside of the city. Jewish families and youths in particular would therefore cool off during the hot summer months by staying in town and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> predominantly Anglo <b>Beaches</b> area in order to swim. This resulted in complaints and resentment from some local residents. Some of the locals formed [...] "Swastika Clubs", which openly displayed <b>the</b> Nazi symbol <b>to</b> express their displeasure and make Jews feel unwanted. The leaders of the Swastika Club initially insisted that the swastika {{had nothing to do}} with Hitler. They said they merely wanted <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> <b>Beach</b> clean. After a meeting with Jewish leaders backed by City officials, the Swastika club agreed to drop its symbol and its name. At that point, several of the members joined the Swastika Association of Canada that was much more open about its links to Hitler.|$|R
