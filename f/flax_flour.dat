Functional breads constitute an interesting alternative as vehicle of new essential fatty acids sources. The {{aim of this study}} was to improve the fatty acids (FA) profile of bakery products, producing breads with low saturated fatty acid (SFA) content and with high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content, through partial substitution of wheat flour by other ingredients (soy flour, <b>flax</b> <b>flour,</b> and wheat bran) and to analyze the effect of this change on the technological, rheological, and sensorial characteristics of breads...|$|E

Flaxseed flour (FF), soybeans flour (SF), or wheat bran (WB) was used to replace 50, 100, and 150 [*]g[*]kg− 1 of wheat flour (WF) in breads. FF or SF produced a decrease in monounsaturated and SFA and an increase of PUFA in these breads. Furthermore, breads replaced with FF presented considerable increase in the content of n 3 FA, while, SF or WB contributed to rise of linoleic and oleic FA, respectively. The substitution percentage increase of FF, SF, or WB to formulation produced changes in the colour, rheological, textural, and technological characteristics of breads. This replacement resulted in improved lipid profile, being breads with 50 [*]g[*]kg− 1 SF, the better acceptance, baking features, and enhanced fatty acid profile...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{production}} of gluten-free foods that are necessary for people suffering from this disease as celiac disease. The article reveals the relevance of developing recipes for gluten-free foods, which are not inferior to traditional in many respects. Classic recipes gluten-free bakery products, mainly based on rice, buckwheat, corn flour, which have little nutritional value. In this regard, the current development of technologies and formulations pastry dishes with use of nonconventional vegetable raw materials rich in dietary fibers, proteins and other beneficial substances that improve the biological and nutritional value of these products. The paper describes the formulation of gluten-free muffins, was based on the recipe of the cake "Capital". The main raw material for the new compositions of selected rice flour, and as enriching additives – <b>flax</b> <b>flour</b> and flour from the eggshell. Was conducted baking tests on the basis of which was chosen percentage of the input substances and the assessment of quality of semifinished and finished products. The quality of semi-finished products was evaluated by such indicators as humidity and the microstructure of the test. The quality of finished products was assessed using organoleptic and physical-chemical parameters, the results presented in the tables. Investigated the antioxidant activity of products. Produced sensometrical evaluation of aroma of control and experimental samples. Calculated chemical composition. The content of protein, vitamins, mineral substances in the experimental sample is significantly increased compared to control. Making flour egg shell has achieved the ratio of Ca-Mg-P as close to a perfect 1 : 0, 39 : 1, 53 Replacement of wheat flour with flaxseed and rice flour and the introduction of egg shell improve the amino acid composition of the product.

40|$|AbstractInfrared {{spectroscopy}} {{was used}} for multivariate determination of linoleic (LA) and linolenic (ALA) acids in yellow and brown flax seed samples, using partial least square regression (PLSR). The models were developed by correlating near-(NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopic signals with the acid content determined by GC-FID. For the flax seed samples, the best models for both, LA (R 2 = 0. 90, Standard Error of Prediction (SEP) = 1. 61) and ALA (R 2 = 0. 86, SEP= 0. 63) were obtained by processing the NIR spectral data. For samples of <b>flax</b> seed <b>flours,</b> the best models for prediction of the ALA (R 2 = 0. 99, SEP= 1. 21) and LA content (R 2 = 0. 88, SEP= 0. 76) were developed by processing the NIR and MIR spectral region, respectively. This report demonstrates that NIR and MIR spectroscopies are efficient techniques for the determination and quantification of LA and ALA in flax seed and <b>flax</b> seed <b>flours...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objetivou-se neste trabalho determinar a condição de extrusão mais adequada para produção de uma farinha pré-gelatinizada de arroz e linhaça desengordurada (80 : 20) para formulação de macarrão sem glúten. Foi elaborado um delineamento de misturas com diferentes mesclas de farinha pré-gelatinizada de arroz e linhaça, farinha de arroz e farinha de linhaça desengordurada e as características de cozimento (tempo ótimo de cozimento, aumento de massa, perda de sólidos) e perfil de textura (firmeza e pegajosidade) foram analisadas por meio de diagramas triangulares de mistura. Observou-se que a adição de 20 g de farinha de linhaça em 80 g de farinha de arroz elevou (p> 0, 05) os valores de cinzas, proteínas, lipídios, fibra alimentar total, solúvel e insolúvel e diminuiu o valor energético total e de carboidratos em relação à farinha de arroz. Ocorreu aumento do índice de solubilidade e absorção de água e capacidade de absorção de óleo após extrusão. Os maiores valores de índice de solubilidade [21, 36 g (100 g) - 1] e absorção de água [10, 23 g de gel (g de matéria seca) - 1]e menores de capacidade de absorção em óleo [2, 18 g de gel (g de matéria seca) - 1] foram encontrados nas maiores umidades e menores temperaturas de extrusão estudadas. Os parâmetros de cor também foram afetados pelas condições do processo, tornando as farinhas mais escuras (diminuição de L*), com maior tendência para os tons de vermelho e amarelo (aumento de a* e b*). As farinhas de arroz, de linhaça e mista de arroz e linhaça cruas diferiram entre si (p 0. 05) {{values of}} ash, proteins, lipids, total dietary fiber, soluble and {{insoluble}} and decreased total energy and carbohydrate {{in relation to}} rice flour. There {{was an increase in}} solubility index and water absorption and oil absorption capacity after extrusion. The highest values of solubility index [21. 36 g (100 g) - 1] and water absorption [10. 23 g of gel (g dry mass) - 1] and lower oil absorption capacity [2. 18 g of gel (g dry mass) - 1] were found in higher humidity and lower extrusion temperatures studied. The color parameters were also affected by process conditions, making the darker flour (decrease of L *), with a tendency to various shades of red and yellow (increased a * and b *). The rice <b>flour,</b> <b>flax</b> and mixed rice and raw linseed differed (p < 0. 05) compared to the pasta characteristics. The addition of flaxseed meal decreased the peak viscosity, final viscosity and the tendency to retrogradation of rice – flaxseed blend compared with rice flour. The pre-gelatinized flours showed an increase in viscosity at cold and viscosity breakdown, while there was a decrease in peak viscosity, final viscosity and tendency to retrograde compared to rice – flaxseed blend, rice and flaxseed flour, indicating that the process extrusion affects the characteristics of the pre-gelatinized flour. The ideal condition for the production of pre-gelatinized flour for pasta production is at a temperature of 111. 3 ° C and humidity in 18. 8 g (100 g) - 1. All experimental formulations of pasta are within the limits of quality for mass increase and loss of solids. Quality parameters of cooking, it was observed that the pasta is more desirable one with intermediate levels of pre-gelatinized flour [43 g (100 g) - 1], rice [47 g (100 g) - 1], and linseed [10 g (100 g) - 1], which may be characterized as food source of fiber. The results show the possibility of using rice-flaxseed blend, making this product a good quality food, the nutritional point of view, the protein value and the incorporation of dietary fiber. The changes in pre-gelatinized flour indicate that the extrusion process can be used in mixtures of rice and flaxseed in order to make feasible its use in the food industry by providing functional changes that are interesting from a technological standpoint...|$|R
