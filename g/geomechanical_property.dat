30|$|Well {{coverage}} {{in the study area}} is not adequate as revealed in Fig.  4 c. The wells are mostly clustered in the central and north-eastern part. Furthermore, in the study area conventional cores were collected in only five wells out of 27 wells made available. Thus, physical measurement and interpolation of geomechanical properties of these core samples were not considered as reliable source of information for future drilling and investment decision. Additionally, due to non-availability of 3 D seismic data, interpolation of well-based geomechanical properties beyond well control could not be validated through seismic attribute correlation and integration as secondary input. As a result, attempts to use the conventional approach of using well core sample analysis-based <b>geomechanical</b> <b>property</b> interpolation in the study area provided inappropriate information for full field appraisal and development planning. However, use of current geostatistics-based modeling approach explained in this study helped to nullify these restrictions and provided a full field <b>geomechanical</b> <b>property</b> distribution model with the integration of parameters from basin modeling approach. Such integrated models are highly flexible and appropriate for full field development with reliable distribution of <b>geomechanical</b> <b>property</b> in 3 D space of unconventional reservoir.|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic {{stimulation}} of low permeability rocks in unconventional reservoirs {{has been observed}} to trigger microearthquakes (MEQs). Triggering of the MEQ events {{has been linked to}} the pore pressure, temperature, and in-situ stress variations which result in crack initiation. The resulting clouds of micro-seismic events are believed to carry information about the underlying coupled flow, geomechanics, and thermal processes and hence rock hydraulic and <b>geomechanical</b> <b>property</b> distributions. We develop a probabilistic framework called stochastic seismicity-based reservoir characterization (SSBRC) to integrate microseismic events to infer reservoir property distributions. To model the geothermal reservoir stimulation, a fully coupled thermo-poroelastic finite element method (FEM) model has been developed to handle the coupled process of heat transport, fluid flow, and rock deformation. To simulate the stimulation process, an alternate simplistic approach is also acquired based on a major hypothesis that MEQ events are triggered by an increase in pore pressure. Based on this hypothesis, the distribution of the resulting microseismicity clouds can be viewed as monitoring data that carry important information about the spatial distribution of rock permeability. We apply the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to integrate the resulting continuous seismicity map to estimate hydraulic and <b>geomechanical</b> <b>property</b> distributions. We demonstrate that the standard application of the EnKF with such large correlated datasets can result in substantial loss of ensemble spread. We investigate three alternative implementation methods to mitigate this issue. We first present the methodology proposed for MEQ data integration with the EnKF, followed by a number of examples of applying SSBRC to both forward modeling methods to illustrate the uncertainty underestimation effect when the standard EnKF is applied to large-scale seismicity density map data. We then discuss the proposed methods for improving the uncertainty quantification results and illustrate the effectiveness of these methods by applying them to a number of numerical examples. We also apply and extend the proposed microseismic data integration method to unconventional reservoir with horizontal well and multistage hydraulic fractures to characterize the reservoir and induced fractures. We also investigate the effect of variogram model uncertainty in the EnKF performance and propose a modified EnKF algorithm to handle the uncertainty in variogram parameters. We also develop a computationally efficient data assimilation procedure by employing a pseudo forecast method and geological model clustering method along with EnKF. By a set of numerical experiments, we show how the proposed fast history matching method is successful in preserving the ensemble spread and expediting the integration procedure...|$|E
30|$|In mature field {{appraisal}} and development, discretized <b>geomechanical</b> <b>property</b> models play a {{vital role}} in providing information on in situ stress regime as a guide for placement of directional wells. Laboratory methods of measuring these properties, in most cases, take only small samples from consolidated rocks. These isolated samples may not be representative of the entire elastic regime existing in the reservoir owing to sample size. In general, geomechanical studies are performed on a well-by-well basis and then these measurements are used as calibration points to convert 3 D seismic data (if available) to geomechanical models. However, elastic properties measured this way are restricted to the well location and interpolation across the reservoir may not be always appropriate. To overcome these challenges, this paper describes an integrated approach for deriving 3 D geomechanical models of the reservoir by combining results of 3 D geocellular models and basin models. The basin model reconstructs the geologic history (i.e., burial history) of the reservoir by back-stripping it to the original depositional thickness. Through this reconstruction, the mechanical compaction, pore pressures, effective stress, and porosity versus depth relationships are established. Next, these mechanical properties are discretized into 3 D geocellular grid using empirical formulas via lithofacies model even if no 3 D seismic data are available for the reservoir. The discretization of elastic properties into 3 D grids results in a better understanding of the prevailing stress regimes and helping in design of hydraulic fracturing operations with minimal risks and costs. This approach provides an innovative way of determining effective horizontal stress for the entire reservoir through 3 D distribution of elastic properties.|$|E

The {{successful}} {{development of}} shale gas requires a fundamental understanding of shales {{and that can}} be challenging because these rocks vary significantly. For recoverable shale gas resources assessment a broad range of geological, geochemical, geophysical and geomechanical data is required. Information about the variable lithologies, mineralogies, and kerogen content is vital to locate favorable intervals for gas production. Knowledge of the in-situ stresses and porosity of these intervals is essential for developing hydraulic fracturing strategies to recover the gas in place. <b>Geomechanical</b> <b>properties</b> of shales are important in terms of determination of the likelihood of fractures initiating and propagating in shale materials. <b>Geomechanical</b> <b>properties</b> of rock include: Poisson's Ratio, Total Minimum Horizontal Stress, Bulk, Young and Shear Modulus.

During the gasification process, petro-physical and <b>geomechanical</b> <b>properties</b> undergo a drastic change due to heating to elevated temperatures.

40|$|In this research, a novel, unique {{systematic}} {{procedure was}} implemented {{to investigate the}} influence of the fracture networks and confining stresses on the jointed coal mass strength (JCMS). Both a laboratory experimental scheme and a numerical modeling scheme were carried out at the 3 -D level. The laboratory experiments were performed to achieve the following three goals. Firstly, the geomechanical properties for the intact coal and coal discontinuities were estimated through the laboratory <b>geomechanical</b> <b>property</b> tests. Secondly, naturally existing fracture networks in the cubic coal blocks were first detected by the industrial Computed Tomography (CT) scanning technique and then quantified by the fracture tensor based methodology. Thirdly, polyaxial tests were conducted on the same cubic coal blocks to obtain the JCMS values under different confining stresses. With respect to the numerical modeling, PFC^ 3 D and 3 DEC software packages were used to simulate the polyaxial compression tests for intact and jointed cubic coal blocks, respectively. From more than twenty intact rock strength criteria, nine criteria were selected for this research. The intact coal strength data bank obtained from PFC^ 3 D modeling was used to evaluate the applicability of nine different intact rock strength criteria. A modified grid search (MGS) procedure is proposed and used to find the best fitting parameter values and calculate the coefficient of determination (R²) values for each criterion. These criteria are compared in detail using the following features: R² values, σ₁ - σ₂ plots for different σ₃, shapes on the deviatoric planes, linearity or nonlinearity on the meridian planes. The regression analysis and the MGS procedure were found to be equivalent in finding the best fitting parameter values for a certain intact rock strength criterion. Through the comparisons, the modified Wiebols-Cook and modified Lade criteria were found to provide the highest R² values and fit the intact coal strength data best on the σ₁ - σ₂ coordinate plane and meridian planes. Based on the appearances on the deviatoric plane, the nine intact rock strength criteria are categorized into three types: the single shear stress criteria, the octahedral shear stress criteria and the criteria incorporating the maximum principal shear stress and partial intermediate principal shear stress. The relative positions of the different criteria on two specific meridian planes are also discussed. The geometric model of the jointed coal block was first set up by incorporating the fracture network constructed from the CT scanning into the intact coal block using a modified fictitious joint procedure. The numerical parameter values of intact coal and coal discontinuities were then calibrated and validated through a trial and error procedure using the laboratory test results of some selected samples. Next the JCMS data bank was consummated by performing a four-phase numerical investigation on several jointed coal blocks having selected fracture networks and five additional artificial fracture networks under different confining stress combinations. Finally, a new empirical coal mass strength criterion was developed to estimate the JCMS values at the 3 -D level. The developed new model is capable of capturing the scale effect and anisotropic strength behaviors. It can also be applied to rock masses having approximately orthogonal fracture systems or for masses where fracture system can be reduced to an equivalent orthogonal fracture system. The following new contributions were made in this dissertation to advance the existing state-of-art on the dissertation topic: (a) A new, unique methodology as shown in Fig. 1. 1 incorporating the following aspects was used to develop a new 3 -D coal mass strength criterion: a complete set of <b>geomechanical</b> <b>property</b> tests, fracture network detection and quantification, polyaxial compression tests, numerical decomposition techniques; (b) A new procedure was developed to construct the fracture network in the coal cubes starting from CT scans to perform numerical modeling using 3 DEC. In this procedure, a modified fictitious joint framework was also proposed to extend the applicability of the original fictitious joint framework, which allows incorporating a large quantity of non-persistent joints with acceptable numerical calculation effort; (c) A new 3 -D coal mass strength criterion was developed to incorporate the fracture network and 3 -D confining stress system to capture the anisotropy and scale effect of coal mass strength. The proposed criterion not only includes {{the influence of the}} intermediate principal stress, which is ignored by some existing strength criteria, but also includes the intensity and orientation and size probability distributions of the fracture system explicitly by a fracture tensor based methodology, which is far more advanced than most of the current criteria that are based on rock mass classification systems having only scalar indices; (d) A modified grid search procedure was proposed and used to evaluate the applicability of nine different intact rock strength criteria. The best intact rock strength criteria applicable for the intact coal data obtained through PFC^ 3 D modeling were found by performing the most detailed intact rock strength criteria evaluation incorporating σ₁ - σ₂ - σ₃ plots and behaviors on the deviatoric and meridian planes, which improves the understanding of the available intact rock strength criteria...|$|E
40|$|Underground {{excavations}} {{break the}} balance of the initial stress field and cause stress redistributions in the surrounding rock masses. Problems normally arise as the stress exceeds the rock mass strength. In addition, the rock mass contains preexisting defects, such as the fissures, fractures, joints, faults, shear zones, dikes, etc., which could significantly weaken the rock mass strength and make the rock mass behavior complicated. The stability of underground excavations is of great importance to an operating mine project since it ensures the safety of the working environment and the successful ore exploration. Due to the complex geological conditions and engineering disturbances, the assessment of rock mass stability for a practical engineering problem is extremely challenging and difficult, which needs to be solved by the modern numerical methods. In this dissertation, the rock mass stability around tunnels in an underground mine in the USA was investigated by performing three-dimensional modeling using the 3 DEC 3 -Dimensional Distinct Element Code. Comprehensive stress analyses were respectively carried out on a preliminary model and a more advanced model. In the preliminary study, the built model contains the inclined lithologies, a non-persistent fault, and a convoluted tunnel system. The <b>geomechanical</b> <b>property</b> values used for the rock masses and discontinuities in the numerical model were estimated using the available geotechnical information and the experience of the research group. The Mohr-Coulomb and strain softening constitutive relations were prescribed for the rock masses; the coulomb slip joint model was assigned for the discontinuities. The influence of the boundary conditions, block constitutive models, horizontal in situ stress and rock support system on the tunnel stability was investigated. The rock mass behavior was quantified using the results of stress, displacement, and yielded zones around the tunnels. It showed that the roller boundary conditions resulted in slightly different but comparable results with the combined boundary conditions (roller and stress combined) where K 0 equals to 0. 4 or 0. 5. Whereas the in-situ stress field for a complex geological system can only be obtained by applying proper boundary stresses and then by performing stress analysis. The softening behavior of the rock masses caused more deformations and yielded zones around the tunnels; the rock masses around the tunnels were observed to reach the residual strength values, which can be treated as failed areas. In addition, the M-C and s-s rock masses reacted differently as the K 0 value changed. At K 0 = 1. 0, the tunnels seemed to be the most stable; K 0 = 1. 5, however, provided the worst scenario with roof and floor problems. With respect to the effectiveness of the support system, a large amount of the bonds of the supports was failing, thus, the deformations and yielded zones around the tunnels were slightly improved. Finally, comparisons between the numerical modeling results and the field measurements implied the applicability of strain softening behavior and a K 0 value between 0. 5 and 1. 0 for the mine. Based on the specific geological, geotechnical, and construction information, a numerical model incorporating accurate features was developed. It includes a non-planar, weak interlayer, the persistent and non-persistent faults, and the open and backfilled excavations. The mechanical property values used for the rock masses and faults were estimated based on the laboratory test results of the intact rock and smooth joints. The strain softening behavior was specified for the rock masses belonging to the average quality, and the rock masses that reached residual strengths were assumed to be failing. The linear relations between the fault stiffnesses and normal stress were described using the continuously yielding joint model. To simulate the mine construction process in the field, the sequential excavation, backfilling, and supporting procedures were numerically implemented; additionally, a novel routine was applied to account for the delayed installation of the supports. Results showed that the tunnels close to the fault and the backfilled area were less stable. Most of the displacements around the tunnels occurred within a distance of zero to 2 or 3 m from the tunnel surface. The varying K 0 value caused great changes in the rock mass behavior and the shear behavior of the major fault; significant instability of the tunnels was triggered by the high horizontal in situ stress. Parametric studies on the rock mass condition, rock mass residual strengths, and fault property values showed that the tunnel stability was more sensitive to the former two factors than the last one. A systematic investigation was conducted to evaluate the current rock supports installed at the mine where the increasing stress relaxation was incorporated. The deformations and of the failure zone thicknesses around the tunnels were reduced up to 8...|$|E

40|$|Potentially {{unstable}} salt caverns of AkzoNobel {{need to be}} stabilised with {{a suitable}} backfill material {{in order to prevent}} surface subsidence. These caverns are currently filled with Carbonate and Gypsum slurry, a residual product of the brine purification process, but a new backfill material is being developed for stabilisation purposes. At the bottom of the cavern, a layer with sump material could have an influence on the backfilling process. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the <b>geomechanical</b> <b>properties</b> of the backfill material, the Carbonate and Gypsum slurry and the sump material by comparing the <b>geomechanical</b> <b>properties</b> and thereby contributing to AkzoNobel’s project Pilot Stabilisation Caverns Twente. It is hypothesised that the <b>geomechanical</b> <b>properties</b> of the new developed backfill material are better suited for stabilisation compared to the Carbonate and Gypsum slurry. However, it is expected that the Carbonate and Gypsum slurry is still suited for stabilising a potential unstable cavern. For the sump material, it is expected that the permeability of the material decreases during consolidation, which is advantageous for its barrier function. In order to evaluate the hypothesis, a numerical model was developed using bearing capacity calculations, to show to what extent the cavern potentially migrates when backfilling is carried out and what the applied load of the debris column would be. Secondly, the <b>geomechanical</b> <b>properties</b> of the Carbonate and Gypsum slurry and sump material were investigated by laboratory experiments, including the particle size distribution, mineral content and compressibility of the material. The third step was to compare the <b>geomechanical</b> <b>properties</b> in terms of total settlement and stiffness development of the Carbonate and Gypsum slurry and sump material with the new developed backfill material. A case study of Cavern 165 evaluates whether the Carbonate and Gypsum slurry is suited for stabilising an unstable cavern, based on the calculated and measured <b>geomechanical</b> <b>properties.</b> For the Carbonate and Gypsum slurry and sump material, the primary and secondary consolidation phases were indistinguishable. Even after two weeks of consolidation for a single load step, continuous settlement seemed to occur for the Carbonate and Gypsum slurry. This could be an indication that compaction creep occurs. This behaviour was also obtained for the backfill material. Compaction creep is a process that continues until the void ratio becomes zero. In terms of total settlement and stiffness development, the backfill material and Carbonate and Gypsum slurry showed comparable behaviour on the short term (i. e. after 10 days). However, when assuming compaction creep up to 1000 years, the backfill material is better suited in terms of total settlement and stiffness development on the long term. When it is assumed that compaction creep for the Carbonate and Gypsum slurry takes place for approximately 1000 years, the slurry is able to stabilise a potential unstable cavern when the cavern is filled for at least 81 %. Since the void ratio of the Carbonate and Gypsum slurry was already low after 10 days of loading, the expected compaction creep would probably stop at an earlier stage. The total consolidation of the slurry should be taken into account when determining the fill volumes of the caverns. During backfilling, the Carbonate and Gypsum slurry or new developed backfill material penetrates through the voids of the sump rock at the bottom of the cavern. This results in consolidation of the fine sump fraction and a loss of backfill volume. Since the void ratio of the sump material decreased during consolidation, it is assumed that the permeability also decreased, but the order of magnitude is unknown. Hence, more research is required to investigate the decrease in permeability due to loading, in order to conclude whether the decrease is sufficient to be advantageous for the barrier function of the sump material. Furthermore, it is recommended to evaluate the time dependency of the consolidation of the backfill material, the Carbonate and Gypsum slurry and the sump material. Since consolidation of the materials continues in the worst case until the void ratio e becomes zero, it is likely that the assumed compaction creep already stops at an earlier stage, making 1000 years of compaction creep a very conservative assumption.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{determination of}} <b>geomechanical</b> <b>properties</b> such as uniaxial compressive strength and shear strength requires considerable time in collecting appropriate samples, their preparation and laboratory testing. To minimize {{the time and}} cost, a number of empirical relations have been reported which are widely used for the estimation of complex rock properties from more easily acquired data. This paper reports {{the use of an}} artificial neural network to predict the deformation properties of Coal Measure rocks using dynamic wave velocity, point load index, slake durability index and density. The results confirm the applicability of this method...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the {{variations}} caused by high temperature to the mechanical properties {{is a vital}} asset in processes such as underground coal gasification (UCG), in-situ disposal of nuclear waste and during the recovery of geothermal. The study can also provide valuable insights during the restoration of fire-damaged buildings. Due {{to the presence of}} heat, changes in rock morphology and mineralogy lead to a substantial change in the <b>geomechanical</b> <b>properties</b> of rock. Effect of high temperatures (1000 degrees C) on the tensile and compressive strength of a fine-grained Indian Sandstone have been analysed in this study. Induced ductility, observed at temperatures above 500 degrees C causes the rock to exhibit properties similar to that of a plastic material. The <b>geomechanical</b> <b>properties</b> decrease sharply beyond 500 degrees C, which has been referred to as the critical temperature of the rock. Beyond the critical temperature, internal structure of the rock undergoes considerable damage in the form of microcracks and fissures created due to phase transition of quartz at 573 degrees C and generation of thermal stress. Change in internal structure and mineralogy have been analysed by performing XRD (X-ray powder diffraction) and FDXM (Four-dimensional X-ray microscopy) studies. With the help of FDXM, change in porosity of rock has been analysed by studying the variation in connected and non-connected pores...|$|R
30|$|In {{unconventional}} tight reservoirs, where {{hydraulic fracturing}} {{is the key}} technique for enhanced oil production, a thorough knowledge of distribution of <b>geomechanical</b> <b>properties</b> helps to maximize return on investment. Horizontal wells with multistage hydraulic stimulation are the primary production strategies during development of the unconventional tight reservoirs. It is therefore important to understand in situ stress conditions such as effective minimum horizontal stress as it guides the stimulation design which will in turn control the fracture propagation. Accuracy of effective minimum horizontal stress model is primarily dependent on knowledge of the spatial distribution of reservoir’s elastic property.|$|R

A new computer controlled hydraulic press with large set of adaptive accessories could meet the demands. With EU support of the project Institute of Clean Technologies for Mining and Utilization of Raw Materials for Energy Use (CZ. 1. 05 / 2. 1. 00 / 03. 0082), a new Rock Mechanics System of the MTS Corporation was purchased, installed and put into operation...|$|R
40|$|Non-destructive tools {{capable of}} {{measuring}} the condition and <b>geomechanical</b> <b>properties</b> of construction materials through time are of considerable value in engineering. Here, {{the ability of}} the Equotip durometer (Proceq, type D) to detect changes in the hardness of concrete and rock exposed to marine conditions was tested. Results indicated a progressive loss of hardness for limestone, while concrete hardness increased. Granite showed no significant change. Our results relate to alteration of the materials primarily via chemical and biological weathering. The Equotip is sensitive enough to detect subtle changes in the condition of construction materials over relatively short periods of time...|$|R

Emphasis {{is placed on the}} three basic ground control parameters: ground pressure, ground movement, and <b>geomechanical</b> <b>properties.</b> Specific topics include premining ground pressures, front-abutment pressure in the longwall panel, histories of pillar loading, differential roof-strata movement and bed separation, differential floor strata movement, entry roof-to-floor convergence, in situ moduli of rigidity of coal seam and roof and floor strata, and mechanical properties of coal and coal measures rocks...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on changes of <b>geomechanical</b> <b>properties</b> with regard to loss of {{long-term}} resistance in studies {{on the influence of}} salt spray on the structure of selected rocks from Poland. The investigation has shown that the analyzed rock material shows variable susceptibility to this corrosive factor. The most susceptible to ageing by salt mist were Śmiłów sandstones, whose progressive deterioration was observed in subsequent cycles. Analysis of resistance parameters has shown decreased resistance to uniaxial compression exceeding 30 % also {{in the case of the}} Józefów limestones. Limestones from Raciszyn have revealed high resistance to ageing by salt mist...|$|R
40|$|A coupled Biot model {{based on}} a three-field formulation, namely displacement-pressure-velocity, is set-up and used for the {{prediction}} of land subsidence in the Chaobai River alluvial fan, China, north-east of Beijing. The area has a regional size and has been recently characterized by a detailed statistical distribution of hydrofacies. The resulting model totals about 5 million unknowns with strong heterogeneities in the hydraulic and <b>geomechanical</b> <b>properties</b> distribution. The proposed numerical formulation allows for an efficient and accurate solution for a sample discharge from an existing well field, thus proving a robust computational tool for the forecast {{and management of the}} land subsidence risk in the area...|$|R
