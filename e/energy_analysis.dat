40|$|The {{validity}} of the application of <b>energy</b> flow <b>analysis</b> for beam structures under random excitations is investigated in this paper. The approximate solutions of energy density and intensity in a beam subject to random loadings are obtained by solving the governing equation of random <b>energy</b> flow <b>analysis</b> using Fourier transform technique. The formulations of the exact energy density distribution and intensity in the beam are derived using the classical modal analysis method. For a simply supported beam subject to distributed or concentrated random excitations, the {{validity of}} random <b>energy</b> flow <b>analysis</b> is investigated through comparisons between solutions obtained from the approximate and exact methods for energy response as well as intensity. The results indicate that, the mode count of the analysis frequency band, which means the number of modes involved in the band, is the key factor affecting the prediction accuracy of random <b>energy</b> flow <b>analysis,</b> and that if the mode count of the band is sufficiently large, random <b>energy</b> flow <b>analysis</b> can provide rather accurate estimates for both energy density and intensity in a wide frequency range...|$|R

25|$|A {{problem the}} <b>energy</b> <b>analysis</b> method cannot resolve is that {{different}} energy forms (heat, electricity, chemical energy etc.) have different quality and value even in natural sciences, {{as a consequence}} of the two main laws of thermodynamics. A thermodynamic measure of the quality of energy is exergy. According to the first law of thermodynamics, all energy inputs should be accounted with equal weight, whereas by the second law diverse energy forms should be accounted by different values.|$|E
25|$|A {{criticism}} of LCEA {{is that it}} attempts to eliminate monetary cost analysis; that is replace the currency by which economic decisions are made with an energy currency. It has also been argued that energy efficiency is only one consideration in deciding which alternative process to employ, and {{that it should not}} be elevated to the only criterion for determining environmental acceptability; for example, simple <b>energy</b> <b>analysis</b> {{does not take into account}} the renewability of energy flows or the toxicity of waste products; however the life cycle assessment does help companies become more familiar with environmental properties and improve their environmental system. Incorporating Dynamic LCAs of renewable energy technologies (using sensitivity analyses to project future improvements in renewable systems and their share of the power grid) may help mitigate this criticism.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} study the inelastic {{scattering}} of the helium atom beam due only to single-phonon contributions, an <b>energy</b> <b>analysis</b> {{needs to be made}} of the scattered atoms. [...] The most popular {{way to do this is}} through the use of time-of-flight (TOF) analysis. [...] The TOF analysis requires the beam to be pulsed through the mechanical chopper, producing collimated beam 'packets' that have a 'time-of-flight' (TOF) to travel from the chopper to the detector. [...] The beams that scatter inelastically will lose some energy in their encounter with the surface and therefore have a different velocity after scattering than they were incident with. [...] The creation or annihilation of surface phonons can be measured, therefore, by the shifts in the energy of the scattered beam. [...] By changing the scattering angles or incident beam energy, it is possible to sample inelastic scattering at different values of energy and momentum transfer, mapping out the dispersion relations for the surface modes. [...] Analyzing the dispersion curves reveals sought-after information about the surface structure and bonding. [...] A TOF analysis plot would show intensity peaks as a function of time. [...] The main peak (with the highest intensity) is that for the unscattered helium beam 'packet'. [...] A peak to the left is that for the annihilation of a phonon. [...] If a phonon creation process occurred, it would appear as a peak to the right: ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>analysis</b> of <b>energy</b> flow in complex, {{built-up}} structures at {{high frequencies}} requires new methods due to well-documented problems with other analysis approaches. Current analysis tools {{cannot be used}} to model the spatial variations of the response or are computationally expensive. <b>Energy</b> flow <b>analysis</b> addresses these aspects but introduces several new problems. In particular, <b>energy</b> flow <b>analysis</b> requires data about the energy flow, loss factor, and group speed of a structural element and the power reflection and transmission characteristics of joints that connect structural elements. It is not always possible to estimate all of these required <b>energy</b> flow <b>analysis</b> parameters analytically and existing experimental techniques are poorly adapted to this purpose. Thus, new experimental alternatives are required. A series of wavenumber domain techniques are investigated for structures composed of beam elements. Methods for the estimation of energy density, energy flow, group speed, loss factor, and flexural wave power reflection and transmission coefficients of joints are developed. The methods meet the goal of providing a simple engineering method for the experimental <b>analysis</b> of <b>energy</b> flow in complex, built-up structures. The techniques {{can be used to}} estimate <b>energy</b> flow <b>analysis</b> parameters at high frequencies, in the presence of measurement noise, and in situ. One set of appropriately acquired data can be analyzed to estimate all of the <b>energy</b> flow <b>analysis</b> parameters. Case studies of several structures are presented that demonstrate the utility of the wavenumber domain techniques. ...|$|R

40|$|Simulation models become {{increasingly}} important in <b>energy</b> policy <b>analysis.</b> A literature review showed that there is demand for analysing the effect of multiple more realistic investment algorithms on the outcomes of <b>energy</b> policy <b>analysis.</b> The reason is that <b>energy</b> policy <b>analysis</b> could be incomplete without insight in {{the implications of the}} assumed investment behaviour in simulation models. The research question is: How is the effectiveness of the EU-ETS mechanism affected by diverse investment algorithms in an electricity market simulation model? In EMlab-generation, three modular empirical data based algorithms are designed including behaviour with technology-preferences, credit-risk considerations and risk-averse behaviour. The results showed that more realistic investment behaviour culminates in all experiments in at least one or more technologies with substantially different investment patterns. Different investment patterns caused a lowered CO 2 price volatility in most experiments in relation to homogeneous profit only behaviour indicating that the CO 2 price might be a more stable investment signal than earlier assumed. The effectiveness of the EU-ETS mechanism remains for all experiments however doubtful due to the substantial CO 2 price volatility of more than 100 %. The necessity of stabilizing measures such as a price floor and/or ceiling proposed by previous studies is reinforced by the results. This research shows the importance of being aware of the implications of the assumed investment behaviour in simulation models used for <b>energy</b> policy <b>analysis.</b> Two recommendations to deal with the implications of the assumed investment behaviour in models is to design more flexible and modular investment algorithms. Flexibility and modularity in investment algorithms enable and support exploring the effect of different behavioural configurations on outcomes of <b>energy</b> policy <b>analysis.</b> <b>Energy</b> & IndustryTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|R
