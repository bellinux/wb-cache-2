40|$|CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) {{have emerged}} as {{the most common type}} of ESBL globally, their {{incidence}} easily surpassing those of SHV and TEM ESBLs in most locales. This study compared the performance of two MicroScan dried panels with CLSI reference broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods on a collection of genetically characterized ESBL-producing isolates. These included 64 Enterobacteriaceae isolates that produced CTX-M 8, - 14, - 15, or - 16 according to PCR and sequencing of the bla gene, 17 isolates that produced a SHV or TEM ESBL, and 19 that produced both CTX-M and SHV ESBLs. Each isolate was tested by a <b>frozen</b> <b>reference</b> microdilution panel, the MicroScan ESβL plus confirmation panel, and a routine dried panel containing streamlined ESBL confirmation dilutions (MicroScan Neg MIC panel type 32) that included cefotaxime and ceftazidime tested alone or with a fixed concentration of 4 μg/ml of clavulanate. Each isolate was also tested by the standard CLSI double-disk confirmation tests. The disk diffusion method detected all ESBL-producing isolates, the <b>frozen</b> <b>reference</b> panel detected 90 % of isolates (10 out of 100 could not be analyzed because of off-scale MICs that exceeded the clavulanate combination concentrations in the panel), the ESβL plus panel detected 98 % (1 missed and 1 off scale), and the streamlined ESBL panel detected 95 % (5 off scale). Very high MICs for a few strains that produced SHV or both CTX-M and SHV ESBLs precluded noting the required three twofold-dilution differences with clavulanate needed to confirm an ESBL primarily in the reference panel and the Neg type 32 panel...|$|E
40|$|The {{comparability}} of {{test results}} for protein S between laboratories is hampered {{by a high}} inter-laboratory variability. The effect of the use and type of common reference plasma on the inter-laboratory variability of the total and free protein S measurement was evaluated. The results of 10 plasma samples measured against a centrally distributed frozen plasma and a centrally distributed lyophilized plasma were {{compared with those of}} various local reference plasmas regularly used by the 11 participating laboratories. The mean intra-assay coefficient of variation for total protein S in each laboratory varied from 3. 8 to 12. 8 % (mean intra-assay CV of all laboratories: 7. 4 +/- 2. 3 %); for free protein S this range was 3. 1 to 13. 3 % (mean intra-assay CV of all laboratories: 6. 6 +/- 2. 7 %). We confirmed the high inter-laboratory coefficient of variation (mean+/-SD) with the several local reference plasmas for both total protein S (13. 4 +/- 5. 6 %; n = 10) and free protein S (17. 1 +/- 7. 5 %: n = 11). For total protein S, the inter-laboratory CV was reduced to 11. 5 +/- 4. 8 %, (p= 0. 05) by using a common <b>frozen</b> <b>reference</b> plasma, while it was increased to 16. 8 +/- 3. 4 %, (p= 0. 022) using a common lyophilized reference plasma. For free protein S, these values decreased only statistically significantly for the common lyophilized reference plasma, to 15. 1 +/- 6. 0 %, (p = 0. 008). For free protein S, the dilution factor used was identified as a factor influencing the inter-laboratory variability. This study shows that, for both types of protein S measurements, using one <b>frozen</b> <b>reference</b> plasma shows a slight decrease in inter-laboratory variability, while a common lyophilized plasma shows inconsistent results. It is concluded that further investigation is necessary to examine other sources of variability to increase the comparability of laboratory results for both total and free protein S...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the problem}} of the autonomous control of a satellite in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) using an optimum controller. The type of controller considered is a standard Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). As the problem can also be treated as a two-satellites-formation control {{in which there is no}} cancellation of the common perturbative forces, its formulation is similar to that used in formation flying control problems. The driving orbit control requirement is to keep the satellite orbit within a maximum absolute distance of 250 m (r. m. s.) from a sun-synchronous, phased and <b>frozen</b> <b>reference</b> orbit. The control action is realized by means of in-plane and out of-plane thrusts whose cost is minimized by the optimal solution of the control problem. The PRISMA dual satellite mission flight software development and test environment is used as a first test-bed to validate the control algorithms. The PRISMA flight software and test environment allows a very realistic validation of the proposed control techniques. The TerraSAR-X mission scenario is use as a second test-bed for the validation of the control algorithm as it is a very representative example of LEO satellite for Earth observation with high demanding orbit control accuracy requirements...|$|E

40|$|Histopathology {{archives}} of well-annotated formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens are valuable resources for retrospective studies of human diseases. Since recovery of quality intact mRNA compatible with molecular techniques {{is often difficult}} due to degradation, we evaluated microRNA (miRNA), a novel class of small RNA molecules with growing therapeutic and diagnostic potential, as an alternative analyte for gene expression studies of FFPE samples. Analyzing total RNA yield, miRNA recovery, and robustness of real-time polymerase chain reaction for miRNA, mRNA, and rRNA species, we compared the performance of commercially available RNA isolation kits and identified a preferred methodology. We further implemented modifications to increase tissue throughput and incorporate a quantitative Armored RNA process control to monitor RNA recovery efficiency. The optimized process was tested for reproducibility as well as interoperator and interday variability, and was validated {{with a set of}} 30 clinical samples. In addition, we demonstrated that, independent of FFPE block age and RNA quality, miRNAs generate quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction signals that are more robust and better correlate with expression levels from <b>frozen</b> <b>reference</b> samples compared with longer mRNAs.

Subcutaneous xenografts of three human breast cancer cell lines with increasing metastatic potential (MCF- 7 [*]<[*]MDA-MB- 468 [*]<[*]MDA-MB- 231, N[*]≥[*] 5 for each line) were grown to 6 – 10  mm in diameter in athymic nude mice for the 3 D redox scanning. Another two MDA-MB- 231 tumor xenografts (> 10  mm in diameter and with an apparent necrotic center, average tumor volume[*]=[*] 989  mm 3) and two MCF- 7 tumor xenografts (> 10  mm in diameter, average tumor volume[*]=[*] 750  mm 3) were used for simultaneous imaging of Pyro- 2 DG uptake and the redox state. Pyro- 2 DG was administered to the anesthetized mice through tail vein injection at a dosage of ~ 2.5 mg/kg after the tumor-bearing mice were starved for 24 hrs. In approximately two hours, the anesthetized mice were snap-frozen using liquid nitrogen. The snap-freezing protocol maintained the in vivo mitochondrial redox state for the ex vivo redox scanning. The preparation of tissue samples for the redox scanning were previously described (Xu et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2009 a).

Levels of some but not all cytokines in serum increased in HIV infection. There was a tendency for cytokines to increase with more advanced disease, defined by reduced CD 4 T-cell numbers. Cytokine changes did not relate closely to CD 4 level, indicating that separate information was provided by the measurements of TNF-α, sTNF-RII, sIL- 2 Rα, β 2 M, and neopterin.

Copyright:Materials and methods: Tissue samples of heart, liver and kidney were prospectively collected from 24 MIAs followed by CA, and compared to corresponding archival fresh frozen tissue. After RNA isolation and RT-qPCR, RNA integrity numbers (RIN) and GAPDH expression (six amplicon sizes ranging from 71 to 530 base pairs) were measured. RIN values and GAPDH Cq values were analyzed and compared between all sample groups and post-mortem intervals (PMI). Results: RIN values in MIA samples were significantly higher than those in CA samples.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel pathway {{analysis}} of super-exchange electronic couplings in electron transfer reactions using localized molecular orbitals from multi-configuration self-consistent field (MCSCF) calculations. In our analysis, the electronic coupling and the tunneling pathways {{can be calculated}} {{in terms of the}} configuration interaction (CI) Hamiltonian matrix obtained from the localized MCSCF wave function. Making use of the occupation restricted multiple active spaces (ORMAS) method can effectively produce the donor, acceptor, and intermediate configuration state functions (CSFs) and CIs among these CSFs. In order to express the electronic coupling as a sum of individual tunneling pathways contributions, we employed two perturbative methods: Löwdin projection-iteration method and higher-order super-exchange method. We applied them to anion couplings of butane- 1, 4 -diyl and pentane- 1, 5 -diyl. The results were (1) the electronic couplings calculated from the two perturbative methods were in reasonable agreement with those from a non-perturbative method (one-half value of the energy difference between the ground and first excited states), (2) the main tunneling pathways consisted of a small number of lower-order super-exchange pathways where bonding, anti-bonding, or extra-valence-shell orbitals were used once or twice, and (3) the interference among a huge number of higher-order super-exchange pathways significantly contributed to the overall electronic coupling, whereas each of them contributed only fractionally. Our method can adequately take into account both effects of non-dynamical electron correlation and orbital relaxation.

40|$|Martensites are {{metastable}} phases, {{possessing a}} characteristic morphology, usually formed during a fast quench accross a structural transition. We {{attempt to understand}} these morphological features using a coarsegrained free energy functional F[ϵ; Φ] which contains, {{in addition to the}} usual strain fields ϵ_ij (the " order parameter" for the transition), the "vacancy" field ϕ which arises due to the geometric mismatch at a parent-product interface. The relaxation of this mismatch is slow compared to typical front propagation times and hence ϕ is essentially <b>frozen</b> in the <b>reference</b> frame of the growing martensite front. Minimisation of F then automatically yeilds typical martensite morphologies.

40|$|Abstract: The direct {{determination}} of element signatures in polar ice core samples from Greenland by laser ablation with subsequent {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry analysis has been investigated. A cryogenic sample chamber enables the element determination in ice directly from the solid (frozen) state. A procedure was developed to analyse up to 38 elements (traces: Mg, Al, Fe, Zn, Cd, Pb and rare earth elements; minor constituents: Na) in ice samples from Greenland with a previously not achieved spatial resolution of 4 mm along the core axis. This resolution is helpful to detect seasonal variations of element concentration in thin annual layers of deep-ice. We report operating conditions and analytical performance of the experimental set up, the improvement of signal stability by 17 OH internal standardisation and applying of a desolvation unit. Calibration of the system was performed with frozen multielement standard solutions along a special preparation procedure. Detection limits for the tracers Na, Mg (sea salt), Al (mineral dust) and Zn (anthropogenic source) are between 0. 1 - 1 µgkg- 1. Best detection limits {{in the range of}} 0. 001 - 0. 01 µgkg- 1 were reached for Co, Pb and all rare earth elements. To validate the method, <b>frozen</b> standard <b>reference</b> materials were measured. The recovery is about ± 10 %. Greenland ice core samples from different ages were analysed with the new technique. The results obtained by laser ablation were compared with values from solution analysis, available published data and the particle content. Most elements have shown good correlation with the particle content in the Greenland samples, however, differences could be seen between the values obtained by laser ablation and solution bulk analysis after a tri-acid digestion. The influence of particles is discussed. The high spatial resolved 2 d-mapping of element concentrations show strong inhomogeneities along the core axis most probably due to seasonal variations of element deposition.

The paper presents results of the assessment of these methods in the whole-model and per-residue accuracy modes. Scores from four different model evaluation packages were used as the 'ground truth' for assessing accuracy of methods' estimates. They include a rigid-body score - GDT_TS, and three local-structure based scores - LDDT, CAD and SphereGrinder. The ability of methods to identify best models from among several available, predict model's absolute accuracy score, distinguish between good and bad models, predict accuracy of the coordinate error self-estimates, and discriminate between reliable and unreliable regions in the models was assessed. Single-model methods advanced {{to the point where}} they are better than clustering methods in picking the best models from decoy sets.

40|$|Introduction: Antiretroviral {{resistance}} {{leads to}} treatment failure and resistance transmission. Resistance data in western Kenya are limited. Collection of non-plasma analytes may provide additional resistance information. Methods: We assessed HIV diversity using the REGA tool, transmitted resistance by the WHO mutation list and acquired resistance upon first-line failure by the IAS–USA mutation list, at the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH), a major treatment programme in western Kenya. Plasma and four non-plasma analytes, dried blood-spots (DBS), dried plasma-spots (DPS), ViveSTTM-plasma (STP) and ViveST-blood (STB), {{were compared to}} identify diversity and evaluate sequence concordance. Results: Among 122 patients, 62 were treatment-naïve and 60 treatment-experienced; 61 % were female, median age 35 years, median CD 4 182 cells/µL, median viral-load 4. 6 log 10 copies/mL. One hundred and ninety-six sequences were available for 107 / 122 (88 %) patients, 58 / 62 (94 %) treatment-naïve and 49 / 60 (82 %) treated; 100 / 122 (82 %) plasma, 37 / 78 (47 %) attempted DBS, 16 / 45 (36 %) attempted DPS, 14 / 44 (32 %) attempted STP from fresh plasma and 23 / 34 (68 %) from frozen plasma, and 5 / 42 (12 %) attempted STB. Plasma and DBS genotyping success increased at higher VL and shorter shipment-to-genotyping time. Main subtypes were A (62 %), D (15 %) and C (6 %). Transmitted resistance was found in 1. 8 % of plasma sequences, and 7 % combining analytes. Plasma resistance mutations were identified in 91 % of treated patients, 76 % NRTI, 91 % NNRTI; 76 % dual-class; 60 % with intermediate-high predicted resistance to future treatment options; with novel mutation co-occurrence patterns. Nearly 88 % of plasma mutations were identified in DBS, 89 % in DPS and 94 % in STP. Of 23 discordant mutations, 92 % in plasma and 60 % in non-plasma analytes were mixtures. Mean whole-sequence discordance from <b>frozen</b> plasma <b>reference</b> was 1. 1 % for plasma-DBS, 1. 2 % plasma-DPS, 2. 0 % plasma-STP and 2. 3 % plasma-STB. Of 23 plasma-STP discordances, one mutation was identified in plasma and 22 in STP (p< 0. 05). Discordance was inversely significantly related to VL for DBS. Conclusions: In a large treatment programme in western Kenya, we report high HIV- 1 subtype diversity; low plasma transmitted resistance, increasing when multiple analytes were combined; and high-acquired resistance with unique mutation patterns. Resistance surveillance may be augmented by using non-plasma analytes for lower-cost genotyping in resource-limited settings...|$|R

Galectin- 3 concentrations were higher in plasma samples than in serum samples and correlated well between fresh and frozen samples (R= 0. 997), between the routine and STAT assays, between the ARCHITECT i 1000 and i 2000 instruments and with the galectin- 3 ELISA. The reference interval on 627 apparently healthy individuals (53 % male) yielded upper 95 th and 97. 5 th percentiles of 25. 2 and 28. 4 ng/mL, respectively. Values were significantly lower in subjects younger than 50 years. CONCLUSIONS: The galectin- 3 routine and STAT assays on the Abbott ARCHITECT instruments demonstrated good analytical performance. Further clinical studies are required to demonstrate the diagnostic and prognostic potential of this novel marker in patients with CHF...|$|R
40|$|Application of LA-ICP-MS in {{polar ice}} core studiesReinhardt, H., Kriews, M., Miller, H., AWI Bremerhaven/DLüdke C., Hoffmann E., Skole J., ISAS Berlin/DDr. Heiko Reinhardt, Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research,Am Handelshafen 12, 27570 BremerhavenEmail: hreinhardt@awi-bremerhaven. deThe direct {{determination}} of element signatures in polar ice core samples from Greenland by laser ablation with subsequent {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry analysis has been investigated. The ice shields of the polar regions are important climate archives and they provide useful insight {{to the history of}} the Earth climate back to about 500, 000 years. The analysis of element signatures in ice cores yields information about the strength of sources and transport mechanisms for aerosols in the paleoatmosphere as well as about the paleovolcanism. By means of a laserbeam at a wavelength of 1064 nm material from the ice surface is ablated. The ablated sample aerosol is introduced to an ICP-MS (ELAN 6000). The great advantages of the new technique in comparison to solution analysis are the high spatial resolution, the fast analysis of total element content (soluble and insoluble components) and a reduced risk of contamination. A cryogenic sample chamber (CRYOLACTM) enables the element determination in ice directly from the solid (frozen) state. A procedure was developed to analyse up to 39 elements (traces: Mg, Al, Fe, Zn, Cd, Pb and some rare earth elements; minor constituents: Ca and Na) in ice samples from Greenland with a previously not achieved spatial resolution of 4 mm along the core axis. This resolution is helpful to detect seasonal variations of element concentration in thin annual layers of deep-ice. We report operating conditions and analytical performance of the experimental set up, the improvement of signal stability by 17 OH internal standardisation and applying of a desolvation unit. Calibration of the system was performed with frozen multielement standard solutions along a special preparation procedure. Detection limits for the tracers Na, Mg (sea salt), Al (mineral dust) and Zn (anthropogenic source) are between 0. 1 - 1 µgkg- 1. Best detection limits in the range of 0. 001 - 0. 01 µgkg- 1 were reached for Co, Pb and all rare earth elements. Due to interferences, the element Ca could not be analysed at trace levels. To validate the method, <b>frozen</b> standard <b>reference</b> materials were measured. The recovery is about ± 10 %. Greenland ice core samples from different ages were analysed with the new technique. The results were compared with values from solution analysis, available published data and the particle content. The high spatial resolved analysis show strong inhomogeneous element concentrations along the core axis due to seasonal variations of element deposition. The data from solution analysis (solution ICP-MS and ion chromatography) are in a good agreement for many determined elements.

40|$|AbstractOur {{objectives}} were {{to develop a}} method to produce milk somatic cell count (SCC) reference materials for calibration of electronic somatic cell count (ESCC) using gravity separation and {{to determine the effect}} of refrigerated storage (4 °C) and freeze-thaw stability of the skim and whole milk SCC reference materials. Whole raw milk was high-temperature short-time pasteurized and split into 2 portions. One portion was gravity separated at 4 °C for 22 h and the second portion was centrifugally separated to produce skim milk that was also gravity separated with somatic cells rising to the surface. After 22 h, stock solutions (low SCC skim milk, high SCC skim milk, high SCC whole milk) were prepared and preserved (bronopol). Two experiments were conducted, one to compare the shelf-life of skim and whole milk SCC standards at 4 °C and one to determine the effect of freezing and thawing on SCC standards. Both experiments were replicated 3 times. Gravity separation was an effective approach to isolate and concentrate somatic cells from bovine milk and redistribute them in a skim or whole milk matrix to create a set of reference materials with a wider and more uniformly distributed range of SCC than current calibration sets. The liquid SCC reference materials stored using the common industry practice at 4 °C were stable (i. e., fit for purpose, no large decrease in SCC) for a 2 -wk period, whereas <b>frozen</b> and thawed <b>reference</b> materials may have a much longer useful life. A gradual decrease occurred in residual difference in ESCC (SCC × 1, 000 /mL) versus original assigned reference SCC over duration of refrigerated storage for both skim and whole milk SCC samples, indicating that milk ESCC of the preserved milks was gradually decreasing during 28 d of storage at 4 °C by about 15, 000 SCC/mL. No difference in the ESCC for skim milk was detected between refrigerated and frozen storage, whereas for whole milk the ESCC for frozen was lower than refrigerated samples. Future work is needed to determine the time and temperature of longer term frozen storage over which the SCC results are stable...|$|R
