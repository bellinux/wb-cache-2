The incubation {{was carried out}} in a 1, 4 -piperazinediethanesulfonic acid (PIPES) -buffered medium, without PO 34 – at circumneutral pH. Iron reduction was measured as a function of time (as determined by 0. 5 N HCl extraction), and solids were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron microscopy, and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The biogenic reduction of Fe 3 +was rapid; with 60 % of the total Fe (FeTOT) reduced in one day. Only an additional 10 % of FeTOT was reduced over the next three years. A fine-grained (~ 10 nm), cation-excess (CE) magnetite with an Fe 2 +/FeTOT ratio of 0. 5 – 0. 6 was the sole biogenic product after one day of incubation. The CE magnetite was unstable and partially transformed to micrometer-sized <b>ferrous</b> hydroxy <b>carbonate</b> [FHC; Fe 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 (s) ], a rosasite-type mineral, with time. <b>Ferrous</b> hydroxy <b>carbonate</b> dominated the mineral composition of the three year incubated sample.

40|$|Thermodynamic {{calculations}} of metastable equilibria {{were used to}} evaluate the potential for abiotic synthesis of aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the martian meteorite Allan Hills (ALH) 84001. The calculations show that PAHs and normal alkanes could form metastably from CO, CO 2, and H 2 below approximately 250 - 300 degrees C during rapid cooling of trapped magmatic or impact-generated gases. Depending on temperature, bulk composition, and oxidation-reduction conditions, PAHs and normal alkanes can form simultaneously or separately. Moreover, PAHs can form at lower H/C ratios, higher CO/CO 2 ratios, and higher temperatures than normal alkanes. Dry conditions with H/C ratios less than approximately 0. 01 - 0. 001 together with high CO/CO 2 ratios also favor the formation of unalkylated PAHs. The observed abundance of PAHs, their low alkylation, and a variable but high aromatic to aliphatic ratio in ALH 84001 all correspond to low H/C and high CO/CO 2 ratios in magmatic and impact gases and can be used to deduce spatial variations of these ratios. Some hydrocarbons could have been formed from trapped magmatic gases, especially if the cooling was fast enough to prevent reequilibration. We propose that subsequent impact heating(s) in ALH 84001 could have led to dissociation of <b>ferrous</b> <b>carbonates</b> to yield fine-grain magnetite, formation of a CO-rich local gas phase, reduction of water vapor to H 2, reequilibration of the trapped magmatic gases, aromatization of hydrocarbons formed previously, and overprinting of the synthesis from magmatic gases, if any.

The Transvaal BIF sequence contains at its upper stratigraphic part, an intriguing interlayered BIF-Mn association, namely the Hotazel Formation in the Kalahari Manganese Field, which constitutes the largest land-based manganese deposit on record. The genesis of the Hotazel deposits, and their exact significance in terms of atmosphere-hydrosphere-biosphere evolution, remain as elusive as they are challenging. In this thesis, an attempt is made to illuminate the origin and diagenesis of the Hotazel Formation and its post-depositional hydrothermal modification, through a highresolution geochemical study of the narrowest of the three BIF-Mn sedimentary cycles present in the Hotazel stratigraphy. This approach is coupled with a preliminary geochemical study of the distribution of Mn in older BIF of the Transvaal Supergroup as well (Kuruman and Griquatown Formations), so as to test recent models that causally link all BIFs in the Transvaal Supergroup under a common and evolving palaeo-environment of deposition. The results indicate that the cyclic deposition of the Hotazel BIF and enveloped Mn-rich sediments would have taken place in a stratified basin with a well-developed chemocline in terms of the vertical distributions of Mn and Fe, much like recent anoxic stratified basins such as the Orca Basin in the Gulf of Mexico. The increased Mn abundances as Mn-bearing <b>ferrous</b> <b>carbonates</b> in {{the upper part of the}} Griquatown BIF predating the Hotazel strata, also seems to lend support to the notion that the two BIFs are temporally interlinked as part of a broader sedimentary continuum. Finally, the largely conservative behaviour of Mn and associated elements during hydrothermal alteration of the Hotazel rocks is re-assessed, and renewed emphasis is placed on the possibility that brine metasomatism may have been a key factor in Mn redistribution and residual enrichment...|$|R

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{composition and}} the carbon isotope signature of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) and indicate that SOM is predominantly derived from higher land plants in sediments of both terrestrial as marine origins. The reactivity of SOM in the aquifer sediments studied {{is determined by}} the extent of molecular SOM degradation. Although all SOM studied has been degraded extensively from its biological precursor, the presence of relatively preserved lignin-derived components represents the least degraded status of SOM. Interestingly, the preservation of SOM is not inversely related to the age of the aquifer sediments. Instead, SOM present in sediments of a marine origin was more preserved and more reactive than SOM in their fluvial and fluvio-glacial counterparts. The more frequent exposure to atmospheric oxygen of sediments in the highly dynamic terrestrial depositional environments probably explains this difference. As a result, SOM in terrestrial sediments suffers from more intense, aerobic degradation. Similarly, fluvio-glacial erosion result in the re-exposure of sediments to oxygen. Besides SOM, pyrite and <b>ferrous</b> iron bearing <b>carbonates</b> were the most reactive sedimentary reductants found. The importance of these other reductants also strongly depend on sediment history (depositional environment, diagenetic processes and (palaeo) hydrological conditions) as well as the relative preservation of SOM. Locally, the exfiltration of anoxic groundwater is likely responsible for the precipitation an important reactive <b>ferrous</b> iron bearing <b>carbonate</b> phase. Acid conditions inhibited the microbial degradation of SOM while, under circum-neutral pH conditions, the reactivity of pyrite decreased due to the formation of ironhydroxide coatings on its surface. In contrast with oxygen reduction, microbial adaptation to nitrate exposure controlled the rates and pathway of nitrate reduction. In addition, results indicate that SOM oxidation was favored over pyrite oxidation during nitrate reduction under carbonate buffered conditions...|$|R

The temperature dependent precipitation kinetics of <b>ferrous</b> <b>carbonate</b> were studied using a powerful new "temperature ramped" approach. Activation energies calculated using three second order and two first order precipitation models (53. 8 - 123 kJ/mol) all qualitatively indicate that precipitation is controlled by surface reaction rate.

Surface reaction rate equations must, therefore, be used to model low temperature precipitation, and mass transfer equations should be used to estimate high temperature FeCO 3 growth. Seed crystals were prepared and Ostwald ripened in a reactor under anoxic conditions. Precipitation was induced by linearly increasing (ramping) the temperature and recording the change in iron concentration with respect to time and temperature. Rather than performing a series of isothermal experiments, temperature dependent kinetics were determined by fitting nonlinear models to temperature ramped experiments.

Iron ores occur at three distinct positions in the Penge Iron Formation (i) basal ore bodies located immediately above a thin oxidised shale unit that marks {{the base of the}} Penge Iron Formation in the Thabazimbi area and that may be interpreted as a structural contact towards the underlying dolostones of the Malmani Subgroup; (ii) ore bodies developed immediately above a prominent mafic sill in the Penge Iron Formation; (iii) small, lenticular ore bodies developed in the iron-formation without apparent structural control. Ore bodies in all three stratigraphic positions formed on the expense of the Penge Iron Formation protore, they share very similar mineralogical and textural attributes and can be subdivided into three major ore types with respect to their mineralogy and physical characteristics, namely, (a) carbonate-hematite ore; (b) hard hematite ore; (c) supergene modified ore. Further subdivision into subtypes is possible based on textural attributes. The first stage of iron ore formation at the Thabazimbi deposit is marked by oxidation of <b>ferrous</b> minerals (<b>carbonates</b> and grunerite) and their replacement by hematite. Efficient leaching and replacement of chert in the iron-formation to produce high-grade hematite ores characterizes the second stage of alteration. Stable isotope and fluid inclusion evidence point to a hydrothermal origin of the iron ores. Two hydrothermal fluids were identified, namely a highly saline Ca-Mg-rich brine (S = 27 wt% NaClequiv, TH = 160 ºC) and a Nadominated fluid of intermediate salinity (S = 10 wt% NaClequiv, TH = 130 ºC) that is possibly of meteoric origin. The results obtained in this study are used to propose the following sequence of mineralising events for the Thabazimbi iron ore deposit: (i) Deposition of iron-formation and diagenesis; (ii) contact metamorphic alteration related to the intrusion of the Bushveld igneous complex; (iii) metasomatic oxidation, leaching and residual upgrading that is tentatively linked to structurallycontrolled hydrothermal fluid flow; (iv) supergene modification of existing high-grade ore bodies in post-Gondwana times along the old African land surface...|$|R

Therefore, it was suggested that the lack of H 2 generation is due to the direct incorporation of <b>ferrous</b> iron into <b>carbonate</b> minerals without its oxidation during the hydrothermal alteration. In our experiments, although a large difference in the composition of serpentine and smectite/chlorite mixture was not identified between Exp- 250 and Exp- 350, the Fe content of dolomite in Exp- 250 (3 – 9  wt.% FeOtotal) was clearly higher than that of calcite in Exp- 350 (Table  3). The amount of generated magnetite in Exp- 350 was greater than that in Exp- 250. These data suggest that the amount of ferrous iron incorporated into the carbonate mineral strongly affected the extent of magnetite formation and resulting hydrogen generation in the fluid. Although such a trend in the effect of CO 2 on H 2 generation has been reported in some previous experiments at temperatures below 230  °C (Jones et al. 2010; Klein and McCollom 2013; Neubeck et al. 2014), our experiments show that the suppression of H 2 generation by the presence of CO 2 in the system occurs even at higher temperatures (250  °C) and in the CO 2 -H 2 O-komatiite system. In addition, a small amount of ferrous iron incorporated into calcite (up to 0.8  wt.%) may have also slightly suppressed magnetite formation in Exp- 350.|$|R

The scope of our work was to evaluate the ability of iron-reducing bacteria to transform iron ore and to identify the nature and outcome of the reduced phases. For this purpose, Lothringen (minette), the oolitic iron ore type found in the Lorraine area (North-East of France), was incubated with Shewanella putrefaciens CIP 80. 40 as a model iron-reducing bacteria. Chemical and mineralogical analyses (ferrozine assay, X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, Mossbauer spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy) were performed on both aged (i. e. iron ore oxidized by air during similar to 80 years of mining exploitation) and intact iron ores, before and after bioreduction in anoxic conditions. The oolites of intact iron ore were composed of goethite (alpha-FeOOH), with siderite (FeCO 3) and phyllosilicates as cement. Oolites of the aged iron ore contained hematite (alpha-Fe 2 O 3), as well as goethite and significantly less siderite. We observed that 26 % and 20 % of goethite was bio-reduced for aged and intact iron ore respectively. No other Fe(III) phase was significantly reduced. Natural iron oxides constituting the iron ore can now be considered more available for iron-reducing bacteria than chemically synthesized oxides. The nano-crystallinity of iron ore goethite and the presence of sorption sites for Fe(II) were suggested as explanations for this discrepancy. Finally, a poorly crystalline <b>ferrous</b> <b>carbonate</b> was the main Fe(II) phase formed during the bio-reduction process of the iron ore (aged and intact). In the context of iron mines, the neo-formed <b>ferrous</b> <b>carbonate</b> could be a precursor of siderite and could recreate the diagenetic links and the inter-oolitic cohesion lost by the iron ore during its oxidizing process. The long-term stability of iron ore pillars would therefore be ensured...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ferrous</b> <b>carbonate</b> {{has been}} studied in batch {{reactions}} under rigorously anoxic conditions to determine thermodynamic and kinetic information about the compound. This information is particularly of interest in corrosion control and in the comparison of FeCO 3 to CaCO 3, a compound which {{has been studied}} extensively. The enthalpy of the dissolution reaction has been calculated to be - 22. 8 ± 0. 6 kJ/mole, which {{is close to the}} NBS (1) reported value. The precipitation kinetics fit an empirical second order rate law with an activation energy of (9. 31 ± 1. 47) × 104 J/mole, indicating surface reaction control. The dissolution kinetics fit an empirical second order rate law more closely than a first order rate law; however, {{more research is needed to}} decisively determine the reaction order. With either rate law, the activation energy for dissolution is large enough to suggest surface reaction control...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of iron with dilute, aqueous acetic acid was studied {{in a closed}} system with a nitrogen atmosphere at 34 ~ The solution was sprayed on the metal continu-ously for periods up to 24 hr. The extent of reaction, determined gravimetrical ly, {{was found to be}} directly proport ional to exposure time. The reaction rate was a function of acidity, flow rate, gaseous atmosphere composition, temperature, and nature of the adherent reaction products. Total act iv i ty and type of local act iv ity changed with ex-posure conditions. This can be explained in terms of the defect structure of the film on the metal. Ident i ty and properties of the films check with those described by others. I t was concluded that ferrous acetate, <b>ferrous</b> <b>carbonate,</b> monobasic ferric acetate, and dibasic ferric acetate protect the underlying metal when formed as adherent, continu-ous fihns on the surface...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{polarographic}} {{measurements of}} sulfide and ferrous iron {{concentrations in the}} hypolimnion of a thermally stratified lake show that the inorganic chemistry in the waters nearest the sediment is dominated by ferrous sulfide precipitation. There is no evidence for supersaturation or organic interactions. The solubility product for ferrous sulfide at 10 °C and near zero ionic strength was 0. 9 - 2. 0 * 10 - ” M 2, which agrees with an independent laboratory determination for fine-grained freshly precipitated FeS. Although the solution concentrations of iron II and carbonate suggest that <b>ferrous</b> <b>carbonate</b> precipitation may just be possible, analysis of the particulate matter gave no evidence for this. In dcoxygenatcd hypolimnetic condi-tions the simultaneous presence of iron II and sulfide is likely because these are the preferred oxidation states at low re-dox potentials. Such a situation is de-scribed by Hutchinson (1957) as a fourt...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{corrosion}} {{behavior of}} commonly-used steels in the oil-containing and alcoholic sewage from gas field was studied combined with polarization curves, electric impedance spectrum (EIS), dynamic corrosion weight loss test, {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM) and energy spectrum (ES) of corrosion products. It was shown that corrosion rate increased with the sequence of 316 L, 16 Mn, 20 #, L 360 and 20 R steels, and 316 L steel was corroded more slightly than 16 Mn, 20 #, L 360 and 20 R steels. There were some spot corrosion pits {{on the surface of}} L 360 and 20 R steels. A higher Chromium content of 316 L steel led to a stronger corrosion resistance. <b>Ferrous</b> <b>carbonate</b> was the mainly corrosion product {{on the surface of the}} four steels. While the corrosion product on the surface of L 360 and 20 R steels was poor adhered and easy to fall off, and formed some corrosion pits on the steels surface...|$|E
40|$|Formation (Makhtesh Ramon, Israel) contain {{hexagonal}} p ates and cube-like bodies {{up to one}} millimeter across. Analyses by electron microscopy, infrared and Mrssbauer spectroscopy, and X-ray powder dif-fraction {{indicate that}} the matrix contains Fe-rich anhedral kaolinite, up to 100 /zm in size; the hexagonal plates are composed of euhedral, Fe-free kaolinite covered with well-developed acicular goethite and platy hematite (0. 5 to 2 /zm in size), and the cubes consist of fine-grained goethite with minor amounts ofkaolinite. The anhedral kaolinite appears to be detrital, the hexagonal p ates to be authigenic, and the cubes to be pseudomorphs after pyrite. Oxidation appears to have altered Fe-rich kaolinite and pyrite to Fe-free ka-olinite, goethite, and hematite and was accompanied by recrystallization a d pseudomorphic replacement. The alteration process was slow and was probably induced by a small increase in pH and in the Al/Fe ratio, resulting from oxidation of reduced components (pyrite, <b>ferrous</b> <b>carbonate,</b> organic matter) in a semiclosed, sediment-mud system. Overlying kaolinitic flint clay deposits may be the final product of a similar process...|$|E
