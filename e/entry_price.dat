5|$|Coastal erosion {{remained}} a problem. By {{the middle of}} the century, the tides had reached the southern edge of the castle, and a 1866 report stated that the walls had been undermined by the sea. Despite protective piles being driven around the castle, it was badly affected by flooding in 1875 and 1878, creating serious fissures in the stonework. The high costs of maintaining the property, combined with its dwindling utility, encouraged the government to sell the castle to the South Eastern Railway company in 1888, who intended {{to turn it into a}} railway station. It was then sold to private owners and a small museum was created in the castle, which was sometimes opened to the public for an <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> of one penny.|$|E

Mossberg also called the price [...] "modest" [...] for a device of its capabilities, and praised the ten-hour battery life. Others, including PC Advisor and the Sydney Morning Herald, wrote that the iPad would also compete with proliferating netbooks, most of which use Microsoft Windows.

The reviewer Andy Gill commented, [...] "For all the multitude of crotches spread about the stage, this is as unenticing as pop gets, utterly lifeless despite the fervent activity." [...] Mayer Nissim from Digital Spy felt that [...] "Despite its absurd charm, this CD won't provoke the rediscovery of Hard Candy {{that it seems to}} nudge towards. That said, it's still an entertaining blast from start to finish.

40|$|The {{rising prices}} of {{pharmaceuticals}} have generated considerable, and often acrimonious, debate. Yet, {{there is little}} theoretical work or empirical evidence on pharmaceutical entry-pricing strategies or on the time paths of the prices of new entrants versus incumbents. This study explores the <b>entry</b> <b>pricing</b> strategies of pharmaceutical manufacturers. Previous theoretical models have considered a “price skimming ” strategy, with drugs entering the market at a premier relative to incumbents or a “market penetration ” strategy, pricing the drug at a discount {{in the hope of}} gaining market share. The selection of appropriate strategy depends upon the degree of product differentiation and/or the nature of repeat purchase arrangements. However, these investigations have not examined the implications of product quality for <b>entry</b> <b>pricing</b> and pricing dynamics. The present study provides a model that demonstrates the interplay between quality and product differentiation in determining the optimal pricing strategy. In particular, higher (lower) quality products will engage in price skimming (market penetration) strategies in markets where products are sufficiently differentiated, but will choose a market penetration (price skimming) strategy in markets that are less differentiated. The reason is that in less differentiated markets, price competition is mor...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{calculated}} {{the value of}} the preference margin granted to Euro-Mediterranean partners in the cases of reduced <b>entry</b> <b>prices</b> in force, and then it has been simulated the impact of EU trade liberalisation for F&V on such values after two different alternatives of EP system variations resulting from a WTO agreement. The results of current preferences indicate that in monetary terms there is only a significant relevance of the preferential EPs in the case of Moroccan tomatoes and, to a lesser extent, in Moroccan clementines. Very little is the relevance for Jordanian tomatoes and cucumbers and Moroccan courgettes, cucumbers and artichokes. In the cases of oranges from Egypt, Morocco, Israel and Jordan, preferential EP has not meant potential monetary transfers to these preference-receiver countries. Instead, the ad valorem tariff exoneration seems crucial in almost all the products. With regard to the erosion of preferences {{as a result of a}} WTO agreement, the magnitude of the erosion depends crucially on the variation/no-variation of the current trigger EPs, and the undermining of preferences is concentrated mostly on Moroccan tomatoes. <b>Entry</b> <b>prices,</b> erosion of trade preferences, Euro-Mediterranean trade, fruits and vegetables, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
