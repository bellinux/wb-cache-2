40|$|Background: During female {{reproductive}} cycles, a rapid fall in circulating progesterone (P 4) {{levels is}} one of the earliest events that occur during induced luteolysis in mammals. In rodents, it is well recognized that during luteolysis, P 4 is catabolized to its inactive metabolite, 20 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (20 alpha-OHP) by the action of 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20 alpha-HSD) enzyme and involves transcription factor, Nur 77. Studies have been carried out to examine expression of 20 alpha-HSD and its activity in the corpus luteum (CL) of <b>buffalo</b> <b>cow.</b> Methods: The expression of 20 alpha-HSD across different bovine tissues along with CL was examined by qPCR analysis. Circulating P 4 levels were monitored before and during PGF 2 alpha treatment. Expression of 20 alpha-HSD and Nur 77 mRNA was determined in CL at different time points post PGF 2 alpha treatment in <b>buffalo</b> <b>cows.</b> The chromatographic separation of P 4 and its metabolite, 20 alpha-OHP, in rat and <b>buffalo</b> <b>cow</b> serum samples were performed on reverse phase HPLC system. To further support the findings, 20 alpha-HSD enzyme activity was quantitated in cytosolic fraction of CL of both rat and <b>buffalo</b> <b>cow.</b> Results: Circulating P 4 concentration declined rapidly in response to PGF 2 alpha treatment. HPLC analysis of serum samples did not reveal changes in circulating 20 alpha-OHP levels in <b>buffalo</b> <b>cows</b> but serum from pseudo pregnant rats receiving PGF 2 alpha treatment showed an increased 20 alpha-OHP level at 24 h post treatment with accompanying decrease in P 4 concentration. qPCR expression of 20 alpha-HSD in CL from control and PGF 2 alpha-treated <b>buffalo</b> <b>cows</b> showed higher expression at 3 and 18 h post treatment, but its specific activity was not altered at different time points post PGF 2 alpha treatment. The Nur 77 expression increased several fold 3 h post PGF 2 alpha treatment similar to the increased expression observed in the PGF 2 alpha-treated pseudo pregnant rats which perhaps suggest initiation of activation of apoptotic pathways in response to PGF 2 alpha treatment. Conclusions: The results taken together suggest that synthesis of P 4 appears to be primarily affected by PGF 2 alpha treatment in <b>buffalo</b> <b>cows</b> in contrast to increased metabolism of P 4 in rodents...|$|R
