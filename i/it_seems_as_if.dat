5|$|After {{a lengthy}} time, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{the dog is}} cured, in {{that he is now}} {{friendly}} towards Keys. Julie confronts the dog's original owner, who has come to claim him, and who presumably trained him to attack black people. She angrily tells him in front of his grandchildren, who only know the dog as a loving family pet, that the dog has been cured by a black man.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to copying and restoring portraits, the serjeant-painters also undertook decorative tasks, {{such as the}} painting of banners and stage scenery. Parchment rolls of the Office of the Works record that De Critz oversaw the decorating of royal houses and palaces. Since Peake’s work is not recorded there, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> De Critz took responsibility for the more decorative tasks, while Peake continued {{his work as a}} royal portrait painter. However, Peake and Paul Isackson painted the cabins, carvings, and armorials on the ship the Prince Royal in 1611.|$|E

5|$|A modern {{review was}} given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan. Buchanan recognizes that the film's acting was commended for its action and {{highlights}} the acting of the fool, placed prominently in the foreground, and says that <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he has been imported from King Lear. This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy for the audience and filters a set of responses for the audience {{and goes on to}} steal the reunion scene with his expressions. Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for audiences to intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E
5|$|Half-Life 2 {{picks up}} the story, in which the G-Man takes Freeman out of stasis and inserts him on a train en route to City 17 an {{indeterminate}} number of years after {{the events of the}} first game, with Earth now enslaved by the transhuman forces of the Combine. The player guides Gordon to aid in humanity's struggle against the Combine and its human representative, Dr. Wallace Breen. He oversees the occupation from his base of operations in the Citadel, a monolithic building at the heart of City17. Fighting alongside Gordon is an underground resistance led by former colleague Dr. Eli Vance, as well other allies including Dr. Vance's daughter Alyx Vance and the enigmatic Vortigaunts, an alien species. Half-Life 2 ends with a climactic battle atop the Citadel that inflicts critical damage to its dark fusion reactor. When <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Alyx and Gordon are to be engulfed by the explosion, the G-Man appears once more. After giving a cryptic speech, he extracts Gordon from danger and places him in stasis once again.|$|E
25|$|In 1590 when Aodh Ruadh Ó Domhnaill (Red Hugh O'Donnell) {{was held}} in Dublin Castle, his half-brother, Domhnall, {{attempted}} to wrest Tír Conaill from his father Aodh. Aodh Ruadh's mother in response mustered a large force of Scots and also the Mac Suibhne branches of Na Tuatha and Fanad to oppose Domhnall. During this time Donnchadh. lord of Banagh took Domhnall's side, along with Ó Baoighill. The opposing forces met near Glencolumbkille, in September 1590, and Domhnall's force was defeated. By 1592 Aodh Ruadh was in power of Tír Conaill and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Donnchadh was pardoned for opposing him, as Donnchadh was present at Aodh Ruadh's inauguration at Kilmacrenan.|$|E

The upgrades Include the new fire control system Fotona EFCS-3B (with laser rangefinder, cross-wind sensor, ballistic computer and gunner's passive night vision device), a 105mm tank gun, side skirts, smoke grenade launchers, ERA package, a new power-pack with 780hp 12-cylinder V-46-6 diesel engine and new tracks.

25|$|In {{numerous}} {{cases in}} both the 1794 print and the 1795 print, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the acid has eaten away {{too much of the}} relief, and Blake has had to go over sections with ink and wash, often touching the text and design outlines with pen. This ink and wash work may have been executed in 1818, along with the addition of the frame lines, although this cannot be ascertained for certain. Several of the plates also bear evidence of rudimentary colour printing, a method with which Blake was experimenting in the 1790s, and these plates may represent his first attempts at this technique (whereby he used coloured inks to print rather than black). Several of the plates also feature examples of white line engraving, a technique where Blake would literally cut into the stop-out to create tiny furrows, which would be eaten away by the acid, creating a streak effect in the final print.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Led Zeppelin II was not positive originally. John Mendelsohn wrote a negative {{review of the}} record for Rolling Stone, in which he mocked the group's heavy sound and white blues, while writing that [...] "until you've listened to the album eight hundred times, as I have, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it's just one especially heavy song extended over the space of two whole sides". Robert Christgau jokingly referred to the band as [...] "the best of the wah-wah [...] groups, so dirty they drool on demand", while complaining that [...] "all the songs sound alike". He nonetheless conceded that [...] "Led Zeppelin simply out-heavied everyone" [...] in 1969, [...] "pitting Jimmy Page's repeated low-register fuzz riffs against the untiring freak intensity of Robert Plant's vocal. This trademark has only emerged clearly on the second album, {{and more and more}} I am coming to understand it as an artistic triumph." ...|$|E

The [...] "great and powerful Oz" [...] is actually Herman Smith, a failed politician from Atlantic City, New Jersey, who was transported to Oz when a balloon he was flying to promote his campaign to become the city dogcatcher was lost in a storm. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion are distraught that they will never receive their respective brain, heart, and courage, but Dorothy makes them realize that they already have had these things all along. Just as <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she {{will never be able to}} get home, Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, appears and implores her to find her way home by searching within and using the magic of the silver slippers by clicking the heels together three times. After thanking Glinda and saying goodbye to her friends, she takes clicks her heels together three times. She is then back near home with Toto in her arms and walks into the apartment.|$|E
500|$|Commenting on the combat, Paprocki {{said that}} despite the {{simplified}} combo system, the developers have [...] "managed to infuse the sheer brutality and force God of War is known for {{within the confines of}} the [...] platform." [...] Because of the simplified system, situations which call for Kratos' magical abilities are rare. [...] However, if players do choose to use these abilities, selecting them is a [...] "burden in the haste of a battle", requiring players to cycle through their entire inventory. Paprocki also criticized the lack of an autosave feature, as the game does not save the player's position when receiving a phone call, which [...] "can lead to unbearable frustration." [...] Freeman said that the combination of the weapons and quick time events make the combat [...] "a convincing interpretation of the action in the original console games". Davis said that although there are puzzle and platforming elements, the focus is [...] "clearly on the combat" [...] and felt that the combat system was [...] "a little shallow". He said <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the abundance of enemies [...] "exist solely to act as punching (or slicing, as it were) bags for Kratos".|$|E
500|$|Parasakthi {{received}} critical acclaim. P. Balasubramania Mudaliar of Sunday Observer wrote, [...] "The {{story is}} simple {{but it has}} been made powerful by Mr. Karunanidhi by his beautiful dialogues. Mr. Shivaji Ganesan, who plays the main role dominates from the beginning to the end" [...] and concluded, [...] "If an Academy award were to be given to any picture, I have little doubt that this picture would be entitled on its merits to such an award." [...] Dinamani Kadir, a Tamil weekly owned by Indian Express Limited (then known as The Indian Express Group), carried an unusually long review of Parasakthi running into three closely printed pages. The review was given a cynical title, [...] "Kandarva Mandalam" [...] ("The Abode of Kandarvas") and it began with a small box-item which read, [...] "Parasakthi: This goddess is abused in a Tamil film with her name". The reviewer opined, [...] "The main aim of the film is to attach gods. Along with that, the government and society are overtly and covertly attacked. The embittered and agitated reviewer further claimed, [...] "He , acting as a mad man, threatens and beats the people on the street and grabs whatever they have and eats it. Then he goes to give repeatedly all those economics lectures, rationalist lectures and anti-god lectures. When we see the hero doing all that, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he is portraying the lives of those who are trying to force such ideas in the ...film." [...] For the reviewer, thus, the DMK men were living on others' sweat and preaching unacceptable subsersive ideas. The magazine Sivaji praised the dialogues written by Karunanidhi, and the performances of Ganesan and Sahasranamam.|$|E

500|$|Grey's Anatomy {{has been}} well {{received}} among critics. The show holds an average of 71% positive score on Rotten Tomatoes and 7.7/10 score at IMDB site. The A.V. Club gave an insight on both the overwhelming success and lows {{in the quality of}} the hit medical drama saying, [...] "The quality arc for the show is all over the place, starting with a steady build in the first season, then skyrocketing into phenomenon in season two, then leveling off and dipping in season three, before having some seriously bumpy moments in seasons four (interrupted by the writers’ strike) and five. The climb begins again in season six" [...] Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly in a review wrote, [...] " [...] I believe the show’s best season to date is season 2. Let me make it clear that I’m not saying seasons 3 through 9 were bad. In my opinion, there have only been a few lulls in the show’s history, and most of them didn’t last a full season." [...] adding, [...] "I still enjoy the show, and I’ll honestly never stop watching. By any standards, Grey’s Anatomy has been successful television, ranking highly in the ratings for nine seasons and entering the cultural lexicon via phrases as cloying yet catchy as [...] "McDreamy.", the show has had its periods of being intensely irritating, and it has had its periods when <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Shonda Rhimes has taken leave of her faculties, but it’s also got an amazingly high batting average, particularly with every solid season that passes along in this second act of its run." [...] The site lauded the show saying, [...] "On average, it’s been very good TV, filled with interesting, driven characters who run the gamut of professions within the show’s hospital setting. It’s been, by turns, a good soap, a good romantic comedy, a good medical drama, and a good interpersonal show about an unexpected workplace family." ...|$|E
2500|$|The couplet sums {{up with a}} {{potential}} answer {{to all of the}} questions that the author was posing throughout the entire sonnet. He says, [...] "thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee" [...] in the first line of the couplet. This is suggesting that the young man has valuable attraction that is not being used properly or appreciated. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the speaker is insinuating that the beauty will die with the young man. The last line of the couplet says, [...] "which usèd, lives th'executor to be." [...] Here <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the speaker is saying that if the young man uses his beauty, then it will prolong his life. The word [...] "executor" [...] hints at both death and accounting.|$|E
