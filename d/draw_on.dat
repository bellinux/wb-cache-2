5|$|As social centres castles were {{important}} places for display. Builders {{took the opportunity}} to <b>draw</b> <b>on</b> symbolism, through the use of motifs, to evoke a sense of chivalry that was aspired to in the Middle Ages amongst the elite. Later structures of the Romantic Revival would <b>draw</b> <b>on</b> elements of castle architecture such as battlements for the same purpose. Castles have been compared with cathedrals as objects of architectural pride, and some castles incorporated gardens as ornamental features. The right to crenellate, when granted by a monarch– though it was not always necessary– was important not just as it allowed a lord to defend his property but because crenellations and other accoutrements associated with castles were prestigious through their use by the elite. Licences to crenellate were also proof of a relationship with or favour from the monarch, who was the one responsible for granting permission.|$|E

5|$|Because he {{persistently}} programmed {{works that}} did not attract the public, Beecham's musical activities at this time consistently lost money. As {{a result of his}} estrangement from his father between 1899 and 1909, his access to the Beecham family fortune was strictly limited. From 1907 he had an annuity of £700 left to him in his grandfather's will, and his mother subsidised some of his loss-making concerts, {{but it was not until}} father and son were reconciled in 1909 that Beecham was able to <b>draw</b> <b>on</b> the family fortune to promote opera.|$|E
5|$|Both {{farmers and}} {{scientists}} must continually <b>draw</b> <b>on</b> the irreplaceable resource of genetic diversity to ensure productive harvests. While genetic variability provides farmers with plants {{that have a}} higher resilience to pests and diseases and allows scientists access to a more diverse genome than {{can be found in}} highly selected crops. The breeding of monocultural crops steadily reduces genetic diversity as desirable traits are selected, and undesirable traits are removed. Farmers can increase within-crop diversity to some extent by planting mixtures of crop varieties; they can further increase in-field diversity by polycultural practices such as intercropping and companion planting.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{no history}} of radio {{programming}} or stable of radio stars to <b>draw</b> <b>on</b> and perennial cash shortages, DuMont was an innovative and creative network.

5|$|DuMont {{programs}} were by necessity low-budget affairs, {{and the network}} received relatively few awards from the TV industry.
