5|$|Many rivers {{originating}} in mountainous or high-latitude regions receive {{a significant portion}} of their flow from snowmelt. This often makes the river's flow <b>highly</b> <b>seasonal</b> resulting in periodic flooding during the spring months and at least in dry mountainous regions like the mountain West of the US or most of Iran and Afghanistan, very low flow {{for the rest of the}} year. In contrast, if much of the melt is from glaciated or nearly glaciated areas, the melt continues through the warm season, with peak flows occurring in mid to late summer.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{nowadays}} {{sparsely populated}} {{as the result}} of urbanization after World War II. Many of the dwellings now remain shut, while abandonment of the traditional rural economy has affected the cultural landscape. Epirus, of which Vikos–Aoös is part, {{is considered one of the}} most underdeveloped regions in Greece. Tourism constitutes the principal source of revenue for the local economy, although it has a <b>highly</b> <b>seasonal</b> character. Intense development in terms of accommodation and tourism infrastructure occurred in the 1980s, mainly through state initiatives.|$|E
5|$|Due to Madagascar's <b>highly</b> <b>seasonal</b> climate, lemur {{evolution}} {{has produced a}} level of species diversity rivaling {{that of any other}} primate group. Until shortly after humans arrived on the island around 2,000years ago, there were lemurs as large as a male gorilla. Today, there are nearly 100 species of lemurs, and most of those species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur taxonomic classification is controversial and depends on which species concept is used. Even the higher-level taxonomy is disputed, with some experts preferring to place most lemurs within the infraorder Lemuriformes, while others prefer Lemuriformes to contain all living strepsirrhines, placing all lemurs in the superfamily Lemuroidea and all lorises and galagos in the superfamily Lorisoidea.|$|E
50|$|Westminster lies in {{the humid}} {{subtropical}} climate zone, with hot and humid summers and cool winters with <b>highly</b> variable <b>seasonal</b> snowfall. Due to its elevation, distance from the Chesapeake Bay and urban heat island, temperatures in Westminster are often considerably lower than in Baltimore, especially at night.|$|R
50|$|Although it is a {{perennial}} river, the Matlabas is <b>highly</b> subject to <b>seasonal</b> variations, thus its runoff is very variable. Its main tributary is the Mamba River.|$|R

5|$|The Shishugou Formation {{represents}} {{a variety of}} depositional environments, including alluvial fans and alluvial plains, streams, wetlands, and shallow lakes. During the time when Limusaurus lived, the environment would have been consistently warm and dry, judging by the abundance of coal and carbon-rich deposits. The climate was probably <b>highly</b> <b>seasonal</b> due to monsoonal influences, with warm, wet summers and dry winters. The climate enabled {{the growth of a}} richly forested environment; the forest would have been dominated by Araucaria trees, with the undergrowth being occupied by Coniopteris tree ferns, Anglopteris and Osmunda ferns, Equisetites horsetails, and Elatocladus shrubs.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{trait that}} sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid {{primates}} is their long lifespan {{together with their}} high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a <b>highly</b> <b>seasonal</b> environment, which has affected their birthrate, maturation, and twinning rate (r-selection). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live {{twice as long as}} they do in the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. We now know that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging (senescence) and still be capable of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Except for the aye-aye and the Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, lemurs are {{seasonal}} breeders {{with very}} short mating and birth seasons {{influenced by the}} <b>highly</b> <b>seasonal</b> availability of resources in their environment. Mating seasons usually last {{less than three weeks}} each year, with the female vagina opening up only during a few hours or days of her most receptive time of estrus. These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to relate to their short gestation periods, rapid maturation, and low basal metabolic rates, as well as the high energy costs of reproduction for females. This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations—both unusual traits among primates. In both the aye-aye and Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, birth (parturition) occurs over a six-month period.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{measurements}} of the gorgonin and calcite within several long-lived species of gorgonians {{can be useful in}} paleoclimatology and paleoceanography, as the skeletal growth rate and composition of these species is <b>highly</b> correlated with <b>seasonal</b> and climatic variation.|$|R
50|$|The {{climate is}} sub-humid and semi-arid, with {{irregular}} rainfall, and occasional {{long periods of}} drought. The average annual rainfall is 1,074 mm, with a <b>highly</b> concentrated <b>seasonal</b> regime and badly distributed, with 85% of the rain falling in themonths of November to March, while 2% of the rain falls from May to August. During this period, that may include the months of September and October, the deficiency in the soils is deep and {{the waters of the}} rivers drop to critical levels.|$|R
50|$|Just {{like its}} neighbour, the Wimereux, but unlike most Pas-de-Calais waterways, the Liane {{exhibits}} <b>highly</b> marked <b>seasonal</b> fluctuations. High waters {{occur at the}} end of autumn and in winter, characterised by monthly mean flow rates between 3.06 and 5.33 m³/s, from November to March inclusive with a maximum in January. Low waters occur in summer, from June to September, with a decrease in monthly mean flow rate descending to 0.76 m³/s in August. However variations in flow rate are much more pronounced over short periods or from year to year.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} {{conserve}} {{energy and water}} in their <b>highly</b> <b>seasonal</b> environment, mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs exhibit seasonal behavioral cycles of dormancy where the metabolic rate and body temperature are lowered. They are the only primates known to do so. They accumulate fat reserves in their hind legs and the base of their tail before the dry winter season, when food and water are scarce, and can exhibit daily and prolonged torpor during the dry season. Daily torpor constitutes less than 24 hours of dormancy, whereas prolonged torpor averages two weeks in duration and signals hibernation. Mouse lemurs have been observed experiencing torpor that lasts for several consecutive days, but dwarf lemurs are known to hibernate for six to eight months every year, particularly {{on the west coast}} of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Northern {{parts of}} the country are {{characterized}} by hot, humid summers with mild, drier winters, and <b>highly</b> <b>seasonal</b> precipitation. Mesopotamia, located in northeast Argentina, has a subtropical climate with no dry season and is characterized by high temperatures and abundant rainfall because of exposure to moist easterly winds from the Atlantic Ocean throughout the year. The Chaco region in the center-north, despite being relatively homogeneous in terms of precipitation and temperature, is the warmest region in Argentina, {{and one of the few}} natural areas in the world located between tropical and temperate latitudes that is not a desert. Precipitation decreases from east to west in the Chaco region because eastern areas are more influenced by moist air from the Atlantic Ocean than the west, resulting in the vegetation transitioning from forests and marshes to shrubs. Northwest Argentina is predominantly dry, hot, and subtropical although its rugged topography results in a diverse climate.|$|E

50|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{measurements}} of the gorgonin and calcite within species of gorgonia {{can be useful in}} paleoclimatology and paleoceanography. Studies of the growth, composition, and structure of the skeleton of certain gorgonia species, (e.g., Primnoa resedaeformis, and Plexaurella dichotoma) can be <b>highly</b> correlated with <b>seasonal</b> and climatic variation.|$|R
5000|$|Nasi goreng dabai is rice stir-fried with dabai (canarium odontophyllum), an {{indigenous}} fruit {{found only in}} Sarawak. It is often compared to an olive, due to their similarity in appearance as well as taste.

5000|$|Australian {{winemaking}} {{results have}} been impressive and it has established benchmarks {{for a number of}} varietals, such as Chardonnay and Shiraz. Moreover, Australians have innovated in canopy management and other viticultural and in wine-making techniques, and they have a general attitude toward their work that sets them apart from producers in Europe. Australian wine-makers travel the wine world as <b>highly</b> skilled <b>seasonal</b> workers, relocating to the northern hemisphere during the off-season at home. They are an important resource in the globalisation of wine and wine critic Matt Kramer notes that [...] "the most powerful influence in wine today" [...] comes from Australia.|$|R
25|$|The {{traditional}} cuisine of Denmark, {{like that}} of the other Nordic countries and of Northern Germany, consists mainly of meat, fish and potatoes. Danish dishes are <b>highly</b> <b>seasonal,</b> stemming from the country's agricultural past, its geography, and its climate of long, cold winters.|$|E
25|$|Agricultural {{production}} in WA {{is a major}} contributor to the state and national economy.

40|$|Transportation service {{facilities}} often form system choke points with service rendered to entities from multiple queues that require staging for processing. With an MIP model that accommodates sequence-dependent setup times and processing times, we demonstrate how scheduling {{can be improved}} relative to simple rules that impose equity (such as FIFO) or efficiency (such as fastest processing time). Using an efficient heuristic scheduler for problems of this type, we then demonstrate, with simulation, the benefits that can occur from employing the refined scheduling procedure at a series of choke points in a transportation system subject to <b>highly</b> variable <b>seasonal</b> traffic.

40|$|The Epipalaeolithic of the Levant {{witnessed}} {{important changes}} in subsistence behaviour, foreshadowing {{the transition to}} sedentism and cultivation, but much less is known of contemporary developments in the Middle Nile Valley. Here, Affad 23, a 16000 -year-old settlement, {{on the margins of}} a resource-rich, multi-channel floodplain, offers exceptional insights. Unusually good preservation has left the remains of pits and postholes, indicating the construction of temporary shelters and specialised functional zones. The Affad 23 community successfully exploited a wide range of riverine resources, and created a <b>highly</b> organised <b>seasonal</b> camp adjacent to convenient, resource-rich hunting grounds. Surprisingly, they continued to exploit Levallois-like tools, rather than adopting the new technologies (e. g. microliths) that were then evolving in Upper Egypt...|$|R
40|$|People on the Indian {{sub-continent}} are not {{the only}} ones to rely on monsoon-induced changes. West Africa has <b>highly</b> variable <b>seasonal</b> rainfalls as well. Whether certain regions in West Africa will be exposed to major rainfall or near-drought conditions is largely determined by water temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Atlantic. A comprehensive oceanic and atmospheric measurement and modeling program at IFM-GEOMAR is aimed at improving the seasonal predictability of precipitation patterns in countries adjacent to the Gulf of Guinea and the northeastern regions of Brazil. This in turn might lead to early preventive measures in the fight against climate-related diseases, such as dengue fever, malaria, cholera, and meningitis, and might lead to an improved adaptation of agricultural usage to regional climate conditions...|$|R

25|$|Ever since logging {{of white}} pine {{began in the}} 1880s, timber has been an {{important}} industry. However, the stands of hemlock and hardwood went under-exploited until the mid-twentieth century as selection cutting was practiced in the western reaches of the forest.

40|$|The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics has {{a mandate}} to {{increase}} and stabilize the agricultural production of these areas. The region is characterised by a <b>highly</b> variablelow <b>seasonal</b> rainfall. A number of generalized climatic classification approaches have been reviewed; of these, the approach suggested by Troll to distinguish climates is important. The dry semi-arid tropics need to be mapped {{on the basis of}} the large volume of rainfall and evaporation data that is currently available. This paper points out that agroclimatic classification of the semi-arid tropics aims at addressing specific problems like risk to crops/cropping patterns, likelihood of intra- and inter-seasonal droughts, and adequacy of soil moisture in the seeding zone for dry seeding. The selection of criteria for each classification should be based on empirically derived parameter...|$|R

25|$|The {{hydrologic cycle}} in the Ganges basin {{is governed by}} the Southwest Monsoon. About 84% of the total {{rainfall}} occurs in the monsoon from June to September. Consequently, streamflow in the Ganges is <b>highly</b> <b>seasonal.</b> The average dry season to monsoon discharge ratio is about 1:6, as measured at Hardinge Bridge. This strong seasonal variation underlies many problems of land and water resource development in the region. The seasonality of flow is so acute it can cause both drought and floods. Bangladesh, in particular, frequently experiences drought {{during the dry season}} and regularly suffers extreme floods during the monsoon.|$|E
25|$|Perth {{receives}} moderate though <b>highly</b> <b>seasonal</b> rainfall, {{making it}} the fourth wettest Australian capital city after Darwin, Sydney and Brisbane. Summers are generally hot and dry, lasting from December to late March, with February generally being the hottest month of the year. Winters are relatively cool and wet, making Perth {{a classic example of}} a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa). Perth is a particularly sunny city for this type of climate; it has an average of 8.8 hours of sunshine per day, which equates to around 3200 hours of annual sunshine, and 138.7 clear days annually, {{making it the}} sunniest capital city in Australia.|$|E
25|$|During the Permian all the Earth's major land masses, except {{portions}} of East Asia, were collected {{into a single}} supercontinent known as Pangaea. Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (Panthalassa, the universal sea), and the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana. The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Tethys Ocean, an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era. Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold ("continental climate") and monsoon conditions with <b>highly</b> <b>seasonal</b> rainfall patterns.

40|$|We {{measured}} ecosystem CO 2 fluxes for an alpine shrubland on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau, Qinghai, China. The {{study is}} to understand (1) the seasonal variation of CO 2 flux and (2) how environmental factors affect the seasonality of CO 2 exchange in the alpine ecosystem. Daytime ecosystem respiration was extrapolated from the relationship between temperature and nighttime CO 2 fluxes under high turbulent conditions. Seasonal patterns of gross ecosystem production, ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem CO 2 exchange followed <b>highly</b> the <b>seasonal</b> change of aboveground biomass in the alpine shrubland. The net ecosystem CO 2 exchange was mainly controlled by the variation of photosynthetic photon flux density, while the ecosystem respiration was closely correlated to the soil temperature at 5 -cm depth. Integrated values of gross ecosystem production, ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem CO 2 exchange for the period from November 1, 2002 to October 31 2003 were estimated to be 1418, 1155 and 222 g CO 2 m(- 2) yr(- 1), respectively...|$|R
