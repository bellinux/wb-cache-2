5|$|The {{whole point}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> the song. The self {{is coming from}} a state of pure awareness, {{from the state of}} being. All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the {{physical}} world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and {{about the quality of the}} transcendent.|$|E
25|$|Pessimism bias is {{an effect}} {{in which people}} exaggerate the {{likelihood}} that negative things will happen to them. It contrasts with optimism bias. The difference <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in an improbable way worried about our society's future.|$|E
25|$|Other {{reviews of}} the book and audio-book were mixed. The {{reviewer}} in The New York Times mentioned (by way of criticism) that Sophocles and Freud had pursued the same idea that forms the book's focus, that <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> defined by our fears. Greil Marcus said Rakoff's stories are not as funny as those he read on the radio.|$|E

25|$|The most {{defining}} {{property of}} modernity, according to Giddens, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> disembedded from time and space. In pre-modern societies, space was {{the area in}} which one moved, time was the experience one had while moving. In modern societies, however, the social space is no longer confined by the boundaries set by the space in which one moves. One can now imagine what other spaces look like, even if he has never been there. In this regard, Giddens talks about virtual space and virtual time. Another distinctive property of modernity lies in the field of knowledge.|$|E
25|$|A {{feature that}} distinguishes humans from most animals <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not born with an {{extensive}} repertoire of behavioral programs {{that would enable}} us to survive on our own ("physiological prematurity"). To compensate for this, we have an unmatched ability to learn, i.e., to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration. Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised, these programs can become automated {{to the extent that}} their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness. Take, as an example, the incredible fine motor skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the sensorimotor coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road. Such complex behaviors are possible only because a sufficient number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control. In fact, the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs.|$|E

Mack, Davis {{said that many}} people expected him to support Mack, but they discovered that he was [...] "way on the other side". [...] Davis recounted that he had some great discussions with Mack; [...] "He was brilliant... he was wrong, {{but he was very}} good...

500|$|Swift did {{not want}} any misconceptions of Beautiful Eyes as her second album and {{therefore}} partnered with the American retail company Wal-Mart to make the EP an exclusive release. The album was only made available through American Wal-Mart stores and Wal-Mart's website. Furthermore, it was made a limited release because Swift only allowed Big Machine Records to manufacture {{a certain number of}} copies of the EP. She said, [...] "I’m only letting my record company make a small amount of these. The last thing I want any of you to think <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> putting out too many releases." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2006 it was {{announced}} that the population had reached 150 - a rise of more than 50 per cent since the 2002 buy-out. Willie McSporran, former chairman of the Heritage Trust, was quoted as saying: [...] "The trust turned 300 years of population decline on its head by encouraging new development and the growth of the local economy. A sign of the surge of people wanting to relocate to Gigha <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> struggling to meet the demand for housing despite building 18 new homes." [...] The issues of island ownership are not unique to Gigha and consequently the island has been highlighted in an edition of the BBC series, Countryfile.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the second}} season, Taylor decided to remove the Kazon as the series' primary antagonists, having found the effort to develop the alien species to be unsuccessful. She felt that they never grew into a {{compelling}} adversary, despite their appearances in multiple episodes. Taylor argued that the Kazon limited the potential of the series, saying: [...] "It created the curious implication that we are standing still in space, when our franchise <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going at incredible speeds toward the Alpha Quadrant – we keep running into the same people over and over again! It was just an oddity, and I don't think the Kazon have served us well." [...] While discussing their role in the future episodes, she explained that it was her [...] "intention to leave them behind and to find new and I hope more interesting aliens".|$|E
500|$|Family Guy {{has been}} {{cancelled}} twice, although strong fan support and DVD sales have caused Fox to reconsider. MacFarlane mentioned how these cancellations affected the lineup of writers each time Fox approved the show.

500|$|Gillard, as a Member of Parliament, {{voted against}} {{a bill that}} would have legalised {{same-sex}} marriage in Australia in 2011. In 2010 she stated [...] "the Marriage Act is appropriate in its current form, that is recognising that marriage is between a man and a woman" [...] and that marriage being between a man and woman [...] "has a special status". The triennial Labor conference held in December 2011 saw Gillard successfully negotiate an amendment on same-sex marriage to see the party introduce a conscience vote to parliament through a private member's bill, rather than a binding vote. When the private members bill was introduced by Labor backbencher Stephen Jones, it was defeated in the House of Representatives on 19 September 2012. In September 2014, Gillard said that the [...] "course of human history now <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to see same-sex marriage here and in, you know, most parts of the developed world." [...] She declared her support for same-sex marriage in August 2015.|$|E
500|$|The {{fact that}} Tucker goes free upholds {{a common theme}} in Homicide: Life on the Street – that life is not always fair, and that criminals {{sometimes}} get away with their crimes, a conviction that often put the show's producers at odds with NBC executives. Fontana deliberately wrote the script {{so that it would}} remain ambiguous whether Tucker committed the murder or not. He wanted the character to have a genuine feeling of love for Adena Watson, but the strong feelings do not specifically mean he killed the girl. Braugher praised Fontana for creating such a three-dimensional character in Tucker, and said, [...] "Fontana's genius <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> never quite certain as to what it is that we have on our hands." [...] Fontana also wanted Pembleton and Bayliss to have different interpretations of the same interrogation; Bayliss begins the interview convinced of the man's guilt and becomes uncertain by the end, and Pembleton has the opposite experience. Multiple police departments have requested copies of [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] for use in training sessions due to its accurate portrayal of the intricacies of the police interrogation process. The interrogation included several police tactics not typically featured in television dramas, including the presentation of false evidence in an attempt to get a confession.|$|E
500|$|Dylan biographer Howard Sounes {{described}} [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] as a [...] "grim masterpiece." [...] The only accompaniment is Dylan's guitar, playing folk-blues riffs and up {{and down}} chord progressions. Author Sean Wilentz has noted that the song's chord structure is similar to that used by the Everly Brothers' in their hit recording of [...] "Wake Up Little Susie". The lyrics of [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] express Dylan's anger at what he sees as the hypocrisy, commercialism, consumerism, and war mentality inherent in contemporary American culture, but unlike those in his earlier protest songs, do not express optimism in the possibility of political solutions. In his book Bob Dylan, Performing Artist, author Paul Williams has suggested that the song addresses [...] "the possibility that the most important (and least articulated) political issue of our times <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all being fed a false picture of reality, and it's coming at us from every direction." [...] Williams {{goes on to say that}} the song successfully paints a portrait of an [...] "alienated individual identifying the characteristics of the world around him and thus declaring his freedom from its 'rules'." [...] As such, a major target in the song is the old, established concepts which give a false picture of reality and hinder new worldviews from being accepted.|$|E
30|$|One {{limitation}} {{of the current study}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> unable to test the performance of other scoring systems such as the colorectal POSSUM, the MPI, PIA II or the PSS in our dataset, as these systems all require some intra-operative or preoperative findings, which were not available to us. On the other hand, the fact that our scores do not require any intra-operative findings could be viewed as an advantage.|$|R
30|$|The {{closest thing}} to {{strategic}} planning <b>we</b> had <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> opportunistically prepared—we would specifically invest in software or skills for staff even if only vaguely related to things we thought we might {{like to be able}} to do—up to a reasonable level—simply so if an opportunity presented itself, someone on staff would know something about <b>that</b> application. <b>We</b> called it ‘popcorn software’.

500|$|Andrew Lindsay was {{confident}} that the Oxford crew would be more motivated than their opponents: [...] "our advantage over Cambridge <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> hungry for the victory. [...] Everyone in the Oxford boat is driven to go and win this damn thing". [...] He was making his third and final appearance in the race having lost in both the 1997 and 1998 race. [...] His grandfather represented Cambridge in the 1930s, and his uncle, Alexander Lindsay, rowed for the losing Oxford crew in the 1959 race before triumphing the following year. [...] Cambridge boat club president and Canadian international rower Brad Crombie was also making his third Boat Race appearance, attempting to complete a hat-trick of victories. [...] Sean Bowden was the head coach of Oxford. His Cambridge counterpart, Robin Williams, suggested [...] "it still feels like all or nothing to us. [...] The fear of defeat, the aim of trying to push the limits is motivation itself". [...] Just {{as he had done}} in the 1993 race, umpire Mark Evans introduced modifications to the starting procedure, suggesting that he would be content to hold the crews for up to ten seconds between issuing the [...] "set" [...] and [...] "go" [...] commands.

500|$|The seventh-season {{premiere of}} the series, which aired on May 20, 2012 in its earlier timeslot, {{continued}} to deliver high ratings attracting almost three million total viewers which exceeded the {{premiere of the}} previous season by 16%. Kim Kardashian has explained {{the success of the}} show by saying that people tune in to watch the series because they can relate themselves {{to the members of the}} family; in an interview with the V magazine she said: [...] "You can see that soap operas aren't on the air as much anymore. I think reality shows are taking over that genre, but I think the draw to our show <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> relatable." [...] The eighth season debuted to 3 million viewers, up 6% from the previous season, while the subsequent ninth season's premiere was down by 20%. The ninth season averaged 3.3 million total viewers and almost 2.2 million in the 1849 years adult demographic, the most sought after by advertisers. It was the highest rated cable show in its timeslot. The series finished as the most-social ad-supported cable program and, as of March 2015, Keeping Up with the Kardashians is the most-watched show on E! network. The first episode of the tenth season averaged 2.5 million viewers, slightly less than the premiere of the ninth season. In 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that Keeping Up with the Kardashians [...] "tends to most popular in areas with large Hispanic populations, particularly in the Southwest".|$|E
500|$|While widely {{considered}} to be a pop punk band, Fall Out Boy has also been described as pop rock emo, and emo pop, and cites emo group The Get Up Kids as an influence among many other bands. When interviewed for a retrospective article in Alternative Press at the time The Get Up Kids disbanded in 2005, Pete Wentz stated that [...] "Fall Out Boy would not be a band {{if it were not for}} The Get Up Kids." [...] Early in the band's career, when Jared Logan was producing the group's debut album, he asked bassist Pete Wentz what sound the band desired for recording. Wentz responded by [...] "handing over the first two New Found Glory records". Wentz also cites Green Day, the Ramones, Screeching Weasel, Metallica, Earth Crisis, Gorilla Biscuits and Lifetime as influences. The band acknowledges its hardcore punk roots as an influence; all four members were involved in the Chicago hardcore scene before joining Fall Out Boy. Wentz described the band's affiliation with the genre by saying [...] "I think the interesting thing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all hardcore kids that are writing pop music...It gives us a different style because at our core we are always hardcore. That aspect is always going to be evident in the music. We are hardcore kids that couldn't quite cut it as hardcore kids." [...] He referred to Fall Out Boy's genre as [...] "softcore": hardcore punk mixed with pop sensibility. Lead singer Patrick Stump, however, is also influenced by artists he listened to while growing up including Prince, Michael Jackson, and David Bowie.|$|E
