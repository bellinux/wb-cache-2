2500|$|Talking {{about the}} title track [...] "Louder", Michele has said, [...] "It's a song that, no matter what, I can play in my car with the windows down. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> shows off my voice as a singer, which is really {{important}} to me, because that’s what I do. I {{want to make sure}} that every song on my record is fun and enjoyable, but also, you hear my voice in them."

I didn't want to fit any mold. I wanted it to be something that couldn't be replicated by anyone else. It was important to me that the album began with [...] "Cannonball" [...] and ended with [...] "If You Say So". I have to acknowledge what I've been through this year. It was really difficult, which I think is represented in [...] "If You Say So" [...] and a song like [...] "Cannonball" [...] represents finding strength and hope. These are the two sides of my life right now. The grief, but also the search for strength and hope. I really wanted those two songs to bookend the album. Really let everyone know where I'm at." ...|$|E

5000|$|I love {{interesting}} voices. I love Rickie Lee Jones, I think she's {{an amazing}} lyricist and songwriter.

Not to say that I wasn’t influenced by Outkast and Andre, but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>it’s</b> a ‘pass-the-torch’ type of moment.

For one morning at least I had been true to myself, without regard to other people or what they might think about it.
