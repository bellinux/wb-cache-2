500|$|Eventually, {{the band}} left their {{independent}} record label Lookout! Records on friendly terms, and signed to Reprise. Signing {{to a major}} label caused many of the band's original fans from the independent music club 924 Gilman Street to regard Green Day as sell-outs. The club has banned Green Day from entering since the major label signing. Reflecting back on the period, lead vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, [...] "I couldn't {{go back to the}} punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure [...] The only thing I could do was <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bike and go forward." ...|$|E
500|$|Kerplunks {{underground}} success led to {{a number}} of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo [...] "was the only person we could really talk to and connect with". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, [...] "I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bike and go forward." [...] After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.|$|E
500|$|Another Green World was {{released}} in September 1975 and did not chart in either the United Kingdom or the United States. The album's reception was {{for the most part}} very favourable. Henry Edwards of High Fidelity wrote positively of the album, claiming it to be Eno's [...] "most accessible to date". Tom Hull of The Village Voice felt that, although it [...] "wouldn't {{be fair to say that}} Another Green World is Eno's best album," [...] the album is definitely [...] "his easiest to love." [...] Charley Walters of Rolling Stone found it a [...] "major triumph" [...] that Eno's creative risks [...] "so consistently pan out", and said that it is [...] "indeed an important record—and also a brilliant one". Negative reviews of the album focused on the lack of the rock songs from Eno's previous albums. Jon Pareles, writing in Crawdaddy!, found its electronic excursions less challenging than Eno's previous progressive rock songs and remarked, [...] "This ain't no Eno record. I don't care what the credits say. It doesn't even <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> nerves." [...] Lester Bangs of The Village Voice was lulled by much of the music and said that [...] "those little pools of sound on the outskirts of silence seemed to me the logical consequence of letting the processes and technology share your conceptual burden". Robert Christgau, who originally gave the album an [...] "A–" [...] in his review for The Village Voice, admitted that he resisted the album at first, but ultimately grew to [...] "love every minute of this arty little collection of static (i.e., non-swinging) synthesizer pieces (with vocals, percussion, and guitar)." [...] He felt that its 13 pieces can be appreciated both individually and as a whole, and called the album [...] "the aural equivalent of a park on the moon — oneness with nature under conditions of artificial gravity." [...] In 1977, Another Green World was voted the 11th best album of 1976 in the Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it second on his own list for the poll.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Amanda Root for The Musical Express magazine, Ullman was asked about critics labeling the show 'non-sexist humour.' Did it exist? [...] "Not unless it’s cleverly done. When we did Three of a Kind we kept getting sketches sent in about me as a traffic warden, or me being a busty barmaid. Writers that have no idea about women - their typical way of starting a sketch is to say, Tracey is sitting there, filing her nails and chewing gum, as if all girls are stupid. Sketches beginning like that used to really <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> nerves. But {{as soon as we}} found the right team of writers, they weren’t into that sort of thing, so it worked out OK." [...] She went on to win her first BAFTA Award in the category of Best Light Entertainment Performance for Three of a Kind in 1984.|$|E

He also worked with his father in the construction industry to support his career. Speaking about his father's role in his career, Nadeau said, [...] "I learned a lot from my dad, Gerry, while I was growing up. He wasn't afraid to yell and <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> toes to do my job because he hated to lose and I hated to lose. He made me the hungriest guy on the race track." ...|$|E
