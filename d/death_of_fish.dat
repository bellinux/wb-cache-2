25|$|Between the 1930s and 1960s {{under the}} {{supervision}} of Robert Moses, several highways including the Henry Hudson, Saw Mill and Mosholu Parkways were constructed within Van Cortlandt Park, requiring Tibbetts Brook to be diverted into culverts under the roadways. The creation of the sewer {{at the south end of}} Van Cortlandt Lake and the construction of the highways induced siltation of the stream, leading to further creation of marshes. In addition, pollution from upstream and the highways, and spillover of chemicals used in the golf course led to the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> inhabiting the lake. In 1978, the fish population of the lake was restored.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to human}} development, Flushing Meadows was {{originally}} a tidal marsh, with Flushing Creek receiving south-flowing waters from the tides of Flushing Bay. Although the lakes were built as freshwater lakes and dammed to mitigate tidal effects, flooding continues {{to effect the}} park. The lakes are also highly eutrophic, due to nutrients such as phosphorus from the former marshland seeping into the water, leading to the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> in the lakes. The regular tidal action that would filter the lakes is prevented by the dam. In addition, the lakes are subject to pollution and storm runoff from the nearby highways, via pipes which feed into the lakes.|$|E
25|$|During the {{investigation}} {{by researchers at}} Kumamoto University, the causal substance had {{been identified as a}} heavy metal and it was widely presumed that the Chisso plant was the source of the contamination. Chisso was coming under closer scrutiny and to deflect criticism, the wastewater output route was changed. Chisso knew of the environmental damage caused by its wastewater and was well aware that it was the prime suspect in the Minamata disease investigation. Despite this, from September 1958, instead of discharging its waste into Hyakken Harbour (the focus of investigation and source of original contamination), it discharged wastewater directly into Minamata River. The immediate effect was the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> {{at the mouth of the}} river, and from that point on, new Minamata disease victims began to appear in other fishing villages up and down the coast of the Shiranui Sea, as the pollution spread over an even greater area.|$|E

50|$|Despite Seechewal's success, the Kali Bein has {{continued}} to suffer in recent years. Inadequate release of water from Mukerian Hydel Channel, the flow back of polluted water from Harike {{and the failure of}} sewage treatment plants led to the mass <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishes</b> in the Kali Bein in 2013.|$|R
25|$|The 2010–2011 midwinter animal mass death events (sometimes {{referred}} to as Aflockalypse) have gained considerable publicity worldwide. Media attention was particularly high for this period. This is {{despite the fact that}} the mass <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> and <b>of</b> birds are quite common. Livestock have also been known to suffer such incidents.|$|R
25|$|Installing {{a barrage}} {{may change the}} {{shoreline}} within the bay or estuary, affecting a large ecosystem that depends on tidal flats. Inhibiting {{the flow of water}} {{in and out of the}} bay, there may also be less flushing of the bay or estuary, causing additional turbidity (suspended solids) and less saltwater, which may result in the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> that act as a vital food source to birds and mammals. Migrating fish may also be unable to access breeding streams, and may attempt to pass through the turbines. The same acoustic concerns apply to tidal barrages. Decreasing shipping accessibility can become a socio-economic issue, though locks can be added to allow slow passage. However, the barrage may improve the local economy by increasing land access as a bridge. Calmer waters may also allow better recreation in the bay or estuary. In August 2004, a humpback whale swam through the open sluice gate of the Annapolis Royal Generating Station at slack tide, ending up trapped for several days before eventually finding its way out to the Annapolis Basin.|$|E
2500|$|By October 1945, DDT was {{available}} for public sale in the United States, used both as an agricultural pesticide and as a household insecticide. [...] Although its use was promoted by government and the agricultural industry, US scientists such as FDA pharmacologist Herbert O. Calvery expressed concern over possible hazards associated with DDT as early as 1944. In 1947, Dr. Bradbury Robinson, a physician and nutritionist practicing in St. Louis, Michigan, warned {{of the dangers of}} using the pesticide DDT in agriculture. DDT had been researched and manufactured in St. Louis by the Michigan Chemical Corporation, later purchased by Velsicol Chemical Corporation, and had become {{an important part of the}} local economy. Citing research performed by Michigan State University in 1946, Robinson, a past president of the local Conservation Club, opined that: ... perhaps the greatest danger from D.D.T. is that its extensive use in farm areas is most likely to upset the natural balances, not only killing beneficial insects in great number but by bringing about the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> birds, and other forms of wild life either by their feeding on insects killed by D.D.T. or directly by ingesting the poison.|$|E

50|$|Environmental {{issues such}} as {{pollution}} from agricultural land flows with high nutrients have choked the fjords, which are causing <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> {{due to lack of}} oxygen. Another problem created is death of porpoises which are caught in the nets. Some 7,000 deaths are typically reported annually.|$|E
5000|$|Natural mortality: {{the removal}} of fish from the stock due to causes not {{associated}} with fishing.

5000|$|And {{in my mind}} I compare {{myself from}} time to time with the orator Crassus, of whom it is {{reported}} that he grew so excessively enamoured of a tame lamprey - a dumb, apathetic, red-eyed fish in his ornamental pond - that it became the talk of the town; and when one day in the Senate Domitius reproached him for having shed tears over the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> this <b>fish,</b> attempting thereby to make him appear a fool, Crassus answered, [...] "Thus have I done over the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> my <b>fish</b> as you have over the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> neither your first nor your second wife." ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>death</b> <b>of</b> {{thousands}} <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> in {{rivers and}} lakes was attributed to the elevated temperatures lowering the amount of oxygen in the water to toxic levels.|$|R
50|$|As well, the {{transgenic}} {{process of}} ISP production {{is widely used}} in society already. Insulin and rennet are produced using this technology. The process does not impact the product; it merely makes production more efficient and prevents the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> which would otherwise be killed to extract the protein.|$|E
50|$|When {{alligator}} weed invades waterways, it {{can reduce}} water flow and quality by preventing light penetration and oxygenation of the water. It can also reduce water bird and fish activity and cause the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> and native plants. Alligator weed mats create a favorable habitat for breeding mosquitoes. Alligator weed is also difficult to control.|$|E
50|$|Spills in {{populated}} areas often {{spread out over}} a wide area, destroying crops and aquacultures through contamination of the groundwater and soils. The consumption of dissolved oxygen by bacteria feeding on the spilled hydrocarbons also contributes to the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish.</b> In agricultural communities, often a year's supply of food can be destroyed instantaneously. Because of the careless nature of oil operations in the Delta, the environment is growing increasingly uninhabitable.|$|E

50|$|High {{levels of}} NO3 in water can {{adversely}} affect oxygen levels for both humans and aquatic systems. Human health issues include methemoglobinemia and anoxia, {{commonly referred to}} as blue baby syndrome. As a result of these toxic effects, regulatory agencies limit the amount of NO3 permissible in drinking water to 45-50 mg1-1. Eutrophication, a decline in oxygen content of water, of aquatic systems can cause the <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> and other marine species. Finally, leaching of NO3 from acidic sources can increase the loss of calcium and other soil nutrients, thereby reducing an ecosystem's productivity.|$|E

40|$|Interactions between {{cyanobacteria}} and herbivorous grazers play {{an important}} role in mediating the responses of freshwater phytoplankton assemblages to nutrient enrichment and top-down manipulation. Negative consequences associated with these interactions include dangerous blooms of harmful blue-green algae that have been implicated in the sickness and <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishes,</b> livestock, and, in extreme cases, humans. Frequently cited mechanisms influencing the interactions between grazers and cyanobacteria include cyanobacterial toxicity and morphology. To tease apart the importance of these mechanisms, I used meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the available literature on this topic.

50|$|In 1954, an {{existing}} biological weapons test site originally constructed on Vozrozhdeniya Island in the Aral Sea in 1948 was greatly expanded by the Soviet Ministry of Defence, including to the neighboring Komsomolskiy Island, and named Aralsk-7. A field scientific research laboratory to conduct biological experiments was expanded, {{and the town}} of Kantubek was constructed to house employees and scientists. Bio-agents tested there included Bacillus anthracis, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, Brucella suis, Rickettsia prowazekii, Variola major (smallpox), Yersinia pestis, botulinum toxin, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. (By 1960, the Soviet biological weapons program also included numerous other research and operational facilities throughout the country.) Aralsk-7 had a history of association with mass <b>deaths</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> various regional plague outbreaks, a saiga antelope die-off, and individual cases of infectious disease among visitors to Vozrozhdeniya Island.|$|R
50|$|On Thursday, 15 September 2011, {{more than}} 500 people from Hongxiao Village protested over the {{large-scale}} <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> {{in a nearby}} river. Angry protesters stormed the factory compound, overturned eight company vehicles, and destroyed the offices before police came to disperse the crowd. Protests continued on the two following nights with reports of scuffle, officials said. Chen Hongming, a deputy head of Haining's environmental protection bureau, said the factory's waste disposal had failed the pollution tests since April. The environmental watchdog has warned the factory but it had not effectively controlled the pollution, Chen added.|$|E

5|$|Sewage outfalls {{into the}} lake are {{proposed}} to be completely stopped by the interception and diversion of feeder lines. Lining the main feeders {{into the lake}} and setting up water treatment plants to continuously treat and recirculate the lake water are also envisioned. Conservation measures proposed for adoption to clean the lake are by way of desilting and deweeding, water treatment at inlet of feeders into the lake, construction of check dams, conservation of ghats, afforestation of denuded hills in the catchment, soil moisture conservation measures, stabilization of sand dunes by planting vegetation of suitable species of plants and restriction of cultivation {{in the bed of}} feeder channels. In addition, the institutional measures considered for effecting improvement of the lake are mass awareness programmes with the population's participation as well as the control <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> proliferation to reduce the risk <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishes</b> during periods <b>of</b> inadequate water depth in the lake.|$|R
2500|$|Large {{volumes of}} water enable more {{stability}} {{in a tank}} by diluting effects from death or contamination events that push an aquarium away from equilibrium.
