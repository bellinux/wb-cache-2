25|$|In <b>free-running</b> ("chopped") mode, the {{oscillator}} (which may {{be simply}} a different operating mode of the switch driver) blanks the beam before switching, and unblanks it {{only after the}} switching transients have settled.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} primary mutant alleles of dbt: dbtS, which shortens the organism's <b>free-running</b> period (its {{internal}} period in constant light conditions); dbtL, which lengthens the <b>free-running</b> period; and dbtP, which causes pupal lethality and eliminates circadian cycling proteins and per and tim transcription. All mutants except for dbtS produce differential PER degradation that directly correspond with their phenotypic behavior. DbtS PER degradation resembles wild-type DBT, {{which suggests that}} dbtS {{does not affect the}} clock through this degradation mechanism. It has been suggested that dbtS works by acting as a repressor or producing a different phosphoylation pattern of the substrate. DbtS causes early termination of per transcription.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{previous}} installments, Desmond {{can leave}} the Animus at almost any time. This allows Desmond to explore the present-day town of Monteriggioni. The player is also offered virtual training, a mini-game where the player may test their <b>free-running</b> or combat skills.|$|E
25|$|In hamsters, the CK1ε-tau {{mutation}} {{was first}} discovered by Michael Menaker and colleagues while studying a laboratory shipment of Syrian hamsters. The prominent phenotype in the mutant hamsters was an unusually short <b>free-running</b> period — 22 hours in heterozygotes, and 20 hours in homozygotes for the mutation—making this allele semidominant. The gene was later mapped and identified by Joseph Takahashi and colleagues, which revealed a single base-pair C-to-T substitutional mutation in the hamster CK1ε gene. This {{single nucleotide polymorphism}} (SNP) results in an arginine-to-cysteine substitution in a phosphate recognition domain region of CK1ε, a highly conserved region of the gene across mammals. Presently, {{it is unclear how}} exactly the CK1ε-tau mutation results in a shorter <b>free-running</b> period. The CK1ε-tau mutation in hamsters was the first full description of a mammalian circadian mutant.|$|E
25|$|Triggered sweeps {{can display}} a blank screen {{if there are}} no {{triggers}}. To avoid this, these sweeps include a timing circuit that generates <b>free-running</b> triggers so a trace is always visible. Once triggers arrive, the timer stops providing pseudo-triggers. Automatic sweep mode can be de-selected when observing low repetition rates.|$|E
25|$|Dual-trace {{oscilloscopes}} have a {{mode switch}} to select either channel alone, both channels, or (in some) an X‑Y display, which uses the second channel for X deflection. When both channels are displayed, {{the type of}} channel switching can be selected on some oscilloscopes; on others, the type depends upon timebase setting. If manually selectable, channel switching can be <b>free-running</b> (asynchronous), or between consecutive sweeps. Some Philips dual-trace analog oscilloscopes had a fast analog multiplier, and provided a display of {{the product of the}} input channels.|$|E
25|$|They {{have a few}} (widely spaced) {{frequency}} ranges, {{and relatively}} wide-range continuous frequency control within a given range. In use, the sweep frequency is set to slightly lower than some submultiple of the input frequency, to display typically at least two cycles of the input signal (so all details are visible). A very simple control feeds an adjustable amount of the vertical signal (or possibly, a related external signal) to the sweep oscillator. The signal triggers beam blanking and a sweep retrace sooner than it would occur <b>free-running,</b> and the display becomes stable.|$|E
25|$|An {{organism}} whose circadian clock {{exhibits a}} regular rhythm corresponding to outside signals {{is said to}} be entrained; the rhythm so established persists even if the outside signals suddenly disappear. If an entrained human is isolated in a bunker with constant light or darkness, he or she will continue to experience rhythmic increases and decreases of body temperature and melatonin, on a period which slightly exceeds 24 hours. Scientists refer to such conditions as <b>free-running</b> of the circadian rhythm. Under natural conditions, light signals regularly adjust this period downward, so that it corresponds better with the exact 24 hours of an Earth day.|$|E
25|$|The Class GL {{made use}} of Beyer, Peacock's {{standard}} lever-actuated Sterling-type steam-operated power reverser and a Pyle National Company turbo-generator. The piston valves were modern straight-ported types with long-lap, long-travel valves, used {{for the first time}} in a South African Garratt which made the Class GL very <b>free-running</b> and more efficient than its predecessors. The cylinders, of the same bore and stroke as those of the Class 14, drove the third coupled axles using long connecting rods which stabilised the locomotive by reducing vertical forces at the crosshead to a minimum. This method of design became the standard on most Beyer-Garratts thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The Animus Project Update 1.0 {{included}} a new game mode {{and a new}} map. The game mode, Advanced Alliance, is {{a version of the}} Alliance mode, with target identification and engagement more difficult than in the original, thus providing a more challenging experience for players. With three teams of two players each, Advanced Alliance is a tougher test for players and rewards teams that work together. The new map, Mont Saint-Michel, is located on a rocky tidal island of Normandy in France. Its particular topography of narrow streets, high-perched bell-tower, and multi-leveled architecture is perfect for hunters and predators alike to surge from out of nowhere to execute their prey. To survive, recruits need to use <b>free-running</b> and narrow roads to their advantage.|$|E
25|$|The Animus Project Update 2.0 {{included}} a new game mode and map. The Pienza Map provides a <b>free-running</b> playground with wide-open plaza areas, where predators and targets can quickly blend and disappear, surrounded by narrow alleys and multi-story buildings for extra verticality. In the new Chest Capture multiplayer mode, two teams composed of three players compete as Hunters and Protectors; partnered with fellow Templars, Hunters {{will attempt to}} steal {{the contents of the}} chests scattered around the map as protectors attempt to prevent this. Also included in the update is a Templar Score feature to reward diligent work by Abstergo recruits. Advanced Alliance is also packaged with the new DLC, while the Mont Saint-Michel map is not. Only one DLC can be activated at a time, so players will either be missing the new map from the 1.0 update or the new mode, new map and Templar Scoring from the 2.0 update.|$|E
500|$|Vulcan B.2s were {{eventually}} fitted with the twin-gyro <b>free-running</b> gyroscopic heading reference system (HRS) Mk.2, {{based upon the}} inertial platform of the Blue Steel missile, which had been integrated into the system when the missile had been carried. [...] With the HRS a navigator's heading unit (NHU) was provided which enabled the navigator plotter to adjust the aircraft heading, through the autopilot, by as little as 0.1 degrees. The B.2 (MRR) was additionally fitted with the LORAN C navigation system.|$|E
500|$|Titanfall is {{a shooter}} game played from a first-person perspective. Players fight as <b>free-running</b> foot soldier [...] "pilots" [...] who can command agile, mech-style exoskeletons—"Titans"—to {{complete}} team-based objectives. The game {{is set on}} derelict and war-torn colonies at the Frontier fringe of space exploration as either the Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation (IMC) or the Frontier Militia. Online multiplayer is the sole game mode, but contains single-player elements such as plot, character dialogue, and non-player characters (NPCs). Titanfall has no offline, single-player, or local splitscreen modes, and does not support system link over a local area network (LAN). Respawn founder Vince Zampella described the game as bringing [...] "scale, verticality, and story" [...] to the first-person shooter genre of multiplayer gaming.|$|E
500|$|The {{title was}} not {{shown at the}} 2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) with the {{explanation}} {{that the company had}} spent the year [...] "rebuilding the technology", but a tie-in movie was mentioned as in production and a Saints Row 3 announcement was expected at the December Spike VGAs. Saints Row: The Third was finally announced officially in March 2011. The team wanted to include many different features and items, so scoping the final product became an issue. They laid out their ideas on a schedule and began to cut until over [...] "4000 man-days of scheduled work" [...] were removed, including features such as <b>free-running</b> (called [...] "freegunning") and a cover system. Competitive multiplayer was removed due to its lack of popularity in the previous series entries. In retrospect, Phillips said he wanted to remove more. The studio borrowed people {{from other parts of the}} company to finish the project. Writer Drew Holmes expressed the difficulty in determining what was too risqué for the game. In keeping with series advertising, Saints Row: The Third included a porn star, Sasha Grey, in the production as a character voice. Other celebrity voice actors include Hulk Hogan and Daniel Dae Kim.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} all this and the {{introduction}} of more recent Pacifics, {{in the middle of the}} 1950s Gresley types continued to have a quasi-monopoly of East Coast Main Line express passenger services, and as the Sixties approached they went through yet another series of improvements comparable to those of the 1920s. The most significant of these was the fitting of the French double Kylchap exhaust system, which was entirely due to the persistence from 1956 of P. N. Townend, Assistant District Motive Power Superintendent at King's Cross locomotive shed. [...] These modifications greatly reduced exhaust back pressure, making the locomotives more economical and <b>free-running,</b> and also kept the firetubes clean, reducing turn-around time, so much so that they were able to fit into the more intensive diesel locomotive workings. The Kylchap arrangement was already being universally applied to the A4 streamlined Pacifics, though with the non-streamlined A3 locomotives, the soft exhaust would cause the smoke and steam to drift into the driver's forward vision. The solution came in the form of narrow German-style smoke deflectors, which somewhat changed the appearance of the A3 locomotives in their latter days.|$|E
500|$|... de Candolle {{also made}} {{contributions}} {{to the field of}} chronobiology. Building upon earlier work on plant circadian leaf movements contributed by such scientists as Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan and Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau, de Candolle observed in 1832 that the plant Mimosa pudica had a <b>free-running</b> period of leaf opening and closing of approximately 22–23 hours in constant light, significantly less than the approximate 24-hour period of the Earth's light-dark cycles. Since the period was shorter than 24 hours, he hypothesized that a different clock had to be responsible for the rhythm; the shortened period was not entrained—coordinated—by environmental cues, thus the clock appeared to be endogenous. Despite these findings, a number of scientists continued to search for [...] "factor X", an unknown exogenous factor associated with the earth's rotation that was driving circadian oscillations {{in the absence of a}} light dark schedule, until the mid-twentieth century. In the mid-1920s, Erwin Bunning repeated Candolle's findings and came to similar conclusions, and studies that showed the persistence of circadian rhythm in the South Pole and in a space lab further confirmed the existence of oscillations in the absence of environmental cues.|$|E
500|$|Planning {{and early}} {{development}} of Innocence began between March and April 2006, with full [...] development beginning in late 2006 to early 2007. Total development {{time came to}} roughly {{a year and a}} half. It was being developed {{at the same time as}} Tales of the Tempest, another Tales title for the DS, as the next main entry in the Tales series, as opposed to Tempest which would become a spin-off title. While Tempest was conceived as a [...] "compact" [...] version of a Tales title, Innocence was designed to include all the elements expected from a mainline console title, meaning it was created with very different development goals. Rather than by established Tales developer Namco Tales Studio, Innocence was developed by Alfa System, a Japanese studio that had previously worked on the first two Tales of the World spin-off titles. They were chosen to work on the game because of their previous successful efforts with these spin-offs. It was the company's first title for the DS. While developing the title, the team drew on previous difficulties suffered while developing Tempest to promote a smoother development and better final product. The team tweaked the battle system used for the title so that it felt fresh to series veterans while still retaining its identity. One of these aspects was the new character growth system, which relied on customization more than gaining levels in a linear fashion through experience; the theme behind the creation of this system was [...] "a more profound battle with wider frontage". The team incorporated an updated version of the <b>free-running</b> ability from Tales of the Abyss so players could have maximum freedom in battle.|$|E
2500|$|Switching {{channels}} can be asynchronous, that is, <b>free-running,</b> with trace blanking while switching, {{or after}} each horizontal sweep is complete. Asynchronous switching is usually designated [...] "Chopped", while sweep-synchronized is designated [...] "Alt". A given channel is alternately connected and disconnected, {{leading to the}} term [...] "chopped". Multi-trace oscilloscopes also switch channels either in chopped or alternate modes.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978 Canterbury {{became known}} as [...] "The Bulldogs". Nicknames such as [...] "Cantabs" [...] "CBs" [...] and [...] "Berries" [...] were seen to be [...] "soft" [...] and the club wanted {{something}} to signify determination and grit. A grand final appearance in 1979, followed by a grand final win in 1980 with a young, enthusiastic and <b>free-running</b> side dubbed [...] "The Entertainers", {{was the beginning of}} a golden era that was to produce three more grand final wins in the 1980s: 1984, 1985 and 1988.|$|E
2500|$|This {{suggested}} that the Class GL had still more to give, which was confirmed on the following day's testing when a load of [...] was hauled over the same stretch of track. As {{a result of these}} tests, the further six Class GL locomotives were ordered for delivery in 1930. Apart from demonstrating the Class GL's power and capacity for hauling heavy trains, these tests also showed that their running qualities were exceptional, being smooth and <b>free-running</b> machines. In many ways, the Class GL set a design standard which was followed later in the Class GM, Class GMA and Class GO.|$|E
2500|$|While {{playing as}} the Assassin characters, {{the games are}} {{generally}} presented as third-person in an open world, focusing on stealth and <b>free-running.</b> The games use a mission structure to follow the main story, generally assigning the player to complete an assassination of public figureheads or a covert mission. Alternatively, several side missions are available, such as mapping out the expansive cities from a high perch followed by performing a [...] "leap of faith" [...] into a haystack below, collecting treasures hidden across the cities, exploring ruins for relics, building a brotherhood of assassins to perform other tasks, or funding the rebuilding of a city through purchasing and upgrading of shops and other features. At times, the player is in direct control of Desmond, who by nature of the Animus use has learned Assassin techniques through the bleeding effect, {{as well as their}} genetic ability of Eagle Vision, which separates friend, foe and assassination targets by illuminating people in different colors. Through the Animus interface, the player can go back to retry any past mission already completed; for example, in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner such as by only killing the mission's target.|$|E
60|$|At {{first she}} went on blithely enough with him shut down beside her. But then his spell began to take hold of her. The dark, seething potency of him, {{the power of a}} {{creature}} that lies hidden and exerts its will to the destruction of the <b>free-running</b> creature, as the tiger lying {{in the darkness of the}} leaves steadily enforces the fall and death of the light creatures that drink by the waterside in the morning, gradually began to take effect on her. Though he lay there in his darkness and did not move, yet she knew he lay waiting for her. She felt his will fastening on her and pulling her down, even whilst he was silent and obscure.|$|E
6000|$|So {{much for}} the {{material}} results to the sex. What are the moral results? One does not like to speak of them, particularly {{to those who do}} not and can not know--to good women in whose innocent minds female immorality is inseparable from flashy gowning and the painted face; to foolish, book-taught men who honestly believe in some protective sanctity that hedges womanhood. If men of the world with years enough to have lived out of the old régime into the new would testify in this matter there would ensue a great rattling of dry bones in bodices of reform ladies. Nay, if the young man about town, knowing nothing of how things were in the [...] "dark backward and abysm of time," [...] but something of the moral difference between even so <b>free-running</b> a creature as the society girl and the average working girl of the factory, the shop and the office, would speak out (under assurance of immunity from prosecution) his testimony would be a surprise to the cartilaginous virgins, blowsy matrons, acrid relicts and hairy males of Emancipation. It would pain, too, some very worthy but unobservant persons not in sympathy with [...] "the cause." ...|$|E
6000|$|Presently my boatman yelled, [...] "Sailfish!" [...] We {{looked off}} to port {{and saw a}} big {{sailfish}} break water nine times. He was perhaps five hundred yards distant. My boatman put on speed, and, as my boat is fast, {{it did not take}} us long to get somewhere near where this big fish broke. We did our best to get to the exact spot where he came up, then slowed down and trolled over the place. In this instance I felt a light tap on my bait and I jumped up quickly, both to look and let him take line. But I did not see him or feel him any more. We went on. I saw a flash of bright silver back of my brother's bait. At the instant he hooked a kingfish. And then I felt one cut my bait off. Kingfish are savage strikers and they almost invariably hook themselves when the drag is set. But as I fish for sailfish with a <b>free-running</b> reel, of course I am exasperated when a kingfish takes hold. My brother pulled in this kingfish, which was small, and we rebaited our hooks and went on again. I saw more turtles, and one we almost ran over, he was so lazy in getting down. These big, cumbersome sea animals, once they get headed down and started, can disappear with remarkable rapidity. I rather enjoy watching them, but my boatman, who is a native of these parts and therefore a turtle-hunter by instinct, always wore a rather disappointed look when we saw one. This was because I would not allow him to harpoon it.|$|E

50|$|While the Per3 gene is a paralog to the PER1 and PER2 genes, {{studies in}} animals {{generally}} {{show that it}} does not contribute significantly to circadian rhythms. Functional Per3-/- animals experience only small changes in <b>free-running</b> period, and do not respond significantly differently to light pulses. Per1-/- and Per2-/- animals experience a significant change in <b>free-running</b> period; however, knocking out Per3 in addition to either Per1 or Per2 has little effect on <b>free-running</b> rhythms. Furthermore, Per1-/-Per2-/- mice are completely arrhythmic, indicating that these two genes have much more importance to the biological clock than Per3.|$|E
