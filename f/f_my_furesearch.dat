This project explores Audre Lorde's autobiographical work Zami: A New Spelling o <b>f</b> <b>My</b> Name and poetry from The Black Unicorn using Homi Bhabha's theory of hybridity in order to situate Lorde's work in postcolonial canon, acknowledging Lorde's subject position as the daughter of West Indies Caribbean immigrants. I argue that the transformation of poetic form in The Black Unicorn from Lorde's previous poetry represents a claim to West Indian heritage through linguistic hybridity and that Zami: A New Spelling o <b>f</b> <b>My</b> Name exemplifies many characteristics and tropes in postcolonial narratives, and that Lorde does so deliberately to reclaim an identity that has been denied to her as a result of immigration...|$|R

40|$|As is customary, {{an effort}} was made to remove the {{background}} by some form of subtraction of stimulus independent activity, as indicated in Eq. 1 of the paper. In general, conditions of the tissue drift in time and some background still remains. This and other unwanted signal were removed by the GIFA method [1, 2], which greatly enhances the traditional subtraction procedure. This we briefly describe. Suppose, we have M equally spaced orientations, θm = (m− 1) π/M, m = 1, [...] ., M, so that the optical response images can be partitioned into stimulus sets fm(t, x) = f(t, θ = θm, x), where for the moment we ignore SF and contrast. We form f m(x) = 〈fm(t, x) 〉t and from this the overall average f(x) = 〈fm(x) 〉m. In such terms, the covariance is formed KS(x, y) ∝ � m (f m(x) −f(x)) (<b>f</b> <b>m(y)</b> −f(y)), which for unlimited data would contain only the true signals. Thus, KS {{is referred to as the}} signal operator. Similarly KN(x, y) ∝ � m,t (fm(t, x) − f m(x)) (fm(t, y) − <b>f</b> <b>m(y))</b> is referred to as the noise operator. The GIFA procedure determines a set of orthonormal functions {φn}, all of which meet a criterion of statistical significance, such that (φ, KSφ) x is maximized subject to the cost function (φ, KNφ) x. This procedure is related to Fisher’s discriminant and canonical variate analysis [3] of multivariate statistics, and represents a significant data analysis improvement in the present context. Once the set {φn} is determined, the data are appropriately projected onto the signal space spanned by these functions. Figure 1 : Results of performing an analysis à la Shoham [4] on the data presented in this paper. This image compares the ratio of the data acquired at 0. 14 c/deg, averaged over all orientations, to data acquired at 1. 12 c/d, also averaged over all orientations.

40|$|Abstract Left Deslocation (LD) and Focus (F) are {{phenomena}} {{characterized for}} putting in relief a constituent {{of the oral}} text. In other words, they are focusing strategies frequently used in Brazilian Portuguese (BP). For this reason, I intend to confront them in this paper, in order to check (a) their limits and (b) their structural domains. Thus, my purpose is {{to answer the following}} questions: (i) Are these phenomena independent, or do they exert mutual influence in at least some ways? (ii) Is there an obligated superposing between them? (iii) if not, what are the actuation domains (syntactic and/or phonological) of LD and F? (iv) What are the prosodic features of LD and F constituents? (v) What kinds of discursive-pragmatic phenomena motivate LD and <b>F?</b> <b>My</b> main aim is to show that LD shouldn’t be analized as a focus marker in BP, because Focus must be faced as a prosodic category that require a Contrastive Intonation. </span...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Jamaica Kincaid, {{arguably the}} most popular Caribbean woman writer living in the USA, has {{produced}} many o f her bestsellers by dissecting her personal and familial history. Yet {{in spite of her}} inclination to anchor the life o f her creative inventions in her personal and intimate experience, Kincaid, known for her radicalism and militancy, can be a fiercely polit ical writer. The aim o f this essay is to explore how Kincaid handles the trope o f race in her novel The Autobiography o <b>f</b> <b>My</b> Mother, how she uses racial imagery to unearth the covert mechanisms that account for the intricacies of identity formation and how she dismantles ide ological foundations that paved the way for racial exploitation. 1 will in particular focus on how Kincaid challenges, undermines and recasts the (post) colonial concept o f race by show ing that racial identity is a shifting category conceived through interaction with other cate gories o f identification such as class and gender...|$|R
