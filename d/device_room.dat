Figure  1 f depicts typical id-V curves measured {{at room temperature}} of 300 K for the V 2 O 5 NW with d at 400 ± 50 nm and the inter-distance between two contact electrodes (l) at 7.3 μm. A representative FESEM image of the individual V 2 O 5 NW device is also shown in the inset of Figure  1 f.

In this study, we extend the all-electrical spin injection and detection studies into different systems like Si and GaAs using half-metal Fe 3 O 4 as a spin injector in the presence and absence of tunnel barrier MgO. Injection into GaAs is verified using conventional Fe/MgO/GaAs <b>devices.</b> <b>Room</b> temperature spin injection into both p-type and n-type Si is achieved and the spin injection could be observed down to 100 K.
