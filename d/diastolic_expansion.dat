50|$|The fall in {{arterial}} blood pressure results from pericardial fluid accumulation increasing {{pressure on the}} outside of the heart that limits the maximum size the ventricles can stretch to. This limits <b>diastolic</b> <b>expansion</b> (filling) which results in a lower EDV (End Diastolic Volume) which reduces stroke volume, a major determinant of systolic blood pressure. This is in accordance with the Frank-Starling law of the heart, which explains that as the ventricles fill with larger volumes of blood, they stretch further, and their contractile force increases, thus causing a related increase in systolic blood pressure.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of the pericardium on cardiovascular phenomena has been examined and evaluated {{in the light of}} both ventricular function (modified Starling) curves and pressure-volume relation-ship of the pericardium. When the left ventricle is stressed, as by an increased aortic resistance, it dilates. The resulting pericardial tension limits right ventricular <b>diastolic</b> <b>expansion</b> and right ventricular work. By this mechanism pulmonary blood volume and pressures are kept at lower levels than would otherwise be present. The pericardium also protects against ventriculo-atrial regurgitation which may account for the observed descending limb of the classically conceived Starling curve. THIS communication will deal with the{{influence of}} the pericardium on cardio-vascular hemodynamics especially when the circulation is subjected to abnormal con-ditions such as pronounced stress of the left ventricle. Data will be presented which appear to support the following: The pericardium restrains diastolic expan-sion and, therefore, ventricular work at high atrial or end-diastolic ventricular pressures. When the left ventricle is severely stressed and dilated, the pericardium restrains <b>diastolic</b> <b>expansion</b> of the right ventricle and, therefore, limits right ventricular work; the consequences are lower pulmonary capillary and left atrial pressures than would result if the pericardium were not present. The pericardium protects against tricuspid or mitral valve regurgitation at high ventricular filling pressures; the significance of this for the so-called descending limb of the Starling curv...|$|E

We {{hypothesized}} that positive inotropic stimulation during healing after myocardial infarction might increase contractile {{pull on the}} infarct segment, increase expansion and promote ventricular dilation. Background. The effect of prolonged inotropic stimulation on left ventricular remodeling during healing after myocardial infarction has not been studied. Methods. The effects of 6 weeks of inotropic stimulation on in vivo changes in left ventricular topography, function and mass (serial two-dimensional echocardiograms), hemodynamic variables, postmortem topography (planimetry) and collagen (hydroxyproline content) were studied in 36 chronically instrumented dogs randomized, 2 days after small anterior infarction, to digoxin (0. 125 mg daily) and no digoxin (control group). Results. Heart rate and arterial and left atrial pressures were similar in the two groups, but the first derivative of left ventricular pressure (peak dP/dt), systolic thickening of the noninfarct wall and systolic thinning of the infarct wall {{were higher in the}} digoxin group during the 6 weeks. At 6 weeks, infarct scar size and collagen content were similar in both groups, but the digoxin group had more infarct expansion and thinning. Between 2 days and 6 weeks, the digoxin group showed more in vivo <b>diastolic</b> infarct <b>expansion,</b> thinning and bulging; more aneurysm but less global dilation and increase in mass; and no change in ejection fraction. The effects of inotropic stimulation on remodeling were more marked in infarcts with 100 % than 85 % transmurality. Conclusions. Prolonged inotropic stimulation with digoxin during healing after small anterior infarction increases infarct bulging without decreasing infarct collagen content and preserves global ventricular size, mass and systolic function...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with primary pulmonary hypertension, {{competition between the}} right and left ventricles for the limited pericardial space results in distortion of left ventricular geometry reflected in displacement of the ventricular septum toward the left ventricular cavity. Left ventricular shape is most dramatically deranged at end-systole and early diastole, suggesting the possibility that the distribution of left ventricular diastolic filling might be altered. To investigate this hypothesis, nine {{patients with}} primary pulmonary hypertension and nine normal individuals were studied with echocardiographic techniques. Left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time was significantly prolonged in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension by comparison with normal individuals (129 ± 36 versus 53 ± 9 ms, p < 0. 005) and the fraction of the transmitral flow velocity integral occurring {{in the first half of}} diastole was significantly less than in normal individuals (38 ± 14 % versus 70 ± 9 %, p < 0. 005). Measurement of fractional changes in short-axis left ventricular cavity area similarly demonstrated that in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension fractional early <b>diastolic</b> cavity <b>expansion</b> (32 ± 11 %) was significantly less than in normal individuals (78 ± 9 %, p < 0. 005). In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, the ventricular septum was abnormally flattened toward the left ventricular cavity at end-systole (normalized septal curvature 0. 04 ± 0. 19) and remained that way throughout early diastolic filling but returned toward normal at end-diastole (normalized septal curvature 0. 68 ± 0. 19, p < 0. 005). Thus, in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension end-systolic and early diastolic deformation of the left ventricle by septal flattening toward the left ventricular cavity is associated with relative underfilling of the left ventricle in early diastole and redistribution of left ventricular filling into late diastole. The reliance on late diastolic filling and atrial systole to maintain left ventricular preload in primary pulmonary hypertension may have important implications for the use of vasodilators in this disease...|$|R
40|$|Background-The {{mechanisms}} of reduced angina on second exertion {{in patients with}} coronary arterial disease, {{also known as the}} warm-up angina phenomenon, are poorly understood. Adaptations within the coronary and systemic circulations have been suggested but never demonstrated in vivo. In this study we measured central and coronary hemodynamics during serial exercise. Methods and Results-Sixteen patients (15 male, 61 +/- 4. 3 years) with a positive exercise ECG and exertional angina completed the protocol. During cardiac catheterization via radial access, they performed 2 consecutive exertions (Ex 1, Ex 2) using a supine cycle ergometer. Throughout exertions, distal coronary pressure and flow velocity were recorded in the culprit vessel using a dual sensor wire while central aortic pressure was recorded using a second wire. Patients achieved a similar workload in Ex 2 but with less ischemia than in Ex 1 (P < 0. 01). A 33 % decline in aortic pressure augmentation in Ex 2 (P < 0. 0001) coincided with a reduction in tension time index, a major determinant of left ventricular afterload (P < 0. 001). Coronary stenosis resistance was unchanged. A sustained reduction in coronary microvascular resistance resulted in augmented coronary flow velocity on second exertion (both P < 0. 001). These changes were accompanied by a 21 % increase in the energy of the early <b>diastolic</b> coronary backward-traveling <b>expansion,</b> or suction, wave on second exercise (P < 0. 05), indicating improved microvascular conductance and enhanced left ventricular relaxation. Conclusions-On repeat exercise in patients with effort angina, synergistic changes in the systemic and coronary circulations combine to improve vascular-ventricular coupling and enhance myocardial perfusion, thereby potentially contributing to the warm-up angina phenomenon.

40|$|A short axis echocardiographic cut of {{the heart}} from the subcostal {{approach}} was used to study the atrioventricular junction in 47 infants and children with congenital heart disease and 20 with normal hearts. Examination of the diastolic openings of both atrioventricular valves was able to establish normal developments of the valves and annuli even when this was found in cases of complex congenital heart disease. In 30 patients with atrioventricular septal defects the technique distinguished between a partial defect (when the two atrioventricular valves were linked transseptally) and a complete defect (when {{there was only one}} atrioventricular valve). A range of atrioventricular attachments was seen in these patients.

40|$|A U T H O R S ’ SYNOPSIS Changes in left {{ventricular}} internal diameter resulting from increasing intra-pericardial pressure induced {{by increasing the}} pericardial fluid volume were studied in closed chest, anaesthetized dogs. Left ventricular internal diameters were measured by placing an ultrasonic dimension catheter in the left ventricle {{at the time of}} the experiments. With increasing pericardial pressure, significant increases occurred in heart rate and mean left atrial pressure. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter progressively decreased as the pericardial pressure was elevated. After beta adrenergic blockade with propranolol (1 mg/kg), the decline in end-systolic diameter during pericardial tamponade was significantly reduced. These observations indicate the importance of the systolic reserve and the role of beta adrenergic receptors in the adaptation of the left ventricle to increases in pericardial tamponade. ‘The cardiovascular changes occurring during pericardial tamponade (Starling, I 897; Kuno, 1915; Gibbon and Churchill, 1931; Spodick, 1959) are attributed to limited ventricular <b>diastolic</b> <b>expansion</b> (Isaacs et al, 1954).

40|$|To {{investigate}} the left ventricular wall dynamics {{conducive to the}} third heart sound (S 3) in both hyper- and hypodynamic filling conditions, eight dogs were studied in which an S 3 was produced by hypoxemia and in eight others by acute mitral regurgitation. Pulse transit sonomicrometry crystals were used to measure external left ventricular dimension dynamics in the two principal axes. A miniature accelerometer was used to detect the epicardial S 3 vibration. The development of the S 3 was invariably {{associated with an increased}} peak velocity of long-axis external dimensional expansion in early diastole. This enhanced long-axis filling activity was not dependent on increased global chamber or short-axis filling dynamics and sometimes occurred when global filling rate was unchanged. In addition, the short-axis filling rate was sometimes reduced as the S 3 developed. It is concluded that the common denominator of S 3 generation in this acute dog model is exaggerated longaxis <b>diastolic</b> <b>expansion</b> activity which is present in both hyper- and hypodynamic left ventricular filling...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary atresia with intact {{ventricular}} septum and diastolic liver expansion An 18 -year-old {{woman with}} pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum palliated by classic Glenn anastomosis and right ventricle to {{left pulmonary artery}} opening was referred to our tertiary centre {{for the assessment of}} severe tricuspid regurgitation. The patient presented with a history of palpitations and tenderness of the right hypochondrium. The liver was enlarged, pulsatile and tender on palpation. Surprisingly, the hepatic expansion was noted to be asynchronous with the radial pulse. On transthoracic echocardiogram and cardiac MRI, the right ventricle was small and heavily hypertrophied (panel A). The right atrium, inferior vena cava and hepatic veins were markedly dilated (panels A and B). There was no significant tricuspid stenosis or regurgitation. During atrial contraction, there was an antegrade flow to the pulmonary trunk throughout the respi-ratory cycle (panel C, red arrow) and concomitant reverse flow to the hepatic veins (panel D, green arrow). The main clinical concerns in our patient are liver failure and probable atrial arrhythmias.

40|$|AUTHORS ’ SYNOPSIS. In 13 {{dogs with}} experimentally-induced acute pericardial tamponade, volume load {{increased}} cardiac output by 170 % as pericardial and right arterial pressure increased. Acetyl-strophanthidin did not sigiii$cantly change stroke volume or cardiac output. Isoproterenol augmented cardiac output by 240 % and reduced venous pressure. Pericardial tamponade produces marked limitation in cardiac function. The physiological {{basis for the}} abnormal circulatory state is the high intraperi-cardial pressure which limits <b>diastolic</b> <b>expansion</b> of the ventricles and thereby impedes venous return, with consequent reduction in cardiac output and arterial pressure. Pericardiocentesis is the therapy of choice, but under certain circumstances it may be advantageous to assist the circulation before removal of the pericardial fluid. Several workers have studied the haemodynamic effects of therapeutic manoeuvres other than peri-cardiocentesis. Kuno (191 7) reported that adren-aline in one dog with cardiac tamponade caused an increase in cardiac output and an elevation of arterial pressure. He postulated that the adrenaline reduced intrapericardial pressure by diminishing {{the volume of the}} heart. Isaacs, Berglund, and Sarnoff (1954) showed that an increase of blood volume significantly increased aortic pressure and cardiac output in mild to moderate tamponade, but that, in severe tamponade, volume infusion pro-duced little improvement. Other authors have speculated about the value of pressor or sympa-thomimetic agents, but no studies are available. Similarly the literature contains no satisfactory information concerning the use of digitalis in the treatment of pericardial tamponade...|$|E
40|$|Controversy exists {{about whether}} {{one-dimensional}} wave theory {{can explain the}} "self-canceling" waves that accompany the diastolic pressure decay and discharge of the arterial reservoir. Although it has been proposed that reservoir and wave effects be treated as separate phenomena, thus avoiding the issue of self-canceling waves, we have argued that reservoir effects are a phenomenological and mathematical subset of wave effects. However, a complete wave-based explanation of self-canceling <b>diastolic</b> <b>expansion</b> (pressure-decreasing) waves {{has not yet been}} advanced. These waves are present in the forward and backward components of arterial pressure and flow (P ± and Q ±, respectively), which are calculated by integrating incremental pressure and flow changes (dP ± and dQ ±, respectively). While the integration constants for this calculation have previously been considered arbitrary, we showed that physiologically meaningful constants can be obtained by identifying "undisturbed pressure" as mean circulatory pressure. Using a series of numeric experiments, absolute P ± and Q ± values were shown to represent "wave potential," gradients of which produce propagating wavefronts. With the aid of a "one-dimensional windkessel," we showed how wave theory predicts discharge of the arterial reservoir. Simulated data, along with hemodynamic recordings in seven sheep, suggested that self-canceling diastolic waves arise from repeated and diffuse reflection of the late systolic forward expansion wave throughout the arterial system and at the closed aortic valve, along with progressive leakage of wave potential from the conduit arteries. The combination of wave and wave potential concepts leads to a comprehensive one-dimensional (i. e., wave-based) explanation of arterial hemodynamics, including the diastolic pressure decay.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the value of two-dimensional echocardiography in detecting constrictive pericarditis. Serial two-dimensional echocardiography was performed in eight closed chest conscious dogs with experimental constrictive pericarditis, using a new model that creates constrictive pericarditis by the introduction of a pericardial irritant mixture. Constrictive pericarditis was confirmed in these dogs by cardiac catheterization and pathologic examination. Four patients with constrictive pericarditis and three patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy (amyloidosis) were also studied. Analysis of short-axis two-dimensional echocardiograms was performed to determine the frame by frame change in left ventricular cavity areas throughout diastole. Curves of diastolic left ventricular cavity area change versus percent duration of diastole were constructed for each animal and human subject. Pericardial thickness was measured at various gain settings on two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiograms and at postmortem examination. In dogs with constrictive pericarditis, the echocardiograms seriously overestimated and correlated poorly with pathologic measurements of pericardial thickness. In dogs after constrictive pericarditis developed, 69 ± 11 % (mean ± SD) (range 50 to 84) of cavity area change occurred in the initial 30 % of diastole compared with 35 ± 7 % (range 20 to 45) in control two-dimensional echocardiograms (p < 0. 001). Four patients with constrictive pericarditis showed similar accelerated cavity expansion in early diastole, but three patients with cardiac amyloidosis showed more variable left ventricular <b>diastolic</b> <b>expansion</b> rates. It is concluded that two-dimensional echocardiograms can demonstrate characteristic diastolic filling abnormalities in constrictive pericarditis, but cannot accurately measure pericardial thickness...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: In off-pump {{coronary}} surgery, {{exposure of}} posterior vessels via sternotomy causes deterioration of cardiac function. Changes in ventricular geometry, valve competence, and hemodynamics after retraction of the beating heart were studied. Subsequently, the modifying effect of {{right or left}} heart bypass was investigated. Methods: In six 80 -kg pigs, an ultrasound probe {{was attached to the}} backside of the left ventricle and the heart was fully retracted with a suction tissue stabilizer. Five pigs underwent additional pump support. Results: During retraction, the right ventricle was squeezed between the pericardium and interventricular septum, thereby decreasing its diastolic cross-sectional area by 62 % ± 6 % (P <. 001) while, concomitantly, right ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased to 165 % ± 19 % (P =. 004) of basal values. Stroke volume and mean arterial pressure decreased by 29 % ± 6 % and 23 % ± 8 % (P =. 007 and P =. 02, respectively). Left ventricular shape became somewhat elliptic without changes in preload pressure, and its diastolic cross-sectional area decreased by 20 % ± 3 % (P =. 001). All valves were competent. Right heart bypass restored left ventricular cross-sectional area, stroke volume, and mean arterial pressure. In contrast, left heart bypass increased blood pressure only marginally. Conclusions: Ninety-degree anterior displacement of the beating porcine heart caused primarily right ventricular dysfunction as a result of mechanical interference with <b>diastolic</b> <b>expansion</b> without concurring valvular incompetence. Right heart bypass normalized stroke volume and mean arterial pressure by increasing left ventricular preload; in contrast, left heart bypass failed to restore systemic circulation.

40|$|Objectives. We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the utility of left ventricular expansion velocities in differentiating constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy. Background. Several {{studies have shown that}} left ventricular <b>diastolic</b> <b>expansion</b> is influenced by the elastic recoil forces of the myocardium. These forces are affected by intrinsic myocardial disease but should be preserved when diastole is impaired as a result of extrinsic causes. Methods. Using Doppler tissue imaging, we measured peak early velocity of longitudinal axis expansion (Ea) in 8 patients with constrictive pericarditis, 7 patients with restriction and 15 normal volunteers. Transmitral early (E) and late (A) Doppler flow velocities, left ventricular systolic and diastolic volumes, ejection fraction and mitral annular M-mode displacement were also compared between the groups. Results. The Eavalue was significantly higher in normal subjects (14. 5 ± 4. 7 cm/s [mean ±SD]) and in patients with constriction (14. 8 ± 4. 8 cm/s) than in those with restriction (5. 1 ± 1. 4 cm/s, p < 0. 001 constriction vs. restriction). There was weak correlation between Eaand the extent of annular displacement (r = 0. 55, p = 0. 004) and the E/A ratio (r = 0. 44, p = 0. 03). There was no correlation between Eaand E (r = 0. 33, p = 0. 07) or ejection fraction (r = 0. 21, p = 0. 26). By multivariate analysis, Eawas the best variable for differentiating constriction from restriction. Conclusions. Our study indicates that longitudinal axis expansion velocities are markedly reduced in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy. The poor correlation found with transvalvular flow velocities suggests that Eamay be relatively preload independent. The measurement of longitudinal axis expansion velocities provides a clinically useful distinction between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy and may prove to be valuable in the study of diastolic function...|$|E
40|$|AbstractReperfusion {{performed}} {{too late}} to salvage myocardium decreases chronic infarct expansion in experimental animals. However, the acute effects of delayed reperfusion are not known. Twenty-two dogs underwent 3 (n = 8), 4 (n = 8) or 6 h (n = 6) of circumflex artery occlusion followed by 3 h of reperfusion. Effects of reperfusion on <b>diastolic</b> <b>expansion</b> were assessed in two ways: 1) change in mean radius of curvature of the infarct segment, and 2) change in {{the ratio of the}} length of the diameter {{from the center of the}} infarct zone to the opposite wall (septal-lateral diameter) to the length of the diameter perpendicular to this (anteroposterior diameter). Effects on systolic expansion were examined with quantitative two-dimensional echocardiographic systolic thickening analysis. Delayed reperfusion produced an immediate decrease in diastolic infarct expansion. The ratio of septal-lateral/anteroposterior diameters, which had increased with occlusion from a preocclusion baseline of 0. 98 ± 0. 06 to 1. 13 ± 0. 08 (p < 0. 001), decreased with reperfusion to 1. 02 ± 0. 07 at 15 min and 1. 03 ± 0. 08 at 3 h of reperfusion (p = 0. 001). This was due solely to a decrease in the septal-lateral diameter. The radius of curvature of the infarcted segment increased from 2. 1 ± 0. 5 cm before reperfusion to 2. 74 ± 0. 8 cm at 15 min and 2. 6 ± 0. 85 cm at 3 h of reperfusion (p = 0. 009). This occurred despite a significant (13. 6 %) decline in end-diastolic cavity area and is compatible with flattening of the reperfused infarct region. Systolic infarct expansion also improved slightly. The length of the abnormally contracting segment decreased by 13 ± 20 % (p = 0. 02), and systolic thinning was abolished (− 5 ± 5 %, 1 ± 5 % and 1 ± 3 % respectively, at the three time points, p = 0. 05). Globally, cavity area shrinkage increased from 27 ± 7. 5 % before reperfusion to 33 ± 7 % at 15 min (p = 0. 02) and 30 ± 6 % (p = NS) at 3 h. In conclusion, late coronary reperfusion leads to an acute reduction in diastolic infarct expansion. Although this reduces end-diastolic cavity area (and thus preload), global systolic function is preserved because systolic infarct expansion is reduced, and the decline in preload is regional, involving primarily the noncontractile infarcted segment. Late reperfusion has potentially important applications to the acute as well as to the chronic stages of myocardial infarction...|$|E
