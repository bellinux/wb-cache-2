5000|$|In {{simplest}} terms, ownership on the [...] "record date" [...] usually, but {{not always}} (because of the case of large special dividends), determines who is <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> a <b>dividend.</b> The ex-dividend date always identifies who is ultimately <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> receive a <b>dividend.</b>|$|R
5000|$|While {{members of}} a {{non-stock}} corporation are not <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>dividends,</b> {{if it is a}} for-profit corporation, they are <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> share in the proceeds in the event the corporation is liquidated; this is not available if the corporation is non-profit; if a non-profit is liquidated, all the proceeds must either be donated to another surviving non-profit or escheated to the government.|$|R
50|$|An {{investor}} who wishes <b>to</b> be <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> the <b>dividend</b> {{does not have}} to wait until after the record date to sell the stock; however, the investor must hold the stock until the ex-dividend date. If the investor were to sell the stock on the ex-dividend date or afterwards, the investor would still be <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> the <b>dividend</b> payment. In this example, assuming that the investor purchased the stock one day before the ex-dividend date, the investor would be a stockholder on the record date. If the investor sells the stock on the ex-dividend date, the buyer of the stock would be a stockholder one day after the record date given the three stock business trading day settlement. The person that bought the stock would not be <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> receive the <b>dividend.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>To</b> be <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> {{a special}} <b>dividend</b> {{of less than}} 25% of the share price, {{you need to be}} a {{stockholder}} on the record date. To be a stockholder on the record date, your purchase would need to have been made a minimum of three business days prior to the record date, and you would still have to own it on that day. The ex-dividend date, i.e. the first date in which a new buyer of shares would not be <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> the <b>dividend,</b> is two business days prior to the record date (see ex-dividend date for exceptions).|$|R
50|$|The {{ex-dividend}} date is two {{business days}} prior to the record date. To be a stockholder on the record date an investor must purchase the stock before the ex-dividend date. The latest date he can buy the stock to be a stockholder on record and be <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> the <b>dividend</b> would be one day prior to the ex-dividend date (this includes extended hours (pre-market and after-hours) of that day) {{to allow for the}} three stock trading day settlement of the stock purchase. If the investor purchases the stock the day before the ex-dividend date the investor would be a stockholder on the record date and would be <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> receive the <b>dividend</b> payment.|$|R
50|$|The {{ex-dividend}} date, {{also known}} as the reinvestment date, is an investment term involving the timing of payment of dividends on stocks of corporations, income trusts, and other financial holdings, both publicly and privately held. If a sale is before this date, the <b>dividend</b> belongs <b>to</b> the new owner; if on or after the date, the seller is <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> the <b>dividend.</b>|$|R
50|$|For example, say XYZ {{is priced}} at $40 today, {{and has a}} special {{dividend}} of $1. Since call option holders are not <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>dividends,</b> a holder of an option to buy stock XYZ at $30 will not receive the $1 special dividend. However, after paying the cash dividend, then (all else being equal) XYZ will drop to $39, as it has paid out $1 of its value. However, the option to buy a $39 stock at $30 is worth less than the option to buy a $40 stock at $30. Therefore, option exchanges have formulas to adjust contracts appropriately when special dividends are paid out. In this case, the call option to buy at $30 will be converted to a call option to buy at $29, which will keep the option value roughly the same.|$|R

50|$|Dividend {{stripping}} is {{the practice}} of buying shares a short period before a dividend is declared, called cum-dividend, and then selling them when they go ex-dividend, when the previous owner is <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> the <b>dividend.</b> On the day the company trades ex-dividend, theoretically the share price drops {{by the amount of}} the dividend. However, the experience is that quality companies tend to recover the value of the dividend within a matter of weeks, at which time they trade normally.|$|R
50|$|The company's {{transition}} into an off-price fashion business was relatively smooth, but the Ames preferred stock it {{received in the}} Zayre transaction was a problem. While the stock was <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> annual <b>dividends,</b> Ames {{had the option of}} paying the first four semiannual dividends with more Ames preferred stock rather than cash, an option that Ames exercised for each of the payments it had met. The value of Ames preferred stock was dubious, however, as Ames was closing stores and experiencing losses.|$|R
50|$|As is {{the case}} with all dividends, if you sell your stock prior to the {{ex-dividend}} date, within the due bill period, you relinquish your right <b>to</b> the <b>dividend.</b> The earliest you can sell your stock and still be <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> the special <b>dividend</b> is the date the stock begins trading on an ex-distribution basis, or generally one day after the dividend payment date, on the ex-dividend date.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the close company rules in chapter 56 - 57 within the Swedish income tax law (IL). The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the outsider rule in 57 : 5 IL. If a shareholder or a family member works or have worked actively within the company within the fiscal year or the last five fiscal years then the partner has qualified shares and is to be taxed according to the special closed company rules. If an outsider, directly or indirectly, is a significant shareholder within the company, and directly or indirectly, are <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>dividends</b> then an active partner only has qualified shares if there is special reasons. When making the assessment regard {{must be made to}} conditions under the fiscal year or the last five fiscal years. There is special reason not to apply the rule if there are agreements regarding how the profit should be split or cross-ownerships between companies. If a taxpayer can show that an outsider own 30 percent of the closed company and has a right <b>to</b> <b>dividends</b> and there is no special reason to why the rule should not be applied then the outsider rule is applicable. If the rule is applicable it means that all the shareholders within the company will be taxed for dividends and capital gain with a 25 percent tax rate...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of a special {{dividend}} of 25% or more, however, special rules that are quite different apply. If you sell stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date, your shares will be sold with a book entry sometimes called a [...] "due bill," [...] which denotes that (though the company will pay the <b>dividend</b> <b>to</b> your account, if you are the shareholder of record on the date three business days prior to the record date), your account must, in turn, turn the amount of that <b>dividend</b> over <b>to</b> the buyer of your stock. Conversely, if you buy stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date of a large special <b>dividend,</b> you are <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> the <b>dividend</b> and will receive it via the due bill process.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, a shareholder’s {{expectation}} of receiving a dividend {{has been limited}} by the discretion {{the board of directors}} has to recommend the appropriate amount of payment as a dividend. As a general rule, shareholders will only be <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> a <b>dividend</b> after the dividend is declared (normally, at the general meeting), or when the actual date arrives for the <b>dividend</b> <b>to</b> be paid. Because courts were traditionally reluctant to interfere with the internal management of companies, the remedies available to shareholders to compel a company <b>to</b> declare a <b>dividend</b> were very limited. As a result, if the directors have decided <b>to</b> withhold <b>dividend</b> payment, courts will only make an order requiring <b>dividends</b> <b>to</b> be paid under very exceptional circumstances. In this article, the authors discuss the case of Sumiseki Materials Co Ltd v Wambo Coal Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 235, which is exceptional for the court’s recognition of a shareholder’s contractual right <b>to</b> a <b>dividend.</b> The article analyses the court’s approach, which found that withholding dividend payments was oppressive and unfairly prejudicial conduct of the company.

5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of the IPO, {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of the share offering. Although the share prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed that much of the money would go directly to the Glazers. Furthermore, holders of class A shares would not be <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> a regular <b>dividend,</b> and the structure of the share issue meant that the Glazers' class B shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares, essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in the share price from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total sale value of $233million (£150million).|$|R
40|$|I {{examine the}} dynamic pricing of multi-listed equity shares from the {{universe}} of Chinese com-panies traded in mainland China (A-shares) and Hong Kong (H-shares). Even though each equity pair represents the identical claims to the residual earnings of a single entity, which the investors are <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> same <b>dividends</b> and voting rights from either share class, persistent and time-varying differences are priced {{in the majority of}} such shares. In this paper, I provide a review of the extant literature, and subsequently I describe and ana-lyze how different local market environments affect the cross-market A-H share price disparity. Differing from the theory proposed in Heaton and Lucas (1994), I argue the contrary and empiri-cally test whether market incompleteness, notably evidenced by the lack of financial innovations and the capital account restrictions in mainland China, lowers the equity risk premia in the mainland market on an aggregate level. Drawing from the conjecture in Fernald and Rogers (2002), I show that the variation in the aggregate A-H share premia {{can be explained by the}} risk profiles of alternative investment vehicles in mainland China. Finally, using a unique account-level brokerage data-set, I extrapolate the contributions of noise-driven investors to idiosyncratic mis-pricing through event-driven studies...|$|R
5000|$|Under U.S. Federal {{income tax}} law, an REIT is [...] "any corporation, trust or {{association}} {{that acts as}} an investment agent specializing in real estate and real estate mortgages" [...] under Internal Revenue Code section 856. The rules for federal income taxation of REITs are found primarily in Part II (sections 856 through 859) of Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. Because a REIT is <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> deduct <b>dividends</b> paid <b>to</b> its owners (commonly referred to as shareholders), a REIT may avoid incurring {{all or part of}} its liabilities for U.S. federal income tax. To qualify as a REIT, an organization makes an [...] "election" [...] to do so by filing a Form 1120-REIT with the Internal Revenue Service, and by meeting certain other requirements. The purpose of this designation is to reduce or eliminate corporate tax, thus avoiding double taxation of owner income. In return, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income into the hands of investors. A REIT is a company that owns, and in most cases, operates income-producing real estate. REITs own many types of commercial real estate, ranging from office and apartment buildings to warehouses, hospitals, shopping centers, hotels and even timberlands. Some REITs also engage in financing real estate. The REIT structure was designed to provide a real estate investment structure similar to the structure mutual funds provide for investment in stocks.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the signalling effect of dividend changes {{with a focus}} on how investors react <b>to</b> <b>dividend</b> changes during volatile markets. The signalling effect should be associated with the perceived information asymmetry between corporate insiders (i. e., managers) and the general public. The question is, does this asymmetry increase or decrease during uncertain times? Do managers really know comparatively more (compared to regular investors) about the future in uncertain times, or do the differences reduce because it is associated more with a systematic type of risk? My research shows that investors, in general, are more sensitive <b>to</b> <b>dividend</b> increase than <b>to</b> <b>dividend</b> decrease. Also during volatile markets, investor decision making is sensitive <b>to</b> <b>dividend</b> change announcement and the signaling effect of dividend changes during volatile markets is a function of dividend change announced...|$|R
40|$|According the {{dividend}} signalling hypothesis, {{it is expected}} {{a positive relationship between}} dividend change announcements and the subsequent share price reactions.

The study applies the panel data approach to three European markets. The results show that the market reaction <b>to</b> <b>dividend</b> change announcements is negatively associated with the firm size. We find that the negative market reaction <b>to</b> <b>dividend</b> increase announcements is associated with firms that have, on average, lower dividend changes and higher growth opportunities.

40|$|Section 11 (a) of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 <b>entitles</b> taxpayers <b>to</b> a {{deduction}} {{in respect}} of expenditure actually incurred, provided that all the other requirements of section 11 and section 23 of the Act have been met. A company may issue its own shares, credited as fully paid up, as a payment for trading stock or services rendered, {{as was the case}} in C:SARS v Labat Africa (2011) 74 SATC 1. The question that was raised by this decision is whether the issue of shares constitutes “expenditure” as contemplated in section 11 (a) of the Act. It is trite that a share in a company is a bundle of rights which <b>entitle</b> the holder <b>to</b> <b>dividends</b> when declared and to a vote in shareholders’ meetings and that a share does not come into the hands of a shareholder by way of transfer from the company, but is rather created as a bundle of rights for him in the company. In C: SARS v Labat Africa, the Supreme Court of Appeal decided that to issue shares as a payment for goods is not expenditure as contemplated in section 11 (a) of the Act. The Act does not define “expenditure”. It has been interpreted in certain cases as a payment of money or disbursement, while it has been interpreted as the undertaking of a legal obligation in other cases. The Labat Africa case has been criticised for its interpretation of expenditure on the grounds that it is contrary to the principle that “actually incurred” does not mean “actually paid”. This research has argued that, in the context of the Labat Africa case, which related to an issue of shares in payment for goods, Harms AP’s judgment was concerned with showing why a share issue is not expenditure.
