50|$|Tipperary {{went into}} decline {{following}} this victory and Doyle decided {{to retire from}} inter-county hurling. On {{his way home from}} posting a letter to the county board announcing his retirement Doyle bumped into selector John Joe Callanan. Callanan told Doyle that the regular corner-back was ill, and asked Doyle if he would take his place and mark the great Christy Ring. Doyle agreed and he produced perhaps the greatest display of marking {{in the history of the}} game, <b>hoding</b> the legendary Ring scoreless through 150 minutes of championship hurling. Tipperary later defeated Limerick by 1-16 to 2-10 to take the provincial title. It was Doyle's fourth Munster medal. On 4 September 1949 Tipperary and Laois faced off in the All-Ireland decider. In a one-sided affair Tipp completely overpowered the Leinster champions on a score line of 3-11 to 0-3, giving Doyle his third All-Ireland medal.|$|E

This study is conducted in Indonesian Stock Exchange with population of stock listed in LQ 45 index with the total of 64 firms. The samples taking method in purposive sampling with the criteria that the firms at least listed twice in LQ 45 index on the study period. The analysis method used to analyze independend variable: spread, market value, variance return, and dividend pay out ratio and dependend variable: holding period is two stage least squares multiple regression model, since there is possibility that the correlation of bid-ask spread from the current periods and bid-ask spread and holding period and holding period from the previous period for every stock take place simultaneously. The result of study showed thar, partially, bid-ask spread variable that constitutes the different value between the highest price provided paid by buyer with the lowest price offered by seller has significance positive correlation on holding period of common stock and there is inverse correlation/significance negative between variance return variable that reflect the risk rate from stock effected by fluctuation     of stock price and holding period of common stock. While simultaneously, there is not significance correlation between dependent variable and independend variable that mean bid-ask spread, market value, variance return and dividend pay out ratio can’t describe variation from <b>hoding</b> period variable. </p...|$|E

40|$|Macrophage apoptosis, a {{key process}} in atherogenesis, is {{regulated}} by oxidation products, including hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (<b>HODEs).</b> These stable oxidation products of linoleic acid (LA) are abundant in atherosclerotic plaque and activate PPARγ and GPR 132. We investigated the mechanisms through which <b>HODEs</b> regulate apoptosis. The effect of <b>HODEs</b> on THP- 1 monocytes and adherent THP- 1 cells {{were compared with}} other C 18 fatty acids, LA and α-linolenic acid (ALA). The number of cells was reduced within 24 hours following treatment with 9 -HODE (p < 0. 01, 30 μM) and 13 <b>HODE</b> (p < 0. 01, 30 μM), and the equivalent cell viability was also decreased (p < 0. 001). Both 9 -HODE and 13 -HODE (but not LA or ALA) markedly increased caspase- 3 / 7 activity (p < 0. 001) in both monocytes and adherent THP- 1 cells, with 9 -HODE the more potent. In addition, 9 -HODE and 13 -HODE both increased Annexin-V labelling of cells (p < 0. 001). There was no effect of LA, ALA, or the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone (1 μM), but the effect of <b>HODEs</b> was replicated with apoptosis-inducer camptothecin (10 μM). Only 9 -HODE increased DNA fragmentation. The pro-apoptotic effect of <b>HODEs</b> was blocked by the caspase inhibitor DEVD-CHO. The PPARγ antagonist T 0070907 further increased apoptosis, suggestive of the PPARγ-regulated apoptotic effects induced by 9 -HODE. The use of siRNA for GPR 132 showed {{no evidence that the}} effect of <b>HODEs</b> was mediated through this receptor. 9 -HODE and 13 -HODE are potent—and specific—regulators of apoptosis in THP- 1 cells. Their action is PPARγ-dependent and independent of GPR 132.
