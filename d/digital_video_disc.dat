The response of anime fans {{was that the}} fall in sales was because Odex's products were inferior, inaccurately translated, and released later than the online versions. Odex subsequently attributed the inaccurate subtitling on censorship laws against mature themes (such as yaoi) and on fansubbers—anime fans who had translated the Japanese dialogue—whom they had hired. In response, the Board of Film Censors said {{that it did not}} ask for subtitles to be changed, that it merely classified content, and that the onus was on distributors to ensure accurate subtitles. In addition to problems of quality and scheduling, criticisms were directed at Odex's litigious strategy and poor public relations. Odex received support from the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore (AVPAS) in making its demands for compensation.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The warpage of injection–compression-molded optical media, such as com-pact <b>discs</b> and <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>discs,</b> due to {{asymmetric}} cooling during {{production is}} predicted. Thermally induced stress is calculated with a nonisothermal compressible flow simulation with a viscoelastic constitutive model. A {{finite element analysis}} is formulated with axisymmetric plate elements based on Kirchhoff thin-plate theory to simulate the warpage of the disc due to the asymmetric thermal stress and gravity after demolding. Simulation results of warpage for compact-disc-recordable moldings are compared with experimental observations under different processing conditions, such as the melt temperature, mold temperature, and packing pressure, with an optical grade of polycarbonate. The comparison shows that the simulation well predicts the effects of various processing conditions. Both the simulation and experiment indicate that of the processing conditions, the mold temperature has the greatest effect o...|$|R

INTRODUCTION Digital media such as the Internet and <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>discs</b> use compression to make efficient use of time and bandwidth. Airborne reconnaissance has traditionally used wetfilm photography, but has recently switched to electro-optic (EO) photography [1].

Many movie producers lament about how the existence of rampant movie piracy has greatly reduced their profits, and they take concerted efforts in fighting both online and hard goods piracy. In order to evaluate how movie piracy has affected both movie producers and consumers, we develop a simple theoretical model consisting of both the traditional theatrical movie market and the modern <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>discs</b> (DVD) market. While prices, demand and profits of movie theatres and DVDs are adversely affected by movie piracy, consumers gain most with an early availability of pirated movies.

40|$|Wide-band audio coding {{algorithms}} {{have become}} very popular due to emerging digital audio applications for network, wireless and multimedia computing systems. Digital storage of audio signals, which results in reduced size and higher quality is commonplace in compact <b>discs,</b> <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>discs</b> and has became a standard in most of audio/video portable electronic devices. Current state-of-the-art coding systems are application-specific. Although, {{it is hard to}} objectively measure quality across available audio codecs, it can be safely claimed that there is no generic codec that performs sufficiently well for all potential applications under all channel conditions. The state of the art audio systems are developed as a combination of several coding techniques and codec modes to meet all requirements. Therefore, there is a strong requirement to encode all types of signal using the same analysis model. In this proposal, our objective is to develop a novel wideband generic speech/audio coding technique that will take advantage of long temporal contexts.

40|$|The {{flow and}} {{thermally}} induced birefringence of injection-compression molded optical media such as compact <b>discs</b> and <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>discs</b> is predicted by applying a stress-optical rule to the flow and thermally induced stresses, which are estimated with a viscoelastic material model {{integrated into a}} non-isothermal compressible flow simulation. The resulting model considers flow and cooling induced molecular orientation, and the transient effect of thermal stress and pressure. Contrary to previous research for polystyrene, the validated results indicate that, for polycarbonate, {{the magnitude of the}} thermally induced birefringence is comparable to the flow induced birefringence. Simulation results of the flow and thermally induced in-plane birefringence for compact-disc-recordable moldings with an optical grade of polycarbonate compared well with experimental observations at different mold and melt temperatures.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies how {{a yearly}} religious fiesta dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe {{in the rural}} community of La Plaza del Limón, Michoacán, Mexico is preserved {{without the support of}} an archive. The study addresses discussions in archival studies concerning the need for investigations in the archival preservation of intangible cultural heritage by way of theory-building. I conducted ethnographic fieldwork by observing and interviewing the townspeople, the fiesta's organizers, and local videographers. I analyzed the data using grounded theory and the approach known as “dimensional analysis” developed by Leonard Schatzman in the tradition of Anselm L. Strauss. By way of this approach I arrived at the theory that the fiesta of Our Lady of Guadalupe is preserved through informal records. The principal dimensions in support of this theory include: the “living identity” of the community that is evolving and embedded in the lives of inhabitants of La Plaza; the “memory infrastructures” embodied in the memory of the town’s inhabitants’ recollection of the past and transmitted through oral history; “devotional labor” enacted every year by the Catholic Church members who organize the fiesta, and the local and visiting attendants who participate in festive activities such as praying, dancing, and socializing; and finally, “material production,” specifically the works of local videographers who produce <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>discs</b> that are distributed to the Mexican diaspora in the U.
