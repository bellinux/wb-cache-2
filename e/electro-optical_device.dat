50|$|Spreeta is an <b>electro-optical</b> <b>device</b> {{utilizing}} surface plasmon resonance {{to detect}} {{small changes in}} refractive index of liquids. The Spreeta device was developed by Texas Instruments, Inc. in the 1990s. Device design incorporates a light-emitting diode (LED) illuminating a thin metal film (usually gold) in the Kretchmann geometry (needed to excite surface plasmons). The reflected light is detected by a photodiode linear array (which translates angle of reflection to pixel position) and the resonance (a dip in the reflectivity at a specific angle of incidence) denotes the refractive index on the outer surface of the metal film. Applications include real-time measurement of binding of antigens to antibodies attached to the sensor surface, monitoring changes in oil quality, and measuring sugar content in drinks (Brix level).|$|E

40|$|Controlling {{the spatial}} and {{temporal}} organization of functional polymers {{is essential for the}} development of switchable soft-matter based <b>electro-optical</b> <b>devices.</b> By using a combination of a liquid crystal template, a photopatternable substrate (for spatial control) and electric fields (for dynamically switching) we show that we are able to dynamically control the spatial organization of polymers across multiple length scales (conveyed through the patterned liquid crystal template). The polymer that we organize is an azobenzene-functionalized polyisocyanide, whose stiff polymeric helix and laterally attached pendant azobenzene units induce tangential anchoring to the liquid crystal host. Due to the donor-acceptor functionalized azobenzene units, the polymeric material is strongly absorbing in the visible range for characterization purposes. We find that polymers align locally to the liquid crystal director field and reversibly change its orientation by the application of an electric field. Since this hybrid technique can be easily applied to other functional polymeric materials and relies on simple techniques, such as spincoating, photoalignment and electric fields, we believe it has great potential {{for the development of a}} wide range of switchable <b>electro-optical</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R
