The family placed a <b>high</b> <b>value</b> <b>on</b> education. Hawking's father wanted his son to attend the well-regarded Westminster School, but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill {{on the day of the}} scholarship examination. His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans. A positive consequence was that Hawking remained with a close group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats, and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception. From 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components.|$|E

It is likely that treatment of this condition will continue to evolve {{in the direction of}} deintensification, in order to minimize loss of function but maintain disease control. In the absence of specific clinical trials and guidelines, patient preferences need to be taken into consideration to minimise short and long term toxicity and functional loss and optimize quality of life, given the prolonged survival frequently seen. This may involve exploring patients' values regarding trade-offs of disease control against adverse effects of treatment. Patients who have received CRT as primary treatment for OPC place a <b>high</b> <b>value</b> <b>on</b> survival, and although agreeing that deintensification is desirable, were reluctant to trade off much survival advantage for lower toxicity, though {{would be more likely to}} forgo chemotherapy than accept reduced radiation.|$|E
