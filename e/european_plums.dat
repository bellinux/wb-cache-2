40|$|Morphological {{properties}} of fruit bearing shoots: length, number of flower buds and vegetative buds and their ratio were studied in 11 cultivars of European plum and 11 cultivars of Japanese plum during a two-year period. Fruit bearing shoots {{were divided into}} two groups: long (shoots) and short (spurs). For all studied traits, statistically significant differences between plum cultivars were found. Japanese plums had lesser thickness and shorter internodes of shoots in relation to <b>European</b> <b>plums.</b> They also had a significantly higher number of flower buds both on shoots and spurs. Based on obtained results, recommendations for pruning can be made. Cultivars with a higher number of flower buds per 1 -m length and in relation to vegetative buds, like most varieties of Japanese plum and some varieties of European plum ("Stanley", "Topper", "Top", "Topking"), require severe pruning. On the other hand, cultivars with lower density of flower buds, such as "Čačanska rana" and "Golden Plum", can be pruned slightly...|$|E

In this study we evaluated the quality of two <b>european</b> <b>plums</b> cultivars ('Ramasin' and 'Ariddo di Core' with purple and yellow flesh colour respectively) after modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) storage, through {{the selection of the}} most appropriate indicators. The headspace gas composition, the flesh fruit firmness (FFF), the soluble solid content (SSC), the titratable acidity (TA), the colour and the chlorophyll content of plums wrapped with 5 different films (F 1, F 2, F 3, F 4 and F 5) were evaluated for up 21 days of storage (at 1 ± 1 °C and 90 - 95 % relative humidity). For both cultivars, the multilayered films (F 1 and F 2, 90 and 65 μm respectively) offered better effectiveness over other films. The total chlorophyll concentration, showing a good correlation with the colorimetric parameters of luminance (L∗) and chroma (respectively R 2 = 0. 92 and R 2 = 0. 96) confirmed, {{in the case of the}} Ariddo di Core cultivar, the results obtained by monitoring other parameters thus highlighting the usefulness of integrating multiple indexes in evaluating the performance of the storage methods used...|$|E

The {{experiment}} was established in a randomized block design, in four replications, with 5 trees per plot. In 2006 - 2009, records of vegetative growth, abundance of blooming, yield, and fruit weight were taken. The first significant yield was achieved in the third year after planting. In 2008 - 2009 trees of ‘Shiro ’ had an abundant yield (48. 5 kg∙tree- 1). ‘Shiro ’ produced a sig-nificantly higher yield compared to other cultivars. There were no significant differ-ences between ‘Amers ’ (27. 3 kg∙tree- 1) and the Japanese plum cultivars ‘Kometa’ (29. 2 kg∙tree- 1) and ‘Skoropłodnaja ’ (21. 5 kg∙tree- 1). Japanese plum fruits were sig-nificantly smaller compared to the European ones. The cultivar ‘Amers ’ had the heaviest fruit (53 g).

40|$|In 1987 a {{selection}} program was started {{to find a}} dwarfing rootstock for <b>European</b> <b>plums.</b> Prunus spinosa (blackthorn) was the chosen species due to its winter hardiness, drought tolerance and previously shown compatibility with plum. In 1990 about 1000 blackthorn seedlings were budded with ‘Opal’ plum. Based on the vigour of the trees {{during the first year}} in the nursery, 113 selections were selected for further testing for their effect on tree development and fruit production. The amount of root suckers and thorns were used as additional selection criteria. In 1999 the number of selections was reduced to 24. In several trials carried out between 2006 and 2011, the vigour and yield of ‘Victoria’ on these selections was shown to vary between that on the commonly used rootstock ‘Saint Julien A’ and ‘Krymsk 1 ’ (VVA- 1), a dwarfing and highly productive rootstock that had been introduced in the Netherlands concurrently with the trials. Although ‘Krymsk 11 ’ gives very good tree-size control and precocity, it is too dwarfing for some soils and cultivars and sensitive to bacterial canker caused by Pseudomomas syringae. Recently, the five most promising selections were planted in higher numbers. The best selection will be released as soon as it has been registered, and virus free material becomes available.

40|$|An {{effective}} in vitro culture system for mature nodal segments of <b>European</b> <b>plum</b> (Prunus domestica) was established. Several {{important aspects of}} regeneration from nodal explants were studied for adaptation of <b>European</b> <b>plum</b> in Bangladesh. Leaf explants were used for callus induction and ½ MS media supplemented with 1. 0 mg/l indole butyric acid (IBA) + 0. 5 mg/l naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) induced low efficiency callus. The nodal segments of 1. 5 cm were cut from young plants, sterilized and established in vitro. The successful cultures were achieved on MS media supplemented with 2 - 6 mg/l kinetin (KIN); 2, 3, 5 mg/l benzyleaminopurine (BAP) and 4 mg/l KIN combination with 2 mg/l BAP. The highest number of shoot length (1. 20 ± 0. 15 cm), highest number of shoot (3. 00 ± 0. 35 cm), and highest number of leaf (14. 25 ± 1. 45) were observed at KIN 4. 0 mg/l. The successful multiple shoots were achieved on MS media with 2 - 6 mg/l KIN, 4 mg/l KIN combination with 2 mg/l BAP. This indicates that, in general, <b>European</b> <b>plum</b> species is very responsive to in vitro regeneration from nodal segment. The shoots from micro cutting were rooted in MS media supplemented with 1. 0 mg/l IBA and with 0. 5 mg/l BAP; ½ MS media supplemented with 0. 5 mg/l IBA + 0. 5 mg/l NAA and 1. 0 mg/l IBA + 0. 5 mg/l BAP.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine selected biochemical properties of partially purified fractions of chlorophyllase (Chlase, chlorophyll chlorophyllido-hydrolase, EC 3. 1. 1. 14) from leaves of three Prunus species: bird cherry (Prunus padus L.), <b>European</b> <b>plum</b> (Prunus domestica L.), and sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.). Secondarily, this report was aimed at comparing seasonal dynamics of Chlase activity and chlorophyll a (Chl a) content within investigated plant systems. Molecular weight of native Chlase F 1 has been estimated at 90 kDa (bird cherry) and approximately 100 kDa (<b>European</b> <b>plum</b> and sour cherry), whereas molecular mass of Chlase F 2 varied from 35 kDa (<b>European</b> <b>plum)</b> to 60 kDa (sour cherry). Furthermore, enzyme fractions possessed similar optimal pH values ranging from 7. 6 to 8. 0. It was found that among a broad panel of tested metal ions, Hg + 2, Fe + 2, and Cu + 2 cations showed the most pronounced inhibitory effect on the activity of Chlase. In contrast, the presence of Mg + 2 ions influenced a subtle stimulation of the enzymatic activity. Importantly, although Chlase activity was negatively correlated with the amount of Chl a in leaves of examined Prunus species, detailed comparative analyses revealed an incidental decrement of enzymatic activity in early or moderately senescing leaves. It provides evidence that foliar Chlase is not the only enzyme involved in autumnal chlorophyll breakdown and further in-depth studies elucidating this catabolic process are required.

Morphological characterization was performed by evaluating 33 qualitative characters of leaves and fruits. Results allowed differentiating the accessions by their genotypic profile and their phenotype. The accessions were grouped in six genotypic profiles according to their genetic similarity and in seven clusters according to their fruit and leaf traits. High similarity was found between the ‘Reine Claude Verte’ commercial cultivars. Some of the prospected accessions sharing the same genotypic profile showed some morphological differences, whereas some accessions with different genotypic profiles presented fruit traits similar to ‘Reine Claude Verte’.

Transgenic plants expressing higher levels of FT flowered and produced fruits in the greenhouse within 1 to 10 months. FT plums did not enter dormancy after cold or short day treatments yet field planted FT plums remained winter hardy down to at least - 10 °C. The plants also displayed pleiotropic phenotypes atypical for plum including shrub-type growth habit and panicle flower architecture. The flowering and fruiting phenotype was found to be continuous in the greenhouse but limited to spring and fall in the field. The pattern of flowering in the field correlated with lower daily temperatures. This apparent temperature effect was subsequently confirmed in growth chamber studies. The pleitropic phenotypes associated with FT 1 expression in plum suggests a fundamental role of this gene in plant growth and development. This study demonstrates the potential for a single transgene event to markedly affect the vegetative and reproductive growth and development of an economically important temperate woody perennial crop.

This work aims to develop simple-sequence repeat (SSR) or microsatellite markers in almond and Japanese plum, the only two diploid Prunus species lacking these markers when this thesis began, and to study their variability {{in a collection of}} cultivars of each species. In addition, we studied the transferability of the microsatellites obtained from Prunus in other cultivated rosaceous species, including six Prunus species, and three other genus: apple (Malus x domestica), pear (Pyrus comunis) and octoploid strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa). To develop new microsatellite markers, we used two methods: one from enriched DNA genomic library (for sequences CT/AG), for which we obtained 31 SSRs in almond and 27 in Japanese plum, and another using the available sequences of ESTs (expressed sequence tags) of almond (22 SSRs) and peach (25 SSRs). All these microsatellites were polymorphic in a set of eight cultivars of their respective species. We used the obtained markers in an extensive collection of almond varieties (30) to study their genetic variability using 47 microsatellites derived from this species (25 genomic and 22 derived from ESTs). A similar study was conducted in 38 varieties of Japanese plum with 27 genomic SSRs obtained in this species. These markers were highly variable in both species, with an average of 7. 3 alleles per locus in almond and 7. 2 in Japanese plum, allowing us to distinguish individually all the studied genotypes. Our data indicated that the SSRs of the same species are more variable than those developed in other related species. In addition, in almond we found that the microsatellites derived from ESTs, and particularly those located in coding regions, were less variable than those obtained from genomic sequence. The grouping of the studied varieties in function of their genetic distance (dendrogram) or their population structure was quite similar both in almond and Japanese plum. The almond varieties were grouped by their geographical origin and their flowering time, whereas the Japanese plum varieties, of recent origin and largely developed in the United States, were clustered according to the breeding programs of the different States they were obtained. A total of 145 Prunus SSRs [25 genomic from almond, peach and Japanese plum, 25 ESTs derived from peach, 22 ESTs derived from almond and 23 derived from apricot (10 genomic and 13 from ESTs) ] were chosen to study transferability, all polymorphic and identifying a single locus in the origin species. These microsatellites were studied in eight varieties of the following nine species: almond, peach, <b>European</b> <b>plum,</b> Japanese plum, apricot, sweet cherry, apple, pear and strawberry. Eighty-three percent (83 %) of these markers amplified bands of the expected size in the other Prunus species and 63. 9 % were polymorphic, indicating the high transferability within this genus. This transferability decreased as the genetic distance between the species origin of the SSR and the studied species increased. Thus, only 16. 3 % of the tested SSRs were transferable to species of other rosaceous genera (apple, pear and strawberry). No significant differences were detected between microsatellites of different origins (genomic and ESTs) regarding their transferability, nor their capacity to detect variability. From the studied SSRs, 31 amplified and were polymorphic in all tested Prunus species. Twelve, selected to cover the whole genome, were proposed as the universal set for the analysis of variability in Prunus...|$|R
40|$|Background: Small ribonucleic acids {{represent}} an important repertoire of mobile molecules that exert key roles in several cell processes including antiviral defense. Small RNA based repertoire includes both small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) molecules. In the Prunus genus, sharka disease, {{caused by the}} Plum pox virus (PPV), first occurred on <b>European</b> <b>plum</b> (Prunus domestica) and then spread over among all species in this genus and thus classified as quarantine pathogen. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) {{was used for the}} study of siRNA/miRNA molecules; however, NGS relies on adequate extraction protocols. Currently, knowledge of PPV-Prunus interactions in terms of siRNA populations and miRNA species is still scarce, and siRNA/miRNA extraction protocols are limited to species such as peach, almond, and sweet cherry. Results: We describe a reliable procedure for siRNA/miRNA purification from Prunus salicina trees, in which previously used protocols did not allow adequate purification. The procedure was based on a combination of commercially available RNA purification kits and specific steps that yielded high quality purifications. The resulting molecules were adequate for library construction and NGS, leading {{to the development of a}} pipeline for analysis of both siRNAs and miRNAs in the PPV–P. salicina interactions. Results showed that PPV infection led to altered siRNA profiles in Japanese plum as characterized by decreased 24 -nt and increased 21 - and 22 -nt siRNAs. Infections showed miR 164 and miR 160 generation and increased miR 166, miR 171, miR 168, miR 319, miR 157, and miR 159. Conclusion: We propose this protocol as a reliable and reproducible small RNA isolation procedure for P. salicina and other Prunus species...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenolic}} compounds of ?Green Gage? (GG) plums (Prunus domestica L.), ?Rainha Cla?udia Verde?, from a ?protected designation of origin? (PDO), in Portugal, were quantified in both flesh and skin tissues of plums collected {{in two different}} orchards (GG-V and GG-C). Analyzes of {{phenolic compounds}} were also performed on another GG <b>European</b> <b>plum</b> obtained in France (GG-F) and two other French plums, ?Mirabelle? (M) and ?Golden Japan? (GJ). Thiolysis {{was used for the}} first time in the analysis of plum phenolic compounds. This methodology showed that the flesh and skin contain a large proportion of flavan- 3 -ols, which account, respectively, for 92 and 85 % in GJ, 61 and 44 % in GG-V, 62 and 48 % in GG-C, 54 and 27 % in M, and 45 and 37 % in GG-F. Terminal units of procyanidins observed in plums are mainly (+) -catechin (54 ? 77 % of all terminal units in flesh and 57 ? 81 % in skin). The GJ plums showed a phenolic composition different from all of the others, with a lower content of chlorogenic acid isomers and the presence of A-type procyanidins as dimers and terminal residues of polymerized forms. The average degree of polymerization (DPn) of plum procyanidins was higher in the flesh (5 ? 9 units) than in the skin (4 ? 6 units). Procyanidin B 7 was observed in the flesh of all GG plums and in the skin of the Portuguese ones. Principal component analysis of the phenolic composition of the flesh and skin of these plums obtained after thiolysis allowed their distinction according to the variety and origin, opening the possibility of the use of phenolic composition for variety/origin identification...|$|R
