Peterson, who got his first flattop <b>haircut</b> in 1952, hired three barbers to give haircuts {{on the floor of}} his showrooms. They gave about 50 haircuts the first day, and Peterson decided to make the gimmick a weekly event. He continued offering the haircuts for two decades and as of 2002 was still giving away about ten haircuts per week.|$|E

40|$|Regulators {{aiming to}} ward off the next {{financial}} market failure need to implement rules to smooth the boom-bust cycle in margin requirements and <b>haircuts</b> used in securities financing and derivative transactions, which seriously exacerbated the last financial crisis. In this study, the author argues that key elements in a system-wide regulatory framework should include rules to mitigate swings between loose terms for margins and <b>haircuts</b> in boom times, and tightened terms during busts. Longworth emphasizes “through-the-cycle” <b>haircuts</b> and initial margins, the potential use of add-ons to <b>haircuts</b> and margins by macroprudential authorities, and market practices that are less procyclical than they were before and during the crisis.

They are also considering putting a floor under calculations, at least on risky assets that exhibit pro-cyclicality.

5|$|Iceland {{elected a}} new {{government}} in April 2013, which {{as one of their}} top priorities wanted to negotiate a debt <b>haircut</b> towards foreign creditors of the three failed Icelandic banks now in receivership, as part of a deal to lift the long enforced (since November 2008) capital controls. The current capital controls ban a swap/exchange of ISK denominated assets to foreign currency, and so by effect has trapped repayment of ISK denominated assets to the creditors – which in theory mean they should be interested to accept a <b>haircut</b> in return for getting the capital controls lifted. The Icelandic government intent somehow to route the saved money from the negotiated debt <b>haircut</b> for creditors into a national household debt relief fund, enabling a 20% debt relief for all household mortgages. In July 2013, Standard & Poors recommended Iceland to drop the debt relief initiative, as it would only result in increased debt for the government – making it even more difficult to lend at credit markets, and it was forecasted also to ignite high inflation along with an economic recession equal to a GDP detraction of 10%. The government has nevertheless appointed a taskforce to present proposals on how best to achieve the government's goal about implementing a combined capital control abolition and debt relief for households, with a reporting deadline in October 2013. Capital controls were eventually ended in March 2017.|$|E

We find average <b>haircuts</b> ranging from 13 percent (Uruguay external exchange) to 73 percent (2005 Argentina exchange). We also find within-exchange variations in <b>haircuts,</b> depending on the instrument tendered. With exceptions, domestic residents do not appear to have been treated systematically better (or worse) than foreign residents. ...|$|R

5|$|Her {{most infamous}} antic was giving Ozy a <b>haircut</b> only to accidentally shave off all his fur. Although she is {{normally}} manic, {{she also has}} a strong sense of justice, facing the inexplicable wrongs of life and the world she sees. However, her rebellions are mostly limited to annoying her mother, playing jokes on Ozy and disrupting the peace at school. None of which matters any less to her, as long as she has fun doing it. Millie says aloud what others think, and does what others, for fear of reaction from the people around them, would not dare. She, like Ozy, often tries to answer the most important questions in life, but her method of finding the answers makes her unique.|$|E
5|$|In a {{marathon}} meeting on 20/21 February 2012 the Eurogroup {{agreed with the}} IMF and the Institute of International Finance on the final conditions of the second bailout package worth €130 billion. The lenders agreed to increase the nominal <b>haircut</b> from 50% to 53.5%. EU Member States agreed to an additional retroactive lowering of the interest rates of the Greek Loan Facility {{to a level of}} just 150 basis points above Euribor. Furthermore, governments of Member States where central banks currently hold Greek government bonds in their investment portfolio commit to pass on to Greece an amount equal to any future income until 2020. Altogether this should bring down Greece's debt to between 117% and 120.5% of GDP by 2020.|$|E
