5|$|Back in the present, Tina <b>explains</b> <b>in</b> {{her letter}} to her {{daughter}} Anjali Khanna that Rahul always said that love is friendship, and without friendship {{there can be no}} love. Rahul is a single parent and lacks a friend in his life, so Tina gives her daughter the mission of reuniting Rahul with Anjali and bringing back Rahul's lost love and friend. The next day, Rahul, Anjali Khanna and his mom head to Faridabad where they meet Mr. Malhotra for Tina's death anniversary, where Anjali shows them, except for Rahul, her mother's letters..|$|E
5|$|François Callebout {{wrote an}} organ version that was {{published}} in 2004 by Dr. J. Butz. Gabriel Dessauer <b>explains</b> <b>in</b> the preface that the work was conceived for oratorio choirs {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century, of up to 500 singers. The organ version enables smaller choirs to perform the music. It was premiered in 2003 by the Reger-Chor in St. Bonifatius, Wiesbaden, the parish to which the composer belonged during his studies in Wiesbaden. The organ was played by Ignace Michiels, organist at the St. Salvator Cathedral in Bruges.|$|E
5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article <b>explains</b> <b>in</b> detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E

At the same time, frequency of happening of accidents also increasing alarmingly. Also one cannot avoid health care and should take proper health checks in hospitals periodically.

5|$|Only {{three people}} were {{involved}} in the production of Daicon III, Hideaki Anno, Hiroyuki Yamaga and Takami Akai. Takeda, who {{was a part of the}} group, <b>explains</b> <b>in</b> Notenki Memoirs that Anno knew how to make anime, but he never worked with animation cels. They were referred to Animepolis Pero, an anime hobby store chain, but they found that the cost of the cels were too expensive, so a single cel was purchased and taken to a vinyl manufacturer in east Osaka, where they purchased a roll for 2000 yen. After cutting and preparing the vinyl cels, they discovered that the painted cels would stick together when stacked and dry paint would peel off the cels. To keep costs low, they made their own tap to punch holes in the B5 animation paper used in the production.|$|E
5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson <b>explains</b> <b>in</b> her article “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - {{like many other}} black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{knowledge}} of medieval mining techniques comes from books such as Biringuccio’s De la pirotechnia and probably most importantly from Georg Agricola's De re metallica (1556). These books detail many different mining methods used in German and Saxon mines. A prime issue in medieval mines, which Agricola <b>explains</b> <b>in</b> detail, was the removal of water from mining shafts. As miners dug deeper to access new veins, flooding became a very real obstacle. The mining industry became dramatically more efficient and prosperous with the invention of mechanical and animal driven pumps.|$|E
25|$|Many critics {{tied the}} album's {{conceptual}} roots with its sound; it {{was described as}} “ a sense of creeping voyeurism”. Some noted, though, that this notion is ‘subverted’ by the album's sound. As Mike Diver of Drowned in Sound <b>explains</b> <b>in</b> a glowing review, “ a misleading title; nothing terrifying emerges from the multiple layers of sound. Indeed, as far as Isis records go, this is positively joyous”. Similarly, its feel, likened to contemporaries Pelican's 2005 record The Fire in Our Throats Will Beckon the Thaw, is described by Andrew Bonazelli as ‘triumphant’.|$|E
