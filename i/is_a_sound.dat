5|$|Horses {{are subject}} to equine {{recurrent}} laryngeal neuropathy, a disease of the axons of the recurrent laryngeal nerves. The cause is not known, although a genetic predisposition is suspected. The length of the nerve is a factor since it {{is more common in}} larger horses, and the left side is affected almost exclusively. As the nerve cells die, there is a progressive paralysis of the larynx, causing the airway to collapse. The common presentation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound,</b> ranging from a musical whistle to a harsh roar or heaving gasping noise (stertorous), accompanied by worsening performance. The condition is incurable, but surgery can keep the airway open. Experiments with nerve grafts have been tried.|$|E

5|$|The {{stranding}} of the Northern bottlenose whale mainly {{happens in}} two {{villages in the}} northern part of Suðuroy: Hvalba and Sandvík. It is believed that it happens because of a navigation problem of the whale, because there are isthmuses on these places, where the distance between the east and west coasts are short, around one kilometer or so. And for some reason it seems like the bottlenose whale want to take a short cut through what it thinks <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound,</b> and too late it discovers, that is on shallow ground and is unable to turn around again. It happened on 30 August 2012, when two Northern bottlenose whales swam ashore to the gorge Sigmundsgjógv in Sandvík. Two men who were working on the harbour noticed these whales, and some time later they had either died by themselves or were killed by the locals and then cut up for food for the people of Sandvík and Hvalba (Hvalba municipality).|$|E

Énée {{interpret}}s this {{as a sign of}} the goddess Athene's anger at the sacrilege. Against Cassandre's futile protests, Priam orders the horse to be brought within the city of Troy and placed next to the temple of Pallas Athene. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> of what seems to be the clashing of arms from within the horse, but the Trojans, in their delusion, interpret it as a happy omen. Cassandre has watched the procession in despair, and as the act ends, resigns herself to death beneath the walls of Troy.|$|E

25|$|A {{balanced}} armature <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> transducer design primarily {{intended to}} increase the electrical efficiency of the element by eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic transducer systems. As shown schematically in the first diagram, it consists of a moving magnetic armature that is pivoted so it can move {{in the field of}} the permanent magnet. When precisely centered in the magnetic field there is no net force on the armature, hence the term 'balanced.' As illustrated in the second diagram, when there is electric current through the coil, it magnetizes the armature {{one way or the other}}, causing it to rotate slightly one way or the other about the pivot thus moving the diaphragm to make sound.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{pelvic floor}} {{exercises}} and anal sphincter exercises in FI is poorly determined. While {{there may be}} some benefit they appear less useful than implanted sacral nerve stimulators. These exercises aim to increase the strength of the pelvic floor muscles (mainly levator ani). The anal sphincters are not technically part of the pelvic floor muscle group, but the EAS is a voluntary, striated muscle which therefore can be strengthened in a similar manner. It has not been established whether pelvic floor exercises can be distinguished from anal sphincter exercises in practice by the people doing them. This kind of exercise is more commonly used to treat urinary incontinence, for which there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> evidence base for effectiveness. More rarely are they used in FI. The effect of anal sphincter exercises are variously stated as an increase in the strength, speed or endurance of voluntary contraction (EAS).|$|E

Following this experience, Ogboh {{paid attention to the}} interaction of sounds in Lagos as compositions rather than individual voices. Ogboh compared the soundscapes to orchestra symphonies, with layered voices rather than strictly chaotic noise. He also appreciated the soundscape's ability to [...] "transport the listener" [...] and found the sound medium most engaging.|$|E

500|$|... "Voices of Old People" [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> collage, and was {{recorded}} on tape by Garfunkel at the United Home for Aged Hebrews and the California Home for the Aged at Reseda. The collection of audio {{recordings of the}} elderly find them musing on treasured photographs, illness and living conditions. In [...] "Old Friends", the title generally conveys the introduction or ending of sections through repetition, and the song builds upon a [...] "rather loose formal structure" [...] that at first includes an acoustic guitar and soft mood. An additional element is introduced midway through the track: an orchestral arrangement conducted by Jimmie Haskell, dominated by strings and xylophone notes. Horns and other instruments are added when the duo cease singing, creating a turbulence that builds to a single high, sustained note on the strings. The song then segues into the final song of side one, the reprise of the [...] "Bookends Theme".|$|E
500|$|A {{favorable}} review from musicOMH's Daniel Paton described Vol. 3s [...] "unpredictable {{and challenging}} but frequently awe-inspiring terrain" [...] {{and gave the}} album four-and-a-half stars out of five. No Ripcord reviewer Stephen Wragg was less impressed, rating it a seven out of ten, but offered that the album was [...] "stacked with jaw-dropping moments, underpinned by seismic emotional shifts." [...] Mark Richardson, writing for Pitchfork Media, awarded Vol. 3 8.1 out of 10.0 and noted Stetson’s [...] "impressive achievement" [...] before concluding that [...] "the result <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> that could come only from one person on earth." [...] Spin magazine's Richard Gehr described the music as [...] "peerless at conveying isolation, loneliness, and alienation" [...] and scored the album eight out of ten. Rob Young of The Wire praised the album's [...] "extraordinary aural illusionism", noting that Stetson's playing technique finds [...] "timbres in the saxophone's tubing that are rarely brought out." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening track, [...] "Contract on the World Love Jam", <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> collage {{made up of}} samples, scratch cuts, and snippets {{recorded}} by Chuck D from radio stations and sound bites of interviews and commercials. The tension-building track introduces the album's dense, sample-based production. According to Chuck D, the song features [...] "about forty-five to fifty [...] voices" [...] that interweave {{as part of an}} assertive sonic collage and underscore the album’s themes. [...] "Incident at 66.6 FM", another collage that segues into [...] "Welcome to the Terrordome", contains snippets from a radio call-in show interview of Chuck D and alludes to the media persecution perceived by Public Enemy. [...] "Burn Hollywood Burn" [...] assails the use of black stereotypes in movies, and [...] "Who Stole the Soul?" [...] condemns the record industry's exploitation of black recording artists and calls for reparations. [...] "Revolutionary Generation" [...] celebrates the strength and endurance of black women with lyrics related to black feminism, an unfamiliar topic in hip hop. It also addresses sexism within the black community and misogyny in hip hop culture.|$|E
