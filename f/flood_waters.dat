5|$|An unusually {{heavy rain}} storm {{affected}} a GO train on July 8, 2013, when a record-breaking 123mm fell {{over a few}} hours. A Richmond Hill-bound GO train encountered <b>flood</b> <b>waters</b> in the Don Valley and stopped. As the crew worked to change {{the direction of the}} train, <b>flood</b> <b>waters</b> continued to rise and submerged the tracks behind the train. The train itself began to flood, and approximately 1,400 passengers had to be rescued by boat.|$|E

5|$|<b>Flood</b> <b>waters</b> {{from the}} Murchison River {{finally began to}} recede on 17 March; however, it took several weeks for the river to return to its normal level. Although Emma had only minor effects in Carnarvon, the town enacted a A$14million ($10million USD) flood {{protection}} plan {{in the wake of}} the storm. The plan would lead to the construction of new levees in areas surrounding the town and keep <b>flood</b> <b>waters</b> within Nicol Bay Flats. Additionally, four sections of the North West Coastal Highway were set to be upgraded for similar reasons. Due to the combined effects of Cyclones Clare, Darryl, Jim, Emma, Kate and Glenda, gold production in Australia fell by 8 percent, resulting in earnings losses of A$130million.|$|E

30|$|Increased tidal {{asymmetry}} {{coupled with}} wetland topography facilitated the inorganic and organic material export from Lower Beaver Pond {{in the interior}} of the wetland. During flood tide, high flows pushed water up and into the elevated region in the northern quadrat of Lower Beaver Pond. As the <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> receded, it left a pool of water that was isolated from the rest of Lower Beaver Pond by a sill, which prevented the pooled <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> from fully draining during ebb tide. The pooled <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> facilitated accumulation of inorganic material and the growth and accumulation of organic material. The pooled <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> and its accumulated inorganic and organic material was released back into the wetland during the next <b>flood</b> tide, when <b>water</b> was again pushed into the northern end of the pond and partially drained back into the wetland during ebb. The release of this pooled <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> back into the wetland produced a 40 % increase in the organic and inorganic material export from Lower Beaver Pond on ebb tide. Most of the material flux also occurred on ebb tide for freshwater tidal bayous in the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana and freshwater tidal wetlands off the Hudson River (Stern et al. 1991; Arrigoni et al. 2008).|$|R

40|$|Water {{pollution}} {{associated with}} flooding {{is one of}} the major problems in cities in the global South. However, studies of water quality dynamics during flood events are not often reported in literature, probably due to difficult conditions for sampling during <b>flood</b> events. <b>Water</b> quality parameters in open water (canals, rivers, and lakes), <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> on roads and water in sewers have been monitored during the extreme fluvial flood event on 7 October 2013 in the city of Can Tho, Vietnam. This is the pioneering study of urban <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> pollution in real time in Vietnam. The results showed that water quality is very dynamic during flooding, especially at the beginning of the event. In addition, it was observed that the pathogen and contaminant levels in the <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> are almost as high as in sewers. The findings show that population exposed to <b>flood</b> <b>water</b> runs a health risk that is nearly equal to that of being in contact with sewer water. Therefore, the people of Can Tho not only face physical risk due to flooding, but are also exposed to health risks...|$|R

5|$|At Brooklyn, {{still an}} {{independent}} city from New York, houses were dismantled and uprooted trees blocked streets.

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the catastrophic flooding in Monterrey, an appeal {{was made to}} the United States and other nations for aid. Many residents and visitors in the city did all they could to help rescue those trapped in the <b>flood</b> <b>waters</b> {{and take care of}} the homeless. According to the New York Times, one person rescued 30 people stranded in <b>flood</b> <b>waters.</b> Numerous rescue operations were undertaken during the flood, saving many lives. However, survivors faced another issue after losing their homes: lack of food. Food was unavailable to most residents in the wake of the storm until August31 when the first relief supplies arrived. Even then, most only received a small amount of bread and beans. Once the flood along the Santa Catarina River receded, searches were conducted to attempt to locate the bodies of victims. However, reports indicated that the river bed was similar to quicksand and most bodies on it were likely underground.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the center}} of the storm {{remained}} offshore, outer rainbands led to heavy rainfall that triggered substantial flooding. In Michoacán, Dalila flooded ten municipalities with at least 15in (380mm) of precipitation, destroying dozens of wooden structures.
