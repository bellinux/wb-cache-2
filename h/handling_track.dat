The tests will consist of steady state and transient response determination. Modern instrumentation techniques which enable the vehicle accelerations, roll angle, and rate of turn to be recorded provide a means of measuring both steady state and transient responses. A portable 'handling' unit with lateral accelerometer, fore and aft accelerometer, roll position gyroscope, and yaw velocity gyroscope, together with a film or tape recorder, is a perfectly practical proposition...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how steering assistance should scale with steering wheel size. A method {{has been developed}} to scale complete torque felt by the driver, both for continuous and discontinuous feedback. This was used in an experiment with 17 subjects all driving a truck with three differently sized steering wheels. The test took place on a <b>handling</b> <b>track</b> at 45 – 90 km/h. Continuous feedback was evaluated subjectively; discontinuous feedback by measuring angular response. Results show that torque feedback should decrease as steering wheel size decreases. A {{rule of thumb is}} to keep driver force level constant to maintain perceived handling and comfort. This also maintained the average steering wheel angle change response to discontinuous assistance. Furthermore large variance in angular response was observed. The direction, measured 0. 25 s after start of a pulse, was {{the same as that of}} the pulse applied in 88 % of the recordings...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} thesis is to propose a modification of the track geometry parameters and a complete reconstruction of the railway superstructure and substructure on the route Krnov (Hanušovice) - Olomouc on the section from km 36. 6 to km 39. 6 {{in the pursuit of}} minimalization of the displacement of the rail grid compared to the current situation. There is a loading station and the Nový Malín railway station in the track, where it is necessary to find a new location for the platform due to the reconstruction. This must meet the requirements for access for people with limited mobility, according to regulation No. 398 / 2009 Sb. The reconstruction will also affect the <b>handling</b> <b>track</b> and the turnouts in loading station in Nový Malín.

40|$|A {{ground vehicle}} {{is a dynamic}} system {{containing}} many non-linear components, ranging from the non-linear engine response to the tyre-road interface. In pursuit of developing driver-assist systems for accident avoidance, as well as fully autonomous vehicles, the application of modern mechatronics systems to vehicles are widely investigated. Extensive {{work has been done}} in an attempt to model and control the lateral response of the vehicle system utilising a wide variety of conventional control and intelligent systems theory. The majority of driver models are however intended for low speed applications where the vehicle dynamics are fairly linear. This study proposes the use of adaptive control strategies as robust driver models capable of steering the vehicle without explicit knowledge of vehicle parameters. A Model Predictive Controller (MPC), self-tuning regulator and Linear Quadratic Self-Tuning Regulator (LQSTR) updated through the use of an Auto Regression with eXogenous input (ARX) model that describes the relation between the vehicle steering angle and yaw rate are considered as solutions. The strategies are evaluated by performing a double lane change in simulation using a validated full vehicle model in MSC ADAMS and comparing the maximum stable speed and lateral offset from the required path. It is found that all the adaptive controllers are able to successfully steer the vehicle through the manoeuvre with no prior knowledge of the vehicle parameters. An LQSTR proves to be the best adaptive strategy for driver model applications, delivering a stable response well into the non-linear tyre force regime. This controller is implemented on a fully instrumented Land Rover 110 of the Vehicle Dynamics Group at the University of Pretoria fitted with a semi-active spring-damper suspension that can be switched between two discrete setting representing opposite extremes of the desired response namely: ride mode (soft spring and low damping) and handling mode (stiff spring and high damping). The controller yields a stable response through a severe double lane change (DLC) up to the handling limit of the vehicle, safely completing the DLC at a maximum speed of 90 km/h all suspension configurations. The LQSTR also proves to be robust by following the same path for all suspension configurations through the manoeuvre for vehicle speeds up to 75 km/h. Validation is continued by successfully navigating the Gerotek dynamic <b>handling</b> <b>track,</b> as well as by performing a DLC manoeuvre on an off-road terrain. The study successfully developed and validated a driver model that is robust against variations in vehicle parameters and friction coefficients.

40|$|International audienceVehicle {{surrounding}} environment perception {{is an important}} process for many applications. Nowadays, a tendency is to incorporate redundant and complementary sensors into an intelligent vehicle, {{in order to enhance}} its perception ability; then an essential issue arises naturally, i. e. what fusion architecture can be used to combine the data from multiple sensors? In this paper, we propose a new track-totrack fusion architecture using the split covariance intersection filter-information matrix filter (SCIF-IMF). The basic idea is to use the IMF (adapted for estimates in split form) to <b>handle</b> the <b>track</b> temporal correlation of each sensor system and to use the SCIF to <b>handle</b> <b>track</b> spatial correlation. The proposed architecture enjoys complete sensor modularity and thus enables flexible self-adjustment. A simulation based comparative study is presented, which shows that the track-totrack fusion architecture using the SCIF-IMF can achieve centralized architecture comparable performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A state-constrained, robust near-time-optimal {{clamp force}} {{tracking}} controller for an automotive electromechanical brake is presented. The proposed hybrid control structure {{consists of two}} switching control laws that <b>handle</b> <b>tracking</b> of rate-bounded references {{in the presence of}} state constraints. The responsive tracking utilizes an approximated time-optimal switching curve as a sliding manifold, while state constraints are handled by a linearizing–stabilizing feedback controller. The hybrid controller is proven to asymptotically track the reference in the presence of unknown but bounded time-varying disturbances and modelling errors. Implementation and vali-dation of the proposed controller on a prototype electromechanical brake enables favourable per-formance comparisons with existing servo control architectures to be obtained...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{present an}} {{approach}} to laser-based people tracking using a multi-hypothesis tracker that detects and tracks legs separately with Kalman filters, constant velocity motion models, and a multi-hypothesis data association strategy. People are defined as high-level tracks consisting of two legs that are found with little model knowledge. We extend the data association so that it explicitly <b>handles</b> <b>track</b> occlusions in addition to detections and deletions. Additionally, we adapt the corresponding probabilities in a situation-dependent fashion so as to {{reflect the fact that}} legs frequently occlude each other. Experimental results carried out with a mobile robot illustrate that our approach can robustly and efficiently track multiple people even in situations of high levels of occlusion. I...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} deal with the track {{coalescence}} problem of the joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) algorithm, a novel approach from a state bias removal point of view is developed in this paper. The factors that JPDA causes the state bias are analyzed, and the direct computation equation of the bias in the ideal case is given. Then based on the definitions of target detection hypothesis and target-to-target association hypothesis, the bias estimation is extended to the general and practical case. Finally, the estimated bias is removed from the state updated by JPDA to generate the unbiased state. The results of Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed method can <b>handle</b> <b>track</b> coalescence and presents better performance when compared with the traditional methods.|$|R
