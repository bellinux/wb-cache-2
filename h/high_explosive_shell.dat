25|$|After the Continuation War {{ended with}} Moscow Armistice Allied Control Commission demanded that all coastal guns larger than 120mm in calibre east of Porkkala {{had to be}} removed and placed in storage. This {{included}} the coastal fortifications around Porkkala, fortifications of the capital Helsinki (18 152mm guns) and the Kotka-Hamina area forts (17 152/45 C guns). This restriction was lifted in 1947 after signing of the Paris Peace Treaty. 152/45 C guns were badly worn out after the war, and several had cracked or broken barrels. An investigation of the barrel failures concluded that the guns could not withstand the pressures created by the gunpowder used. This led to a development of a new light weight <b>high</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>shell</b> which could be fired by a half-charge of gunpowder. The worn out gun barrels were replaced with newly developed 50 caliber 152 50 Tampella barrels.|$|E
