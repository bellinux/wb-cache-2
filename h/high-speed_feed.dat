It directly influences the contouring accuracy of the CNC machines. Usually position loop gain is experimentally tuned on the already assembled CNC machines. This paper gives one approach towards its analytical calculation. The difference between analytical calculated and experimentally obtained Kv-factor is smaller than 5 %, which is completely acceptable...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Owning to the <b>high-speed</b> <b>feed</b> {{rate and}} ultra spindle speed {{have been used}} in modern machine tools, the tool-path {{generation}} {{plays a key role in}} the successful application of a High-Speed Machining (HSM) system. Because of its importance in both high-speed machining and tool-path generation, approximating a contour by NURBS format is a potential function in CAD/CAM/CNC systems. It is much more convenient to represent an ellipse by parametric form than to connect points laboriously determined in a CNC system. A new approximating method based on optimum processes and NURBS curves of any degree to the ellipses is presented in this study. Such operations can be the foundation of tool-radius compensation interpolator of NURBS curves in CNC system. All operating processes for a CAD tool is presented and demonstrated by practical models.

40|$|Abstract. According to the {{requirements}} of <b>high-speed</b> machining, the <b>feed</b> rate control algorithm based on the acceleration-deceleration control and dynamics conditions is proposed. This algorithm not only satisfies the continuity of displacement, feed rate, acceleration and jerk of the feed movement, but also meets the dynamics condition of high-speed machining. Furthermore, the algorithm is applied to NURBS curve interpolation and optimizes the acceleration-deceleration intervals. At last, the algorithm is verified by simulation. This interpolation algorithm of feed rate control reduces the impact, machine vibration of feed, and improves the surface accuracy and quality of high-speed machining...|$|R
40|$|Higher {{productivity}} requires high-speed {{motion of}} machine tool axes. The iron core linear DC motor (LDM) is widely {{accepted as a}} viable candidate for <b>high-speed</b> machine tool <b>feed</b> unit. LDM, however, has two inherent disturbance force components, namely cogging and thrust force ripple. These disturbance forces directly affect the tracking accuracy of the feeding system and must be eliminated or reduced. In order to reduce motor ripple, this research adapted the feedforward compensation method and neural network control. Experiments carried out with the linear motor test setup show that these control methods are effective in reducing motor ripple...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—High-performance {{position}} control algorithms for multi-axis servo-systems, due to presence of asymmetric dy-namics and disturbance, do not guarantee high-precision con-touring. Cross-Coupling Control (CCC) conventionally uses a static Contour Error Estimate (CEE) {{to reduce the}} shortest distance between the reference map and actual position, known as contour error. However, reliability of the static CEE de-teriorates for <b>high-speed</b> reference <b>feeds</b> and also for sharp corners and deep curves. We propose a dynamic CEE using a Newton-based update law to obtain a precise CEE for fast and highly-curved contours. The Newton-based algorithm uses {{an estimate of the}} contour error curvature in order to eliminate the convergence dependence on the contour shape. The proposed CCC design includes one PID controller per axis, and combines the proposed Newton-based CEE with Integral Sliding Mode Control (ISMC) which is well-known for its capability in dealing with parameter uncertainty and external disturbances. The proposed ISMC performance is enhanced with an adaptive disturbance estimate. The proposed CCC algorithm reduces the time-averaged contour error (TACE) at least by an order of magnitude in comparison to conventional CCC algorithms. Various simulation results are presented to highlight the significant improvement achieved by the proposed algorithm. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on the transit-time delay of a loose-tube-type single-mode optical-fiber cable is investigated experimentally. A 1058 -m length of cable was placed loosely coiled in an oven {{and used to}} connect a 820 -nm single-mode laser diode to a <b>high-speed</b> avalanche-photodiode detector <b>feeding</b> a vector voltmeter; the signal was provided by a high-stability frequency-synthesized generator. Measurements were made every 2 C from - 50 to 60 C and compared to those obtained with a 200 -m lacquered bare fiber. The phase change of both fibers varied with temperature at a positive slope of 6 - 7 ppm/C. This value is significantly better than those reported for other cable types, suggesting the application of loose-fiber cables to long-haul gigabit digital transmissions or precision time-base distribution for VLBI...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} design the feed system of high speed Computer Numerical Control (CNC) lathe, the static and dynamic {{characteristics}} of feed system driven by linear motor in high speed CNC lathe were analyzed. The slide board was taking as the main moving part of the feed system, and the guide rail was the main support component of the linear motor feed system. The mechanical structure static stiffness of feed system is researched through the slide board statics analysis. The simulation {{results show that the}} maximum deformation of the slide board occurs {{in the middle of the}} slide board where the linear motor is placed. The linear motor feed system control model was established based on analysis of <b>high-speed</b> linear <b>feed</b> system control principle, and the linear motor feed system transfer function was established, and servo dynamic stiffness factors were analyzed. The control parameters of the servo system and actuating mechanism parameters of feed system on the effect of the linear motor servo dynamic stiffness were analyzed using MATLAB software. The simulation results show that the position loop proportional gain, speed loop proportional gain and speed loop integral response time are the biggest influence factors on servo dynamic stiffness. The displacement response is reduced under the cutting interference force step inputting, the servo dynamic stiffness is increased, the number of system oscillation is also reduced, and the system tends to be stable.   </p...|$|R
40|$|Inertial suction feeding is {{the most}} common method of prey capture among aquatic vertebrates. However, it had been unclear whether the aquatic frogs in the family Pipidae also used {{inertial}} suction for prey capture. In this study, we examined feeding behavior in four species of pipids, Pipa pipa, Xenopus laevis, Hymenochirus boettgeri and Pseudhymenochirus merlini. Pressure in the buccopharyngeal cavity was measured during prey capture. These pressure measurements were coupled with <b>high-speed</b> recordings of <b>feeding</b> behavior. For each species, the internal buccopharyngeal pressure was found to drop significantly below ambient pressure, and changes in pressure corresponded with the onset of mouth opening. Kinematic analysis revealed that all species of pipids generated subambient pressure during prey capture; H. boettgeri and P. merlini relied solely on inertial suction feeding. Pipa pipa and X. laevis additionally employed forelimb scooping during prey capture but both of these species demonstrated the ability to capture prey with inertial suction alone. Based on buccopharyngeal pressure measurements as well as kinematic analyses, we conclude that inertial suction feeding is used during prey capture in these four species of pipids...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinematics}} of prey capture by the chamaeleonid lizard Chamaeleo oustaleti {{were studied}} using <b>high-speed</b> cinematography. Three <b>feeding</b> sequences {{from each of}} two individuals were analyzed for strike distances of 20 and 35 cm, at 30 °C. Ten distances and angles were measured from sequential frames beginning approximately 0. 5 s prior to tongue projection and continuing for about 1. 0 s. Sixteen additional variables, documenting maximum excursions and the timing of events, were calculated from the kinematic profiles. Quantified descriptions of head, hyoid and tongue movements are presented. Previously unrecognized rapid protraction of the hyobranchial skeleton simultaneously {{with the onset of}} tongue projection was documented and it is proposed that this assists the accelerator muscle in powering tongue projection. Acceleration of the tongue occurred in about 20 ms, reaching a maximum acceleration of 486 m s~ 2 and maximum velocity of 5. 8 m s" 1 in 35 cm strikes. Deceleration of the tongue usually began within 5 ms before prey contract and the direction of tongue movement was reversed within 10 ms of prey contact. Retraction of the tongue, caused by shortening of th...|$|R
40|$|While {{the use of}} accelerometers in {{the aquatic}} {{environment}} becomes an increasingly used tool in remotely observing animals; however, the data obtained from deploying accelerometers still needs better understanding. Observations gathered by studies using accelerometers are largely limited to the identification of simple behaviours such as resting and swimming, yet fine-scale movements such as feeding and escape responses are mostly undetected. In this experiment, we aim to establish a link between acceleration traces and fast-start movements in the Great Sculpin (M. polyacanthocephalus) by the analysis of acceleration data from accelerometers and a <b>high-speed</b> video camera. <b>Feeding</b> events, escape events and spontaneous movements were triggered and observed using a 100 Hz recording accelerometer (Little Leonardo Ltd, Japan) and a high-speed video camera for n = 7 great sculpin. Kinematic comparison between acceleration obtained from accelerometers and high-speed video camera were performed using vector transformation, yet prove to be difficult {{due to differences in}} reference frames and different sources of error. To establish a link between behaviour and acceleration, statistical analysis shows that the signature of spontaneous events can be described by the variation of the magnitude of acceleration which is significantly lower in spontaneous events compared to fast-start movements. Most of this information is lost (50 %) if the accelerometer sampling rate is lower than 30 Hz. Furthermore, two parameters (the value of Amax the variation of acceleration in lateral and forward direction) allow us to differentiate between escape events and feeding events. These results are a valuable contribution to understanding acceleration data in the field and the issues associated with low sampling rates. ...|$|R
40|$|Billfishes are {{considered}} among the fastest swimmers in the oceans. Despite early estimates of extremely high speeds, more recent work showed that these predators (e. g., blue marlin) {{spend most of their}} time swimming slowly, rarely exceeding 2 m s(- 1). Predator-prey interactions provide a context within which one may expect maximal speeds both by predators and prey. Beyond speed, however, an important component determining the outcome of predator-prey encounters is unsteady swimming (i. e., turning and accelerating). Although large predators are faster than their small prey, the latter show higher performance in unsteady swimming. To contrast the evading behaviors of their highly maneuverable prey, sailfish and other large aquatic predators possess morphological adaptations, such as elongated bills, which can be moved more rapidly than the whole body itself, facilitating capture of the prey. Therefore, it is an open question whether such supposedly very fast swimmers do use <b>high-speed</b> bursts when <b>feeding</b> on evasive prey, in addition to using their bill for slashing prey. Here, we measured the swimming behavior of sailfish by using high-frequency accelerometry and high-speed video observations during predator-prey interactions. These measurements allowed analyses of tail beat frequencies to estimate swimming speeds. Our results suggest that sailfish burst at speeds of about 7 m s(- 1) and do not exceed swimming speeds of 10 m s(- 1) during predator-prey interactions. These speeds are much lower than previous estimates. In addition, the oscillations of the bill during swimming with, and without, extension of the dorsal fin (i. e., the sail) were measured. We suggest that extension of the dorsal fin may allow sailfish to improve the control of the bill and minimize its yaw, hence preventing disturbance of the prey. Therefore, sailfish, like other large predators, may rely mainly on accuracy of movement and the use of the extensions of their bodies, rather than resorting to top speeds when hunting evasive prey...|$|R
