Set in 1940's Italy, the entire set was designed {{to look like a}} giant bed, in which Sly has his dream of a tattooed Petruchio attempted to woo a drinking, smoking, irreverent Katherina. Dillon delivered Katherina's final speech with heavy irony, but the production left little <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a strong sexual chemistry between herself and Petruchio.|$|E
25|$|However, {{collaboration}} {{is not the}} whole story. While there is little <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were strong antisemitic feelings in Belgium, after November 1942, the German roundups became less successful as large-scale rescue operations were carried out by ordinary Belgians. This resulted in the survival of about 25,000 Jews from Belgium. Unlike other states, which were immediately annexed, Belgium was initially placed under German military administration, which the Belgian authorities exploited by refusing to carry {{out some of the}} Nazi directives against the Jews. Roughly 60 percent of Belgium's Jews, who were there {{at the start of the}} war, survived the Final Solution.|$|E
25|$|Carrier {{argues in}} his book On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for <b>Doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is {{insufficient}} Bayesian probability, that is evidence, {{to believe in the}} existence of Jesus. Furthermore, Carrier argues that the Jesus figure was probably originally known only through private revelations and hidden messages in scripture which were then crafted into a historical figure to communicate the claims of the gospels allegorically. These allegories then started to be believed as fact during the struggle for control of the Christian churches of the first century. He argues that the probability of Jesus' existence is somewhere in the range from 1/3 to 1/12000 depending on the estimates used for the computation.|$|E

500|$|... "By {{the time}} of the film's release in 1939, there was some {{question}} as to who should receive screen credit," [...] writes Yeck. [...] "But despite the number of writers and changes, the final script was remarkably close to Howard's version. The fact that Howard's name alone appears on the credits may have been as much a gesture to his memory as to his writing, for in 1939 Sidney Howard died at age 48 in a farm-tractor accident, and before the movie's premiere." [...] Selznick, in a memo written in October 1939, discussed the film's writing credits: [...] "ou can say frankly that of the comparatively small amount of material in the picture which is not from the book, most is my own personally, and the only original lines of dialog which are not my own are a few from Sidney Howard and a few from Ben Hecht and a couple more from John Van Druten. Offhand I <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are ten original words of [...] Garrett's in the whole script. As to construction, this is about eighty per cent my own, and the rest divided between Jo Swerling and Sidney Howard, with Hecht having contributed materially to the construction of one sequence." ...|$|E
500|$|Fuller was {{an early}} proponent of {{feminism}} and especially believed in providing education to women. Once equal educational rights were afforded women, she believed, women could push for equal political rights as well. She advocated that women seek any employment they wish, rather than catering to the stereotypical [...] "feminine" [...] roles of the time, such as teaching. She once said, [...] "If you ask me what office women should fill, I reply—any... let them be sea captains if you will. I do not <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are women well fitted for such an office". She had great confidence in all women but doubted that a woman would produce a lasting work of art or literature in her time and disliked the popular female poets of her time. Fuller also warned women {{to be careful about}} marriage and not to become dependent on their husbands. As she wrote, [...] "I wish woman to live, first for God's sake. Then she will not make an imperfect man for her god, and thus sink to idolatry. Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty". By 1832, she had made a personal commitment to stay single. Fuller also questioned a definitive line between male and female: [...] "There is no wholly masculine man... no purely feminine" [...] but that both were present in any individual. She suggested also that within a female were two parts: the intellectual side (which she called the Minerva) and the [...] "lyrical" [...] or [...] "Femality" [...] side (the Muse). She admired the work of Emanuel Swedenborg, who believed men and women shared [...] "an angelic ministry", as she wrote, as well as Charles Fourier, who placed [...] "Woman on an entire equality with Man". Unlike several contemporary women writers, including [...] "Mrs. Sigourney" [...] and [...] "Mrs. Stowe", she was familiarly referred to in a less formal manner as [...] "Margaret".|$|E
500|$|Amongst British composers, Sir Harrison Birtwistle readily {{acknowledges}} {{the influence of}} Stockhausen's Zeitmaße (especially on his two wind quintets, Refrains and Choruses and Five Distances) and Gruppen on his work more generally ( [...] ; [...] ). Brian Ferneyhough says that, although the [...] "technical and speculative innovations" [...] of Klavierstücke I–IV, Kreuzspiel and Kontra-Punkte escaped him on first encounter , they nevertheless produced a [...] "sharp emotion, {{the result of a}} beneficial shock engendered by their boldness" [...] and provided [...] "an important source of motivation (rather than of imitation) for my own investigations" [...] While still in school, he became fascinated upon hearing the British première of Gruppen, and listened many times to the recording of this performance, while trying to penetrate its secrets—how it always seemed to be about to explode, but managed nevertheless to escape unscathed in its core—but scarcely managed to grasp it. Retrospectively, it is clear that from this confusion was born my interest for the formal questions which remain until today. [...] With respect to Stockhausen's later work, he said, I have never subscribed (whatever the inevitable personal distance) to the thesis according to which the many transformations of vocabulary characterizing Stockhausen's development are the obvious sign of his inability to carry out the early vision of strict order that he had in his youth. On the contrary, {{it seems to me that}} the constant reconsideration of his premises has led to the maintenance of a remarkably tough thread of historical consciousness which will become clearer with time[...] [...] [...] I <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> has been a single composer of the intervening generation who, even if for a short time, did not see the world of music differently thanks to the work of Stockhausen. [...] In a short essay describing Stockhausen's influence on his own work, Richard Barrett concludes that [...] "Stockhausen remains the composer whose next work I look forward most to hearing, apart from myself of course" [...] and names as works that have had particular impact on his musical thinking Mantra, Gruppen, Carré, Klavierstück X, Inori, and Jubiläum [...]|$|E
