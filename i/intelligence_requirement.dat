40|$|Terrorism {{is not a}} new {{phenomenon}} to the world, yet it remains difficult to define and to counter. Countering terrorism requires several measures that must be taken at the same time. Counterterrorism strategies of most countries depend on military measures. However, those strategies should also focus on nonlethal measures, such as economic, political, and social measures. The psychological dimensions of terrorism must be understood, evaluated, and used in countering terrorism. This study suggests that psychological operations, as nonlethal military operations, can be used to influence individuals not to join terrorist organizations and to facilitate defections from terrorist organizations. However, in order to implement effective psychological operations, one has to have appropriate intelligence about terrorist organizations. Examining terrorist organizations helps us to identify their vulnerabilities and obtain this intelligence. This thesis concludes that terrorists' motivations, terrorist organizations' radicalization, recruitment, and conversion processes, ideology, goals, strategies, and general structure form the <b>intelligence</b> <b>requirement</b> for psychological operations in counterterrorism. This study also examines the terrorist organization, al-Qaeda, to show its vulnerabilities. Turkish Air Force author...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. This thesis formulates and evaluates a {{mathematical}} model from an engineer's point of view based on the currently-known information-processing processes and structures of biological neurons. The specification and evaluation of the RealNeuron model form a baseline for current use in engineering solutions and future developments. The RealNeuron is a carefully-reduced model that retains the essential features of more complex models. A systems engineering approach is used to formulate it, i. e. the model is described as using multiple resolution levels with configurable modular elements at each resolution level and is then implemented, verified and validated in a bottom-up method. It is computationally efficient and only adds or subtracts ion concentrations based on the states at the membrane structure's level. The results are integrated at {{the lower levels of}} resolution. The RealNeuron's simple calculations make simulations on personal computers possible by using standard spreadsheet software for a seven-neuron classical-conditioning neural circuit. All the simulated states at the highest level of resolution (i. e. pumps, channels, etc.), the intermediate levels of resolution (i. e. membrane potentials, neurotransmitters in the synapse, etc.) and the lowest level of resolution (i. e. conditioning signal, conditioned signal, conditioned reaction, etc.) are available on a spreadsheet. The RealNeuron is verified in a bottom-up manner. The pumps, channels and receptors are verified first. These components are then integrated into the different membrane types (post-synaptic membrane, main membrane, axonal membrane) and verified while the membrane components are validated simultaneously. This process is repeated until individual neurons have been built up and RealNeuron networks have finally been constructed. The RealNeuron is verified and validated in configurations for AND, NAND, OR, NOR, NOT and XOR logic functions. It is also verified and validated by the implementation of classical conditioning. In a noisy environment, the RealNeuron's performance is dependent on the pump's parameters in the main membrane of the sensor neurons. This thesis proposes that a grade of machine intelligence is used to distinguish between the different synthesis requirements for intelligent machines. An engineering synthesis of a RealNeuron network, based on classical conditioning, demonstrates how to implement a RealNeuron network {{that can be used in}} machines built to the grade of machine <b>intelligence</b> <b>requirement</b> which is classical-conditioning learning implemented with neural networks that can change learned associations in a dynamic environment.

Despite the volumes of material {{written on the}} conduct of counterinsurgency operations, little work has examined what intelligence is required to provide national policymakers with {{the information they need}} to make good decisions governing counterinsurgency. This thesis first reviews the problems experienced in Afghanistan with the collection and dissemination of intelligence from ground units to the national policymakers. It then takes a look at intelligence process doctrine encapsulated in service manuals of the U. S. Army and U. S. Marine Corps, as well as joint service intelligence doctrine, and determines that priority <b>intelligence</b> <b>requirements</b> are not being properly articulated to obtain the answers policymakers require. After a review of counterinsurgency doctrine and theories, this thesis proposes three priority <b>intelligence</b> <b>requirements</b> for use in counterinsurgency operations. These three <b>intelligence</b> <b>requirements</b> focus on: 1) supporting operations that attack the insurgencys support infrastructure; 2) identify host-nation government personnel or institutions that are not effectively supporting counterinsurgency policy; and 3) revealing how the insurgency is undermining popular support for the government. This thesis identifies a way to get the answers to those priority <b>intelligence</b> <b>requirements</b> from the ground units to the policymakers in a usable form. Major, United States Arm...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{objective of this}} thesis is to evaluate the operational intelligence apparatus that exists to support the U. S. Marine Corps' tactical warfighting commander. The questions that drive such an analysis are: what are the fundamental uniformities of operations? What are the <b>intelligence</b> <b>requirements</b> for the most likely conflict? What is the intelligence architecture? What are the problems of intelligence support? What are the near- term and long-term remedies for intelligence support in these most likely conflicts? Based on the recurring <b>intelligence</b> <b>requirements</b> of historical antecedents, the thesis focuses {{on the lack of}} an integrated and complete intelligence architecture that supports the warfighting commander. This encompasses a lack of operational connectivity of intelligence within the larger command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, and interoperability (C 4 I 2) system/architecture. One utility of this thesis is in isolating the prevalent, realistic, operational and <b>intelligence</b> <b>requirements</b> for the employment of Marines. Another is in expanding the concept of a Marine Corps intelligence architecture.
