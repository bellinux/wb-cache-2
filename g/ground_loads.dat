Parameters to be measured include vertical and horizontal movement of the wall face, local movements or deterioration of facing elements, drainage to the <b>ground,</b> <b>loads,</b> load distribution and load changes in the nails, temperature and rainfall.

5000|$|For aircraft, loading {{is divided}} into two major categories: limit loads and {{ultimate}} loads. Limit loads are the maximum loads a component or structure may carry safely. Ultimate loads are the limit loads times a factor of 1.5 or the point beyond which the component or structure will fail. Gust loads are determined statistically and are provided by an agency such as the Federal Aviation Administration. Crash loads are loosely bounded by the ability of structures to survive the deceleration of a major ground [...] Other loads that may be critical are pressure loads (for pressurized, high-altitude aircraft) and <b>ground</b> <b>loads.</b> Loads on the ground can be from adverse braking or maneuvering during taxiing. Aircraft are constantly subjected to cyclic loading. These cyclic loads can cause metal fatigue.|$|E
50|$|One {{potential}} {{disadvantage of}} the grid leak detector is that the input impedance of the detector may {{be affected by the}} need to self bias the detector tube with grid current. Having the grid leak resistor, even in the Megohm range, shunting signal to <b>ground</b> <b>loads</b> the received signal. Although this may be mitigated to some degree by taking the resistor {{to the top of the}} tuned circuit (i.e. in parallel with the capacitor) and through the coil to earth, or by circuit design and component optimization, forward grid current will still load the input signal (and reduce the Q of the tuned circuit). Plate detectors have the advantage in that they isolate the detector load from the input circuit more effectively and may be employed where sensitivity is thought to be otherwise compromised by a grid leak or diode detector circuit.|$|E

Single Amplifier Current Sources, published in Analog Dialogue, Volume 1, Number 1, 1967, introduces several current source circuits that provide a constant current through floating <b>loads</b> or <b>grounded</b> <b>loads.</b> In industrial applications, such as pressure transmitters and gas detectors, these circuits are widely used to provide 4 -mA to 20 -mA or 0 -mA to 20 -mA currents.

40|$|Alteration of <b>ground</b> snow <b>loads</b> due to {{the climate}} change may {{significantly}} impact the reliability of existing structures, as well as design Codes for new ones. In the paper a novel technique for snow load map refinement is proposed where <b>ground</b> snow <b>loads</b> derived starting from gridded climate data provided by climate models are combined with observed point measurements of snow loads and then suitably updated. First, an a priori random field of characteristic <b>ground</b> snow <b>loads</b> at the sea level is deduced from the analysis of gridded climate data. This prior random field is discretized by the truncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion, to separate the spatial and the stochastic domain and to reduce the dimension of the problem. The distribution of the resulting standard normal random variables are then updated incorporating point measurements of <b>ground</b> snow <b>loads</b> collected {{in the past and}} using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to sample the posterior.
