5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Krichell focused on Ivy League pitchers, saying he {{preferred}} signing pitchers who could think. From Harvard University, he signed Charlie Devens later saying <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> great had {{he continued to}} play baseball, and from Yale University, he scouted pitcher Johnny Broaca {{who seemed to be}} heading for stardom after winning 12 games in his first three seasons with the Yankees, but suddenly retired to become a professional boxer. In 1935, a local scout who worked with Krichell placed Long Island University pitcher Marius Russo in a semi-professional team. When Krichell deemed Russo ready, he signed with the Yankees for $750, twice becoming a 14-game winner and being an All-Star in 1941 before injuring his arm. Other Krichell signings from this period included Johnny Murphy, Hank Borowy and Johnny Allen. Murphy, a relief pitcher and four time saves leader, was signed while still in high school in the Bronx and at Krichell's behest, the Yankees followed Murphy's education at Fordham University, where he gained baseball experience. Krichell signed Borowy from Fordham University for $8,500 and the player later became the ace for the Yankees during the wartime era. Krichell supposedly discovered Allen by a chance encounter when Allen worked as a desk clerk at a Sanford hotel. The story said he recognized Krichell as a scout, told him that he was a pitcher, and that he wanted to try out. Krichell agreed, and impressed by Allen's ability, signed him to a minor league contract. However, in an interview with J. G. Taylor Spink of The Sporting News, Krichell said while he signed Allen, he did not discover him.|$|E
5|$|In {{what was}} seen to have {{promoted}} anti-incumbency, a scandal regarding campaign finance followed allegation that the Centre Party's Timo Kalli's, who was also {{the head of the}} party's parliamentary group, admission in early May 2009 that he violated the law on reporting electoral campaign financing by not disclosing financial contributions he received for his election campaign during the previous election in 2007. When the media then delved further into the issue, stories started to emerge of common practice with a multitude of MPs not disclosing their financial benefactors, a practice which was not punishable under Finnish law. The media investigations focused on a group of entrepreneurs called Kehittyvien Maakuntien Suomi (Finland of Developing Provinces) who financed the electoral campaigns of numerous high-profile government and opposition candidates. Further investigations revealed that many recipients of their financial support did not register or even mention the amounts they received from the group. Then Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen was {{at the core of the}} accusations after the investigations showed he had also been among the beneficiaries of the groups' financing; this was despite one of the members of the group who had planned to build the biggest shopping mall in the country received Vanhanen's support for the plans against the grain of public opinion, thus eliciting accusations that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> influenced by the individual. Blame was also put on the Centre Party's secretary Jarmo Korhonen. This was said to have helped the True Finns.|$|E
5|$|Kilner {{began the}} 1920 season with an innings of 206 not {{out in his}} first match, against Derbyshire, and the effort {{remained}} the highest score of his career. He batted for four hours, hitting 24 fours and two sixes. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> caught when he had scored around fifty, but a local newspaper described the innings as brilliant, his driving and pulling being particularly effective. Kilner appeared in one representative match: at the end-of-season Scarborough Festival, he played for CI Thornton's XI against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side which visited Australia in the winter—at the time, the MCC administered English cricket, and the England team toured under its name. In total, he scored 1,316 runs {{at an average of}} 37.09 with two more centuries, placing him second in the Yorkshire averages. With the ball, he took 27 wickets but his average of 25.33 was relatively high. The county finished fourth in the Championship as Middlesex were crowned winners. Critics believed Kilner should have bowled more frequently, an opinion shared by Wilfred Rhodes, Yorkshire's main slow left-arm spinner. Conscious of his increasing age, the 42-year-old Rhodes wanted support with the bowling workload; he considered Kilner the best option and encouraged him to improve his left-arm spin. Consequently, during the winter, Kilner practised bowling in the yard of the Wombwell hotel where his father was landlord. Around the same time he celebrated the birth of his second son, named Major after Major Booth.|$|E

5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry and hot weather. Michael Schumacher clinched his ninth pole position of the season, his second at the circuit, with a time of 1:37.397. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Häkkinen who recorded a lap time 0.463 seconds slower than the pole sitter. Coulthard qualified third and suffered a worrying moment when a fire on his McLaren caused petrol to seep into his eye and admitted the incident could have escalated if not dealt with quickly. Barrichello, who was still suffering from flu, qualified fourth having been pushed from second position in the closing seconds of the session. Wurz qualified fifth, in his best qualifying performance of the season. Villeneuve secured the sixth fastest time despite having to walk to the pit lane when his BAR's engine was turned off on his final run. Irvine made changes to his set-up and secured seventh although he believed <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> quicker as he backed off through turn 15. Ralf Schumacher lost four-tenths of a second on his fastest lap and managed eighth. Trulli and Frentzen rounded out the top ten qualifying positions for Jordan. Zonta missed qualifying in the top ten by two-tenths of a second and lost time with a braking issue. Herbert, in his final Formula One race, qualified twelfth and struggled with understeer following an engine change. He was ahead of Fisichella, de la Rosa and Verstappen. Jenson Button qualified 16th and encountered traffic during the session which prevented him from setting a faster lap time. The Sauber, Prost and Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid, covering positions 17 to 22.|$|E
25|$|Luckily for Giles, he was {{fortunate}} enough to not be overshadowed by his younger (slightly less funny) brother Nigel Reynolds. Nigel is full of tall tales of how talented a cricketer he was, and how successful <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pengiran Seri Lela died in August–September 1578, {{probably}} {{from the same}} illness that had afflicted his Spanish allies, although there was suspicion <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> poisoned by the ruling Sultan.

25|$|Greenidge {{began his}} career as a cricketer within County Cricket of which was prior to him playing for Barbados. He thus played for many seasons with Hampshire in the English County Championship, where he batted as an opener with Barry Richards. As so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> called up to feature for England. With such he went on to make an {{appearance}} for Scotland. As a whole in his first class career, he scored 37,000 runs with 92 centuries altogether.|$|E
25|$|He could {{back his}} batting with slow medium-pacers that swung alarmingly when the {{conditions}} favoured him. On the 1977 tour of England he showed in an ODI at Edgbaston that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{well suited to}} the burgeoning genre of one-day cricket when he snared five for 18. However, Cosier’s bowling was not really used in Tests and his first Test wicket did not come until his 13th match. He was also an excellent close-in fielder and secure slipper.|$|E

It is possible {{that he was a}} usurper who seized the throne during a time of crisis and political unrest, or <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a member of a minor line of the Ramesside royal family who emerged as pharaoh.

6000|$|Perhaps I am biased in my doubt {{concerning}} {{the usefulness of}} his persistence in re-writing, by my regret that he destroyed {{so many of his}} romances, as not worthy of him. [...] "King's chaff is better than other folk's corn" [...] says our proverb. In his day, I bored him by pressing him to write more, and more rapidly; <b>he</b> never <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> commonplace, <b>he</b> never <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> less than excellent.

Nicole enters into an affair with Tommy Barban. Nicole divorces Dick and marries Barban.|$|E
