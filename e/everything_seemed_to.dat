25|$|At the EuroBasket 1999, Alvertis {{seemed ready}} to lead Greece to its first medal since 1989. After leading the team in offense, with 18.1 points per game in the {{qualifying}} round, <b>everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> indicate a great EuroBasket for the Greek star. Nevertheless, misfortune {{is part of the}} game of basketball. A few days before the tournament, Alvertis suffered a severe injury during practice. This injury made him not only miss the EuroBasket, but also the major part of the Panathinaikos 1999–2000 season. Without its offensive leader, and also without Nikos Oikonomou and Efthimios Rentzias, who were also injured, Greece finished in an embarrassing sixteenth and last position. Greece failed to qualify for the 2000 Summer Olympics of course, and was doomed to two years of exclusion from every major tournament.|$|E

500|$|Stanley Donen {{was born}} in Columbia, South Carolina to Mordecai Moses Donen, a dress-shop manager, and Helen (Cohen), the {{daughter}} of a jewelry salesman. His younger sister Carla Donen Davis {{was born in}} August 1937. Although born to Jewish parents, he became an atheist in his youth. Donen described his childhood as lonely and unhappy {{as one of the few}} Jews in Columbia, and he was occasionally bullied by anti-semitic classmates at school. To help cope with his isolation, he spent much of his youth in local movie theaters and was especially fond of Westerns, comedies and thrillers. The film that had the strongest impact on him was the 1933 Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musical Flying Down to Rio. Donen said that he [...] "must have seen the picture thirty or forty times. I was transported into some sort of fantasy world where <b>everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be happy, comfortable, easy and supported. A sense of well-being filled me." [...] He shot and screened home movies with an 8 mm camera and projector that his father bought for him.|$|E

500|$|The Rutherford {{government}} {{had just been}} resoundingly re-elected in the 1909 provincial election, winning 36 of the legislature's 41 seats, when the new legislature first met in February 1910. [...] There was initially no sign of controversy {{in relation to the}} A Railway: William Clarke, A President, had several months earlier announced that the line would be completed by the end of 1912, ahead of schedule. [...] When the A bonds went on sale in London in November 1909, the issue was oversubscribed. [...] The following month, the contract for ties was awarded. [...] <b>Everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be progressing as planned when, {{at the beginning of the}} new legislative session, Liberal backbencher John R. Boyle asked the government a series of innocuous questions about the company and the guarantees made to it. [...] Rutherford, Minister of Railways as well as Premier, responded to the questions in writing. [...] Before he did so, however, a rumour began to circulate that William Henry Cushing, Minister of Public Works, had resigned from the cabinet.|$|E
500|$|The opening song, [...] "And It Stoned Me", {{was written}} about {{feelings}} of ecstasy received from witnessing and experiencing nature, in a narrative describing a rural setting with a county fair and mountain stream. Morrison said he based it on a quasi-mystical experience he {{had as a}} 12 year old fishing in the Comber village of Ballystockart, where he once asked for water from {{an old man who}} said he had retrieved it from a stream. [...] "We drank some and <b>everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> stop for me", the singer recalled, adding that it induced a momentary feeling of quietude in him. According to Hinton, these childhood images foreshadowed both spiritual redemption and—in Morrison's reference to [...] "" [...] in the chorus—sexual pleasure. AllMusic's Tom Maginnis argued that the singer was instead likening the experience to the first time hearing jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton. The largely acoustic title track featured piano, guitar, saxophone, electric bass, and a flute over-dub backing Morrison, who sang of an adult romance set in Autumn and imitated a saxophone with his voice near the song's conclusion. [...] "This is a rock musician singing jazz, not a jazz singer, though the music itself has a jazz swing", Hinton remarked, noting how its rhythm is played in triplets rather than rock's archetypical quadruple time signature. [...] "Crazy Love" [...] was recorded with Morrison's voice so close to the microphone that it captured the click of Morrison's tongue hitting the roof of his mouth as he sang. He sings in falsetto, producing what Hinton felt was a sense of intense intimacy, backed by a female chorus.|$|E
500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik was hugely {{successful}} upon its release on September 24, 1991. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard charts, {{and went on to}} sell thirteen million copies worldwide. The unexpected success instantly turned the Red Hot Chili Peppers into rock stars. Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame, and struggled to cope with it. Soon after the album's release, he began to develop a dislike for the band's popularity. Kiedis recalled that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts: [...] "John would say, 'We're too popular. I don't need to be at this level of success. I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago.'" [...] Frusciante later said that the band's rise to popularity was [...] "too high, too far, too soon. <b>Everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be happening at once and I just couldn't cope with it." [...] He also began to feel that destiny was leading him away from the band. When the Chili Peppers began their world tour, he started to hear voices in his head telling him [...] "you won't make it during the tour, you have to go now." [...] Frusciante admitted to having once taken great pleasure in hedonism; however, [...] "by the age of twenty, I started doing it right and looking at it as an artistic expression instead of a way of partying and screwing a bunch of girls. To balance it out, I had to be extra-humble, extra-anti-rock star." [...] He refused to take the stage during a performance at Tokyo's Club Quattro on May 7, 1992, telling his bandmates that he was leaving the band. He was persuaded to perform, but left for California the next morning; according to the guitarist, [...] "it was just impossible for me to stay in the band any longer. It had come to the point where even though they wanted me in the band, it felt like I was forced out of the band. Not by any members in particular or management in particular, but just the direction it was going." [...] He was replaced by former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.|$|E

But when the film was made and shown around, it was considered {{too good to be}} confined to half an hour.

2500|$|In an era {{of civil}} unrest and {{political}} change, Maxwell Street Market thrived as a multicultural phenomenon. At the Market there was no Black, Brown, White, or Yellow. The only color was Green. Cash was king. [...] Each culture and [...] "group" [...] respected and honored the other and mostly interacted outside what were then current national issues. This milieu of culture and ethnicity was a distinctly American phenomenon; Maxwell Street {{has been called the}} Ellis Island of the Midwest. Local politics had an interest in the market's audience. Election time often brought many placards and signs (some billboard-like). <b>Everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> work and run as a well-oiled machine. [...] "Spot-holders" [...] (allegedly of mob influence) roamed the streets and interacted with vendors to maintain regular vending sites for which unobtrusive cash payments were accepted.

2500|$|In North America, {{especially}} {{the first half}} of this period, people experienced considerable prosperity in the Roaring Twenties. The social and societal upheaval known as the Roaring Twenties began in North America and spread to Europe in the aftermath of World War I. The Roaring Twenties, often called [...] "The Jazz Age", saw an exposition of social, artistic, and cultural dynamism. 'Normalcy' returned to politics, jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined modern womanhood, Art Deco peaked. The spirit of the Roaring Twenties was marked by a general feeling of discontinuity associated with modernity, a break with traditions. <b>Everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be feasible through modern technology. New technologies, especially automobiles, movies and radio proliferated 'modernity' to a large part of the population. The 1920s saw the general favor of practicality, in architecture as well as in daily life. The 1920s was further distinguished by several inventions and discoveries, extensive industrial growth and the rise in consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in lifestyle.|$|E
2500|$|Cross {{played for}} the St Kilda Saints in Australia as a batsman in the 2008/09 season. He won the prestigious Jack Ryder Medal, {{presented}} to the Player of the Year in the Victorian Premier League. During his stint with the club, Cross scored 541runs {{at an average of}} 41, with a highest score of 111. Although primarily a batsman, Cross occasionally bowled, taking six wickets with best figures of 4/41. He was surprised to receive the award, and said that [...] "This was my fourth spell with St Kilda and each time I've thoroughly enjoyed my cricket. I set myself a challenge this winter of focusing on my batting, improving my technique and doing my best for the club. <b>Everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> click and I was very happy with my own performance and that of the team. My focus now is to continue to do well during Lancashire’s pre-season fixtures, and push for first team selection." [...] Despite his promising winter, Cross was less successful in the 2009 season than desired: he did not play any first-class cricket and scored fewer runs in the one-day competitions than hoped. However, Cross captained Lancashire's secondXI and was a regular in their top order. Under his leadership, the team progressed to the final of the Second XI Championship and the semi-final of the SecondXI Trophy.|$|E
