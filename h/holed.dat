40|$|Spring-back is a {{phenomenon}} that occurs during metal forming processes. It occurs from the elastic recovery during unloading. Spring-back effect of perforated commercial pure Aluminium sheet is investigated in this work. Perforated sheet metals performance is influenced by percentage of open area, number of <b>holes,</b> ligamentratio, <b>hole</b> size, <b>hole</b> shape, arrangement of <b>hole</b> pattern and thickness. Among the above, the influences of <b>hole</b> size, <b>hole</b> shape and <b>hole</b> arrangement pattern are considered in this paper. Sheet metal V-bending process is modeled using Finite Element Method. It {{has been found that}} spring-back decreases when <b>hole</b> size increases. Sheets with square <b>holes</b> exhibit more spring-back than that of circular <b>holes.</b> Spring-back of sheets with <b>holes</b> arranged in triangular pattern is less than that of <b>holes</b> arranged in square pattern...|$|R

5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the <b>holed</b> module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{two-dimensional}} discrete element program (UDEC) {{is applied}} to simulate the dampi-ng effect of empty <b>holes</b> on blasting vibration. The {{results show that the}} peak particle velocity of monitoring point on the condition that there are empty <b>holes</b> between monitoring point and blast <b>hole</b> is less than that without empty <b>holes.</b> The factors which have impact on cushioning effect, such as the depth of empty <b>hole,</b> the diameter of empty <b>hole,</b> the distance between empty <b>hole</b> and blast <b>hole</b> and the rows of empty <b>hole,</b> are investigated numerically. It is found that the depth of empty <b>hole</b> has dominated influence on the damping effect and the damping effect on blasting vibration strengthens with the increment of the depth. The diameter of empty <b>hole</b> and the distance between empty <b>hole</b> and blast <b>hole</b> have slight influence on the damping effect. The increment of rows of empty <b>hole</b> can enhance the damping effect on blasting vibration as well. The results in the present study may provide a reference for the application of empty <b>hole</b> to reduce the blasting vibration in practical engineering...|$|R

5|$|Another noted shipwreck, {{that of the}} Surat, {{occurred}} on New Year's Day in 1874. This ship, <b>holed</b> on rocks near Chasland's Mistake eight kilometres southeast of Tautuku Peninsula, limped {{as far as the}} mouth of the Catlins River before its 271immigrants abandoned ship. A beach {{at the mouth of the}} Catlins River is named Surat Bay in commemoration of this wreck. The schooner Wallace and steamer Otago were also both wrecked at or near Chasland's Mistake, in 1866 and 1876 respectively, and a 4534-ton steamer, the Manuka, ran aground at Long Point north of Tautuku in 1929. In all there were eight shipwrecks of note between 1839 and 1892.|$|E
5|$|Arafat {{was finally}} {{allowed to leave}} his {{compound}} on 2 May 2002 after intense negotiations led to a settlement: six PFLP militants, including the organization's secretary-general Ahmad Sa'adat, wanted by Israel, who had been <b>holed</b> up with Arafat in his compound, would be transferred to international custody in Jericho. After the wanted men were handed over the siege was lifted. With that, and a promise that he would issue {{a call to the}} Palestinians to halt attacks on Israelis, Arafat was released. He issued such a call on 8 May. On 19 September 2002, the IDF largely demolished the compound with armored bulldozers in order to isolate Arafat. In March 2003, Arafat ceded his post as Prime Minister to Mahmoud Abbas amid pressures by the US.|$|E
5|$|In February 1915, Agamemnon {{was ordered}} to {{participate}} in the Dardanelles Campaign. She departed Portland on 9 February, and joined the British Dardanelles Squadron at Mudros 10 days later. That was {{the second day of the}} opening bombardment of the Ottoman Turkish forts guarding the entrance to the Dardanelles and the ship immediately joined the attack. She also took part in the subsequent bombardment of the inner forts later in February. Agamemnon was hit by seven 240-millimetre (9.4-inch) shells in ten minutes on 25 February and was <b>holed</b> above the waterline, suffering three dead.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A “clean ” black <b>hole</b> {{is a black}} <b>hole</b> in vacuum such as the Schwarzschild black <b>hole.</b> However in real {{physical}} systems, {{there are}} matter fields around a black <b>hole.</b> Such a black <b>hole</b> is called a “dirty black hole”. In this paper, the effect of matter fields on the black <b>hole</b> and the greybody factor is investigated. The results show that matter fields make a black <b>hole</b> smaller. They can increase the potential energy to a black <b>hole</b> to obstruct Hawking radiation to propagate. This causes the greybody factor of a dirty black <b>hole</b> {{to be less than}} that of a clean black <b>hole...</b>|$|R

50|$|A blind <b>hole</b> {{refers to}} a <b>hole</b> that is reamed, drilled, or milled to a {{specified}} depth without breaking through {{to the other side}} of the workpiece. The etymology is that it is not possible to see through a blind <b>hole.</b> Other types of <b>holes</b> also include through <b>holes,</b> and clearance <b>holes.</b> In this instance blind may also refer to any feature that is taken to a specific depth, more specifically referring to internally threaded <b>hole</b> (tapped <b>holes).</b> Not considering the drill point, the depth of the blind <b>hole,</b> conventionally, may be slightly deeper than that of the threaded depth.|$|R
5|$|In early November 1822, the {{schooner}} USS Alligator, {{under the}} command of Lieutenant Allen, put into Matanzas, Cuba, intending to patrol the area as part of the United States Navy's West Indian Anti-Piracy Campaign. Upon arriving at the port, Allen discovered two Americans attempting to raise $7,000 in order to pay a ransom to a band of pirates that had captured their vessels. If the ransom was not delivered, the pirates threatened to destroy the ships and rough up their crews. Learning from these men that the pirates were <b>holed</b> up some 15 leagues away, Allen took the civilians aboard and decided to make an attempt at recovering their ship from the buccaneers.|$|E

40|$|Surface {{infrared}} thermography, hotwire anemometry, and thermocouple {{surveys were}} performed on two new film cooling <b>hole</b> geometries: spiral/rifled <b>holes</b> and fluidic sweeping <b>holes.</b> The spiral <b>holes</b> attempt to induce large-scale vorticity to the film cooling jet as it exits the <b>hole</b> to prevent {{the formation of the}} kidney shaped vortices commonly associated with film cooling jets. The fluidic sweeping <b>hole</b> uses a passive in-hole geometry to induce jet sweeping at frequencies that scale with blowing ratios. The spiral <b>hole</b> performance is compared to that of round <b>holes</b> with and without compound angles. The fluidic <b>hole</b> is of the diffusion class of <b>holes</b> and is therefore compared to a 777 <b>hole</b> and Square <b>holes.</b> A patent-pending spiral <b>hole</b> design showed the highest potential of the non-diffusion type <b>hole</b> configurations. Velocity contours and flow temperature were acquired at discreet cross-sections of the downstream flow field. The passive fluidic sweeping <b>hole</b> shows the most uniform cooling distribution but suffers from low span-averaged effectiveness levels due to enhanced mixing. The data was taken at a Reynolds number of 11, 000 based on <b>hole</b> diameter and freestream velocity. Infrared thermography was taken for blowing rations of 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, and 2. 5 at a density ration of 1. 05.

5|$|The Liberty Head nickel {{was heavily}} struck during its 30-year run, except during {{economic}} downturns in 1885–1886 and in 1894, when only small numbers were struck. In 1890, Congress ended {{production of the}} three-cent piece, leaving the five-cent coin as {{the only one in}} copper nickel. That year, Congress also allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the redesign of United States coins, if the former design had been struck for at least 25 years. Although the nickel and silver dollar had been redesigned within the previous quarter-century, a provision in the latter act made them eligible for immediate redesign.

5|$|Coffee shop {{employees}} {{who witnessed the}} shooting identified Clemmons as the shooter {{from a series of}} photos. Authorities sought him in what was considered one of the biggest manhunts the Seattle-Tacoma area had ever seen, and Clemmons was considered the most wanted man in the Pacific Northwest. Authorities also surrounded the homes of Clemmons' friends and family in order to prevent him from finding shelter, and to determine who was helping him. A relative learned that Clemmons was coming to her home in the Leschi neighborhood in Seattle, informed the police and fled. Police locked down the house for 11 hours in the early morning of November 30, believing Clemmons to be <b>holed</b> up inside. After several attempts to coax or force him out of the house, including use of a robot and flashbang grenades, police entered and discovered Clemmons was not inside. Later that day, police searched multiple locations in the Seattle and Tacoma areas, including a park where they found a handgun carried by Clemmons and his pickup truck, which had blood stains inside.|$|E
