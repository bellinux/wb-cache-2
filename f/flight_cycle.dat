2500|$|On April 5, 2011, the FAA {{issued an}} {{emergency}} Airworthiness Directive (AD) requiring operators of 737 series 300, 400 and 500 aircraft {{to increase the}} frequency of inspections of lap joints on high <b>flight</b> <b>cycle</b> airframes. The AD requires that aircraft with over 30,000 cycles be inspected within 20 days of receipt of the AD, or upon reaching 30,000 cycles. For aircraft with over 35,000 cycles, the inspection is required within 5 days. The AD also requires periodic inspections of the same joints at every 500 cycles for aircraft with over 30,000 cycles. The AD refers {{to a range of}} airframes, line numbers 2553–3132 inclusive, totaling 580 aircraft. Of the total of 580 aircraft, only 175 aircraft currently meet the 30,000 cycle requirement, with 80 of those operating in the United States. [...] The FAA AD is effective to only the portion of those that are registered in the United States, since the FAA can only mandate such changes in the United States. Countries with reciprocity airworthiness agreements will also follow the AD, but other nations are not required to adhere to the ruling. As a result of the incident, the FAA investigated Boeing's manufacturing techniques to discover whether or not they had any bearing on the cause of the failure.

The {{major goal}} of the concept was to provide the delivery service with the greatest potential return on investment. The design objectives of the Arrow 227 were based on three parameters; production cost, payload weight, and aerodynamic efficiency. Low production cost helps to reduce initial investment. Increased payload weight allows for a decrease in <b>flight</b> <b>cycles</b> and, therefore, less fuel consumption than an aircraft carrying less payload weight and requiring more <b>flight</b> <b>cycles.</b> In addition, fewer <b>flight</b> <b>cycles</b> will allow a fleet to last longer.

40|$|Copyright © 2014 by ASME. Gas {{turbine engine}} {{components}} {{are subject to}} both lowcycle fatigue (LCF) and high-cycle fatigue (HCF) loads. To improve engine reliability, durability and maintenance, {{it is necessary to}} understand the interaction of LCF and HCF in these components, which can adversely affect the overall life of the engine while they are occurring simultaneously during a <b>flight</b> <b>cycle.</b> A fully coupled aeromechanical fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis in conjunction with a fracture mechanics analysis was numerically performed to predict the effect of representative fluctuating loads on the fatigue life of blisk fan blades. This was achieved by comparing an isolated rotor to a rotor in the presence of upstream inlet guide vanes (IGVs). A fracture mechanics analysis was used to combine the HCF loading spectrum with an LCF loading spectrum from a simplified engine <b>flight</b> <b>cycle</b> {{in order to determine the}} extent of the fatigue life reduction due to the interaction of the HCF and LCF loads occurring simultaneously. The results demonstrate the reduced fatigue life of the blades predicted by a combined loading of HCF and LCF cycles from a crack growth analysis, as compared to the effect of the individual cycles. In addition, the HCF aerodynamic forcing from the IGVs excited a higher natural frequency of vibration of the rotor blade, which was shown to have a detrimental effect on the fatigue life. The findings suggest that FSI, blade-row interaction and HCF/LCF interaction are important considerations when predicting blade life at the design stage of the engine...|$|E
