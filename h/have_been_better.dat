It was the 63rd best-selling video game of 2000 in Japan, with 185,616 copies. The game scored 31 out of 40 in the Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, with the four reviewers highly praising the graphics but feeling that the controls, while not bad, could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> implemented.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April The Guardian {{published}} the American banker's video, and {{later that evening}} handed it to an IPCC investigator and a City of London police officer who arrived at the newspaper's offices. The officers asked that the video {{be removed from the}} website, arguing that it jeopardized their inquiry and was not helpful to the family. Nick Hardwick, chair of the IPCC, said the IPCC had asked The Guardian to remove the video only because it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> had witnesses not seen it before being questioned.|$|E
5|$|The skull was {{generally}} {{similar to that}} of Oryzomys couesi, as were the teeth. It was robust and bore well-developed supraorbital ridges (located above the eyes) on the braincase. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, was small and narrow. The bony palate extended beyond the third molars. The nasal bones extended further back than the premaxillaries, whereas these bones are usually about coterminous in O.couesi. On average, the incisive foramina, which perforate the front part of the palate, were shorter than in O.couesi. The zygomatic arch (cheekbone) appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> developed in O.antillarum.|$|E

5|$|The {{western and}} {{southern}} sides, which {{lie in the}} rain shadow of the central highlands, are home to dry deciduous forests, spiny forests, and deserts and xeric shrublands.

The western coast features many protected harbors, but silting {{is a major problem}} caused by sediment from the high levels of inland erosion carried by rivers crossing the broad western plains.|$|E
5|$|Braid was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} Windows title with possible console versions, though Blow was not committed to releasing either a PC or console version first. Blow signed up with Microsoft to release the game on Xbox Live in mid-2007, with that version officially announced at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show. Blow was critical of the Xbox Live certification process, as he believed the effort to meet all the requirements could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> spent on polishing the game. At the same time, the certification team allowed him to retain certain aspects of his vision for the game that were otherwise contrary to the process, including giving the player immediate control of the game instead of requiring a start-up title screen. Microsoft also requested that Blow include some additional hints to the player based on results of playtesting, but Blow held his ground, refusing to release the game if {{he was forced to}} add these. He said he would likely not release a game again on the Xbox Live service under the same business model. Blow later released a Braid theme for Xbox Live; though he wanted to release this theme for free, Microsoft required the theme to be priced at a nominal level.|$|E
5|$|In June 2013, Dimitri {{received}} an Email from his old friend, and former lover, Brooke English. Brooke {{was shocked when}} Dimitri responded by showing up at her door, {{and told him that}} she thought she'd never see him again. Dimitri revealed that he and Alex had divorced, and that he had not bothered remaining in touch with Edmund's family and had reverted to his reclusive ways, but that Europe was beginning to bore him and her timing couldn't <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better.</b> Upon returning to town, he stopped by his former residence, Wildwind, only to find that the place was empty. Brooke explained that after its last occupant, Caleb Cortlandt, had moved out, Sam and Maddie, Edmund's children, had not bothered to rent the mansion out again. Dimitri told Brooke that, while at Wildwind, he stopped by the mausoleum and made amends to Edmund, who had died in a fire 8 years earlier.|$|E

5|$|In mid-2000 the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) {{invited a}} team from King's College London to conduct a study of East Timor's {{security}} force options. The team's report identified three options for an East Timorese military. Option1 was based on FALINTIL's preference for a relatively large and heavily armed military of 3,000–5,000 personnel, option2 was a force of 1,500 regulars and 1,500 conscripts and option3 was for a force of 1,500 regulars and 1,500 volunteer reservists. The study team recommended option3 as being best suited to East Timor's security needs and economic situation. This recommendation was accepted by UNTAET in September 2000 and {{formed the basis of}} East Timor's defence planning. The plan was also accepted by all the countries that had contributed peacekeeping forces to East Timor. The King's College report has been criticised {{on the grounds that it}} led East Timor to establish a large police force and a large Army when its security needs may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> met by a single smaller paramilitary force.|$|E

5|$|R.C. Pro-Am II was {{developed}} by Rare and published by Tradewest. It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in December1992. Nintendo Power praised the game's controls and upgrade options, which made the game strategic. The magazine criticized the difficulty as unfair, with aircraft hazards that gave players no reaction time in which to dodge attacks. Nintendo Magazine System praised the game overall and its multiplayer in particular, but felt that better games were available. In 1993, GamePro said that the game was better than its predecessor, but noted that the graphics and sound could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better.</b> Jeuxvideo.com appreciated how the sequel's cars had better traction, but thought the game was technically unrefined considering its few advances in four years' time. For example, they criticized Rare for recycling the original game's audio. In 1994, Game Players had high praise for the game's multiplayer, screeching sound effects, vehicle handling, and replay value. They criticized its lack of in-game music and current weapon indicators, and struggled to anticipate turns in the track in the game's angled perspective.|$|E

5|$|The album's {{original}} cover art by Burton Silverman features a watercolour {{portrait of a}} long-haired, bearded man in shabby clothes. The idea for the cover came from a photograph Anderson's wife took of a homeless man on Thames Embankment, and Anderson later felt it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> to have used the photograph rather than commission the painting. Ian Anderson recalls posing for a photograph for the painting, though Silverman claims it was a self-portrait. The artwork was commissioned and purchased by Chrysalis Records head Terry Ellis. Artist Silverman claims the art was only licensed for use as an album cover, and not for merchandising; and approached the band seeking remuneration for its further use. Silverman and Anderson have different accounts of level of enmity involved in this. The original artwork for both {{the front and back}} covers are now privately owned by an unknown family, apparently having been stolen from a London hotel room.|$|E
5|$|The timing {{could not}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> for the Vale Royal community, {{for in a}} storm 19 October 1360 the arcades of the {{unfinished}} nave of their abbey church collapsed, and rebuilding {{could not have been}} funded by the abbey without outside help; even so, their original ambitious plans were never carried out in full. It has been suggested that the transfer was arranged, after the collapse, in order to provide funds for Vale Royal Abbey to repair their church. However the legal formalities, beginning with the appropriation by the feofees, was too soon after the storm to realistically have been in response to that event. Given that the abbey was already – and remained – in debt, the reason for the appropriation was probably related to that. As corporate rector, Vale Royal Abbey was responsible for appointing a vicar and for the care of the chancel, leaving the rest of the church to be maintained by the parish.|$|E
5|$|There {{were five}} of them, a {{somewhat}} exceptional number: William P. Halliday, Samuel B. Halliday, Edwin W. Halliday, Henry L. Halliday, and Thomas W. Halliday. Of them all, I may {{be permitted to}} say that while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct {{that would have given}} them prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said that}} they have always stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly. They pushed their business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> for the city and for them also, I have no doubt.|$|E

5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> off without free will, {{he argued that the}} possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault {{on the part of the}} agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E
