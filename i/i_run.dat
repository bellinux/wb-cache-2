25|$|Over the years, {{many people}} have asked me how <b>I</b> <b>run</b> the Naval Reactors Program, {{so that they might}} find some benefit for their own work. I am always chagrined at the {{tendency}} of people to expect that I have a simple, easy gimmick that makes my program function. Any successful program functions as an integrated whole of many factors. Trying to select one aspect as the key one will not work. Each element depends on all the others.|$|E
25|$|Ford New Zealand's Seaview {{plant in}} Lower Hutt built 1.1 and 1.3-litre versions, {{initially}} as Deluxe (1.1) and Super (1.3) two-door sedans plus panel vans. The four-door sedan was added in 1970. Trim levels were revised after the 1972 UK facelift {{with just one}} run of 1.3XLs (with the GT instrument pack) before these were downgraded to 'L' trim. Base and L trims were offered {{to the end of}} the Mk <b>I</b> <b>run.</b> Some 1.6 Mexicos were imported in 1973–74 after the government temporarily freed up import licensing owing to a shortage of new cars. Estate versions were mostly imported.|$|E
500|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>run</b> down to {{my cabin}} to bring my other clothes, watch and bag but only had {{time to take the}} watch and coat when water with {{enormous}} force came into the cabin and I had to rush up to the deck again where I found my friends standing with lifebelts on and with terror painted on their faces. What should I do now, with no lifebelt and no shoes and no cap? ...|$|E
60|$|Heavens, how <b>I</b> <b>ran!</b> The wind buffeted my {{face and}} buzzed in my nostrils. The rain pringled upon my skin and hissed past my ears. I {{stumbled}} into holes. I tripped over bushes. I fell among brambles. I was torn and breathless and bleeding. My tongue was like leather, my feet like lead, and my heart beating like a kettle-drum. Still <b>I</b> <b>ran,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>ran,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>ran.</b>|$|R
6000|$|But <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> {{no farther}} than the house door, for there <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> head-foremost into a party of {{soldiers}} with their muskets, one of whom held {{out a pair of}} handcuffs to me, saying, [...] "Here you are, look sharp, come on!" ...|$|R
60|$|But you may suppose I paid no heed; jumping, ducking, and {{breaking}} through, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> straight before my nose till <b>I</b> could <b>run</b> no longer.|$|R
500|$|Johnson {{introduced}} a fast-paced style of basketball called [...] "Showtime", {{described as a}} mix of [...] "no-look passes off the fastbreak, pin-point alley-oops from halfcourt, spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through triple teams." [...] Fellow Lakers guard Michael Cooper said, [...] "There {{have been times when}} [...] has thrown passes and I wasn't sure where he was going. Then one of our guys catches the ball and scores, and <b>I</b> <b>run</b> back up the floor convinced that he must've thrown it through somebody." [...] Johnson could dominate a game without scoring, running the offense and distributing the ball with flair. In the 1982 NBA Finals, he was named the Finals MVP averaging just 16.2 points, the lowest average of any Finals MVP award recipient in the three-point shot era.|$|E
500|$|West {{released}} his first album, Blue Cowboy, in 1987. Blue Cowboy is {{an album of}} three original songs and five covers. Chuck Yarborough of the Cleveland Plain Dealer said, [...] "Listening to the first excerpt of his [...] "Blue Cowboy" [...] made me balk—you'll pardon the expression—at listening to the second. But I did. And the third. And so on. And now? Well, if I'm Nashville, <b>I</b> <b>run</b> West outta the game. The Hook. The Heave-Ho. The Thumb." [...] In a September 2012 review, music blog Long After Dark said, [...] "Blue Cowboy easily ranks with Ron Artest and Carl Lewis {{as one of the}} worst albums that a sports figure has cut ... ever. I can say that I managed {{to make it through the}} record, although it was not easy." ...|$|E
500|$|..... And when Michel {{gets his}} strokes of genius and, {{in the video}} for [...] "Army of Me", wants a dentist that's a gorilla to find a diamond in my mouth, some people call it nonsense. But it's {{probably}} the most realistic way of expressing what situation I'm in - all these people trying to take things away from me, and the gorilla finding a diamond that I don't know I have and then stealing it. [...] "Army of Me" [...] is so much about me actually learning that I have to defend myself. I {{have to stand up}} and fight the fucking gorilla. Once I've got the diamond and <b>I</b> <b>run</b> away with it, it becomes massive 'cos it's mine. But if the gorilla had kept it, it would have gone really tiny. That's surrealism for me.|$|E
60|$|MINNIE. One of the Pindar Church and the Other of the Pindar Shops. I guess he'll {{understand}} {{they were from}} me, all right. You see, when <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> away from the Pindar Shops and the Pindar Church--I always connect them together--I was stuck on George. That's why <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Steele and <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> out. There was {{shooting}} everywhere.

500|$|From the mid-1850s, Emily's mother became {{effectively}} bedridden {{with various}} chronic illnesses {{until her death}} in 1882. Writing to a friend in summer 1858, Emily {{said that she would}} visit if she could leave [...] "home, or mother. I do not go out at all, lest father will come and miss me, or miss some little act, which I might forget, should <b>I</b> <b>run</b> away– Mother is much as usual. I Know not what to hope of her". As her mother continued to decline, Dickinson's domestic responsibilities weighed more heavily upon her and she confined herself within the Homestead. Forty years later, Lavinia stated that because their mother was chronically ill, one of the daughters had to remain always with her. Emily took this role as her own, and [...] "finding the life with her books and nature so congenial, continued to live it".|$|E
500|$|Malouma {{announced}} in April 2014 that {{she no longer}} felt she could keep up her political fight for democracy, although she would continue to support cultural and environmental causes. Even so, her Knou lyrics included allusions to her favorite political causes: equality and rights for all, women's place in society, and education for the young, all under threat, as well as environmental protection. Referring to her political role as a senator for the opposition party Assembly of Democratic Forces, in August 2014 she commented: [...] "I use my presence and speaking time in the chamber to extend the effect of my texts and my songs. Whenever <b>I</b> <b>run</b> into ministers or important personalities, I tell them what the people expect of them." [...] She has also continued to speak out about issues such as Palestine and the Iraqi War in her songs. At a press conference on December 16, 2014, Malouma announced she was leaving the opposition and joining the ruling party, the Union for the Republic, {{on the grounds that}} she could participate more effectively in building Mauritania by standing behind the policies of the current leader Aziz.|$|E
500|$|... "Jungle" [...] {{is another}} minor-key track {{featuring}} techno synthesizers, angry lyrics and a sociopolitical theme. Queen raps: [...] "And in this jungle I'm the boss, undoubtedly <b>I</b> <b>run</b> this, you're thirsty, all I want is an adventure." [...] The singer collaborates with Franco [...] "El Gorila" [...] on this track. [...] "Aya Aya" [...] is [...] "an conventional dembow beat, {{flanked by a}} sitar." [...] It also combines the sounds of hip hop and Bollywood music. Its Arabic rhythm {{has been described as}} inviting to dancers by Primera Horas Frances Tirado. [...] "Amor A Primera Vista" [...] (Love At First Sight) is a tropical bachata ballad featuring smooth vocals, electric guitar riffs, piano, synthesizers and hand drums. Its roots are Caribbean, with Afro-Latin influences. Jadiel surfaces around the 1:17 mark; the two explore [...] love's power and how love can be good and bad at the same time. [...] "Dime" [...] (Tell Me) is a blend of reggaeton and bachata (known as bachaton or bachateo), a musical genre in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico combining bachata melodies and reggaeton-style beats, lyrics, rapping and disc-jockeying. Queen described the song as combining feelings with bachata and urban beats, later claiming the song to be a [...] "sentimental subject where we fused bachata and urban rhythms".|$|E
60|$|Without cap, without doublet, without shoes, just in my {{trunks and}} shirt and hose, as <b>I</b> was, <b>I</b> <b>ran,</b> heading by {{instinct}} for home as heads the animal {{that has been}} overtaken by danger whilst abroad.

500|$|As one of {{the founders}} of the {{cyberpunk}} genre, William Gibson has repeatedly been asked for his opinion on the subject of the mainstreaming of cyberpunk, which has often brought up the topic of Idol's album. In a 1994 interview, Gibson said that he did not approve of the way the term [...] "cyberpunk" [...] was being increasingly commercialised by popular culture, and that Idol had [...] "turned it into something very silly." [...] Gibson also said in another interview that to understand cyberpunk as a movement was [...] "something of a joke, as wonderfully demonstrated, not too long ago, by Billy Idol's Cyberpunk album." [...] Despite his negative comments, Gibson was bemused, rather than angered, by Idol's creation. Stating that he'd tried to withhold judgment before hearing the album, he eventually did and said [...] "...I just don't get what he's on about. I don't see the connection. [...] I had lunch with Billy years ago in Hollywood... and I thought he was a very likeable guy. He had a sense of humour about what he was doing that is not apparent in the product he puts out. If <b>I</b> <b>run</b> into him again, we can have a good laugh about what he's doing now!" ...|$|E

2500|$|When Eric Liddell accidentally {{misses a}} church prayer meeting {{because of his}} running, his sister Jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God. Eric tells her that though he intends to {{eventually}} return to the China mission, he feels divinely inspired when running, and that not to run would be to dishonour God, saying, [...] "I believe that God made me for a purpose. But He also made me fast, and when <b>I</b> <b>run,</b> I feel His pleasure." ...|$|E
60|$|So he {{kept talking}} as <b>I</b> <b>ran,</b> neither expecting nor {{receiving}} any answer.|$|R

2500|$|Frank Mir was a color {{commentator}} for World Extreme Cagefighting until WEC 47, when he {{was replaced}} by Stephan Bonnar. In June 2012, Mir stated {{in an interview with}} The Chronicle-Journal that he wants to pursue commentary after he retires from fighting. [...] "I like analyzing fights, and I like doing color commentating," [...] he said. [...] "It’s an opportunity I would take advantage of when <b>I</b> <b>run</b> into it. Hopefully it’s something I can do full time". Mir has also done commentary for Absolute Championship Berkut.|$|E

When formally announcing his candidacy for a second term as Governor of Minnesota on May 31, 2006, Pawlenty said, [...] "As to my future, if <b>I</b> <b>run</b> for governor and win, I will serve out my term for four years as governor."

2500|$|Harrods {{was sold}} for £1.5 billion.

Somebody like me? <b>I</b> <b>run</b> a business and I need to take bloody fucking trustee's permission to take my profit". Fayed was appointed honorary chairman of Harrods, a position he was scheduled to hold for at least six months.|$|E

2500|$|In the Gold Cup at Ascot on 17 June Mr Dinos, with Fallon in the saddle, started 5/4 {{favourite}} {{ahead of}} Papineau, Westerner, Brian Boru and Royal Rebel. After tracking the leaders Fallon sent the favourite into the lead three furlongs out, but Mr Dinos faded in {{the straight and}} finished sixth of the thirteen runners behind Papineau. After the race Cole reported that the horse was [...] "very sore" [...] and [...] "jarred-up" [...] after racing on the [...] "lightning-fast" [...] ground and added [...] "I'll be more careful where <b>I</b> <b>run</b> him in future". In fact Mr Dinos did not race again in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|Considered {{to be more}} {{emotional}} than the lead single, [...] "Still Breathing" [...] is characterized as a [...] "serious" [...] track. Armstrong intended to make others happy, {{and to make a}} difference, by getting people to recognize themselves in the song. He described the track as [...] "a very heavy song", and further explained, [...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>run</b> away from being too heavy. But sometimes it just comes out that way." [...] While commenting on the chorus, I'm still breathing on my own, he added, [...] "at some point, we're all {{going to have to be}} on life support. As time goes on, your thoughts get darker." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gallucci was an {{imposing}} man, [...] "a big fellow with a pleasant {{face and a}} hearty laugh." [...] While he paraded through Harlem swinging a loaded cane, he was always immaculately dressed in tailored suits with a magnificently waxed mustache, an expensive $2,000 diamond ring and $3,000 diamond shirt studs. He denied the allegations. [...] "My enemies say that I am {{the head of the}} 'Black Hand' business, that <b>I</b> <b>run</b> the blackmail bomb business and that I own all the lotteries," [...] Gallucci complained a week before he was killed. [...] "They are wrong. I own bakeries, ice and wood shops, shoe shining and repair shops and similar places, but I am not king of the 'Black Hand'."
