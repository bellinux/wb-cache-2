25|$|The basic {{requirements}} build upon {{the first step}} in the pyramid: physiology. If there are deficits on this level, all behavior will be oriented to satisfy this deficit. Essentially, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> slept or eaten adequately, you won't be interested in your self-esteem desires. Subsequently, we have the second level, which awakens a need for security. After securing those two levels, the motives shift to the social sphere, the third level. Psychological requirements comprise the fourth level, while the top of the hierarchy consists of self-realization and self-actualization.|$|E
500|$|Sakimoto composes {{his music}} by playing the pieces [...] "briefly on the piano", and then {{working on a}} {{computer}} for more detailed arrangements. The style of Sakimoto's compositions is mostly orchestral; he creates the orchestral sound by playing the music through a sequencer instead of using a real orchestra due to the high cost. When composing a soundtrack for a video game, Sakimoto first sits down with the director or producer {{of the game and}} works out what emotions they want the game to evoke in the player, and after making a demo for them, sets out to create music that fits that feeling. He claims that his style of composition does not change when he works on non-game works such as anime series, saying that only the tone of the pieces is different. He attributes any changes in his style over the years to his desire to constantly keep growing and learning new styles and techniques, saying that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> moved forward in your skill and style over time, [...] "you've wasted your time".|$|E

2500|$|The {{hierarchy}} of the Paris Opera Ballet is very strict. For a dancer it is virtually compulsory to enter first the Paris Opera Ballet School. [...] "You cannot get into the company <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> done the school" [...] (Mathilde Froustey). The competition for admission to both institutions is extremely fierce {{as well as the}} competition for the highest ranks in the ballet company.|$|E
2500|$|The {{family first}} rented a house {{at what was}} called Nook Farm in 1871 before buying land there and {{building}} a new house. Twain said of Hartford, [...] "Of all the beautiful towns {{it has been my}} fortune to see, this is the chiefâ€¦. You do not know what beauty is <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been here." [...] He was attracted to the town which had the highest per-capita income of any city in the United States at that time.|$|E
2500|$|Updike often {{wrote about}} death, his {{characters}} providing a [...] "mosaic of reactions" [...] to mortality, ranging from terror to attempts at insulation. In The Poorhouse Fair (1959), the elderly John Hook intones, [...] "There is no goodness without belief... And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> believed, {{at the end}} of your life you shall know you have buried your talent in the ground of this world and have nothing saved, to take into the next", demonstrating a religious, metaphysical faith present in much of Updike's work.|$|E

2500|$|In 1975 the {{scientists}} said that Genie's voice had clearly strengthened and she modified both pitch and volume for emphasis and stress, but {{she continued to}} avoid speaking if possible because controlling her voice remained very difficult for her. Her vocalizations were still soft and breathy, and they wrote that, [...] "it is still very difficult to understand her <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been with her {{for a period of}} time." [...] In mid-1975 she could speak with a relatively normal declarative sentence stress pattern, and began to do so with increasing frequency. Even then her pronunciation also remained abnormal, as she still frequently deleted and substituted sounds in her speech, and she remained unable to use intonation to indicate a question.|$|E
2500|$|Fisher was {{appointed}} to command [...] as flag captain to the Admiral of the North America and West Indies Station, Astley Cooper Key, from 2 March 1877 to 4 June 1878. Bellerophon {{had been in the}} dockyard for repairs, so the new crew was less than perfect in carrying out their duties. Fisher told them I intend to give you hell for three months, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> come up to my standard in that time you'll have hell for another three months. Midshipman (later Admiral) A. H. Gordon Moore reported, Fisher was a very exacting master and I had at times long and arduous duties, long hours at the engine room telegraphs in cold fog, etc., and the least inattention was punished. It was, I think, his way of proving us, for he always rewarded us in some way when an extra hard bit of work was over.|$|E
2500|$|EA {{began selling}} Spore without SecuROM on December 22, 2008 through Steam. Furthermore, EA Games {{president}} Frank Gibeau announced that maximum install limit would be increased from 3 to 5 {{and that it}} would be possible to de-authorize and move installations to new machines, citing the need to adapt their policy to accommodate their legitimate customers. EA has stated, [...] "By running the de-authorization tool, a machine 'slot' will be freed up on the online Product Authorization server and can then be re-used by another machine. You can de-authorize at any time, even without uninstalling Spore, and free up that machine authorization. If you re-launch Spore on the same machine, the game will attempt to re-authorize. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> reached the machine limitation, the game will authorize and the machine will be re-authorized using up one of the five available machines." [...] However, the de-authorization tool to do this is not available on the Mac platform. In 2016, a DRM-free version of Spore was released on GOG.com.|$|E

2500|$|From 1891 to 1900, Everhard {{served as}} {{president}} of the Ohio Suffrage Association. In 1894, she led the successful effort to secure school suffrage for Ohio women. She also gained for Ohio women the right to vote in municipal elections. She was among the suffrage activists who spoke at a hearing of the House judiciary committee in Washington D. C. in 1896, led by Susan B. Anthony. Everhard's remarks gave her reasons for activism:You probably wonder, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> asked, why we are not at home looking after our families instead of coming to Washington to pester you. It is just because we want to take better care of our homes that we have come. I for one pay enough in taxes every year to buy a farm and yet I have no right to say how they shall be collected or how expended. It is a mistake to say that women do not want the ballot, for in Ohio, where we have been given school suffrage, interest has grown rapidly, and now women who at first did not even want school suffrage have been educated into being full-fledged suffragists." ...|$|E
