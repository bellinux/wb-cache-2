5|$|In 2010, the Environmental Working Group {{studied the}} {{drinking}} water in 35 American cities in the first nationwide study. The study found measurable hexavalent chromium in the tap water of 31 of the cities sampled, with Norman, Oklahoma, {{at the top of}} list; 25 cities had levels that exceeded California's proposed limit. Concentrations of Cr(VI) in US municipal drinking water supplies reported by EWG are within likely, natural background levels for the areas tested and not necessarily indicative of <b>industrial</b> <b>pollution,</b> as asserted by EWG. This factor was not taken into consideration in the EWG report.|$|E
5|$|Radyr Weir {{was built}} in 1774 to divert water into a leat to the Melingriffith Tin Plate Works. The weir is the third {{obstacle}} to migratory salmon and sea trout — the others being Llandaff Weir and Blackweir, both of which also have fish passes. Since the early 1980s, the salmon and sea trout stocks in the Taff have been recovering from nearly 200 years of <b>industrial</b> <b>pollution</b> and exploitation. In 1993 the National Rivers Authority monitored over 500 salmon and 700 sea trout returning to the river to spawn.|$|E

In this way, 10% of the total industrial site and 28% of the entire Zone will be transformed into green space.|$|R
5|$|Since {{the late}} 19th century, {{public and private}} sectors have heavily {{developed}} the river. To aid ship and barge navigation, locks have been built along the lower Columbia and its tributaries, and dredging has opened, maintained, and enlarged shipping channels. Since the early 20th century, dams have been built across the river for power generation, navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The 14 hydroelectric dams on the Columbia's main stem and many more on its tributaries produce more than 44percent of total U.S. hydroelectric generation. Production of nuclear power has taken place at two sites along the river. Plutonium for nuclear weapons was produced for decades at the Hanford Site, which is now the most contaminated nuclear site in the US. These developments have greatly altered river environments in the watershed, mainly through <b>industrial</b> <b>pollution</b> and barriers to fish migration.|$|E

30|$|To {{combat the}} global warming and climate change, we need to {{establish}} a “sustainable society” {{in which we can}} simultaneously attain both economic prosperity and environmental protection by coordinating social and economic systems. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed by UN serves as important guidelines for achieving the sustainable society. Pursuing SDGs is closely linked to corporate management, because environmental problems have been long influencing not only our social and economic systems but also corporate operations in real business world because all industrial sectors need to consider their business strategies that adapt various regulation changes on <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutions.</b> The benefits from installing GHG reduction technologies or green technologies in private sectors range from intangible ones, such as improved public image as “green corporate citizen,” to measurable ones such as reduced GHG emission levels. These benefits, for example, are derived from the promotion of green products and introduction of green supply chain systems in a firm.

It questions our ontological relationship to the world, and the possibility of a fair policy addressing the needs of mankind, present and future, local and global, and of new forms of governance. The notion of [...] "Environmental Justice" [...] was created in the 1970s-1980s in North American cities to denounce the spatial overlapping between forms of racial discrimination and social-economic exclusion, <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutions</b> and vulnerability to natural hazards.|$|R

30|$|At {{the end of}} this section, we need to {{note that}} the degree of UEN_v^I and that of UEM_v^I on 21 Asian {{countries}} from 2008 to 2014 have similar results as documented in Tables  2 and 3. Therefore, similar policy implication discussed from Tables  2 and 3 may be obtained from the ones in the cases. For example, the huge population may be the rationale concerning decreased UEM_v^I in China and India. This indicates that they need challenging policy to reduce <b>industrial</b> <b>pollutions</b> in developing their economies. Hence, this study does not document their results to reduce the length of this manuscript.|$|R

This research also look at the factors that support and hinder the performance of Environmental Agencies. This research takes location in Surakarta and done in Surakarta Environmental Agencies. Research type is qualitative descriptive, where this research tries to describe about a certain situation or social phenomenon and does assessment about research problems. Data collecting is done with documentation and interview techniques. Data using primary and secondary data, primary data obtained directly from the informant who relating to cope with batik <b>industrial</b> waste water <b>pollution</b> inVillage Laweyan both from Environmental Agencies or from the public. While secondary data derived from the books, document and other information resources related with research. From result of research can be concluded that the overall implementation of activities in tackling batik <b>industrial</b> waste water <b>pollution</b> have been implemented. But the result has not shown the maximum result, which still happened batik <b>industrial</b> waste water <b>pollution</b> and still many batik industries which have not owned IPAL. This thing is because of some factors coming from the Environmental Agencies and the industry community. Environmental Agencies however, as the implementing authority has tried to tackle pollution. Based on research result, BLH need to increase produktivity, especially in prevention, surveillance and control activity. Need other alternatives beside IPAL communal because the IPAL communal does not fix batik <b>industrial</b> waste water <b>pollution</b> in LaweyanVillage.
