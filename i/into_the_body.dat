5|$|Plutonium-239 and 240 emit {{ionizing}} radiation {{in the form}} of alpha particles. Inhalation is the primary pathway by which plutonium enters the body, though plutonium can also enter the body through a wound. Once inhaled, plutonium increases the risk of lung cancer, liver cancer, bone cancer, and leukemia. Once absorbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> the biological half life of plutonium is about 200 years.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} caterpillar, such as many hawkmoths (Sphingidae), have eyespots on their {{anterior}} abdominal segments. When alarmed, they retract {{the head and}} the thoracic segments <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> leaving the apparently threatening large eyes {{at the front of}} the visible part of the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{element is}} most {{dangerous}} if taken <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> In addition, californium-249 and californium-251 can cause tissue damage externally, through gamma ray emission. Ionizing radiation emitted by californium on bone {{and in the}} liver can cause cancer.|$|E

5|$|The main {{position}} on Spirit baptism among the Reformed churches, dispensationalists, and many Baptists {{is that the}} baptism with the Holy Spirit occurs simultaneously with regeneration, when those who have faith in Jesus Christ receive the Holy Spirit and are incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Thorium is {{odourless}} and tasteless. The chemical {{toxicity of}} thorium is low because thorium and its most common compounds (mostly the dioxide) are poorly soluble in water, precipitating out {{before entering the}} body as the hydroxide. Some thorium compounds are chemically moderately toxic, especially {{in the presence of}} strong complex-forming ions such as citrate that carry the thorium <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> in soluble form. If thorium is ingested, 0.4% of it and 90% of its dangerous daughters are leached <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Out of the thorium that does remain in the body, three quarters of it accumulates in the skeleton. Absorption through the skin is possible, but is not a likely means of exposure. Thorium's low solubility in water also means that excretion of thorium by the kidneys and faeces is rather slow.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{toxicity}} of iridium compounds because they are used in very small amounts, but soluble salts, such as the iridium halides, could be hazardous due to elements other than iridium or due to iridium itself. However, most iridium compounds are insoluble, which makes absorption <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> difficult.|$|E

5|$|Deities {{were present}} {{not only in}} the heavens, but also in the human body itself. They were {{responsible}} for maintaining the body's five viscera, guarding the registers of life, and regulating the souls. There were five internal deities that were particularly important in Lingbao Daoism. The Great Unity lived in the head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the liver and lungs. The Director of Destinies lived in the heart and sexual organs, and finally, the Peach Child lived in the lower dantian. Normally these deities resided in the heavens, but they could be activated by scriptural recitations to descend <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{which can}} be {{transmitted}} from one organism to another are known as infectious diseases, and the causative biological agent involved {{is known as a}} pathogen. The process by which the pathogen is introduced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is known as inoculation, and the organism it affects is known as a biological host. When the pathogen establishes itself in a step known as colonization, it can result in an infection, consequently harming the host directly or through the harmful substances called toxins it can produce. This results in the various symptoms and signs characteristic of an infectious disease like pneumonia or diphtheria.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest X {{is set in}} {{the world}} of Astoltia, with the player {{character}} being initially human before an attack by the Lord of Hell Nelgel forces their soul <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of another race. Following this, they must gather magical gems to seal Nelgel once again, while the player character's sibling is sent back in time to be safe from Nelgel. Gameplay follows a combination of elements from the Dragon Quest and other contemporary MMORPGs, such as real-time combat in an open world environment and a job system tied to skills and abilities.|$|E

Reagent can be mixed into a slurry in a vertical mixing tank, or similar, and dosed directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water <b>body</b> (e.g. a tailings storage facility (TSF) or pond) via a pipeline. Some systems mix the reagent in a tank and spray it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water <b>body</b> using a spray cannon.

5|$|Even though alpha {{radiation}} cannot penetrate the skin, ingested or inhaled plutonium does irradiate internal organs. Alpha particles generated by inhaled plutonium {{have been found}} to cause lung cancer in a cohort of European nuclear workers. The skeleton, where plutonium accumulates, and the liver, where it collects and becomes concentrated, are at risk. Plutonium is not absorbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> efficiently when ingested; only 0.04% of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion. Plutonium absorbed by the body is excreted very slowly, with a biological half-life of 200 years. Plutonium passes only slowly through cell membranes and intestinal boundaries, so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into bone structure proceeds very slowly.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} molluscs, the {{excretory}} organs of bivalves are {{a pair of}} nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> cavity just beneath the heart, and a bladder to store urine. The pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or attach to the pericardium, and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a pair of openings {{near the front of}} {{the upper part of the}} mantle cavity, from where it joins the stream of exhalant water.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds have streamlined, {{spindle-shaped}} {{bodies with}} reduced or non-existent external ear flaps, rounded heads, flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, and small tails. Pinniped skulls have large eye orbits, short snouts and a constricted interorbital region. They are unique among carnivorans in that their orbital walls are significantly {{shaped by the}} maxilla and are not limited by certain facial bones. Compared to other carnivorans, their teeth tend to be fewer in number (especially incisors and back molars), are pointed and cone-shaped, and lack carnassials. The walrus has unique upper canines that are elongated into tusks. The mammary glands and genitals of pinnipeds can retract <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E

5|$|Set in {{the city}} of Hirasaki in modern-day Japan, the story follows a college student whose death at the hands of demons forces his soul <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of Summoner Kyouji Kuzunoha. Now in Kuzunoha's body, the protagonist must {{investigate}} the appearance of demons in the town and the activities of Sid Davis, the Dark Summoner responsible for killing the protagonist and Kuzunoha. The gameplay carries over multiple classic elements from the Megami Tensei series, including first-person dungeon navigation, turn-based battles, and negotiation with demons to recruit them into the player's party.|$|E
5|$|Star Dust {{is likely}} to have flown into a nearly {{vertical}} snow field {{near the top of the}} glacier, causing an avalanche that buried the wreckage within seconds and concealed it from searchers. As the compressed snow turned to ice, the wreckage would have been incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of the glacier, with fragments emerging many years later and much farther down the mountain. Between 1998 and 2000, about ten per cent of the total expected wreckage emerged from the glacier, prompting several re-examinations of the accident. More debris is expected to emerge in future, not only as a result of normal glacial motion, but also as the glacier melts.|$|E
5|$|The Alexandrian texts were {{incorporated}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of classical Greek literature that was preserved, catalogued and studied by scholars of the Hellenistic period. From then until the fourth centuryAD, {{copies of his}} orations multiplied {{and they were in}} a relatively good position to survive the tense period from the sixth until the ninth centuryAD. In the end, sixty-one orations attributed to Demosthenes survived till the present day (some however are pseudonymous). Friedrich Blass, a German classical scholar, believes that nine more speeches were recorded by the orator, but they are not extant. Modern editions of these speeches are based on four manuscripts of the tenth and eleventh centuriesAD.|$|E

Legend also holds that after the last Cornish chough departs from Cornwall, then the return of the chough, as happened in 2001, will mark the return of King Arthur.|$|E
5|$|A spine is a sharp, {{needle-like}} structure used {{to inflict}} pain on predators. An {{example of this}} seen in nature is in the Sohal surgeonfish. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine {{on the front of}} each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish. Defensive spines may be detachable, barbed or poisonous. Porcupine spines are long, stiff, break at the tip, and are barbed to stick into a would-be predator. In contrast, the hedgehog's short spines, which are modified hairs, readily bend, and are barbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> so they are not easily lost; they may be jabbed at an attacker.|$|E
5|$|A {{worldwide}} backlash {{over the}} resulting destruction, and the fears Wanda's hallucinations incited, send the team into hiding {{at a safe}} house. Thor departs to consult with Dr. Erik Selvig {{on the meaning of}} the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, while Romanoff and Banner plan to flee together after realizing a mutual attraction. However, Nick Fury arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In Seoul, Ultron forces the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to use her synthetic-tissue technology, together with vibranium and the scepter's gem, to perfect a new body for him. As Ultron uploads himself <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn against Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff.|$|E
