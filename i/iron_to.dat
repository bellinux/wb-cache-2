5|$|Puddling process: The {{puddling}} process was known the ancient Chinese during the Han Dynasty by the 1st century AD.

5|$|The {{bridge was}} rebuilt between 1895 and 1896 {{to convert it}} from <b>iron</b> <b>to</b> steel. It was {{repeatedly}} reinforced throughout its existence. When Conrail closed the Wallkill Valley line in 1977, {{the stability of the}} trestle had been one of its primary reasons for doing so. Conrail had tried to sell the bridge as early as 1983, and in 1986 the trestle was sold to a private businessman, John Rahl, for one dollar.|$|E

In 1990 it was extended 40 kilometres from <b>Iron</b> Baron <b>to</b> <b>Iron</b> Duke. After iron ore production ceased at Iron Baron in 1991 and Iron Duke in 1998, the line from Middleton Junction closed.

5|$|Around 1876, {{railways}} {{around the}} world began to use steel, instead of malleable iron, for rails. As a result, production at Consett fell by a third. The company switched production to iron plates, demand for which was rising rapidly for shipbuilding. In 1882, Consett Iron Company began to switch production again, this time to steel plates for shipbuilding using the Siemens-Martin process. This uses open hearth furnaces to convert pig <b>iron</b> <b>to</b> steel by burning off excess carbon. The first Siemens furnaces at Consett came into production in 1883. In 1887 the company began to produce steel {{in a variety of}} cross-sections, such as angle (L-section) steel, rolled joists and girders for shipbuilding. For this purpose it created the Angle Mills on a sixteen-acre site, able to produce 1500 tons of angles, bars and girders per week.|$|E
5|$|Boron was not {{recognized}} as an element until it was isolated by Sir Humphry Davy and by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard. In 1808 Davy observed that electric current sent through a solution of borates produced a brown precipitate {{on one of the}} electrodes. In his subsequent experiments, he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of electrolysis. He produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named the element boracium. Gay-Lussac and Thénard used <b>iron</b> <b>to</b> reduce boric acid at high temperatures. By oxidizing boron with air, they showed that boric acid is an oxidation product of boron. Jöns Jakob Berzelius identified boron as an element in 1824. Pure boron was arguably first produced by the American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub in 1909.|$|E
5|$|Co-fusion steel process: Although British {{scientist}} and historian Joseph Needham speculates {{that it could}} have existed beforehand, the first clear written evidence of the fusion of wrought iron and cast <b>iron</b> <b>to</b> make steel comes from the 6th century AD in regards to the Daoist swordsmith Qiwu Huaiwen, who was put in charge of the arsenal of Northern Wei general Gao Huan from 543 to 550 AD. The Tang Dynasty (618–907) Newly Reorganized Pharmacopoeia of 659 also described this process of mixing and heating wrought iron and cast iron together, stating that the steel product was used to make sickles and Chinese sabers. In regards to the latter text, Su Song (1020–1101) made a similar description and noted the steel's use for making swords.|$|E

5|$|Galenas keel {{was laid}} down by Maxson, Fish & Co. in 1861 and she was {{launched}} on 14 February 1862. The ship was commissioned on 21 April 1862 with Commander Alfred Taylor in command. Galena arrived in Hampton Roads on 24 April, after having suffered several engine breakdowns en route, and was assigned to Flag Officer L.M. Goldsborough's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Commander John Rodgers relieved Taylor the same day. When Goldsborough inspected the ship shortly after her arrival he ordered that her spars be cut away and the nuts {{on the inside of}} her hull to be covered with sheet <b>iron</b> <b>to</b> prevent them from breaking loose when the ship was hit.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in the risk that a person will develop PTE; people with the ApoE-ε4 allele may be at higher risk for PTE. The {{haptoglobin}} Hp2-2 allele may be another genetic risk factor, possibly because it binds hemoglobin poorly and thus allows more <b>iron</b> <b>to</b> escape and damage tissues. However, most studies have found that having family members with epilepsy does not significantly increase the risk of PTS, suggesting that genetics are not a strong risk factor.|$|E
5|$|Iron mining {{occurred}} in several locations, including the main English centre in the Forest of Dean, {{as well as}} in Durham and the Weald. Some <b>iron</b> <b>to</b> meet English demand was also imported from the continent, especially by the late 13th century. By the end of the 12th century, the older method of acquiring iron ore through strip mining was being supplemented by more advanced techniques, including tunnels, trenches and bell-pits. Iron ore was usually locally processed at a bloomery, and by the 14th century the first water-powered iron forge in England was built at Chingley. As a result of the diminishing woodlands and consequent increases in the cost of both wood and charcoal, demand for coal increased in the 12th century and it began to be commercially produced from bell-pits and strip mining.|$|E

5|$|New {{methods of}} {{producing}} it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century. In the Industrial Revolution, {{new methods of}} producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s, Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig <b>iron,</b> <b>to</b> produce mild steel. This made steel much more economical, thereby leading to wrought iron no longer being produced in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|Replacement of the ship's -tall, -wide lower masts in {{wood was}} not feasible, {{so they were}} made of steel tube cut and welded to shape, with a ladder inside each mast to allow access to the {{platforms}} on the masts. The three masts and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985. Warriors engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast <b>iron</b> <b>to</b> duplicate the look of the real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine how they might have looked in operation.|$|E
5|$|The Han-era Chinese used {{bronze and}} <b>iron</b> <b>to</b> make {{a range of}} weapons, culinary tools, carpenters' tools and {{domestic}} wares. A significant product of these improved iron-smelting techniques was the manufacture of new agricultural tools. The three-legged iron seed drill, invented by the 2nd century BC, enabled farmers to carefully plant crops in rows instead of casting seeds out by hand. The heavy moldboard iron plow, also invented during the Han dynasty, required only one man to control it, two oxen to pull it. It had three plowshares, a seed box for the drills, a tool which turned down the soil and could sow roughly 45,730 m2 (11.3 acres) of land in a single day.|$|E
