5|$|A federal {{government}} is only sensible, for Russell, when it has limited but well-defined powers. Russell advocates {{the creation of a}} world government made up of sovereign nation-states (Russell 1938:197, 230–31). On <b>his</b> <b>view,</b> the function of a world government should only be to ensure the avoidance of war and the pursuit of peace (Russell 1938:230-31). On the world stage, democracy would be impossible, because of the negligible power any particular individual could have in comparison with the entire human race.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} the penalty was taken, the Welsh dugout was {{surrounded}} by press and photographers, as the home team were still leading 1–0.

5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the gekiken kogyo performances, in his later years Sakakibara regretted their development. In <b>his</b> <b>view,</b> the rules and strictures of gekiken were perverting kenjutsu into new forms that were no longer {{relevant}} to battlefield combat. He disdained the point-scoring swordsmanship of other kendoka of his era, ignoring light touches by his opponents in order to deliver his own powerful strikes. Nonetheless, the gekiken kogyo practices which he began created an interest in fencing which led ultimately to the development of modern kendo.|$|E

5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, {{pointing}} out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration.

Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E

As a further liberation of women, Periyar pushed for the right of women to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.|$|E
