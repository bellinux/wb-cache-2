Matteo Ricci, the first Jesuit to reach Beijing (1598), noted that [...] "Saracens are everywhere in evidence [...] [...] [...] their thousands of families are scattered about in nearly every province" [...] Ricci noted that the term Huihui or Hui was applied by Chinese not only to [...] "Saracens" [...] (Muslims) but also to Chinese Jews and supposedly even to Christians.

The 1916 Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics, Volume 8 said that Chinese Muslims always called themselves Huihui or Huizi, and that neither themselves nor other people called themselves Han, and they disliked people calling them Dungan. A French army Commandant Viscount D'Ollone wrote a report on what he saw among Hui in 1910. He reported that due to religion, Hui were classed as a different nationality from Han as if they were one of the other minority groups.|$|E

5000|$|As part of {{the work}} that OpenEJB did to prepare for the {{integration}} with Apple's WebObjects, a very large integration test suite was developed. The test suite was developed as a <b>generic</b> <b>application</b> since it would need to be run against both WebObjects and other platforms that integrated OpenEJB. For simplicity in the build the test suite, based on JUnit, was run with OpenEJB right inside the tests rather than as a separate process, which was easy to do as the container was designed to be plugged into other platforms and make as little assumptions about its environment as possible. It was from this work that the concept of combining an EJB application with plain unit tests and an embeddable EJB container was born. Originally referred to as a [...] "local" [...] EJB container and what lead the project to describe itself as being able to run in two modes: Local and Remote.|$|E

40|$|Visual Modeller ” is a CASE {{tool that}} permits {{end-users}} to model business processes, using the associated method “Visual Modelling”. It is {{also able to}} generate the database and a “front-end” application from this model. Although this generation looks like an integrated process to the user, an intermediary step exists. From {{the model of the}} business process, “Visual Modeller ” first builds a model of the application that will be generated (ie a model of the future system), and then from this model, generates the database and the application. This document describes the code generation process in “Visual Modeller”. How, from the business process model, it builds a model of the application, called the <b>generic</b> <b>application.</b> The <b>generic</b> <b>application</b> is greatly independent of the implementation environment; in fact, it is not built for any particular environment, but rather in a generic environment, which characteristics are predefined, independently of the characteristics of the implementation environment. This document describes why this approach adjusts to the particularities of the user-centred method carried by “Visual Modeller”, why it brings some benefits in dealing with the best design and development principles, why it optimises the capability of “Visual Modeller ” to generate some code for different environments.

40|$|Abstract:- Currently, {{the mobile}} {{application}} {{can be classified}} into two types (mobile application and mobile Web application). The former can be directly executed in the devices. The later is mobile Web application which is executed through an embedded mobile Web browser. At this time, there are no toolkits capable of developing both types of applications through authoring a single <b>generic</b> <b>application</b> interface. So we propose a visualized toolkit within an integrated development environment and discuss the design issues. The toolkit can create the <b>generic</b> <b>application</b> interface simply through intuitive drag-and-drop generate to two types of applications through transformation style sheet. Developers can utilize this integrated toolkit to compile or test both types of applications to save development time and reduce development effort...|$|E
