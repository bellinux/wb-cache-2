Proteins in the <b>differentiating</b> <b>tissue</b> of tension wood were {{compared}} to those of normal wood on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

At least five bands (19, 22, 37, 41, and 55 kDa) were specific in the <b>differentiating</b> <b>tissue</b> of tension wood. These proteins were bound to the cell wall, plasma membrane, or both by their electric charge; they were undetectable until 14 days after inclination. Mature tension wood was observed in the tissue at 14 days. Thus, all <b>differentiating</b> <b>tissue</b> at 14 days was produced after inclination. On the other hand, the differentiating zone at 7 days contained the same tissue, as in tension wood estimated by the vessel number and diameter during the early phase; and the tissue was indistinguishable from normal wood during the late phase. The proteins found here were related to the phenomenon occurring in the late stage of xylem differentiation.|$|R

The expression of CD 44 in oral cancer tissue was analysed by using immunohistochemical technique.

40|$|Tau-mediated neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's {{disease and}} tauopathies is {{generally}} assumed {{to start in}} a normally developed brain. However, several lines of evidence suggest that impaired Tau isoform expression during development could affect mitosis and ploidy in post-mitotic <b>differentiated</b> <b>tissue.</b> Interestingly, the relative expression levels of Tau isoforms containing either 3 (3 R-Tau) or 4 repeats (4 R-Tau) {{play an important role}} both during brain development and neurodegeneration. Here, we used genetic and cellular tools to study the link between 3 R and 4 R-Tau isoform expression, mitotic progression in neuronal progenitors and post-mitotic neuronal survival. Our results illustrated that the severity of Tau-induced adult phenotypes depends on 4 R-Tau isoform expression during development. As recently described, we observed a mitotic delay in 4 R-Tau expressing cells of larval eye discs and brains. Live imaging revealed that the spindle undergoes a cycle of collapse and recovery before proceeding to anaphase. Furthermore, we found a high level of aneuploidy in post-mitotic <b>differentiated</b> <b>tissue.</b> Finally, we showed that overexpression of wild type and mutant 4 R-Tau isoform in neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y cell lines is sufficient to induce monopolar spindles. Taken together, our results suggested that neurodegeneration could be in part linked to neuronal aneuploidy caused by 4 R-Tau expression during brain development. status: publishe...|$|E

Elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanism {{may contribute to the}} advance-ment of cell-based regenerative medicine. In the present work, we performed a large scale analysis of the phos-phoproteome in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. Using multiplex strategies, we detected 4581 proteins and 3970 high confidence distinct phosphosites in 1642 phosphoproteins. Notably, 22 prominent phosphoryla-ted stem cell marker proteins with 39 novel phospho-sites were identified for the first time by mass spectrom-etry, including phosphorylation sites in NANOG (Ser- 65) and RE 1 silencing transcription factor (Ser- 950 and Thr- 953). Quantitative profiles of NANOG peptides obtained during the differentiation of mES cells revealed that the abundance of phosphopeptides and non-phosphopep-tides decreased with different trends. To our knowl-edge, this study presents the largest global character-ization of phosphorylation in mES cells. Compared with a study of ultimately <b>differentiated</b> <b>tissue</b> cells, a bioin-formatics analysis of the phosphorylation data set re-vealed a consistent phosphorylation motif in human and mouse ES cells. Moreover, investigations into phosphor-ylation conservation suggested that phosphoproteins were more conserved in the undifferentiated ES cell state than in the ultimately <b>differentiated</b> <b>tissue</b> cell state. How-ever, the opposite conclusion was drawn from this con-servation comparison with phosphosites. Overall, this work provides an overview of phosphorylation in mES cells and is a valuable resource for the future under-standing of basic biology in mES cells. Molecular &...|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose: Vitro {{cartilage}} {{differentiation of}} mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been noticed in several investigations. In this regard, almost always molecular differentiation {{of the cells}} has been examined, while structural and morphological differentiation of them has been ignored. Therefore, the present study examines the structure and ultrastructure of the cartilage differentiated from murine MSCs {{compared with that of}} costal cartilage. Materials and Methods: 2 × 105 MSCs isolated from the bone marrow of NMRI mice were pleted by centrifugation and cultured for 21 days in chondrogenic medium. At the end of cultivation period, occurrence of chondrogenic differentiation was confirmed by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis for some cartilage-specific genes. To compare the structure of <b>differentiated</b> <b>tissue</b> with that of natural cartilage, the cartilage was differentiated from MSCs and the cartilage obtained from the same murine rib was prepared for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: Structural studies indicated that similar to the costal cartilage, the cartilage produced from differentiation of perichondrium-like layer was formed. According to the microscopic images, in contrast to costal chondrocytes, the differentiated cells had euchromatic nucleus and their cytoplasm contained plenty of the organelles involved in active cell secretion. Furthermore, intercellular matrix in differentiated cartilage had a fibrillar appearance. Conclusion: Our results indicated that the structure of cartilage produced in micro mass culture system is somewhat different from that of costal cartilage. The cells from <b>differentiated</b> <b>tissue</b> seemed to be more active than those from costal cartilage. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{multipotency}} and proliferative {{capacity of}} {{human embryonic stem}} cells (hESCs) make them a promising source of stem cells for transplant therapies and of vital importance given the shortage in organ donation. Recent studies suggest some immune privilege associated with hESC-derived tissues. However, the adaptability {{of the immune system}} makes it unlikely that fully <b>differentiated</b> <b>tissues</b> will permanently evade immune rejection. One promising solution is to induce a state of immune tolerance to a hESC line using tolerogenic hematopoietic cells derived from it. This could provide acceptance of other <b>differentiated</b> <b>tissues</b> from the same line. However, this approach will require efficient multilineage hematopoiesis from hESCs. This review proposes that more efficient differentiation of hESCs to the tolerogenic cell types required is most likely to occur through applying knowledge gained of the ontogeny of complex regulatory signals used by the embryo for definitive hematopoietic development in vivo. Stepwise formation of mesoderm, induction of definitive hematopoietic stem cells, and the application of factors key to their self-renewal may improve in vitro production both quantitatively and qualitatively...|$|R

SIRT 1 expression is regulated transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally, and its enzymatic activity is controlled by NAD+ levels and interacting proteins. We found that SIRT 1 protein levels were much higher in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) than in <b>differentiated</b> <b>tissues.</b> miRNAs post-transcriptionally downregulated SIRT 1 during mESC differentiation and maintained low levels of SIRT 1 expression in <b>differentiated</b> <b>tissues.</b> Specifically, miR- 181 a and b, miR- 9, miR- 204, miR- 199 b, and miR- 135 a suppressed SIRT 1 protein expression. Inhibition of mir- 9, the SIRT 1 -targeting miRNA induced earliest during mESC differentiation, prevented SIRT 1 downregulation. Conversely, SIRT 1 protein levels were upregulated post-transcriptionally during the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. The regulation of SIRT 1 protein levels by miRNAs might provide new opportunities for therapeutic tissue-specific modulation of SIRT 1 expression and for reprogramming of somatic cells into iPS cells...|$|R
