Lack of access to credit is generally seen as {{one of the main reasons}} why many people in developing economies remain poor. Usually, the poor have no access to loans from the banking system, because they cannot put up acceptable collateral and/or because the costs for banks of screening and monitoring the activities of the poor, and of enforcing their contracts, are too high to make lending to this group profitable. Since the late 1970 s, however, the poor in developing economies have increasingly gained access to small loans with the help of so-called microfinance programmes.

40|$|Over the years, {{the lending}} {{procedures}} of microcredit has evolved. The original <b>joint</b> <b>liability</b> group <b>lending</b> with simultaneous financing (loans released at once) {{has been replaced}} by sequential financing (loans released one by one). Moreover, recent studies suggest individual <b>liability</b> <b>lending</b> in groups to be the optimal choice.

In this study, we model these three schemes using the framework by Van Tassel (1999) and compare them. Further, we add exogenous peer monitoring costs and within-group heterogeneity of loan sizes to our models. Our findings prove that, in the presence of information asymmetry, group <b>lending</b> with <b>joint</b> <b>liability</b> dominates individual <b>liability</b> <b>lending</b> in groups. Furthermore, the interest rate of the sequential model is more sensitive to changes of monitoring costs or opportunity costs of capital than in the sequential model. On the contrary, sequential approach allows for higher degree of within-group heterogeneity of loan sizes. It is ambiguous which model achieves higher profit and lower interest rate. Our results confirm that the choice of optimal financing approach is determined by the characteristics of borrowers. JEL Classificiation G 2 Keywords [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Moral hazard {{is widely}} {{reported}} {{as a problem}} in credit and insurance markets, mainly arising from information asymmetry. Although theorists have attempted to explain how group lending with joint liability {{can be an important}} tool for mitigating moral hazard among the poor, empirical studies are rare and sometimes give mixed results. In Malawi, for example, although, group lending with joint liability has been practiced for nearly four decades, the unwillingness to repay loans remains the single major cause of default. This paper examines the extent of occurrence of moral hazard and investigates its determinants of occurrence among <b>joint</b> <b>liability</b> <b>lending</b> programs from Malawi, using group level data from 99 farm and non-farm credit groups. Results reveal that peer selection, peer monitoring, peer pressure, dynamic incentives and variables capturing the extent of matching problems explain most of the variation in the incidence of moral hazard among credit groups.

40|$|Spurred by its {{successful}} {{delivery of}} credit to poor borrowers in diverse areas of the developing world, <b>joint</b> <b>liability</b> <b>lending</b> has caught the imagination of development theorists and practitioners. Various theories have arisen to explain why joint liability group-based lending can be an improvement over traditional individual-based lending. Here we exploit {{the idea that if}} a model were true, the repayment rate would vary in a systematic way with various covariates. We thus use observed repayment rates to test across four representative and oft-cited models of <b>joint</b> <b>liability</b> <b>lending.</b> The theoretical part of this paper develops the models' implications for repayment and derives new ones, signing the derivative of a project choice, monitoring, default, or selection equation. For example, we find that several models imply that higher correlation of output can raise the observed repayment rate, and in some the ability to act cooperatively leads to lower repayment rates. More generally, the models agree on some dimensions and conflict on others. The empirical part uses survey data from 262 Thai joint liability groups of the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) and from 2880 households of the same villages. Nonparametric, univariate tests and multivariate logits are used to evaluate the predictions of the models. A hybrid, partially linear procedure is used to understand any differences in the results between the two types of tests. We find that the Besley and Coate model of limited enforcement is strongly supported in the more rural, poorer region of Thailand covered by the data. In the more prosperous region, closer to Bangkok, support is found for the Stiglitz model of moral hazard and the Ghatak model of adverse selection.

40|$|This paper investigates {{how social}} {{networks}} of group borrowers {{come into play}} in <b>joint</b> <b>liability</b> group <b>lending.</b> We use a large and original dataset containing 802 mapped social networks of borrowers from Pro Mujer Mexico. This is the first paper to look at external ties, i. e. social ties with individuals outside the borrowing group. Our main finding is that group <b>lending</b> with <b>joint</b> <b>liability</b> works when group borrowers use the informal risk insurance arrangement embedded in their external ties as guarantee for loan repayment. The extent to which this informal arrangement is used as guarantee is not decided by the borrower, but it {{is determined by the}} configuration of the group borrowers’ social networks, i. e. by their overlapping networks. These overlapping networks (or information channels) facilitate the diffusion of information into each other’s networks, and, thus, increases the credibility of the threat of losing one’s informal risk insurance arrangement in case of default. Our results show that the threat of losing the informal risk insurance arrangement embedded in one’s external ties matters for loan repayment even more than internal ties (i. e. ties between group members) ...|$|R
40|$|Peer-group {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} widely used by micro-credit institutions to minimize default risk. However, there are costs associated with establishing and maintaining liability groups. In the case when output is fully observable, we propose a dynamic individual lending mechanism. Assuming that risky borrowers discount the future costs and benefits relatively higher, our mechanism performs equally well in repayment rates, distinguishes safe and risky borrowers through differentiated interest rates and payment schedules. In case of unobservable types, it is able to eliminate adverse selection problem, and it reaches the first best outcome of the case that types of borrowers are publicly known. It improves wealth of individuals, and hence achieves a net welfare-superior outcome when compared with <b>joint</b> <b>liability.</b> Individual <b>lending</b> further saves from internal costs of group formation, and broadens the fractions of society into which microfinance institutions penetrate. We also identify unique welfare maximizing contract in our mechanism.

40|$|We {{design an}} artefactual field {{experiment}} {{to study the}} relationship between joint- <b>liability</b> <b>lending</b> and adverse selection, moral hazard and risk preferences.

The results of our experiment, carried on in partnership with a Bolivian microlender, show that borrowers exogenously endowed with a risky project are disproportionately likely to choose jointly-liability contracts over individually-liable contracts. This behavior {{does not appear to}} be motivated by risk-diversification, but rather by free-riding, as these subjects disproportionally switch from safe to risky projects when exogenously given a joint-liability contract instead of an individual contract.

40|$|Asymmetric {{information}} impairs {{the functioning}} of credit markets, in particular in developing countries where incomplete property rights and lack of collateral are a common joint occurrence. In such an environment financial institutions enable lending by transferring the responsibilities for the screening and monitoring of the borrowers {{as well as the}} enforcement of credit contracts, to the borrowers themselves to ease problems of asymmetric information. This comprises non-collateral based lending methodologies such as peer monitoring through co-signers (Klonner and Rai, 2010) and, especially, peer screening and monitoring in individual and <b>joint</b> <b>liability</b> group <b>lending</b> with the possibility to impose social sanctions (Gin and Karlan, 2014). In addition, improved personal identification through fingerprints may alleviate credit market imperfections (Gin et al., 2012). These approaches have in common that they rely on the punishment of non-compliance with credit contracts as principle enforcement mechanism, e. g. through legal action or social sanctions. They contrast with alternative mechanisms which reward compliance, rather than punishing non-compliance, with credit contracts. One example is dynamic incentives, i. e. offering bigger loans sizes to clients when the build up a positive credit history. Another example, and subject to this impact evaluation, is conditioning gratuitous insurance provision for the client through the financial institution on clients' good standing with the financial institution (clients are in good standing if they are neither in arrears nor completely defaulted on their loans). We evaluate the impact of such a conditional insurance provision on the repayment performances of microfinance clients in a Randomized Controlled Trial. The impact evaluation employs weekly data on the financial activities of roughly 22000 clients in 700 client centers from the management information system (MIS) of the microfinance institution. To evaluate the impact of the IEF on clients, we complement the weekly MIS data with weekly data on a subsample of 500 to 700 clients collected through phone surveys...|$|R

The researcher undertook an exploratory qualitative research through in-depth interviews on a purposively selected sample of eight beneficiaries from Malawi Rural Development Fund (MARDEF) in Bvumbwe area of Thyolo district in Malawi. The study revealed that, rural microfinance beneficiaries in Malawi lack a proper understanding of the peer mechanism in JLL and this distorts their perception and behaviour as regards loan repayments. This stems from lack of proper education and training to the beneficiaries prior to loan disbursements.

40|$|We examine group-lending under {{sequential}} financing.

Further, if the later loans are not too delayed, then under these conditions the expected payoff of the bank is greater compared to that under <b>joint</b> <b>liability</b> <b>lending.</b> Positive assortative matching or sequential financing (specially {{in the absence of}} joint liability) are no panacea though.

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} in the theoretical economic literature that joint liability group-based lending helps to overcome the hurdles of adverse selection, moral hazard, auditing cost and enforcement by exploiting local information embodied in specific social networks. Much less attention has been given to explain how other features of microcredit contracts have opened up possibilities for microfinance. In this paper I study a <b>joint</b> <b>liability</b> <b>lending</b> program in Thailand to analyze how social ties and policies such as compulsory savings and training contribute to explain the success of the program in terms of repayment rates in rural and urban communities. I use a novel panel dataset on household loans constructed from household, institutional and community-level data from the Townsend Thai Data Collection. Empirical results are consistent with the repayment predictions of existing theories on <b>joint</b> <b>liability</b> <b>lending.</b> The findings suggest that joint liability may prosper in areas in which social ties are strong enough to permit individuals to costlessly enforce agreements in their community, and the threat of social sanctions exists and is credible. Additionally, I find evidence that suggests that households in rural areas have some knowledge about the customs and characteristics of people and institutions in the region which varies across communities and predicts success and failure of the microfinance program. The estimation results also indicate that the degree of joint liability in the fund is negatively associated with repayment; and that practices such as requiring compulsory savings and providing training or information to borrowers are positive predictors of repayment in both rural and urban environments. The findings are robust to a number of specification checks...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three chapters that fall under the broad banner of contract theory, applied to topics in behavioral and development economics. Empirically, labor contracts that financially penalize failure induce higher effort provision than economically identical contracts presented as paying a bonus for success. This is puzzling, as penalties are infrequently used in practice. The most obvious explanation is selection: loss averse agents are unwilling to accept such contracts. In the first chapter, I formalize and experimentally test this intuition. Surprisingly, I find that workers were 25 {{percent more likely to}} accept penalty contracts, with no evidence of adverse selection. Penalty contracts also increased performance on the job by 0. 2 standard deviations. Finally, I outline extensions to the basic theory that are consistent with the main results. The second chapter analyzes the effect of market structure in microfinance on borrower welfare and the types of contracts used. We find that market power can have severe implications for borrower welfare, while despite information frictions, competition delivers similar borrower welfare to non-profit lending. We also find that for-profit lenders are less likely to use joint liability than non-profits, which is consistent with some empirical stylized facts suggesting a decline in use of joint liability. We simulate the model to evaluate quantitatively the importance of market structure for borrower welfare. The third chapter contrasts individual liability lending with and without groups to <b>joint</b> <b>liability</b> <b>lending,</b> motivated by an apparent shift away from <b>joint</b> <b>liability</b> <b>lending.</b> We show under what conditions individual liability can deliver welfare improvements over joint liability, conditions that depend on the joint income distribution and social capital.
