500|$|Not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino {{has lately}} {{become the focus}} {{for this sort of}} {{criticism}} (about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence). The fact that Django Unchained arrived in theaters right {{around the time of the}} Sandy Hook massacre didn't help. Yet he has refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life. Obviously I don't think one has to do with the other. Movies are about make-believe. It's about imagination. Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience, but we are faking it. Is it possible that anyone in our cynical world credits a self-serving sophistry like this?

2500|$|Initial {{reaction}} to the album from music critics was highly favorable. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, writing, [...] "Naturally, {{there is quite a}} bit of roiling darkness here -- they're Cure-loving metalheads, it's in their blood -- but there's shade and light, control of texture, with the band deepening rather than expanding." [...] Jason Pettigrew of Alternative Press also awarded the album 4 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "Unlike their alleged 'peers' (<b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> have any?), Deftones learned years ago that a whisper can be more terrifying than a scream and power isn't always about BPMs and downstrokes per minute." [...] He also added that Diamond Eyes [...] "belongs in a pantheon of amazing albums born from tragedy". BBC writer Mike Diver was also impressed, and opined that the album [...] "knocks every pretender to the band's throne into the middle of next week". He praised the band for playing to their strengths, and summarized: [...] "Eros is reportedly their excursion into weirdness, while this is a statement of consolidation, a neatly segued set that finds Deftones playing to their well-established strengths." ...|$|E

40|$|Extract] Many expeditions set {{out from}} Europe in the 18 ᵗʰ and 19 ᵗʰ centuries to {{discover}} new plants and animals. Some of them, {{such as that of}} Alexander von Humboldt, brought specimens back to Europe and employed artists so that their discoveries could be published.

I do not mean to depreciate music: let it be loved and [...] reverenced as is just; only let the delight of the eye be reverenced [...] more. The great power of music over the multitude is owing, not to [...] its being less but more sensual than color; it is so distinctly [...] and so richly sensual, that it can be idly enjoyed; it is exactly at [...] the point where the lower and higher pleasures of the senses and [...] imagination are balanced; so that pure and great minds love it for [...] its invention and emotion, and lower minds for its sensual power.|$|E

60|$|Several eminent naturalists have of late {{published}} {{their belief}} that a multitude of reputed species in each genus are not real species; but that other species are real, that is, have been independently created. This {{seems to me a}} strange conclusion to arrive at. They admit that a multitude of forms, which till lately they themselves thought were special creations, and which are still thus looked at by the majority of naturalists, and which consequently have every external characteristic feature of true species,--they admit that these have been produced by variation, but they refuse to extend the same view to other and very slightly different forms. Nevertheless they do not pretend that they can define, or even conjecture, which are the created forms of life, and which are those produced by secondary laws. They admit variation as a vera causa in one case, they arbitrarily reject it in another, without assigning any distinction in the two cases. The day will come when this will be given as a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceived opinion. These authors seem no more startled at a miraculous act of creation than at an ordinary birth. But <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> believe that at innumerable periods in the earth's history certain elemental atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues? Do they believe that at each supposed act of creation one individual or many were produced? Were all the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants created as eggs or seed, or as full grown? {{and in the case of}} mammals, were they created bearing the false marks of nourishment from the mother's womb? Although naturalists very properly demand a full explanation of every difficulty from those who believe in the mutability of species, on their own side they ignore the whole subject of the first appearance of species in what they consider reverent silence.|$|E
60|$|Here is {{a puzzle}} for ornithologists. In summer on the pampas {{we have a}} godwit--Limosa hudsonica; in March it goes north to breed; {{later in the season}} flocks of the same species arrive from the south to winter on the pampas. And besides this godwit, there are several other North American species, which have colonies in the {{southern}} hemi-spere, with a reversed migration and breeding season. Why do these southern birds winter so far south? <b>Do</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> breed in Patagonia? If so, their migration is an extremely limited one compared with that of the northern birds--seven or eight hundred miles, on the outside, in one case, against almost as many thousands of miles in the other. Considering that some species which migrate as far south as Patagonia breed in the Arctic regions as far north as latitude 82 degrees, and probably higher still, it would be strange indeed if none of the birds which winter in Patagonia and on the pampas were summer visitors to that great austral continent, which has an estimated area twice as large as that of Europe, and a climate milder than the arctic one. The migrants would have about six hundred miles of sea to cross from Tierra del Fuego; but we know that the golden plover and other species, which sometimes touch at the Bermudas when travelling, fly much further than that without resting. The fact that a common Argentine titlark, a non-migrant and a weak flyer, has been met with at the South Shetland Islands, close to the antarctic continent, shows that the journey may be easily accomplished by birds with strong flight; and that even the winter climate of that unknown land is not too severe to allow an accidental colonist, like this small delicate bird, to survive. The godwit, already mentioned, has been observed in flocks at the Falkland Islands in May, that is, three months after the same species had taken its autumal departure from the neighbouring mainland. Can it be believed that these late visitors to the Falklands were breeders in Patagonia, and had migrated east to winter in so bleak a region? It is far more probable that they came from the south. Officers of sailing ships beating round Cape Horn might be able to settle this question definitely by looking out, and listening at night, for flights of birds, travelling north from about the first week in January to the end of February; and in September and October travelling south. Probably not fewer than a dozen species of the plover order are breeders on the great austral continent; also other aquatic birds--ducks and geese; and many Passerine birds, chiefly of the Tyrant family.|$|E
