5000|$|An <b>infopreneur</b> is an {{entrepreneur}} who identifies opportunities for creating enterprising information-based businesses by identifying knowledge deficiency situations and selling target-based information products and services, mainly through the internet. An <b>Infopreneur</b> {{can also be}} understood to be a person, or a person running a bot, whose primary business is gathering and selling electronic information. In spite of the preceding reference, there are many examples of Infopreneurs who are selling content in Paperback or Hardback book form on the Internet. <b>Infopreneur</b> is a neologism portmanteau derived from the words [...] "information" [...] and [...] "entrepreneur".|$|E
50|$|As the <b>Infopreneur</b> is his/her own developer, marketer, producer, and {{distributor}} - some infopreneurs {{consider themselves}} {{being in the}} publishing business. Unlike in traditional print publishing, the <b>Infopreneur</b> puts down, in electronic form (usually), what he/she knows from experience or what he/she learned and passes the conttnhon to the world through publishing on websites, blogs, ebooks, emails, etc..|$|E
50|$|Godefroy's books {{included}} Mind Dynamics, How {{to write}} a letter that sells, Time management System, Expressive learning system and <b>Infopreneur.</b> He also started a publishing company and founded CORESPRIT, an annual gathering of self-improvement motivators.|$|E
50|$|Information traffickers do {{consider}} themselves <b>infopreneurs.</b> After all, {{they are making}} money out of information. Many of them utilize {{the power of the}} World Wide Web - creating websites and blogs to act as their storefront.|$|R
50|$|The {{impact of}} these <b>infopreneurs</b> has alsohad a {{disruptive}} impact by slicing through thetraditional publication industry that involvesagents, publishers, distribution channels, andretailers. As a result, entrepreneurial firms have emerged to serve artists and authors {{who want to be}} self-published. Other self-publishing groups include the Nonfiction Authors Association.|$|R

We {{would also like to thank}} Dell Foundation for donating the necessary equipment for our first 50 <b>Infopreneurs</b> ™ in South Africa. Lastly we would also like to acknowledge the patience (and support) of our colleagues in both the Meraka Institute and the broader CSIR whilst we have been travelling along a road where the “science and technology outcomes ” are not always clear and predictable...|$|R
5000|$|The term {{is often}} used on the Internet. The word <b>infopreneur</b> was {{registered}} as a trademark (USPTO) on February 1, 1984, by Harold F. Weitzen. In 1988, H. Skip Weitzen published [...] "Infopreneurs: Turning Data Into Dollars" [...] (John Wiley & Sons).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>infopreneur</b> may attract {{traffic to}} his/her site by {{manipulating}} their site to appear higher on search engine results. This may {{be done by}} creating a site that is robust in information, and configuring META keywords and descriptions that accurately describe the web page. More often, infopreneurs who are out to get a [...] "quick buck" [...] will create a mash-together of information by publishing popular, sought after content, often incorporating RSS feeds from more popular sites. The <b>infopreneur</b> then makes money from AdSense ads, affiliate links, referrals and leads, and/or selling ebooks {{that are related to}} the search parameters and keywords. Essentially, these infopreneurs [...] "piggy-back" [...] on already established information. For example, there are many such splogs that copy verbatim the articles from Wikipedia.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{explosive}} {{popularity of the}} Internet {{at the turn of}} the millennium, such an occupation already existed. These legacy infopreneurs sold their information in other mediums such as audio tapes, audio CDs, CD-ROMs, videos, talk shows, and conferences. The classification of <b>infopreneur</b> has created a new style of business on the Internet, which allows anybody with a computer and an Internet connection to start businesses by publishing information that may appeal to a specific market.|$|E

The Rural Living Lab (RLL) in Sekhukhune introduced <b>Infopreneurs</b> {{that provide a}} Collaborative Working Environment to deliver collaborative business services to the rural enterprises, based on an Open Service Oriented Architecture (Open SOA) approach. The paper provides information about the methodologies and concepts of the technical solutions developed and planned to overcome the SMMEs difficulties. The aim is to adapt the technologically advanced OSOA, used for all the RLLs in the C@R project, {{for use in the}} emerging economy circumstances specific to the South African RLL, while staying true to the needs, requirements and contexts of the local users and communities. Due to the current stage of advanced prototype development and end user interaction in the living lab this paper will already present important lessons learned and clear benefits of the C@R software approach...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In rural South Africa, due {{to their}} {{remoteness}} small and micro enterprises face difficult business conditions and are hampered by developmental impediments. Following the European Network of Living Labs (ENoLL) initiative a Rural Living Lab (RLL) is {{set up in the}} economically active region of Sekhukhune, Mpumalanga. The RLL introduces so called <b>Infopreneurs</b> that offer extended collaborative service bundles to the rural enterprises that helps them to reduce high transaction and logistics cost, to upscale supply chain volumes, to release product related market constraints and to share knowledge and know-how. In line with the principles of Living Labs a user centred co-design process is followed that provides a Collaborative Working Environment based on a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach. The technical advantages of a decoupled, multi tiered SOA approach are used to realize measurable impact on local businesses in terms of the improvement of efficiency, competitiveness, outreach to first economies, employment and human capacity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} ICT {{in the development of}} entrepreneurship and Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) in Nigeria. It considers the impact of ICT on the creation of budding <b>infopreneurs</b> sequel to the introduction of the Global System for Mobile (GSM) communication in the country. It was discovered that the introduction of GSM as a factor of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) opened up a vista of opportunities for youth empowerment and employment. Using exploratory methods, the study discovered that ICT has a major role to play in the development of start-up enterprises, most of which are novel creations in their own rights. These previously unheard of ventures created opportunities for addressing the yearnings for employment and job creation for the youth and they include such entrepreneurial ventures as the ubiquitous call centers and short-codes businesses. However, each new enterprise must transcend three local dimensional contexts to attain sustainability; ye, yan, yanju. Contexts parallelly aligned to enterprise conception, birth and persistence. It was also discovered that limiting factors such as poor access to financial assistance and poor marketing skill and orientation constitute challenges which any budding entrepreneur need to tackle to achieve sustainability of the established venture...|$|R

One {{of the more popular}} SoHo endeavours on the internet is by becoming an <b>infopreneur,</b> or a seller of digital information products through online sales letters. The success of online sales letters to garner sales depends heavily on how credible and persuasive they are. This preliminary study aims to firstly identify some successful online sales letters and then to analyse them in order to find out their persuasive features. They will be further analysed to gauge their conformance to web credibility guidelines...|$|E
