500|$|Army {{leaders say}} having a large ground army is still {{necessary}} for deterrence and [...] "regime change" [...] operations.

Technologies from the GCV program are being explored, although development and procurement of a vehicle is not. By mid-November 2013, both BAE and General Dynamics designs had passed Preliminary Design Reviews (PDR), but neither company had commenced building prototypes. The Army was increasingly willing to slow down the GCV program or push it back from EMD to research and development. While the Army had said previously that it was their highest priority acquisition program, they had since shifted their main modernization priority to an integrated electronic command network.

500|$|Domingo Faustino Sarmiento {{served as}} President of the Republic of Argentina from 1868–1874, {{becoming}} president despite the maneuverings {{of his predecessor}} Bartolomé Mitre. [...] According to biographer Allison Bunkley, his presidency [...] "marks {{the advent of the}} middle, or land-owning classes as the pivot power of the nation. [...] The age of the gaucho had ended, and the age of the merchant and cattleman had begun." [...] Sarmiento sought to create basic freedoms, and wanted to ensure civil safety and progress for everyone, not just the few. Sarmiento's tour of the United States had given him many new ideas about politics, democracy, and the structure of society, especially when he was the Argentine ambassador to the country from 1865 to 1868. He found New England, specifically the Boston-Cambridge area to be the source of much of his influence, writing in an Argentine newspaper that New England was [...] "the cradle of the modern republic, the school for all of America." [...] He described Boston as [...] "The pioneer city of the modern world, the Zion of the ancient Puritans ... Europe contemplates in New England the power which <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> supplant her." [...] Not only did Sarmiento evolve political ideas, but also structural ones by transitioning Argentina from a primarily agricultural economy to one focused on cities and industry.|$|E
500|$|When Grant {{took office}} in 1869, the nation's policy towards Indians was in chaos, with more than 250,000 Indians being governed by 370 treaties. Grant promised in his inaugural address to work toward [...] "the proper {{treatment}} of the original occupants of this land—the Indians." [...] He appointed Ely S. Parker, a Seneca Indian, {{a member of his}} wartime staff, as Commissioner of Indian Affairs, the first Native American to serve in this position. With his familiarity of Indian life, Parker became the chief architect of Grant's Peace Policy. In April 1869, Grant signed a law establishing a Board of Indian Commissioners to oversee spending and reduce corruption in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1871, he signed a bill ending the Indian treaty system; the law now treated individual Native Americans as wards of the federal government, and no longer dealt with the tribes as sovereign entities. Grant believed that Indians, given opportunities for education and work, could serve alongside white men. His Peace Policy aimed to replace entrepreneurs serving as Indian agents with missionaries and aimed to protect Indians on reservations and educate them in farming. [...] "My efforts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> be directed," [...] Grant said in his second inaugural address, [...] "by a humane course, to bring the aborigines of the country under the benign influences of education and civilization... Wars of extermination... are demoralizing and wicked." ...|$|E

The impacts of the spike on poor people were concentrated in low-income countries and may have been less severe than once thought, thanks to rising rural wages in some countries. The researchers called on developing countries to ensure good data on the key indicators of distress and to strengthen social protection, and on those involved in international development to continue increasing focus on reducing child malnutrition and stimulating agricultural development.|$|E

[...] In October 2011, Dick Pound criticized the organization, saying, [...] "FIFA has fallen far short of a credible demonstration that it recognizes the many problems it faces, that it has the will to solve them, that it is willing to be transparent about what it is doing and what it finds, and that its conduct <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> be such that the public can be confident in the governance of the sport." ...|$|E

2500|$|As a commentator, Miller {{became known}} for his {{straightforward}} and sometimes blunt remarks, which sometimes earned him the enmity of players. One example came on June 16, 2008, when he referred to Rocco Mediate, during the broadcast of the U.S. Open's 18-hole playoff, as [...] "looking like the guy who cleans Tiger Woods' pool." [...] Miller said that [...] "guys {{with the name of}} Rocco don't get on the trophy, do they?" [...] Mediate, who has battled many physical problems throughout his career, nevertheless played superbly, and took the heavily favored Woods to an 18-hole playoff (and one extra sudden-death hole) before losing. Mediate later laughed off the remarks and Miller later apologized for his comments, saying: [...] "I chose my words poorly and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> be more careful." [...] He added that his intention was to [...] "convey my affection and admiration for Rocco's everyman qualities and had {{absolutely nothing to do with}} his heritage." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{statement}} about {{the outcome of the}} vote issued on 14 March, Crabb explained: [...] "What this actually means is that those individuals who are considered {{to be able to work}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> now access the same level of benefit as those on Jobseekers Allowance, but will be given better tailored support to help them into employment. It doesn't affect those already claiming ESA. Of course we are protecting those that are 'too ill to work'. There is no question about that." [...] Three days later, Crabb claimed on his Facebook page that [...] "only those who are fit to work and actively seeking work are included in the work-related activity group". His post had to be amended: the work-related activity group contains ESA claimants deemed 'too ill to work' but capable of participating in work-related activities, such as job-coaching and pre-employment training, who are assessed as likely to work within two years, not immediately.|$|E
2500|$|Edgar Percival's {{aircraft}} were {{renowned for}} their graceful lines and outstanding performance. As a noted test pilot, Percival continued to fly his own creations; in 1935, he flew a Gull from England to Morocco {{and back to}} England, winning the Oswald Watt Gold Medal. He was the first pilot to fly from Britain to Africa and back in one day. He left Gravesend at 1.30am and returned to Croydon at 6.20pm. [...] "Day trips <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>will</b> be as commonplace as trips to Margate" [...] {{he said in a}} broadcast at nine o'clock. Other famous aviators were associated with Percival aircraft; in 1933, Charles Kingsford Smith flew a Percival Gull Four named Miss Southern Cross from England to Australia in the record breaking time of 7 days, 4 hours and 44 minutes. [...] The New Zealand aviator, Jean Batten, also used the Percival Gull to fly from England to Australia in October 1936. A pure racing derivative of the Gull series, the Percival Mew Gull flown by other illustrious pilots such as Alex Henshaw and Tom Campbell Black would go on to set many speed and distance records in the 1930s.|$|E
