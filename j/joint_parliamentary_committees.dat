40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Deliberation, as {{a mode of}} {{interaction}} based on the logic of reason-giving argumentation, is a core feature of the European Union institutions. Yet only few studies have explored the conditions that make deliberation possible in practice. This study examines the institutional determinants of deliberation within <b>joint</b> <b>parliamentary</b> <b>committees</b> (JPCs) – longstanding instruments of EU enlargement policy. The empirical analysis reveals a dynamic relationship between ‘deliberation’ and ‘debate’ as extreme modes of interaction that co-exist within the same setting. It also suggests that deliberation is a product of participants’ constant efforts to maintain equal power relations and low issue-area sensitivity. This study provides new evidence on deliberative politics at the EU level. In addition, it highlights the role of inter-parliamentary deliberation as a catalyst for political co-operation and policy co-ordination, at a time of intensifying enlargement fatigue and growing Euroscepticism both at home and abroad...|$|E

40|$|The Indian Parliament {{sets up the}} <b>Joint</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Committees</b> (JPC) only on {{critical}} issues of public interest. Only five such committees have been formed {{in the history of}} independent India. The JPC formed on Pesticide Residues in and Safety Standards for Soft Drinks, Fruit Juices and Other Beverages, in 2003, was the fourth and the only committee to have been set up on public health issue.

The committee was to review the veracity of the CSE study and to suggest the criteria for evolving standards on soft drinks, fruit juices and other beverages. CSE was vindicated {{and in the course of}} evolving standards on pesticide residues in soft drinks, fruit juices and beverages, the committee found loopholes in the pesticides regulations as well as their implementation. In 2005, the JPC set out a clear agenda for governments to ensure the safe use of pesticides. The committee recommended to make mandatory the setting of maximum residue limits (MRL) for pesticides before registering it, setting MRLs for deemed registered pesticides, reviewing the set MRLs for compliance with the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of pesticides and monitoring pesticide residues regularly. The paper reviews the state of pesticide regulations in India from a food safety perspective in the light o...|$|E
