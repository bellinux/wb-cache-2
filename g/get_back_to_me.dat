500|$|Allegations of sexism {{occurred}} {{following a}} statement by Lino DiSalvo, the film's head of animation, who said to Fan Voice's Jenna Busch: [...] "Historically speaking, animating female characters are really, really difficult, {{because they have to}} go through these range of emotions, but you have to keep them pretty." [...] However, a Disney spokesperson later told Time that DiSalvo's quote was widely misinterpreted, stating that he was [...] "describing some technical aspects of CG animation and not making a general comment on animating females versus males or other characters." [...] Director Lee also said that DiSalvo's words were recklessly taken out of context, and that he was talking in very technical terms about CG animation. [...] "It is hard no matter what the gender is. I felt horrible for him," [...] she said. In an August 2014 interview, DiSalvo re-emphasized what he had been trying to explain all along when his statements were taken out of context– the difficulty with turning any kind of animated character from a series of sketches on a 2D emotion model sheet into a properly rigged 3D character model: [...] "Translating that emotional range onto a CG character {{is one of the most}} difficult parts of the process. Male. Female. Snowman. Animal." [...] He added, [...] "The really sad thing is people took that... catchy headline and they just repopulated it everywhere. People didn't <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> for comments and the sad thing is that's the way the internet works. They don't want the truth." ...|$|E

Wales & Celtic midfielder Joe Ledley who is also a close friend of Gabbidon, has also called for the West Ham man to return to the international fold. Ledley told his Twitter site: [...] "I think my best mate in football Danny Gabbidon should come out of retirement and play for Wales. We need him." ...|$|E

Five months later, he showed up to a charity event I was at, came up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and introduced himself.

5000|$|While he {{achieved}} his goals through {{hard work and}} discipline, he also received invaluable advice in getting over his 50 job rejections that were biased against his homelessness. It is not discussed whether job seekers facing other types of bias know how to overcome many job rejections. From a February 16, 2008, interview from NPR, Shepard admits, [...] "you know, I was sitting there, and I was not really happy that I had passed out 50 applications, and nobody was <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and he just went nuts, and he said listen, Adam, you are a homeless dude. Nobody looks at your application—you know because I had my homeless shelter as my address—nobody looks at that and says hey, yeah, I want to hire Adam Shepard, the homeless guy." ...|$|R

Then, when we were almost done recording the album, she called. She had it translated and adapted to her, but she also wanted to sing some parts in Italian, which is even more surprising”.|$|E
5000|$|Several of this album's tracks {{had been}} {{recorded}} by other artists, including {{two of the}} singles: [...] "Summertime Blues" [...] is a cover of the pop standard made famous by Eddie Cochran, while [...] "Song for the Life" [...] was recorded by several artists, including writer Rodney Crowell, whose version {{can be found on}} his 1977 debut Ain't Living Long Like This. In addition, [...] "Thank God for the Radio" [...] was a Number One hit in 1984 for The Kendalls from their album Movin' Train. Jackson re-recorded [...] "Let's <b>Get</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> and You" [...] for his 2013 release, The Bluegrass Album.|$|E
5000|$|The Bluegrass Album is {{the nineteenth}} studio album, {{and the first}} {{bluegrass}} album by American country music artist Alan Jackson. It was released on September 24, 2013 via Alan's Country Records and EMI Nashville. Jackson wrote eight songs for the album. It also includes covers of The Dillards' [...] "There Is a Time", John Anderson's [...] "Wild and Blue" [...] and Bill Monroe's [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky". Also included is a re-recording of [...] "Let's <b>Get</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> and You" [...] from his 1994 album Who I Am, marking the second time Jackson has included {{two versions of the}} same song on two different albums ("A Woman's Love" [...] was originally recorded for High Mileage and was later re-recorded for Like Red on a Rose).|$|E

5000|$|Due to Barbara's great form, he {{had been}} heavily linked with a move to the MLS or another high level league. Due to a MLS {{discovery}} claim, the rights to sign Barbara in MLS belonged to Montreal Impact through the 2012 season meaning that the club {{would be the only}} team in MLS able to sign him unless Montreal trades his rights, according to the league's discovery process. In an interview on 10 January 2012 Barbara revealed that talks with Montreal had stalled because he did not feel Montreal's contract offer was fair and that the club was stalling in signing him. Of the situation, Barbara said, [...] "I felt they were wasting time because they were signing other players but they were in no rush <b>to</b> sign <b>me</b> because they already own my rights. They just weren’t <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It was frustrating....Now we are in January and as far as I'm concerned we are just wasting time. Plus, I can't talk to any other team because they own me. The problem is in the rules. America has everything that any other country in any other sport should envy. You have facilities and everything in your favor and then you have rules like that. Montreal made me a bad offer. Look, I've scored 20 goals and had 9 assists and I won the best player of the league. And for what? For nothing in America. Because I'm stuck with Montreal and they don't want to pay good money. From what I understand, they are just holding my rights {{to try to get the}} best offer from somebody else. How can Montreal own my rights without even talking <b>to</b> <b>me</b> or paying me anything? If they don't want me they should just release me but obviously they want money for me. But who gives the right for that club <b>to</b> own <b>me?</b> That happens only in America. <b>To</b> own <b>me</b> without even talking <b>to</b> <b>me</b> or paying any money to me?" ...|$|R
60|$|Commencement of a gossipy {{travelling}} {{letter in}} a New York city paper, May 10, 1879.--My month's visit is about up; but before I <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Camden let <b>me</b> print some jottings {{of the last}} four weeks. Have you not, reader dear, among your intimate friends, some one, temporarily absent, whose letters to you, avoiding all the big topics and disquisitions, give only minor, gossipy sights and scenes--just as they come--subjects disdain'd by solid writers, but interesting to you because they were such as happen to everybody, and were the moving entourage to your friend--to his or her steps, eyes, mentality? Well, with an idea something of that kind, I suppose, I set out on the following hurrygraphs of a breezy early-summer visit to New York city and up the North river--especially at present of some hours along Broadway.|$|R
5000|$|Writing for RogerEbert.com, Glenn Kenny {{gave the}} film of 3 out of 4 stars, saying: [...] "Fist Fight stands up, {{at least a}} little bit, for storytelling". In contrast, Richard Roeper gave the film zero out of four stars, saying, [...] "I could tell you to sit through Fist Fight and then <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> — but I like you, so I’m not going to urge you to subject {{yourself}} to 91 minutes of cinematic detention that felt twice as long and was so ugly, so mean-spirited, so bereft of laughs, I found myself rooting for a technical malfunction if only to catch a momentary breather." [...] British film critic Mark Kermode wrote, [...] "Shoddily written, screechingly performed, crude, crass, endurance-testing... It's utter, utter, utter rubbish." ...|$|E

6000|$|A {{series of}} studies of negroes alone would form a picturebook, delightfully grotesque. Mounting my donkey to-day, I took {{a ride to the}} desolate noble old {{buildings}} outside the city, known as the Tombs of the Caliphs. Every one of these edifices, with their domes, and courts, and minarets, is strange and beautiful. In one of them there was an encampment of negro slaves newly arrived: some scores of them were huddled against the sunny wall; two or three of their masters lounged about the court, or lay smoking upon carpets. There was one of these fellows, a straight-nosed ebony- faced Abyssinian, with an expression of such sinister good-humour in his handsome face as would form a perfect type of villany. He sat leering at me, over his carpet, as I endeavoured to get a sketch of that incarnate rascality. [...] "Give me some money," [...] said the fellow. [...] "I know what you are about. You will sell my picture for money when you <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Europe; let <b>me</b> have some of it now!" [...] But the very rude and humble designer was quite unable to depict such a consummation and perfection of roguery; so flung him a cigar, which he began to smoke, grinning at the giver. I requested the interpreter to inform him, by way of assurance of my disinterestedness, that his face was a great deal too ugly to be popular in Europe, and that was the particular reason why I had selected it.|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} conducted after the finale show, Woods spoke with BE Entertained Magazine journalist Phonz L. Thomas. Woods {{was asked about}} an alleged rivalry between her and ex-Danity Kane member Dawn Richard. Woods replied, [...] "I don't know {{if she has a}} problem with me [...] I don't know why she would have a problem. I was very disappointed by {{a lot of the things}} that she did say in the media and her different interviews. People are kind of aware of her comments and then also of course on the show, those comments were definitely going to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I was really disappointed and I don't know why she would go that route. And if it was to depict her as the victim and everybody else is the bad guy… I don't really know where all that stems from, but to me it's like she has her situation. And as you guys saw, I congratulated her as I was walking out the door! So it was like I don't have a problem and I don't know why she would have a problem… but she might, I'm not sure." [...] Woods went on during this interview to comment, [...] "I don't have any animosity towards any of the girls. Like things happen for a reason, it's time to move on you know, chapter ends. People are in each other's lives for a reason and a season, as they say! So there's no reason to hold any grudges. Um, however - the way that you present yourself, the actions you take, the comments that you make can lend themselves to having a 'beef' or having animosity." ...|$|E
40|$|The time {{demands of}} {{academic}} life are examined, drawing {{on data from}} a large national sample of faculty. I outline the divide between full-time faculty, who work long hours irrespective of rank or institution type, and part-time faculty, who work at low pay with little job security, status, recognition, or fringe benefits. The expectations of academic life in dual-career couples are hard to reconcile {{with the demands of}} parenting. This is a common problem because assistant professors are generally too old to wait until they have tenure to have children. The segmentation of academic life into an overworked core and a marginalized periphery tends to perpetuate gender inequality. KEY WORDS: working time; work–family conflict; gender inequality; faculty workload; glass ceiling. We work too hard. Yes, I know that sounds like a funny thing to say, especially coming from me, because you have just heard about how many articles and books I have written and because I have worked so hard at organizing this year’s Eastern Sociological Society meetings. And it is ironic to hear such an assertion at this particular moment, since here we all are on a Saturday evening attending yet another presentation. But that indeed {{is going to be the}} theme of my talk. We work too hard. By “we ” I mean full-time faculty at academic insti-tutions. Many of my friends and acquaintances in academia find it difficult to keep their working lives under control.
