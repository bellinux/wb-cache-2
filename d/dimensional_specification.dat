30|$|The {{past two}} decades have seen the {{realization}} of the manufacturing firms towards quality consciousness. In pursuit of quality, the main concerns for alloy wheel machining process areas follows: alloy wheel unclean, surface finish deterioration, non-conformance to geometric and <b>dimensional</b> <b>specification,</b> over hump diameter over size or undersize. The spoke profile and rim profile not as per the requirement lead to non-optimal weight and pre-mature wheel failure in the radial fatigue test. Over used machining inserts result in surface finish deterioration and a patchy surface in the paint line. The prime concern in machining is the problem of unclean leading to rework. Hence, aluminum alloy wheel machining constitutes an important area of study for improvement of process capability. In this process more prominence is laid on prevention of defects rather than simply detecting and rejecting the defect in the usual traditional end inspection quality check.|$|E

This study was undertaken to experimentally determine if a non-conventional noise cancellation technique would be effective in improving automotive intake noise. It is known that a noise source can be attenuated by cancelling the acoustic signal with another 2 ̆ 7 opposite 2 ̆ 7 noise signal, usually generated by a speaker. The approach taken in this investigation was to cancel the intake noise of an automotive engine by using exhaust noise as the dynamic noise source.

Since those trials were undertaken with the thermal characteristics of the air clamped, survival uncertainty persisted if the internal ambient conditions were progressively changing, as would occur within an air-tight shelter. Therefore, two further investigations were performed. In the first, changes in the physical properties of air within an air-tight shelter simulator (1. 2 m 3), initially equilibrated to 43. 7 °C and 42. 3 % relative humidity, were studied when pre-heated, well-hydrated males were sealed inside (N[*]=[*] 16; 60 min; experimental series 2). Air temperature and humidity moved sigmoidally to 40. 5 °C (standard deviation (SD), 0. 5) and 90. 1 % (SD, 2. 1). Oxygen and carbon dioxide fractional concentrations changed reciprocally, with respective terminal averages of 16. 7 % (SD, 0. 8) and 3. 94 % (SD, 0. 72). Deep-body temperature rose beyond the tenth minute to a terminal mean of 39. 3 °C (SD, 0. 2). In the third experimental series, these air temperature and humidity changes were reproduced in trials commencing at two different thermal states (40 °C and 70 % relative humidity; 45 °C and 50 % relative humidity). Sixteen pre-heated and slightly dehydrated men and women were investigated. In neither condition did the auditory canal temperature of any individual change by more than 2 °C or exceed 40 °C.

Automated edge finishing of crossholes has been practiced successfully using robot-assisted, flexible abrasive brush deburring, and non-traditional, mass finishing {{methods such as}} electrochemical deburring (ECD), abrasive slurry, and thermal deburring. These methods are very efficient but most require specialized equipment and dedicated cleaning operations to remove chemicals or trapped brush bristles. The Orbitool is an on-line, localized deburring alternative to brushes recently developed by JWDone Company. The Orbitool is a mechanized cutting tool with carbide edges specifically designed for crosshole deburring. Mechanized cutting provides greater selectivity and control of <b>dimensional</b> <b>specifications</b> compared to brushing and mass finishing methods. Furthermore, it can be implemented using existing machine tool equipment and cleaning procedures. As with any deburring tool, its desired capability is burr removal in the shortest time possible while meeting dimensional and surface quality requirements.
