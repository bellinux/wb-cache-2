50|$|Lobe {{pumps are}} similar to <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> pumps in {{operation}} in that fluid flows around {{the interior of the}} casing. Unlike <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> pumps, however, the lobes do not make contact. Lobe contact is prevented by external timing gears located in the gearbox. Pump shaft support bearings are located in the gearbox, and since the bearings are out of the pumped liquid, pressure is limited by bearing location and shaft deflection.|$|E
50|$|The {{planetary}} gear driving power through direct connection or link initiates the sun gear. The sun gear then drives the {{planetary gear}}s assembled with the <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> ring to operate. The {{whole set of}} planetary gear system revolves on its own axis and along the <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> ring where the output shaft connected to the planetary carrier achieves the goal of speed reduction. A higher reduction ratio {{can be achieved by}} doubling the multiple staged gears and planetary gears.|$|E

25|$|A type of skiving that is {{analogous}} to the hobbing of <b>external</b> <b>gears</b> {{can be applied to the}} cutting of internal gears, which are skived with a rotary cutter (rather than shaped or broached).|$|R
50|$|By using a gear-shaped {{corresponding}} cutter that is rotated (in {{relation to}} a blank gear) produces the gear teeth. The cutters that are rotated are timed with the workpiece. This process produces internal <b>gears,</b> <b>external</b> <b>gears,</b> and integral gear-pinion arrangements.|$|R
50|$|Each joint {{consists}} of a 1:1 gear ratio internal/external gear pair. The tooth flanks and outer diameter of the <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> are crowned to allow for angular displacement between the two gears. Mechanically, the gears are equivalent to rotating splines with modified profiles. They are called gears because of the relatively large size of the teeth.|$|E
50|$|An <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> is {{one with}} the teeth formed on the outer surface of a {{cylinder}} or cone. Conversely, an internal gear is {{one with the}} teeth formed on the inner surface of a cylinder or cone. For bevel gears, an internal gear is one with the pitch angle exceeding 90 degrees. Internal gears do not cause output shaft direction reversal.|$|E
50|$|A {{gear bearing}} {{is a type}} of rolling-element bearing similar to an {{epicyclic}} gear. Gear bearings consist of a number of smaller 'satellite' gears which revolve around the center of the bearing along a track on the outsides of the internal and satellite gears, and {{on the inside of the}} <b>external</b> <b>gear.</b> Each gear is in between two concentric rings. Therefore, the widths of the satellite gears must all be the same.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} reduce volume of robot actuator, a novel gear meshing motor with three phase poles was presented. The rotors and <b>external</b> <b>gears</b> are {{connected}} as one part by which the <b>external</b> <b>gears</b> are driven meshing with fixed internal ring gear to output big torque. The torque is convenient to be controlled for its separated magnetic poles without magnetic coupling. The operation principle and magnetic field characteristics were analyzed and the control method was introduced. The finite element software Ansof. Maxwell is used to simulate and calculate the flux linkage where rotor was at different positions, and the static torque obtained directly through magnetic coenergy method. The simulation results verify that output torque of designed motor can reach 1. 9 Nm under 4 A current...|$|R
50|$|For reliability, {{it is rare}} to use an {{external}} drive mechanism, either a separate belt drive or <b>external</b> <b>gears,</b> although camshaft-driven pumps often rely on the same timing belt. Additional separate belts are sometimes used where dry sump pumps {{have been added to}} engines during tuning.|$|R
50|$|A {{gear shaper}} is a machine tool for cutting {{the teeth of}} {{internal}} or <b>external</b> <b>gears.</b> The name shaper relates {{to the fact that}} the cutter engages the part on the forward stroke and pulls away from the part on the return stroke, just like the clapper box on a planer shaper.|$|R
50|$|Gear {{pumps are}} also {{widely used in}} {{chemical}} installations to pump high viscosity fluids. There are two main variations; <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> pumps which use two external spur gears, and internal gear pumps which use an external and an internal spur gears (internal spur gear teeth face inwards, see below). Gear pumps are positive displacement (or fixed displacement), meaning they pump a constant amount of fluid for each revolution. Some gear pumps are designed to function as either a motor or a pump.|$|E
50|$|Many {{variations}} exist, including; helical and {{herringbone gear}} sets (instead of spur gears), lobe shaped rotors similar to Roots blowers (commonly used as superchargers), and mechanical designs {{that allow the}} stacking of pumps. The most common variations are shown below (the drive gear is shown blue and the idler is shown purple).File:Gear pump.png| <b>External</b> <b>gear</b> pump design for hydraulic power applications.

50|$|The {{planetary}} gear housing features <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> teeth {{and can be}} rotated by a motor and worm gear. Alteration of the housing position allows rotation of the output sun gear independently of the input sun gear position. I.e. if the driver were to hold the steering wheel (and therefore the input sun gear) stationary, driving the {{planetary gear}} housing {{will result in the}} rotation of the steering pinion (and therefore a steering action at the front wheels). By manipulating the position of the planetary gear housing, the active steering ECU can synthesize a variable steering ratio or generate steering actions independently of the driver.|$|E
50|$|A {{full chain}} guard also keeps {{the drive train}} (chain and <b>external</b> <b>gears)</b> clean and {{efficient}} by excluding water, mud, and grit which could splash onto the chain and front chainring, increase wear, and reduce drivetrain efficiency. To repair a rear flat tire, a fully enclosed chain guard must be partially disassembled to remove the back wheel, or the tire must be repaired in-place without removing the wheel.|$|R
50|$|The {{cutting tool}} is also gear shaped {{having the same}} pitch as the gear to be cut. However number of cutting teeth must be {{less than that of}} the gear to be cut for {{internal}} <b>gears.</b> For <b>external</b> <b>gears</b> the number of teeth on the cutter is limited only {{by the size of the}} shaping machine.For larger gears the blank is sometimes gashed to the rough shape to make shaping easier.|$|R
50|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of these engines was {{their use of}} <b>external</b> valve <b>gear.</b> Using <b>external</b> cylinders, valve <b>gear</b> and Walschaerts valve gear rather than Stephenson link were all features of the same post-war trends that also appeared in the BR Standard classes, but they were largely alien to traditional industrial saddle tanks.|$|R

50|$|To machine a {{helical gear}} on a manual machine, a true {{indexing}} fixture must be used. Indexing fixtures can disengage the drive worm, and be attached via an <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> train {{to the machine}} table's handle (like a power feed). It then operates similarly to a carriage on a lathe. As the table moves on the X axis, the fixture will rotate in a fixed ratio with the table. The indexing fixture itself receives {{its name from the}} original purpose of the tool: moving the table in precise, fixed increments. If the indexing worm is not disengaged from the table, one can move the table in a highly controlled fashion via the indexing plate to produce linear movement of great precision (such as a vernier scale).|$|E
50|$|The most {{familiar}} kinds of bevel gears have pitch angles {{of less than}} 90 degrees and therefore are cone-shaped. This type of bevel <b>gear</b> is called <b>external</b> because the <b>gear</b> teeth point outward. The pitch surfaces of meshed <b>external</b> bevel <b>gears</b> are coaxial with the gear shafts; the apexes of the two surfaces are {{at the point of}} intersection of the shaft axes.|$|R

5000|$|The {{workpiece}} mounts on a rigid, box-shaped {{table in}} front of the machine. The height of the table can be adjusted to suit this workpiece, and the table can traverse sideways underneath the reciprocating tool, which is mounted on the ram. Table motion may be controlled manually, but is usually advanced by an automatic feed mechanism acting on the feedscrew. The ram slides back and forth above the work. At {{the front end of the}} ram is a vertical tool slide that may be adjusted to either side of the vertical plane along the stroke axis. This tool-slide holds the clapper box [...] and tool post, from which the tool can be positioned to cut a straight, flat surface on the top of the workpiece. The tool-slide permits feeding the tool downwards to deepen a cut.

50|$|A {{gear motor}} (<b>external</b> <b>gear)</b> {{consists}} of two gears, the driven gear (attached to the output shaft {{by way of a}} key, etc.) and the idler gear. High pressure oil is ported into one side of the gears, where it flows around the periphery of the gears, between the gear tips and the wall housings in which it resides, to the outlet port. The gears then mesh, not allowing the oil from the outlet side to flow back to the inlet side. For lubrication, the gear motor uses a small amount of oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the motor housing. An especially positive attribute of the gear motor is that catastrophic breakdown is less common than in most other types of hydraulic motors. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the motor gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|E

50|$|As {{the truck}} {{features}} a straight-axle arrangement, the TXT-1 is particularly adept at RC-scale rock crawling. In short, the straight-axle system allows the entire axle and chassis to better articulate itself over obstructions while efficiently conforming tire contact patches to the ground. As an aside, the wide gear contact patches and durable axle construction make the TXT-1 a very durable platform for either high-torque crawling applications or overall high-power brushed or brushless applications. The truck performs {{very well with}} no modifications required {{on a variety of}} surfaces, however some choose to lock differentials, change tire and wheel packages, reduce motor shaft-mounted pinion gear tooth count, mount the shock absorbers directly to the chassis and axle (thereby deleting the cantilever assembly), and reducing parts count and relocating electronic components to reduce weight and make the vehicle's weight distribution more advantageous for rock crawling. Advanced setups include cutting the lower portion of the chassis, changing the motor arrangement significantly (single motor setup with an <b>external</b> <b>gear</b> reduction unit), or changing the length of suspension links to modify caster angles and distances between axles and the chassis.|$|E
