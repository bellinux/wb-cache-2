5|$|Chinese forces counterattacked, {{destroying}} a 3rd Infantry Division {{tank column}} sent {{to assist the}} Rangers and attacking the 3rd Ranger Company from three sides, as they dug into a hill. Though the Rangers eventually were forced to withdraw, {{the defense of the}} Rangers, the US 3rd Division and the British 29th Brigade <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> momentum of the Chinese offensive.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> Peace of Amiens {{by declaring}} war on France in May 1803. In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish {{agreement}} {{became the first}} step towards {{the creation of the}} Third Coalition. By April 1805, Britain had also signed an alliance with Russia. Austria had been defeated by France twice in recent memory and wanted revenge, so it joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E

Wellington was awarded with a Marshal's baton– partially designed by the Prince Regent himself– {{the first of its kind}} in the British Army.|$|E
5|$|Bayliss's counsel, Rufus Isaacs, called Starling as {{his first}} witness. Starling {{admitted}} that he <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> law by using the dog twice, but {{said that he had}} done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that the dog had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E

5|$|McLeod's {{most notable}} and {{controversial}} appearance {{came during the}} 2012 Summer Olympics in London. In the semi-final match against the United States on August 6, the referee ruled that McLeod <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> six-second handling rule in the 76th minute, when Canada was leading 3–2. A free kick {{was given to the}} United States which resulted in a penalty being called on Canadian player Marie-Ève Nault after the ball struck her in the arm. The United States was given a penalty kick, which McLeod did not save. The United States ultimately won the game in overtime, eliminating Canada's chance for the gold medal.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the U-boats in the mid-Atlantic and their withdrawal, meant the Bay of Biscay became {{congested}} with German submarines seeking refuge. Thus, AOC Slessor revisited the interdiction strategy which had been tried, and failed in 1941 and 1943. This time, there were crucial differences. Firstly, the improvement of radar had enhanced detection of submarines, submerged and surfaced, and intelligence breakthroughs, in which the British Ultra organisation <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> naval Enigma codes and confirmed {{a major change in}} German strategy, enabled the British to focus on the Biscay.|$|E
5|$|The {{favourite}} for the men's {{race was}} Eritrean runner Zersenay Tadese (the defending champion with four straight wins), who <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> world record earlier that {{year with a}} run of 58:23 minutes at the Lisbon Half Marathon. Newly minted African Champion Wilson Kiprop was {{the most prominent of}} the Kenyan contingent, which was the clear favourite for the team title through its hoard of sub-60 minute runners including Sammy Kitwara, Silas Kipruto and Moses Mosop. Other contenders were Ethiopian Lelisa Desisa and Eritrean Samuel Tsegay. Kenya was the defending champion in the team race.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} later, he {{finished}} {{fifth in the}} 200m final {{with a time of}} 19.98seconds, some distance off the winner Usain Bolt who <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> world record. However, it transpired that both the silver and bronze medalists (Churandy Martina of the Netherlands Antilles and American Wallace Spearmon) had stepped out of their lanes thus they were disqualified. As a result, Dix received his second Olympic bronze medal. Further disqualifications occurred in the heats of the Olympic 4×100 meter relay race: Darvis Patton and Tyson Gay misjudged a baton pass, causing the American team to be eliminated and spoiling any chance of Dix receiving a relay medal. He finished the Olympics as the only American sprinter to medal in two individual events. Dix closed the season with two sub-10 second runs at the Weltklasse and Athletissima meetings, finishing second to a Jamaican on both occasions (Bolt and Asafa Powell).|$|E
5|$|An early {{strategic}} plan by Isoroku Yamamoto involved {{the occupation of}} the western Aleutians and Midway Island as a 'decoy' to lure the United States Navy's Pacific fleet away from Pearl Harbor so as to effect the complete destruction of the Hawaiian base before reconstruction efforts could take hold. However, the Aleutians campaign meant that fewer ships could be devoted to the Battle of Midway, a turning point during World War Two. The United States armed forces <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> Japanese communications code, {{and were able to}} learn of the Japanese plan to attack the Aleutians by May 21, 1942. The Imperial Japanese Navy's plan was to attack and hold Attu and Kiska for future use, while inflicting damage on Dutch Harbor and Adak. Once the United States Navy learned of the plan, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz sent a third of his Pacific Fleet to the Aleutian Islands, under orders to hold Dutch Harbor at all costs.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{network of}} allies in Normandy became {{stronger}} during 1103. Henry married Juliana, {{one of his}} illegitimate daughters, to Eustace of Breteuil, and another illegitimate daughter, Matilda, to Rotrou, the Count of Perche, on the Normandy border. Henry attempted to win over {{other members of the}} Normandy nobility and gave other English estates and lucrative offers to key Norman lords. Duke Robert continued to fight Robert of Bellême, but the Duke's position worsened, until by 1104, he had to ally himself formally with Bellême to survive. Arguing that Duke Robert <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> terms of their treaty, Henry crossed over the Channel to Domfront, where he met with senior barons from across Normandy, eager to ally themselves with the King. Henry confronted his brother and accused him of siding with his enemies, before returning to England.|$|E

At WrestleMania 32, The Rock announced that WWE <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> all-time WrestleMania attendance record before being interrupted by The Wyatt Family. The Rock defeated Wyatt Family member Erick Rowan in an impromptu match, giving him a Rock Bottom and pinning him in six seconds, which set {{the record for the}} fastest win in WrestleMania history. The Rock was then aided by the returning John Cena to fend off the remaining members of The Wyatt Family, Bray Wyatt and Braun Strowman. The Rock was announced as the executive soundtrack producer as well as the playable character for the WWE 2K18 video game on August 17, 2017.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} had traditionally {{paid little attention}} to the poor, but {{in the wake of the}} Industrial Revolution attitudes towards the accomplishments of the lower classes were changing. The growth of the railways, the mechanisation of agriculture and the need for labour in the new inner-city factories <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> traditional feudal economy and caused the rapid growth of cities, while increasing literacy rates led to a greater interest in the media and current affairs among ordinary workers. In 1856 the first military honour for bravery open to all ranks, the Victoria Cross, had been instituted, while in 1866 the Albert Medal, the first official honour open to civilians of all classes, was introduced. Additionally, a number of private and charitable organisations dedicated to lifesaving, most prominently the Royal Humane Society (1776) and Royal National Lifeboat Institution (1824), were increasing in activity and prominence, and gave awards and medals as a means of publicising their activities and lifesaving advice.|$|E
5|$|The parties {{reached a}} {{compromise}} which {{was recorded in}} the Kolozsmonostor Abbey on 6 July. They agreed that the tithe would be reduced by half. The payment of the rents, taxes and other levies due to the landowners and the royal treasury was suspended until the tithe was collected. The agreement abolished the ninth and prescribed that the peasants were only required {{to pay the rent}} to the landowners. The annual amount of the rent was fixed at 10 dinars, much lower than the rent from before the uprising. The noblemen also acknowledged the peasants' right to free movement, which could only be limited if a peasant failed to fulfill his obligations to the landowner. To keep the execution of the agreement under surveillance, the peasants were authorized to hold an annual assembly at Mount Bábolna. Their assembly was entitled to punish noblemen who <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> compromise.|$|E

5|$|The {{successes of}} the 1st Ukrainian Front during the first nine days of the battle meant that by 25 April, they were occupying large swathes of the area south and {{south-west}} of Berlin. Their spearheads had met elements of the 1st Belorussian Front west of Berlin, completing the investment of the city. Meanwhile, the 58th Guards Rifle Division of the 5th Guards Army in 1st Ukrainian Front made contact with the 69th Infantry Division (United States) of the United States First Army near Torgau, on the Elbe River. These manoeuvres <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> German forces south of Berlin into three parts. The German IX Army was surrounded in the Halbe pocket. Wenck's XII Army, obeying Hitler's command of 22 April, was attempting to force its way into Berlin from the south-west but met stiff resistance from 1st Ukrainian Front around Potsdam. Schörner's Army Group Centre was forced {{to withdraw from the}} Battle of Berlin, along its lines of communications towards Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|In 692/693, the Byzantine emperor Justinian II (reigned 685–695 and 705–711) and the Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) {{broke the}} truce that had existed between Byzantium and the Umayyad Caliphate since 679, {{following}} the failed Muslim {{attack on the}} Byzantine capital, Constantinople. The Byzantines secured great financial and territorial advantages from the truce, which they extended further by exploiting the Umayyad government's involvement in the Second Muslim Civil War (680–692). However, by 692 the Umayyads were clearly emerging as the victors in the conflict, and Abd al-Malik consciously {{began a series of}} provocations to bring about a resumption of warfare. Justinian, confident in his own strength based on his previous successes, responded in kind. Finally, the Umayyads claimed that the Byzantines <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> treaty and invaded Byzantine territory, defeating the imperial army at the Battle of Sebastopolis in 693. In its aftermath, the Arabs quickly regained control over Armenia and resumed their attacks into the border zone of eastern Asia Minor, that would culminate in the second attempt to conquer Constantinople in 716–718. Furthermore, Justinian was deposed in 695, beginning a twenty-year period of internal instability that almost brought the Byzantine state to its knees.|$|E
5|$|In March 1915, Ruth {{reported}} to Hot Springs, Arkansas {{for his first}} major league spring training. Despite a relatively successful first season, he was not slated to start regularly for the Red Sox, who already had two stellar left-handed pitchers: the established stars Dutch Leonard, who <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> <b>the</b> record for the lowest earned run average (ERA) in a single season; and Ray Collins, a 20-game winner in both 1913 and 1914. Ruth was ineffective in his first start, taking the loss in the third game of the season. Injuries and ineffective pitching by other Boston pitchers gave Ruth another chance, and after some good relief appearances, Carrigan allowed Ruth another start, and he won a rain-shortened seven inning game. Ten days later, the manager had him start against the New York Yankees at the Polo Grounds. Ruth took a 3–2 lead into the ninth, but lost the game 4–3 in 13 innings. Ruth, hitting ninth as was customary for pitchers, hit a massive home run into the upper deck in right field off of Jack Warhop. At the time, home runs were rare in baseball, and Ruth's majestic shot awed the crowd. The winning pitcher, Warhop, would in August 1915 conclude a major league career of eight seasons, undistinguished but for being the first major league pitcher {{to give up a}} home run to Babe Ruth.|$|E
