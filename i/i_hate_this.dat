500|$|Streep's {{first feature}} film role came {{opposite}} Jane Fonda in the 1977 film Julia, {{in which she}} had a small role during a flashback sequence. Most of her scenes were edited out, but the brief time on screen horrified the actress: [...] "I had a bad wig and they took the words from the scene I shot with Jane and put them in my mouth in a different scene. I thought, I've made a terrible mistake, no more movies. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> business". However, Streep cites Fonda as having a lasting influence on her as an actress, and has credited her as [...] "open probably more doors than I probably even know about".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{generally}} optimistic, Prince Henry did sometimes {{suffer from}} bouts of depression during his service in 1940, {{especially at the}} end of his occasional leaves. [...] "My beloved Alice, I did hate leaving you yesterday so very much that I could hardly keep a straight face", he wrote to his wife after reporting back. The strains of living at the French front also diminished his resolve at times: [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> country and war more than ever... it is such an awful waste of everything," [...] he told the Duchess.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kelis, she {{received}} no support from Jive Records for Kelis Was Here, and the label dropped her in late 2007. Her {{manager at the}} time said that the singer was working with Cee-Lo Green on an alternative dance album and would be shopping a pop album produced by songwriter Guy Chambers, who co-wrote hits such as Robbie Williams's [...] "Angels". Scottish electronica producer Calvin Harris was also said to be collaborating with her. Kelis later said of this period, [...] "I was like, 'I will never put out another record again, <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> business, I hate all these people.' I was in this race that I didn't even realise that I was in. I woke up and ten years had passed. That was never my plan". She subsequently took a hiatus from music.|$|E
60|$|The way Steele {{looked at}} Wright was joy to me. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>this</b> smooth, dark-skinned Southerner. But, of course, an {{ordinary}} affront like Wright's only earned silence from Steele.|$|R
60|$|My heart sank. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> all <b>this</b> incomprehensible secrecy; {{a moment}} before she had seemed so different.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a {{great relief}} to know that I was wrong--in one respect, but you must not think <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>this</b> girl because Gregory had {{preferred}} her to me," [...] she said at last. [...] "When the first shock had passed, there was an almost horrible satisfaction in feeling that he had released me--at any cost. I suppose I shall always be ashamed of that." ...|$|R
60|$|LORD CAVERSHAM. [Testily.] <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> {{affectation}} of youth, sir. It is a {{great deal}} too prevalent nowadays.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bah! Here, I {{do it for}} money; <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> place. It bores me--bores me! Was {{that your}} father sitting with you under the statue?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Inkosazana!" [...] exclaimed Rachel. [...] "I {{weary of}} that name. I am {{but a woman}} like yourself, and <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> part which I must play." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I must," [...] said Peregrine, sadly. [...] "There's {{nothing else}} for it. But if there's {{anything}} that <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> in <b>this</b> world, it's waiting." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "As much as <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> doing <b>this</b> {{to someone}} as good and original, {{if you like}} KILLDOZER and THE BUTTHOLE SURFERS, check these guys out." [...] -- Maximum Rocknroll ...|$|R
5000|$|Actually {{making movies}} was painful work, as I often {{said to my}} wife. I had already wanted to quit {{four or five years}} before. I told her <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>this</b> foolish, painful process. She told me I shouldn't say such a thing ... that if I talked that way, it would come true. And it {{eventually}} did. alludes to his unfair dismissal from Nikkatsu in 1968. For me, it was a relief. I felt this way from the very start.|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> London," [...] said Tanny. She {{was half}} Norwegian, and {{had spent a}} large part of her life in Norway, before she married Lilly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} this instant," [...] Pauline cried, {{with a sudden}} nervous passion in her tone. [...] "Come, Henry, come away. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> place. Come away quickly." ...|$|E
6000|$|MISS BAILEY. You suppose? Don't you know? Of {{course she}} did. I got to go, too. (Pulling Eileen's sleeve.) Come on. Let's {{get out of}} here. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> place, don't you? ...|$|E
60|$|In {{some ten}} minutes I slackened speed and looked back. For a long {{distance}} behind me not a bicycle was in sight. I now pursued my homeward way with a warm body and a lacerated heart. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>this</b> region which <b>I</b> had called Cathay. Its inhabitants were not barbarians, but I was suffering from their barbarities. I had come among them clean, whole, with an upright bearing. I was going away torn, bloody, and downcast.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{sooner the}} better, I say," [...] another speaker remarked. [...] "I am ready enough to fight, but <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> all <b>this</b> waiting about. I {{want to get}} back to my farm again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Paul Baker {{was looking}} {{out of the window}} at the fog, and inside the cab it was very dark, so {{he did not know what}} I was doing. I killed him, just as I had killed Arthur's son, with a dagger thrust through the neck. This time I did not feel sick, because <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>this</b> man so. When the driver pulled up near Green Park I jumped out quite coolly and told the man to take my friend to some distant address in Kensington.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This wine, great Scherirah, is excellent, or I am no true Moslem,' said a {{principal}} robber; 'but {{you are too}} cruel; <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> summary punishment. Let us torture him a little, and extract some useful information.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Confound it all! <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> world. If I {{could have}} my own way now,--if I could have just what I wanted, and do just as I please exactly, I might make a pretty good thing of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm game! I'm on to this," [...] {{he cried}} fiercely. [...] "You {{can have all}} there is coming to me, Sullivan, if I get nabbed, but I'm {{going to take my}} risk. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> hole! It's a rat's den." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. G. (Furiously.) Pip <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> you! <b>This</b> is as bad {{as those}} idiotic saddle-bags on the floor. Never mind whether it would please me or not, {{you ought to have}} given it to me to read.|$|R
50|$|Film critic Roger Ebert {{highlighted}} {{the film in}} his book <b>I</b> <b>Hated,</b> <b>Hated,</b> <b>Hated</b> <b>This</b> Movie, deriding the science in the scene where Patroni fires a flare gun out of the cockpit window.|$|R
60|$|I {{had left}} Miss Laniston without asking some {{questions}} I {{had intended to}} put to her. I wished very much to know--I thought it was my right to know--something definite about the Mr. Brownson who had formerly been connected, so to speak, with the Misses Raynor. <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> <b>this</b> subject as <b>I</b> <b>hated</b> the vilest medicine, but I felt that I must get the matter straightened in my mind, yet I could not say anything to Sylvia about it. And after what Miss Laniston had read to me I could not ask her anything, even if my mind had been sufficiently composed to formulate questions. She was a very plain-spoken person. Too much so, perhaps.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Clifford. [...] "I cannot, and I wouldn't if I could. My {{daughter is}} quite right. Moreover, <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> supernatural kind of thing. If we can't find this gold without it, {{then we must}} let it alone, that is all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Confound it!" [...] I cried, [...] "what {{you say is}} {{not only}} preposterous, but unfeeling. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> eternal making the best of things, {{when there is no}} best. With me {{everything}} is at its worst, and it is cruel {{to try to make it}} appear otherwise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] {{broke in}} Elsa, [...] "is {{there to be}} more fighting? I hoped that at last we were safe, and going {{straight}} to Leyden, where the Prince is. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> bloodshed; I tell you, Foy, it frightens me to death; I believe that I shall die of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|But its sound had revived a long {{train of}} miserable Sundays, and the {{procession}} {{would not stop}} with the bell, but continued to march on. 'Heaven forgive me,' said he, 'and those who trained me. How <b>I</b> have <b>hated</b> <b>this</b> day!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That’s what we’ve got to say," [...] said Henshaw, turning {{upon him}} suddenly. [...] "If there’s {{anything}} <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> in <b>this</b> world, it’s a drinking miser. You know our opinion, {{and the best}} thing you can do is to turn over a new leaf now." ...|$|R

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> cold, bleak {{northern}} land, [...] I fear its snow-flecked harborless strand-- [...] I fly to {{the south}} as a homing dove, [...] Back {{to the land of}} corn I love. [...] And never again shall I set my feet [...] Where the snow and the sea and the mountains meet.|$|E
6000|$|... "A viper--a fiddlestick," [...] said Miss Sharp {{to the old}} lady, almost fainting with astonishment. [...] "You took {{me because}} I was useful. There is no {{question}} of gratitude between us. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> place, and want to leave it. I will do nothing here but what I am obliged to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, la, la!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "How <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> darkness! Wait till I {{can turn}} on the lights, dear friend, and then you must embrace me. It is from outside, I believe. No, do not follow. I can find the switch for myself. Remain where you are. I return instantly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I say it's idiotic {{to apply}} your {{standards}} {{to people who}} have nothing in common with you? <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> all <b>this</b> interfering. For God's sake let us go our way; and {{if we can get a}} little pleasure out of dross and tinsel, let us keep it." ...|$|R
60|$|We steamed {{along very}} fast now. There was no {{stopping}} anywhere. I {{sat on the}} deck and thought a little, and dozed a little; {{and by the time}} it was morning, I found we were in the Savannah River. <b>I</b> now <b>hated</b> <b>this</b> river worse than ever.|$|R
