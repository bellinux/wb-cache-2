25|$|Adsorption is the {{adhesion}} of atoms, ions or molecules from a gas, liquid or <b>dissolved</b> <b>solid</b> to a surface. This process {{creates a}} film of the adsorbate {{on the surface of}} the adsorbent. This process differs from absorption, in which a fluid (the absorbate) is dissolved by or permeates a liquid or solid (the absorbent), respectively. Adsorption is a surface-based process while absorption involves the whole volume of the material. The term sorption encompasses both processes, while desorption is the reverse of it. Adsorption is a surface phenomenon.|$|E

Lowland forms are those species growing nearer to sea level. Both forms respond best to rainwater (but some tap water works {{as long as}} it is flushed monthly with rainwater or water low in <b>dissolved</b> <b>solid</b> and chemicals), bright light (though some species can grow in full sun), a well-drained medium, good air circulation and relatively high humidity, although easier species such as N.alata can adapt to lower humidity environments. Highland species must have night-time cooling to thrive in the long term. Chemical fertilisers are best used at low strength.

Various types of suspended particles (PSL, CaCO(3), and MgCO(3)) and <b>dissolved</b> <b>solids</b> (artificial seawater, NaCl, KCl, MgCl(2), and CaCl(2)) were used to evaluate the MF-DMA method. By using PSL particles of known sizes and numbers in water, a linear relationship between particle number concentrations in air (particles/cm(3)) and in water (particles/ml) was established, which was valid independent of particle size. This relationship was used to determine number concentrations of CaCO(3) and MgCO(3) particles in water, showing good agreements with the calculated values within similar to 19 %.

In higher elevations, snowmelt can cause flood conditions due to rapid snowmelt in spring and early summer.

Droughts have occurred in the basin in 1929-42, 1948-62 and 1976-82. The 1977 drought affected most the western United States and lead to decreased streamflows in the watershed.
