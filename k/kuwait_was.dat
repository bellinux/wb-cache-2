5|$|Following the Iraqi {{invasion}} of Kuwait in August 1990, No.86 Wing prepared to deploy five C-130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3,000Australian citizens from Saudi Arabia {{in the event}} that Iraq also attacked that country. An operation to fly about 95Australians and New Zealanders directly out of Iraq and <b>Kuwait</b> <b>was</b> also planned, but would have only been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved. These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq departed by road. A proposal to deploy some of the Hercules as part of Australia's contribution to the ensuing Gulf War was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of Bougainville worsened and required an evacuation operation. After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness to deploy to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February. Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to Muscat, Oman, from January 1991, and also transported a naval Clearance Diving Team to Muscat late in the month. In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved a grand total of 500,000 accident-free flying hours; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone.|$|E
25|$|Following the Kuwait–Najd War of 1919–20, Ibn Saud {{imposed a}} trade {{blockade}} against Kuwait from the years 1923 until 1937. The {{goal of the}} Saudi economic and military attacks on <b>Kuwait</b> <b>was</b> to annex as much of Kuwait's territory as possible. At the Uqair conference in 1922, the boundaries of Kuwait and Najd were set; {{as a result of}} British interference, Kuwait had no representative at the Uqair conference. Ibn Saud persuaded Sir Percy Cox to give him two-thirds of Kuwait's territory. More than half of <b>Kuwait</b> <b>was</b> lost due to Uqair. After the Uqair conference, <b>Kuwait</b> <b>was</b> still subjected to a Saudi economic blockade and intermittent Saudi raiding.|$|E

25|$|Saddam pushed oil-exporting {{countries}} to raise oil prices by cutting back production; Kuwait refused, however.

25|$|In a {{statement}} on 25 June 1961, President Abd al-Karim Qasim of Iraq claimed that <b>Kuwait</b> <b>was</b> part of his country and announced his intention to annexe it.

A force was assembled (Operation Vantage) which included armour, artillery, commando, and infantry battalions, one being the 2nd Battalion, based in Cyprus.
