25|$|In mathematics, {{the complex}} plane or z-plane is a {{geometric}} {{representation of the}} complex numbers established by the real axis and the perpendicular <b>imaginary</b> <b>axis.</b> It {{can be thought of}} as a modified Cartesian plane, with the real part of a complex number represented by a displacement along the x-axis, and the imaginary part by a displacement along the y-axis.|$|E
25|$|In the diagram, P is {{the active}} power, Q is the {{reactive}} power (in this case positive), S is the complex {{power and the}} length of S is the apparent power. Reactive power does not do any work, so it is represented as the <b>imaginary</b> <b>axis</b> of the vector diagram. Active power does do work, so it is the real axis.|$|E
25|$|The {{exponential}} function maps any {{line in the}} complex plane to a logarithmic spiral in the complex plane with the center at the origin. Two special cases might be noted: when the original line {{is parallel to the}} real axis, the resulting spiral never closes in on itself; when the original line is parallel to the <b>imaginary</b> <b>axis,</b> the resulting spiral is a circle of some radius.|$|E

50|$|Notice this {{potential}} has an effectively cylindrical symmetry (although {{it also has}} angular velocity dependence), since the only spatial dependence is on the radial length from an <b>imaginary</b> cylinder <b>axis.</b>|$|R
25|$|Beginning with {{a central}} rectangle, taken {{as an example of}} {{elementary}} form, Gleizes points out two mechanical ways of juxtaposing form to create a painting: (1) either by reproducing the initial form (employing various symmetries such as reflectional, rotational or translational), or by modifying (or not) its dimensions. (2) By displacement of the initial form; pivoting around an <b>imaginary</b> <b>axis</b> in one direction or another.|$|E
25|$|The bifurcations of a {{hyperbolic}} {{fixed point}} x0 {{of a system}} family Fμ can be characterized by the eigenvalues of the first derivative of the system DF'μ(x0) computed at the bifurcation point. For a map, the bifurcation will occur when there are eigenvalues of DFμ on the unit circle. For a flow, it will occur when there are eigenvalues on the <b>imaginary</b> <b>axis.</b> For more information, see the main article on Bifurcation theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{second of}} these is valid in the cut complex plane. There are two cuts, from i to the point at infinity, going down the <b>imaginary</b> <b>axis,</b> and from i to the point at infinity, going up the same axis. It works best for real numbers running from −1 to 1. The partial denominators are the odd natural numbers, and the partial numerators (after the first) are just (nz)2, with each perfect square {{appearing}} once. The first was developed by Leonhard Euler; the second by Carl Friedrich Gauss utilizing the Gaussian hypergeometric series.|$|E

25|$|As can be seen, the semi-implicit method can {{simulate}} correctly both stable {{systems that}} have their roots in the left half plane and unstable {{systems that have}} their roots in the right half plane. This is clear advantage over forward (standard) Euler and backward Euler. Forward Euler tends to have less damping than the real system when the negative real parts of the roots get near the <b>imaginary</b> <b>axis</b> and backward Euler may show the system be stable even when the roots are in the right half plane.|$|E
500|$|In real analysis, {{this example}} {{shows that there}} are {{infinitely}} differentiable functions [...] whose Taylor series are not equal to [...] even if they converge. By contrast, the holomorphic functions studied in complex analysis always possess a convergent Taylor series, and even the Taylor [...] series of meromorphic functions, which might have singularities, never converge to a value different from the function itself. The complex function , however, does not approach 0 when [...] approaches 0 along the <b>imaginary</b> <b>axis,</b> {{so it is not}} continuous in the complex plane and its Taylor series is undefined at 0.|$|E

40|$|Arguments are {{presented}} {{indicating that the}} large‐size limiting behavior of the ion‐pair size distribution is qualitatively the same both with, and without, Coulomb interactions between ions. This in turn implies that the static dielectric response function ε 0 [*]/[*]ε(k) derived in the preceding paper is nonanalytic at k[*]=[*] 0. The specific singular behavior of this response requires a branch cut along the <b>imaginary</b> k <b>axis.</b> It furthermore induces an r− 8 tail in the ion atmosphere charge distribution at finite electrolyte concentration...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{singular}} behavior pointed out by Griffiths for H= 0 in dilute magnets is investigated. It is argued that for concentration p less than that for formation of an infinite cluster, all derivatives of M(H) are finite. The nonanalyticity in M(H) {{is due to a}} branch cut along the <b>imaginary</b> H <b>axis</b> having weight exp[−(const) /|H|] for |H|→ 0, and is thus too weak to be experimentally observable.

40|$|A nonrelativistic Bose gas is {{represented}} as a grand-canonical ensemble of fluctuating closed spacetime strings of arbitrary shape and length.

A comparison with Feynman’s description in terms of rings of cyclicly permuted bosons shows that the winding number of a loop corresponds to the number of particles contained in a ring...|$|R

40|$|We {{present results}} for the zero and finite {{temperature}} Drude weight D(T) and for the Meissner fraction of the attractive and the repulsive Hubbard model, {{as well as for}} the model with next nearest neighbor repulsion. They are based on Quantum Monte Carlo studies and on the Bethe ansatz. We show that the Drude weight is well defined as an extrapolation on the <b>imaginary</b> frequency <b>axis,</b> even for finite temperature.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the vacuum {{energy of a}} spinor field {{in the background of}} a Nielsen-Olesen vortex. We use the method of representing the vacuum energy in terms of the Jost function on the <b>imaginary</b> momentum <b>axis.</b> Renormalization is carried out using the heat kernel expansion and zeta functional regularization. With this method well convergent sums and integrals emerge which allow for an efficient numerical calculation of the vacuum energy in the given case where the background is not known analytically but only numerically. The vacuum energy is calculated for several choices of the parameters and it turns out to give small corrections to the classical energy. ...|$|R
40|$|We review recent {{developments}} in electronic structure calculations that go beyond state-of-the-art methods such as density functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). Specifically, we discuss the following methods: GW as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) with the self energy on the <b>imaginary</b> frequency <b>axis,</b> GW+DMFT, and ab initio dynamical vertex approximation (DΓA). The latter includes the physics of GW, DMFT and non-local correlations beyond, and allows for calculating (quantum) critical exponents.

40|$|We {{show how}} the linearized {{equations}} of motion of any dissipative current {{are determined by the}} analytical structure of the associated retarded Green's function. If the singularity of the Green's function, which is nearest to the origin in the complex-frequency plane, is a simple pole on the <b>imaginary</b> frequency <b>axis,</b> the linearized equations of motion can be reduced to relaxation-type equations for the dissipative currents. The value of the relaxation time is given by the inverse of this pole.

40|$|For any {{classical}} statistical-mechanics {{model with}} a discrete state space, and endowed with a dynamics satisfying detailed balance, {{it is possible to}} generalize the Rokhsar-Kivelson point for the quantum dimer model. That is, a quantum Hamiltonian can be constructed (on the same state space), such that the ground state wavefunction coincides with the classical equilibrium distribution. Furthermore the excited eigenstates correspond to classical relaxation modes, which (in cases with a symmetry or conserved quantity) permits extraction of the dispersion law of long-wavelength excitations. The mapping is natural mainly when the states have equal weight, as is typical of a highly frustrated model.
