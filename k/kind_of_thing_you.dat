500|$|Pat Toomay, the Buffalo Bills’ {{defensive}} line MVP and former Dallas Cowboy, who he believed {{was placed on}} the expansion list as a form of blackballing due to the publication of his novel The Crunch, noting in a 2014 Sports Illustrated article that the novel [...] "was the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> write AFTER you retire, not while you're still playing".|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} 2014 CGI special's release, a comic which was {{published}} by IDW Publishing was withdrawn after retailers complained {{that they wanted to}} boycott the issue. The comic, which shows the Powerpuff Girls with breasts and dressed in latex, was designed by an artist who works for Cartoon Network. The artist was [...] "thinking of it more along the lines of 'female empowerment' than the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> guys are talking about". Cartoon Network said in a statement: [...] "We recognise some fans' reaction to the cover and, as such, will no longer be releasing it at comic book shops." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} video was mostly positive. Adam Fairholm from the Internet Music Video Database praised Shakira's dance moves and {{flexibility in the}} video and complimented Nava's direction. James Montgomery from MTV also commended Shakira's dancing, noting that she [...] "even manages to out-Beyoncé". He also complimented Shakira's body, commenting that her posterior is the [...] "breakout star of the video". Anna Pickard from The Guardian appreciated the originality of the video and noted that [...] "the moves contained in this video are not the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> see every day". Andrew Bast from The Daily Beast, however, gave the video a negative review and criticized it for being overly sexual.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said Mrs. Perkenpine, seating herself {{promptly}} {{upon the}} ground; [...] "if you're goin' to talk, I'll stay. I'd {{like to know}} what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> do talk about when you talk." ...|$|R

We will discuss our first year with our 3 D printer, what <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> might expect from the technology, its limitations, and the {{challenges}} we have run into. We will also talk about 3 D printing resources, design software, and 3 D printer programming at our library...|$|R

"I {{love the}} fact that on one side, with acting, you can be a child—acting is {{wonderful}} for its innocence and the fun[...] [...] On the other side, producing is fun for all the adult <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> do. You deal in business, you deal with the creative forces. As an adult who continues to get older, you like the adult risks. It's flying without a net, taking chances and learning. I was never good in economics or business—had no business background, you know, and I like it.|$|R
500|$|Immediately after (Turn On) The Music Machine was released, {{the band}} left for another U.S. tour, despite pleas {{by the group}} to arrange an {{appearance}} at the Monterey Pop Festival. In the small off-periods in their hard-pressed schedule, the Music Machine demoed a new batch of Bonniwell originals at RCA Studios in New York City and Cosimo Matassa's facility in New Orleans, before polishing the tunes back in Los Angeles. From the sessions emerged the group's third single [...] "Double Yellow Line", which was released in April 1967, and bubbled under the Billboard Hot 100 at number 111. The subsequent release, [...] "Eagle Never Hunts the Fly" [...] failed to chart, but {{is often described as}} Bonniwell's tour de force—a tune Ross praised as [...] "sonically compelling works and a lot to listen to, for the time. It was the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> just didn’t hear, you almost worried about getting those sounds onto a 45".|$|E
2500|$|Nixon's {{so-called}} [...] "southern strategy" [...] {{of reducing}} the pressure for school desegregation and otherwise restricting federal {{efforts on behalf of}} blacks had a powerful attraction to northern blue-collar workers as well as southerners. McGovern called the Watergate burglaries [...] "the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> expect under a person like Hitler." ...|$|E

60|$|You {{must learn}} the {{differences}} between <b>things,</b> before <b>you</b> can find out how those differences came about. You must learn Madam How's alphabet before you can read her book. And Madam How's alphabet of animals and plants is, Species, <b>Kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> <b>You</b> must see which are like, and which unlike; what they are like in, {{and what they are}} unlike in. You are beginning to do that with your collection of butterflies. You like to arrange them, and those that are most like nearest to each other, and to compare them. You must do that with thousands <b>of</b> different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> before <b>you</b> can read one page of Madam How's Natural History Book rightly.|$|R
5000|$|Her [...] "official" [...] boss In-hwa (Kim Yoo-ri) is the president's younger sister, at 29 {{only two}} years older than Se-kyung, who became the {{youngest}} person to be appointed to her position. [...] "What sucks is your taste, not your resume," [...] In-hwa bluntly tells Se-kyung. [...] "Taste is an accumulation of what you see and think, as well as the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> are exposed to, from the moment that you were born." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "They {{think very}} highly of her! They'd be--idiots if they didn't," [...] he said. [...] "Of course, I don't know if that's quite the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> {{appreciate}} from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{saw him in}} my life," [...] {{answered}} the Major, [...] "but I shouldn't wonder if he was. Old gentlemen generally are cross. Gout, and that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>you</b> know." ...|$|E

40|$|Drawn from {{a broader}} study into the {{experiences}} of newspaper printers {{within the context of}} ongoing technological innovation in their industry, this paper takes stock {{of the ways in which}} a group of 20 newspaper printers negotiate questions about what they “do for a living”. The findings revealed that whilst most participants would prefer not to talk about themselves at all, addressing this question was a common source of frustration. So much so that some had established specific techniques for avoiding such conversations or ‘short-hands’ that would enable them to extricate themselves from the interactions before awkward technical discussions were raised. Along with identifying the industries they worked in, references to children, their marital status and the recreational and sporting activities that they were involved in were key features <b>of</b> “the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> might talk about/the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that <b>you</b> would tell someone you had just met”...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do not {{remember}} that she did so,' returned Aunt Jane. 'I wish she had waited for me. I have seen more <b>of</b> the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> than <b>you</b> have, Ada.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} what it is, Mr. Davies," [...] said Geoffrey shaking his arm free, [...] "I am not going to stand this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>You</b> must be off your head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is so {{like the}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> {{used to say}} to me when we were boy and girl. I used to enrage you very much, I fear," [...] he said, half gleefully.|$|E
6000|$|Gordon {{shook his}} head reproachfully. [...] "Sit down a minute or two, and I'll heave that {{log on to the}} sling," [...] he said. [...] "This is not the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> ought to be doing." ...|$|E

5000|$|With most <b>of</b> these <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> <b>you</b> {{find that}} the anticipation, or the concept, {{is better than the}} thing itself. But seeing this film was really awe-inspiring, in that you are rarely in the {{presence}} of a perfect object. This was a perfect object. This movie is so drastically wrong, its pathos and its comedy are so wildly misplaced, that you could not, in your fantasy of what it might be like, improve on what it really is.

6000|$|... "Profitable?" [...] said my friend. [...] "I said agreeable. I don't {{know about}} the profit. But {{it was very good}} variety, and it was very cheap.

6000|$|The {{newcomer}} bowed {{with an easy}} indifference, for which, {{not knowing}} exactly why, I disliked him, as he said, [...] "Don't remember that pleasure--meet so many people! Canada must be a very nice place; been thinking of going out there myself--drive oxen, grow potatoes, and that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>you</b> know." ...|$|E
30|$|Sure. If you {{understand}} it, then that’s when {{you understand}} that you can almost always see ways {{in which you can}} intervene. In most evolutionary processes, there are two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> can “improve” on. One is to improve the efficiency of the selection. The other is to improve the variety of the novelty in the process. If you look at organizational evolution of rules and so on, the efficiency is really how you improve learning, and as I mentioned earlier, one <b>of</b> the <b>things</b> that is usually possible with learning is to increase the persistence with failure.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all {{you know}} about it," [...] said Mr Whittlestaff. [...] "Now the fact is, I won't stand this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> If <b>you</b> mean to remain here, you must be less free with your tongue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me. It comes {{so often}} to us {{here that we}} get tired of it. I do, at least. I'm not always up to this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> Champagne--if <b>you</b> please. Miss Mackenzie, you will take some champagne?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Except well, indeed!' {{said the}} Old Soldier. 'He has had dreadful strokes of the sun, no doubt, and jungle fevers and agues, and every <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> can mention.

6000|$|... "Ah, {{there you}} are behind Celia, my dear. Celia, now, plays very prettily, and is always ready to play. However, since Casaubon does not like it, you are all right. But it's a pity you should not have little recreations of that sort, Casaubon: the bow always strung--that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>you</b> know--will not do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; nobody says so. But {{people seem}} to think so. When he is by I hardly speak to her. She is thoughtless and giddy as women are, and takes my arm, and that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>you</b> know. It makes him mad with rage, but upon my honour I don't think she means any harm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bigger--Bigger!" [...] said Aglootook, with a lost {{look in his}} eyes. [...] "You could stuff twenty igloes into it; {{and there}} were three great poles rising out of it as thick as--as me, with other poles across them, low down and high up, and walrus-lines hanging about in all directions, some as thick as my wrist, others as thin as my finger, and strange igloes inside of it--not of snow, but <b>of</b> wood--with all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> could think <b>of</b> in there; and things that--that--you {{could not think of}} even if you were to try--that nobody ever thought of since the world began--wonderful!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not? If he is a {{minister}} {{he must have}} thought about all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> Do <b>you</b> suppose he ever knew of a girl before who had been through what I have? Yes, I {{would like to know}} what he would really say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well; {{just the}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that <b>you</b> never say.

But papa is in a hurry, and I shouldn't {{wonder if the}} train didn't go on in {{a quarter of an}} hour. I'll write to you about Mahomet M. M.; and if I behave very badly, such as prodding him with the dagger, or something of that sort, then I will let you know the details. You can't do it here, so you may as well go." [...] So saying, she jumped into the carriage, and the train had started before Frank Jones had begun to think whether he could do it there or no.|$|R
