2500|$|CMA-ES {{stands for}} Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy. Evolution {{strategies}} (ES) are stochastic, derivative-free methods for numerical optimization [...] of non-linear or non-convex continuous optimization problems. They {{belong to the}} class of evolutionary algorithms and evolutionary computation. [...] An <b>evolutionary</b> <b>algorithm</b> is broadly {{based on the principle}} of biological evolution, namely the repeated interplay of variation (via recombination and mutation) and selection: in each generation (iteration) new individuals (candidate solutions, denoted as [...] ) are generated by variation, usually in a stochastic way, of the current parental individuals. Then, some individuals are selected to become the parents in the next generation based on their fitness or objective function value [...] Like this, over the generation sequence, individuals with better and better -values are generated.|$|E
2500|$|Evolutionary {{algorithms}} {{are popular}} approaches to generating Pareto optimal solutions to a multi-objective optimization problem. Currently, most evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms apply Pareto-based ranking schemes. Evolutionary algorithms {{such as the}} Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) [...] and Strength Pareto <b>Evolutionary</b> <b>Algorithm</b> 2 (SPEA-2) have become standard approaches, although some schemes based on particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing are significant. The main advantage of evolutionary algorithms, when applied to solve multi-objective optimization problems, {{is the fact that}} they typically generate sets of solutions, allowing computation of an approximation of the entire Pareto front. The main disadvantage of evolutionary algorithms is their lower speed and the Pareto optimality of the solutions cannot be guaranteed. It is only known that none of the generated solutions dominates the others.|$|E
