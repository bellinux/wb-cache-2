5|$|Lane was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} of preparedness in the prelude to U.S. involvement in World War I. In early 1917, <b>he</b> <b>urged</b> Wilson to authorize the arming and convoying of merchant vessels. Wilson refused, but changed his mind when informed of the Zimmermann Telegram. In a critical Cabinet meeting in March 1917, Lane, with other Cabinet members, urged American intervention in the war.|$|E

5|$|While Stratton was at Johns Hopkins, the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 struck {{destroying}} large {{swaths of}} the city.

5|$|After US President Richard Nixon {{made his}} famous 1972 visit to China, {{a wave of}} exchanges took place between the two countries. One of these was a {{delegation}} of the American Institute of Architects in 1974, which Pei joined. It was his first trip back to China since leaving in 1935. He was favorably received, returned the welcome with positive comments, {{and a series of}} lectures ensued. Pei noted in one lecture that since the 1950s Chinese architects had been content to imitate Western styles; <b>he</b> <b>urged</b> his audience in one lecture to search China's native traditions for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|Although Minton {{was on the}} Supreme Court, he {{remained}} casually involved in Democratic internal politics. He wrote Truman several letters criticizing Justices Robert H. Jackson and Hugo Black, referring to Black as a demagogue. He also offered advice on dealing with Republican opposition in the Senate. In a 1954 letter, after Truman left office, <b>he</b> <b>urged</b> Truman to help focus public attention {{on the economy and}} away from communism, a threat he claimed the Republicans were exaggerating to avoid confronting their own problems.|$|E
5|$|As President, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Congress and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened {{to divide the}} Union. Debate over the status of slavery in the Mexican Cession dominated the political agenda and led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push {{for the expansion of}} slavery, and he sought sectional harmony above all other concerns. To avoid the issue of slavery, <b>he</b> <b>urged</b> settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, setting the stage for the Compromise of 1850.|$|E

5|$|As {{a teacher}} <b>he</b> <b>urged</b> his {{students}} to read extensively and be original in their work.

5|$|Blamey was {{involved}} in discussions with the government over {{the size of the}} Army to be maintained. Now that the danger of invasion of Australia had passed, the government reconsidered how the nation's resources, particularly of manpower, should be distributed. Blamey pressed for a commitment to maintain three AIF divisions, as only they could legally be sent north of the equator where the final campaigns would be fought. <b>He</b> <b>urged</b> that the Empire Air Training Scheme be curtailed, and opposed MacArthur's proposal to use the Australian Army primarily for logistic support and leave combat roles principally to American troops.|$|E
5|$|By {{the terms}} of his parole, Mallory was not {{permitted}} to hold public office, so he made a living by reopening his old law practice.

5|$|Cheney {{publicly}} {{expressed concern}} that nations such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, could acquire nuclear components {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union in 1991. The end of the Cold War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; <b>he</b> <b>urged</b> the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Development of the {{military}} settlement at Tvrđa started in 1687 when the Habsburg armies drove the Ottomans {{out of the city}} during the Great Turkish War. The chief commander of the Imperial army, Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden, saw Osijek as a location of exceptional strategic importance in the war against the Ottomans. <b>He</b> <b>urged</b> the repair of the city walls, and proposed construction of a new fort according to Vauban's principles of military engineering.|$|E
5|$|Ernuszt {{was one of}} Matthias Corvinus' closest advisors. <b>He</b> <b>urged</b> the Holy See {{to grant}} the Zebegény Abbey in Baranya County to him in 1483.

In the same year, Ernuszt (who spoke German) was made the captain-general or the deputy of the captain-general of Archduchy of Austria, which had recently been occupied by the king. Ernuszt loaned 1000 gold florins to Matthias's queen, Beatrice of Naples.|$|E

5|$|Gerard was {{a patron}} of learning, {{to the extent}} that <b>he</b> <b>urged</b> at least one of his clergy to study Hebrew, a {{language}} not commonly studied at that time. He himself was a student of astrology, which led to suggestions that he was a magician and a sorcerer. Partly because of such rumours, and his unpopular attempts to reform his cathedral clergy, Gerard was denied a burial inside York Minster after his sudden death in 1108. His successor as archbishop subsequently had Gerard's remains moved into the cathedral church from their initial resting place beside the cathedral porch.|$|E
5|$|Harding, as a {{politician}} respected by both Republicans and Progressives, was asked to be temporary chairman of the 1916 Republican National Convention and to deliver the keynote address. <b>He</b> <b>urged</b> delegates to stand as a united party. The convention nominated Justice Charles Evans Hughes. Harding reached out to Roosevelt once the former president declined the 1916 Progressive nomination, a refusal that effectively scuttled that party. In the November 1916 presidential election, despite increasing Republican unity, Hughes was narrowly defeated by Wilson.|$|E
5|$|In late May 1988, amid rising {{nationalist}} tensions from glasnost and perestroika, Armenia's new Communist {{party leader}} allowed the banned tricolour of the DRA {{to fly in}} Yerevan {{for the first time}} in over sixty years. A year later, following a Nagorno-Karabakh-themed mass demonstration where the tricolour was flown, <b>he</b> <b>urged</b> its official recognition. This came on August 24, 1990, a day after the Armenian Supreme Soviet declared the republic's sovereignty and renamed the country the Republic of Armenia. At that point, just over a year before Armenia declared its formal independence from the USSR, the tricolour replaced the 1952 flag.|$|E
50|$|General Hague {{reveals his}} {{opposition}} to President Clark and has begun a coup by escaping aboard his ship, the EAS Alexander, along with several Earth starships. <b>He</b> <b>urges</b> more starships to defect in order to gather enough forces to depose Clark.|$|R
