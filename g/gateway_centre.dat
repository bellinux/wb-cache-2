50|$|Central Bedfordshire Council and the National Trust {{commissioned}} Architype architects {{to build}} a visitor centre known as the Chilterns <b>Gateway</b> <b>Centre,</b> on {{the very top of}} Dunstable Downs. The summit is right next to the B4541 road that crosses the hill, and so an ascent of the hill requires nothing more than getting out of a car at the highest point and walking across to the trig point.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the closure}} of the Racecourse, the land was {{retained}} by the council for public recreation and partially converted into football pitches. The area is still known as the Racecourse Playing Fields. The County Cricket Ground also remained on the site, and in 1955 the cricket field was moved eastwards and closer to the grandstand. The stand itself - along with its public house, the Grandstand Hotel - continued in use up until 1998, but became extremely dilapidated in later years and was demolished in 2001. Its site is now occupied by the ground's <b>Gateway</b> <b>Centre.</b> Other racing-related structures, such as the old stables and judges' box, were adapted for use by the cricket club, but have also been lost to 21st century redevelopment. The last remaining racecourse feature, the jockeys' quarters, was demolished in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Other {{sites have}} {{provided}} evidence that ringforts {{may not have}} principally been farmsteads, but rather had a more diverse and {{significant role in the}} economy. A good example of this is provided by the large, tri-vallate ringfort in Garannes, County Cork, which offers no evidence for habitation or settlement but provides a great deal of evidence to suggest that the site had an industrial nature. Furthermore, the finds of continental pottery at the site, suggests that the site was trading with the continent and/or may have been acting as a <b>gateway</b> <b>centre</b> for similar high status goods into the local economy. Both Garannes, and especially Garryduff II, highlight the other roles that ringforts may have had in early Christian Ireland. While it would seem that most ringforts fitted the traditional explanation as farmsteads, that should not be used as a blanket explanation. A number of other functions for many of the surviving ringforts, such as those outlined above and possibly other settlement functions, still need to be considered.|$|E

50|$|The Monumental Arch {{was unusual}} from an {{architectural}} viewpoint, {{since it had}} a double façade, masking a 30° bend between the eastern and central sections of the Great Colonnade.

50|$|Whilst Wollongong Central {{today is}} one {{complete}} shopping centre, {{it was originally}} two separate and distinct shopping centres. Crown Central shopping centre was constructed and opened in 1975 by the Abbey Capital Property Group on the northern side of Crown Street, taking {{the majority of the}} Crown Street frontage between Keira Street and Church Street. In 1986, a joint venture between Wollongong City Council and Kern Corporation developed the Crown <b>Gateway</b> shopping <b>centre</b> {{on the site of the}} former Coles Building on the southern side of Crown Street, extending through to Burelli Street.|$|R
50|$|Another {{overlooked}} {{aspect of}} mobile latency is the inter-network handoff; as a customer on Network A calls a Network B customer the call must traverse two separate Radio Access Networks, two core networks and an interlinking <b>Gateway</b> Mobile Switching <b>Centre</b> (GMSC) which performs the physical interconnecting {{between the two}} providers.|$|R
60|$|The court {{yard was}} a very {{pleasant}} place. It was surrounded on three sides by the buildings of the chateau, which were quite imposing in their character, like a palace.

In 1998 the 6000 seat Wollongong Entertainment Centre was opened.|$|R
50|$|The {{trees are}} {{important}} because of their aesthetic significance. Lining a major arterial road, these large and mature fig trees are significant as defining one of the <b>gateways</b> to the <b>centre</b> of Brisbane. Despite recent major road construction, the fig trees still dominate the streetscape in their respective locations, providing welcome shade with a distinctly subtropical atmosphere.|$|R
5000|$|The Place Dauphine, {{laid out}} in 1609 while the Place des Vosges was still under {{construction}} and named for the Dauphin of France, the future Louis XIII, was among the earliest city-planning projects of Henry IV. The space, essentially a triangle because of its promontory location, was made over to [...] for development. Twelve lots were sold, and forty-five irregularly sized houses were constructed behind a standardised façade. The houses were built of brick with limestone quoins supported on arcaded stone ground floors and capped by steep slate roofs with dormers, very like the contemporaneous façades of Place des Vosges. There were originally two entrances to the Place Dauphine, one at the [...] "downstream" [...] point, through a kind of <b>gateway</b> <b>centred</b> on paired pavilions facing the equestrian statue of Henry IV {{on the far side}} of the Pont Neuf, and the second in the centre of the eastern range. Badly damaged during the turmoil of the Paris Commune of 1871, the eastern range was swept away in 1872 to open the view to the monumental white marble Second Empire Palais de Justice (built 1857-68), like a glazed colonnade centred on the Place Dauphine, the remains of which now form a kind of forecourt to it. Few visitors penetrate the Place Dauphine, which lies behind them, and where all the other buildings have been raised in height, given new façades, rebuilt or replaced with heightened pastiches of the originals.|$|R
