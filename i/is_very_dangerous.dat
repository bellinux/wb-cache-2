5|$|Finn {{manages to}} steal the crown, hoping to sell it instead of Bartram. In town, however, the Destiny Gang steal the crown as well as Bartram. Finn, furious, riles up the town, who begin to riot, as they are sick of being abused by the Destiny Gang. Finn goes to the Destiny Gang's mansion to confront their leader, Big Destiny. Once there, Big Destiny returns the crown, noting {{that it is the}} last {{possession}} that he will ever own. Finn looks out the window and sees that the gang is burning the city. Finn races to his home, taking Marceline with him. When he arrives at his house, the gang has already set it on fire with his parents and infant sibling trapped upstairs. Finn asks Marceline if the crown is magic and she tells him it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous</b> magic. He then puts the crown on his head, and the power begins to flow through him.|$|E
5|$|If the German {{air force}} had prevailed and {{attempted}} a landing, a much-reduced Royal Air Force {{would have been}} obliged to operate from airfields {{well away from the}} southeast of England. Any airfield that was in danger of being captured would have been made inoperable and there were plans to remove all portable equipment from vulnerable radar bases and completely destroy anything that could not be moved. Whatever was left of the RAF would have been committed to intercepting the invasion fleet in concert with the Royal Navy—to fly in the presence of an enemy that enjoys air superiority <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous.</b> However, the RAF would have kept several advantages, such as being able to operate largely over friendly territory, as well as having the ability to fly for longer as, until the Germans were able to operate from airfields in England, Luftwaffe pilots would still have to fly significant distances to reach their operational area.|$|E

25|$|Brazilian {{census data}} (PNAD, 1999) {{indicate}} that 2.55 million 10-14 year-olds were illegally holding jobs. They {{were joined by}} 3.7 million 15-17 year-olds and about 375,000 5-9 year-olds. Due to the raised age restriction of 14, {{at least half of}} the recorded young workers had been employed illegally which lead to many not being protect by important labour laws. Although substantial time has passed since the time of regulated child labour, there is still a large number of children working illegally in Brazil. Many children are used by drug cartels to sell and carry drugs, guns, and other illegal substances because of their perception of innocence. This type of work that youth are taking part in <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous</b> due to the physical and psychological implications that come with these jobs. Yet despite the hazards that come with working with drug dealers, there has been an increase in this area of employment throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous</b> for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E

He said [...] "those Hezbollah fighters who are killing children and terrorizing people and destroying houses in Syria will go to hell". The Consultative Gathering, a group of Shia and Sunni leaders in Baalbek-Hermel, also called on Hezbollah not to [...] "interfere" [...] in Syria. They said, [...] "Opening a front against the Syrian people and dragging Lebanon to war with the Syrian people <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous</b> and will {{have a negative impact on}} the relations between the two". Walid Jumblatt, leader of the Progressive Socialist Party, also called on Hezbollah to end its involvement and claimed that [...] "Hezbollah is fighting inside Syria with orders from Iran".

2500|$|Locus of control's {{best known}} {{application}} {{may have been}} in the area of health psychology, largely due to the work of Kenneth Wallston. Scales to measure locus of control in the health domain were reviewed by Furnham and Steele [...] in 1993. The best-known are the Health Locus of Control Scale and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, or MHLC. The latter scale is based on the idea (echoing Levenson's earlier work) that health may be attributed to three sources: internal factors (such as self-determination of a healthy lifestyle), powerful others (such as one's doctor) or luck (which <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous</b> as lifestyle advice will be ignored – these people are very difficult to help).|$|E
2500|$|Melanie's Marvelous Measles is a self-published children's {{book written}} in 2012. The book argues that {{contracting}} measles is beneficial to health, and that vaccines are ineffective. The book came to attention in 2015 after the Disneyland measles outbreak began during December {{of the previous}} year. Many commentators have criticized the book because of the dangers associated with contracting measles, and because its title is reminiscent of George's Marvellous Medicine, by Roald Dahl, whose daughter, Olivia Dahl, died from measles. The book has also received attention for the numerous negative reviews it has received on Amazon.com.

2500|$|The PIT {{maneuver}} {{was adapted}} from the bump and run technique used in stock car racing, where drivers would bump a competitor to take them out, giving rise to the term, [...] "takeout". [...] This maneuver is illegal in stock car racing because it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous.</b> [...] The high speed involved in auto racing makes it much easier for drivers to take out another car with a less substantial bump than at lower speeds. [...] When employing the PIT maneuver, {{the speed of the}} two cars involved will determine how far the car will travel once it is bumped. [...] Partially for this reason, the higher the speed, the more unpredictable and dangerous the PIT maneuver becomes. [...] This {{is just one of the}} very important factors a police officer must consider before implementing the PIT maneuver. A police officer is trained to wait until conditions are right before attempting a PIT maneuver to avoid the use of deadly force. [...] Speeds must be lower and the [...] "landing site" [...] for the bumped vehicle must be clear of danger.|$|E
