25|$|In {{the domain}} of digital signal processing, the term {{interpolation}} refers {{to the process of}} converting a sampled digital signal (such as a sampled audio signal) to that of a higher sampling rate (Upsampling) using various digital filtering techniques (e.g., convolution with a frequency-limited impulse signal). In this application there is a specific requirement that the <b>harmonic</b> <b>content</b> of the original signal be preserved without creating aliased <b>harmonic</b> <b>content</b> of the original signal above the original Nyquist limit of the signal (i.e., above fs/2 of the original signal sample rate). An early and fairly elementary discussion on this subject can be found in Rabiner and Crochiere's book Multirate Digital Signal Processing.|$|E
25|$|This {{method of}} calculating the average power gives the active power {{regardless}} of <b>harmonic</b> <b>content</b> of the waveform. In practical applications, {{this would be}} done in the digital domain, where the calculation becomes trivial when compared to the use of rms and phase to determine active power.|$|E
25|$|Older {{designs of}} ferroresonant {{transformers}} had an output with high <b>harmonic</b> <b>content,</b> {{leading to a}} distorted output waveform. Modern devices are used to construct a perfect sine wave. The ferroresonant action is a flux limiter rather than a voltage regulator, but with a fixed supply frequency it can maintain an almost constant average output voltage even as the input voltage varies widely.|$|E

25|$|Pachelbel's {{large-scale}} vocal {{works are}} mostly written in modern style influenced by Italian Catholic music, {{with only a}} few non-concerted pieces and old plainchant cantus firmus techniques employed very infrequently. The string ensemble is typical for the time, three viols and two violins. The former are either used to provide <b>harmonic</b> <b>content</b> in instrumental sections or to double the vocal lines in tutti sections; the violins either engage in contrapuntal textures of varying density or are employed for ornamentation. Distinct features of Pachelbel's vocal writing in these pieces, {{aside from the fact that}} it is almost always very strongly tonal, include frequent use of permutation fugues and writing for paired voices. The Magnificat settings, most composed during Pachelbel's late Nuremberg years, are influenced by the Italian-Viennese style and distinguish themselves from their antecedents by treating the canticle in a variety of ways and stepping away from text-dependent composition.|$|E
25|$|Timbre is {{perceived}} as the quality of different sounds (e.g. the thud of a fallen rock, the whir of a drill, the tone of a musical instrument or {{the quality of a}} voice) and represents the pre-conscious allocation of a sonic identity to a sound (e.g. “it’s an oboe!"). This identity is based on information gained from frequency transients, noisiness, unsteadiness, perceived pitch and the spread and intensity of overtones in the sound over an extended time frame. The way a sound changes over time (see figure 4) provides most of the information for timbre identification. Even though a small section of the wave form from each instrument looks very similar (see the expanded sections indicated by the orange arrows in figure 4), differences in changes over time between the clarinet and the piano are evident in both loudness and <b>harmonic</b> <b>content.</b> Less noticeable are the different noises heard, such as air hisses for the clarinet and hammer strikes for the piano.|$|E

Musicologist Walter Everett comments on the aptness of the conciliatory lyric [...] "Maybe you'd understand", which closes the second of these sections, as the melody concludes on a perfect authentic cadence, representing in musical terms [...] "a natural emblem for any coming together".|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- A {{method for}} {{analyzing}} the harmonics and controlling the output voltage for a parallel loaded resonant inverter controlled using {{pulse width modulation}} (PWM) technique is presented. Comparison between constant frequency PWM controlled resonant inverter with and without LC filter is made. A conventional PI controller is incorporated so that the system output voltage can be maintained at the desired level. The results obtained show that the lower order <b>harmonic</b> <b>contents</b> and hence the overall <b>harmonic</b> <b>contents</b> are reduced significantly due {{to the introduction of}} LC filter, which yields a cleaner output. Key-Words:- resonant converter, pulse width modulation, harmonic analysis. ...|$|R
500|$|Nielsen studied Renaissance {{polyphony}} closely, {{which accounts}} {{for some of the}} melodic and <b>harmonic</b> <b>content</b> of his music. This interest is exemplified in his Tre Motetter (Three Motets, Op. 55). To non-Danish critics, Nielsen's music initially had a neo-classical sound but became increasingly modern as he developed his own approach to what the writer and composer Robert Simpson called progressive tonality, moving from one key to another. Typically, Nielsen's music might end in a different key from that of its commencement, sometimes as the outcome of a struggle as in his symphonies. There is debate as to how much such elements owe to his folk music activities. Some critics have referred to his rhythms, his use of acciacaturas or appoggiaturas, or his frequent use of a flattened seventh and minor third in his works, as being typically Danish. The composer himself wrote [...] "The intervals, as I see it, are the elements which first arouse a deeper interest in music... t is intervals which surprise and delight us anew every time we hear the cuckoo in spring. Its appeal would be less if its call were all on one note." ...|$|E
2500|$|When natural {{sounds are}} {{analyzed}} {{in the frequency}} domain (as on a spectrum analyzer), the spectra of their sounds exhibits amplitude spikes {{at each of the}} fundamental tone's harmonics corresponding to resonant properties of the instruments (spectral peaks that are also referred to as formants). [...] Some harmonics may have higher amplitudes than others. [...] The specific set of harmonic-vs-amplitude pairs is known as a sound's <b>harmonic</b> <b>content.</b> [...] A synthesized sound requires accurate reproduction of the original sound in both the frequency domain and the time domain. [...] A sound does not necessarily have the same <b>harmonic</b> <b>content</b> throughout the duration of the sound.

2500|$|On a {{different}} note, the Kurzweil K150 and the Kawai K5 explored additive synthesis where harmonics can be proportioned to make different tones while enveloping groups of them {{differently in the}} mid '80s. RMI had explored this to a limited extent in 1974 with the harmonic synthesizer they produced. It should also be mentioned that they were producing the earliest electric piano machines in 1970. This less common synthesis method is also used in Kawai's last synthesizer product series, the K5000's from 1996.

2500|$|... "Hollaback Girl" [...] is a hip hop {{song that}} draws {{influence}} from 1980s hip hop and dance music. It is a moderately fast song, with a tempo of 110 beats per minute, {{and it is}} played in the key of D minor. Like the majority of pop music, it is set in common time. The main chord pattern of the song alternates between B major and D minor triads. Most of the <b>harmonic</b> <b>content</b> of the song revolves around a two-chord alternation which music theorists may regard as an L (leading tone) transformation, in which {{the root of the}} major chord is lowered by a half-step to form a second inversion minor chord on the third scale degree, a slight tonicization of B major, but resolving back to D minor by having the same A, a perfect fourth down from D. This stepwise motion between B and A highlights this chord change. It is in verse-chorus form with a bridge before the fourth and final chorus. The song features sparse instrumentation, primarily a minimal beat produced by drum machine. A guitar plays the song's riff, a six-note pattern as Stefani repeats [...] "this my shit" [...] during the chorus, and a brass section joins during the second chorus. In part because of its cheerleading motif, it drew comparisons to Toni Basil's 1982 song [...] "Mickey".|$|E

2500|$|... "Parlour music" [...] {{was popular}} music {{performed}} in the parlours of middle class homes by amateur singers and pianists. Disseminated as sheet music, its heyday came in the 19th century {{as a result of}} a steady increase in the number of households with enough surplus cash to purchase musical instruments and instruction in music and with the leisure time and cultural motivation to engage in recreational music-making. In contrast to the chord-based classical music, parlour music features melodies, which are harmonically independent or not determined by the harmony. Many of the earliest parlour songs were transcriptions for voice and keyboard of other music, such as Thomas Moore's Irish Melodies, which comprised traditional tunes with new lyrics. Other genres performed included arias from Italian operas, patriotic selections, religious songs and pieces written for the musical stage, including excerpts from blackface minstrel shows. As the 19th century wore on, more and more songs were newly composed specifically for use by amateurs at home and these pieces began to develop a style all their own: similar in melodic and <b>harmonic</b> <b>content</b> to art songs of the day, but shorter and simpler in structure and making fewer technical demands on singer and accompanist. The high point of the parlour song came in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in North America and the British Isles. Songs became more complex and sophisticated in their melodic and harmonic vocabulary and, in addition to their continuing use in the parlour, were also often sung in public recitals by professional singers. Characteristic and popular parlour songs include [...] "Home, Sweet Home" [...] by Henry Bishop with lyrics by John Howard Payne, [...] "The Old Arm Chair" [...] by Henry Russell, [...] "The Lost Chord" [...] composed by Arthur Sullivan with lyrics by Adelaide A. Proctor and [...] "Take Back the Heart" [...] by Claribel (Mrs. Charlotte Barnard).|$|E

30|$|The {{controllable}} switch type converter is represented typically by a two-level converter and its topological structure and operating control are relatively simple.
