25|$|The Court of Appeal also {{disagreed}} with the High Court's approach of granting Shadrake an unquantified discount should be given {{in order to prevent}} stifling legitimate debate on the death penalty and other areas of law. The Court of Appeal maintained that such debate had always been open to all and would continue to be so, but such debate must not <b>go</b> <b>overboard</b> and constitute scandalizing contempt. It affirmed the High Court's sentence of six weeks' imprisonment and a fine of $20,000, with an additional jail term of two weeks to run consecutively with the six-week term if the fine was not paid.|$|E
25|$|After this, Captain George Wolfe assumed command, {{having been}} {{appointed}} in April 1801. On 1 July Galatea came into Plymouth after a cruise of 18 {{weeks in the}} Atlantic and off the western islands. Then during October and November {{she was on a}} 28-day cruise in the Bay of Biscay. Here she not only endured fifteen severe gales, but on 1 and 2 November she nearly foundered. Hurricane-force winds sent her mizzen mast and the main and foretop masts over the side, even though she had no sails set. Furthermore, when the mizzen mast went it took one seaman to <b>go</b> <b>overboard</b> with it and severely injured others. When the winds died down on 3 November, Byng sailed Galatea for Cork. There he jury rigged a rigged a mizzen-mast, main, and foretop-mast. Galatea finally reached Plymouth on 22 November.|$|E

[...] However, a station reported winds of 23mph (37km/h) six hours after Lester passed over Socorro Island. Several ships {{came in contact with}} Lester, with one in the eye reporting hurricane-force winds for 11hours on August 22. The ship in the eye reported rough seas, causing it to roll 33° to each side and thus was responsible for a large amount of cargo to <b>go</b> <b>overboard.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Millard House in Pasadena, California {{was used}} to {{represent}} {{the outside of the}} fortress of the Albino, while the interior was filmed on Stage 18 in the Paramount lot. The fight scenes were jointly choreographed by Dan Curry and Dennis Madalone, with the scenes filmed over the course of two days. Direct Winrich Kolbe left the choreography completely in Curry and Madalone's hands, but gave them instructions not to <b>go</b> <b>overboard.</b> Whilst filming the scenes, Kolbe had Richard Wagner's opera Götterdämmerung played on a loop throughout. This operatic theme was taken forward by composer Dennis McCarthy in his score for the episode, who said that he abandoned all subtlety, and told the orchestra to [...] "play the battles as battles".|$|E
500|$|Talpade, who {{previously}} featured {{as the title}} character of Kukunoor's Iqbal (2005), observed the bahuroopiyas in Rajasthan and incorporated their dialect, accent, and their body language for his character. About Kukunoor, he said that, [...] "though one tends to <b>go</b> <b>overboard</b> as an actor most of the times, the way he handles the character as a director, Nagesh makes you {{feel that it is}} very simple for you to delineate the character." [...] Through his character of a bahuroopiya, Talpade was required to perform mimicry. While he was good at mimicry in college, it was during the filming of Iqbal, Kukunoor noted this talent of his and thus Dor came into Talpade's hands. About his co-actors, he said that it was refreshing to work with Panag and Takia despite the scorching heat of [...]|$|E

"With Kershner," [...] Revill said, [...] "you had to {{keep the}} reins tight [...] you couldn't <b>go</b> <b>overboard.</b> It was the perfect example of the old adage 'less is more' [...] the Emperor doesn't say very much. But when he finally appears, it's {{at a point in}} the saga when everyone's waiting to see him. It's the Emperor, the arch villain of all time, and when he says there's a great {{disturbance}} in the Force, I mean, that's enough oomph!" [...] Years later, during production of Revenge of the Sith, Lucas decided to shoot new footage for The Empire Strikes Back to create continuity between the prequels and original trilogy. Thus, in the 2004 DVD release of The Empire Strikes Back Special Edition, the original version of the Emperor was replaced by McDiarmid, and the dialogue between the Emperor and Darth Vader was revised.|$|E

500|$|Visual {{effects were}} {{delivered}} by London's Moving Picture Company (MPC), and {{were applied to}} the 1,000 or so shots in the film, {{though most of the}} effects simply painted out puppet supports and similar set equipment. Some visual effects elements—groups of birds and butterflies, were created completely in CG, though others were composited as visual effects from real-life elements. Pete Kozachik explained that the trick for shooting the characters by themselves was obtaining visually interesting shots that would dependably support the director's storytelling, saying: [...] "The challenge is keeping the action clear and simple with lighting and composition. There's a discipline to clear storytelling with these puppets. You want to be abstract, but one can easily <b>go</b> <b>overboard</b> with these critters because they aren't as familiar to the audience as real humans. The characters don't necessarily translate the same as if you're shooting a real person. You have to consciously balance arty atmosphere and graphic clarity so as to not confuse the audience about what it is they're looking at." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} start of the voyage, the James Caird which, in {{addition}} to Shackleton and Worsley, also carried McNish, sailors John Vincent and Timothy McCarthy, as well as the experienced Tom Crean, encountered the ice but Worsley found a way through and into the open ocean. The crew set up two watches for the journey, which eventually would take 16 days, in strong and heavy seas, to reach South Georgia. [...] For most of the voyage, the weather proved to be stormy and so overcast Worsley was unable to take more than a few sightings with his sextant. [...] He described one sighting as [...] "...cuddling the mast with one arm and swinging fore and aft round the mast, sextant and all..." [...] and he would [...] "...catch the sun when the boat leaped her highest on the crest of a sea...". At times the sea conditions were so rough he was braced by the other crew members when taking his sightings. On occasion, the temperature was bitter and each man would spend one minute shifts chipping away ice that coated the top surfaces of the James Caird, affecting its buoyancy. The heavy seas meant there was considerable risk that a man could <b>go</b> <b>overboard.</b>|$|E

They may be playing Social-Realist icons, but each manages to make something personal and idiosyncratic out of the material, without destroying the ballad-like style.

2500|$|Gordon Parks was {{approached}} {{to direct the}} film, and though he was disillusioned by his experience {{with the release of}} his 1976 feature film Leadbelly, he anticipated a different experience in television. After not having directed a film in years, he returned to adapt the autobiography. The script mostly followed Northup's autobiography, though Parks had to change some parts. Parks said, [...] "Solomon was very tolerant in a terrible situation, and very fair in his reporting. I tried to remain fair in my reporting and not <b>go</b> <b>overboard,</b> although it's very difficult not to when you know so much happened that was so bad to so many people. But there were things I had to change." [...] Five historical advisers assisted with the film, though Parks said he felt pressured [...] "to keep it toned down".|$|E
2500|$|Film critic Gene Siskel, {{writing for}} the Chicago Tribune, said Solomon Northup's Odyssey was [...] "beautifully filmed" [...] with Parks's past {{experience}} as a photographer. Siskel also commended Brooks for portraying Northup [...] "with nobility and humanity". Jeff Jarvis, reviewing for People, said the film was made [...] "with remarkable restraint". Jarvis said, [...] "It is teary stuff. But because Parks and Brooks do not <b>go</b> <b>overboard,</b> they manage to make their picture of slavery seem real. Their show... is extraordinarily effective and moving." [...] Author Alan J. Singer wrote that [...] "Solomon Northup's Odyssey... {{is a much more}} accurate picture of plantation life and work" [...] than the miniseries Roots (1977), which he said had a soap opera quality and that [...] "enslaved Africans are rarely shown working". For the film, Past America, Inc. received the Erik Barnouw Award from the Organization of American Historians.|$|E
