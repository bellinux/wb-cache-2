5|$|On July 25, 1901, a large fire erupted on Davenport's east side. The fire burnt <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> {{late in the}} day, {{instead of}} being brought under control. Eight blocks of {{buildings}} were destroyed causing one million dollars of damage. No lives were lost during the fire.|$|E
5|$|A further fire {{broke out}} during the early morning of 14 December. Firefighters were of the view that {{extinguishing}} it would leave the risk of petroleum vapour re-igniting or exploding, {{so it would be}} better to allow the fire, which was well contained, to burn <b>itself</b> <b>out.</b> Hertfordshire Fire Service's deputy chief Mark Yates stated that escaping petroleum vapour was the most likely cause of the original explosion and fire.|$|E
50|$|Both the Bricklin coin and the Bricklin stamp were {{a greater}} success than the car <b>itself,</b> selling <b>out</b> quickly.|$|R

5|$|According {{to local}} geologists, the exact {{source of the}} spring remains unknown, but it is {{believed}} that its origin may be southwest of its actual location, possibly at Bukit Timah. Hot springs are formed when underground water comes into contact with hot rock masses. The resulting high pressure causes the water to seep upwards through cracks, forcing <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> of the ground as a spring.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 1845, fire {{destroyed}} much of London, {{which was}} at the time largely constructed of wooden buildings. One of the first casualties was the town's only fire engine. This fire burned nearly 30 acres of land destroying 150 buildings before burning <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> later the same day. One-fifth of London was destroyed and this was the province's first million dollar fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{length and}} nature of parental care varies widely amongst {{different}} orders and species. At one extreme, parental care in megapodes ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately. At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the great frigatebird, whose chicks take {{up to six months}} to fledge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months. The chick guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched. The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation.|$|E

25|$|After a {{few more}} hours, the strikers {{attempted}} to burn the barges. They seized a raft, loaded it with oil-soaked timber and floated it toward the barges. The Pinkertons nearly panicked, and a Pinkerton captain had to threaten to shoot anyone who fled. But the fire burned <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> before it reached the barges. The strikers then loaded a railroad flatcar with drums of oil and set it afire. The flatcar hurtled down the rails toward the mill's wharf where the barges were docked. But the car stopped at the water's edge and burned <b>itself</b> <b>out.</b> Dynamite was thrown at the barges, but it only hit the mark once (causing a little damage to one barge). At 2:00p.m., the workers poured oil onto the river, hoping the oil slick would burn the barges; attempts to light the slick failed.|$|E

25|$|The Protestant Ascendancy {{was shocked}} by the events of the 1790s, as was the British government. In {{response}} to them, in 1801 under the Irish Act of Union, which merged the Kingdom of Ireland with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland the Irish Parliament voted <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> of existence and Dublin lost its political status as a capital.|$|E
25|$|As a {{practical}} matter, {{prior to the}} passage of Dodd–Frank, investment advisers were not required to register with the SEC if the investment adviser had fewer than 15 clients during the previous 12 months and did not hold <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> generally to the public as an investment adviser. The act eliminates that exemption, thereby rendering numerous additional investment advisers, hedge funds, and private equity firms subject to new registration requirements.|$|E
25|$|Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and Florida International University (FIU) – A Miami-area rivalry {{that plays}} <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> {{annually}} in football's Shula Bowl and conference basketball games. It was a conference rivalry from 1993 to 1998 in the TAAC (now the ASUN); the two schools were reunited for football in 2005 and other sports in 2006 when FAU joined the Sun Belt. The two schools moved together to C-USA in 2013.|$|E

25|$|Some 700 representatives at {{the conference}} {{ultimately}} adopted a draft constitution on July12 that envisaged a bicameral legislature and {{the dissolution of the}} congress. But because the convention's draft of the constitution would dissolve the congress, there was little likelihood that the congress would vote <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> of existence. The Supreme Soviet immediately rejected the draft and declared that the Congress of People's Deputies was the supreme lawmaking body and hence would decide on the new constitution.|$|E
25|$|Shen, et al. created fusion {{proteins}} between OA1 and GFP. Melanosomal localization of OA1 {{has been}} confirmed by immuno-electron microscopy and other techniques alike. Localization patterns of wild type OA1-GFP and mutated OA1-GFP were compared. The wild type OA1 localized to late endosomal or lysosomal compartments. This is supported by data from Samaraweera, et al. that OA1 colocalizes with Lamp1, which is a marker for late endosomal compartment. Hence, OA1 might traffick <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> of this compartment to the melanosomes.|$|E
25|$|Due to Newfoundland's high debt load, {{arising from}} World War I and {{construction}} of the Newfoundland Railway, and decreasing revenue, due {{to the collapse of}} fish prices, the Newfoundland legislature voted <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> of existence in 1933, in exchange for loan guarantees by the Crown and a promise it would be re-established. On February 16, 1934, the Commission of Government was sworn in, ending 79 years of responsible government. The Commission consisted of seven persons appointed by the British government. For 15 years no elections took place, and no legislature was convened.|$|E

25|$|The {{plane was}} refueled, and on April 13 took off again, this time heading for Algeria, which {{had given it}} {{permission}} to land there, and the final week of the hijack played <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> at Houari Boumedienne Airport in Algiers. Algeria – which had been {{a key player in}} the 1981 resolution of the Iran hostage crisis – began talks with the hijackers as soon as the plane touched down in Algiers. The aircraft was parked close to the terminal building, but was asked to move briefly as a security measure upon the arrival of a flight carrying President of Zambia Kenneth Kaunda.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} alliance, unified as the National Christian Party, gave {{itself a}} blue-shirted paramilitary corps that borrowed heavily from the Legion — the Lăncieri — and initiated an official campaign of persecution of Jews, attempting {{to win back}} the interest the public had in the Iron Guard. After much violence, Codreanu was approached by Goga and agreed to have his party withdraw from campaigning in the scheduled elections of 1938, believing that, in any event, the regime had no viable solution and would wear <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> — while attempting {{to profit from the}} king's authoritarianism by showing his willingness to integrate any possible one-party system.|$|E
25|$|During the {{resurgence}} in co-operation following {{the successes of}} the Rochdale Pioneers and the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS), the Co-operative Movement began to lift <b>itself</b> <b>out</b> of the decade of society failures between 1834 and 1844. The success brought pride but also anxiety for the movement's leaders {{as they began to}} fear that societies might forget their co-operative ideals in the face of material success. The solution, it was decided at the first of the modern Co-operative Congresses, was the creation of a national organisation that could hold the movement together and emphasise the important role that co-operatives could play in society at large.|$|E
