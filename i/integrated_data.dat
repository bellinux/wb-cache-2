25|$|Onslow {{underwent}} a modernisation refit from 1982 until 1984; becoming the third Australian Oberon to be modernised. As {{part of the}} modernisation, <b>integrated</b> <b>data</b> processing and fire control systems were installed, and the boat was fitted with Micropuffs passive ranging sonar. The torpedo payload was upgraded to the United States Mark 48 wire-guided torpedo. In addition to new torpedoes, the modernisation allowed Oberon-class submarines to carry and fire the Harpoon anti-ship missile through the torpedo tubes: Onslow became the first conventionally powered submarine {{in the world to}} be fitted with guided anti-ship missiles.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the main}} UK {{political}} parties had expressed {{concerns about the}} rising costs and value of a ten-yearly census, and on coming into office the UK coalition government had {{gone as far as}} suggesting that the 2011 census might be the last of its kind. In July 2010 the UK government asked ONS to explore other methods of measuring the population. In 2011 the three national statistics bodies, ONS, GROS and NISRA set up a co-ordinated research project known as Beyond 2011. The objectives of the programme were to assess the feasibility of improving UK population statistics using <b>integrated</b> <b>data</b> sources to replace or complement existing approaches, and whether alternative data sources could provide the priority statistics on the characteristics of small populations typically provided by a census. The project reported its findings in March 2014 and recommended that a UK-wide census in 2021 should take place, and that better use should be made of other demographic data sources.|$|E

A B-1 {{equipped with the}} fully <b>integrated</b> <b>data</b> link (FIDL) first flew on 29 July 2009; the FIDL enables electronic data sharing, eliminating the need to enter information between systems by hand. [...] In January 2013, Boeing delivered the first integrated battle station (IBS) equipped B-1. This replaced several displays with new multi-function color display units, an upgraded central integrated test system, and a newer aircraft performance monitoring computer. In June 2012, the B-1Bs are receiving Sustainment-Block 16 upgrades to add Link 16 networking and digital flight instrumentation.|$|E

Most of Bekele's work in these years {{has been associated with}} CBS International, a company she founded and served as President and Chief Executive Officer. CBS International is a California-based consulting company with focus on technology transfer to emerging markets. Primarily, the company provided international technology procurement, project-based capacity building, technological project management, internet/intranet systems integration and Internet related solutions. [...] As an affiliate, Bekele set up SbCommunications Network, plc, (SbCnet), based in Addis Ababa, specializing in technology integration and support services. Bekele was interested to do nation building projects that have high impact and yield to benefit society. Through her companies, she expressed interest and participated and won international contracts for large scale projects such as the information technology infrastructure for the Organization of African Unity (AU) General Secretariat and an <b>integrated</b> <b>data</b> networking infrastructure for the Ethiopian parliament, House of Peoplesâ€™ Representatives and House of Federation. The AU project was an e-government Internet-working project initiative, sponsored by UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) involving the implementation of a complex fiber-optic-based information technology campus wide area network infrastructure and considered one of the largest IT projects in the Country at the time. CBS International handled technological inputs and services procurement while SbCnet provided strategic technology integration services and field management and successfully commissioned the project ...|$|E

40|$|The {{design-build}} {{construction industry}} has recognized {{the advantages of}} a collaborative contracting method; however {{it has yet to}} create information systems that can truly support the industry. Many software applications have been created to assist the Design-Builder; however no software provider has created an application that can completely manage the design-build process from beginning to end. Although some software providers have attempted to <b>integrate</b> <b>data</b> between various project management activity modules (estimating, scheduling, accounting, etc), no software provider has resolved the need to <b>integrate</b> <b>data</b> between both project management activity modules and the various phases of the design-build life cycle. The advancements of the design-build industry method of contracting will never be fully achieved until an information system is designed to specifically support the industry. This paper details the conceptual development of a management control system designed to not only <b>integrate</b> <b>data</b> among various project management activities modules but also to <b>integrate</b> <b>data</b> between all phases of the design-build project life cycle.
