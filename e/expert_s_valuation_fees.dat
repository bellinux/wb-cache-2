40|$|We {{study how}} innovators can optimally design {{licensing}} contracts {{when there is}} incomplete information on the licensee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>valuation</b> of the innovation, and limited control over the licensee 2 ̆ 7 s development efforts. A licensing contract typically contains an up-front payment, milestone payments at successful completion of a project phase, and royalties on sales. We use principal-agent models to formulate the licensor 2 ̆ 7 s contracting problem, and we find that under adverse selection, the optimal contract structure changes with the licensee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>valuation</b> of the innovation. As the licensee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>valuation</b> increases, the licensor 2 ̆ 7 s optimal level {{of involvement in the}} development-directly or through royalties-should decrease. Only a risk-averse licensor should include both up-front and milestone payments. Moral hazard alone is not detrimental to the licensor 2 ̆ 7 s value, but may create an additional value loss when combined with adverse selection. Our results inform managerial practice about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the different terms included in licensing contracts and recommend the optimal composition of the contract.

40|$|The {{seller of}} N {{distinct}} objects is uncertain about the buyer 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>valuation</b> for those objects. The seller 9 ̆ 2 s problem, to maximize expected revenue, consists of maximizing a linear functional over a convex set of mechanisms. A {{solution to the}} seller 9 ̆ 2 s problem can always be found in an extreme point of the feasible set. We identify the relevant extreme points and faces of the feasible set. With N = 1, the extreme points are easily described providing simple proofs of well-known results. The revenue-maximizing mechanism assigns the object with probability one or zero depending on the buyer 9 ̆ 2 s report. With N > 1, extreme points often involve randomization in the assignment of goods. Virtually any extreme point of the feasible set maximizes revenue for a well-behaved distribution of buyer 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>valuations.</b> We provide a simple algebraic procedure {{to determine whether a}} mechanism is an extreme point...|$|R

40|$|I {{study the}} {{properties}} of optimal long-term contracts in {{an environment in which}} the agent. s type evolves stochastically over time. The model stylizes a buyer-seller relationship but the results apply quite naturally to many contractual situations including regulation and optimal income-taxation. I. rst show, through a simple example, that distortions need not vanish over time and need not be monotonic in the shock to the buyer. <b>s</b> <b>valuation.</b> These results are in contrast to those obtained in the literature that assumes a Markov process with a binary state space. e. g.

I then show that when the sets of possible types in any two adja-cent periods satisfy a certain overlapping condition (which is always satis. ed with a continuum of types), then the dynamics of the optimal mechanism can be signi. cantly simpli. ed by as-suming the shocks are independent over time. Under certain regularity conditions, the optimal mechanism is then the same irrespective of whether the shocks are the buyer. s private informa-tion or are observed also by the seller. These conditions are satis. ed, for example, {{in the case of an}} AR(1) process, a Brownian motion, but also when shocks have a multiplicative e as it is often the case in. nancial applications. Furthermore, the distortions in the optimal quantities are independent of the distributions of the shocks and, when the buyer. <b>s</b> <b>valuation</b> is additively separable, they are also independent of whether the shocks are transitory or permanent.

40|$|Hedge fund {{managers}} are compensated via management fees on the {{assets under management}} (AUM) and incentive fees indexed to the high-water mark (HWM). We {{study the effects of}} managerial skills (alpha) and compensation on dynamic leverage choices and the <b>valuation</b> of <b>fees</b> and investors' payoffs. Increasing the investment allocation to the alpha-generating strategy typically lowers the fund's risk-adjusted excess return due to frictions such as price pressure. When the manager is only paid via management fees, the manager optimally chooses time-invariant leverage to balance the size of allocation to the alpha-generating strategy against the negative impact of increasing size on the fund's alpha. When the manager is paid via both management and incentive fees, we show that (i) the high-powered incentive fees encourage excessive risk taking, while management fees have the opposite effect; (ii) conflicts of interest between the manager and investors have significant effects on dynamically changing leverage choices and the <b>valuation</b> of <b>fees</b> and investors' payoffs; (iii) the manager optimally increases leverage following strong fund performances; (iv) investors' options to liquidate the fund following sufficiently poor fund performances substantially curtail managerial risk-taking, provide strong incentives to de-leverage, and sometimes even give rise to strong precautionary motives to hoard cash (in long positions); and (v) managerial ownership concentration has incentive alignment effects. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises {{of three}} separate but related studies. The first study presents an analytical model {{that characterizes the}} revenue generation process for a popular kind of online auction, namely Yankee auctions. Such auctions sell multiple identical units of a good to multiple buyers using an ascending and open auction mechanism, which {{has its roots in}} the English auction, yet is significantly different. We put forward a portfolio of tools, varying in their level of abstraction and information intensity requirements, which help the auctioneers to maximize their revenues. The study sheds new light on how online auctions can be used to construct empirical demand curves for the auctioned goods. The methodologies used to validate the analytical model range from empirical analysis to simulation. A key contribution is the design of a partitioning scheme of the discrete valuation space of the bidders such that equilibrium points with higher revenue structures become feasible. Our analysis indicates that the auctioneers are, most of the time, far away from the optimal choice of key control factors such as the bid increment, resulting in substantial losses in a market with already tight margins. The second study uses available information to make inferences about bidder valuations. Using such information, we derive a priori estimates of the bidders valuations. We present an analytical model that predicts a consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>valuation</b> for a product, based on the joint consideration of the bidding strategy pursued and the bid values revealed, both of which are observable on the Internet. Subsequently, using an automated agent, we test the valuation prediction model against thousands of bids made on hundreds of real online auctions from Samsclub. com. Our data analysis is able to accurately “type” the bidding strategy based on observable variables, and is successful at predicting the bidder 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> eventual <b>valuation.</b> The third study is aimed at increasing the efficiency of multi unit ascending price auctions, armed with the ability to predict the bidder 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>valuation,</b> we use such a priori valuation information to increase the efficiency of the auctions through realtime calibration. We develop an analytical model for the auctioneer 2 ̆ 7 s revenue and derive optimal dynamic bid increments. We compare the auction outcomes based on the analytically prescribed bid increments and heuristics that are motivated by a deterministic effort to order the bidders 2 ̆ 7 sequence as they approach the final bidding round. Our empirical analysis indicates that auctioneers can derive the same or more expected revenue with fewer bidding cycles. ...|$|R
