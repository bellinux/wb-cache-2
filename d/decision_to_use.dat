40|$|In recent years, {{legislators have}} called upon private nonprofit and {{proprietary}} organizations {{to assume a}} larger role in provision of public benefits to poor persons. Little research, however, has examined poor people 2 ̆ 7 s willingness <b>to</b> <b>use</b> nonprofit agencies in lieu of public welfare. This analysis draws data from over 2 years of fieldwork and in-depth interviews with twenty poor women in Philadelphia. I demonstrate that <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> nonprofits are contingent upon stigma, information, practical predicaments (e. g., agency hours), and perceived need. I explore the implications of these impediments in a post-welfare reform landscape, while focusing on how <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> private services differ from those <b>to</b> <b>use</b> public welfare.

40|$|Wikis have {{significant}} potential to improve knowledge work and information sharing within organisations. But {{in spite of}} their usability and simplicity, adoption experience is varied. In this research we conducted an ethnographic study of wiki implementation to understand why some people chose <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the systems and others did not. We focused upon the influence of institutional scripts on information sharing behaviour. We found that certain norms and premises at the industry, organisational and sub-unit level appear <b>to</b> influence <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the wiki. This study contributes to the knowledge management literature by demonstrating the role of institutional scripts in <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> this software for knowledge sharing. It may also guide practitioners in planning for the introduction of social software and lead to further research into identifying social institutions in specific industry types, which influence users in their adoption decisions...|$|R

5|$|In Hastings's view, Lang was {{probably}} {{more sympathetic to}} Rome than any other Church of England archbishop of modern times, responsible for a discreet catholicisation of the Church of England's practices.

5|$|The Last Remnant {{was created}} by {{developers}} who had previously worked on games in the SaGa and Final Fantasy series. It was directed by Hiroshi Takai and produced by Nobuyuki Ueda. The game was written by Masato Yagi and Miwa Shoda whose work {{was based on a}} scenario concept by executive producer Akitoshi Kawazu. Kimihiko Miyamae was the chief artist, while Yusuke Naora served as both art producer and character designer. The game was the first game by Square Enix to use the Unreal Engine 3. Because they used a licensed engine rather than making their own, the production time it took to see graphical resources onscreen was cut significantly, allowing the team to begin illustrating and experimenting at an early stage. The <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a licensed engine, rather than develop their own as was traditional at Square Enix, was made due to concerns in the company of the rising production costs of making a game, and the direct development time savings possible from using an existing engine. Over a year after the game was released, on February 17, 2010, Square-Enix's chief technology officer Julien Merceron claimed in an interview that most of the game's perceived technical shortcomings were caused by a <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> the Unreal Engine to try to replace having as many skilled programmers as would be used otherwise.|$|E

40|$|Seventy-five {{parents of}} preschool-age {{children}} with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) completed surveys designed to identify factors considered when selecting an intervention approach for their child and to elucidate {{the relative importance of}} those factors in the decision-making process. For <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> interventions, the most important factor related to the individual needs of the child. This factor and several others; including staff attributes, whether the intervention was ASD-specific, and intuition/gut feelings, were weighted more highly than research evidence in both <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> and <b>to</b> reject interventions. When the individual factors were grouped pragmatically, the category representing service characteristics, including staff attributes and whether the intervention was ASD-specific, was ranked significantly higher in importance than all other categories.

40|$|Abstract Background The quantum {{increases}} in home Internet access and available online health information with limited control over information quality highlight {{the necessity of}} exploring decision making processes in accessing and using online information, specifically in relation to children who do not make their health <b>decisions.</b> Objectives <b>To</b> understand the processes explaining parents’ <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> online health information for child health care. Methods Parents (N = 391) completed an initial questionnaire assessing the theory of planned behaviour constructs of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control, as well as perceived risk, group norm, and additional demographic factors. Two months later, 187 parents completed a follow-up questionnaire assessing their <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> online information for their child’s health care, specifically to 1) diagnose and/or treat their child’s suspected medical condition/illness and 2) increase understanding about a diagnosis or treatment recommended by a health professional. Results Hierarchical multiple regression showed that, for both behaviours, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control, (less) perceived risk, group norm, and (non) medical background were the significant predictors of intention. For parents’ use of online child health information, for both behaviours, intention was the sole significant predictor of behaviour. The findings explain 77...|$|R
5|$|By 1976, a twinjet layout, {{similar to}} the one which had debuted on the Airbus A300, became the {{baseline}} configuration. The <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants. While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous, the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets. As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities. Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, new flight deck systems, aerodynamic improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7. Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757. Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Philip J. Currie, {{benefiting from}} much more {{extensive}} finds {{and a general}} increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods, compared several tyrannosaurid skulls {{and came to the}} conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought. The <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are sister taxa, more closely related to each other than to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus be retained as separate genera, as he concluded that they were no more similar than Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which are almost always separated. In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from Alaska and New Mexico, and Currie suggested that the Albertosaurus-Gorgosaurus situation may be clarified once these are described fully. Most authors have followed Currie's recommendation, but some have not.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} of what coolant to use attracted more debate. The Metallurgical laboratory's first choice was helium, {{because it could}} be both a coolant and a neutron moderator. The difficulties of its use were not overlooked. Large quantities would be required, {{and it would have}} to be very pure, with no neutron-absorbing impurities. Special blowers would be required to circulate the gas through the reactor, and the problem of leakage of radioactive gases would have to be solved. None of these problems were regarded as insurmountable. The <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> helium was conveyed to DuPont, the company responsible for building the production reactors, and was initially accepted.|$|E

5|$|The <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a {{straight}} or curved laryngoscope blade depends {{partly on the}} specific anatomical features of the airway, and partly on the personal experience and preference of the laryngoscopist. The Macintosh blade is {{the most widely used}} curved laryngoscope blade, while the Miller blade is the most popular style of straight blade. Both Miller and Macintosh laryngoscope blades are available in sizes 0 (infant) through 4 (large adult). There are many other styles of straight and curved blades, with accessories such as mirrors for enlarging the field of view and even ports for the administration of oxygen. These specialty blades are primarily designed for use by anesthetists and otolaryngologists, most commonly in the operating room.|$|E
5|$|A final {{decision}} was deferred {{until after the}} 1951 election. This resulted in a change of government, with the Conservative Party returning to power and Churchill replacing Attlee as Prime Minister. On 27 December 1951, the High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Australia informed Menzies of the British government's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Monte Bello. On 26 February 1952, Churchill announced in the House of Commons that the first British atomic bomb test would occur in Australia {{before the end of}} the year. When queried by a Labour Party backbencher, Emrys Hughes, about the impact on the local flora and fauna, Churchill joked that the survey team had only seen some birds and lizards. Among the AERE scientists was an amateur biologist, Frank Hill, who collected samples of the flora and fauna on the islands, teaming up with Commander G. Wedd, who collected marine specimens from the surrounding waters. In a paper published by the Linnean Society of London, Hill catalogued over 400 species of plants and animals. This included 20 new species of insects, six of plants, and a new species of legless lizard.|$|E
5|$|As {{proposed}} by the Admiralty, Moore's plans for the new attack on Kaafjord involved the Home Fleet's aircraft attacking the region over several days. While the fighter aircraft involved in the previous raids had used only their machine guns to strafe German defences {{in order to reduce}} the threat they posed to the Barracudas, it was decided to use some of these aircraft as dive bombers during Operation Goodwood. In preparation, the two squadrons of Corsairs and single squadron of Grumman F6F Hellcats selected to participate in the attack received training in dive-bombing tactics during the period between Operations Mascot and Goodwood. Another new element of the plans was a <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> Fleet Air Arm aircraft to drop mines near Tirpitz and the entrance to Kaafjord. The mines dropped near the battleship were to be fitted with time-delay fuses, and it was hoped that the explosions of these devices would cause Tirpitzs captain to try to move the warship into safer waters and pass through the minefield at the fjord's entrance. During the period before Operation Goodwood, the Home Fleet's flying squadrons conducted training exercises using a target range at Loch Eriboll in northern Scotland; the terrain in this area is comparable to that around Kaafjord, and the loch had also been used for this purpose as part of the preparations for Operation Tungsten.|$|E

40|$|The {{protection}} of the health of athletes {{is one of the}} three criteria taken into account when registering a substance in the World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited list. Nevertheless, in elite-level cycling, banned substance use is widespread. The present research adopted a psychological approach to examine how or whether perceived health risks influence elite-level cyclists' <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> banned substances. Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with cyclists hoping to join a professional team (n= 6), neo-professional cyclists (n= 2), and former professional cyclists (n= 8). Although an evolution was observed in the organization of doping and perceptions of doping over the last decade, the perceived health hazards did not influence, most of the time, <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> banned substances among the sample of cyclists. There was a systematization of exogenous substance use in the cycling environment and a trivialization of the side effects of the banned substances. Finally, younger cyclists were not concerned about the long-term health consequences of banned substances; they were more focused on the short-term performance-enhancing benefits. There is a need to implement more effective preventive programs to change athletes' attitudes toward doping and its health risks. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the losing}} {{and the poor}} attendance, the Buccaneers {{were one of the}} NFL's most {{profitable}} teams for most of Culverhouse's ownership. In 1989, only the Chicago Bears had higher profits than the 5–11 Buccaneers, who profited $6.3 million with the league's second-lowest payroll, while the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers lost $16.2 million. The team attributed their low salaries to the players' youth, stating that it was the coaches who had made the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> younger players, who drew lower salaries than veterans. This contributed to the perception that Culverhouse was not committed to fielding a quality team, although the rookie contracts he gave to Vinny Testaverde and Paul Gruber were so high as to upset other team owners, while he made Ray Perkins one of the five highest-paid NFL head coaches. He also offered Bill Parcells $6.5 million to coach the team, offered draft pick Bo Jackson a five-year, $7 million contract that was at the time the highest in NFL history for a rookie, paid Keith McCants an NFL-record $2.5 million signing bonus, and paid Steve Young $6 million in salary, plus another $1 million for the buyout of his USFL contract.|$|E
5|$|In 269, while Claudius Gothicus (Gallienus' successor) was {{defending}} {{the borders of}} Italy and the Balkans against Germanic invasions, Zenobia was cementing her authority; Roman officials in the East were caught between loyalty to the emperor and Zenobia's increasing demands for allegiance. The timing and rationale of the queen's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> military force to strengthen her authority in the East is unclear; scholar Gary K. Young suggested that Roman officials refused to recognize Palmyrene authority, and Zenobia's expeditions were intended to maintain Palmyrene dominance. Another factor {{may have been the}} weakness of Roman central authority and its corresponding inability to protect the provinces, which probably convinced Zenobia {{that the only way to}} maintain stability in the East was to control the region directly. Historian Jacques Schwartz tied Zenobia's actions to her desire to protect Palmyra's economic interests, which were threatened by Rome's failure to protect the provinces. Also, according to Schwartz, the economic interests conflicted; Bostra and Egypt received trade which would have otherwise passed through Palmyra. The Tanukhids near Bostra and the merchants of Alexandria probably attempted to rid themselves of Palmyrene domination, triggering a military response from Zenobia.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the poor results of the {{precision}} bombing campaign {{and the success of}} the 25February raid on Tokyo, and considering that many tons of incendiaries were now available to him, LeMay decided to begin firebombing attacks on Japan's main cities during early March 1945. This was in line with Arnold's targeting directive for XXIBomber Command, which specified that urban areas were to be accorded the second-highest priority for attacks after aircraft factories. The directive also stated that firebombing raids should be conducted once M-69 bombs had been tested in combat and the number of B-29s available was sufficient to launch an intensive campaign. LeMay did not seek Arnold's specific approval before launching his firebombing campaign, however, to protect the USAAF commander from criticism if the attacks were unsuccessful. The Twentieth Air Force's Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Lauris Norstad, was aware of the change in tactics though and provided support. The <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> firebombing tactics represented a move away from the USAAF's previous focus on precision bombing, and was believed by senior officials in the military and US Government to be justified by the need to rapidly bring the war to an end.|$|E
