40|$|A <b>dumping</b> margin <b>calculation</b> {{involves}} {{currency conversion}} {{of either the}} export price of the normal value. Although the Anti-dumping Agreement permits the conversion of currency when {{it is necessary for}} the price comparison, it does not provide a sufficient guideline to guard against potential distortion in the <b>dumping</b> margin <b>calculation</b> resulting from conversion. Unless the conversion is done with an appropriate exchange rate, an investigating authority's price comparison potentially results in a spurious estimate of dumping margin, in violation of the fair comparison requirement of Article 2. 4 of the Anti-dumping Agreement. In particular, the distortion in the <b>dumping</b> margin <b>calculation</b> is magnified when the exchange rate moves significantly. This paper reviews the currency conversion clause of the Anti-dumping Agreement and suggests modifications in order to address the shortcomings. currency conversion, anti-dumping agreement...|$|R

Importantly, the evolving effect of discretionary practices is due not only to increasing use of these practices over time, but to apparent changes in implementation of these practices that mean a higher increase in the dumping margin whenever they are applied. ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{literature}} has discussed the procedural biases {{that exist in}} U. S. Department of Commerce (USDOC) <b>dumping</b> margin <b>calculations.</b> This paper examines the evolution of discretionary practices and {{their role in the}} rapid increase in average USDOC dumping margins since 1980. Statistical analysis finds that USDOC discretionary practices have played the major role in rising dumping margins. Importantly, the evolving effect of discretionary practices is due not only to increasing use of these practices over time, but apparent changes in implementation of these practices that mean a higher increase in the dumping margin whenever they are applied. While legal changes due to the Uruguay Round are estimated to have reduced the baseline U. S. dumping margin by 20 percentage points, the increasingly punitive discretionary measures used by the USDOC almost completely compensated for this decrease by 2000. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the use of anti-dumping measures {{in order to make}} economic sense of what seems to amount to cheating on an international agreement. There are numerous loopholes in the Anti-dumping Agreement which allow anti-dumping measures {{to be used as a}} form of protection by import-competing industries against fair trade. Some of these loopholes are of a purely legal nature, while others are more practical. During an anti-dumping investigation, a dumping margin is calculated in order to establish whether or not an accused exporter is <b>dumping.</b> This <b>calculation</b> is known as the determination of dumping. In this thesis, the various ways in which the dumping margin can be manipulated or ”captured” are investigated. It is shown that there are numerous ways in which the determination of dumping result can be manipulated in order to ensure a positive dumping result. And economists are concerned about this abuse of anti-dumping as it could have a chilling effect on international trade. However, it is shown in this thesis that anti-dumping investigations are concentrated in certain sectors. In other words, anti-dumping measures (and other non-tariff remedies) are being used as a strategy to protect certain industries. Adam Smith, the ”father” of economics, pointed out that certain sensitive or strategic industries may need to be protected, even if such protection is at the cost of economic welfare. So, it seems that the economic issue is not really about dumping, but about whether or not certain strategic industries should be protected. And it is the protection of these strategic industries, for example the iron and steel industry, that needs further research. EconomicsD. Comm. (Economics...|$|R
40|$|During {{the slow}} dump (discharge) of the Barrel Toroidal (superconducting) magnet of the ATLAS detector, {{the control system}} gave an alarm that the {{differences}} between the voltages over the conductors were too high. The alarm was not due to any danger, because of some sort of phenomenon observed in the first few seconds after start of the discharge. A possible explanation of the differences of the coil voltages is that the changing current through the conductors may cause induced currents in the coil casing around. The goal was to make a simulation of the electrical behaviour of the magnet system during a slow dump. In this way, an explanation can be found for the start phenomenon of the slow dump of the Barrel Toroid. Some extra analyses on the measurements were performed to describe the energy dissipation during a fast dump. This is done by calculating the resistance of the coils during the dump. With the maximum resistance, the maximum temperature can be estimated, which says something about the enthalpy of the material. There is also found something about the RRR of the conductor and its relation to the properties of the quench. The results of the simulation of the Barrel Toroid as one coil were as expected. The simulation is correct and precise enough to reproduce the measurements. This simulation was extended to a simulation of the eight coils separately. The result was that a change up to 4 % in the resistance of the coil c asing can be the cause of the difference in the coil voltages {{in the beginning of the}} slow <b>dump.</b> The <b>calculations</b> of the energy dissipation during a fast dump of the BT showed that 73 % of the energy was stored in the conductor. The aluminium in the conductor stored 64 % of this energy and 17 % was stored in the isolation, the casing and the dump unit. Not for all the parts of the magnet the change in enthalpy is calculated. An undefined 10 % of the energy is also due to the inaccuracy of the calculations. By analysing a fast dump measurement of the Barrel Toroid, it appeared that a double pancake with a relative low RRR has a relatively higher maximum temperature after the dump, as expected. For both ECTs, the RRR is measured and calculated for all the double pancakes. The ECTs showed that a double pancake quenched later, when it has a higher value for the RRR with respect to other double pancakes...|$|R
