50|$|The {{house was}} {{originally}} {{designed as a}} mansion by architect Julia Morgan. Its most distinguishing <b>external</b> <b>feature</b> is the three-story red brick staircase {{leading up to the}} Warring entrance.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had Kirchweger condensers to pre-heat the feedwater. An <b>external</b> <b>feature</b> {{of that is}} {{the second}} chimney on the tender. Exhaust steam was led from the steam chest to the tender through a low-down, 100 mm, connecting pipe.|$|R
50|$|Both {{languages}} treat strings as (immutable) {{objects of}} reference type.

5|$|In Scotland {{there was}} {{a revival of the}} castle in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as part of the wider Gothic Revival movement, as new houses were built and {{existing}} buildings remodeled in the Gothic and Scots Baronial styles. Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 with design input from William Adam, displays the incorporation of turrets and is among the first houses in the revived style. His son Robert Adam's houses in this style included Mellerstain and Wedderburn in Berwickshire and Seton House in East Lothian, but it is most clearly seen at Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, remodelled by Adam from 1777. These were largely conventional Palladian style houses that incorporated some <b>external</b> <b>features</b> of the Scots baronial style.|$|E
5|$|Tailors {{started to}} take {{premises}} around Savile Row in the late 18th century, first in Cork Street, about 1790, then by 1803 in Savile Row itself. In 1846, Henry Poole, credited as creator of the dinner jacket or tuxedo, opened an entrance at 37 Savile Row from his late father's tailoring premises at 4 Old Burlington Street. As tailoring moved into the street, the house frontages were altered to bring natural light into the tailors' working area {{with the addition of}} glass frontages and light wells. The houses have been much altered over time; the original Burlingtonian design has been mostly lost, though No. 14 still retains much of the original <b>external</b> <b>features.</b>|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, saber-toothed cats {{have been}} artistically {{restored}} with <b>external</b> <b>features</b> {{similar to those}} of extant felids, by artists such as Charles R. Knight in collaboration with various paleontologists in the early 20th century. In 1969, paleontologist G.J. Miller instead proposed that Smilodon would have looked very different from a typical cat and similar to a bulldog, with a lower lip line (to allow its mouth to open wide without tearing the facial tissues), a more retracted nose and lower-placed ears. Paleoartist Mauricio Antón and coauthors disputed this in 1998 and maintained that the facial features of Smilodon were overall not very different from those of other cats. Antón noted that modern animals like the hippopotamus are able to achieve a wide gap without tearing tissue by the moderate folding of the orbicularis oris muscle, and such a muscle configuration exists in modern large felids. Antón stated that extant phylogenetic bracketing (where the features of the closest extant relatives of a fossil taxon are used as reference) is the most reliable way of restoring the life-appearance of prehistoric animals, and the cat-like Smilodon restorations by Knight are therefore still accurate.|$|E

50|$|The {{most notable}} <b>external</b> <b>feature</b> {{of the church}} is the 105 ft campanile. Many of the {{materials}} used in the church's construction were imported from Europe, including marble columns from Italy and 12th and 13th century stained glass from France.|$|R
25|$|There is {{generally}} a prominent <b>external</b> <b>feature</b> that rises upwards. It {{may be a}} dome, a central tower, two western towers or towers at both ends as at Speyer Cathedral. The towers may be finished with pinnacles or spires or a small dome.|$|R
5|$|Based on a {{courtyard}} house layout, externally the harled whinstone rubble mansion {{is a combination}} of Elizabethan and Jacobean (or Gothic) design, similar to Smith's work at Slains. A spacious central courtyard is surrounded by buildings three storeys high. Within the back of the courtyard, circular towers enclose the service stairways. A large Elizabethan-style tower housing the main stairway is also set within the courtyard but sited to the front behind the reception rooms. Other <b>external</b> <b>features</b> include: canted and box bays; a variety of lofty towers that are round, square or octagonal; many different gables; and numerous diagonally set stone flues. The southeast facing front elevation lacks symmetry with the main Tudor style entranceway set off centre and extending out. A plaque commemorating the building dates of 1839–1842 and a central armorial are above the round arched entrance. There is also an eight-sided tower positioned at the front corner. A separate driveway accesses the outside kitchen yard {{at the back of the}} north west elevation. This side of the mansion is plainer, more restrained and built into the slope of the hillside. A lengthy one storey lean-to houses fuel supplies and servants toilets and provides additional ground support. The northeast elevation is also more architecturally reserved than the front.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} fish {{is divided}} into a head, trunk and tail, {{although}} the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of cartilage, in cartilaginous fish, or bone in bony fish. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine {{and there are no}} limbs or limb girdles. The main <b>external</b> <b>features</b> of the fish, the fins, are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which {{with the exception of the}} caudal fins, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk. The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop. The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or middle ear. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a couple}} of <b>external</b> <b>features</b> {{that can be used to}} {{distinguish}} “pure” dingoes from other “pure” domestic dogs. However this might not be the case when concerning mixed-breed dogs and especially dingo-hybrids.|$|E
50|$|The <b>external</b> <b>feature</b> of {{the cross}} of the cathedral is also {{inferred}} to depict a view as though a devotee is bent on his knees offering prayers with his cloak flying backwards merging into the attractive concrete slab which is integral to the cathedral’s roof.|$|R
50|$|A central dome {{positioned}} {{over the}} {{crossing of the}} nave was the main <b>external</b> <b>feature</b> of the church until it collapsed in 1880 and was replaced with a flat roof. In 1898 the portico including the piazza {{to the front and}} railings was added by George Ashlin.|$|R
50|$|The {{striking}} <b>external</b> <b>feature</b> of {{the cathedral}} which attracts visitors at the entrance itself is the tall concrete structure which is shaped like an anthropomorphic giant. It is dominantly located on a hillock providing commanding views {{of the city of}} Abidjan, and overlooking the Bay of Cocody.|$|R
25|$|Generation {{identity}} {{occurs when}} an individual recognises that {{they are part of}} a particular social subgroup, a cultural generation, and concern themselves with the internalization of <b>external</b> <b>features</b> of the world. The reminiscence bump occurs during a period of life where people form their individual and generational identity. The earlier years of the reminiscence bump coincide with the formation of generation identity, while the later years coincide with the formation of adult identity.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{treatments}} vary as well. A 1975 checklist included six genera, {{whereas the}} 2003 {{volume of the}} Handbook of the Birds of the World, which covered the family, placed all the pittas in a single genus. The family was not well studied using modern anatomical or phylogenetic techniques; two studies, in 1987 and 1990, each used only four species, and comparisons amongst the family as a whole have relied mostly on <b>external</b> <b>features</b> and appearances.|$|E
25|$|Its most {{distinguishing}} feature, and {{origin of}} its common name, is {{the set of}} modified scales above the eyes that look much like eyelashes. The eyelashes are thought to aid in camouflage, breaking up the snake's outline among the foliage where it hides. B. schlegelii occurs {{in a wide range}} of colors, including red, yellow, brown, green, even pink, as well as various combinations thereof. It often has black or brown speckling on the base color. No <b>external</b> <b>features</b> distinguish the two sexes.|$|E
50|$|Like the Ego (Ego {{was based}} on the Intimidator) and other open bolt, poppet-valve-based markers, the Intimidator uses a solenoid to drive a {{pneumatic}} ram into a poppet valve, which causes it to open, firing the paintball. On earlier Intimidators, a recognizable <b>external</b> <b>feature</b> was a dual low-pressure chamber.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In digital {{radiography}} oversized images {{have to be}} assembled from multiple exposures. As the patient may have moved in between subsequent exposures, an <b>external</b> <b>feature</b> is exposed together with the anatomy. The exposures typically have a very small overlap which complicates the registration. We present an algorithm for fast automatic registration featuring robustness against noise, feature masking and feature displacement. Pivotal for this algorithm is an actual interpretation of an <b>external</b> stitching <b>feature</b> instead of a simple detection. The proposed method has been evaluated on 1900 pairs of clinical radiographs. ...|$|R

25|$|No {{distinguishing}} characteristic {{is currently}} one-hundred-percent reliable. Furthermore, results gained under captive conditions cannot be transferred one-on-one {{to the situation}} in the wild, because it is not known which characteristics permanently remain under the conditions of natural selection. Biology and behaviour of dingoes and other wild dogs are generally considered to be so similar, {{that it is difficult to}} discriminate between them. Furthermore, much of the information on dingoes might just as likely apply to any other wild dog in Australia. In addition, the external characteristics of living dingoes cannot always be reliably distinguished from dingo-hybrids; since many hybrids are visually indistinguishable from “pure” dingoes (e.g. hybrids resulting from mating with Australian Cattle Dogs). Even the colour variations, which are regarded as characteristics of the “pure” dingo, can be a hindrance when identifying hybrids and other domestic dogs, when they show the same colourations. Furthermore, historical records report black dingoes but did not mention black-and-tan ones. This colouration might have been overlooked; if not than this would be another feature of hybrids. During breeding experiments with dingoes and other domestic dogs, dogs were born that could not be distinguished from dingoes based on <b>external</b> <b>features</b> but had two heat-cycles annually even down to the third and fourth generation. In the case of skull features there is the problem that they don’t discriminate between the different degrees of dingo-content in the hybrids, are less and less effective the further the hybrid is genetically away from other domestic dogs and can only be used on already dead specimen. Methods like X-ray and CAT-Scans are possible, but impractical. Also signs of dingo attacks on livestock aren’t reliable as a distinguishing characteristic, since the attack methods and the success rate possible depends the most from the experience and motivation of the attacker and the reactions of the prey.|$|E
500|$|Small [...] {{feathers}} located {{behind the}} bird's eye, in {{one to four}} rows, which cover the ear opening (the ear of a bird has no <b>external</b> <b>features)</b> and may aid in the acuity of bird hearing.|$|E
500|$|Auricularia auricula-judae {{is similar}} to A.fuscosuccinea in colour and texture, and [...] "may be {{confused}} with it if only <b>external</b> <b>features</b> are considered". The spore and basidia sizes of the two species are slightly different, {{but this is not}} a reliable way to tell them apart. A.cornea is another similar species in the same genus, but has distinct internal differences, is normally more pilose (more covered in soft hair) and tends to fruit in larger numbers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} evolved {{similarly to}} how a medieval cathedral often evolved over time, with no fixed plan from the beginning. Indeed, Michael Snodin argues, [...] "the most striking <b>external</b> <b>feature</b> of Strawberry Hill was its irregular plan and broken picturesque silhouette". Walpole added new features over a thirty-year period, {{as he saw}} fit.|$|R

The most prominent <b>external</b> <b>feature</b> is the 40 ft (12 m) canoe-shaped radome under the forward fuselage {{that houses the}} 24 ft (7.3 m) side-looking APY-7 passive electronically scanned array antenna.|$|R
500|$|The Gothic {{revival in}} {{architecture}} {{has been seen}} as an expression of Romanticism and according to Alvin Jackson, the Scots baronial style was [...] "a Caledonian reading of the gothic". Some of the earliest evidence of a revival in Gothic architecture is from Scotland. Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 with design input from William Adam displays the incorporation of turrets. These were largely conventional Palladian style houses that incorporated some <b>external</b> <b>features</b> of the Scots baronial style. Robert Adam's houses in this style include Mellerstain and Wedderburn in Berwickshire and Seton House in East Lothian, but it is most clearly seen at Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, remodelled by Adam from 1777.|$|E
500|$|Castell Coch's <b>external</b> <b>features</b> and the High Victorian {{interiors}} led {{the historian}} David McLees {{to describe it}} as [...] "one of the greatest Victorian triumphs of architectural composition." [...] The exterior, based on 19th-century studies by the antiquarian George Clark, is relatively authentic in style, although its three stone towers were adapted by Burges to present a dramatic silhouette, closer in design to mainland European castles such as Chillon than native British fortifications. The interiors were elaborately decorated, with specially designed furniture and fittings; the designs include extensive use of symbolism drawing on classical and legendary themes. Joseph Mordaunt Crook wrote that the castle represented [...] "the learned dream world of a great patron and his favourite architect, recreating from a heap of rubble a fairy-tale castle which seems almost to have materialised from the margins of a medieval manuscript." ...|$|E
500|$|The unique {{style of}} great private houses in Scotland, later known as Scots baronial, has been located in origin {{to the period}} of the 1560s. It kept many of the {{features}} of the high walled Medieval castles that had been largely made obsolete by gunpowder weapons and may have been influenced by the French masons brought to Scotland to work on royal palaces. It drew on the tower houses and peel towers, with their parapets, corbels, and bartizans. The new estate houses built from the late sixteenth century by nobles and lairds were primarily built for comfort, not for defence, although they were often called castles. They retained many of these <b>external</b> <b>features</b> which had become associated with nobility, but with a larger ground plan. This was classically a [...] "Z-plan" [...] of a rectangular block with towers, as at Colliston Castle (1583) and Claypotts Castle (1569–88).|$|E
50|$|The cathedral is a 15th-century structure, {{built on}} the site of a sixth-century Christian church. There have been {{considerable}} additions to it since its construction, and its most notable <b>external</b> <b>feature</b> today is its neoclassical entrance. Other notable features include a Renaissance black marble portal and a baroque altar in the chapel of Santísmo.|$|R
50|$|The arcade {{formed by}} linking the chimneys, which {{rises above the}} roof, is a notable <b>external</b> <b>feature</b> of the building,reminiscent of the belvederes of Blenheim Palace and {{producing}} a 'castle air'.18 It is square in shape and open on the northeast.
