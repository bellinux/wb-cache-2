40|$|This {{is a work}} in progress. Please do not cite or quote. Comments welcome. The paper {{focuses on}} the change of {{administrative}} structure in the core of Estonian government. It is based on a mapping exercise started in 2008. The exercise has been led by an aim to find out {{what has happened to the}} government structure since regaining independence? How has it developed after the change of political system? The focus of the paper is on the ministries and their underlying government agencies (boards and inspectorates, as established by the Government of the Republic Act). Most of these agencies can be characterized today as regulatory agencies. The research is based on the analysis of various documentation (coalition agreements, legislative initiatives and their accompanying notes, records of <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parliament</b> Riigikogu) in which the intentions and details of the many establishments, mergers and reorganizations of government agencies have been conserved. It is concluded that the general trend of changes the core of Estonian government can be characterized as de-specialization, both on the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the structure. Most of the structural reshuffling has been sector-based. The reforms have been different from the NPM-type structural reforms in the Western democracies, both by their initial conditions and their content...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the introduction}} {{and operation of}} the Australian citizenship test. The test, first proposed in April 2006, came into operation on 1 October 2007, after eighteen months of <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parliament</b> and in the public arena. The central argument of this thesis is that while there was some dissension in the parliamentary debates and committee hearings {{leading up to the}} introduction of the test, it focused primarily on the minor details of a piece of legislation that was always going to proceed. The Howard government had arrived at its decision to implement a citizenship test long before it sought public input and was committed to introducing the test prior to the 2007 election. No amount of evidence, it seemed, was going to derail or even delay the introduction of an ideologically-based policy, which was implemented despite ample testimony from academics and refugee advocates who warned that the test would be problematic. The thesis also argues that the Australian Labor Party, unwilling {{in the context of the}} times to oppose any demonstration of Australian 'patriotism', was a compliant ally in the smooth passage of the legislation through the parliament. What emerged from a superficial and rushed parliamentary process was what many commentators had predicted: a flawed and discriminatory test that adversely affects the more vulnerable individuals in society while privileging others. The thesis also examines the Australian government's use of overseas citizenship testing regimes, particularly those of the United Kingdom, United States, Netherlands and Canada, to legitimise the implementation of its own test. The Australian government, however, had done little or no research into the criticisms of such regimes and was either ignorant or determinedly dismissive of the fact that all were highly contested and contentious. In addition, the government remained unswayed by the fact that little or no evidence exists, or is indeed ever likely to exist, that citizenship tests are effective in achieving their almost universally stated aims of improved social cohesion and migrant integration. In the years since the Australian citizenship test was introduced, successive governments have failed to acknowledge that it is impossible to match a test of knowledge about Australian history, customs and government with the legislative requirement that prospective citizens demonstrate a 'basic knowledge of the English language'. It is a point that was made repeatedly to the Howard government in the lead-up to the test's introduction and a point that has been repeatedly reinforced throughout the life of the test, much of which has been overseen by the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments. Such is the scale of the government's ignorance of matters related to language learning and language testing that the 2008 review of the citizenship test, chaired by Richard Woolcott, succeeded only in magnifying the test's already significant shortcomings, resulting in a revised test that is even more discriminatory than its predecessor...|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{accounts}} of the Gordon Riots of 1780 are studied closely in order to ultimately determine how Dickens‟s use of these accounts in Barnaby Rudge reveals {{his view of the}} cause of the riots. Newspapers, political magazines, diaries, and letters are examined to discover the contemporary views of who was responsible for causing the Gordon Riots. The same historical documents are again considered to compare and contrast details of the riots. The accounts are then discussed to compare various popular descriptions of Gordon within the historical documents to determine the opinions of contemporary authors regarding Gordon and the degree of his role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> riots. The choices Dickens made as a writer of his historical novel Barnaby Rudge are then considered.

40|$|The {{world wide}} {{financial}} crisis influences the business figures of land administration organisations dramatically, as {{the decline of}} the volatility of the real estate and credit market is manifest in many countries. An obvious management response in general is drastic budget cutting. As basic facilities for operational activities (i. c. property registration and cadastral survey) should be provided in any case, budget cuts might severely affect other further-reaching strategic ambitions. This happens precisely in a period where the demand for transparent markets, governance, e-government, and location based applications require robust and swift cadastral innovations. Although governments are also cutting down drastically, political support for cadastral innovations in support of these demands is more important than ever. This paper reports about the fragile balance between crisis and ambitions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dutch Kadaster, where <b>discussions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> finally turned out positively.
