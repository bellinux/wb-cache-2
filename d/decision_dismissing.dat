500|$|Sotomayor {{was part}} of the three-judge Second Circuit panel that affirmed the {{district}} court's ruling in Maloney v. Cuomo (2009). [...] Maloney was arrested for possession of nunchucks, which are illegal in New York; Maloney argued that this law violated his Second Amendment right to bear arms. The Second Circuit's per curiam opinion noted that the Supreme Court has not, so far, ever held that the Second Amendment is binding against state governments. On the contrary, in Presser v. Illinois, a Supreme Court case from 1886, the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment [...] "is a limitation only upon the power of Congress and the national government, and not upon that of the state". With respect to the Presser v. Illinois precedent, the panel stated that only the Supreme Court has [...] "the prerogative of overruling its own decisions," [...] and the recent Supreme Court case of District of Columbia v. Heller (which struck down the district's gun ban as unconstitutional) did [...] "not invalidate this longstanding principle". The panel upheld the lower court's <b>decision</b> <b>dismissing</b> Maloney's challenge to New York's law against possession of nunchucks. [...] On June 2, 2009, a Seventh Circuit panel, including the prominent and heavily cited judges Richard Posner and Frank Easterbrook, unanimously agreed with Maloney v. Cuomo, citing the case in their decision turning back a challenge to Chicago's gun laws and noting the Supreme Court precedents remain in force until altered by the Supreme Court itself.|$|E
