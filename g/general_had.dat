50|$|Other {{than the}} justices themselves, the Solicitor General {{is among the}} most {{influential}} and knowledgeable members of the legal community with regard to Supreme Court litigation. Five Solicitors <b>General</b> <b>have</b> later served on the Supreme Court: William Howard Taft (who served as the 27th President of the United States before becoming Chief Justice of the United States), Stanley Forman Reed, Robert H. Jackson, Thurgood Marshall, and Elena Kagan. Some who have had other positions {{in the office of the}} Solicitor <b>General</b> <b>have</b> also later been appointed to the Supreme Court. For example, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. was the Principal Deputy Solicitor General during the George H. W. Bush administration and Associate Justice Samuel Alito was an Assistant to the Solicitor General. Only one former Solicitor <b>General</b> <b>has</b> been nominated to the Supreme Court unsuccessfully, that being Robert Bork; however, no sitting Solicitor <b>General</b> <b>has</b> ever been denied such an appointment. Eight other Solicitors <b>General</b> <b>have</b> served on the United States Courts of Appeals.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the events in Final Fantasy X, in Final Fantasy X-2 the teachings of Yevon were no longer deemed valid, and {{association}} with machina and the Al Bhed people no longer sacrilegious.

5|$|The {{attack of}} Alexios's {{division}} initially caught Bryennios's men off guard, but, being veteran troops, they soon recovered {{and once again}} began to push it back. Retreating, Alexios's troops, and especially the Turks, employed skirmishing tactics, attacking the enemy line and then withdrawing swiftly, thus keeping their opponents at bay and weakening the coherence of their line. Some among Alexios's men chose to attack Bryennios, and the rebel <b>general</b> <b>had</b> to defend against several attacks himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{county was}} {{established}} on March1, 1827, by the Indiana General Assembly. It {{was named for}} Dr.Joseph Warren, {{who was killed in}} 1775 at the Battle of Bunker Hill, in which he fought as a private because his commission as a <b>general</b> <b>had</b> not yet taken effect. The short-lived town of Warrenton was the original Warren County seat, chosen by commissioners in March1828; the next year an act was passed calling for the seat to be relocated, and in June1829 it was moved to Williamsport.|$|E

5|$|The {{value to}} the sinecurist of an office like that of Paymaster of Marines lay {{not so much in}} the {{official}} salary attached to it, but in the lax accounting procedures associated with disbursement of funds, which allowed the official to retain large sums of public money in his own hands for many years until accounts were made up. The office of Paymaster <b>General</b> <b>had</b> been reformed in 1783 to avoid these abuses, but these changes had not yet been extended to the Marines during Villiers' tenure.|$|E
5|$|To {{bolster the}} new amendment, Grant {{relied on the}} army and signed {{legislation}} creating the Justice Department, primarily to enforce federal laws in the South. Where the attorney <b>general</b> <b>had</b> once been only a legal adviser to the president, he now led a cabinet department dedicated to enforcing federal law, including a solicitor general to argue on the government's behalf in court. Under Grant's first attorney general, Ebenezer R. Hoar, the administration was not very aggressive in prosecuting white Southerners who terrorized their black neighbors, but Hoar's successor, Amos T. Akerman, was more zealous.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not without}} conflict, European Canadians' early {{interactions}} with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. First Nations and Métis peoples {{played a critical}} part {{in the development of}} European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The Crown and indigenous peoples began interactions during the European colonization period, though the Inuit, in <b>general,</b> <b>had</b> more limited interaction with European settlers. However, from the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture. These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations. A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Claire's main storyline {{in season}} 2 is her advocacy, as Second Lady, for {{a sexual assault}} {{prevention}} bill. During her campaign for the bill a skeleton from her college days emerges: during a nationally televised interview, she admits that she was raped in college and that her rapist, Dalton McGinnis (Peter Bradbury), is now a high-ranking general. (She had earlier had an uncomfortable encounter with McGinnis at a White House dinner, during which she had told Frank what the <b>general</b> <b>had</b> done to her.) She also admits to having aborted a pregnancy that she claims {{was the result of}} the rape; it is later revealed that she in fact aborted Frank's child, with his consent. She then converts the focus on that issue into political support that becomes critical to the Underwoods' ascension to the Oval Office.|$|E
5|$|Cook County {{homeowners are}} {{eligible}} for a property-tax break on their primary residence, but a manager in Assessor's office was granted the homeowner's exemption on two homes. In 2012 Cook County Inspector General Blanchard subpoenaed the Assessor's office seeking documents related to the exemptions. Berrios ignored the subpoena, claiming that the County Inspector General has no authority over him. Blanchard filed suit against Berrios. Berrios is represented in the suit by Cook County State's Attorney Alvarez. On January, 15, 2014, a Cook County circuit court judge ruled that the County Inspector <b>General</b> <b>had</b> the authority to investigate the Assessor and all other independently elected County offices. On August 21, 2014, the judge ruled the Assessor must comply with the Inspector General's subpoena. On December 1, 2016, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Cook County Inspector General {{has the power to}} investigate the Cook County Assessor, affirming two lower court decisions.|$|E
5|$|German forces also {{operated}} in the Battle of Jarama, {{which began with}} a Nationalist offensive on 6 February 1937. It included German-supplied ground forces, including two batteries of machine guns, a tank division, and the Condor Legion's anti-aircraft guns. Bombing by both Republican and Nationalist aircraft helped ensure a stalemate. It showed up the inadequacy of the Legion's aircraft, faced with superior Soviet-made fighters. The Legion's efforts only partly mitigated what was a significant defeat for the Nationalists at the Battle of Guadalajara during March. A joint Italian-German <b>general</b> <b>had</b> been set up in January 1937 to advise Franco on war planning. The defeat of a significant Italian force and the growing Soviet superiority in tanks and aircraft led the Germans to support a plan to abandon the offensive on Madrid and instead concentrate a series of attacks on weaker Republican-controlled areas. While many countries believed motorised troops to have been proven less effective than first thought, it was the inadequacy of the Italians as a fighting force that dominated German thought.|$|E

5|$|In early 1950, St. Laurent {{considered}} recommending {{the appointment}} of Howe as governor general. The governor <b>general</b> <b>had</b> always been a British peer; many nationalists wanted a Canadian to hold the post, and St. Laurent agreed with them. The governor general, The Viscount Alexander, was due to retire by 1953, by which time Howe would be 68. St. Laurent saw this {{as a way of}} allowing his friend and colleague to step away from politics for a quieter life. The minister was willing to take the post, but the position unexpectedly opened early when Alexander was appointed to the British Cabinet. Howe decided he still had work to do as a minister. He was also reluctant to exchange real power for the nominal power of the governor generalship. St. Laurent recommended {{the appointment of}} Canadian-born Vincent Massey, who was duly appointed by King George VI.|$|E
5|$|In reserve, Farnese {{deployed}} a large battalion {{made up by}} the German regiments of Hannibal d'Altemps and Georg von Frundsberg, flanked on {{its right}} by troops of reiters under Duke Francis of Saxe-Lauenburg, elder brother of Duke Maurice, John Casimir's former lieutenant, and on its left by lancers under Pierre de Taxis. The remaining Spanish cavalry, led by Ottavio Gonzaga, covered the rear. Farnese led his troops personally, and before the battle was started, he scouted the Dutch position, having ordered his troops not to move until his return. On the Dutch side, while De la Noue and Norreys directed the men standing in Borgerhout, William of Orange witnessed the battle from the walls of Antwerp in company of archduke Matthias, brother of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, whom the States <b>General</b> <b>had</b> elected as Governor of the Netherlands {{in opposition to the}} deceased John of Austria.|$|E
5|$|It {{was more}} {{difficult}} to take Koroni. General Sébastiani showed up there on October 7 with a party from his brigade. The fort commander’s response was similar to those given at Navarino and Methoni. Sébastiani sent his sappers, who were pushed back by rocks thrown from atop the walls. A dozen men were wounded, among them Cavaignac and, more seriously, a captain, a sergeant and three sappers. The other French soldiers felt insulted and their <b>general</b> <b>had</b> great difficulty in preventing them from opening fire and taking the stronghold by force. The Amphitrite, the Breslaw and the Wellesley came to {{the assistance of the}} ground troops. The threat they posed led the Ottoman commander to surrender. On October 9, the French entered Koroni and seized 80 cannons and guns, along with numerous victuals and munitions.|$|E

5|$|Leo's {{success at}} Amorium was {{fortunately}} timed, since Maslama {{with the main}} Arab army had in the meantime crossed the Taurus Mountains and was marching straight for the city. In addition, as the Arab <b>general</b> <b>had</b> not received news of Leo's double-dealing, he did not devastate the territories he marched through—the Armeniac and Anatolic themes, whose governors he still believed to be his allies. On meeting up with Sulayman's retreating army and learning what had transpired, Maslama changed direction: he attacked Akroinon and from there marched to the western coastlands to spend the winter. On his way, he sacked Sardis and Pergamon. The Arab fleet wintered in Cilicia. Leo, in the meantime, began his own march on Constantinople. He captured Nicomedia, where he found and captured, among other officials, Theodosios's son, and then marched to Chrysopolis. In spring 717, after short negotiations, he secured Theodosios's resignation and his recognition as emperor, entering the capital on 25 March. Theodosios and his son were allowed to retire to a monastery as monks, while Artabasdos was promoted {{to the position of}} kouropalates and received the hand of Leo's daughter, Anna.|$|E
5|$|Lines {{had been}} {{hardening}} {{on the matter}} of slavery, and Democrats accused Harrison of being an abolitionist because of his membership, a half century earlier, in the Richmond Humane Society, an anti-slavery group; he had posted a mixed record on the issue while in Congress. On August 20, he gave a speech on the slave question at Carthage, Ohio, and stated that what occurred regarding slavery in a state was that state's business alone. He ignored the question of slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories, both {{under the jurisdiction of the}} federal government. The <b>general</b> <b>had</b> pledged that his door would always be open to his old soldiers, but others came as well, and he hosted an unending series of guests. This was especially difficult for him on Sundays, when his wife forbade political discussion. The economy continued to be poor in 1840, a fact that the Whigs never ceased to press, arguing that Van Buren had done little, and that Harrison's inauguration was needed to put a stop to the hard times.|$|E
5|$|Moyer, who {{had never}} argued before the Supreme Court, {{continued}} to represent Jacobson (who was in the audience). In his brief and at oral argument, he said that a mere stated interest in sex among young men did not rise {{to a level of}} proving predisposition, that the government should have had evidence in hand that Jacobson was actually willing to break the law to do so. (Kenneth Starr, then Solicitor <b>General,</b> <b>had</b> maintained in the government's brief opposing certiorari that his prior purchase of the Bare Boys magazines was all the proof it needed, even if the action were legal at the time.) Pressed on other undercover investigative techniques, he admitted that a government-run pawn shop would be a permissible way to apprehend thieves despite a lack of evidence of predisposition because the crimes might well have occurred prior to any contact with the government or its operatives.|$|E
