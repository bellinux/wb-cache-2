5|$|The Australian {{zoologist}} William <b>Dakin</b> in his 1941 book The Art of Camouflage followed Thayer {{in describing}} countershading in some detail, {{and the book}} was reprinted as a military handbook in 1942. <b>Dakin</b> photographed model birds, much as Thayer and Cott had done, and argued that the shoulders and arms of battledress should be countershaded.|$|E

5|$|A Braxy-like disease {{originated}} in the Beverley-York region in 1915. Over the next 15 years it spread across most of the state's farming districts. Flock losses generally were around 5% though there were reported cases of 30% loss. In 1918 Professor <b>Dakin</b> of the University of Western Australia identified the disease as a toxaemia of bacterial origin {{but was unable to}} establish the source.|$|E
5|$|Countershading is {{less often}} used for {{military}} camouflage, despite Second World War experiments that showed its effectiveness. English zoologist Hugh Cott encouraged the use of techniques including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the British authorities. Soldiers often wrongly viewed camouflage netting {{as a kind of}} invisibility cloak, and they had to be taught to look at camouflage practically, from the enemy observer's point of view. At the same time in Australia, zoologist William John <b>Dakin</b> advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Much later, during World War I in 1916, a {{standardized}} and diluted modification of Labarraque's solution containing hypochlorite (0.5%) and boric acid as an acidic stabilizer, {{was developed by}} Henry Drysdale <b>Dakin</b> (who gave full credit to Labarraque's prior work in this area). Called Dakin's solution, the method of wound irrigation with chlorinated solutions allowed antiseptic treatment {{of a wide variety}} of open wounds, long before the modern antibiotic era. A modified version of this solution continues to be employed in wound irrigation in modern times, where it remains effective against bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics (see Century Pharmaceuticals).|$|E
5|$|As in the First World War, {{artists were}} pressed into service; for example, the surrealist painter Roland Penrose became a {{lecturer}} at the newly founded Camouflage Development and Training Centre at Farnham Castle, writing the practical Home Guard Manual of Camouflage. The film-maker Geoffrey Barkas ran the Middle East Command Camouflage Directorate during the 1941–1942 {{war in the}} Western Desert, including the successful deception of Operation Bertram. Hugh Cott was chief instructor; the artist camouflage officers, who called themselves camoufleurs, included Steven Sykes and Tony Ayrton. In Australia, artists were also prominent in the Sydney Camouflage Group, formed under the chairmanship of Professor William John <b>Dakin,</b> a zoologist from Sydney University. Max Dupain, Sydney Ure Smith and William Dobell were {{among the members of}} the group, which worked at Bankstown Airport, RAAF Base Richmond and Garden Island Dockyard.|$|E
5|$|There are {{extensive}} dunes of unconsolidated Holocene sand {{along both}} {{the western and}} eastern sides of the island. The topography of these dunes varies with time: in 1913, <b>Dakin</b> recorded the dunes as being a good deal higher in the east than in the west, but in 1960 Storr found the eastern dunes to be severely eroded, apparently because of a fire that burnt much of the island's vegetation in 1935. In {{the centre of the}} island is a low plain with a sinkhole in its southwest corner and a small salt lake near its northern edge. The soil in the centre of the plain is shallow loam, whereas the rim is deeper and composed largely of shell fragments.|$|E

25|$|The front {{exterior}} {{entrance to}} the <b>Dakin</b> building originally featured a large stone sculpture of a teddy bear, hewn from natural stone.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s the R. <b>Dakin</b> Company {{assembled}} a large collection {{of contemporary art}} from artists worldwide. The media included watercolor, oil painting, serigraph, lithograph, etching, collage, ceramic plate, sculpture and mixed media. These pieces were used to grace {{the interior of the}} <b>Dakin</b> Building, and were hung in literally all public areas, conference rooms, hallways and the atrium. The collection featured some well-known artists and some rising artists, who were not well established at that time. Some of the artists featured are Jeff Glenn, tapistry artist; Barbe; Marachal; Heiliger; Marlatt; Frings; Dudley and Garber. When C. Michael Hogan purchased the building in 1990, he hung some of his art collection to add to the museum character of the building, including a well-known suite of Roberto Matta. When <b>Dakin</b> left the building, Hogan purchased the bulk of the <b>Dakin</b> art collection.|$|E
