5|$|Determined {{and with}} renewed hope, Twilight leads her best friends back to Ponyville, which Discord has altered in a chaotic manner: The <b>day-night</b> <b>cycle</b> is {{haphazard}} and buildings float off the ground. Discord continues to taunt Twilight, {{but she is}} determined {{to get back to}} the library in town to find a way to defeat Discord while her best friends' personalities continue to become more warped, losing even more of their color until they are completely monochrome. Managing to get them all into the library, Twilight and Spike locate the book about the Elements of Harmony and after a brief scuffle with the other ponies over the book, are surprised and delighted to find the book actually contains the Elements. She forces her best friends to wear the Elements, though they are more willing to help after she angrily states that the sooner they defeat Discord, the sooner they never have to see each other again; Twilight also assigns Spike as the temporary Element of Loyalty because Rainbow Dash is not present. They go to face Discord, but the Elements fail to activate. The other four ponies and Spike quickly drop the elements and depart, leaving Twilight despondent and finally losing her own color.|$|E
5|$|Bravely Default is a {{role-playing}} game (RPG) {{which features}} a party of four characters navigating the fantasy world of Luxendarc. Navigation in towns, dungeons and the world map environments are done from an angled, third-person overhead view: the character remains still, the camera zooms out to a distant view. These environments are displayed on the top screen of the Nintendo 3DS system, while the bottom screen displays maps of environments, party stats and other information such as item menus. On the world map, a <b>day-night</b> <b>cycle</b> alters the types of enemies present, and after {{a certain point in}} the story an airship can be used to speed up travel and access previously inaccessible areas. In towns, players can interact with non-playable characters (NPCs), purchase items or magic at specialized shops, buy or sell weapons and equipment at an armory, or rest at an inn to restore health points (HP) and magic points (MP). In all environments, the party can find chests containing items, weapons or equipment. During certain points, a Party Chat option appears, giving players the option of initiating conversations between the party members. During exploration, standard enemies appear through random encounters: outside battle, the counter rate can be adjusted from high to nothing. The game features multiple difficulty levels, which can be adjusted freely outside battle.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} an open world environment with a <b>day-night</b> <b>cycle</b> and dynamic weather system {{which can be}} seamlessly explored. The map is composed of forest, jungle, desert, and snowy mountain regions. Mountainous terrain is traversed with the employment of parkour, which is aided {{by the use of}} zip-lines installed throughout the world. Corruption Zones constitute areas that heighten difficulty and are populated by corrupted machines that behave with more aggression. To uncover more of the map, one must scale large giraffe-like machines known as Tallnecks. Twenty-five robotic creature designs are present in the game. Save points and fast travel can be accessed by interacting with campfires, once discovered. The quest structure unfolds to accommodate the exploration of tribes, while the main story covers the entire world. Side quests involve Aloy completing tasks, like gathering materials, coming to the aid of individuals in danger of being killed, solving mysteries, assuming control of bandit camps, eliminating criminals and more difficult machines, accomplishing various challenges at any of the five Hunting Grounds, and obtaining an ancient armour that makes Aloy almost impervious to damage. A dialogue wheel is used to communicate with non-playable characters. Collectibles include vantages that offer visual information of the Old World; metal flowers, which when acquired contain poetry; and old relics, such as ancient mugs and tribal artefacts.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{locations}} {{reflect the}} dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, with added survival horror elements. Paranormal phenomena, such as shadow figures, hallucinations, and unexplained noises are present, and, {{for the most}} part, the player has to rely on their lighter and rechargeable flashlight to navigate the darkness. Locations will often have an intricate layout, and the game lacks any form of map or objective marker, leaving the player to try finding their objectives with only a compass. The surface is more lethal than the metro system. Featuring a <b>day-night</b> <b>cycle,</b> and a dynamic weather system, these sections are severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times because of the toxic air. The player must collect air filters for the gas mask. These last several minutes each, and are automatically replaced provided the player has more in reserve. Players are also tasked to wipe off the dirt and blood splatter that collects on the gas mask. There is no head up display indicator to tell how long the player has until the gas mask's filters begin to fail â€” rather, a timer on the character's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. The watch also serves to indicate to a player {{if they have been}} exposed to enemy attention. With every weapon, the bullets are (partly) visible, informing the player that their weapon is about to run out of ammunition and they have to reload. Instead of head up display the game makes use of audio and visual cues to present information to players.|$|E

25|$|The game {{revolves}} around an undercover agent named Kyle Crane who {{is sent to}} infiltrate a quarantine zone in a city called Harran. It features an enemy-infested, open-world city with a dynamic day and night cycle. The <b>day-night</b> <b>cycle</b> changes the game drastically, as enemies become more aggressive {{and more difficult to}} deal with during night time. The gameplay is focused on weapons-based combat and parkour. The game also features an asymmetrical multiplayer mode (originally set to be a pre-order bonus); and a four-player, co-operative multiplayer mode.|$|E

It {{was developed}} by Yoshio Kiya, who {{would go on to}} create the Dragon Slayer and Brandish series of action RPGs. While its RPG elements were limited, lacking traditional statistical or leveling systems, the game featured real-time combat with a gun, bringing it close to the action RPG formula that Falcom would later be known for. The game's desert island overworld also featured a <b>day-night</b> <b>cycle,</b> non-player characters the player could attack or converse with, and the need to survive by finding and consuming rations to restore hit points lost with each normal action.|$|E

40|$|Time {{and space}} are {{fundamental}} to human language and embodied cognition. In our early work we investigated how Lingodroids, robots {{with the ability}} to build their own maps, could evolve their own geopersonal spatial language. In subsequent studies we extended the framework developed for learning spatial concepts and words to learning temporal intervals. This paper considers a new aspect of time, the naming of concepts like morning, afternoon, dawn, and dusk, which are events that are part of <b>day-night</b> <b>cycles,</b> but are not defined by specific time points on a clock. Grounding of such terms refers to events and features of the diurnal cycle, such as light levels. We studied event-based time in which robots experienced <b>day-night</b> <b>cycles</b> that varied with the seasons throughout a year. Then we used meet-at tasks to demonstrate that the words learned were grounded, where the times to meet were morning and afternoon, rather than specific clock times. The studies show how words and concepts for a novel aspect of cyclic time can be grounded through experience with events rather than by times as measured by clocks or calendar...|$|R

25|$|C. lectularius only feeds {{every five}} to seven days, which {{suggests}} {{that it does not}} spend the majority of its life searching for a host. When a bed bug is starved, it leaves its shelter and searches for a host. If it successfully feeds, it returns to its shelter. If it does not feed, it continues to search for a host. After searchingâ€”regardless of whether or not it has eatenâ€”the bed bug returns to the shelter to aggregate before the photophase (period of light during a <b>day-night</b> <b>cycle).</b> Reis argues that two reasons explain why C. lectularius would return to its shelter and aggregate after feeding. One is to find a mate and the other is to find shelter to avoid getting smashed after eating.|$|E
25|$|It has responsive, {{advanced}} {{artificial intelligence}} (AI) and dynamic environments. The <b>day-night</b> <b>cycle</b> influences some monsters (and their powers), as a werewolf becomes powerful {{during the night}} of a full moon. Players can learn about their enemies and prepare for combat by reading the in-game bestiary. When they kill an enemy, they can loot its corpse for valuables. Geralt's witcher sense enables players to find objects of interest, including items that can be collected or scavenged. Items are stored in the inventory, which can be expanded by purchasing upgrades. Players can sell items to vendors (who pay in crowns) or use them to craft potions and bombs. They can visit blacksmiths to craft new weapons and armour with what they have gathered. The price of an item {{and the cost of}} crafting it vary, depending on a region's local economy.|$|E
25|$|Size is not {{the only}} factor in making red dwarfs {{potentially}} unsuitable for life, however. On a red dwarf planet, photosynthesis on the night side would be impossible, since it would never see the sun. On the day side, because the sun does not rise or set, areas in the shadows of mountains would remain so forever. Photosynthesis as we understand it would be {{complicated by the fact that}} a red dwarf produces most of its radiation in the infrared, and on the Earth the process depends on visible light. There are potential positives to this scenario. Numerous terrestrial ecosystems rely on chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis, for instance, which would be possible in a red dwarf system. A static primary star position removes the need for plants to steer leaves toward the sun, deal with changing shade/sun patterns, or change from photosynthesis to stored energy during night. Because of the lack of a <b>day-night</b> <b>cycle,</b> including the weak light of morning and evening, far more energy would be available at a given radiation level.|$|E
40|$|Animals {{partition}} {{their daily}} activity rhythms through their internal circadian clocks, which are synchronized by oscillating <b>day-night</b> <b>cycles</b> of light. The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster senses <b>day-night</b> <b>cycles</b> {{in part through}} rhodopsin-dependent light reception in the compound eye and photoreceptor cells in the Hofbauer-Buchner eyelet. A more noteworthy light entrainment pathway is mediated by central pacemaker neurons in the brain. The Drosophila circadian clock is extremely sensitive to light. However, the only known light sensor in pacemaker neurons, the flavoprotein cryptochrome (Cry), responds only {{to high levels of}} light in vitro. These observations indicate that there is an additional light-sensing pathway in fly pacemaker neurons. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized rhodopsin, Rh 7, which contributes to circadian light entrainment by circadian pacemaker neurons in the brain. The pacemaker neurons respond to violet light, and this response depends on Rh 7. Loss of either cry or rh 7 caused minor defects in photoentrainment, whereas loss of both caused profound impairment. The circadian photoresponse to constant light was impaired in rh 7 mutant flies, especially under dim light. The demonstration that Rh 7 functions in circadian pacemaker neurons represents, to our knowledge, the first role for an opsin in the central brain...|$|R

Then, we propose a set-point for the light attenuation factor in order to optimize microalgae productivity under constant illumination. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate how the adaptive controller can be used to optimize biomass productivity under realistic <b>dayâ€“night</b> <b>cycles...</b>|$|R

25|$|York may {{explore the}} Greenvale on foot, by car, or {{by using a}} special item {{obtained}} by completing a sidequest. Cars must be maintained, as they consume fuel, which York must purchase, and accumulate damage that eventually renders them useless unless York pays for their repair. York often has a specific time frame for investigating sites and interviewing non-player characters; however, if he misses the timeslot, the player may simply try again during the next day without a penalty. Places of business and entertainment venues in Greenvale have specific hours of operation and must be visited at the proper time {{to make use of}} their services. Non-player characters also have their own specific routines and travel around town as they go about their business. It also features a dynamic weather system and <b>day-night</b> <b>cycle</b> which affects the responses of the non-player characters. If York engages one at the right place and time of day, he or she may offer him a side-quest to perform for additional rewards. In addition to side-quests, trading cards are scattered throughout the town, which the player can collect while exploring. York can also participate in mini-games, such as darts, racing through checkpoints, and fishing, and may accelerate the passing of time by smoking cigarettes.|$|E

So, the use of biofuels has gained an extraordinary importance and microalgae {{seem to be a}} promising feedstock, as they do not compete with food either for arable land or for potable water. Also, they produce several interesting compounds such as sugars and lipids. The aim of this dissertation was the study of sugar production by Spirogyra sp. regarding the production of bioethanol. So, the first step was the cultivation of this chlorophyte under continuous lighting and <b>day-night</b> <b>cycles</b> (14 h/ 10 h), to evaluate the effect of light regime on the growth and sugar accumulation. Methods for cell rupture and sugars extraction were also studied and optimized. A yeast screening towards the production of ethanol from microalgae hidrolysates was the final step of this work. The highest biomass concentration was attained under <b>day-night</b> <b>cycles</b> (0, 34 Â± 0, 05 vs. 0, 29 Â± 0, 02 gL- 1) but the greatest sugar accumulation occurred in the presence of continuous illumination (27 vs. 24 % g eqglu. g biomass- 1). From all the tested methods for cellular disruption of Spyrogira sp., the most appropriate was acid hydrolysis by sulfuric acid 2 N in autoclave for 30 min (78 % extracted sugars).

40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 18 JUN 2014 The plant circadian clock controls various physiological phenomena {{that are important}} for adaptation to natural <b>day-night</b> <b>cycles.</b> Many components of the circadian clock {{have been identified in}} Arabidopsis thaliana, the model plant for molecular genetic studies. Recent studies revealed evolutionary conservation of clock components in green plants. Homologues of clock-related genes have been isolated from Lemna gibba and Lemna aequinoctialis, and it has been demonstrated that these homologues function in the clock system {{in a manner similar to}} their functioning in Arabidopsis. While clock components are widely conserved, circadian phenomena display diversity even within the Lemna genus. In order to survey the full extent of diversity in circadian rhythms among duckweed plants, we characterised the circadian rhythms of duckweed by employing a semi-transient bioluminescent reporter system. Using a particle bombardment method, circadian bioluminescent reporters were introduced into nine strains representing five duckweed species: Spirodela polyrhiza, Landoltia punctata, Lemna gibba, L. aequinoctialis and Wolffia columbiana. We then monitored luciferase (luc+) reporter activities driven by AtCCA 1, ZmUBQ 1 or CaMV 35 S promoters under entrainment and free-running conditions. Under entrainment, AtCCA 1 ::luc+ showed similar diurnal rhythms in all strains. This suggests that the mechanism of biological timing under <b>day-night</b> <b>cycles</b> is conserved throughout the evolution of duckweeds. Under free-running conditions, we observed circadian rhythms of AtCCA 1 ::luc+, ZmUBQ 1 ::luc+ and CaMV 35 S::luc+. These circadian rhythms showed diversity in period length and sustainability, suggesting that circadian clock mechanisms are somewhat diversified among duckweeds...|$|R
500|$|The mycelia of this species, {{grown in}} {{laboratory}} culture, {{have also been}} shown to be bioluminescent. Early studies demonstrated that short-wave ultraviolet light (at a wavelength of 280nm) reversibly inhibited the luminescence of P.stypticus mycelia, while longer wavelength (366nm) ultraviolet was stimulatory. Further, the fungus exhibited a pronounced diurnal periodicity, and maximum luminescence was noted between 6 and 9 pm, regardless as to whether the mycelial cultures were incubated in continuous light, continuous darkness, or a normal <b>day-night</b> <b>cycle.</b> The mycelia of P.stipticus grown submerged in liquid were non-luminescent, but became luminescent while growing on solid substrata. Dark-grown colonies were luminescent in the center, and light-grown colonies were brightest at the periphery. Other experiments have shown that growth temperature and pH {{have a significant effect on}} the level of bioluminescence, optimized at [...] and pH 3â€“3.5. However, light had a significant effect on mycelial growth but not on bioluminescence, and the optimal light conditions for maximum bioluminescence were total darkness.|$|E
500|$|Circadian rhythm effects {{describe}} {{the tendency for}} humans to experience a normal cycle in attentiveness and sleepiness through the 24-hour day. Those with a conventional sleep pattern (sleeping for seven or eighthours at night) experience periods of maximum fatigue {{in the early hours}} of the morning and a lesser period in the early afternoon. During the low points of this cycle, one experiences reduced attentiveness. During the high points, it is difficult to sleep soundly. The cycle is anchored in part by ambient lighting (darkness causes a person's body to release the hormone melatonin, which induces sleep), and by a person's imposed pattern of regular sleeping and waking times. The influence of the <b>day-night</b> <b>cycle</b> is never fully displaced (standard artificial lighting is not strong enough to inhibit the release of melatonin), and the performance of night shift workers usually suffers. Circadian rhythms are persistent, and can only be shifted by one to twohours forward or backward per day. Changing the starting time of a work shift by more than these amounts will reduce attentiveness, which is common after the first night shift following a [...] "weekend" [...] break during which conventional sleep times were followed.|$|E

Food and water are vital to Max's survival; the player can collect them in the wasteland and use them to replenish their health. Max can also eat small animals, such as rodents, and maggots from decomposing corpses, to replenish his health, and areas where he can find food and supplies have crows flying around them. The player can venture into the Big Nothing, an uncharted, volatile area of the wasteland with dangerous sandstorms and no food or water in which rare parts for the Magnum Opus can be found.
