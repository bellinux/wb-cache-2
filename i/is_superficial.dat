5|$|The eggs {{have large}} yolks; {{cleavage}} (division) <b>is</b> <b>superficial</b> and a germinal disc develops at the pole. During gastrulation, {{the margins of}} this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel develop {{as part of the}} foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo develops.|$|E
5|$|Tuatara, {{along with}} other, now extinct {{members of the}} order Sphenodontia, belong to the {{superorder}} Lepidosauria, the only surviving taxon within Lepidosauromorpha. Squamates and tuatara both show caudal autotomy (loss of the tail-tip when threatened), and have transverse cloacal slits. The origin of the tuatara probably lies close to the split between the Lepidosauromorpha and the Archosauromorpha. Though tuatara resemble lizards, the similarity <b>is</b> <b>superficial,</b> because the family has several characteristics unique among reptiles. The typical lizard shape is very common for the early amniotes; the oldest known fossil of a reptile, the Hylonomus, resembles a modern lizard.|$|E
5|$|Completely unskilled at combat, Quark {{stands to}} either lose Grilka or be killed. Worf again helps the Ferengi; using a special device {{implemented}} by Dax, Worf {{is able to}} control Quark's body movements from an adjacent holosuite and help Quark defend himself with a bat'leth. Although the device temporarily malfunctions, he ultimately defeats the bodyguard. The scene concludes with Grilka and Quark alone and enamored with one another. Worf opines to Jadzia that Quark is unworthy of such a great Klingon woman, and she counters that Worf's interest in Grilka <b>is</b> <b>superficial,</b> asserting that there are better options awaiting him. Observing that Worf still fails to see the subtext in her hints, Dax initiates an aggressive romantic encounter. In the next scene, both couples are shown in the infirmary; Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) treats their wounds and quickly deduces {{the source of their}} injuries.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} pathologic {{change is}} {{the formation of a}} plug (a microcomedone), which is driven primarily by excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells in the hair follicle. In normal skin, the skin cells that have died come up to the surface and exit the pore of the hair follicle. However, increased production of oily sebum in those with acne causes the dead skin cells to stick together. The accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the hair follicle, thus forming the microcomedone. This is further exacerbated by the biofilm created by P. acnes within the hair follicle. If the microcomedone <b>is</b> <b>superficial</b> within the hair follicle, the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance (known as a blackhead or open comedo). In contrast, if the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair follicle, this causes the formation of a whitehead (known as a closed comedo).|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{restoration}} {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} milling. Typically, chemical milling is used to slowly remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until the serial number is brought back to the surface. This can be performed due to the depth that serial numbers are engraved into the weapon. However, chemical restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the serial number <b>is</b> <b>superficial.</b> Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the serial number used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when the serial number was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an acid, that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type of chemical that is used depends on the material the weapon is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, cupric chloride, and distilled water, to an acidic ferric chloride solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.|$|E
5|$|Sicily's second city, Catania, was {{the most}} damaged of all the larger cities in 1693, with only the medieval Castello Ursino and three tribunes of the cathedral remaining. Thus it was replanned and rebuilt. The new design {{separated}} the city into quarters, divided by two roads meeting at an intersection known as the Piazza del Duomo (Cathedral Square). Rebuilding was supervised by the Bishop of Catania, and the city's only surviving architect, Alonzo di Benedetto. Di Benedetto headed a team of junior architects called in from Messina, which quickly began to rebuild, concentrating first on the Piazza del Duomo. Three palazzi are situated here, the Bishop's Palace, the Seminario and one other. The architects worked in complete harmony and {{it is impossible to}} distinguish di Benedetto's work from that of his junior colleagues. The work is competent but not remarkable, with decorated rustication in the 17th-century Sicilian style, but often the decoration on the upper floors <b>is</b> <b>superficial.</b> This is typical of the Baroque of this period immediately after the earthquake.|$|E

25|$|Refractory corneal ulcers {{can take}} a long time to heal, {{sometimes}} months. Topical antibiotics are used continually to prevent infection. Pain medications are given as needed. Loose epithelium is removed with a dry cotton swab under topical anesthesia. This is in order to allow production of normal basement membrane and division of normal epithelium. Often further treatment is necessary, such as a keratotomy, which <b>is</b> <b>superficial</b> cutting or piercing of the cornea. There are two main types used in dogs: multiple punctate keratotomy (MPK) and grid keratotomy (GK). MPK involves making small superficial punctures into the cornea with a needle. GK is more commonly used and involves making parallel and perpendicular scratches in the corneal surface. Usually only topical anesthesia is necessary. By scoring the corneal surface, anchoring points are provided for attachment of new epithelium. Of course, these procedures should only be performed by a veterinarian, particularly one with some experience in this treatment. Complete healing takes about three to four weeks. Keratotomies may lead to corneal sequestration in cats. Other medications have been shown to be useful in topical treatment of refractory ulcers, including glycosaminoglycans such as sodium hyaluronate and chondroitin sulfate, aminocaproic acid, and acetylcysteine.|$|E
500|$|A special Icewind Dale {{adventure}} {{was featured}} {{as the centerpiece}} at the November 3, 2007, Worldwide Dungeons and Dragons Game Day event, {{in honor of the}} 20th anniversary of the creation of Drizzt. According to PopMatters' Andrew Welsh, Drizzt is Salvatore's attempt to create a multifaceted character who faces internal struggles, in hopes of standing out from the drow, and fantasy fiction in general. Welsh feels that Salvatore fails in this regard, saying [...] "any blood Drizzt finds on his hands is quickly justified and most “internal” conflict <b>is</b> <b>superficial</b> at best." [...] A review for Pyramid refers to Drizzt as the [...] " [...] most famous denizen" [...] of Menzoberranzan, identifying him and the city as [...] "some of the most famous pieces of the Realms". Rob Bricken of Kotaku called Drizzt [...] "one of the Mary Sue-iest characters in all of fiction".|$|E
500|$|Justin Ravitz of PopMatters {{called the}} series a [...] "cleverly trashy postmodern soap" [...] and {{credited}} it for reviving {{the soap opera}} genre, which he felt had disappeared but still suited American culture. He compared the pilot to Sex and the City, declaring it [...] "could potentially replace the departed Sex as the TV Sunday ritual for women and gay men everywhere, although DH is the guiltier pleasure of the two." [...] However, he noted the contrasting tones and dynamics between the two series, and stated that the friendships between Desperate Housewives four leading women seemed [...] "tenuous," [...] opining, [...] "the sisterly, sugar-swapping connection between the surviving women <b>is</b> <b>superficial,</b> and clearly vulnerable to shifting alliances, acts of betrayal and crowd-pleasing cat-fights." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety called the pilot [...] "oodles of fun." [...] He complimented the cast, stating that while Hatcher provides [...] "the emotional core" [...] of the series, [...] "nearly everyone is intriguing {{in one way or}} another," [...] and predicted that Eva Longoria would become the show's breakout star. However, Lowry noted that Desperate Housewives may be [...] "a little too smart for its own good" [...] and expressed concern over the series' [...] "soapy elements." [...] Tom Shales of The Washington Post praised the pilot, assessing, [...] "In visual style, witty language, borderline surrealism and overall mad attitude, [...] stands on a mountaintop all its own, the best new drama of the season and perhaps the best new comedy, too." [...] He complimented Cross and Hatcher's performances, as well as the writing for the Mary Alice character's narrations. The Futon Critic selected the pilot as the 26th best television episode of 2004.|$|E
