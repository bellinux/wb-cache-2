5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E
5|$|All {{surviving}} sources, except Pliny the Elder, characterize Caligula as insane. However, it is {{not known}} whether they are speaking figuratively or literally. Additionally, given Caligula's unpopularity among the surviving sources, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> fact from fiction. Recent sources are divided in attempting to ascribe a medical reason for his behavior, citing as possibilities encephalitis, epilepsy or meningitis. The {{question of whether or not}} Caligula was insane (especially after his illness early in his reign) remains unanswered.|$|E

5|$|Americium {{has been}} {{produced}} in small quantities in nuclear reactors for decades, and kilograms of its 241Am and 243Am isotopes have been accumulated by now. Nevertheless, {{since it was}} first offered for sale in 1962, its price, about 1,500 USD per gram of 241Am, remains almost unchanged owing to the very complex separation procedure. The heavier isotope 243Am is produced in much smaller amounts; it is thus more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>separate,</b> resulting in a higher cost of the order 100,000–160,000 USD/g.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Akodon boliviensis group, {{including}} A.caenosus, {{are generally}} similar and <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>separate,</b> but they differ in relative cranial measurements {{and some other}} characters. A.spegazzinii is larger than A.caenosus; A.sylvanus is darker and has less contrast between the upper- and underparts and less well-developed eye-rings; A.polopi has a squared interorbital region and more well-developed ridges on its skull; and A.boliviensis is paler and has more densely furred ears.|$|E

50|$|Though {{the term}} {{development}} usually refers to economic progress, it {{can apply to}} political, social, and technological progress as well. These various sectors of society are so intertwined that it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> neatly <b>separate</b> them. Development in all these sectors is governed by the same principles and laws, and therefore the term applies uniformly.|$|R
5|$|Hafnium is a shiny, silvery, {{ductile metal}} that is {{corrosion-resistant}} and chemically similar to zirconium (due to its {{having the same}} number of valence electrons, being in the same group, but also to relativistic effects; the expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly cancelled out by the lanthanide contraction). The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> because of their chemical similarity.|$|E
5|$|It is {{relatively}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> ytterbium from other lanthanides {{due to its}} similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange, as can other lanthanides. The solution is then applied to a resin, which different lanthanides bind in different matters. This is then dissolved using complexing agents, and due to {{the different types of}} bonding exhibited by the different lanthanides, it is possible to isolate the compounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} is {{distinguished}} from the black-throated loon (G. arctica) and the red-throated loon (G. stellata) mainly by its larger size. It usually has a steeper forehead and a bulging forecrown, somewhat similar to the black-throated loon. Its bill is heavier and the back is paler than its hindneck. It is more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> from the yellow-billed loon, but its breeding plumage has more white markings on the neck and the squares on its shoulders are usually smaller; the non-breeding plumage has darker neck-sides contrasting more sharply with pale areas and bill colour.|$|E

5|$|There are {{theoretically}} {{no restrictions}} {{on where the}} ketogenic diet might be used, and it can cost less than modern anticonvulsants. However, fasting and dietary changes are affected by religious and cultural issues. A culture where food is often prepared by grandparents or hired help means more people must be educated about the diet. When families dine together, sharing the same meal, it can be <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> the child's meal. In many countries, food labelling is not mandatory so calculating the proportions of fat, protein and carbohydrate is difficult.

5|$|Three Himalayan {{subspecies}} of Eurasian treecreeper are now sometimes given full species {{status as}} Hodgson's treecreeper, for example by BirdLife International, {{but if they}} are retained as subspecies of Eurasian, they have to be distinguished from three other South Asian treecreepers. The plain tail of Eurasian treecreeper differentiates it from bar-tailed treecreeper, which has a distinctive barred tail pattern, and its white throat is an obvious difference from brown-throated treecreeper. Rusty-flanked treecreeper is more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> from Eurasian, but has more contrasting cinnamon, rather than buff, flanks.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} atomic bombs were {{developed}} concurrently during the war: {{a relatively simple}} gun-type fission weapon and a more complex implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Thin Man gun-type design proved impractical to use with plutonium so a simpler gun-type called Little Boy was developed that used uranium-235, an isotope that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. Chemically identical to the most common isotope, uranium-238, and with almost the same mass, it proved <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> the two. Three methods were employed for uranium enrichment: electromagnetic, gaseous and thermal. Most of this work was performed at the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.|$|E

30|$|Indeed, {{the most}} <b>difficult</b> issue is <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> moving objects from {{stationary}} objects. A classical approach in indoor environments {{is to use}} appearance-based or feature-based techniques with cameras and laser [7 – 9]. Both methods rely on prior knowledge of the targets. In an outdoor context, there are many types of mobile objects such as pedestrians, animals, vehicles of different sizes (cars, trucks, etc.), which are all very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> detect and identify.|$|R
5|$|Vavilovian mimicry {{presents}} {{an illustration of}} unintentional (or rather 'anti-intentional') selection by man. Weeders {{do not want to}} select weeds and their seeds that look increasingly like cultivated plants, yet there is no other option. For example, the Echinochloa oryzoides plant, a species of grass found as a weed in rice (Oryza sativa) fields, looks similar to rice; its seeds are often mixed in rice and have become <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> through Vavilovian mimicry. Vavilovian mimics may eventually be domesticated themselves, {{as in the case of}} rye in wheat; Vavilov called these weed-crops secondary crops.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium {{is found}} with other rare earth {{elements}} in several rare minerals. It is most often recovered commercially from monazite sand (0.03% ytterbium). The element {{is also found in}} euxenite and xenotime. The main mining areas are China, the United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka, and Australia. Reserves of ytterbium are estimated as one million tonnes. Ytterbium is normally <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> from other rare earths, but ion-exchange and solvent extraction techniques developed in the mid- to late 20th century have simplified separation. Compounds of ytterbium are rare and have not yet been well characterized. The abundance of ytterbium in the Earth's crust is about 3mg/kg.|$|E
5|$|Found {{with almost}} all other rare-earth metals but never by itself, {{lutetium}} is very <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> from other elements. The principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite: (Ce, La, etc.)PO4 which contains 0.0001% of the element. The abundance of lutetium in the Earth crust {{is only about}} 0.5mg/kg. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. The world production of lutetium (in the form of oxide) is about 10 tonnes per year. Pure lutetium metal {{is very difficult to}} prepare. It is one of the rarest and most expensive of the rare earth metals with the price about US$10,000 per kilogram, or about one-fourth that of gold.|$|E

5|$|In April 1944, {{tests on}} the first sample of {{plutonium}} that had been produced with neutrons in a nuclear reactor revealed that reactor-bred plutonium contained five times more plutonium-240 than that hitherto produced in a cyclotrons. This unwanted isotope that spontaneously decayed and produced neutrons promised to cause a predetonation without sufficiently quick critical mass assembly. It now became apparent that only implosion would work for practical plutonium bombs; a powerful enough gun could not be constructed small enough to be carried in an aircraft, and plutonium-240 was even more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> from plutonium-239 than the isotopes of uranium that were giving {{the rest of the}} Manhattan Project such difficulties. Plutonium was unusable unless implosion worked, but only plutonium could be produced in quantities that would allow regular production of atomic bombs. Thus, the implosion technique now suddenly stood as the key to production of nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{control of}} Texas was {{followed}} by Mexican control of Texas, {{and it can be}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> the Spanish and Mexican influences on the future state. The most obvious legacy is that of the language; the state's name comes from the Spanish rendering of an Indian word. Every major river in modern Texas, except the Red River, has a Spanish or Anglicized name, as do 42 of the state's 254 counties and numerous towns also bear Spanish names. Even many of the words that have been incorporated into American English, such as barbecue, canyon, ranch, and plaza, come from Spanish words. An additional obvious legacy is that of Roman Catholicism. At the end of Spain's reign over Texas, virtually all inhabitants practiced the Catholic religion, and it is still practiced in Texas by a large number of people. The Spanish missions built in San Antonio to convert Indians to Catholicism have been restored and are a National Historic Landmark.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{census data}} {{available}} on demographic history or trends for Shaktism or other traditions within Hinduism. Estimates vary {{on the relative}} number of adherents in Shaktism compared to other traditions of Hinduism. According to a 2010 estimate by Johnson and Grim, the Shaktism tradition is the smaller group with about 30 million or 3.2% of Hindus. In contrast, Galvin Flood states that Shaivism and Shaktism traditions are <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>separate,</b> as many Shaiva Hindus revere the goddess Shakti regularly. The denominations of Hinduism, states Julius Lipner, are unlike those found in major religions of the world, because Hindu denominations are fuzzy with individuals revering gods and goddesses henotheistically, with many Shaiva and Vaishnava adherents recognizing Sri (Lakshmi), Parvati, Saraswati {{and other aspects of}} the goddess Devi. Similarly, Shakta Hindus revere Shiva and goddesses such as Parvati (such as Durga, Radha, Sita and others) and Saraswati important in Shaiva and Vaishnava traditions.|$|E
