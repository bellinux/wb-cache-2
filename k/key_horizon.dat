40|$|Six {{sediment}} cores {{from two}} of four depocentres in the Most Basin, mostly consisting of macrofossil barren fluviodeltaic and lacustrine sediments of Holešice and Libkovice members of the Most Formation (lower Miocene, Burdigalian) were subjected to chemostratigraphic correlation, based on CEC and EDXRF proxy element analyses. CEC-step, prominent K/Al minima and crandallite-bearing horizons in monotonous lacustrine mudstones of the Libkovice Member provide several local isochronous or nearly isochronous <b>key</b> <b>horizons,</b> which we propose for a basin-scale correlation of the upper Most Basin sediment fill. These <b>key</b> <b>horizons</b> prove a spatially uniform sedimentary environment in a single lake (original area ˜ 1, 000 km 2) during deposition of a considerable part of the siliciclastics overlying the main coal seam that tops the lower basin fill. We propose the CEC-step horizon as a novel boundary between Holešice and Libkovice members, i. e. the conversion of previously formal lithostratigraphic units to members with an isochronous boundary. That boundary together with recent sedimentological studies would assign Břešťany clay {{to the top of}} the Holešice Member. The upper boundary of the Libkovice Member could be the sediment coarsening related to a lake level decrease before deposition of Lom coal seam. The study will allow progress in palaeogeographic and palaeoenviromental reconstruction of the lower Miocene in the Most Basin. The proxy analyses (CEC vs Al/Si ratios) allow reliable numeric differentiation between kaolinite-rich, smectite-poor and smectite-rich clay assemblages in Holešice and Libkovice members. The plots of CEC vs Al/Si ratios should be applicable for fingerprinting any other monotonous lacustrine clastics with variable mineralogy of the clay assemblage...|$|R

The various identified regional structural elements are grouped into six tectonically active periods: Late Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic, Late Jurassic, Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic.

40|$|Bronze Age as {{a period}} of {{separation}} from a resilient complex of traditions of Mesolithic and even Palaeolithic origin. Extending this insight to recent findings in archaeoastronomy, this paper treats the sarsen monument at Stonehenge as one {{among a number of}} monuments with lunar-solar alignments which privileged night over day, winter over summer, dark moon over full. The aim of the monument builders was to juxtapose, replicate and reverse certain <b>key</b> <b>horizon</b> properties of the sun and the moon, apparently with the intention of investing the sun with the moon’s former religious significance.

40|$|This study {{provides}} an integrated {{view of the}} growth patterns and factors that controlled {{the evolution of the}} Gulf of Cadiz continental margin based on studies of the tectonic, sedimentologic and oceanographic history of the area. Seven sedimentary regimes are identified, but there are more extensive descriptions of the late Cenozoic regimes because of the larger data base. The regimes of the Mesozoic passive margin include carbonate platforms, which become mixed calcareous–terrigenous deposits during the Late Cretaceous–early Tertiary. The Oligocene and Early Miocene terrigenous regimes developed, in contrast, over the active and transcurrent margins near the African–Iberian plate boundary. The top of the Gulf of Cadiz olistostrome, emplaced in the Late Miocene, is used as a <b>key</b> <b>horizon</b> to define the ‘post-orogenic’ depositional regimes. The Late Miocene progradational margin regime is characterized by a large terrigenous sediment supply to the margin and coincides with the closing of the Miocene Atlantic–Mediterranean gateways. The terrigenous drift depositional regime of the Early Pliocene resulted from the occurrence of high eustatic sea level and the characteristics of the Mediterranean outflow currents that developed after the opening of the Strait of Gibraltar. The Late Pliocene and Quaternary regimes are dominated by sequences of deposits related to cycles of high and low sea levels. Deposition of shelf-margin deltas and slope wedges correlate with regressive and low sea level regimes caused by eustasy and subsidence. During the highstand regimes of the Holocene, inner shelf prograding deltas and deep-water sediment drifts wer...|$|E
40|$|A simple, reliable, and {{efficient}} method has been elaborated for direct determination of isotopic composition of authigenic uranium in siliceous lacustrine sediments. The method {{is based on}} studying kinetics of selective extraction of authigenic uranium from sediments by weak solutions of ammonium hydrocarbonate followed by ICP-MS analysis of nuclides. To estimate contamination of authigenic uranium by terrigenous one contents of 232 Th and some other clastogenic elements in the extracts were measured simultaneously. Selectivity of extraction of authigenic uranium from the sediments treated with 1 % NH 4 HCO 3 solution appeared to be no worse than 99 %. The method was applied to analysis of isotopic composition of authigenic uranium at several <b>key</b> <b>horizons</b> of the earlier dated core from the Baikal Lake. Measurements directly show that 234 U/ 238 U values in Baikal water varied depending on climate, which contradicts existing hypotheses. Measured 234 U/ 238 U ratios in water of the paleo-Baikal match corresponding values reconstructed from isotopic data for total uranium in the sediments on supposition that U/Th ratio is constant in terrigenous fraction of the sediments. Direct experimental determination of total and authigenic nuclides in sediments enhances potentiality of the method for 234 U- 230 Th dating of non-carbonate lacustrine sediments including those from the Baikal Lake within intervals corresponding to periods of glaciation, when sediments were rich in terrigenous components. Portions of terrigenous and authigenic uranium are well separated and we can study variability of sources of terrigenous matter and refine the earlier model for reconstructing climate humidity in the East Siberia...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} the results of a detailed multidisciplinary study of the near surface geology of the Dogger Bank in the southern central North Sea, forming part of a site investigation for a major windfarm development undertaken by the Forewind consortium. It has revealed that the Dogger Bank is internally complex rather than comprising a simple “layer cake” of the Quaternary sediments as previously thought. Regional and high-resolution seismic surveys have enabled a revised stratigraphic framework to be established for the upper part of this sequence which comprises the Eem (oldest), Dogger Bank, Bolders Bank formations and Botney Cut Formation (youngest), overlain by a typically thin Holocene sequence. Detailed mapping of <b>key</b> <b>horizons</b> identified on the high-resolution seismic profiles has led to the recognition of a series of buried palaeo-landsystems which are characterised by a range of features including; glacial, glacifluvial and fluvial channels, a large-scale glacitectonic thrust-moraine complex with intervening ice-marginal basins, a lacustrine basin and marine ravinement surfaces. Interpretation of these buried landscapes has enabled the development of an environmental change model to explain the evolution of the Dogger Bank. This evolution was driven by the complex interplay between climate change, ice sheet dynamics and sea level change associated with the growth and subsequent demise of the British and Irish and Fennoscandian ice sheets during the Weichselian glaciation. Following the decay of these ice sheets the Dogger Bank entered a period of significant climatic and environmental flux which saw a terrestrial landscape being progressively inundated as sea levels rose during the Holocene...|$|R
40|$|Structural model {{building}} software, Midland Valley’s MoveTM, {{was used to}} reduce uncertainty around fault geometry and analyse the likelihood of encountering fault-driven enhanced permeability for a proposed geothermal heat production borehole in Shiremoor, UK. Stress {{analysis was used to}} predict dilatant or compressional damage zones, and to assess likely permeability, under the present day stress regime. Before assessing whether a particular fault will have increased or decreased permeability, it was first necessary to build a structurally valid, constrained fault framework. Two seismic lines from the project area show evidence of faulting and deformation of horizons. After a simple depth conversion was applied, assuming average velocities for known lithologies, interpretation of the two lines, with additional information from the geological reports, maps and borehole data nearby allowed the construction of a first pass 3 D valid structural model of the site using MoveTM software. All geological models constructed by Midland Valley use structural geology principles (such as bed length or area balance) and known geometric relationships between faults and folds to build structurally valid models. This valid geological model was analysed to give insights as to the type of material that might be entrained in the fault cores, the amount of displacement on individual faults and hence potential damage zone sizes and critically the geometry and relationship to <b>key</b> <b>horizons</b> of the fault framework. Stress analysis of the linkage of faults was used to highlight potential areas of either compressional or dilatant damage zones and hence the predicted impact on fault permeability. </p...|$|R
40|$|The central High Atlas (Morocco) {{constitutes}} a diapiric province that hosts a complex array of elongated diapirs and minibasins that formed during the Lower Jurassic rift of the Atlas Basin. This paper aims {{to study the}} structure and growth evolution of the Tazoult diapiric wall, located in the central High Atlas, by means of structural and sedimentological fieldwork integrated with remote sensing mapping. The Tazoult salt wall is a 20 km long× 3 km wide NE-SW trending ridge that exposes Upper Triassic red beds and basalts along its core. The succession flanking the salt wall ranges from Hettangian to Bajocian ages displaying spectacular sedimentary wedges in the SE and NW flanks. The Hettangian-early Sinemurian carbonates mainly crop out as blocks embedded in the core rocks. The 1 km thick Pliensbachian platform carbonates display large subvertical flap structures along the flanks of the Tazoult salt wall with unconformities bounding tapered composite halokinetic sequences. In contrast, the 2. 5 km thick late Pliensbachian-Aalenian mixed deposits form tabular composite halokinetic sequences displaying small-scale hook halokinetic sequences. Passive diapirism resulted in the lateral extrusion of the evaporite-bearing rocks to form an allochthonous salt sheet toward the adjacent SE Amezraï minibasin. The Bajocian platform carbonates partially fossilized the Tazoult salt wall and thus constitute a <b>key</b> <b>horizon</b> to constrain the timing of diapir growth and discriminate diapirism from Alpine shortening.

During late Neogene a thick succession of Naust Formation prograded westward. This prograding wedge built out as an interaction of several processes like climatic fluctuations, relative sea level changes, glacial processes, basin infill and development of continental ice sheets in Scandinavia. The {{purpose of this study}} is to do sequence stratigraphic analysis of the Late-Cenozoic outbuilding. Ten 2 D seismic lines of high resolution from offshore mid-Norway were interpreted. Sequence stratigraphic analysis reveals 32 seismic sequences developed by 30 glaciation during last 2. 8 m. y. Facies analysis describes different kinds of sedimentary environments that was active during deposition of Naust Formation. Ages of the seismic sequences within the Naust Formation (2. 8 Ma-Present) have been interpolated between <b>key</b> <b>horizons</b> dated in previous studies.

Relative sea level changes occurred frequently during deposition of the Naust Formation. During early Naust time (SS 1 -SS 13) the depocentre was northeastern Vøring Basin and northeastern Trøndelag Platform which gradually shifted towards the south with increase in sedimentation rate.

40|$|Mound {{structures}} {{were discovered in}} 3 provinces in the Porcupine Seabight, along the continental margin southwest of Ireland. One of them, the Magellan Province, contains mainly buried mound structures, although a few mounds also protrude up to the seabed, at 600 to 750 m depth. Comparison with other (seabed) mounds in the area allowed their identification as coral banks or carbonate mounds, associated {{with the growth of}} deep-sea coral species such as Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata. The mounds in the Magellan Province were studied by means of high-resolution 2 D and industrial 3 D seismic data. The 3 D data set consisted of the upper 400 ms TWT of a 830 km 2 industrial data block, provided by Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Ltd., and its partners, Conoco (U. K.) Ltd., Enterprise Energy Ireland Ltd. and Dana Petroleum plc. Time structure maps of <b>key</b> reflections and <b>horizon</b> slices were further processed in a GIS-system using mathematical morphology and geostatistical toolsThe resulting images revealed 305 mounds (> 30 m) within an area of 350 km 2. They all are rooted on the same reflection. Smaller buildups {{can be seen in the}} seismic profiles too, but were excluded from the statistical analyses. The mounds are significantly elongated in a N/S direction, and are associated with moat structures containing the same - even stronger- elongation. A N/S directed current influence seems to have played an important role in the mound history. The location and spatial pattern of the mounds however, is different. Investigations showed that mound positions are not linked to any fault information present in the shallow 3 D data block. A possible relationship with the depth contours of <b>key</b> <b>horizons</b> or erosional unconformities, or with the morphology of an underlying enigmatic slope failure seems more promising. According to spatial trend analysis, the mounds are larger on the western edge of the province, while the burying sediment packages are thicker towards the (S) E. Sedimentation rates hence seem to have influenced the mound growth and vitality as well. From the 2 and 3 D seismic analysis of the Magellan Mound Province, one learns that the mounds started to grow at 1 confined moment in time and space. Their positioning does not seem to be influenced by shallow faults, but rather by the location of erosional unconformities and a deeper lying slope failure. Currents and sedimentation patterns on their turn clearly played a role in the mound development...|$|R

30|$|In addition, two tuffs {{samples were}} {{analyzed}} to further constrain {{the age of}} the Arbasay Formation in the studied interval. These quickly deposited tuffs (tephra layers) are regionally compared (Fig.  4). Thus, the tephra layers are excellent <b>key</b> <b>horizons</b> for dating of associated non-volcanic sedimentary sequences (Manville et al. 2009). Sample 15 JG- 14 from the upper part of Arbasay Formation clustered around two groups (315 [*]±[*] 3  Ma and 304 [*]±[*] 2  Ma). As the tuffs not only appear before the eruption (“pre-eruptive” units), but also after the eruption (“post-eruptive” units), the older age of 315 [*]±[*] 3  Ma therefore is interpreted to represent the commencing timing of the Arbasay volcanism, and the younger age of 304 [*]±[*] 2  Ma for the demise time of the phreatomagmatic activity (Manville et al. 2009; Ross et al. 2005; White et al. 2009). The Arbasay Formation therefore was likely deposited from 315  Ma to 304  Ma after excluding the influence of the inherited zircons. Furthermore, the tuff (Sample 15 JG- 28) of {{the upper part of the}} Arbasay Formation gave a weighted mean age of 310 [*]±[*] 3  Ma when the inherited zircon ages are irrespective. This age correlates well with the major volcanism of the Arbasay Formation (“syn-eruptive” units), which again suggested that their peak volcanism occurred during the Late Carboniferous (310 – 307  Ma; Fig.  8 c). Stratigraphically, the tuffs conformably contact the volcanic rocks and volcaniclastic rocks (Fig.  2 b, c), which are interlayered with the volcanic agglomerate, volcanic breccia, tuffaceous sandstone, and basalt (Fig.  4 f–i). Therefore, {{the age of the}} tuff can represent the depositional age of the volcaniclastic rock, and further constrains the age of basalt, i.e., the basalt was also erupted during the Late Carboniferous.|$|R

The Mikkel structure is not filled to its spill point and it is possible that hydrocarbons might have leaked from the reservoir to the overburden rocks. Therefore this study was initiated to search for any possible indications of vertical hydrocarbon leakages in the area. All types of available data were utilized to analyze the seismic anomalies identified in the area. To map the possible seismic indications above the Mikkel structure, three <b>key</b> <b>horizons</b> and major and some minor faults in the overburden strata were interpreted. Seismic attribute maps were created in the interpreted intervals to highlight any possible seismic indications of leakage in the area. AVO and Petrophysical analyses were performed to determine the lithology and the type of anomalies observed in the study area. Mud gas analyses were carried out to find out any possible gasindications in the seismic deteriorated zones. After careful investigations, two zones of seismic amplitude dimming/brightening and a high amplitude anomaly were identified. The dimmed zones originated above BCU and terminated in the shallower levels. The high amplitude anomaly was observed and analyzed at the top of Tare Formation. The AVO analyses indicated similar response at the observed high amplitude anomaly and in the hydrocarbon filled Ile Formation. Seismic attribute maps were made to map these anomalies. These maps supported the earlier observations made on seismic sections. The observations showed that leakage might have occurred through the reactivated faults or fracture systems and other reason may be through pore network. The results from this study will help in focusing the discussion around suitable areas for CO 2 storage. </p...|$|R

The Ling Depression is studied and analyzed to extract information leading to the geological evolution {{of the study area}}. The data of regional seismic lines along with borehole information was assembled and used for the structural and stratigraphic analysis. Mapping of the <b>key</b> <b>horizons</b> was performed and time-structure maps along with time-thickness maps were generated. Further onwards, detailed analyses on different fault geometries and style of faulting were carried out. These exercises facilitated in extracting in-depth details of the key structural elements and finally comprehend the geological evolution of the Ling Depression and the adjacent highs. Horst geometries are interpreted which are bounded by deep-rooted brittle faults, probably linking with a major Devonian basement shear zone, the Hardangerfjord Shear Zone. Some clear rotated half-grabens are observed below the Base Zechstein within the Ling Depression. Large salt diapirs breaching into the Mesozoic-Cenozoic stratigraphy mostly in the SW of the study area are also noticed. Large-scale monoclinal fold structures are interpreted at the shallower stratigraphic level in the study area. The primary depo-centers are determined using the time-thickness maps between the certain stratigraphic levels. In the light of the obtained results, it is assumed that the basement shear zones of the Early Devonian age have {{played an important role in}} shaping the local geometries and features in the study area. Major half-grabens observed are confined to the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian rifting event along with the reactivation of certain deep-rooted fault geometries.

40|$|Acquisition of {{high quality}} 2 D seismic data by the New Zealand Government in 2009 - 10 (the PEG 09 Survey) sparked new {{interest}} in Pegasus Basin, an offshore frontier basin situated east of central New Zealand. Although no wells have been drilled in Pegasus Basin, strata exposed onshore in southern Wairarapa and northeastern Marlborough provide useful analogues for the sedimentary fill of the basin. Using field observations in combination with petrographic analysis and seismic interpretation, this study provides a more complete understanding of the geology of Pegasus Basin. 13 outcrop localities are described from the surrounding southern Wairarapa and northern Marlborough regions, which are inferred to have been deposited {{in a range of}} depositional environments including fluvial, terrestrial and shallow marine deposits, through to inner – mid shelf, and deep marine channel-levee and submarine fans, with fine-grained sedimentation at bathyal depths. These outcrops provide representative and well-exposed examples of facies and lithologies typical of the depositional environments that are likely to exist in Pegasus Basin. Petrographic analysis of six Cretaceous and six Neogene sandstones from Marlborough and Wairarapa regions has revealed that they are compositionally classified as litharenites and feldspathic litharenites, derived from the Torlesse Supergroup. Primary porosity is best preserved in Neogene sandstones, whilst Cretaceous sandstones only tend to preserve secondary porosity, in the form of fractures or dissolution of framework grains. Carbonate cementation, compaction and authigenic clay formation are the biggest contributing factors that degrade reservoir quality. Seismic interpretation of the PEG 09 survey has revealed that Pegasus Basin contains a sedimentary succession over 10, 000 m thick, that mantles Early Cretaceous syn-tectonic strata in various states of deformation attained during mid-Cretaceous subduction at the eastern Gondwana margin. <b>Key</b> <b>horizons</b> mapped extensively over the basin highlight seismic reflection packages, which are linked to described outcrop localities onshore, based on reflection characteristics and geometries. The Miocene succession contains up to 4, 000 m of sediments that are likely to include promising reservoir lithologies akin to the Great Marlborough Conglomerate of Marlborough, or the Whakataki Formation of Wairarapa...|$|R

40|$|The Kaparelli Fault was {{activated}} {{during the}} 1981 Gulf of Corinth earthquake sequence, producing extensive ground deforma-tion. The {{main purpose of}} this work was to identify and date previ-ous Late Quaternary faulting events and to resolve slip on the main trace of the Kaparelli normal fault prior the 1981 seismic event by means of paleoseismological trenching. The identification of paleo-seismic events {{is based on the}} recognition of colluvial deposits, fissure fills and displacements of <b>key</b> stratigraphic <b>horizons.</b> The three excavated trenches exposed evidence of at least three events in the past 10. 000 years, prior to the 1981 earthquake sequence. The two most recent events were identified in two of the trenches. Calibrated radiocarbon age distributions are used directly from organic-rich soil horizons in order to estimate the recurrence interval of past seismic events. Radiocarbon dating results from two of the trenches constrain the timing of the recognized faulting events, based on colluvial sedimentation and fissure fills, from 9490...|$|R
40|$|In the Porcupine Seabight, {{along the}} North-Atlantic Continental Margin, a {{province}} of mostly buried mound structures was found (500 – 750 m water depth) {{by means of}} high-resolution 2 D seismic profiles taken the last few years. Comparison with similar seabed structures in the area allows their identification as coral banks, associated {{with the growth of}} deepsea-coral species such as Lophelia sp. and Madrepora sp.. To allow a more detailed study of morphology and spatial patterns of the mounds, a unique opportunity was offered by Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Ltd., and its partners Arco, Conoco and Dana: the upper 400 ms of a 830 km 2 industrial 3 D seismic data block in the area were made available to the RCMG for scientific research. Morphological <b>key</b> <b>horizons</b> were interpreted and mapped, and several of these were entered in a GIS for integrated study and interpretation. Mound morphologies were mapped automatically, together with the associated moats, and possible spatial trends were derived. A large swarm of mounds was found, with densities of 1 /km 2, even up to 1. 4 /km 2 and heights up to 100 m. All mounds seem to originate from the same reflection, hence forming a mound ‘event’ in time and space. Morphologies range from round, conical single mounds to multiple, ridgelike and complex structures. The biggest structures are found on {{the western edge of the}} region under investigation; mounds here sometimes come up to the seabed. The smallest ones occur on the eastern side and seem to be buried much quicker by a much thicker sediment package. Most morphologies are elongated in the N/S direction, indicating a N/S (paleo) current activity. Hence both currents and sediment patterns clearly have influenced the mound growth dynamics and environment. The western edge of the mound swarm also coincides geographically with the upslope border of a slump feature deeper in the geological section. At the downslope – eastern – side however the coincidence is non-existent. Hence, the possible role of the deeper lying slope failure is not clear yet. 3 D seismics clearly forms an ideal tool to study morphologies and spatial patterns and relationships of local phenomena in the geological record, such as the mound structures in the Porcupine Seabight...|$|R

A 3 D {{view of the}} amplitude-colored seismic horizons (blue, {{green and}} red curves in Figure 6) that are {{extracted}} using (a) one control point, (b) 25 control points, and (c) 25 control points with refinement using our active-surface method. Horizons and sequence boundaries are important geologically significant sur-faces that can be extracted from seismic images. Many automatic methods {{have been developed to}} extract horizons, but these methods usually have diffi-culty extracting horizons that terminate at angular unconformities or sequence boundaries. Using sequence boundaries as constraints is one way to solve this problem, but there exists no automatic method for sequence-boundary extrac-tion. We first introduce a globally optimal method to efficiently extract a horizon from a seismic image. We then use scattered control points as constraints to en-able our horizon-extraction method to extract sequence boundaries. Finally, we propose an active-surface method to refine the globally optimized horizons to align with amplitude peaks or troughs and thereby reveal more geologic details. <b>Key</b> words: <b>horizon</b> sequence boundary control point active surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparison}} of palaeoclimate records {{on their own}} independent timescales {{is central to the}} work of the INTIMATE (INTegrating Ice core, MArine and TErrestrial records) network. For the North Atlantic region, an event stratigraphy has been established from the high-precision Greenland ice-core records and the integrated GICC 05 chronology. This stratotype provides a palaeoclimate signal to which the timing and nature of palaeoenvironmental change recorded in marine and terrestrial archives can be compared. To facilitate this wider comparison, without assuming synchroneity of climatic change/proxy response, INTIMATE has also focussed on the development of tools to achieve this. In particular the use of time-parallel marker horizons e. g. tephra layers (volcanic ash). Coupled with the recent temporal extension of the Greenland stratotype, as part of this special issue, we present an updated INTIMATE event stratigraphy highlighting <b>key</b> tephra <b>horizons</b> used for correlation across Europe and the North Atlantic. We discuss the advantages of such an approach, and the key challenges for the further integration of terrestrial palaeoenvironmental records with those from ice cores and the marine realm...|$|R
40|$|A {{proliferation}} of 3 D geological models {{has been created}} by the British Geological Survey (BGS) over the last 15 years, following significant developments in software, hardware and modelling methodology. Modelling of the subsurface by the BGS has been widespread, ranging in depth from 1 m to 15000 m, and covering areas in the orders of 0. 1 km 2 to 100 km 2. These models have been produced to increase {{our understanding of the}} subsurface environment and to help us communicate issues pertaining to it, such as geological hazards, water protection and resource management. For these reasons, particular focus has been drawn to the major urban areas of the UK such as the Lower Mersey Corridor (Liverpool to Manchester), the Clyde basin (Glasgow and surrounding region) and Thames basin (London and surrounding region). This has {{led to the development of}} a number of overlapping models in these regions and, since these models have been created for specific purposes and at varying scales, there has been little consideration given to ensuring that the individual geological surfaces within them are consistent from one model to another. Methodology has now been developed through the Thames Basin Cross- Cutting Project to amalgamate multiple versions of individual geological surfaces taken from existing 3 D models, some of them overlapping, into a series of unified surfaces that represent the preferred geological interpretation at any given set of coordinates. The methodology alleviates some of the issues that have arisen with the existing models, such as different scales of overlapping surfaces (expressed as cell or mesh size), and the use of different subsets of the available records (boreholes/seismic reflection profiles/geological maps), commonly with different interpretations. This methodology has been tested on four <b>key</b> <b>horizons</b> within the Thames basin catchment area which are the stratigraphic tops and bases of the Lambeth Group and Chalk Group. The unified surfaces will provide a consistent representation of the subsurface for use by other modelling disciplines, including groundwater science. They will contribute to a whole-systems approach to climate change research, structural modelling, process modelling and palaeoclimate studies. They will also provide a starting point for future geological modelling that takes account of the work already done for existing 3 D models, rather than one that goes back to the original data...|$|R
