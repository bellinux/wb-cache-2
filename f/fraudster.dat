5|$|The 1981 BBC comedy drama Private Schulz, about a German <b>fraudster</b> {{and petty}} criminal's unwilling World War II {{service in the}} SS, {{prominently}} features the salon. In the first episode, Schultz has been given the job of manning a listening post in the brothel's basement and recording the conversations {{picked up by the}} hidden microphones.|$|E
5|$|Klemana Schuetz was {{identified}} as the bomber by Franz Mayhoff, a New York anarchist and <b>fraudster,</b> who claimed in an affidavit that Schuetz had once admitted throwing the Haymarket bomb. August Wagener, Mayhoff's attorney, sent a telegram from New York to defense attorney Captain William Black {{the day before the}} executions claiming knowledge of the bomber's identity. Black tried to delay the execution with this telegram but Governor Oglesby refused. It was later learned that Schuetz was the primary witness against Mayhoff at his trial for insurance fraud, so Mayhoff's affidavit has never been regarded as credible by historians.|$|E

50|$|In staged {{collision}} fraud, <b>fraudsters</b> use a {{motor vehicle}} to stage an accident with the innocent party. Typically, the fraudsters' vehicle carries four or five passengers. Its driver makes an unexpected manoeuvre, forcing an innocent party to collide with the <b>fraudster's</b> vehicle. Each of the <b>fraudsters</b> then files claims for injuries sustained in the vehicle. A “recruited” doctor diagnoses whiplash or other soft-tissue injuries which are hard to dispute later.|$|R
25|$|Dummy {{corporations}} may {{be created}} by <b>fraudsters</b> {{to create the illusion}} of being an existing corporation with a similar name. <b>Fraudsters</b> then sell securities in the dummy corporation by misleading the investor into thinking that they are buying shares in the real corporation.|$|R
5|$|Walsh {{became a}} {{football}} agent {{for a short}} time, and represented Lee Bradbury during his move to Manchester City. He also invested in property and other businesses, though lost money by investing in Australian <b>fraudster</b> Peter Foster. Walsh began working in the media after retiring as a player, and first began working as a pundit on Sky Sports in 2001, and since that time has appeared regularly on Soccer Saturday and Football First. He has also worked as an after dinner speaker. In December 2007, he led a campaign against speeding fines in Hampshire.|$|E

25|$|One of Aventinus' sources was Officina (1503), an {{encyclopedia}} compiled by French scholar Jean Tixier de Ravisi. This work purported that Tuisto and Gambrivius were giants descended from Noah. But Jean Tixier had only catalogued and reported a conjecture {{made in the}} name of the Hellenistic-era historian Berossus, by the <b>fraudster</b> Annio da Viterbo (1498), who had previously used the same hypothesis to postulate an ancestry for the Gauls.|$|E
25|$|One of Key's {{responsibilities}} was {{to ensure}} {{a steady supply of}} building material for the building of public housing. In 1948 he made the acquaintance of <b>fraudster</b> Sidney Stanley and was consequently summoned to appear before the Lynskey Tribunal investigating corruption among Ministers. No accusation against him was substantiated. When the two Poplar constituencies were combined into one at the 1950 general election, Key was selected there and comfortably elected; however, he left the government immediately afterwards on grounds of age.|$|E

25|$|In 18 February, {{the local}} White Army staff met in Pieksämäki where they made final {{plans for the}} coming second attack. The White unit was {{composed}} of 1,000 men from the Savonia, Kymenlaakso and Ostrobothnia regions. It was commanded by the general Ernst Löfström with the junior officers C. W. Malm and Johan Sainio and the Austrian corporal Karl Müller as his subcommanders. The corporal Müller was a <b>fraudster</b> who had enlisted the White Army claiming to be the German lieutenant Karl von Zedtwitz zu Hackenbach. In reality, he was a corporal of the German infantry {{who had been a}} prisoner of war in Russia. On his way back home, Müller decided to join the Finnish Whites with a false identity.|$|E
25|$|The West Indies {{regional}} teams {{competed in}} what was named the Stanford 20/20 tournament. The event was financially backed by convicted <b>fraudster</b> Allen Stanford, who gave at least US$28,000,000 funding money, the fruit of his massive Ponzi scheme. It was intended that the tournament would be an annual event. Guyana won the inaugural event, defeating Trinidad and Tobago by 5 wickets, securing US$1,000,000 in prize money. A spin-off tournament, the Stanford Super Series, was held in October 2008 between Middlesex and Trinidad and Tobago, the respective winners of the English and Caribbean Twenty20 competitions, and a Stanford Superstars team formed from West Indies domestic players; Trinidad and Tobago won the competition, securing US$280,000 prize money. On 1 November, the Stanford Superstars played England {{in what was}} expected to be the first of five fixtures in as many years with the winner claiming a US$20,000,000 in each match.|$|E
25|$|In June 2009, it was {{announced}} that County were in talks on a takeover by Munto Finance, a Middle Eastern consortium owned by Qadbak Investments and represented by Nathan and Peter Willett. Speculated by the British media and supported in part by various press releases, the club were believed to be given multimillion-pound backing and were linked during the takeover's initial planning stages with the Qatari royal family by British tabloids; however, the latter claim was denied by the family. The supporters' trust, which owned the majority 60% share in the club, voted in favour of the takeover. On 14 July 2009, the takeover was confirmed, with Peter Trembling being appointed as executive chairman. A week later former England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson {{was announced}} as the club's new director of football, having been persuaded by convicted <b>fraudster</b> Russell King to join Notts County. On 28 July 2009, the club unveiled a new logo.|$|E

25|$|Heseltine and Labovitch also {{founded the}} {{magazine}} publishing company Cornmarket, {{and brought out}} Directory of Opportunities for School Leavers and Directory of Opportunities for Qualified Men, which earned a steady income from advertising. Canadian, French and German versions were also launched, although these were less profitable. In late 1959, using £10,000 of a £30,000 profit on selling a freehold site off Regents Park, they acquired the famous (but unprofitable) magazine Man About Town whose title was shortened to About Town then simply Town. In 1962, they paid £10,000 for Topic, a weekly newspaper which had been launched in 1961 {{by a group of}} entrepreneurs including the Prime Minister's son Maurice Macmillan, and which was now owned by Norman Mascall (a pyramid scheme <b>fraudster</b> of the era). By then the economic climate was too difficult, and like many publishers they found that there is limited appetite for weekly papers in the UK. Topic ceased publication at the end of 1962, but its journalists later became The Sunday Times Insight Team.|$|E
500|$|In 1872, Congress {{created the}} crime of mail fraud. Rev. Stat. § 3929 {{authorized}} the United States Postmaster General, [...] "upon evidence satisfactory to him" [...] that mail fraud was being committed, to instruct the post master at the fraudster's local post office to return registered mail addressed to the <b>fraudster</b> to the sender with the word [...] "Fraudulent" [...] written or stamped on the envelope. In 1895, this authority was extended to all mail. Further, Rev. Stat. § 4041 authorized the Postmaster to also bar suspected fraudsters from cashing postal money orders.|$|E
500|$|On 16 July 1936, an Irish <b>fraudster</b> called Jerome Bannigan, alias George Andrew McMahon, {{produced}} a loaded revolver as Edward rode on horseback at Constitution Hill, near Buckingham Palace. Police spotted {{the gun and}} pounced on him; he was quickly arrested. At Bannigan's trial, he alleged that [...] "a foreign power" [...] had approached him to kill Edward, that he had informed MI5 of the plan, {{and that he was}} merely seeing the plan through to help MI5 catch the real culprits. The court rejected the claims and sent him to jail for a year for [...] "intent to alarm". It is now thought that Bannigan had indeed been in contact with MI5, but the veracity of the remainder of his claims remains open.|$|E
5000|$|Dummy {{corporations}} may {{be created}} by <b>fraudsters</b> {{to create the illusion}} of being an existing corporation with a similar name. Similar to the [...] "pump and dump" [...] scheme, <b>Fraudsters</b> mislead investors in order to sell securities in the dummy corporation, in this case, making investors incorrectly believe [...] "that they are buying shares in the real corporation". The sale of securities through a fraudulent corporation is inherently illegal.|$|R

Despite his sceptism Lei Xuan pretends to have powers of his own to combat the <b>fraudsters,</b> who seem to have genuine powers. After a battle of wits Lei Xuan exposes the <b>fraudsters</b> for what they are and that the majority of their so-called magical powers are tricks, however even when exposed the <b>fraudsters</b> continue to claim that some of their powers are real and derive from a magical treatise.|$|R

500|$|On June 1, 1995, Abu-Jamal's {{death warrant}} {{was signed by}} Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge. Its {{execution}} was suspended while Abu-Jamal pursued state post-conviction review. At the post-conviction review hearings, new witnesses were called. William [...] "Dales" [...] Singletary testified that he saw the shooting and that the gunman was the passenger in Cook's car. Singletary's account contained discrepancies which rendered it [...] "not credible" [...] {{in the opinion of}} the court. William Harmon, a convicted <b>fraudster,</b> testified that Faulkner's murderer fled in a car that pulled up to the crime scene, and could not have been Abu-Jamal. Robert Harkins testified that he had witnessed a man stand over Faulkner as the latter lay wounded on the ground, who shot him point-blank in the face and then [...] "walked {{and sat down on the}} curb".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Park Lane {{moved away from}} prestigious houses in the early 20th century, as residents began to complain about motor traffic and the noises from buses. The first flats were built on Nos.139–140 in 1915 despite local opposition, with shops following soon after. However, buildings were redeveloped to allow penthouse flats, which became popular. The politician and art collector Philip Sassoon lived at No.25 in the 1920s and 30s and held an extensive collection of objects at his house. Dancing partners Fred and Adele Astaire moved into a penthouse flat at No.41 in 1923, and stayed there during their theatrical appearances at London's West End. The couple were courted by the social scene in London and enjoyed dancing at Grosvenor House. The black market <b>fraudster</b> Sidney Stanley lived on Park Lane in the 1940s, and became known as [...] "the Pole of Park Lane".|$|E
500|$|Writing for The New Republic, Russian-American {{journalist}} Julia Ioffe {{commented that}} {{by arguing that}} Samutsevich was innocent because she had not participated, Khrunova's defense had implied that Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina had in fact committed a crime, and had cut off [...] "the one path to redemption that the group actually had: ignoring the court’s proceedings and denying its legitimacy". Some commentators saw Samutsevich's unexpected release as a divide and rule tactic {{on the part of}} the authorities. Details later emerged of an alleged Nasedka ("mother hen"), a prisoner who spies on fellow inmates and manipulates them into co-operating with the authorities in return for privileges and early parole. A convicted <b>fraudster</b> named Irina Orlova was placed in the same cell as Samutsevich, where she apparently gained her trust and persuaded her to change lawyers. Any alleged agreement with authorities would have required Samutsevich to publicly denounce her former lawyers.|$|E
