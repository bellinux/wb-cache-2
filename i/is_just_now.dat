500|$|Auditions for {{the lead}} role of Sarah began in England in April 1984. Helena Bonham Carter auditioned for the role, but it was {{ultimately}} {{decided it would be}} better to cast an American actress. Monthly auditions were held in the U.S. until January 1985, and Jane Krakowski, Yasmine Bleeth, Sarah Jessica Parker, Marisa Tomei, Laura Dern, Ally Sheedy, Maddie Corman, and Mia Sara all auditioned for the role. Of these, Krakowski, Sheedy and Corman were considered to be the top candidates. 14-year-old actress Jennifer Connelly was ultimately chosen to play Sarah after her audition on January 29, 1985, [...] "won Jim [...] over" [...] and led him to cast her within a week. According to Henson, Connelly was chosen as she [...] "could act that kind of dawn-twilight time between childhood and womanhood." [...] Connelly moved to England in February 1985 in advance of the film's rehearsals, which began in March. Discussing her understanding of her role with Elle, Connelly said that the film is about [...] "a young girl growing out of her childhood, who <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>now</b> becoming aware of the responsibilities that come with growing up." ...|$|E

This is the time of all others when Democracy should prove its purity and its spiritual power to prevail. It is surely the manifest destiny of the United States to lead in the attempt to make this spirit prevail.|$|E
