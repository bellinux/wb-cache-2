5|$|In November 2008, Porter Airlines, which flies between Midway and Toronto, Canada, was {{the only}} <b>international</b> <b>route</b> served from Chicago–Midway after ATA Airlines, which had flights to Mexico, ceased {{operations}} in April that year.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1979, {{the number}} of Grønlandsfly {{passengers}} served annually exceeded 60,000, more than the population of Greenland. That year, the airline's first <b>international</b> <b>route</b> was also opened, running between Greenland's capital Nuuk {{and the town of}} Iqaluit in northern Canada. The route connected Greenland's Kalaallit with Canada's Inuit and was operated in conjunction with the Canadian First Air line, but the planes were generally run empty and the route was shuttered 13 years later.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{the company}} {{won the first}} public service {{obligation}} tender that was issued by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Starting 1August, Teddy Air started serving Fagernes Airport, Leirin, with routes to Oslo and Bergen. The contract gave a subsidy of NOK23.7 million for three years, and was 15 percent lower than what Coast Air had been receiving. On 20May 1997, Teddy Air started its first <b>international</b> <b>route,</b> from Stavanger to Gothenburg in Sweden.|$|E
50|$|With Singapore Airlines {{determined}} {{to develop its}} <b>international</b> <b>routes,</b> it took the entire fleet of seven Boeing 707s and five Boeing 737s which would allow it to continue servicing the regional and long-haul <b>international</b> <b>routes.</b> Since most of MSA's <b>international</b> <b>routes</b> were flown out of Singapore, {{the vast majority of}} <b>international</b> <b>routes</b> were in the hands of Singapore Airlines. In addition, MSA's headquarters, which was located in Singapore, became the headquarters of Singapore Airlines.|$|R

25|$|The differing {{needs of}} the two shareholders, however, led to the {{break-up}} of the airline just 6 years later. The Singapore government preferred to develop the airline's <b>international</b> <b>routes,</b> while the Malaysian government {{had no choice but}} to develop the domestic network first before going regional and eventually international. MSA ceased operations in 1972, with its assets split between two new airlines; Malaysian Airline System (MAS), and Singapore Airlines. With the Singapore government determined to develop its airlines' <b>international</b> <b>routes,</b> it took the entire fleet of seven Boeing 707s and five Boeing 737s, which would allow it to continue servicing its regional and long-haul <b>international</b> <b>routes.</b> Since most of MSA's <b>international</b> <b>routes</b> were flown out of Singapore, the majority of <b>international</b> <b>routes</b> were in the hands of Singapore Airlines.

5|$|Sandakan Airport (SA) (ICAO Code : WBKS) {{provides}} flights {{linking the}} town to other domestic destinations. To boost the twin town relationship with Zamboanga City and for the ASEAN spirit in the BIMP-EAGA region, there is an <b>international</b> <b>route</b> from Sandakan to Zamboanga International Airport. Local destinations for the airport including Kota Kinabalu, Kuching, Kuala Lumpur and many others. It {{is also one of}} the destinations for MASWings, which serves flights to other smaller towns or rural areas in East Malaysia. As of 2014, the airport is being upgraded and expanded to accommodate additional travellers.|$|E
5|$|While the 747-100 {{powered by}} Pratt & Whitney JT9D-3A engines offered enough payload and range for US {{domestic}} operations, it was marginal for long <b>international</b> <b>route</b> sectors. The demand for longer range aircraft with increased payload quickly {{led to the}} improved -200, which featured more powerful engines, increased MTOW, and greater range than the -100. A few early -200s retained the three-window configuration of the -100 on the upper deck, but most were built with a ten-window configuration on each side. The 747-200 was produced in passenger (-200B), freighter (-200F), convertible (-200C), and combi (-200M) versions.|$|E
5|$|Braathens SAFE's {{domestic}} market was deregulated on 1 April 1994. Since then, any airline within the European Economic Area {{is free to}} operate any domestic or <b>international</b> <b>route.</b> Braathens rejected a proposal from the main competitor Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) for a merger; instead the helicopter division was sold and the company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. New routes were opened from Oslo Airport, Fornebu to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø, but the routes from Bergen to these cities were terminated. International routes to Rome, Nice and Jersey were introduced. In 1996, Braathens SAFE bought Sweden's second-largest airline, Transwede, and started flying on the Oslo–Stockholm route. The following year, Transwede, with its five domestic routes, was merged into Braathens SAFE. The same year, KLM bought 30% of Braathens SAFE and the airlines started a partnership.|$|E

5|$|The {{originally}} proposed route {{would have}} taken the torch through Taipei after leaving Vietnam and before heading for Hong Kong. However, the government of Taiwan (then led by the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party) objected to this proposal, claiming that this route would make {{the portion of the}} relay in Taiwan appear {{to be part of the}} torch's domestic journey through China, rather than a leg on the <b>international</b> <b>route.</b> This dispute, as well as Chinese demands that the flag and the national anthem of the Republic of China be banned along the route led the government of Taiwan to reject the proposal that it be part of the relay route, and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait subsequently blamed each other for injecting politics into the event.|$|E

25|$|DNL {{was granted}} a ten-year {{monopoly}} on all domestic flights on 5 April 1935. This initially consisted of a sea plane route from Oslo along the coast to Tromsø and an <b>international</b> <b>route</b> from Oslo via Kristiansand to Amsterdam. DNL received NOK200,000 in state grants, plus NOK100,000 from Norway Post, {{for the first year}} of operation. Services commenced on 7 June with a wet leased Ju 52 from Luft Hansa on the <b>international</b> <b>route.</b> The domestic routes were flown using Junkers W 34. It bought a new ferry, MB Teist.
