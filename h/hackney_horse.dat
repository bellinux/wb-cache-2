5|$|Native ponies {{existed in}} Wales before 1600 BC, and a Welsh-type cob {{was known as}} early as the Middle Ages. They were {{influenced}} by the Arabian horse, and possibly also by the Thoroughbred and the <b>Hackney</b> <b>horse.</b> In 1901, the first stud book for the Welsh breeds was established in the United Kingdom, and in 1907 another registry was established in the United States. Interest in the breed declined during the Great Depression, but revived in the 1950s. Throughout their history, the Welsh breeds have had many uses, including as a cavalry horse, a pit pony, and as a working animal on farms.|$|E
5|$|The Morgan {{horse is}} one of the {{earliest}} horse breeds developed in the United States. Tracing back to the foundation sire Figure, later named Justin Morgan after his best-known owner, Morgans served many roles in 19th-century American history, being used as coach horses and for harness racing, as general riding animals, and as cavalry horses during the American Civil War {{on both sides of the}} conflict. Morgans have influenced other major American breeds, including the American Quarter Horse, Tennessee Walking Horse and the Standardbred. During the 19th and 20th centuries, they were exported to other countries, including England, where a Morgan stallion influenced the breeding of the <b>Hackney</b> <b>horse.</b> In 1907, the US Department of Agriculture established the US Morgan Horse Farm near Middlebury, Vermont for the purpose of perpetuating and improving the Morgan breed; the farm was later transferred to the University of Vermont. The first breed registry was established in 1909, and since then many organizations in the US, Europe and Oceania have developed. There were estimated to be over 175,000 Morgan horses worldwide in 2005.|$|E
50|$|The Hackney pony is a {{breed of}} pony {{closely related to}} the <b>Hackney</b> <b>horse.</b> Originally bred to pull carriages, they are used today {{primarily}} as show ponies. The breed does not have its own stud book, but shares one with the <b>Hackney</b> <b>horse</b> in all countries that have an official Hackney Stud Book Registry.|$|E
50|$|Shoo Shoo and Hoo Hoo, {{bought in}} 1906, were <b>hackney</b> <b>horses.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>Hackney</b> <b>Horse's</b> height {{ranges from}} 14.2 hands (147 centimetres) to 16.2 hands (168 cm) tall. They may be any solid colour, {{including}} bay, brown, chestnut and black. Hackneys often have white markings, often {{due to the}} influence of sabino genetics.|$|R
50|$|In 1883, the <b>Hackney</b> <b>Horse</b> Society {{was formed}} in Norwich and the society’s stud book has records dating back to 1755 in the Hackney Stud Book.|$|E
50|$|Robert and Philip Ramsdale, {{father and}} son, took the Norfolk horses Wroot's Pretender and Phenomenon to Yorkshire, where they bred them with Yorkshire {{trotting}} mares. In July 1800, the celebrated Hackney mare, Phenomenon, was backed to trot 17 miles in 56 {{minutes for a}} bet of £400, which she did in 53 minutes. In 1832, one of Phenomenon's daughters, the 14 hands Phenomena, trotted 17 miles in only 53 minutes. During the 19th century, with {{the expansion of the}} railway, the Norfolk breed fell out of favour, to be revived later by the <b>Hackney</b> <b>Horse</b> Society. The Norfolk and Yorkshire Trotter were selectively bred for elegant style and speed, and were developed into the modern <b>Hackney</b> <b>Horse.</b> The brilliant gaits of the <b>Hackney</b> <b>Horse,</b> however, saved it from extinction, and began its use in the show ring. They are still extremely successful in harness, and can also produce very nice riding horses, many known for their ability in show jumping and dressage competition.|$|E
50|$|By 1539, Antoine {{suffered}} from gout and asked his niece, Mary of Guise, {{to send him}} a Scottish <b>hackney</b> <b>horse</b> which he hoped to find easier to ride with his condition.|$|E
50|$|Ponies {{are popular}} driving {{animals in the}} UK and Welsh ponies and cobs have a special aptitude, {{intelligence}} and presence in all driving disciplines. <b>Hackney</b> <b>horses</b> and part-breds are popular, too, as their extravagant action combined with athleticism and stamina enables them to star in every phase of the competition.|$|R
50|$|Hackneys come in both pony {{and horse}} height ranges, and {{are one of}} the few breeds that {{recognize}} both pony and <b>horse</b> sizes. The <b>Hackney</b> Pony was developed in the late 19th century, when <b>Hackney</b> <b>horses</b> were bred to various pony breeds in order to create a very specific type of show pony.|$|R
5|$|The {{brother of}} the Lord High Admiral, Dudley served in the royal navy and {{commanded}} the new royal ship Swallow in 1545. In March 1546, he went on his first diplomatic mission to the Regent of Flanders.

50|$|Fine harness {{is a type}} {{of driving}} {{competition}} seen at horse shows, that feature light, refined horses with high action. Popular breeds in this event include the American Saddlebred, Morgan, Arabian, Dutch Harness Horse, and <b>Hackney</b> (<b>horse).</b>|$|E
5000|$|A Norfolk Trotter stallion, Bellfounder was {{imported}} to America in 1822, and {{he proved}} {{a major influence}} in {{the founding of the}} Standardbred by becoming the damsire of Hambletonian 10. Norfolk Trotters also strongly influenced today's modern <b>Hackney</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|E
50|$|Alexander Cassatt was {{responsible}} for the introduction of the Hackney Pony to the United States. In 1878 he acquired 239 Stella in Britain and brought her to Philadelphia.

5000|$|In legal jargon, Hobson's Choice {{is known}} to barristers as the [...] "Cab-rank rule"; the gentleman's {{agreement}} that a barrister take a client who is first in line, whether the barrister likes it or not. This may come from Hobson's choice of renting out <b>hackney</b> <b>horses</b> strictly by rote (long before {{the creation of the}} London Hackney Carriages Act 1843).|$|R
50|$|James sent Don Martin and Garcia back to Spain {{with two}} Scottish {{ambassador}}s, two fine <b>hackney</b> <b>horses,</b> five large swift dogs for hunting wild boar, and a goshawk {{said to be}} able to catch cranes and buzzards. There was already a veteran ambassador in London, Dr Rodrigo Gonzalez (or Gundisalvi) de Puebla, who had worked on the Treaty of Woking in 1490. This alliance between Spain and England was a ratification of the Treaty of Medina del Campo, to be sealed by the marriage of Catherine of Aragon to Arthur, Prince of Wales.|$|R
5|$|The Morgan {{trotting}} stallion Shepherd F. Knapp was {{exported to}} England in the 1860s, where his trotting ability influenced the breeding of <b>Hackney</b> <b>horses.</b> During this period, numerous Morgan mares {{may have been}} brought west and integrated into Texan horse herds, which influenced {{the development of the}} American Quarter Horse breed. The Morgan horse also was an ancestor of the Missouri Fox Trotter. By the 1870s, however, longer-legged horses came into fashion, and Morgan horses were crossed with those of other breeds. This resulted in the virtual disappearance of the original style Morgan, although a few remained in isolated areas.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} terms {{are used in}} the {{industry}} to describe legal and illegal transportation providers. Hacks or Hackers is a common term that originated with the <b>hackney</b> <b>horse,</b> a breed of horse typically offered for hire in the 19th century. Other terms used are livery cab, car service, or jitney cab.|$|E
50|$|In about 1729 a Norfolk Trotter {{stallion}} and an Arabian stallion {{contributed to}} the foundation stock for the modern <b>Hackney</b> <b>Horse.</b> The resulting Norfolk Roadster, as it was known, was a heavily built horse that {{was used as a}} work horse by farmers and others. It was also a fast horse with good stamina.|$|E
5000|$|The Hackney pony may not {{be above}} [...] and usually range between 12 and 14 hh. It should have true pony characteristics, {{and should not be}} a scaled down version of the <b>Hackney</b> <b>Horse.</b> The pony should have a small pony head, carried high, with alert and pricked ears and large, {{intelligent}} eyes. The neck should be muscular, arched, and carried proudly. Hackney ponies should have powerful shoulders, a compact back, and a light frame. The legs are strong with good joints, but the bone is usually fine. The feet are very hard, and are usually allowed to grow long in the toe to accentuate the action of the pony. The tail is often set and is carried high. They usually have even more exaggerated action than the <b>Hackney</b> <b>horse,</b> knees rising as high as possible and hocks coming right under the body. The action should be fluid, spectacular, and energetic.|$|E
2500|$|Morse {{was born}} on October 20, 1900, in the Madison, Wisconsin, home of his {{maternal}} grandparents, Myron and Flora White. Morse's parents, Wilbur F. Morse and Jessie Elnora Morse, farmed a [...] plot near Verona, a small community [...] west-southwest of Madison. Morse grew up on this farm, where the family raised Devon cattle for beef, Percheron and <b>Hackney</b> <b>horses,</b> dairy cows, hogs, sheep, poultry, and feed crops for the animals. The family eventually included five children: Mabel, seven years older than Morse; twin brothers Harry and Grant, four years older; Morse; and Caryl, fourteen years younger.|$|R

50|$|Hawson’s company {{expanded}} and the Timor ponies {{were moved to}} his new lease at the Coffin Bay Run in 1847. Here they were bred in a semi-wild, yet controlled manner in the new stud, Coffin Bay Run. In 1857 Coffin Bay Run was sold to W.R. Mortlock who instead of investing in the pure Timor ponies, imported larger horses and ponies, which he crossed with the semi-wild Timor ponies to produce larger stock. Mortlock used approved stallions of the Welsh Cob, Thoroughbred and Arabian Horse breeds in the herd. He also used Clydesdale and <b>Hackney</b> <b>horses</b> who may have had influence on the Coffin Bay Ponies.|$|R
5000|$|The {{balance of}} the shoe can alter action: the three-gaited American Saddlebred and the <b>Hackney</b> <b>Horse</b> have the highest knee action, while the Tennessee Walking Horse is asked to perform the [...] "big lick," [...] exaggerated action of the front legs, {{especially}} in the running walk, where the horse both lifts its feet very high and reaches them out in front as far as possible.|$|E
5000|$|Colman was an {{enthusiastic}} breeder and exhibitor of harness horses and dogs. He {{was president of}} the National Horse Association of Great Britain from 1939 - 1945; and of the <b>Hackney</b> <b>Horse</b> Society in 1923 and 1938, and chairman of the British Horse Society from 1952 [...] - 1955. The latter society awarded him its medal of honour in 1953. He was also a committee member of the Kennel Club.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to flat-racing his Thoroughbreds, in 1895 A. J. Cassatt {{helped found the}} National Steeplechase Association to organize competitive steeplechase racing. He was also responsible for {{the introduction of the}} Hackney pony to the United States. In 1878 he acquired 239 Stella in Britain and brought her to Philadelphia.

The organization and registry continues to this day with its headquarters now in Lexington, Kentucky.|$|E
50|$|Massachusetts {{native and}} Harvard {{graduate}} John Endicott came to Detroit in 1891, becoming head bookkeeper of Newcomb's enterprise. He was “admitted {{as a member}} of the firm” in 1896 and became treasurer when Newcomb-Endicott was incorporated as a department store in 1903. He was married twice, first to Elizabeth Watson, who died, and then in 1902 to Mary Elizabeth Booth and had three children. His other endeavors included being director of the Michigan State Agricultural Society, and owner of a large stock farm near Birmingham where he bred <b>Hackney</b> <b>horses.</b> Newcomb-Endicott Co. was Michigan's first department store, founded in 1868, predating the J.L.

50|$|This farm {{is shown}} on Pont's / Blaeu's 1654 map {{and it is}} close to the River Annick (previously Annock or Annack Water) in the area once known as Strathannick. The name may refer to the {{appearance}} of the long strips of land which were typical of the 'rig and furrow' ploughing system. Langlands Farm overlooks the confluence of the Annick and the Glazert at Water Meetings; two high-arched bridges provide the road crossing. Langlands was owned at one time by the Sword family who ran the Western SMT Bus Company in the mid-20th century. They had a large collection of <b>Hackney</b> <b>horses</b> with an exercise track and other facilities at Langlands (Smith 2006). A rare example of a pear tree grows near the farm.|$|R
25|$|Godfrey {{was born}} in Manhattan in 1903. His mother, Kathryn Morton Godfrey, was from a well-to-do Oswego, New York, family which disapproved of her {{marriage}} to an older Englishman, Arthur's father Arthur Hanbury Godfrey. The senior Godfrey was a sportswriter and considered an expert on surrey and <b>hackney</b> <b>horses,</b> but {{the advent of the}} automobile devastated the family's finances. By 1915, when Arthur was 12, the family had moved to Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. Arthur, the eldest of five children, tried to help them survive by working before and after school, but at age 14 left home to ease the financial burden on the family. By 15 he was a civilian typist at Camp Merritt, New Jersey, and enlisted in the Navy (by lying about his age) two years later.|$|R
5000|$|Hambletonian 10 is {{considered}} a foundation sire of the Standardbred due to his pervasive influence on modern bloodlines. However, the breed is older than Hambletonian by a few generations and was formed by mixing Thoroughbred bloodlines with various trotting breeds such as the Norfolk Trotter, Canadian Pacer and <b>Hackney</b> <b>horse.</b> Hambletonian's sire Abdallah, {{one of the fastest}} trotters of his time, was sired by the Thoroughbred stallion Mambrino and was out of the Norfolk Trotter mare Amazzona.|$|E
50|$|In 1924, {{her mother}} {{purchased}} the Why Worry Farm in Woodside for Lurline, where she bred horses. She owned a five-gaited horse, a three-gaited horse, a Standardbred road horse, a <b>Hackney</b> <b>horse,</b> a Hackney pony and a jumper and hired a trainer, thus {{turning it into}} a show stable. After she stopped competing, her horses won many equestrian awards. Two of her best-known American Saddlebred horses were Chief of Longview (born at Longview Farm in Lee's Summit, Missouri) and Sweetheart on Parade.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} a breed formed by {{foundation}} stock from other breeds, but not necessarily all from named individual animals, is the <b>Hackney</b> <b>horse,</b> with bloodlines contributed from Thoroughbred and Norfolk Trotter. In other cases, where a breed or landrace is older than any written records, the foundation bloodstock is sometimes described by myths or legends, such as the mythical horses of Mohammad, known as Al Khamsa ('The Five'), {{said to be the}} foundation mares of the Arabian horse breed.|$|E
50|$|Archibald Bell Jr {{was shown}} the route across the Blue Mountains from Richmond to Mount Tomah, {{known as the}} Bell's Line of Road, in 1823 by Darug men Emery and Cogy.
