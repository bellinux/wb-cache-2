5|$|Lower Princes Street rises {{slightly}} from the Exchange before dropping down, becoming <b>flat</b> <b>for</b> the final kilometre of its length. Here, there {{is a mix of}} commercial, wholesale, and light industrial properties, with only occasional retail shops. The street itself widens from thee crest below the Exchange, becoming a dual carriageway from this point south to the major junction {{at the southern end of}} the Oval. Several notable buildings are still found in the lower Princes Street area, among them the former H.E. Shacklock building and the Crown Roller Mills Building; the latter in particular is a notable landmark.|$|E
5|$|According to Kaga, upon release Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light {{received}} extensive {{criticism from}} Japanese publications, with many noting {{that it was}} difficult to understand and had fairly poor graphics, awarding it low scores. In contrast, popular opinion was more positive: in a poll taken by Family Computer Magazine, the game scored 23.48 points out of 30. Likewise, sales of the game were <b>flat</b> <b>for</b> the first two months of sales, but improved after word of mouth had spread. According to Kaga, a notable journalistic writer devoted a Famitsu column to the game, and this prompted sales to pick up around half a year after release. As of 2002, Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light had sold 329,087 units, being the third best-selling title in the series to that date.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) was a German Renaissance {{printmaker}} {{who made}} important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement), meant {{to teach the}} subjects of linear perspective, geometry in architecture, Platonic solids, and regular polygons. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of Luca Pacioli and Piero della Francesca during his trips to Italy. While the examples of perspective in Underweysung der Messung are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of polyhedral nets, polyhedra unfolded to lie <b>flat</b> <b>for</b> printing. Dürer published another influential book on human proportions called Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion) in 1528.|$|E

5|$|An era {{came to an}} end in 1668 {{with two}} events: Davenant died suddenly, leaving a messy {{ownership}} situation for the Duke's Company, and Pepys' eyesight forced him to stop keeping a diary. Thomas Betterton, though formally a minority shareholder, continued to run the Duke's Company, and, in the spirit of Davenant, commissioned the most elaborate of the Restoration playhouses, the theatre at Dorset Garden (or Dorset Gardens), with a <b>flat</b> <b>for</b> himself on top. Although the Dorset Garden Theatre quickly became a famous and glamorous venue, very little is concretely known about the building and outfitting of it: a vague and undocumented tradition ascribes its design to Christopher Wren. The absence of Pepys' record means that performance data for the next decades are only patchily known.|$|E

Paracetamol (aka acetaminophen) or other simple analgesics can be used to ease soreness, which is common for 2–3 days after the procedure. Any worsening pain, redness, fever, bleeding or swelling may suggest a complication.

The top of the fell is relatively <b>flat</b> <b>for</b> a distance of about 2.5 kilometres (1.6 miles) in a north-to-south direction and the impressive Eel Crags fall away vertically on the Newlands side of the fell, these crags are popular with rock climbers with the quality of the rock being very good. High Spy North Top stands almost a kilometre north of the main top it has a height of 634 metres (2080feet) and is also classed as a Nuttall, it gives a fine view of Derwent Water. 600 metres (650 yards) north of the main summit is a small unnamed tarn.|$|E
25|$|The Odysseus crater is now quite <b>flat</b> <b>for</b> {{its size}} of {{approximately}} 450km or more precisely, its floor conforms to Tethys' spherical shape. This {{is most likely}} due to the viscous relaxation of the Tethyan icy crust over geologic time. The floor lies approximately 3km below the mean radius, while its exterior rim is about 5km above the mean radius—the relief of 6–9km is not very high for such a large crater. Inside the crater the rim is composed of arcuate scarps and extends for about 100km until the floor is reached. There are several graben radiating away from Odysseus, which are 10–20km wide and hundreds of kilometers long. They {{are likely to be}} cracks in the crust created by the impact. The most prominent among them is called Ogygia Chasma.|$|E
25|$|The {{historic}} shophouses {{could easily}} be re-used for modern businesses, such as restaurants, cafes, bars and small shops. The interior of the buildings could be modified with the new use in mind, in some cases using new non-traditional interior ornamentation, materials, and colours. For instance, {{the interior of the}} Opera Cafe at No. 40 Boat Quay was modified to create an ambiance similar to an opera stage-set. The ground floor of the Lim Family Shophouse at No. 58 Boat Quay was converted into a Japanese restaurant. The upper floor is used as a weekend <b>flat</b> <b>for</b> the Lim family, who lived in the building since 1908. The architect Mok Wei Wei created more open space by demolishing some of the original partition walls, but kept and restored the original teak floors, paint colour on the window frames, wooden balcony doors, and tile roofs. The historic blackwood furniture and art pieces were also restored and re-used.|$|E

25|$|In January 2009, George {{was sentenced}} to 15 months in prison for falsely imprisoning a male escort (Auden Carlsen) by handcuffing him to a wall and beating him with a metal chain. The incident, which {{happened}} in April 2007, stemmed from George's belief that Carlsen had attempted to hack into his computer while he was visiting George's <b>flat</b> <b>for</b> a nude photo session. After being released from prison, George resumed his DJ career embarking on a worldwide tour of clubs. He played a special residency at the Shaw Theatre in London from 23 January 2008, followed by a full UK tour. In April 2008, The Biography Channel featured a documentary {{on the life of}} Boy George. The American tour which was planned for July/August 2008 had to be cancelled because he had been denied a United States visa due to the pending London court case scheduled for November 2008. On 2 July six concert dates in South America were announced. Boy George participated in RETROFEST held in Scotland in August 2008, and a 30-date UK tour took place in October/November 2008.|$|E
25|$|Evert {{decided that}} 1989 {{was to be}} her final year on tour; she made three finals at the {{beginning}} of the year (taking Graf to three sets in the Virginia Slims of Florida). She pulled out of the clay court season after a few uncharacteristic losses. She also withdrew from the Wimbledon warm-up with an inner-ear infection that made her doubtful for Wimbledon. At the 1989 Wimbledon Championships, Evert lost out in the semifinals to Graf with a scoreline of 2–6, 1–6. The last slam singles event Evert played in was the 1989 US Open; her fourth-round match with Monica Seles was a highlight. It was a well anticipated match because of her loss to Seles on clay in the final of Houston (in the spring). She showed all the characteristics that made her a great champion, defeating Seles, 6–0, 6–2. She was <b>flat</b> <b>for</b> her quarterfinal with Zina Garrison and lost by a score of 6–7(1–7), 2–6. She said after the match that it highlighted the reason she was retiring.|$|E
25|$|The two men {{returned}} to Bradley's flat, where Ireland {{suggested that he}} tie Bradley up; Bradley expressed his displeasure at the idea. In order to get Bradley to comply, Ireland {{told him that he}} was unable to perform sexually without elements of bondage. Bradley hesitantly cooperated and was soon trussed up on his own bed, face down, with a noose around his neck. After Ireland had secured Bradley, he demanded money and a PIN number under the threat of torture. Ireland assured Bradley that he was merely a thief and would leave after stealing Bradley's money. After Bradley gave Ireland his PIN, which Ireland later used to steal £200, along with £100 in cash stolen from Bradley's flat, Ireland told him that he should go to sleep, as he wouldn't be leaving his <b>flat</b> <b>for</b> hours. Bradley eventually did fall asleep and Ireland momentarily thought of leaving Bradley unharmed. Ireland then realised that Bradley could identify him and used the noose, which he had earlier attached around Bradley's neck, to strangle him. Before leaving Bradley's flat, he placed a doll on top of the dead man's body.|$|E

25|$|Kat {{begins to}} have second {{thoughts}} about the divorce after Pam Coker (Lin Blakley) gives a speech about love and family. Stacey reveals to Alfie that their rent is increasing and Kat is struggling with money. Alfie then invites Kat to his <b>flat</b> <b>for</b> lunch and they reminisce about their relationship. The next day, Kat lashes out at Alfie for leaving leftovers for the children, but {{at the urging of}} Stacey, she agrees to be his date to Ian and Jane's wedding if he makes more effort for making up for the fire. On the wedding day, she gets heavily drunk, and during the reception, shoves Sonia Fowler's (Natalie Cassidy) head into the wedding cake. When the nursery raise their rates, Kat is forced to leave the children in Mo's care to work her shift at the market, but ends up having drinks with Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson). When Mo brings the children over to the pub, they misbehave and Kat is thrown out of the pub. Undeterred, Kat and Kim continue drinking and sneak into the pub to steal another bottle of wine. Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), catches them, and while Kim leaves to find the cash to pay for it, Linda prepares to call social services to tell them of Kat's irresponsibility as a mother, but Kat snatches Linda's phone and throws it across the ground. When Kim returns with Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), she confesses her fears about being a bad mother, resulting in the other three women sharing their experiences of motherhood and reassuring her. Kat also tells Linda to speak to Mick about her fears that the baby may not be his. Linda then realises that the phone call was still connected, and promises to fix things to make sure social services do not know about what happened, however Kat receives a call from a social worker requesting to visit her. Kat is surprised when a lawyer visits her about Harry telling her about a compensation case with four other women also raped by Harry.|$|E
