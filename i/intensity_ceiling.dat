40|$|Infrapopulation {{growth and}} {{resource}} utilization of two cohabitant, viviparous gyrodactylid monogeneans, namely Gyrodactylus rysavyi Ergens, 1973 andMacrogyrodactylus congolensis (Prudhoe, 1957) Yamaguti, 1963 {{from the skin}} and fins of the Nile catfish Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822), were studied under natural and experimental conditions. Field data revealed that either monogenean species attained low infrapopulation growth, where the threshold or <b>ceiling</b> <b>intensity</b> on a medium-sized catfish (total length= 30 ± 2 cm) was 30 worms for the large-sized M. congolensis and 300 worms for the comparatively small-sized G. rysavyi. On naturally infested catfish, the ceiling densities for M. congolensis and G. rysavyi were 0. 08 worms/cm 2 and one worm/cm 2, respectively. Under laboratory conditions, each monogenean species exhibited an exponential infrapopulation growth and microhabitat expansion over vacant sites of attachment during monospecific infestation. The threshold or <b>ceiling</b> <b>intensity</b> on a medium-sized catfish was approximately 300 worms for M. congolensis and up to 25000 worms for G. rysavyi. The ceiling densities for M. congolensis and G. rysavyi were 0. 8 worms/cm 2 and 100 worms/cm 2, respectively. The present monospecific infestation experiments revealed that G. rysavyi is highly proliferating than M. congolensis. Surprisingly, few Gyrodactylus worms registered at the initial phase were found to multiply rapidly, giving birth up to 25000 worms at the terminal phase of the infestation course, within approximately 5 weeks. On the other hand, during experimental mixed infestation, G. rysavyi proliferated more rapidly and outnumbered M. congolensis. Factors promoting gyrodactylid infrapopulation proliferation and those inducing infrapopulation crash are discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the dust {{distribution in the}} crescent disk around HD 142527 based on the continuum emission at 890 μ m obtained by ALMA Cycle 0. The map is divided into 18 azimuthal sectors, and the radial intensity profile in each sector is reproduced with a 2 D disk model. Our model takes account of scattering and inclination of the disk {{as well as the}} azimuthal dependence in intensity. When the dust is assumed to have the conventional composition and maximum size of 1 mm, the northwestern region (PA= 329 ^∘- 29 ^∘) cannot be reproduced. This is because the model intensity gets insensitive to the increase in surface density due to heavy self-scattering, reaching its ceiling much lower than the observed <b>intensity.</b> The <b>ceiling</b> depends on the position angle. When the scattering opacity is reduced by a factor of 10, the intensity distribution is reproduced successfully in all the sectors including those in the northwestern region. The best fit model parameters depend little on the scattering opacity in the southern region where the disk is optically thin. The contrast of dust surface density along PA is derived to be about 40, much smaller than the value for the cases of conventional opacities (70 - 130). These results strongly suggest that the albedo is lower than considered by some reasons at least in the northwestern region. Comment: 27 pages (single column), 9 figures.

40|$|The Borg 6 – 20 {{rating of}} {{perceived}} exertion (RPE) scale {{is a common}} measure reported during exercise testing and training, and is usually taken as a response measurement to provide a subjective assessment of exercise intensity. A lesser used application of the scale is for regulating exercise intensity, referred to as its ‘production mode’. Recent research on this topic initiated by Eston et al. (2005) {{has led to a}} novel application of this procedure as a means of predicting an individual’s maximal oxygen uptake (O 2 max) via a perceptually-regulated exercise test (PRET). The PRET could {{play a significant role in}} guiding exercise prescription and monitoring cardiorespiratory fitness levels in situations where the normal heart rate response is affected. The aim of this thesis is to develop further and test the integrity of the PRET technique. Firstly, a review of the evidence on the validity and reliability of the Borg RPE scale when used to regulate exercise intensity in healthy and unhealthy adults is presented, as to-date, no scholarly publication has synthesised the body of knowledge on this specific application of the scale. Subsequently, four studies were completed to investigate the effects of different methodological variations on the predictive capabilities of the PRET, including an examination (for the first time) of its utility among heart failure patients (Study 4). Study 1 re-visited the validity and reliability of the PRET technique utilising a modified protocol of differing durations (2 and 4 min bouts), with revised instructions and placing the graded exercise test (GXT) as the final trial during cycle ergometry. Superior results were observed to those reported in previous investigations (Eston et al., 2008; Faulkner et al. 2007; Eston et al., 2006) during the 3 min trial, further reinforcing the validity and reliability of this technique. Accordingly, Study 2 was the first to investigate the reliability and validity of a treadmill PRET protocol with a <b>ceiling</b> <b>intensity</b> of RPE 15, rather than RPE 17, and observed that a safer modified PRET (with practice) provides acceptably valid and reliable predictions of O 2 max in healthy adults. In addition, Study 3 extended the research thus far by investigating the PRET protocol during cycle exercise, once again with a <b>ceiling</b> <b>intensity</b> of RPE 15, and demonstrated that (with practice) a cycle-based PRET can yield reliable and valid predictions of O 2 max that compare favourably to previous investigations. Finally, given that the research employing a PRET has unanimously alluded to its likely value in clinical populations among whom heart rate as a physiological response to exercise is affected (e. g. via medication) and precluded as a means predicting O 2 max, Study 4 investigated the utility of a PRET in a beta-blocked population of heart failure patients. In the event, it was observed that a PRET (up to RPE 15) was too strenuous and needs to be capped at an intensity of RPE 13 in this population. In addition a continuous protocol seemed unsuitable due to its length and it was recommended that a discontinuous PRET protocol be investigated. Future research needs to investigate the utilisation of the PRET (i) in different exercise modes; (ii) determine the optimum number of practice trials required; (iii) whether a discontinuous or continuous protocol is more appropariate; (iv) whether the extrapolation should be made to RPE 19 or 20 and; (v) whether the PRET can be employed succesfully in other clinical populations...|$|R
