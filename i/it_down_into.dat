5|$|The {{most widely}} known anecdote about Archimedes tells {{of how he}} invented a method for {{determining}} the volume of an object with an irregular shape. According to Vitruvius, a votive crown for a temple had been made for King Hiero II of Syracuse, who had supplied the pure gold to be used, and Archimedes was asked to determine whether some silver had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith. Archimedes had {{to solve the problem}} without damaging the crown, so he could not melt <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its density.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, some strains of O. oeni {{were shown to}} use {{acetaldehyde}} by breaking <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> ethanol or acetic acid. While this may help for wines with excessive levels of acetaldehyde, for red wines, it can also destabilize {{the color of the}} wine by interfering with acetaldehyde's reaction with anthocyanins to create polymeric pigments that help create a wine's color.|$|E
25|$|In a {{previous}} section only a simple harmonic force {{was applied to}} the model, but this can be extended considerably using two powerful mathematical tools. The first is the Fourier transform that takes a signal as a function of time (time domain) and breaks <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> its harmonic components as a function of frequency (frequency domain). For example, by applying a force to the massndash&springndash&damper model that repeats the following cycle – a force equal to 1nbsp&newton for 0.5nbsp&second and then no force for 0.5nbsp&second. This type of force has the shape of a 1nbsp&Hz square wave.|$|E

25|$|Like other volcanoes {{around the}} Pacific Ocean, Mayon {{is a part}} of the Pacific Ring of Fire. It is on the {{southeast}} side of Luzon, close to the Philippine Trench, which is the convergent boundary where the Philippine Sea Plate is driven under the Philippine Mobile Belt. When a continental plate meets an oceanic plate, the lighter and thicker continental material overrides the thinner and heavier oceanic plate, forcing <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> the Earth's mantle and melting it. Superheated magma and gases may be forced through weaknesses in the continental crust caused by the subduction of the oceanic plate, and one such exit point is Mayon.|$|E

500|$|Architectural experts {{sometimes}} {{differ in}} their interpretations of Kahn's design. [...] Why, for example, are the cross beams at the clerestory windows above the atrium so massive? Carter Wiseman says, [...] "While they appear to be—and indeed are—structural, they are far deeper than necessary; their no-less-important role was to diffuse the sunlight {{coming in from the}} surrounding clerestory windows and reflect <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> the atrium." [...] Sarah Goldhagen thinks there is more to the story, asserting that [...] "the concrete X-shaped cross below the skylit ceiling at the Exeter Library is grossly exaggerated for dramatic effect." [...] Kathleen James-Chakraborty goes even further: [...] "Above, in the most sublime gesture of all, floats a concrete cross brace, illuminated by clerestory windows. [...] Its weight, which appears ready to come crashing down upon the onlooker, revives the sense of threat dissipated elsewhere by the reassuring familiarity of the brick skin and wood details." [...] Kahn similarly floated a massive concrete structure above the sanctuary of the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, which he designed a few years earlier.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Graziano and Velton Ray Bunch {{composed}} original {{music for}} the series. Composed by Randy Edelman, the distinctive theme music gained recognition beyond the show's following; in the mid-1990s, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) hired Edelman to provide music for its sports coverage, including National Football League games and the Olympics. The music samples Edelman sent NBC included the Brisco theme, and by 1996 it was being used during coverage of the Olympics. NBC used it again as the theme for their coverage of the 1997 World Series. Edelman said, [...] "It was original, {{and it seemed to}} have the right spirit. It's got a very flowing melody, it's triumphant, and it has a certain warmth. And it has at the end of it, what all television things like this have, a 'button', an ending flourish that works really well if they need to chop <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> a 15-second thing." [...] Cary Darling said that the [...] "booming" [...] theme song was [...] "part Magnificent Seven, part Aaron Copland and as grand and wide as 'Big Sky Country'".|$|E
500|$|Price called Sunset Overdrive {{the biggest}} game the studio had worked on. As {{it was the}} first open world game {{developed}} by Insomniac they had to deploy new design and development skills to produce it. The time and resources needed to develop the game also expanded significantly. While developing the game's world, the team broke <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> 10 to 11 hexes and zones. They are classified into three different types: low resolution zones, shadow zones, and mission zones, and they overlap each other so that they can keep all zones loaded at the same time. Sunset City had three different iterations. In the early stages, it was called Greenlight City, based on Burbank, California. This version of the city featured interior structures that could be explored by players, and existed when the game's core concept revolved around [...] "scavenge, craft, defend". This city was replaced with [...] "Razor City" [...] when skateboarding, which later became oil slicks and trampolines, was introduced to the game. Razor City was [...] "Neo-Tokyo"-styled, but was later replaced by Sunset City which was more organized. While designing the game's artificial intelligence, the team thought that the game's enemies must force players to use the traversal system while simultaneously engaging in combat with them. Because of the game's vertical design, the enemies were designed to adopt the game's vertical map-design. The team also developed a “nav position tracker”, which programmed these enemies to detect the location of players and find an ambush point.|$|E

500|$|As the Japanese {{advanced}} in the South West Pacific during early 1942, the RAAF hurriedly established three new fighter units for Australia's northern defence, Nos.75, 76 and 77 Squadrons. Arthur was posted to No. 76 Squadron in April, flying P-40 Kittyhawks in New Guinea. His brother Norman {{was killed in}} action on 9 November 1942 while serving with the 2/31st Infantry Battalion in Papua. Promoted to squadron leader, in February 1943 Wilf succeeded Les Jackson as commanding officer of No.75 Squadron, based at Milne Bay {{under the control of}} No.9 Operational Group RAAF. [...] Arthur developed a reputation for diligence, courtesy, and concern for the welfare of his men. Despite the fact that, at 23, he was the youngest officer in his new squadron, he commanded the respect of his fellows because, he believed, [...] "they like that I work hard; they like that I am not frightened of anything (i.e. Pretends not to be) and above those, they like that I don't boast". Having shot down a Mitsubishi G4M [...] "Betty" [...] bomber on 10March, Arthur was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his [...] "gallantry, matchless leadership and devotion to duty" [...] on 14April 1943. On this occasion, in spite of his guns jamming, he led 34 Allied aircraft, including Kittyhawks of Nos.75 and 77Squadrons and P-38 Lightnings of the USAAF, in [...] "a determined head-on attack" [...] to intercept 100 Japanese raiders, 14 of which were destroyed by the defenders. Arthur described the situation of being in combat but unable to shoot as [...] "sort of awkward. Fortunately nobody else would know except me." [...] To compensate for his lack of offensive weaponry, he repeatedly made as though attempting to ram one of the raiders, to try and force <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>into</b> the sea.|$|E

The next time the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed solution, thereby saving computation time {{at the expense of}} a (hopefully) modest expenditure in storage space. (Each of the subproblem solutions is indexed in some way, typically based on the values of its input parameters, so as to facilitate its lookup.) The technique of storing solutions to subproblems instead of recomputing them is called [...] "memoization".|$|E
