5|$|On November 6, 1905, Maeda was {{reported}} visiting professional wrestler Akitaro Ono in Asheville, North Carolina; after this, Maeda {{was no longer}} routinely associated with Tomita in the US newspapers. On December 18, 1905, Maeda was in Atlanta, Georgia, for a professional wrestling match with Sam Marburger. The contest was best of three, two falls with <b>jackets</b> <b>and</b> one without, and Maeda won the two with <b>jackets</b> <b>and</b> lost the one without. According to the Atlanta papers, Maeda listed his residence as the YMCA in Selma, Alabama.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{new engine}} was plagued with problems, such as {{failure of the}} {{accessory}} gear trains and coolant <b>jackets,</b> <b>and</b> several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set. Early production Merlins were also unreliable: Common problems were cylinder head cracking, coolant leaks, and excessive wear to the camshafts and crankshaft main bearings.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{eventually}} became popular in other European countries as well. Pugs were painted by Goya in Spain, and in Italy they rode up front on private carriages, dressed in <b>jackets</b> <b>and</b> pantaloons that matched {{those of the}} coachman. They were used by the military to track animals and people, and were also employed as guard dogs.|$|E

5|$|After {{being drafted}} by the Blue Jackets, Filatov signed a three-year {{contract}} with the club on July 10, 2008. His base salary for the contract was $875,000, with bonus clauses that could bring the value as high as $1.35million per season. His signing with Columbus created some controversy within the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), however, as League President Alexander Medvedev claimed that the Blue Jackets owed CSKA Moscow compensation of at least $1.5million for signing Filatov. Medvedev claimed that although the term of the contract had expired, under Russian law it did not terminate until an indemnity amount had been negotiated. The Blue <b>Jackets</b> <b>and</b> Filatov believed that giving his club 30 days notice was sufficient to terminate the contract. CSKA threatened to withhold Filatov's transfer card, thus impeding his ability to play in another league, but Filatov, his lawyers and the Blue Jackets believed they had followed the necessary tenets of Russian law. Filatov's contract was one of six reviewed by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) {{in an attempt to}} mediate the disputes between the KHL and NHL. During this investigation, the players were unable to play international hockey sanctioned by the IIHF. In September, the KHL dropped its opposition to Filatov's contract with the Blue <b>Jackets,</b> <b>and</b> he received his transfer.|$|E
5|$|As an {{homage to}} the venue, the stage was {{decorated}} with roses. The multi-leveled set-up consisted of New York City fire escape routes. Other parts of the stage had a ladder reaching the mezzanine floors and a replica of an F train carriage. Gaga's wardrobe was also rose themed, with leotards, hats and <b>jackets,</b> <b>and</b> instruments adorned with red roses. The main set list for the residency encompassed songs from The Fame, The Fame Monster, Born This Way, and Artpop. Some tracks were performed in acoustic versions.|$|E
5|$|On 20 July 1982, in the Hyde Park and Regents Park bombings, {{two devices}} {{linked to the}} Provisional Irish Republican Army caused the death of eight members of the Household Cavalry and the Royal Green <b>Jackets</b> <b>and</b> seven horses.

5|$|The 2006 Dr Pepper ACC Championship Game {{featured}} the Georgia Tech Yellow <b>Jackets</b> <b>and</b> the Wake Forest Demon Deacons in a regular-season American football game {{to determine the}} champion of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Wake Forest defeated Georgia Tech by a 96 score to win its first ACC football championship since 1970 and its second in school history. The game was held at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium (now known as EverBank Field) in Jacksonville, Florida and was the concluding game {{of the regular season}} for each team.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 ACC Championship Game was {{a college}} {{football}} game between the Georgia Tech Yellow <b>Jackets</b> <b>and</b> the Clemson Tigers. The game, sponsored by Dr. Pepper, was the final regular-season contest of the 2009 college football season for the Atlantic Coast Conference. Georgia Tech defeated Clemson, winning the Atlantic Coast Conference football championship, 39–34. However, Georgia Tech was forced to vacate the game victory and the conference title in 2011 due to sanctions stemming from an NCAA investigation.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{also participated}} in the first {{integrated}} bowl game in the Deep South. The 1956 Sugar Bowl featured the 7th ranked Georgia Tech Yellow <b>Jackets,</b> <b>and</b> the 11th ranked Pitt Panthers. There was controversy over whether Bobby Grier from Pitt {{should be allowed to}} play because he was black, and whether Georgia Tech should even play at all due to Georgia governor Marvin Griffin's opposition to integration. Ultimately, Bobby Grier played which made the game the first integrated Sugar Bowl and the first integrated bowl game in the Deep South.|$|E

5|$|The team's struggles {{continued}} into December, where the Flames lost four of six games {{to begin the}} month. Back-to-back victories over the Columbus Blue <b>Jackets</b> <b>and</b> Toronto Maple Leafs on December 13 and 16, respectively, {{marked the first time}} the team won consecutive games since late October. The latter victory also spoiled Dion Phaneuf's first return to Calgary following his trade to Toronto the previous season. The Flames followed the victories with three consecutive losses, but entered the Christmas break on a positive note with a 3–2 shootout victory over the Dallas Stars.|$|E
5|$|Arab and Islamic {{influences}} strongly mark Antemoro culture. Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing {{included a}} turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes {{similar to those}} worn in {{many other parts of}} the Muslim world. Harefo reeds were woven to form mats (tafitsihy) that were sewn together to form <b>jackets</b> <b>and</b> tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of fanto (beaten barkcloth) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn over one shoulder. Adolescent and adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats, as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with whom they were forbidden to marry.|$|E
5|$|González-Gordon {{has been}} {{described}} as being proud of his Scottish heritage, which centred on the town of Huntly and the Clan Gordon. His personal clothing style reflected this; he was noted for his tweed <b>jackets</b> <b>and</b> British clothes in general. He had been married to Milagro López de Carrizosa y Eizaguirre for 62 years before she died in July 2013. The couple had two children, Bibiana and Mauricio, with Mauricio being the current president of the family company. During the three final years of his life González-Gordon was in poor health and could hardly leave his home. He died on 27 September 2013 in his hometown of Jerez de la Frontera at the age of 89. His family claims that the last thing he drank was a Tío Pepe, the most famous brand of the family business. His death occurred at the Asisa clinic where he had spent his last couple of weeks. The memorial service was held at the San Juan Bautista de La Salle church on 28 September.|$|E

5|$|Red foxes {{are among}} the most {{important}} furbearing animals harvested by the fur trade. Their pelts are used for trimmings, scarfs, muffs, <b>jackets</b> <b>and</b> coats. They are principally used as trimming for both cloth coats and fur garments, including evening wraps. The pelts of silver-morph foxes are popular as capes, while cross foxes are mostly used for scarves and rarely for trimming. The number of sold fox scarves exceeds the total number of scarves made from other furbearers. However, this amount is overshadowed {{by the total number of}} fox pelts used for trimming purposes. The silver morphs are the most valued by furriers, followed by the cross and red morphs respectively.> In the early 1900s, over 1,000 American fox skins were imported to Britain annually, while 500,000 were exported annually from Germany and Russia. The total worldwide trade of wild red foxes in 1985–86 was 1,543,995 pelts. Foxes amounted to 45% of US wild-caught pelts worth $50million. Pelt prices are increasing, with 2012 North American wholesale auction prices averaging $39, and 2013 prices averaging $65.78.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{entered the}} 2005 season having won the 2004ACC Championship, {{the last to}} be awarded without playing a {{championship}} game {{at the end of}} the season. Tech won its first eight games and appeared to be on course to have an untroubled run to the ACC Championship Game. But against the fifth-ranked Miami Hurricanes, Tech suffered its first defeat of the season, losing 277 on November 5. Because each team had one ACC loss (Miami had previously lost to Florida State) and the Hurricanes had the tie-breaking head-to-head win, Miami had the lead in the Coastal Division. But Miami later lost a second ACC game to the Georgia Tech Yellow <b>Jackets,</b> <b>and</b> the Hurricanes were knocked out of contention for the Coastal Division title in favor of the Hokies, who lost only to Miami.|$|E
5|$|For the 2013–14 season, the League re-aligned and Ottawa {{was moved}} to the new Atlantic Division {{along with the rest of}} the old Northeast Division and the Columbus Blue <b>Jackets</b> <b>and</b> Detroit Red Wings from the Western Conference. The re-alignment {{increased}} the competition to qualify for the playoffs, as there was now 16 teams in the East fighting for eight playoff spots. There were changes on the club as well. Ottawa entered the season with Jason Spezza as the team's new captain as long-time captain Daniel Alfredsson left to join the Detroit Red Wings after a contract dispute with the club. The same day that Alfredsson signed, the club swung a deal for Anaheim Ducks' scorer Bobby Ryan. There were numerous other changes to the lineup as well. The club signed free agents Clarke MacArthur and Joe Corvo, while not re-signing veteran defencemen Sergei Gonchar and Andre Benoit. While MacArthur had a career season, Ryan played well until he was injured, and Corvo lost his place in the lineup. The club struggled on defence, with shots and goals against increasing from the previous season. The club was a sub-.500 team much of the season, or only a few games above and never was in a playoff position all season. At the NHL trade deadline, Murray traded for flashy right winger Ales Hemsky from Edmonton and he played well, establishing chemistry on a line alongside Jason Spezza and Milan Michalek, though the club was eliminated from playoff contention in the last week of the season.|$|E
