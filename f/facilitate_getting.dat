40|$|The present chapter {{discusses}} the self-regulation of goal pursuit. Research on goal pursuit has commonly focused on two separate issues: {{the setting of}} appropriate goals and the effective striving for goal attainment (Gollwitzer & Moskowitz, 1996; Oettingen & Gollwitzer, 2001). Research on goal setting observed that mentally contrasting a desired future outcome with obstacles of present reality leads to goal commitments to reach this outcome in line with one’s expectations of success (Oettingen, 2000). Given that expectancies of success are high, strong goal commitments emerge as reflected in cognitive, affective, and behavioral indicators. Research on goal striving observed that spelling out goal implementation in advance by simple if-then plans linking an instrumental goal-directed behavior (then-component) to anticipated situational cues (if-component) manages to automate goal striving, thus <b>facilitating</b> <b>getting</b> started on one’s goals and shielding them from disruptions (Gollwitzer, 1993, 1999).

If this oil were able to reach [...] "tidewater" [...] for export using oil tankers, it would presumably command a higher price (see: Brent Crude benchmark). Several pipelines have been proposed to bring the oil to [...] "tidewater", including the Keystone XL project (via the Gulf of Mexico), the Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines project (via the British Columbia coast), the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline project (via the Beaufort Sea), or the Energy East pipeline project (via the Bay of Fundy).

40|$|Abstract Background In {{this study}} a new {{instrument}} and technique is described for the endoscopic treatment of complete posterior urethral strictures, which {{may result in}} serious complications and sometimes require troublesome treatments.

Evrim Bougie looks like a Guyon Bougie, has a curved end, which <b>facilitates</b> <b>getting</b> into the bladder through the cystostomy tract and with a built in channel of 1. 5 mm in diameter for a sliding needle exiting at its tip. Having confirmed fluoroscopically and endoscopically that the sliding needle had passed across the strictured segment, the strictured segment was incised with internal urethrotomy, distal to the strictured segment, and urethral continuity was accomplished. At {{the end of the}} operation a Foley urethral catheter was easily placed into the bladder per urethra. Patients were instructed in self-catheterization after removal of the urethral catheter. All patients achieved normal voiding at postoperative 7 th month follow-up evaluation. Conclusion Internal urethrotomy could be performed under the guidance of the sliding needle of Evrim Bougie advanced from above the posterior urethral strictures, which to our knowledge was described {{for the first time in}} the English literature.
