5000|$|SEIU’s {{policy of}} {{developing}} partnerships with its employers {{is a major}} point of contention for the internal reform movement. Unions often seek neutrality agreements with employers to preempt union busting efforts and to facilitate the card check process of winning union recognition. SEIU has significantly expanded these neutrality agreements to include concessions {{on the ability to}} strike and publicly criticize companies. Some deals have traded organizing rights in one location—often determined by the employer—for contract concessions to management in other bargaining units or for guarantees to delay organizing at other sites. To date, SEIU has made agreements with several U.S-based and multinational companies including, Kaiser Permanente, Tenet Healthcare, Sodexho, and the U.S unit of Compass Group PLC based in London. SMART and other critics have argued that by prohibiting strikes and public relations tactics these deals often take away the union’s key tools for winning wage and benefit gains at the bargaining table. Without picket lines or the use of a public corporate campaign—which enlists community, religious, and political allies in an effort to pressure employers to recognize unions or make contract concessions—methods for worker and community mobilization are often limited. In some cases, SEIU has participated in legislative lobbying efforts with or on behalf of companies as part of corporate partnerships. In Washington state, SEIU Local 775 joined Eagle Healthcare and five other nursing home companies to form “Washington United for Quality Nursing Home Care” to lobby for increased state funding for private nursing homes. These lobbying efforts could secure funds needed to help pay Local 775 members working in nursing homes. However, the 10-year agreement outlining this labor-management alliance empowers nursing home chains to unilaterally designate select homes for organizing drives (and keep others non-union) and bars strikes as well as “negative rhetoric” against management. Additionally, a portion of any state funds the alliance receives is designated for business and property tax reimbursements for the nursing home companies—corporate tax breaks which will not be shared with Local 775 members. In 2003, forming a similar alliance with nursing homes in California, SEIU expanded its joint lobbying efforts into the arena of tort and health care reform. According to a copy of the confidential agreement establishing the “California Alliance” leaked to SF Weekly, SEIU planned to lobby on behalf of nursing home companies for increased state subsidies and limits on patient neglect or malpractice lawsuits. SEIU also promised to oppose any new safe staffing regulations or legislation. As in Washington state, the California agreement enabled SEIU locals including UHW and the United Long-Term Care Workers, Local 6434 to organize unopposed in specific nursing homes. In return, union members gave up their right to strike. “Template agreements” establishing guidelines for wages, benefits, and working conditions also preempted substantive contract negotiations. According to a subsequent 2007 assessment of the “California Alliance” written by UHW, “ workers…found themselves with ‘template’ contracts that allowed for very little power on the shop floor with no right to strike and no clear path toward <b>full</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining rights.” [...] (Upon expiration of the “California Alliance” in 2007, SEIU opted not to renew the labor-management deal.) [...] Supporters of employer agreements argue that they are a necessary organizing innovation in the face of decreasing rates of unionization in the past few decades. During labor’s hey-day during and after WWII, there was a tacit agreement of capital to participate in a formalized relationship with labor during contract negotiations. This “labor-capital accord” was facilitated by a unique context: powerful industrial unions in the economy’s large manufacturing sector, concessions to unions to keep industry operating during a time of war, and a general policy of federal support for private sector collective bargaining. After WWII, the growth of an anti-union business class and the beginning of a shift to neoliberal economic policy resulted in a steady erosion of organized labor’s power. By the 1970s and 1980s, a combination of forces resulted in unionism’s steady decline ever since. These trends included employer anti-union offensives, weakened labor laws, the exodus of many manufacturing jobs to foreign countries, and the “hunker down” mentality of the many unions, which failed to organize new members. [...] SEIU’s leadership, including President Stern, envisions these agreements as mechanisms to preempt this anti-union offensive and take pro-active steps to organize more workers. Without employer agreements, supporters contend, organizing drives would routinely fail in the face of union-busting tactics ranging from management harassment and intimidation to firing workers for involvement in union activities. Stern argues that these “value-added employer relationships” which include “assisting employers in overcoming unnecessary legislative and political obstacles” are a needed innovation in today’s globalized labor market. According to Stern and his backers, employer partnerships help achieve SEIU’s primary goal of industry-wide unionization in the building services, the public sector, and the healthcare industry. Despite employer hostility and the union-growth imperative, SMART argues that a mantra of organizing by “any means necessary” has sidelined democratic participation and compromised workers ability to mobilize for wage and benefit gains.|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} courts and {{administrative}} boards have long analyzed {{the status of}} graduate assistants within deficient frameworks that often lead to the wrong conclusions. While the New York University decision reflects a refreshing change, the real question raised by that opinion is not why the Board ruled the way it did, but why {{it took so long}} to do so, and why many states have yet to accord their graduate assistants <b>full</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining rights. The article is divided into five parts. Part I briefly surveys the state of graduate assistant organizing efforts with special focus on recent efforts at one private university (Yale) and one public university (Kansas). Part II examines how faculty and medical housestaff organizations have fared at universities, and how their plight is reflective of the same difficulties that graduate assistants have encountered. Part III sets out three analytic frameworks used by administrative and judicial bodies in their attempts to determine whether graduate assistants possess collective bargaining rights. Under the first framework, the graduate assistants 2 ̆ 7 right to bargain collectively depends on whether they are classified as students or employees. Under the second framework, the right depends on whether they are perceived as primarily students or employees. Finally, the third framework accepts that graduate assistants are employees; whether {{they have a right to}} bargain collectively, however, turns on whether they are the right kind of employees (the kind that deserve the protections of state or federal labor laws). Part IV discusses the principal deficiencies of the first two frameworks and argues that graduate assistants are inescapably employees of the university. The final part rebuts the policy arguments advanced in opposition to graduate student collective bargaining in the context of the third framework, and demonstrates that there are no compelling reasons to justify denying graduate assistants <b>full</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining rights...|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} of a nonphotosynthetic plastid in malaria and other apicomplexan parasites has sparked a contentious debate about its evolutionary origin. Molecular data have led to conflicting conclusions supporting either its green algal origin or red algal origin, perhaps {{in common with the}} plastid of related dinoflagellates. This distinction is critical to our understanding of apicomplexan evolution and the evolutionary history of endosymbiosis and photosynthesis; however, the two plastids are nearly impossible to compare due to their nonoverlapping information content. Here we describe the complete plastid genome sequences and plastid-associated data from two independent photosynthetic lineages represented by Chromera velia and an undescribed alga CCMP 3155 that we show are closely related to apicomplexans. These plastids contain a suite of features retained in either apicomplexan (four plastid membranes, the ribosomal superoperon, conserved gene order) or dinoflagellate plastids (form II Rubisco acquired by horizontal transfer, transcript polyuridylylation, thylakoids stacked in triplets) and encode a <b>full</b> <b>collective</b> complement of their reduced gene sets. Together with whole plastid genome phylogenies, these characteristics provide multiple lines of evidence that the extant plastids of apicomplexans and dinoflagellates were inherited by linear descent from a common red algal endosymbiont. Our phylogenetic analyses also support their close relationship to plastids of heterokont algae, indicating they all derive from the same endosymbiosis. Altogether, these findings support a relatively simple path of linear descent for the evolution of photosynthesis in a large proportion of algae and emphasize plastid loss in several lineages (e. g., ciliates, Cryptosporidium, and Phytophthora) ...|$|E

There is {{a growing}} tendency among civil employees to organize and to join the general labour movement. On the other hand, the government and certain important sections of public opinion are afraid of some consequences that collective bargaining might have, especially on {{the authority of the}} government as an employer. There is no reason why civil employees should not get substantially the same conditions as workers from private business. International agreements have recognized the right of association to every employee, including those working for governments, and the consequent right to bargain collectively their conditions of employment. Of course this right is to be exercised in different ways, according to special circumstances. The theory that civil servants should work under the unlimited and uncontrolled authority of the State, without a voice in the determination of their working conditions, is obsolete and totalitarian. As far as labour legislation and collective bargaining rights are concerned, the distinction should not be made between public and private workers, but between essential services for the nation and all the others. In some cases, government services are far less important and vital to the country than some others performed by private firms; in other cases, the government and private business are in direct competition.
