5|$|In {{preparation}} for the storm, ports were closed in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, while residents and tourists were <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> precautions in coastal areas. Also, ports were closed on the islands of Cozumel, Isla Mujeres and in Chetumal. Small boats were restricted from leaving some ports, but evacuations were deemed unnecessary. Tropical storm warnings were issued {{as soon as the}} storm was first classified for the coast of Belize and the coast of Mexico south of Cabo Catoche, and remained in effect until Arthur weakened to a tropical depression.|$|E

5|$|The {{player is}} often <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{advantage}} of environmental light sources and placing, {{and to use}} other light-based weapons and accessories, such as flare guns, hand-held flares and flashbangs. Wake can use searchlights to take out massive waves of Taken. Streetlights and other light stands can provide a safe haven, which the Taken cannot enter, and will regenerate the character's health faster. Otherwise, health regenerates slowly with time, when not taking any damage. In certain sections of the game, {{it is possible to}} use a car to traverse between locations in Bright Falls. When in a car, the player can run down Taken on the road, or boost the vehicle's headlights to destroy them.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{the late}} Welsh singer, scholar and writer Meredydd Evans {{proposed}} that Wales should {{have its own}} entry in the Eurovision Song Contest. In 1969, Cân i Gymru was launched by BBC Cymru Wales as a selection show for the contest, with songs to be performed in Welsh. However, {{it was decided that}} the BBC would continue to send one entry for the whole of the United Kingdom. Despite this, Cân i Gymru has been broadcast every year since, with the exception of 1973. The winning song takes part in the annual Pan Celtic Festival in Ireland. Wales has appeared as an independent country in another EBU production, Jeux Sans Frontières and Welsh national broadcaster S4C has been <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest. Wales is also eligible to take part in minority language song contest Liet-Lávlut, but has so far shown no interest. Wales participated in the inaugural Eurovision Choir of the Year in 2017, where they finished 2nd.|$|E

25|$|The last headmaster, John Morris, is a vocal {{critic of}} NCEA. In {{response}} to what is perceived by the school to be a poorly designed system being forced on them, the school introduced Cambridge International Examinations in 2002, offering the IGCSE, ASLevel and A2examinations to its more talented students. Other students sit NCEAexams. Students placed in an IGCSE/AS/A2 class are allowed to switch to NCEA, but this is usually discouraged by the school.

President Arthur would visit the park for two weeks in August, unaccompanied by any journalists. Through his notoriety with the Northern Pacific Railroad and early trips to Yellowstone, F.

25|$|The Malaysian {{health care}} system {{requires}} doctors to perform a compulsory three years service with public hospitals {{to ensure that the}} manpower in these hospitals is maintained. Recently foreign doctors have also been <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up employment in Malaysia. There is still, however, a significant shortage in the medical workforce, especially of highly trained specialists; thus, certain medical care and treatment are available only in large cities. Recent efforts to bring many facilities to other towns have been hampered by lack of expertise to run the available equipment.|$|E
25|$|Removal of ovaries causes {{hormonal}} {{changes and}} symptoms similar to, but generally more severe than, menopause. Women {{who have had}} an oophorectomy are usually <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> hormone replacement drugs to prevent other conditions often associated with menopause. Women younger than 45 who have had their ovaries removed face a mortality risk 170% higher than women who have retained their ovaries. Retaining the ovaries when a hysterectomy is performed is associated with better long-term survival. Hormone therapy for women with oophorectomies performed before age 45 improves the long-term outcome and all-cause mortality rates.|$|E
