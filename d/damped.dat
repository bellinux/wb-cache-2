40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{challenging}} {{to control the}} <b>damping</b> forces of magnetorheological (MR) fluid dampers because of the strong nonlinearity between the <b>damping</b> force of an MR fluid <b>damper</b> and the velocity across the <b>damper,</b> and the semiactive relationship between the <b>damping</b> force and the applied voltage/current. Hence, the desired <b>damping</b> force ought to be generated by an MR fluid <b>damper</b> cannot be commanded directly, only the command voltage applied to the current driver for the MR <b>damper</b> can be directly controlled. In this article, the configuration of a semiactive control system with MR fluid dampers is discussed and a <b>damper</b> controller based on signum function for MR fluid dampers is proposed. The <b>damper</b> controller is used to generate and adjust the command voltage to track the desired <b>damping</b> force determined by the system controller based on the desired and the actual <b>damping</b> forces. Two key factors for controlling the <b>damping</b> force of an MR fluid <b>damper</b> through a <b>damper</b> controller are considered in this article: (1) tracking ability of the controlled <b>damping</b> force to the desired <b>damping</b> force, and (2) energy requirement for the MR fluid <b>damper.</b> The characteristics of the controlled <b>damping</b> force and its corresponding command voltage are analyzed and compared with the Heaviside function <b>damper</b> controller. The simulation {{results show that the}} signum function controller outperforms the Heaviside function controller for better <b>damping</b> tracking ability while requiring less energy for the MR <b>damper.</b> Key Words: magnetorheological fluid <b>damper,</b> <b>damper</b> controller, semiactive control, signum function...|$|R

5|$|Currently Umbriel is not {{involved}} in any orbital resonance with other Uranian satellites. Early in its history, however, it may have been in a 1:3 resonance with Miranda. This would have increased Miranda's orbital eccentricity, contributing to the internal heating and geological activity of that moon, while Umbriel's orbit would have been less affected. Due to Uranus's lower oblateness and smaller size relative to its satellites, its moons can escape more easily from a mean motion resonance than those of Jupiter or Saturn. After Miranda escaped from this resonance (through a mechanism that probably resulted in its anomalously high orbital inclination), its eccentricity would have been <b>damped,</b> turning off the heat source.|$|E

Namaka's orbit has likely been disturbed by orbital resonances with the more-massive Hiʻiaka due to converging orbits as they moved outward from Haumea due to tidal dissipation. They may have been caught in and then escaped from orbital resonance several times; they currently are in or at least close to an 8:3 resonance. This resonance strongly perturbs Namaka's orbit, which has a current precession of its argument of periapsis by about −6.5° per year, a precession period of 55 years.|$|E
