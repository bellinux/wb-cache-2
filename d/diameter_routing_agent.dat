We have extended Mobile IP with <b>routing</b> <b>agents</b> that handle frequent local movements of a mobile node directly and shield {{them from the}} home agent that can be far away. This paper analyzes the performance of Mobile IP and the extension with <b>routing</b> <b>agents</b> in terms of registration cost, handoff delay, and packet tunneling cost.

40|$|Mobile IP is the {{proposed}} standard for IP mobility support. A mobile node registers its current location with its home agent when it moves across IP subnets {{in a foreign}} network.

40|$|Mobile IP is the {{proposed}} standard for IP based mobile internetworking by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). A mobile node registers its current location with its home agent when it moves across IP subnets {{in a foreign}} network. IP datagrams for the mobile node are routed to its home agent before being tunneled to the mobile node through its current foreign agent. When a mobile node is far away from home, registration with its home agent can cause a long handoff delay that leads to significant packet drop and throughput reduction.

40|$|Abstract We propose an {{energy-efficient}} hierarchical cluster-based routing (HCR) protocol where nodes self-organize into {{clusters and}} each cluster is managed {{by a set}} of associates called head-set. Using round-robin technique, each head-set member acts a cluster head (CH). The sensor nodes transmit data to their cluster heads, which transmit the aggregated data to the base station. Moreover, the energy-efficient clusters are retained {{for a longer period of}} time; the energy-efficient clusters are identified using heuristics-based approach. The HCR protocol is suitable for continuous monitoring applications. The simulation results show that HCR is more energy efficient than the traditional cluster-based routing protocols. Moreover, the proposed HCR protocol is improved by using agentbased architecture, where query and <b>routing</b> <b>agents</b> are deployed on the base station and sensor nodes.

Besides, with up-coming Quality of Service (QoS) requirements raised by a wide range of communication-intensive, real-time multimedia applications, the next-generation IP routers should be QoS-capable. Limited by the Moore's Law, one possible solution is to introduce parallelism as well as the Differentiated Service (DiffServ) scheme [5, 11] into the router architecture to provide QoS provision at a high speed and a low cost. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called the High-Performance QoS-capable IP Router (HPQR).

With the introduction of sophisticated multimedia applications, researchers have concentrated in finding solutions to make the Internet a suitable environment for such applications. The obvious solution is to enable applications reserve network resources according to their QoS needs. Researchers have also suggested enhancing the existing routing protocols for handling QoS. In this thesis, we present an end-to-end QoS architecture based on resource reservations. The architecture proposes the introduction of domain agencies in network domains. The domain agency is responsible for managing the resources in its domain and reserve resources according to the received requests from the users. It handles immediate and advance resource reservations and adapts the reserved resources according to user interactions.

The packets are cached until route-replies are received from the destination node. The buffer has a specific size and time limitation for caching packets beyond which packets are dropped.

This paper considers a scenario where a centralized network manager wishes to optimize utilities over all agents, i. e., implement a system-optimum routing policy. In many real-life scenarios, however, the system manager is unable to influence the route assignment of all agents due to limited influence on route choice decisions. Motivated by such scenarios, a computationally tractable method is presented that computes the minimal amount of agents that the system manager needs to influence (compliant agents) in order to achieve system optimal performance. Moreover, this methodology can also determine whether a given set of compliant agents is sufficient to achieve system optimum and compute the optimal route assignment for the compliant agents to do so. Experimental results are presented showing that in several large-scale, realistic traffic networks optimal flow can be achieved with as low as 13 % of the agent being compliant and up to 54 %...|$|R

40|$|South African {{metropolitan}} areas are experiencing rapid growth and require {{an increase in}} network infrastructure. Increased congestion negatively impacts both public and freight transport costs. The concept of City Logistics {{is concerned with the}} mobility of cities, and entails the process of optimizing urban logistics activities by concerning the social, environmental, economic, financial, and energy impacts of urban freight movement. In a costcompetitive environment, freight transporters often use sophisticated vehicle routing and scheduling applications to improve fleet utilization and reduce the cost of meeting customer demands. In this thesis, the candidate builds on the observation that vehicle routing and scheduling algorithms are inherent problem specific, with no single algorithm providing a dominant solution to all problem environments. Commercial applications mostly deploy a single algorithm in a multitude of environments which would often be better serviced by various different algorithms. This thesis algorithmically implements the ability of human decision makers to choose an appropriate solution algorithm when solving scheduling problems. The intent of the <b>routing</b> <b>agent</b> is to classify the problem as representative of a traditional problem set, based on its characteristics, and then to solve the problem with the most appropriate solution algorithm known for the traditional problem set. A not-so-artificially-intelligent-vehicle-routing-agent™ is proposed and developed in this thesis. To be considered intelligent, an agent is firstly required to be able to recognize its environment. Fuzzy c-means clustering is employed to analyze the geographic dispersion of the customers (nodes) from an unknown routing problem to determine to which traditional problem set it relates best. Cluster validation is used to classify the routing problem into a traditional problem set. Once the routing environment is classified, the agent selects an appropriate metaheuristic to solve the complex variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem. Multiple soft time windows, a heterogeneous fleet, and multiple scheduling are addressed in the presence of time-dependent travel times. A new initial solution heuristic is proposed that exploits the inherent configuration of customer service times through a concept referred to as time window compatibility. A high-quality initial solution is subsequently improved by the Tabu Search metaheuristic through both an adaptive memory, and a self-selection structure. As an alternative to Tabu Search, a Genetic Algorithm is developed in this thesis. Two new crossover mechanisms are proposed that outperform a number of existing crossover mechanisms. The first proposed mechanism successfully uses the concept of time window compatibility, while the second builds on an idea used from a different sweeping-arc heuristic. A neural network is employed to assist the intelligent <b>routing</b> <b>agent</b> to choose, based on its knowledge base, between the two metaheuristic algorithms available to solve the unknown problem at hand. The <b>routing</b> <b>agent</b> then not only solves the complex variant of the problem, but adapts to the problem environment by evaluating its decisions, and updating, or reaffirming its knowledge base to ensure improved decisions are made in future.
