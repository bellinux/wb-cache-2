40|$|The {{objective}} of this component of the CISNET San Pablo Bay project was {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the ecological impacts of chemical stressors on wildlife species in San Pablo Bay. Ecologically important forage fish species were studied as an <b>indicator</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> to predators in marsh, river, and Bay habitats. Chemical analysis of whole body fish was performed to obtain integrative measures of the degree of food web contamination in San Pablo Bay and to investigate the possible effects of this contamination on wildlife species. Mercury, selenium, PCBs, and DDT were detected in all of the habitats in which the two species were sampled. Concentrations of other contaminants were either well below known thresholds or not detectable. Average DDT (DDE + DDD) concentrations in striped bass (24 ppb wet) and sculpin (16 ppb wet) both exceeded a guideline of 14 ppb wet established by Environment Canada for protection of wildlife consumers of aquatic biota. Average mercury concentrations in striped bass (72 ppb wet) and sculpin (70 ppb wet) also both exceeded the 33 ppb wet guideline for methylmercury also established by Environment Canada for protection of fish predators. Selenium concentrations were all below the 3 ug/g dry threshold for effects on fis...|$|E

40|$|Purpose:The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{validate}} the commonly accepted <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> ischemic stroke that indicate the necessity for cerebral protection during carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and to examine the efficacy of high-dose thiopentone sodium (thiopental) as a cerebral protection method in patients who are at high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> intraoperative ischemic stroke. Method:In a prospective study of 37 CEAs performed for symptomatic stenosis > 70 %, functional and clinical <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> ischemic stroke during carotid cross-clamping were identified. Functional <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> were the development of ischemic electroencephalogram (EEG) changes and stump pressure < 25 mm Hg. Clinical <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> were previous ischemic hemispheric stroke and severe bilateral disease. These indicators were correlated in all patients, some of whom had two or three coexisting <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> The EEG and stump pressure were monitored continuously during carotid occlusion in all operations. Carotid occlusion times were recorded. Intraluminal shunting was eliminated in favor of high-dose thiopental cerebral protection in all patients. Neurologic outcome was deemed to measure the efficacy of thiopental protection in patients who are identified to be at risk and, hence, in need of cerebral protection. The validity <b>of</b> the <b>indicators</b> used to identify <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> ischemic stroke during CEA was assessed. Results:The absolute stroke risk was found to be 29. 7 % for the whole group (37 patients) and 57. 9 % in 19 patients who had commonly accepted indications for protective shunting. The correlation of ischemic EEG changes with stump pressure < 25 mm Hg was only 27. 3 °/x, whereas the expected correlation based on well-documented reports in the literature was 100 %. The lack of correlation may have been related to the prevention of ischemic EEG changes by thiopental. There were no neurologic deficits in the series. Conclusions:The absence of neurologic deficit in the study indicated that thiopental protection was effective in preventing ischemic stroke in high-risk patients and safely replaced intraluminal shunting...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Evaluating the {{interaction}} between mother or caregiver and infant through the Clinical <b>Indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>Risks</b> in Infant Development and investigating whether local and cultural influences during infant development affect these clinical indicators. INTRODUCTION: The Clinical <b>Indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>Risks</b> in Infant Development was created in order to fully assess infants' development and the subjective relationship between the babies and their caregivers. The absence {{of two or more}} Clinical <b>Indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>Risks</b> in Infant Developments suggests a possibly inadequate mental development. Given the continental size of Brazil and its accentuated cultural differences, one might question how trustworthy these indicators can be when applied to each of the geographical regions of the country. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study with 737 infants from the capitals of 9 Brazilian states. The size of the initial sample population was based on a pilot study carried out in the cities of São Paulo and Brasília. The ages of children were grouped: 0 - 3 months, 4 - 7 months, 8 - 11 months and 12 - 18 months. The chi-square test was used together with analyses by the statistical software SPSS 13. 0. RESULTS: Statistical analysis of results from the different municipalities against the total sample did not reveal any statistically significant differences. Municipalities represented were Belém (p= 0. 486), Brasília (p= 0. 371), Porto Alegre (p= 0. 987), Fortaleza (p= 0. 259), Recife (p= 0. 630), Salvador (0. 370), São Paulo (p= 0. 238), Curitiba (p= 0. 870), and Rio de Janeiro (p= 0. 06). DISCUSSION: Care for mental development should be considered a public health issue. Its evaluation and follow-up {{should be part of the}} already available mother-child assistance programs, which would then be considered to provide "full" care to children. CONCLUSIONS: Local habits and culture did not affect the results <b>of</b> the Clinical <b>Indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>Risks</b> in Infant Development <b>indicators.</b> Clinical <b>Indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>Risks</b> in Infant Development proved to be robust despite the specificities of each region...|$|R

40|$|Numerous agro-environmental {{indicators}} {{have been}} developed by agronomists and ecologists during the last 20 years to assess {{the environmental impact of}} farmers' practices, and to monitor effects of agro-environmental policies. The objectives of this paper were (i) to measure the accuracy of a wide range <b>of</b> agro-environmental <b>indicators</b> from experimental data and (ii) to discuss the value of different information typically used by these indicators, i. e. information on farmers' practices, and on plant and soil characteristics. Four series <b>of</b> <b>indicators</b> were considered in this paper: <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> habitat quality for grassland bird species, <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> disease in oilseed rape Crops, <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> pollution by nitrogen fertilizer, and <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> weed infestation. Several datasets were used to measure their accuracy in Cultivated plots and in grasslands. The sensitivity, specificity, and probability of correctly ranking plots were estimated for each indicator. Our results showed that the indicators had widely varying levels of accuracy. Some show very poor performance and had no discriminatory ability. Other indicators were informative and performed better than random decisions. Among the tested indicators, the best ones were those using information on plant characteristics such as grass height, fraction of diseased flowers, or crop yield. The statistical method applied in this paper could support researchers, farm advisers, and decision makers in comparing various indicators...|$|R

40|$|For prey {{animals to}} {{negotiate}} successfully the fundamental trade-off between predation and starvation, a realistic assessment <b>of</b> predation <b>risk</b> is vital. Prey responses to conspicuous <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> (such as looming predators or fleeing conspecifics) are well documented, but there {{should also be}} strong selection {{for the detection of}} more subtle cues. A predator's head orientation and eye-gaze direction are good candidates for subtle but useful <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk,</b> since many predators orient their head and eyes towards their prey as they attack. We describe the first explicit demonstration of a bird responding to a live predator's eye-gaze direction. We present wild-caught European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) with human ‘predators’ whose frontal appearance and gaze direction are manipulated independently, and show that starlings are sensitive to the predator's orientation, the presence of eyes and the direction of eye-gaze. Starlings respond in a functionally significant manner: when the predator's gaze was averted, starlings resumed feeding earlier, at a higher rate and consumed more food overall. By correctly assessing lower risk and returning to feeding activity earlier (as in this study), the animal gains a competitive advantage over conspecifics that do not respond to the subtle predator cue in this way...|$|R
