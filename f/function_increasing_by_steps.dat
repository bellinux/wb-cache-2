This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the role of real-time B-mode ultrasound in posterior decompression and reduction and to observe the signal changes in spinal cord blood flow in a thoracolumbar burst fracture (TBF). Between February 2004 and December 2008, 138 patients with TBF were divided into group A (108 cases) and group B (30 cases). In group A, under the assistance of real-time B-mode ultrasound, posterior decompression and fracture piece reduction were performed, and we observed the signal changes in spinal cord blood flow. In group B, posterior fenestration was combined with pushing the fracture piece into the fractured vertebral body using an L-shaped operative tool. Presurgical and postsurgical recovery of neurological function was evaluated according to American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) standards, {{and the range of}} spinal decompression was determined by measuring the proportion of encroached fracture piece in the spinal canal (spinal stenosis rate) on the computed tomography (CT) image. In group A, 12 patients had a grade A spinal injury according to the Frankel grading system, and there were six cases without neurological recovery.

All subjects were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of 8 weeks of treatments using universal goniometer for measurement of range of motion (ROM) of knee and visual analogue scale (V AS) for pain assessment and Arabic version of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) for measurement of pain, stiffness and physical function Results Both groups showed clinically and statistically significant improvement after 8 weeks of treatment. For group A, there was significant increase in range of motion of knee flexion by 18. 14 %, and extension by 78. 60 %, reduce in pain score by Sl. 9 Wkl, WOMAC questionnaire demonstrated great reduction in pain by 53. 07 %, stiffness by 58. 94 % and physical <b>function</b> <b>increased</b> <b>by</b> 49. 3 (YVC).
