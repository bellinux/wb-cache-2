40|$|AbstractMoored data buoys are {{offshore}} platforms, {{fitted with}} meteorological and oceanographic sensors anchored at various {{locations in the}} ocean.

40|$|Recorded strong-motion accelerograms may be {{affected}} by cross-axis sensitivity and the misalignment of their transducer sensitivity axes. The cross-axis sensitivity arises {{from the fact that}} the transducer mass when deflected from its ideal equilibrium position may experience additional deflection caused by the inertial forces perpendicular to the transducer's principal sensitivity axis. The misalignment effects result from imperfect positioning of transducers into the <b>instrument</b> <b>housing</b> so that the nominal sensitivity directions are not mutually perpendicular and/or do not coincide with the orthogonal reference frame attached to the <b>instrument</b> <b>housing.</b> If the misalignment effects cannot be accounted for, the recorded accelerations can be distorted by an amount, which for large input accelerations, may exceed the digitization noise level by as much as one order of magnitude. In this paper a method is presented for a complete dynamic correction procedure which can eliminate any cross-axis and misalignment effects and yield exact accelerations for a reference coordinate system conveniently attached to the <b>instrument</b> <b>housing.</b> To carry out these correction procedures it is necessary to know the precise orientations of all transducers relative to the selected reference frame. A simple sequence of static tilt tests is proposed which provides adequate information for computation of all misalignment angles and estimation of transducer sensitivity constants...|$|E

40|$|Geospace is {{the region}} of outer space near Earth, which {{includes}} the magnetosphere and the upper region of the atmosphere. It is a hazardous environment that contains high energy particles and is strongly dependant on the space weather. Studies show a high correlation between satellite operational anomalies, such as deep dielectric charging, and large flux enhancement of relativistic electrons in the outer radiation belt. An astronaut is exposed to radiation through high energy protons and relativistic electrons during extravehicular activities since these kinds of particles can penetrate a space suit. Furthermore, high energy particles can penetrate and transmit through instrument walls and thereby contaminate measurements through secondary electrons detected as noise. In order to prevent these radiation-induced effects {{it is crucial to}} explore and study how the space weather affects the radiation environment in geospace. The Energization and Radiation in Geospace (ERG) project is currently under development in the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) / Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) for the declining phase of solar cycle 24. The main objective of this mission is to understand the dynamics of the Earth’s radiation belts. The satellite will be launched into the inner magnetosphere in December 2015. A set of instruments to cover a wide energy range and measure both ions and electrons will be onboard. One of those instruments is the Low Energy Particle instrument for ions (LEP-i). It is very difficult to measure low energy particles (<tens of keV) inside the inner magnetosphere since high energy particles will contaminate the measurements and produce a high background noise level. Therefore it is of utmost importance that the instrument is sufficiently shielded, which lead to another challenge of minimizing the mass of the <b>instrument</b> <b>housing</b> during the design process. The purpose of this thesis has been to optimize the thickness of the LEP-i <b>instrument</b> <b>housing,</b> preferably to reduce the total mass of the original design. This has been done by evaluation of the noise count rate levels in the detector and the Total Ionization Dose (TID) of the electronics boards through numerical simulations. The simulations have been done in the software Geant 4, which is a toolkit for accurate simulation of particle passage through matter. Both the LEP-i instrument geometry and the satellite structure with the other onboard instruments have been included in the computer model. The results of the simulations; the noise count rate and the TID, have been plotted over the corresponding decrement in mass that the decrease of a wall thickness represent. From the simulations it has been concluded that the total mass of the LEP-i <b>instrument</b> <b>housing</b> can be reduced by approximately 1. 22 kg compared to the original housing design, through decrement of several housing walls. From a scientific point of view, an apogee altitude of at least 30 700 km for the ERG satellite, is necessary to successfully achieve the mission objectives. Due to the ERG satellite design, the mass decrement of the LEP-i instrument with 1. 22 kg is equivalent to an apogee altitude increment of approximately 0. 04 RE, compared to the original housing design. This altitude increment may be very valuable during mission execution. Validerat; 20130828 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{observatories}} {{have traditionally}} used small buildings or huts {{to provide a}} stable, protected and temperature controlled environment to accommodate the sensitive magnetic instruments. As instruments have evolved they have reduced in size and become less reliant on absolute mechanical stability but still require good temperature stability. Maintaining a stable temperature in large older buildings can be difficult and expensive due to their volume, the substantial thermal losses and undefined thermal properties of the construction materials. This report describes a modern <b>instrument</b> <b>housing</b> comprising a small-scale enclosure and low-power, non-magnetic heating elements controlled by a proportional–integral–derivative (PID) temperature controller. Operating magnetometers in a compact environment with other equipment requires careful selection of heating elements and minimising any sources of local interference.

The disadvantages and benefits of operating instruments in small enclosures are also discussed...|$|E

Fundamental concepts of engineering activities on the moon and how they can be applied to the establishment of a 16 -m large lunar telescope (LLT) are discussed. These fundamental concepts include the engineering response of lunar soils and how they affect construction activities, namely, drilling, blasting, ripping, digging and compaction. A mirror support structure and foundation design concept is proposed. The foundation considered is a multiple contact points spud-can type footing. It does not appear that a deep foundation or the presence of bedrock is required to achieve the telescope foundation stiffness. The LLT system will include a regolith covered housing, the size of a small room, which will contain sensitive electronic equipment including charge coupled devices which need protection from cosmic radiation effects.

Overall, the results of trending analysis show that the AVHRR instruments on NOAA- 18 / 19 and MetOp-A are functioning well outperforming the channel noise specification limits. The backup NOAA- 17 AVHRR functioned well for the on-orbit period prior to the onset of scan motor failure around April 11, 2010. The sun-earth-satellite geometry driven seasonality is exhibited by temperature measurements from thermistors on various <b>instrument</b> <b>housing</b> components including blackbody {{with the exception of}} patch temperature which is typically maintained stable. The only electrical measurement which exhibits seasonality is patch power. It is shown that the seasonality has no significant adverse impact on AVHRR radiometric performance. On the other hand the space view is adversely affected by intermittent periodic lunar signals and ubiquitous low frequency variability presumably connected to space clamping mechanism. Based on this it is suggested that the AVHRR channel noise estimation should be based on blackbody view. Finally, the temporal stability of the monitored parameters and the smaller or comparable magnitudes of seasonal variability in most of the instrument housekeeping measurements as compared to their orbital variability confirm th...|$|E

40|$|The Voyager Plasma Science (PLS) {{instrument}} {{is capable of}} returning integral (DC) current measurements, similar in some respects to measurements made with a Langmuir probe or a retarding potential analyzer, although there are significant differences. The integral measurements were made during a calibration sequence in the solar wind, during Cruise Science Maneuvers, and within the magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn by Voyager 1. After {{the failure of the}} PLS experiment following the Saturn encounter, that instrument was placed in the DC return mode returning possibly usable data from early 1981 through early 1985. The DC return measurements are difficult to interpret and are above threshold values only for relatively large fluxes; the determination of the measured current level is dependent on the operating temperature of the preamplifiers which further complicates the interpretation. Nevertheless, these measurements can be used to determine the efficiency of the suppressor grid at preventing the loss of secondary electrons off the collector plate. Some DC return measurements have been invaluable in aiding in the interpretation of some electron plasma measurements not previously understood. It is found that electron spectra can be significantly modified by the presence of second generation secondary electrons produced by either first generation secondaries or photoelectrons on the support ring of the negative high voltage modulator grid within the <b>instrument</b> <b>housing...</b>|$|E
