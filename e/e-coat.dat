40|$|Polypropylene {{and glass}} fibre (PP/GF) based Long Fibre Reinforced {{thermoplastics}} (LFT) are nowadays established as {{state of the}} art materials for semi-structural applications in the automotive industry. However, PP/GF LFT materials are limited for producing automotive components for use in general assembly. The use of LFT based components for structural applications and their implementation directly into the body in white assembly is still a challenge for the automotive industry. In order to develop LFT materials for such applications, a feasibility study to investigate the <b>e-coating</b> process sustainability of LFT materials was conducted. The current article addresses the developed LFT formulations and their basic mechanical properties. For this purpose polyamide / glass fibre (PA/GF) based LFT materials were thoroughly investigated. The change of mechanical performance of the LFT materials due to applied temperatures of the <b>e-coating</b> process was investigated by benchmar king of non-temperature-treated against tempered LFT specimens. In addition, the combined influence of temperatures and chemicals on the LFT properties was evaluated by running the LFT specimens through the actual painting line that included <b>e-coating</b> and subsequent painting and drying processes. Finally it was found {{that it is possible to}} manufacture LFT parts capable of withstanding the <b>e-coating</b> process without causing major changes in the performance of the LFT materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{content of}} this thesis is the {{simulation}} of the <b>e-coating</b> process (cathodic electrocoating process) {{used in the}} automotive industry, in which the first paint layer that provides the main corrosion protection, is applied. The main aim of the simulation {{is to find out}} critical areas, where a minimum layer thickness will not be reached and give the necessary information earlier in the product development process, which leads to reduction of tryouts costs. The numerical simulations were performed by software THESEUS-FE <b>E-Coating</b> Module, which is based on the finite element method. Firstly, a detailed coating thickness measurement was performed to determine the coating distribution on a car body. Thereafter, {{on the basis of the}} car body CAD data and <b>e-coating</b> bath measurements, a finite element model (FE-model) of the car body in the bath was built. In order to reconstruct the measured coating thicknesses as good as possible, different simulation models and methods were investigated. The influences of holes and positioning of hood and doors on the process were also investigated. Furthermore, different voltage programs were considered in order to classify the influence of the voltage program and anodes positioning on the process in general. Also, the areas in the car body cavities without full paint coverage, which are of special interest for planning process, were identified. In order to avoid this, some additional holes on the car body were inserted, and thereafter the comparison of the simulation results and a real experiment should be performed. Moreover, in order to calibrate the lacquer parameters, experiments with a test-box, which is suitable for the throwing power measurement, were performed and thereafter simulated. Unfortunately, the calibration through the text-box was not very useful due to different process conditions between the test-box experiments and the <b>e-coating</b> process performed in a real paint shop. However, a detailed sensitivity analysis of different simulation parameters was also performed by means of test-box, in order to determinate the influence of certain parameters on the process...|$|R

50|$|Simultaneously, {{preparation}} work on {{a completely}} new product continued. The Daewoo Avia's new Korean management team staked a demanding goal consisting of development and manufacturing of a completely new medium duty truck, which would cover the 6 to 9 tonnes gvw weight class and would be fully competitive in Western European markets and further afield in terms of design and operating costs. The vehicle cab, which was styled in Italy and provided maximum comfort both to driver and crew, was the most significant new component of the vehicle. The designers at Daewoo's Worthing (UK) engineering centre led {{the development of the}} new cab and its interior, while Daewoo Avia specialist designers at the Letnany factory were responsible for the project co-ordination, and engine/chassis development. The total spend on the project was over $160 million—split approximately 50-50 between R&D and manufacturing upgrades. The major investments in manufacturing were the new Eisenmann water-based paint plant—including the <b>e-coat</b> plant which was installed to degrease, prepare and prime the cabs by full electro-cataphoretic full immersion process and a new cab welding line.|$|E
50|$|All of {{the parts}} showing wear or damage that were {{originally}} painted are typically stripped of old paint, with any rust or rust related damage repaired, dents and ripples removed and then the metal refinished, primed and painted with colors to match the original factory colors. Wooden parts should {{go through the same}} meticulous inspection and repair process with reglueing, replacement of rotted or termite-damaged wood, sealing and refinishing to match the factory specifications. Pressure treatment with preservative may be considered to safeguard against future wood rot. Chrome and trim may require stripping and repair/refinishing. Fasteners with tool marks, damaged threads, or corrosion need re-plating or replacement-unless the car was originally sold that way. The frame must be thoroughly cleaned and repaired if necessary. Often abrasive blasting of the frame is the most expeditious method of cleaning, but it may still leave microscopic rust pitting behind, so should be followed up with a phosphoric acid 'rust killer' solution, before priming. Abrasive blasting using less abrasive soda or crushed walnut shells is less likely than sandblasting to cause damage to fragile items, while still removing corrosion. Acid tank dipping of the frame and or body followed by an <b>E-coat</b> primer after repairs is recognised as the most effective but also most expensive {{way to get rid of}} rust and to protect against future corrosion. The chassis frame should be properly coated for rust protection to at least match the standard of the original, to the highest modern standard would safeguard the time and money invested in the restoration.|$|E

Tensile tests are performed shortly after four steps in the production process: the shipment of the two alloys, a certain period of storage, uniaxial pre-stretching, and heat treatment that corresponds to the temperature profile during <b>e-coating.</b> Results are displayed as a function of orientation with reference to rolling direction, {{as a function of the}} level of uniaxial pre-stretching and as function of the temperature profile...|$|R
5000|$|An {{addition}} to the electrostatic coating (or <b>e-coating)</b> process is dipping electrically conductive parts into a tank of paint that is then electrostatically charged.

Once the parts are removed from the paint tank, they are rinsed off to remove any residual paint that is not ionically bonded, leaving a thin film of electrostatically bonded paint {{on the surface of the}} part.|$|R

40|$|A study {{examining}} {{the effect of}} coatings on the quality and behaviour of self-piercing riveted joints between aluminium and steel sheets was conducted. NG 5754 and AA 5182 aluminium and {{high strength low alloy}} (HSLA) steel were used for this investigation. Two types of coatings, <b>E-coat</b> and zinc plate were applied to the HSLA steel and AA 5182 aluminium sheets. The results showed that the presence of a coating on the surface of HSLA and AA 5182 affected the joint quality in terms of head height, interlock distance and remaining material thickness. Examination of joint sections indicated that the self-piercing riveting process needed different setting parameters for coated and uncoated sheets in order to achieve optimum setting conditions. The study has also shown that both the <b>E-coat</b> and zinc plate coatings affected the joint strength and the failure mechanism under static loading conditions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: <b>E-coating</b> {{process is}} widely used to provide a {{protective}} coating layer on metal parts in the automotive and metal finishing industry. The wastewater from the coating process contains organic compounds {{that are used in}} the cleaning, pretreatment and coating steps. Organic pollutants can be removed biologically. In the aerobic biological treatment, water aeration accounts for {{a significant portion of the}} total operating cost of the treatment process. Intermittent aeration is thus of benefit since it would reduce the energy consumption in the wastewater treatment. In the present study, wastewater from an electro-coating process was treated biologically using a packed column as an aerator where the wastewater was aerated by a countercurrent air flow. The objective was to obtain an optimum aeration cycle. Approach: Intermittent aeration time was varied at different preset cycles. An operational optimum of the aeration time (or air-water contacting time in the column) was determined from the BOD 5 removal after a certain treatment period. For continuous aeration of the wastewater, the air-liquid contacting time in the column was 52 min for 24 h of treatment. A unit energy consumption for pumping liquid and air, which was defined as the energy consumption per percent BOD 5 removed, was used as a criterion to determine the optimum contacting time.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{significant}} fouling by particulate matter can have a deleterious effect on the performance of enhanced surface heat exchangers, and {{the same is true for}} hybrid heat exchangers. Hybrid heat exchangers are heat exchangers which are typically run in dry mode to reject heat. When the ambient conditions require more heat rejection than can be provided by sensible heat transfer a water pump is turned on and water flows over the fins and the evaporation of water provides a further cooling effect. Fouling in dry mode operation is physically similar to that of air-cooled heat exchangers, but in evaporative mode the flow of the water over the coil eliminates the impact of fouling. A hybrid dry cooler heat exchanger of 60 cm x 60 cm frontal area has been installed in a well-instrumented wind tunnel to measure the heat exchanger’s performance. Hot water flows through the coil to provide the load, and air flows over the coil to provide cooling. During evaporative mode operation another stream of water flows over the outside face of the coil, adhering mainly to the louvered fins. The louvered fins are specially designed for optimized water flow during wetting mode. The fins are made of aluminum, the tubes are copper, and protection against corrosion is realized by a special <b>E-coating.</b> This coil has been tested clean and fouled with ASHRAE standard dust, for both dry and wet operation. Results are presented for the air side pressure drop and overall heat transfer conductance of the coil under all conditions for which 50 % increases in air-side pressure drop are found under heavy fouling. The influence of fouling on heat transfer is small. Also, using the wetting water to wash the fouling off the coil is investigated, and found to be of some limited utility. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Modern car-bodies {{consist of}} {{different}} types of metals in order to gain the best crash performance at minimal weight. After the press and body shop, the bodies in white run through several paint drying processes, where also alloys of the 6 xxx series become heat-treated. Consequently, the different thermal expansion behaviour of joined aluminium-steel components leads to high bending stress conditions within the car body structure while they heat up to 200 °C. In order to describe the process deformations numerical simulations were developed, where appropriate material models are necessary. Especially aluminium alloys with a melting point of about 600 °C can exhibit viscoplastic behaviour at 200 °C under stress. In this work, creep characteristics of the aluminium alloy AA 6016 are investigated using a bending test.

Different insulation systems were evaluated based on electrical, mechanical, ther­ mal, chemical and manufacturing properties as well as cost factors. Of these, the electri­ cal properties were experimentally examined. The core of the thesis was the experimental determination of the insulation resistance and dielectric breakdown voltage of different coating systems. These coatings can be grouped into anodization, a ceramic coating, polymer powder coatings, liquid paints and insulating films. The electrical tests performed showed that anodization, the ceramic coating, some powder coating systems and a coating process named <b>e-coat</b> do not suffice {{with regard to the}} two quantities under consideration.

40|$|Vehicle {{bodies are}} {{generally}} constructed from galvanized steel, which, together with phosphate and <b>e-coat</b> paint treatments, ensures corrosion resistance. The {{use of these}} materials alone cannot provide adequate corrosion protection to certain features that are inherent to vehicle body construction but are also vulnerable to corrosion, such as cut edges of panels and creviced joints. The use of further corrosion protection measures, (e. g. sealers, lacquers and waxes), is undesirable because they require additional manufacturing processes, increase weight and reduce recyclability of the vehicle. The potential benefits of using zinc-magnesium alloy coated steel (ZMG) {{as a substitute for}} conventional galvanized steel were investigated in this work. Cyclic corrosion testing in sodium chloride and acid rain- based environments was conducted on panels of ZMG and conventional galvanized steel and the resistance of each material to red rust initiation and propagation was assessed. ZMG offered approximately a 3 -fold improvement in red rust resistance compared to galvanized steel in the sodium chloride test but ZMG's corrosion benefit was attenuated in the acid rain environment. Cyclic corrosion testing was also conducted on painted test panels incorporating geometric features; enhanced edge and crevice corrosion resistance was also observed for panels constructed from ZMG. Corrosion products formed in each environment were characterized using a suite of analysis techniques and mechanisms to explain the enhanced corrosion resistance of ZMG were proposed based on these products and on the literature. An inhibiting corrosion protection mechanism was suggested for ZMG whereby cathodic activity was quenched via the precipitation of insulating, sparingly soluble magnesium hydroxide. Further inhibition of cathodic activity has been attributed to the special oxide layer present at the ZMG surface.
