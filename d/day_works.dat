5000|$|Modern <b>day</b> <b>works</b> {{continue}} to support {{the claims of the}} ancients that rhetoric is an art capable of influencing civic life. In his work Political Style, Robert Hariman claims, [...] "Furthermore, questions of freedom, equality, and justice often are raised and addressed through performances ranging from debates to demonstrations without loss of moral content". James Boyd White argues further that rhetoric is capable not only of addressing issues of political interest but that it can influence culture as a whole. In his book, When Words Lose Their Meaning, he argues that words of persuasion and identification define community and civic life. He states that words produce [...] "... the methods by which culture is maintained, criticized, and transformed." [...] Both White and Hariman agree that words and rhetoric have the power to shape culture and civic life.|$|E
5000|$|Monasteries and convents {{are common}} in Bhutan. Both monks and nuns keep their heads shaved and wear {{distinguishing}} maroon robes. Their days are spent in study and meditation {{but also in the}} performance of rituals honoring various bodhisattvas, praying for the dead, and seeking the intercession of bodhisattvas on behalf of the ill. Some of their prayers involved chants and singing accompanied by conch shell trumpets, trumpets made from human thighbones, metal horns up to three meters long, large standing drums and cymbals, hand bells, temple bells, gongs, and wooden sticks. Such monastic music and singing, not normally heard by the general public, has been reported to have [...] "great virility" [...] and to be more melodious than its Tibetan monotone counterparts. Common people do practice the religion in their own ways: day to <b>day</b> <b>works,</b> in their speech, in their thought and visiting the holy place and persons on holy dates (holy dates are the 8, 10, 15, 25, 28 and 30th day in a month in Bhutanese calendar).|$|E

5000|$|Sunday is {{described}} as a fulfillment of the spiritual truth of the Jewish Sabbath and an announcement of man's eternal rest in God.

[...] Thus, Sunday worship fulfills the [...] "moral command of the Old Covenant, taking up its rhythm and spirit in the weekly celebration of the Creator and Redeemer of his people."The Catholic Church teaches that the Lord's day should be [...] "a day of grace and rest from work" [...] to cultivate their [...] "familial, cultural, social, and religious lives." [...] On Sundays and other holy days, faithful Christians are to refrain from work and activities that hinder the worship owed to God, the joy proper to the Lord's <b>Day,</b> <b>works</b> of mercy, and the [...] "appropriate relaxation of mind and body." [...] Christians also sanctify Sunday by giving time and care to their families and relatives, often difficult to do on other days of the week. [...] "Sunday is a time for reflection, silence, cultivation of the mind, and meditation which furthers the growth of the Christian interior life." [...] In addition to one's own rest, Christians should avoid making unnecessary demands on others that would hinder them from observing the Lord's Day.|$|E
