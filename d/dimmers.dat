5|$|In general appearance, {{the current}} {{operating}} line of SIR looks somewhat like an outdoor {{line of the}} New York City Subway. Since the 1960s, it has been grade separated from all roads, but it runs more or less at street level for a brief stretch north of Clifton, between the Grasmere and Old Town stations, and from south of the Pleasant Plains station to Tottenville, {{the end of the}} line. It uses NYC Transit-standard 600 V DC third rail power. Its equipment are R44 subway type cars that are specially modified with headlight <b>dimmers,</b> electric windshield defrosters, FRA Compliant cab signals and horns, and FRA regulation 223 required shatterproof glazing, and exterior mounted grab rails near the side doors. The cars were built in early 1973, {{at the tail end of}} the R44 order of subway cars for New York City Transit (the Staten Island R44s being the last cars built by the St. Louis Car Company). Heavy maintenance of the equipment is performed at NYCT's Clifton Shops. Any work that cannot be performed at Clifton requires the cars to be trucked over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the subway's Coney Island Complex shops in Brooklyn. The right-of-way also includes elevated, embankment and open-cut portions, and a tunnel near St. George.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{buildings}} in the new World Trade Center complex, One World Trade Center includes sustainable architecture features. Much of the building's structure and interior is built from recycled materials, including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles; around 80percent of the tower's waste products are recycled. Although the roof area of any tower is limited, the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems. The building's PureCell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate 4.8megawatts (MW) of power, and its waste steam generates electricity. The New York Power Authority selected UTC Power to provide the tower's fuel cell system, {{which was one of}} the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed. The tower also makes use of off-site hydroelectric and wind power. The windows are made of an ultra-clear glass, which allows maximum sunlight to pass through; the interior lighting is equipped with <b>dimmers</b> that automatically dim the lights on sunny days, reducing energy costs. Like all of the new facilities at the World Trade Center site, One World Trade Center is heated by steam, with limited oil or natural gas utilities on-site. One World Trade Center is expected to receive a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold Certification, making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dimmers</b> {{based on}} Insulated-gate bipolar {{transistors}} (IGBTs) {{do away with}} most of the noise present in TRIACs by chopping off the falling side of the sine wave. These are termed Trailing Edge <b>Dimmers.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Carter {{moved back}} to Dunedin, later saying that he [...] "dropped out, I suppose" [...] and [...] "wanted to get {{grounded}} after all my running around". While there, he began using the name <b>Dimmer</b> as [...] "an umbrella thing...with me as the common denominator". The first <b>Dimmer</b> music came from jam sessions in Dunedin. Carter explained in 2012 that [...] "I used the name <b>Dimmer</b> because I thought using your own name was really uncool." ...|$|R
50|$|Before this {{putative}} fifth album ever happened, in 2012, Carter {{decided to}} end <b>Dimmer</b> and operate {{under his own}} name. A four-piece consisting of the 'Brockville' trio plus James Duncan played <b>Dimmer's</b> two final live shows in Auckland and Wellington.|$|R
5000|$|... “My first albums as <b>Dimmer</b> {{were quiet}} and {{introverted}} as a kickback against all that rock glory. But <b>Dimmer’s</b> been going {{a while now}} and when I went back and felt that rock glory, I thoroughly enjoyed it.”- Shayne Carter, September 2006 ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{incandescent}} lamps, some color changes occur as a lamp is dimmed, allowing for {{a limited amount of}} color control through a dimmer. Fades (brightness transitions) can be either UP or DOWN, meaning that the light output is increasing or decreasing during the transition. Most modern <b>dimmers</b> are solid state, though many mechanical <b>dimmers</b> are still in operation.|$|E
25|$|Dimmable LED lamps are {{available}} from several vendors, although not all LED lamps are compatible with <b>dimmers</b> and their color temperature may not lower, as it does with incandescents.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dimmers</b> are devices used to {{vary the}} {{brightness}} of a light. By decreasing or increasing the RMS voltage and hence the mean power to the lamp {{it is possible to}} vary the intensity of the light output. Although variable-voltage devices are used for various purposes, a dimmer is specifically those devices intended to control lighting. <b>Dimmers</b> are popularly used in venues such as movie theatres, stages, dining rooms, restaurants, and auditoriums where the need or absence of light during activities requires constant change. The dimmer was invented in 1892 by Granville Woods.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the demise}} of Straitjacket Fits, in 1995 Carter formed the group <b>Dimmer.</b> This began largely as a solo project with Carter as the {{creative}} nucleus, working with different musicians for recordings and performances. In its later years, <b>Dimmer</b> was a settled four-piece band.|$|R
5000|$|Their 2007 {{trip to the}} USA, which {{included}} performing at South By Southwest, was <b>Dimmer's</b> first tour outside New Zealand - Carter hadn't played in America since Straitjacket Fits in 1993. Shows in Australia followed later in the year. <b>Dimmer</b> continued performing live into 2009, appearing at Auckland's Homegrown festival in March. Comparing 2009's <b>Dimmer</b> to the incarnation that had recorded There My Dear, Carter called it [...] "a far more confident band, and a far more together band. We are actually quite close as people." ...|$|R

25|$|Some <b>dimmers</b> in {{residential}} applications are also {{equipped with a}} radio receiver {{to be used as}} wireless light switches which can be remotely controlled by a radio transmitter.|$|E
25|$|Lighting control tools {{might best}} be {{described}} as anything that changes the quality of the light. Historically this has been done by the use of intensity control. Technological advancements have made intensity control relatively simple - solid state <b>dimmers</b> are controlled by one or more lighting controllers. Controllers are commonly lighting consoles designed for sophisticated control over very large numbers of <b>dimmers</b> or luminaires, but may be simpler devices which play back stored sequences of lighting states with minimal user interfaces. Consoles are also referred to as lighting desks or light-boards.|$|E
25|$|Outside {{electrical}} interference may be amplified by the magnetic cartridge. Common household wallplate SCR <b>dimmers</b> sharing AC lines may put noise into the playback, as can poorly shielded electronics and strong radio transmitters.|$|E

25|$|Mechanical dimming {{shutters}} used to {{vary the}} intensity of the light output. Mechanical <b>dimmers</b> are usually a specially designed disk or a mechanical shutter. Shutters with high speed stepper motors can be used to create strobe effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{lighting}} controller {{is connected to}} the <b>dimmers</b> (or directly to automated luminaires) using a control cable or wireless link (e.g. DMX512) or network, allowing the <b>dimmers</b> which are bulky, hot and sometimes noisy, to be positioned away from the stage and audience and allowing automated luminaires to be positioned wherever necessary. In addition to DMX512, newer control connections include RDM (remote device management) which adds management and status feedback capabilities to devices which use it while maintaining compatibility with DMX512; and Architecture for Control Networks (ACN) which is a fully featured multiple controller networking protocol. These allow the possibility of feedback of position, state or fault conditions from units, whilst allowing much more detailed control of them.|$|E
25|$|Thyristors {{have been}} used for decades as {{lighting}} <b>dimmers,</b> in television, motion pictures, and theater, where they replaced inferior technologies such as autotransformers and rheostats. They have also been used in photography as a critical part of flashes (strobes).|$|E

5000|$|Two non-album singles were {{released}} by <b>Dimmer</b> in the mid-90s: ...|$|R
50|$|All four of <b>Dimmer's</b> albums were {{admired by}} critics, and all earned {{multiple}} New Zealand Music Award nominations. Non-album singles were released in 1995 and 1996, with debut album I Believe You Are A Star not following until 2001. In 2004 You've Got To Hear The Music was named New Zealand's Best Rock Album for the year, and <b>Dimmer</b> named Best Group. There My Dear saw Carter return to playing and recording {{with a live}} rock band in 2006. Final album Degrees of Existence (2009) was recorded by the longest-lasting version of the band. <b>Dimmer's</b> final shows were played in 2012.|$|R
25|$|Early <b>dimmers</b> were {{directly}} controlled through the manual manipulation of large dimmer panels. This required all power {{to come through}} the lighting control location, which could be inconvenient, inefficient and potentially dangerous for large or high-powered systems, such as those used for stage lighting.|$|E
25|$|When {{solid-state}} <b>dimmers</b> {{came into}} use, analog {{remote control systems}} (such as 0-10 V lighting control systems) became feasible. The wire for the control systems was much smaller (with low current and lower danger) than the heavy power cables of previous lighting systems. Each dimmer had its own control wires, resulting in many wires leaving the lighting control location.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 70s serial {{analogue}} protocols were developed. These multiplexed {{a series of}} analogue levels onto a single wire, with embedded clocking signal similar to a composite video signal (in the case of Strand Lighting's European D54 standard, handling 384 <b>dimmers)</b> or separate clocking signal (in {{the case of the}} US standard AMX192).|$|E

25|$|Ford- and Chrysler-built {{vehicles}} were also available with the GM-made <b>dimmers</b> from the 1950s through the 1980s. A system called 'AutoDim' was offered on several Lincoln models {{starting in the}} mid-1950s, and eventually the Ford Thunderbird and some Mercury models offered it as well. Premium Chrysler and Imperial models offered a system called Automatic Beam Control throughout the 1960s and early 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly, modern {{lighting}} {{instruments are}} available which allow remote control of effects other than light intensity, including direction, color, beam shape, projected image, and beam angle. The {{ability to move}} an instrument ever more quickly and quietly is an industry goal. Some automated lights have built-in dimming and so are connected directly to the control cable or network and are independent of external <b>dimmers.</b>|$|E
25|$|In many cases, a dimmer can be {{replaced}} by a constant power module (CPM), which is typically a 20- or 50-ampere breaker in a dimming module casing. CPMs are used to supply line voltage to non-dimming electrical devices such as smoke machines, chain winches, and scenic motors that require constant operating voltage. When a device is powered by a CPM, it is fully energized whenever the CPM is turned on, independent of lighting console levels. CPMs must be used (in lieu of <b>dimmers)</b> to power non-dimming devices that require specific line voltages (e.g., in the US, 110 V, 60Hz power) in order to avoid damage to such devices. <b>Dimmers</b> are seldom used to control non-dimming devices because even if a dimmer channel is trusted to always operate at full power, it may not be controlled when communications are disrupted by start up and shut down of the lighting control surface, noise interference, or DMX disconnects or failure. Such a loss of control might cause a dimmer to dim a circuit and thus potentially damage its non-dimming device.|$|E
