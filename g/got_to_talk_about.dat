While {{the song is}} against the {{commercialisation}} of Christmas, {{it has often been}} misinterpreted as an anti-religious song and, because of this, Lake was surprised at its success. He explained in a Mojo magazine interview:"I find it appalling when people say it's politically incorrect to talk about Christmas, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> 'The Holiday Season'. Christmas was a time of family warmth and love. There was a feeling of forgiveness, acceptance. And I do believe in Father Christmas." ...|$|E
50|$|Tom Adams and Bart Schoorl <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> {{their passion}} of death/thrash metal as volunteers at 013, a pop/rock venue in Tilburg. Tom had {{contacted}} Yuma van Eekelen which he knew {{as a friend}} from the singer of his last band. In the meantime Bart had spoken to his friend Marc van Stiphout about a potential new formation. A month later after Tom and Yuma had finished their first song (eventually called “the homecoming”) Stip and Bart {{came over to the}} rehearsal room in 013 and immediately were enthousiastic and a new band was born. However, within a month it became clear that in order to deliver first-class quality death/thrash songs that offered enough variety, the recruitment of a second guitar player was inevitable. After a six-month quest this musician was found in the person of Michiel Oskam, an old schoolmate of Tom Adams. Not only with his unique playing skills, but also with his personality, Michiel proved to be the right man for the job.|$|E

One of these is virtual meeting places where people meet and exchange information, socialize and exchange knowledge with each other. The group has chosen to examine the factors affecting the use of web forums, one of the virtual meeting places that exist on the Internet today. And look at how people use the web forum today in the current situation and how to design a web forum. A survey was conducted {{to find out how}} people look at web forums today, 80 people participated, and they <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> what they think about different web forums regarding how and why the use these them. Guidelines on how a web forum should be designed were also developed. An interview was also carried out to a specific audience to see if there were special needs and interests that they had, so that we could take that into account {{in the development of the}} guidelines that are to be used in the design for this web forum. The group carried out a user tests on a mockup designed to investigate how people would respond and use the web forums of different age groups. The results showed that many users of web forums today are different between users, depending on gender and age. The use of various web forums depends on that they have different needs and interests. This dose so the layout of the web forum must be directed so as to be adapted for any specific audience. Mainly people used web forums as an information source where you can find answers and ask questions to others. Two factors must be fulfilled for a page to be able to grow, and that is trust and credibility. This can be fulfilled by its members if they can create an identity for them self in the virtual meeting place. It is also important for lurkers on a virtual meeting place that they show commitment, support and encourage members to be active participant. The lurker’s role is an important one when the site goes throw its state of maturity and growth.   Keywords: Web Forum, virtual meeting places, user study...|$|E
40|$|The Matrix Intensive Outpatient Treatment for People with Stimulant Use Disorders, Counselor’s Treatment Manual, {{originally}} published in 1995 by the Matrix Center and reproduced by SAMHSA in 2006, {{has been used by}} thousands of addiction treatment counselors. The Matrix treatment model grew from a need for structured, evidence-based treatment for clients who abuse or are dependent on stimulant drugs, particularly methamphetamine and cocaine. The program model has been well received by the addiction treatment field, and the demand for the Matrix program materials has been very high. At the same time, as the field became more experienced {{with the use of the}} program materials, a need was identified for tailoring of program materials to certain special populations. In 2005, an adaptation to the Matrix materials was developed for Native American/ American Indian persons. In 2006, an additional adaptation was prepared for men who have sex with men. These adaptations address unique concerns and needs of these populations and enhance the appeal of the Matrix program for these audiences. The development of Using Matrix with Women Clients: A Supplement to the Matrix Intensive Outpatient Treatment for People with Stimulant Use Disorders continues efforts to tailor the Matrix program materials to a distinct audience. Much has been learned over the past decade about the unique substance abuse treatment needs and concerns of women. This knowledge has been applied to the women’s supplement. It covers the importance of relationships in women’s recovery; issues of trauma, abuse, and violence; sexuality and sex for money; body image and weight control; parenting and pregnancy; and family roles. Given the relatively high proportion of women seeking treatment for stimulant dependence, this adaptation is very timely. During the field test of this new material, women commented on their experiences with the added sessions. Some of the comments were as follows: “Thank you for creating a safe space for women. It has made a radical difference in my recovery. ” “I liked finding strength-based solutions to my challenges in recovery. Thank you. It’s so awesome and empowering. ” “My first session was today and it was so liberating and empowering! I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> things I never would have in front of men in the regular ER group. ” These comments are reflective of other women-only group experiences for women participating in treatment and speak to the importance for addressing women’s unique concerns in the safety and comfort of a women-only group. This manual is a supplementary programme to the main Matrix counselor’s treatment manual. As it was developed for use in the US treatment context, some areas will need to be carefully adapted for use in the UK. The proposed group sessions have been tailored to the specific needs of women in substance misuse treatment services, aiming to make them more responsive, accessible and relevant to women service users. This manual contains comprehensive materials for an additional 10 session group treatment programme for service users with stimulant use problems. The sessions include: • Issues of trauma • Abuse • Violence • Sex and sexuality • Sex for money • Body image and weight control • Pregnancy and parenting • Family roles.
