However, Lois's father, Carter, begins to lose money in the timber industry since hemp is being used to manufacture many products, particularly paper, and he bribes Peter to help him with an anti-marijuana campaign. Lois, however, points out that their methods are uninspired, explaining that Brian only succeeded because he was passionate about legalizing cannabis. Carter decides to bribe Brian to join his cause by publishing and shipping his novel, Faster Than the Speed of Love. Brian resists at first, but Stewie suggests he at least perform a number about the health risks of cannabis, since the book does not have enough merit to sell on its own. Brian reluctantly complies, and the drug becomes illegal once more.|$|E

This, coupled with the improvement of farming equipment and techniques, such as the introduction of the heavy wheeled plough, resulted in an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>productivity</b> that impacted the people's lifestyles. The distribution of this increased productivity between peasants and lords was regulated by the establishment of foros or lifelong contracts, frequently spanning several generations or vozes.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{agricultural production}} and <b>productivity</b> growth <b>in</b> two Central Asian countries – Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Both countries {{are characterized by}} a significant shift of resources from the traditional Soviet model of collective agriculture to more market-compliant individual and family farming. In both countries, {{the beginning of the}} policy-driven switch to family farming around 1997 coincided with the beginning of recovery in agriculture, namely resumption of agricultural growth after a phase of transition decline since 1991. In addition to growth in total agricultural production, we also observe significant <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>productivity</b> of both land and labor since 1997. These observations suggest that productivity growth may be attributable to the changes in farming structure in Central Asia. To check this conjecture we assess the sources of growth by applying the standard Solow growth accounting methodology. Using time series of country statistics for farms of different organizational forms, we decompose the growth in output into growth in the resource base (extensive growth) and growth <b>in</b> <b>productivity</b> (intensive growth). Solow growth accounting clearly shows that, first, much of the growth at the country level is attributable to <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>productivity</b> rather than <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> resources and, second, the <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>productivity</b> <b>in</b> family farms (especially household plots) outstrip the <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>productivity</b> <b>in</b> former collective and state farms. These findings confirm that the recovery of agricultural production in Central Asia has been driven largely by productivity increases, and it is the individual farms that are the main source of agricultural productivity increases. agricultural productivity, agricultural growth, family farms, corporate farms, comparative performance, agrarian reforms, transition countries, Central Asia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Agricultural and Food Policy, Community/Rural/Urban Development, Food Security and Poverty, International Development, Land Economics/Use, Productivity Analysis, P 27, P 31, P 32, Q 15, R 14,...|$|R
25|$|Since {{the onset}} of the Green Revolution {{in the middle of the}} last century, vast amounts of {{nitrogen}} fertilizers have been produced and introduced to almost all agricultural systems. This has led to increases in plant available nitrogen in ecosystems around the world due to agricultural runoff and wind-driven fertilization. As discussed earlier, nitrogen can have a significant positive effect on the level and rate of soil respiration. Increases in soil nitrogen have been found to increase plant dark respiration, stimulate specific rates of root respiration and increase total root biomass. and nitrogen supply over four years of growth. Global Change Biology. 6, 13-24. This is because high nitrogen rates are associated with high plant growth rates. High plant growth rates will lead to the increased respiration and biomass found in the study. With this <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>productivity,</b> an increase in soil activities and therefore respiration can be assured.|$|E

2500|$|How {{exactly the}} average {{industrial}} rate of profit will evolve, is either uncertain and unpredictable, {{or it is}} historically contingent; {{it all depends on}} the specific configuration of costs, sales and profit margins obtainable in fluctuating markets with given technologies.
