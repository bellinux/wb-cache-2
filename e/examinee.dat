Methods: Th e research was conducted in the period between November 2009 and April 2010 and involved 180 <b>examinees</b> of both genders, aging between 30 and 80 years of age with the diagnosis of arterial hypertension. Th e <b>examinees</b> were divided into two groups: control group consisting of <b>examinees</b> without hypertension crisis (95 <b>examinees)</b> and experimental group consisting of <b>examinees</b> with hypertensive crisis (85 <b>examinees).</b> Descriptive statistical methods were used in the statistical data processing.

25|$|The name item {{response}} {{theory is}} due to the focus of the theory on the item, as opposed to the test-level focus of classical test theory. Thus IRT models the response of each <b>examinee</b> of a given ability to each item in the test. The term item is generic: covering all kinds of informative item. They might be multiple choice questions that have incorrect and correct responses, but are also commonly statements on questionnaires that allow respondents to indicate level of agreement (a rating or Likert scale), or patient symptoms scored as present/absent, or diagnostic information in complex systems.|$|E
25|$|The Benton Test {{has been}} criticized by test's {{requirement}} of the examinee's IQ or estimated IQ, which {{can be difficult to}} obtain if the <b>examinee</b> is in a poor condition. In addition, data from studies that look at the viability of retesting a patient have shown conflicting results; some studies show no difference in scores after time has passed between two tests, while other studies show a difference. Despite these reports, the Benton Test has several advantages over other tests of visual memory. These include: a more explicit scoring system than other tests, parallel-forms reliability due to the presence of multiple form sets, and short administration time. Because of this, the BVRT is still widely used today for a large number of clinical conditions.|$|E
25|$|Knox set out {{to address}} the first problem, in his article {{published}} in the November issue of the New York Medical Journal in 1913. In this paper, he put forth two new performance tests, that were not based on verbal or cultural knowledge. The Cube Imitation Test, also known as Knox Cubes, consisted of four large black cubes and one small black cube. The examiner moves the small cube slowly and deliberately in various patterns {{in relation to the}} larger four cubes. The <b>examinee</b> is asked to imitate the movements conducted by the examiner. Each trial increases in difficulty and complexity. He also introduced a form board test (called the Geographical Puzzle, or “G” Test), which involved fitting pieces into proper places on a board, requiring both motor coordination as well as decision making. He believed that together these two tests could determine with increased accuracy whether an emigrant was mentally deficient, as neither required specific cultural knowledge for successful performance.|$|E

The patient note is slightly different from a standard SOAP note. For the exam note, the <b>examinees</b> will document the pertinent facts relating {{to the history of}} present illness as well as elements of the past medical history, medication history, allergies, social history, family history, and physical exam. The <b>examinees</b> will then state up to 3 differential diagnoses relating to the simulated patient's symptoms, and tests or procedures to investigate the simulated patient's complaints. The <b>examinees</b> should also list pertinent positive and negative findings to support each potential diagnosis. The <b>examinees</b> will not recommend any specific treatments in the note in contrast to a true clinic SOAP note (i.e., IV fluids, antibiotics, or other medications). Over the course of an 8-hour exam day, the <b>examinees</b> complete 12 such encounters. <b>Examinees</b> are required to type patient notes on a computer.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the amount of time}} spent on pretest and operational items that are answered correctly and incorrectly by different ability <b>examinees</b> when taking a computerized adaptive test (CAT). Consistent with other research, the results indicate that higher ability <b>examinees</b> spend more time than lower ability <b>examinees</b> on all items, regardless of whether the items are tailored to their ability level (operational items) or not (pretest items). It was expected, based on the literature, that <b>examinees</b> would spend more time on test questions they answered incorrectly than correctly. This was the case for most of the items, but not the ones near the end of the CAT, suggesting that <b>examinees</b> may not have sufficient time or motivation to devote to these items. ^ Seven testing fairness issues related to a CAT were addressed along with recommendations. Five test-taking strategies derived from the results were provided to help ensure testing fairness. The presence of pretesting was found either to benefit or hinder <b>examinees</b> depending on their ability levels due to disproportionate amounts of time and effort used by these <b>examinees</b> with different ability levels on these items. Generally, <b>examinees</b> with lower ability levels have more time remaining after they finish the test than do <b>examinees</b> with higher ability levels. ^ A design feature for a CAT that uses a time management wizard, time reminder, and pacing guidance to help examines to move through a test was proposed for future development. Finally, several recommendations to ensure testing fairness were provided for the future examiners’ manual. ...|$|R
