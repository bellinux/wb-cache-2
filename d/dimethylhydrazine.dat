5|$|The {{addition}} of the extra docking port caused {{the adoption of the}} Almaz-derived twin-chamber propulsion system first used on Salyut 3 and 5, with the two engine nozzleseach producing 2.9kilonewtons of thrustmounted peripherally {{on either side of the}} aft port. Salyut 6 introduced a Unified Propulsion System, with both the engines and the station's control thrusters running on unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> and nitrogen tetroxide, drawn from a common set of pressurized tanks, allowing the refueling capabilities of the visiting Progress tankers to be exploited to the maximum effect. The entire engine and fuel storage assembly was contained within an unpressurized bay at the rear of the station, which was the same diameter as the main pressurized compartment. However, the replacement of the Soyuz engine used on previous stations with the bay meant that the station kept a similar overall length to its predecessors. The main engines could not be fired if the rear docking port was in use, hence any orbital maneuvers during this time had to be performed by the visiting spacecraft.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{variants}} of hydrazine {{that are used}} as rocket fuel are monomethylhydrazine, (CH3)NH(NH2) (also known as MMH), and unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine,</b> (CH3)2N(NH2) (also known as UDMH). These derivatives are used in two-component rocket fuels, often together with dinitrogen tetroxide, [...] N2O4. These reactions are extremely exothermic, and the burning is also hypergolic (it starts burning without any external ignition).|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} Redstone {{was fueled}} with a 75 percent ethyl alcohol 25 percent water solution, {{essentially the same}} propellants as the V-2, but the Jupiter-C first stage had used hydyne fuel, a blend of 60 percent unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) and 40 percent diethylenetriamine (DETA). [...] This was a more powerful fuel than ethyl alcohol, {{but it was also}} more toxic, which could be hazardous for an astronaut in a launch pad emergency. [...] Furthermore, hydyne had never been used with the new A-7 engine. [...] The Mercury-Redstone designers rejected hydyne and returned to the standard ethyl alcohol fuel. The lengthened propellant tanks were thus also necessary in lieu of using less powerful fuel.|$|E

50|$|Like ethylenediamine, DETA {{can also}} be used to sensitize nitromethane, making a liquid {{explosive}} compound similar to PLX. This compound is cap sensitive with an explosive velocity of around 6200 m/s and is discussed in patent #3,713,915. Mixed with unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> it was used as Hydyne, a propellent for liquid-fuel rockets.|$|E
50|$|Hydyne is {{a mixture}} of 60% {{unsymmetrical}} <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) and 40% diethylenetriamine (DETA), developed in 1957 at Rocketdyne for use in liquid-fuel rockets.

50|$|The {{most common}} hypergolic fuels, hydrazine, {{monomethylhydrazine}} and unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine,</b> and oxidizer, nitrogen tetroxide, are all liquid at ordinary temperatures and pressures. They are therefore sometimes called storable liquid propellants. They {{are suitable for}} use in spacecraft missions lasting many years. The cryogenity of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen limits their practical use to space launch vehicles {{where they need to}} be stored only briefly.|$|E
50|$|The {{second stage}} employs the Vikas engine and carries 41.5 tonnes (40 tonnes till C-5 mission) of liquid propellantunsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) as fuel and {{nitrogen}} tetroxide (N2O4) as oxidiser. It generates a maximum thrust of 800 kN (724 till C-5 mission). The engine is hydraulically gimbaled (±4°) to provide {{pitch and yaw}} control, while roll control is provided by two hot gas reaction control motors.|$|E
50|$|Aerozine 50 is a 50/50 mix {{by weight}} of {{hydrazine}} and unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH). Originally {{developed in the}} late 1950s by Aerojet General Corporation as a storable, high-energy, hypergolic fuel for the Titan II ICBM rocket engines. Aerozine continues in wide use as a rocket fuel, typically with dinitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizer, with which it is hypergolic. Aerozine 50 is more stable than hydrazine alone, and has a higher density and boiling point than UDMH alone.|$|E
50|$|Unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH; 1,1-dimethylhydrazine) is a {{chemical}} compound with the formula H2NN(CH3)2. It is a colorless liquid, with a sharp, fishy, ammoniacal smell typical for organic amines. Samples turn yellowish on exposure to air and absorb oxygen and carbon dioxide. It mixes completely with water, ethanol, and kerosene. In concentration between 2.5% and 95% in air, its vapors are flammable. It is not sensitive to shock. 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine (CH3NHNH(CH3)) {{is also known}} but is not as useful.|$|E
50|$|The actual rocket {{design is}} a liquid fuel rocket, {{generally}} believed {{to use a}} hypergolic combination of unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) as fuel, and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) as oxidizer. Once the fuel/oxidizer combination are fed into the missile, it could maintain a 'ready to launch' condition for several days, or even weeks, like the R-27 SLBM, in moderate ambient temperatures. A fueled Hwasong-10 {{would not have the}} structural strength to be safely land transported, so would have to be fueled at the launch site.|$|E
50|$|Still another {{process has}} been found for the {{production}} of TATB from materials that are surplus to military use. 1,1,1-trimethylhydrazinium iodide (TMHI) is formed from the rocket fuel unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) and methyl iodide, and acts as a vicarious nucleophilic substitution (VNS) amination reagent. When Picramide, which is easily produced from Explosive D, is reacted with TMHI it is aminated to TATB. Thus, materials that would have had to have been destroyed when no longer needed are converted into a high value explosive.|$|E
50|$|The R-27 Zyb was a submarine-launched {{ballistic}} missile {{developed by the}} Soviet Union and employed by the Soviet Navy from 1968 through 1988. NATO assigned the missile the reporting name SS-N-6 Serb. In the USSR, it was given the GRAU index 4K10. It was a liquid fuel rocket using a hypergolic combination of unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) as fuel, and nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) as oxidizer. Between 1974 and 1990, 161 missile launches were conducted, with an average success rate of 93%. Total production was 1800 missiles.|$|E
50|$|Other {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that eflornithine can still aid in some chemoprevention by lowering polyamine levels in colorectal mucosa, with additional strong preclinical evidence available for application of eflornithine in colorectal and skin carcinogenesis. This has made eflornithine a supported chemopreventive therapy specifically for colon cancer in combination with other medications. Several additional studies have found that eflornithine in combination with other compounds decreases the carcinogen concentrations of ethylnitrosourea, <b>dimethylhydrazine,</b> azoxymethane, methylnitrosourea, and hydroxybutylnitrosamine in the brain, spinal cord, intestine, mammary gland, and urinary bladder.|$|E
50|$|Dimethylamine is a {{precursor}} to several industrially significant compounds. It reacts with carbon disulfide to give dimethyl dithiocarbamate, {{a precursor}} to a family of chemicals widely used in the vulcanization of rubber. The solvents dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide are derived from dimethylamine. It is raw material {{for the production of}} many agrichemicals and pharmaceuticals, such as dimefox and diphenhydramine, respectively. The chemical weapon tabun is derived from dimethylamine. The surfactant lauryl dimethylamine oxide is found in soaps and cleaning compounds. Unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine,</b> a rocket fuel, is prepared from dimethylamine.|$|E
5000|$|Critics {{claim that}} Proton rocket fuel (unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH)) and debris created by Russia's space {{programme}} is poisoning areas of Russia and Kazakhstan. Residents claim that acid rain falls after some launches. Anatoly Kuzin, {{deputy director of}} the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center, has however denied these claims, saying: [...] "We did special research into the issue. The level of acidity in the atmosphere is not affected by the rocket launches and there is no data to prove any link between the illnesses Altai and the influence of rocket fuel components or space activity of any kind".|$|E
5000|$|NDMA is an {{industrial}} by-product or waste product of several industrial processes. Manufacturing of unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH), {{which is a}} component of rocket fuel that requires NDMA for its synthesis. Of more general concern, water treatment via chlorination or chloramination of organic nitrogen-containing wastewater {{can lead to the}} production of NDMA at potentially harmful levels. [...] Further, NDMA can form or be leached during treatment of water by anion exchange resins. [...] Finally, NDMA is found at low levels in numerous items of human consumption including cured meat, fish, beer, and tobacco smoke [...] It is, however, unlikely to bioaccumulate.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other members}} of the Universal Rocket family, the Proton-K was fuelled by Unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> and {{nitrogen}} tetroxide. These were hypergolic fuels which burn on contact, avoiding the need for an ignition system, and can be stored at ambient temperatures. This avoids the need for low-temperature-tolerant components, and allowed the rocket to sit on the pad fully fuelled for long periods of time. In contrast, cryogenic fuels would have required periodic topping-up of propellants as they boil off. The fuels used on the Proton, were, however, corrosive and toxic and required special handling. The Russian Government paid for the cleanup of residual propellent in spent stages that impact downrange.|$|E
50|$|MMH and its {{chemical}} relative unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) have a {{key advantage}} that they are stable enough {{to be used in}} regeneratively cooled rocket engines. The Apollo Lunar Modules used a one-to-one mixture of hydrazine and UDMH (called Aerozine 50, or A-50) as one part of the rocket fuel for lunar landings and takeoff: the rocket motors formed a hypergolic mixture of the hydrazines with liquid dinitrogen tetroxide as the usual oxidizer. (Otherwise, red fuming nitric acid works.) About three tons of mixed hydrazines and four and one half tons of the oxidizer were required for each landing, and about one-third of those amounts for the lunar take-off to orbit.|$|E
5000|$|Critics {{claim that}} Proton rocket fuel (unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH)) and debris created by Russia's space {{programme}} is poisoning areas of Russia and Kazakhstan. Clusters of cancers {{have been found}} in the Republic of Altai and residents claim that acid rain falls after some launches. Anatoly Kuzin, deputy director of the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center, has denied these claims, saying: [...] "We did special research into the issue. The level of acidity in the atmosphere is not affected by the rocket launches and there is no data to prove any link between the illnesses Altai and the influence of rocket fuel components or space activity of any kind".|$|E
50|$|The Jupiter-C and Juno I rockets {{used the}} same first-stage engines as the missile, but needed more thrust due to the {{increased}} size of the payload/warhead. With {{the use of the}} newly developed Hydyne, composed of a blend of 60% unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH) and 40% diethylenetriamine (DETA), the Jupiter-C and Juno I engines gained a 12% increase in thrust and higher specific impulse. The resulting fuel was not only more powerful fuel than alcohol, but also more toxic. The first Hydyne-powered Redstone R&D flight took place on November 29, 1956. After the three Jupiter C and six Juno I launches including the launch of America's first satellite, Explorer I), Hydyne was discontinued in favor of higher performing fuels.|$|E
50|$|In 1956, when Brezhnev {{decided to}} examine a uranium mine shaft, the {{visitors}} had a shortage of protective suits. Ryabenko wore none and received a high dose of radiation. On 24 October 1960 he got exposed to the toxic chemical unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine,</b> shortly after the Nedelin catastrophe, in which a ballistic rocket exploded on the launch pad. As a result, Ryabenko was hospitalized for two months with a heart attack. On 9 February 1961 he was with Brezhnev when their plane was attacked by hijacked French jet fighters above the Mediterranean Sea. On 23 March 1982, a platform with people collapsed above Brezhnev and his entourage at a factory near Tashkent. Both Brezhnev and Ryabenko received concussions.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1989, five separate, peer-reviewed {{studies of}} Alar and its {{chemical}} breakdown product, unsymmetrical <b>dimethylhydrazine</b> (UDMH), {{had found a}} correlation between exposure to the chemicals and cancerous tumors in lab animals. In 1984 and again in 1987, the EPA classified Alar as a probable human carcinogen. In 1986, the American Academy of Pediatrics urged the EPA to ban it. Well before the 60 Minutes broadcast, public concern had already led six national grocery chains and nine major food processors to stop accepting apples treated with Alar. Washington State growers had pledged to voluntarily stop using it (although tests later revealed that many did not). Maine and Massachusetts had banned it outright.|$|E
