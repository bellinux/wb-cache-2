The phase separation between spin-up and spin-down atoms is induced by the interplay of the spin-dependent harmonic confinement and the strong repulsive interaction between intercomponent fermions.

50|$|Human beings {{produce an}} {{obligatory}} ~100 watts of heat energy as a by-product from basic processes like pumping blood, digesting, breathing, biochemical synthesis and catabolism etc. This {{is comparable to}} a common incandescent light-bulb. Hence, if the body were perfectly <b>insulated,</b> <b>core</b> temperature would continue to increase until lethal core temperatures were achieved. Conversely, we are normally in surroundings that are considerably colder than body core temperature (37 degrees Celsius or 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and hence {{there is a large}} gradient for thermal energy flow from the core to the surroundings. Therefore, the body must ensure it can also minimize the loss of heat to around 100 watts, if it is to maintain core temperature. In short, the skin must be able to get rid of 100 watts of heat in relatively warm environments, but also ensure that it does not lose too much more than this in relatively cold environments.|$|R

40|$|In {{electrical}} power systems bolted short-circuits are rare and the fault usually involves arcing and burning; mostly the limit value of minimum short-circuit depends really on arcing-fault. In AC low voltage systems, the paper examines the arcing-fault branch circuits as weak points. Different protection measures are available against the arc-faults. A first measure that can guarantee a probabilistic protection is {{allowed by the}} adoption of overcurrent protective devices (OCPD), optimizing {{the design of the}} structure of the system and/or the coordination of protection. A well known complete protection is allowed by adopting are-fault circuit interrupters (AFCI) for the protection of branch circuits. The authors suggest a new complete protection allowed wiring the branch circuits, including particularly extension cords, with special power cables, protected by ordinary ground fault protective devices (GFPD).
