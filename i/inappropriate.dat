5|$|Although {{reports of}} {{poisoning}} in humans are rare, ingestion of ferric chloride {{can result in}} serious morbidity and mortality. <b>Inappropriate</b> labeling and storage lead to accidental swallowing or misdiagnosis. Early diagnosis is important, especially in seriously poisoned patients.|$|E
5|$|Concussion {{can result}} in changes in mood {{including}} crankiness, loss of interest in favorite activities or items, tearfulness, and displays of emotion that are <b>inappropriate</b> to the situation. Common symptoms in concussed children include restlessness, lethargy, and irritability.|$|E
5|$|Culturally <b>inappropriate</b> {{decision}} making: The Organisation is {{not designed}} to deal with cultural issues or complex social problems; the normal Indigenous decision-making processes and protocols such as consultation and input from family groupings are not structurally accommodated.|$|E
5|$|Shape {{has been}} {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the most critical properties for identifying members of an object category. Infants assume that objects that have the same shape also share a name. Shape plays an important role in both appropriate and <b>inappropriate</b> extensions.|$|E
5|$|Siltation {{during the}} rainy season due to soil erosion of the denuded hills and <b>inappropriate</b> {{agricultural}} practices flowing through the three feeder streams namely, the Gomukh, the Nag Pahar and Savitri.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} ESL-57 {{suffered from}} reliability issues, frequently caused {{by use of}} <b>inappropriate</b> amplification or being driven too hard. In the main, the diaphragm would arc from being overdriven, or the audio transformer would seize up from being exposed to excessive voltages.|$|E
5|$|West umpired his 5,000th Major League game on June 20, 2017. He is the 3rd umpire in MLB {{history to}} {{accomplish}} the mark. On August 9, 2017, West was suspended for three games after making <b>inappropriate</b> comments towards Adrian Beltre.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} sixty-one {{religious}} leaders in Washington, D.C. {{sent a letter}} to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Redskin's owner Daniel Snyder stating their moral obligation to join the Change the Mascot movement due to the offensive and <b>inappropriate</b> nature of the name which causes pain whether or not that is intended.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the Chinese authorities found that the plant had been lacking any major safety features and was severely below regulation benchmarks, with the direct cause of the accident being attributed to <b>inappropriate</b> use of substandard equipment. The investigation also concluded that the various other safety failings at the facility were contributing factors. The report went on to criticize safety standards all throughout the Chinese steel industry.|$|E
5|$|Additional key {{threatening}} {{processes that}} are considered likely to impact the bristle-faced free-tailed bat include the alteration to natural flow regimes, competition from introduced western honey bees (Apis mellifera) for tree hollows, <b>inappropriate</b> fire regimes, reduction of invertebrate prey related to pesticide drift and lack of tree regeneration due to overgrazing and weeds.|$|E
5|$|Another {{clinical}} {{and public health}} concern is the proliferation of substandard antimalarial medicines resulting from <b>inappropriate</b> concentration of ingredients, contamination with other drugs or toxic impurities, poor quality ingredients, poor stability and inadequate packaging. A 2012 study demonstrated that roughly one-third of antimalarial medications in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa failed chemical analysis, packaging analysis, or were falsified.|$|E
5|$|Between 1995 and 2004 {{there were}} 2,630 {{accidents}} involving GA aircraft, of which 139 were fatal, {{resulting in the}} loss of 317 lives. The majority of accidents involved small fixed-wing aircraft engaged in private flights, and analysis attributes the most common causes of these to: flight handling skills; poor judgement or airmanship; lack of training or experience; and omission of, or <b>inappropriate,</b> action.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of playing fields in the valleys, many rugby teams would share grounds, travel every week to away grounds or even play on <b>inappropriate</b> (e.g. sloping) pitches. The valley clubs also had no clubhouses, with most teams meeting, and changing, in the closest local public house. Many more clubs, built around {{colliery}} and pub teams, appeared and disbanded but many of the clubs survive to this day.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is {{based on the idea that}} minors are innocent and exposure to <b>inappropriate</b> media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially <b>inappropriate</b> material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 a {{group of}} 61 {{religious}} leaders in Washington, D.C., {{sent a letter to}} NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and team owner Dan Snyder stating their moral obligation to join the Change the Mascot movement due to the offensive and <b>inappropriate</b> nature of the name which causes pain whether or not that is intended.|$|E
5|$|In North Africa and the Middle East, the Daily Show was {{broadcast}} on Showtime Arabia starting in 2008 and ending in 2015. When the show transitioned under Noah, OSN {{decided to wait}} a bit before airing the new show. Now, the Global Edition of Noah's show is broadcast on OSN's Comedy Central HD channel. Episodes are often edited if they contain topics deemed <b>inappropriate</b> for the region.|$|E
5|$|In October 2017, the U.S. State Department's {{inspector}} general investigated complaints that Brown had made <b>inappropriate</b> comments to women during a diplomatic {{visit to the}} Samoan capital of Apia. Brown said that cultural differences led to the investigation. The investigation centered around allegations that Brown had made two female United States Peace Corps volunteers feel uncomfortable.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, many {{traditional}} houses are being reconstructed and owners lured to come back, thus revitalizing tourism {{as a potential}} revenue source for the local economy. However, some houses continue to degrade from lack of investment, abandonment or <b>inappropriate</b> renovations as local craftsmen {{are not part of}} these projects.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the {{increasing}} wealth of middle class merchants and traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy, {{and threatened to}} break {{down some of the}} symbolic barriers between the nobility and the lower classes. The response came in two forms: didactic literature warning of the dangers of adapting a diet <b>inappropriate</b> for one's class, and sumptuary laws that put a cap on the lavishness of commoners' banquets.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, 1945 Justice LeBel issued {{his report}} that {{essentially}} exonerated Drew and Blackwell. Due to Jolliffe presenting only circumstantial evidence that linked Drew to Dempster, Murray and Sanderson, the Commissioner found the information unconvincing, even though LeBel believed Dempster's interaction with Sanderson and Murray was <b>inappropriate.</b>|$|E
5|$|RSTs {{may also}} have a public health benefit. In {{addition}} to undesirable side-effects in the individual, <b>inappropriate</b> antibiotic use is thought {{to contribute to the}} development of drug-resistant strains of bacteria. By helping to identify bacterial infection, RSTs may help to limit the use of antibiotics in viral illnesses, where they are not beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Studies have {{suggested}} a strong association exists between an increased {{body mass index}} {{and the development of}} plantar fasciitis in the non-athletic population; this association between weight and plantar fasciitis has not been observed in the athletic population. Achilles tendon tightness and <b>inappropriate</b> footwear have also been identified as significant risk factors.|$|E
5|$|Surgical {{excision}} of aphthous ulcers has been described, {{but it is}} an ineffective and <b>inappropriate</b> treatment. Silver nitrate has also been used as a chemical cauterant. Apart from the mainstream approaches detailed above, there are numerous treatments of unproven effectiveness, ranging from herbal remedies to otherwise alternative treatments, including aloe vera, myrtus communis, Rosa damascena, potassium alum, zinc sulfate, nicotine, polio virus vaccine and prostaglandin E2.|$|E
5|$|The Bank in Winterthur and the Toggenburger Bank {{merge to}} form the Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft. Its French name is Union de Banques Suisses (UBS) and its Italian name is Unione di Banche Svizzere (UBS). The English name of the bank at first is Swiss Banking Association. In 1921 that {{somewhat}} <b>inappropriate</b> name is changed into Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS).|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons' neighbors, the Winfields, {{decide to}} {{relocate}} because of Homer's regular <b>inappropriate</b> behavior. Bart and Lisa explore the Winfields' house {{while it is}} empty and up for sale, but Bart scares Lisa away from the basement with stories. Bart turns around to see his new neighbor, Laura Powers. Surprised, he falls down in shock and is helped back up by her and the pair become acquainted. Bart instantly develops a crush on her.|$|E
5|$|The {{fallout from}} these tests was {{measured}} using sticky paper, air sampling devices, and water sampled from rainfall and reservoirs. The radioactive cloud from Buffalo 1 (One Tree) reached a height of , exceeding the predicted , and radioactivity was detected in South Australia, Northern Territory, New South Wales, and Queensland. All four Buffalo tests were criticised by the 1985 McClelland Royal Commission, which concluded that they were fired under <b>inappropriate</b> conditions.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{probably}} favours calcareous soil, {{although it}} has been found on nearly every soil type. It appears on sand, peat, limestone soils, rankers and Cambisols. It endures acidic as well as alkaline and low-nutrient to relatively high-nutrient soils. Heavily eutrophic soils are <b>inappropriate</b> for its habitat.|$|E
5|$|To appease {{those who}} {{considered}} her sex {{to be the}} most serious obstacle, Maria Theresa assumed masculine titles. Thus, in nomenclature, Maria Theresa was archduke and king; normally, however, she was styled as queen. No 18th-century commentary saw this crossing of gendered titles as <b>inappropriate</b> or impossible.|$|E
5|$|Vertigo {{refers to}} the <b>inappropriate</b> {{perception}} of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal. The displaced otolith rests on the cupola, causing a sensation of movement when there is none. Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result {{in the perception of}} vertigo.|$|E
5|$|Written by Ben Aaronovitch, {{this story}} {{concerned}} privatisation. This idea was submitted in May 1987, the then script editor Andrew Cartmel liked {{some of the}} concepts, but he {{felt that it was}} generally <b>inappropriate</b> for Doctor Who, and that there were too many supporting characters. However, Andrew Cartmel encouraged Ben Aaronovitch to pitch more stories, and led to the story Remembrance of the Daleks.|$|E
5|$|About 1% of school-age {{children}} and adolescents have Tourette's. It was once considered a rare and bizarre syndrome, most often associated with coprolalia (the utterance of obscene words or socially <b>inappropriate</b> and derogatory remarks), but this symptom is present in only {{a small minority of}} people with Tourette's. The condition was named by Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) on behalf of his resident, Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette (1857–1904), a French physician and neurologist, who published an account of nine patients with Tourette's in 1885.|$|E
5|$|Although Watts {{received}} many offers {{to buy the}} painting, he had agreed to donate his most important works to the nation and felt it would be <b>inappropriate</b> not to include Hope. Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold the original and donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for private sale.|$|E
5|$|Although most printed sources, Harvey (1903), Olszewski (1971), Torres (1984), and the Historic Structure Report (2004), {{refer to}} the {{original}} 1884 inscriptions, the National Geodetic Survey (2015) refers to both the 1884 and 1934 inscriptions. All sources print them {{according to their own}} editorial rules, resulting in excessive capitalization (Harvey, Olszewski, and NGS) and <b>inappropriate</b> line breaks. No printed source uses cursive writing, although pictures of the apex clearly show that it was used for both the 1884 and 1934 inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|As an {{intoxicated}} Holly displays erratic {{behavior at}} Heidi and Spencer's rehearsal dinner, Stephanie is dismayed by {{her lack of}} irresponsibility. After Spencer explains that her behavior was <b>inappropriate,</b> Holly tearfully leaves the restaurant. The next morning, she apologizes to Heidi for her actions, and confirms that an invitation has been sent to a special guest. Charlie later tells Spencer that he invited Stacie, the bartender that Heidi clashed with for flirting with Spencer, to the wedding. Meanwhile, Brody and Stephanie make peace at Lauren and Lo's farewell party, while Lauren tells Stephanie that {{she will not be}} attending the ceremony.|$|E
