It was the world's third biggest aid donor in 2009 after the United States and France.|$|E
5|$|The primary duty of {{the foreign}} {{ministry}} was directing the general line of Soviet foreign policy. The MER represented the country abroad and participated in talks with foreign delegations {{on behalf of the}} Soviet government. It also appointed diplomatic officers, with the exception of Soviet ambassadors, who were appointed by the Council of Ministers. The MER was responsible for taking care of the USSR's economic and political interests abroad, although economic interests were also the <b>joint</b> <b>responsibility</b> of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The State Committee of the Council of Ministers on Cultural Links with Foreign Nations and the Ministry of Culture worked jointly with the MER in regards to the protection of Soviet citizens abroad, the exercise of overall Soviet consular relations abroad and the promotion of Soviet culture abroad. A less visible {{duty of the}} MER was its role in the coordination of Soviet intelligence operations abroad.|$|E

50|$|A common Ministerial Council {{ruled the}} common government: it {{comprised}} the three ministers for the <b>joint</b> <b>responsibilities</b> (<b>joint</b> finance, military, and foreign policy), the two prime ministers, some Archdukes and the monarch. Two delegations of representatives (60-60 members), one each from the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments, met separately and voted on the expenditures of the Common Ministerial Council giving {{the two governments}} influence in the common administration. However, the ministers ultimately answered only to the monarch who had the final decision on matters of foreign and military policy.|$|R

Many senior administrators are academics who have advanced degrees and no longer teach or conduct research.|$|R

The FTC is active in {{enforcement of}} the Robinson-Patman Act and the Department of Justice is not.|$|R

The United Kingdom still however controlled the military forces, foreign affairs and had a <b>joint</b> <b>responsibility</b> in internal security under agreement.

Supporters of the reforms point to broad support for them among Moroccan society, especially among women, and cite the new law as a successful example of a progressive reform framed in indigenous, Islamic principles. Critics of the reforms point to the elitist roots of the movements that advocated for the reforms, the influence of Western secular principles, and the many barriers to the law’s implementation within Moroccan society.|$|E
25|$|Lying {{within the}} {{boundaries}} of Lancashire since the early 12th century, Westhoughton was a chapelry and township in the ecclesiastical parish of Deane, in the Salford hundred. In 1837, Westhoughton joined with other townships (or civil parishes) to form the Bolton Poor Law Union and took <b>joint</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the administration and funding of the Poor Law in that area. In 1872, a Local board of health was established for the township, but was superseded in 1894 by the creation of Westhoughton Urban District which shared local government responsibilities with Lancashire County Council. In 1898 most of Over Hulton became part of the urban district.

500|$|Hardman {{made two}} major {{changes to the}} {{structure}} of the Air Force to streamline command and control: integrating RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, [...] with the Department of Air, and supplanting the geographical area commands with three functional organisations, namely Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands. The functional command system has been described by historian Alan Stephens as Hardman's [...] "major legacy to the RAAF". While doing away with the area command structure that had been favoured by Jones, Hardman carried on his predecessor's support for the local aircraft industry. He also formed a policy agreement with the Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Sir John Collins, covering <b>joint</b> <b>responsibility</b> and cooperation for maritime warfare. During Hardman's term as CAS, No.78 (Fighter) Wing was re-equipped with RAF deHavilland Vampire jet fighters to garrison Malta and support British operations in the Mediterranean.

The suitability of plant species for soil bioengineering, for example, had not been implemented in Singapore prior to this, and thus had to be tested - this was done through a year-long survey at the test reach (see Techniques).
