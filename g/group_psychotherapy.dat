25|$|Social {{group work}} and <b>group</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> have {{primarily}} developed along parallel paths. Where {{the roots of}} contemporary <b>group</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> are often traced to the group education classes of tuberculosis patients conducted by Joseph Pratt in 1906, the exact birth of social group work {{can not be easily}} identified (Kaiser, 1958; Schleidlinger, 2000; Wilson, 1976). Social group work approaches are rooted in the group activities of various social agencies that arose {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century and the early years of the 20th century. Social upheaval and new found demands as a result of post Civil War industrialization, migration and immigration created many individual and societal needs (Brown, 1991; Kaiser, 1958; Middleman, 1968; Reid, 1991; Schwartz, 1977; Wilson, 1976). Some of these needs were met through group work endeavors found in settlement houses as well as religious and charity organizations (Middleman, 1968; Wilson, 1976). Additionally group work could be found in the progressive education movement (Dewey, 1910), the play and recreation movement (Boyd, 1935), informal education, camping and youth service organizations invested in 'character building' (Alissi, 1980; Schwartz, 1977; Williamson, 1929; Wilson, 1976).|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom <b>group</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> {{initially}} developed independently, with pioneers S. H. Foulkes and Wilfred Bion using {{group therapy}} as {{an approach to}} treating combat fatigue in the Second World War. Foulkes and Bion were psychoanalysts and incorporated psychoanalysis into group therapy by recognising that transference can arise not only between group members and the therapist but also among group members. Furthermore, the psychoanalytic concept of the unconscious was extended with a recognition of a group unconscious, in which the unconscious processes of group members could be acted out {{in the form of}} irrational processes in group sessions. Foulkes developed the model known as group analysis and the Institute of Group Analysis, while Bion was influential in the development of group therapy at the Tavistock Clinic.|$|E
25|$|An early {{development}} in group therapy was the T-group or training group (sometimes {{also referred to}} as sensitivity-training group, human relations training group or encounter group), a form of <b>group</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> where participants (typically, between eight and 15 people) learn about themselves (and about small group processes in general) through their interaction with each other. They use feedback, problem solving, and role play to gain insights into themselves, others, and groups. It was pioneered in the mid-1940s by Kurt Lewin and Carl Rogers and his colleagues as a method of learning about human behavior in what became the National Training Laboratories (also known as the NTL Institute) that was created by the Office of Naval Research and the National Education Association in Bethel, Maine, in 1947.|$|E
25|$|<b>Group</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> {{is a key}} {{component}} of milieu therapy in a therapeutic community. The total environment or milieu is regarded as the medium of therapy, all interactions and activities regarded as potentially therapeutic and are subject to exploration and interpretation, and are explored in daily or weekly community meetings. However, interactions between the culture of group psychotherapeutic settings and the more managerial norms of external authorities may create 'organizational turbulence' which can critically undermine a group's ability to maintain a safe yet challenging 'formative space'. Academics at the University of Oxford studied the inter-organizational dynamics of a national democratic therapeutic community over a period of four years; they found external steering by authorities eroded the community's therapeutic model, produced a crisis, and led to an intractable conflict which resulted in the community's closure.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND The {{negative}} symptoms of schizophrenia significantly impact on {{quality of life}} and social functioning, and current treatment options are limited. In this study the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of <b>group</b> body <b>psychotherapy</b> as a treatment for {{negative symptoms}} were compared with an active control. DESIGN A parallel-arm, multisite randomised controlled trial. Randomisation was conducted independently of the research team, using a 1 [*]:[*] 1 computer-generated sequence. Assessors and statisticians were blinded to treatment allocation. Analysis was conducted following the intention-to-treat principle. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, a health and social care perspective was adopted. PARTICIPANTS ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA age 18 - 65 years; diagnosis of schizophrenia with symptoms present at >[*] 6 months; score of ≥[*] 18 on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative symptoms subscale; no change in medication type in past 6 weeks; willingness to participate; ability to give informed consent; and community outpatient. EXCLUSION CRITERIA inability to participate in the groups and insufficient command of English. SETTINGS Participants were recruited from NHS mental health community services in five different Trusts. All groups took place in local community spaces. INTERVENTIONS Control intervention: a 10 -week, 90 -minute, 20 -session group beginners' Pilates class, run by a qualified Pilates instructor.

2500|$|Mentalization based treatment, {{developed}} by Peter Fonagy and Antony Bateman, {{rests on the}} assumption that people with BPD have a disturbance of attachment due to problems in the early childhood parent-child relationship. [...] Fonagy and Bateman hypothesize that inadequate parental mirroring and attunement in early childhood lead to a deficit in mentalization, [...] "the capacity to think about mental states as separate from, yet potentially causing actions"; in other words the capacity to intuitively understand the thoughts, intentions and motivations of others, and the connections between one's own thoughts, feelings and actions. Mentalization failure is thought to underlie BPD patients' problems with impulse control, mood instability and difficulties sustaining intimate relationships. Mentalization based treatment aims to develop patients' self-regulation capacity through a psychodynamically informed multi-modal treatment program that incorporates <b>group</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> and individual psychotherapy in a therapeutic community, partial hospitalization or outpatient context. In a randomized controlled trial, a group of BPD patients received 18 months of intensive partial-hospitalization MBT followed by 18 months of <b>group</b> <b>psychotherapy,</b> and were followed up over five years.
