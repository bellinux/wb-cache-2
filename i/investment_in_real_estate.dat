In addition, the study identifies and evaluates current aspects and future trends <b>in</b> institutional <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> – taking into account the specific institutional governance structure in Germany.

Thereafter, the study focuses on the behaviour of German institutional investors and their tendency to convert direct <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> assets into indirect <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> investments. This possible conversion is evaluated in regards to new investment forms such as mortgage/asset backed securities, <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> private equity/opportunity funds and fund of funds products as well as the likely introduction of <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>investment</b> trusts (REITs) <b>in</b> Germany, but also in regard to the actual crises at the openended <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> fund market <b>in</b> Germany.
