25|$|Article 64 of the Danish Constitution {{guarantees}} the personal independence of judges by protecting them from removal and transfer {{by the administration}} by vesting the power to remove judges in the courts themselves. Removal may only take place in instances of <b>gross</b> <b>misconduct</b> or lasting physical or psychological illnesses. Such dismissals are decided by The Special Court of Indictment and Revision, which consists of one judge each from the Supreme Court, the High Court, and the County Court.

25|$|On October 21, 1991, two Members of Parliament, Labour MP George Galloway and Conservative MP Rupert Allason (who writes spy novels {{under the}} {{pseudonym}} Nigel West) agreed {{to raise the}} issue in the House of Commons, which enabled newspapers to claim privilege and report the allegations. Nick Davies was subsequently fired from the Daily Mirror for <b>gross</b> <b>misconduct.</b> Robert Maxwell issued a writ for libel against Faber and Faber and Seymour Hersh, allegedly telling Davies that the Mirror editor had threatened to resign if Davies was not fired, but that he would get his job back when the dust settled.|$|E
25|$|The courts enjoy legal, {{financial}} and constitutional freedom guaranteed by Ukrainian law since 2002. Judges are largely well protected from dismissal (except in the instance of <b>gross</b> <b>misconduct).</b> Court justices are appointed by presidential decree for an initial period of five years, after which Ukraine's Supreme Council confirms their positions for life. Although {{there are still}} problems, the system is considered to have been much improved since Ukraine's independence in 1991. The Supreme Court is regarded as an independent and impartial body, and has on several occasions ruled against the Ukrainian government. The World Justice Project ranks Ukraine 66 out of 99 countries surveyed in its annual Rule of Law Index.|$|E

25|$|Pulis {{then joined}} Gillingham {{in the summer}} of 1995, whom he managed for a further four seasons, turning a team that had {{struggled}} at the very bottom of the Football League into a promotion winning one in his first season, and laying the foundations for the club's eventual elevation to the First Division {{for the first time in}} their history. In the 1999 Second Division play-off final, the Gills were 2–0 up with less than two minutes left, following goals by the prolific partnership of Robert Taylor and Carl Asaba, only to see Manchester City score twice, the equaliser in injury time, and after that win a penalty shoot-out 3–1. Following the defeat, Pulis was controversially sacked by the club amidst claims of <b>gross</b> <b>misconduct.</b> He later brought a £400,000 court case against Gillingham chairman Paul Scally for unpaid bonuses, which was settled out of court in 2001 for £75,000.|$|E
25|$|Within months, Saavedra was {{promoted}} to Vice President of production and soon was producing and/or supervising the production/development of numerous projects including Only You (starring Academy Award winner Helen Hunt and directed by Betty Thomas), <b>Gross</b> <b>Misconduct</b> (Jimmy Smits and Naomi Watts), Scorchers (Faye Dunaway, James Earl Jones, Jennifer Tilly, Emily Lloyd), The Real Macaw (Jason Robards), At First Sight (Jonathan Silverman), Closer and Closer (Kim Delaney) and the television series The Man from Snowy River. In 1993, the company {{changed its name to}} Becker FilmWorks Entertainment to reflect its ties with parent company Becker Entertainment, Australia's leading independent film and television production, distribution and exhibition company. Shortly thereafter, Saavedra was named President of the Los Angeles operations. In 1999, Saavedra made his directorial debut on the feature comedy-drama Rhapsody In Bloom (Penelope Ann Miller, Ron Silver, Craig Sheffer and Caroline Goodall). After directing Rhapsody in Bloom, Saavedra retired from Becker FilmWorks to focus on writing both motion picture and theatrical works.|$|E
25|$|He, perhaps inadvertently, did {{introduce}} a key reform, {{which turned out}} to be his most important and most enduring of his legacies. It was his policy to administer the Shan states, which had constantly raided Upper Burma since the late 13th century. The king permitted the saophas of the states to retain their royal regalia and ceremonies, and feudal rights over their subjects. The office of the saopha remained hereditary. But the incumbent saopha could now be removed by the king for <b>gross</b> <b>misconduct</b> although the king's choice of successor was limited to members of the saopha's own family. The key innovation was that he required sons of his vassal rulers to reside in the palace as pages, who served a dual purpose: they were hostages for good conduct of their fathers and they received valuable training in Burmese court life. His Shan policy was followed by all Burmese kings right up to the final fall of the kingdom to the British in 1885.|$|E
50|$|Sullivan {{presided over}} the 2008 trial of Senator Ted Stevens, {{who was convicted of}} ethics {{violations}} in October of that year. The judge initially refused requests by the defense for a mistrial to be declared, after information was revealed that the prosecution had withheld material. But in April 2009, Sullivan set aside the conviction following a Justice Department probe that found additional evidence of <b>gross</b> prosecutorial <b>misconduct.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 2008, Stevens was {{embroiled in}} a federal {{corruption}} trial as he ran for re-election to the Senate. He was found guilty, and eight days later was narrowly defeated at the polls. Stevens is the most senior U.S. Senator to have ever lost a reelection bid. However, prior to sentencing, the indictment was dismissed—effectively vacating the conviction—when a Justice Department probe found evidence of <b>gross</b> prosecutorial <b>misconduct.</b> Many have argued the prosecution was unfair and politically motivated.|$|R
25|$|FitzGerald's {{government}} {{lasted until}} January 1982 when it collapsed {{due to a}} controversial budget which proposed the application of Value Added Tax to children's shoes, previously exempt. FitzGerald, no longer having {{a majority in the}} Dáil, went to Áras an Uachtaráin to advise President Hillery to dissolve the Dáil and call a general election. However, the night the government collapsed the Fianna Fáil Front Bench issued a statement encouraging the President not to grant the dissolution and to allow Fianna Fáil to form a government. Phone calls were also made to the President by Brian Lenihan. Haughey, on attempting to contact his former colleague the President, and on failing to be put through to him, was reported to have threatened the President's aide de camp by telling him that he would be Taoiseach one day and when that happened, I intend to roast your fucking arse if you don't put me through immediately. Hillery considered such pressure to be <b>gross</b> <b>misconduct,</b> and granted the dissolution.|$|E
25|$|Bayinnaung {{considered}} {{control of}} the Shan states of utmost strategic importance for his hold of the upcountry. Raids by nearby highland Shan states had been an overhanging concern for successive lowland regimes since the 14th century. The most feared were Mohnyin and Mogaung, the twin Shan states, which led most of the raids. Bayinnaung introduced a key administrative reform, {{which turned out to}} be his most important and most enduring of his legacies. The king permitted the sawbwas to retain their feudal rights over their subjects. The office of the sawbwa remained hereditary. But the incumbent sawbwa could now be removed by the king for <b>gross</b> <b>misconduct</b> although the king's choice of successor was limited to members of the sawbwa's own family.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the current}} {{civil war in}} the Republic of theSudan’s [RoS] western region of Darfur within the broad context of the country’s age-old crisis of governance at the national level; conditioned by the inequitable State’s policies of the central state and its dominant Arab elite. Using Frost’s [1996] identified ‘settled’ body of norms in international relations to probe Sudan’s conducts in domestic and international politics, this paper found Khartoum guilty of <b>gross</b> <b>misconducts</b> and violations of international humanitarian law [IHL]. These deviant behaviours, rooted in its quest to establish a theocratic state and export its radical ideology overseas, have pitted the RoS with the wider international community. Drawing from Khartoum’s current military engagements in Darfur and previous similar operations, this study contends strongly that for Sudan to come out of its present political hiccup, its rulers must jettison its lopsided policies in preference for the ones that are inclusive of all ethnic formations in the country with sincerity of purpose. In the final analysis, it is argued that this can onlybecomes meaningful within the context of improved socio-economicconditions. This, stricto sensus, calls for the Africa’s development partners and the wider international community’s economic support to Sudan...|$|R
50|$|On November 8, the quarter-finals {{took place}} at the WJAC. Canada East took on Team Germany. The Germans scored early in the game and held a 1-0 lead for most of the game. In the third period, the East scored four {{unanswered}} goals to defeat the German squad by a score of 4-1. In the other quarter-final, the Canada West squad played against the Belorussians. The West came up with an early 2-0 lead in the game. The Belorussians scored in the second to make it 2-1. Early in the third, Belarus tied the game at 2. Belarus started taking untimely penalties and Pittsburgh Penguins' prospect Casey Pierro-Zabotel scored a natural hat trick in only 4 minutes and 2 seconds. Two of Pierro-Zabotel's goals were on the power play and the three goals made the score 5-2. The game ended with a final score of 7-3 for Canada West and a series of serious penalties (<b>gross</b> <b>misconducts</b> and match penalties) for both squads. Canada East and Canada West moved on to the WJAC semi-finals, while Germany and Belarus will play in the 5th Place Match early on November 10.|$|R

500|$|Tony Pulis {{took over}} in 1995, with Gillingham {{once again in the}} bottom division, and managed the club to {{promotion}} in his first season in charge. Three years later he led the team to the Second Division play-off final, but was sacked immediately after this after being accused of <b>gross</b> <b>misconduct.</b> [...] Peter Taylor replaced him and took the club to a second consecutive play-off final, where Gillingham gained promotion to the second tier of English football for the first time. [...] In 2013 Martin Allen became the second manager to lead the Gills to a divisional title in the Football League, as the team won the championship of League Two.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{play-off}} loss, Pulis was sacked for <b>gross</b> <b>misconduct,</b> with Peter Taylor replacing him as manager.

500|$|The main {{charge against}} Robeson was taking {{financial}} favors from Alexander Cattell & Co., a grain contractor, {{in exchange for}} giving the company profitable contracts from the Navy. [...] An 1876 Naval Affairs committee investigation found Robeson to have received such gifts as a team of horses, Washington real estate, and a $320,000 vacation cottage in Long Branch, New Jersey, from Alexander Cattell & Company. [...] The same company also paid off a $10,000 note that Robeson owed to Jay Cooke and offered itself as an influence broker for other companies {{doing business with the}} Navy, thus turning away any competitive bidding for naval contracts. Robeson was also found to have $300,000 in excess to his yearly salary of $8000. The House Investigation committee had searched the disorganized books of Cattell, but found no evidence of payments to Robeson. Without enough evidence for impeachment, the House ended the investigation by admonishing Robeson for <b>gross</b> <b>misconduct</b> and claimed that he had set up a system of corruption known as Cattellism.|$|E

2500|$|A {{few days}} after the {{military}} invasion of Iraq, O'Brien sent March 25, 2003 an explicit letter to US Catholic military chaplains, writing [...] "Given the complexity of factors involved, many of which understandably remain confidential, it is altogether appropriate for members of our armed forces to presume the integrity of our leadership and its judgments, and therefore to carry out their military duties in good conscience (nota : [...] "our leadership" [...] is not referring to the Pope)... It is to be hoped that all factors which have led to our intervention will eventually be made public, and... will shed helpful light upon our President's decision". Knowing to be a target for Catholic war opponents as increasingly distancing himself from the Pope's sayings and from some statements expressed at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops ("A preemptive war against Iraq is an unjust war"), O'Brien wrote this letter without endorsing the motives of the war. However, it is acknowledged that the proponents of the Iraqi war cause were comforted by his positions. Nevertheless, after the war has started, his spiritual direction proved to be efficient in helping calm the doubts of soldiers, advising them that they can safely leave the responsibility for moral decision-making to the Government. On several occasions, US Army chaplains including O'Brien were asked by Catholics [...] "to call on all Catholic soldiers to leave Iraq" [...] : O'Brien gave flat refusals for discussions. O'Brien thinks that, to make Just War, the role of chaplains becomes essential to help soldiers perform their fighting duties, to ease relationships with local populations and to avoid <b>gross</b> <b>misconducts</b> (such as torturing in the Abu Ghraib prison). In such a context, O'Brien is often complaining that the paucity of priests serving in active duty in the US Army is nearing disaster.|$|R
500|$|The next {{significant}} {{manager of}} Gillingham was Archie Clark, under whose management the club {{returned to the}} Football League in 1950, having been voted out in 1938. [...] Freddie Cox was the first manager {{to win a major}} trophy with Gillingham, taking the Football League Fourth Division championship in the 196364 season. Under his successor, Basil Hayward, the club was relegated back to the Fourth Division in the 197071 season, but Andy Nelson led the club to promotion back to Division Three three years later. [...] After the Gills were relegated once again in the 198889 season, Tony Pulis managed the club to promotion seven years later. [...] Pulis also took the team to the final of the play-offs for promotion to the second tier of English football in the 199899 season. [...] Pulis was sacked immediately after this for <b>gross</b> <b>misconduct,</b> but his successor, Peter Taylor, took the club back to the play-off final the following season, in which victory over Wigan Athletic saw the club promoted to Division One {{for the first time in}} its history. Peter Taylor left to join Leicester during the close season and club captain Andy Hessenthaler took over as manager for the club's first, and to date only, stint in the second tier.|$|E
500|$|Watts {{then took}} a year off to travel, visiting Los Angeles and being {{introduced}} to agents through Kidman. Encouraged, Watts {{decided to move to}} America, to pursue her career further. In 1993 she had a small role in the John Goodman film Matinee and temporarily returned to Australia to star in three Australian films: another of Duigan's pictures, Wide Sargasso Sea; the drama The Custodian; and had her first leading role in the film <b>Gross</b> <b>Misconduct,</b> as a student who accuses one of her teachers (played by Jimmy Smits) of raping her. Watts then moved back to America for good but the difficulty of finding agents, producers and directors willing to hire her during that period frustrated her initial efforts. Though her financial situation never led her to taking a job out of the film industry, she experienced problems like being unable to pay the rent of her apartment and losing her medical insurance. [...] "At first, everything was fantastic and doors were opened to me. But some people who I met through Nicole , who had been all over me, had difficulty remembering my name when we next met. There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely, but Nic gave me company and encouragement to carry on." ...|$|E
500|$|On 13 May, on {{the final}} day of the season, with QPR {{requiring}} at least a draw in their match away at Manchester City or for Bolton Wanderers to not win in order to guarantee Premier League safety, Barton was sent off in the 55th minute for violent misconduct after elbowing Carlos Tevez in the face. Immediately after being shown a red card, he kicked Sergio Agüero in the back of the knee and attempted to head-butt Vincent Kompany. Barton had to be dragged from the pitch by former teammate Micah Richards as he rowed with Manchester City players and staff and attempted to square-off with striker Mario Balotelli. QPR went on to concede two late goals and lose the match 3–2, but avoided relegation due to Bolton's draw at Stoke City. Barton commented after the match saying that he was trying to [...] "take [...] of their players with me." [...] The FA responded by issuing two charges of violent conduct against him, for the kick and the attempted head-butt, the initial foul already carrying with it a charge of violent conduct. Barton accepted the charge for kicking Agüero but denied the charge for attempting to head-butt Kompany. QPR also began an internal investigation into his behaviour, amid speculation that he would be stripped of the captaincy and fined and possibly shown the door by the club either by being sold, released on a free transfer or having his contract terminated for <b>gross</b> <b>misconduct.</b>|$|E

2500|$|On May 29, 2007, the Anchorage Daily News {{reported}} that the FBI and {{a federal grand jury}} were investigating an [...] "extensive" [...] remodeling project at Senator Ted Stevens' home in Girdwood, Alaska.

[...] Shortly thereafter, the US Supreme Court ruled that the honest services fraud statute was drafted with unconstitutional vagueness and could only cover [...] "fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who has not been deceived." [...] Since Clark's awareness of the poll constituted neither bribes or kickbacks, all charges against him were voided. Moreover, due to misdeeds on behalf of the federal prosecutors in their [...] "Polar Pen" [...] operation, the prosecutors themselves were later investigated and found guilty of <b>gross</b> prosecutorial <b>misconduct</b> in the Ted Stevens case.|$|R
