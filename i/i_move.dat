500|$|Waldron's own {{assessment}} of his style {{was that it}} was partly a reflection of his personality: [...] "It's part of my personality to be very economical with what I have and to use it in all variations before <b>I</b> <b>move</b> to the next set of notes". He acknowledged the influences of Holiday (on his conception of space and playing behind the beat), Mingus (for the importance of individuality), and Roach (on the value of time signatures other than the usual 4/4), as well as pianists Duke Ellington, Monk, Powell and Art Tatum.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is a [...] "heartbroken ballad", where Spears {{declares}} on the introduction, [...] "You tell me you're {{in love with me}} / That you can't take your pretty eyes away from me / It's not that I don't wanna stay / But every time you come too close <b>I</b> <b>move</b> away". According to musicologist Melanie Lowe, [...] "Spears shows a different side of her personality [...] than she does in her other songs." [...] Both of them also commented the song [...] "lacks rhythmic drive and the backing track is fuller, with smoother and rounder synthsized instruments", while describing Spears' vocals as more natural when compared to [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy".|$|E

500|$|Photos of Parks and Recreation {{producers}} {{were included}} among {{the photos of}} past city council members on the town hall walls. The photo of Norm Hiscock is the one Leslie said she believes, [...] "No matter what direction <b>I</b> <b>move,</b> he's always staring at my chest. Mark's social networking site featured in [...] "Boys' Club" [...] included the character {{with a wide range}} of promiscuous women. The pictures were shot during a photo session during which, according to series co-creator Michael Schur, [...] "We brought in a lot of women and basically said, you're really trashy. You're trashy women, and we're going to take your picture now." [...] During the courtyard party scenes, a brief clip shows Poehler, Jones and Schneider dancing together. The clip was actually the three actors out-of-character playing around between takes, but the Parks producers decided to add it to the episode.|$|E
500|$|While commenting {{in regards}} to the lyrical content of the song on Australian talk show, Rove, Gaga said that she was unrepentant about her [...] "disco stick" [...] metaphor, though it led to a banning of the music video on Network Ten in Australia. She added that the metaphor was not meant to be subtle and was clear what the lyrics {{constituted}} off. [...] "If anything, I happen to think people are frivolously hard on me", Gaga generalized. She went on to relegate [...] "lot of youth-oriented pop music" [...] as much racier than hers with their sexually provocative lyrics, but Gaga felt that the whole context of her visuals alongside the music was what made people react. [...] "It's the music in relation to the visual, in relation to the way <b>I</b> <b>move</b> and the way I articulate the lyrics. But if I wanted to make music to make people sing 'la di da' that would be very boring," [...] she concluded.|$|E
500|$|The booklet {{contains}} outdated {{discussions of}} health and well-being. Other notes in the booklet, dealing with life and death reflections, {{seem to be more}} personal, like a message typed on one of the last pages, supposedly referring to the loss of a loved one ("I waited all day. You waited all day...but you left before sunset...and I {{just wanted to tell you}} the moment was beautiful. Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me."). The booklet also displays some poems or original sayings not belonging to the songs' lyrics, but to be interpreted as a commentary to the songs and, again, as a reflection on how life should or shouldn't be lived. An example is the poem typed on the [...] "Aye Davanita" [...] page. The song's subtitle is [...] "The song without words", as it is an instrumental track. But the page displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of [...] "intruder words" [...] is on the [...] "Not for You" [...] lyrics page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the Sisyphus myth ("Yeah, you call me Sisyphus love. Yeah, <b>I</b> <b>move</b> the rock. I just don't want to talk about moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock"). The lyrics to [...] "Whipping" [...] are written on a copy of a petition to Bill Clinton against [...] "pro-life" [...] killings of abortion doctors. An X-ray of Vedder's teeth was pictured instead of lyrics on the page for [...] "Corduroy".|$|E

500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble <b>I</b> <b>move</b> it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E
500|$|Spears {{originally}} envisioned [...] "Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary", {{but felt}} {{all right with}} her label's producers, since [...] "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me." [...] The album opens with the first single [...] "...Baby One More Time", a teen pop and dance-pop song that begins with a three-note motif in the bass range of the piano. The opening was compared to many other songs, such as [...] "We Will Rock You" [...] (1977), [...] "Start Me Up" [...] (1981), [...] "These Words" [...] (2004) and the theme song of the film Jaws {{due to the fact}} the track [...] "makes its presence known in exactly one second". According to magazine Blender, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] is composed by [...] "wah-wah guitar lines and EKG-machine bass-slaps". Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, authors of Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide (2008), observed that the lyrics of the song [...] "gesture toward [...] longing for the return of an ex-boyfriend." [...] The next song and third single, [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] runs through a moderately slow dance beat, and has a rhythm and blues melody mixed with edgy synthesized instrumentals. The third track and second single [...] "Sometimes" [...] is a ballad, that Spears begins with [...] "You tell me you're in love with me/That you can't take your pretty eyes away from me/It's not that I don't wanna stay/But every time you come too close <b>I</b> <b>move</b> away". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted the song has [...] "a catchy hook and endearing melody, with a reminiscent euro-dance rhythm." ...|$|E

[...] Clinton had made a similar motion during the 2008 convention roll call; however, Sanders (unlike Clinton in 2008) did not move to nominate Clinton by acclamation. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.|$|E

And <b>I</b> <b>move</b> along {{at a rate that}} doesn’t give them too much of a chance to think." [...] Bee Vang said that he originally felt fright, but was able to ease into the acting.

2500|$|Discussing sexual perversion, Scruton {{argues that}} its [...] "major {{structural}} feature" [...] is the [...] "complete or partial failure to recognise, {{in and through}} desire, the personal existence of the other", {{which in turn is}} [...] "an affront, both to him and oneself." [...] Scruton calls perversion, [...] "narcissistic, often solipsistic". In his chapter on perversion, Scruton considers masturbation, bestiality, necrophilia, pedophilia, sado-masochism, homosexuality, incest, and fetishism. Scruton argues that there are two forms of masturbation, and only one is perverted. Scruton argues that homosexuality is significantly different from heterosexuality, and that this helps to explain the traditional judgment that homosexuality is a perversion. Heterosexuality involves dealing with the different and complementary nature of the opposite sex, whereas homosexuality does not: [...] "Desire directed towards the other gender elicits not its simulacrum but its complement." [...] Scruton writes that, [...] "In the heterosexual act, it might be said, <b>I</b> <b>move</b> out from my body towards the other, whose flesh is unknown to me; while in the homosexual act I remain locked within my body narcissistically contemplating in the other an excitement that is the mirror of my own." [...] Scruton dismisses the classical scholar Kenneth Dover's Greek Homosexuality (1978) as [...] "trivialising" [...] and faults Michael Levin's arguments for the abnormality of homosexuality, calling them absurd. In Scruton's view, normal sexuality involves not only giving recognition to the other's person in and through desire for him or her, but also according them accountability and care in the process. Scruton argues that sex is morally permissible only if it involves love and intimacy.|$|E
2500|$|Leonard Woolf {{wrote about}} Sackville-West, who, as an aristocrat, {{came from a}} very {{different}} world than {{he and his wife}} : [...] "She [...] belonged indeed to a world which was completely different from ours, and the long line of Sackvilles, Dorsets, Da La Warrs and Knole with its 365 rooms had put into her mind and heart an ingredient which was alien to us and at first made intimacy difficult". While Sackville-West was visiting Nicholson in Tehran, Woolf wrote to her: [...] "Then there's my character (you see how egoistical I am, for I only answer questions that are about myself), I agree with the lack of jolly vulgarity. But then think about how I was brought up! No school, mooning about alone among my father's books, never a chance to pick up all that goes on in the schools-throwing balls: ragging: slang: vulgarity: scenes: jealousies: only rages with my half brothers and being walked off my legs round the Serpentine by my father". In her reply, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "But indeed, my upbringing wasn't so different from yours: <b>I</b> <b>move</b> about too, at Knole mostly, and haven't had a brother or sister to knock the corners off me. And I never went to school. If I am jolly and vulgar, you can cry quits on another count, for you have that interest in humanity which I can never manage-at least I have the interest, but not the diabolical skill in its practice which is yours. As I get older...I get more and more disagreeably solitary". Besides for having similar childhoods, both women had grown up with a profound sense of the weight of English history as Woolf's father Sir Leslie Stephen had been a leading contributor to The Dictionary of National Biography while Sackville-West had grown up at Knole House, one of the grand country houses of England. Likewise, Sackville-West had felt torn between her Spanish heritage which contrasted with the English grandeur she had been brought up in at Knole House while Woolf felt torn between the [...] "sobriety" [...] of her father's family vs. the [...] "flamboyance" [...] of her mother's family.|$|E
2500|$|Winchester was {{respected}} by the others professionally, {{but at the}} same time, as a Boston blue blood, he was also snobbish, as when he stated in the scrub room, [...] "I do one thing at a time, I do it very well, and then <b>I</b> <b>move</b> on," [...] which drove much of his conflict with the other characters. Still, the show's writers occasionally allowed Winchester's humanity to shine through, such as in his dealings with a young concert pianist who had partially lost the use of his right hand, the protection of a stuttering soldier from the bullying of other soldiers (it is revealed later that Winchester's sister Honoria stutters), his keeping a vigil with Hawkeye when Hawkeye's father went into surgery back in the States ("Sons and Bowlers"), his willingness to be officer of the day for Hawkeye when Hawkeye was offered three days in Seoul, giving blood to a patient even though he already donated blood five days earlier, or his continuing a family tradition of anonymously giving Christmas treats to an orphanage. Winchester subjects himself to condemnation after realizing that [...] "it is sadly inappropriate to offer dessert to a child who has had no meal." [...] Isolating himself, he is saved by Klinger's own gift of understanding. Klinger scrapes together a Christmas dinner for Charles, with the provision that the source of the gift remain anonymous (Klinger had overheard Winchester's argument with the manager of the orphanage). For the final moment of the episode ("Death Takes a Holiday"), the two are simply friends as Charles says, [...] "Thank you, Max," [...] and Klinger replies, [...] "Merry Christmas, Charles." [...] As well, in the series finale [...] "Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen", Charles comes across a group of Chinese musicians who surrender to him. When Charles takes them back to the camp as prisoners of war and later listens to his record of Mozart's [...] Quintet in A major for Clarinet and Strings, K. 581, the musicians attempt to play the piece of music. Charles, ever the perfectionist, cannot stand to hear them play the piece incorrectly (and is impressed that they can even attempt to play the music after only hearing it once) and spends the next week conducting them on how to play the piece properly. During this time, Charles is forced to use the little patience that he rarely shows. When the Chinese musicians are taken off to a prisoner of war camp in a prisoner exchange to Charles' dismay and protest, their final goodbye to Charles is the Mozart piece played correctly. Later, one of the musicians returns to the camp mortally wounded on a Jeep. When Charles inquires as to where the other musicians are, it's revealed that the truck the musicians were on was ambushed and that there were no other survivors. In a combination of shock and disbelief, Charles returns to The Swamp to listen to the Mozart record, but removes the record and smashes it in anger. Later still on the final night that everyone at the M*A*S*H is together, Charles says that before the war, music was a stress reliever to him, but because of the Chinese musicians and their fate, music will forever be a reminder of the horrors of war.|$|E
