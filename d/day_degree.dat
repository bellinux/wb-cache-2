40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis was {{to find out the}} growers’ perspective towards the problem of apple sawfly (Hoplocampa testudinea, Klug) as well as its solution, evaluate the suitability of Dutch and Swiss forecasting methods in Swedish environment, and evaluate the efficiency and timing of Quassia extract application with varying concentration of rapeseed oil product Zence 40 against the apple sawfly. The apple sawfly was monitored using white sticky traps in two orchards located in Alnarp and Malmö. The forecasting models for emergence of first sawfly (Dutch model) and egg hatch (Swiss model) were combined and used for determining timing of Quassia extract application. The model worked well for forecasting both the first emergence and egg hatch of the apple sawfly. A field trial was conducted for spraying Quassia extract as a control measure against the apple sawfly. The treatments were 1) Petal fall (PF), 2) <b>Day</b> <b>degree</b> low zence (DDL), 3), <b>Day</b> <b>degree</b> high zence (DDH) and 4) Control (C). The dose of Quassia was used at 12 kg per hectare in 400 liters of water. The percentage of the apple sawfly damage was significantly lower in all treatments compared to control with 3. 8 %, 3. 2 %, 2. 9 % and 9. 9 % damage in treatment 1, 2, 3 and 4. There was no difference in secondary damage between treatments. This could have been influenced by a large aphid infestation at that time. Semi structured face to face interviews were carried out to get deeper understanding of the problem. Older orchards were found to have relatively more infestation compared to new orchards. The growers were interested to continue the work with monitoring and trap catches in the coming season. They wished that the model should be proposed which can be used by the advisors from Äppelriket and the Board of Agriculture for forecasting the apple sawfly in Sweden...|$|E

The aim this study is to investigate further the impact of antibiotics on co-morbidities post tonsillectomy. Methods: This prospective double blinded randomized controlled study was conducted at the department of otolaryngology in a ter-tiary care hospital where 300 tonsillectomy operations are performed each year. All Patients aged 2 years and older who were admitted for elective tonsillectomy from Janu-ary 2012 to December 2012 were included in this study. Results: From the 128 patients enrolled in the study, 70 belonged to Group A (Intervention) and 50 to Group 2 (Control).

Ethylene biosynthesis, as well as transcript accumulation of the hormone biosynthetic enzymes (MdACS 1 and MdACO 1), receptors (MdETR 1 and MdERS 1) and {{an element of the}} transduction pathway (MdCTR 1), were evaluated in apples borne by trees with high (HL) and low (LL) fruit load. Orchards were located in two localities differing in elevation and season <b>day</b> <b>degree</b> sum.

Trees from the low elevation (LE) bloomed and the fruit ripened earlier than those from the high elevation (HE), displaying also a shortened fruit developmental cycle. Dynamics of ethylene evolution was apparently not affected by elevation. The onset of ethylene evolution started 130 days after bloom (DAB) at both elevations. During early ripening, fruits from LL trees produced significantly more ethylene than those from HL trees. Expression analysis of MdACS 1, MdACO 1 and MdERS 1 indicated that the transcript accumulation well correlated with ethylene evolution.

Methods: We extended the Peto-Lopez smoking impact ratio method to estimate accumulated hazards of smoking for different regions of the world. Lung cancer mortality data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease mortality database. The American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study, phase 11 (CPS-II) with follow up for the years 1982 to 1988 was the reference population. For the global application of the method, never-smoker lung cancer mortality rates were chosen based on the estimated use of coal for household energy in each region. Results: Men in industrialised countries of Europe, North America, and the Western Pacific had the largest accumulated hazards of smoking. Young and middle age males in many regions of the developing world also had large smoking risks. The accumulated hazards of smoking for women were highest in North America followed by Europe. Conclusions: In the absence of detailed data on smoking prevalence and history, lung cancer mortality provides a robust indicator of the accumulated hazards of smoking.

40|$|The {{ability to}} store {{different}} insect stadia for prolonged periods provides considerable flexibility {{and ability to}} conduct experiments properly. Therefore, studies were undertaken {{to determine the effect}} of storage temperature and duration on viability of eggs of Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner). The percentage egg hatch and incubation period were significantly (P = 0. 01) influenced by egg age, storage temperature, and storage duration. Egg hatch ranged from 0. 0 to 96. 8 % across temperatures and storage durations. None of the eggs hatched when stored at x 20 and 0 C. The regression model with the optimum Mallow Cp statistic for any of the identified linear and quadratic terms did not improve the precision of prediction in egg hatch beyond 67. 0 %. Forecasting of incubation period based on egg age, storage duration, and durationrtemperature was quite effective (R 2 = 84. 2 %). Day degrees required for egg hatching decreased with an increase in temperature from 10 to 27 C, and egg age from 0 to 3 days. The <b>day</b> <b>degree</b> requirements were highest for 0 -day-old eggs at 10 C, and lowest at 27 C. Although the incubation period was higher, the hatchability was lower for 0 - and 1 -day-old eggs stored at constant 10 C, these eggs can be stored for 10 days at 10 C, with a hatchability of> 75. 0 %. It was safer to store the H. armigera eggs for 10 days at 10 C, which will hatch within 1. 6 to 2. 0 days after restoration at 27 C with a hatchability of> 75. 0 %. This information will be useful in planning and execution of experiments involving H. armigera on various aspects of research in entomology...|$|E
40|$|Seed tuber {{physiological}} age {{is known to}} influence a range of important growth processes in potato including early vigour of the plant, stem number per plant, hence tuber size distribution, time to emergence and the rate and duration of canopy cover rate of the plant. There is also an indication in published {{evidence to suggest that}} the expression of the seed tuber {{physiological age}} effects is modified by planting environment and varies with genotype. Furthermore, current process-based potato models do not capture the effect of the seed tuber physiological age and the interaction with planting environment. This reflects the lack of understanding and quantification of the effect of physiological age on potato growth. This thesis reports on physiology studies to investigate the effect of seed tuber physiological age and planting environment on stem number and component processes of pre-emergent growth and canopy development for important commercial cultivars of potato. The resultant findings are incorporated into a process-based potato model. Investigation of a production dataset collected from commercial potato paddocks in northern Tasmania showed that tuber size distribution was correlated with stem number per plant. The investigation also showed that planting environment (i. e. location, sowing date and soil type) varied with stem number. A follow-up controlled-environment trial provided further confirmation of the interaction between seed tuber physiological age and planting environment and that the response varies with genotype. Currently, the lack of any reliable measure of physiological seed age makes it difficult to develop response functions that can be incorporated into process-based models. With this in mind, a study was conducted to explore the possibility of using mitotic index as an indicator for tuber sprouting pattern as affected by seed tuber physiological age. Physiologically older tubers were found to have a higher mitotic index than younger tubers. However, mitotic index of the eye bud cannot be used to explain the sprouting pattern of the seed tuber having different physiological ages. Sprouting pattern was controlled by a correlative inhibition and availability of soil water. Pre-emergent growth of sprouts after planting was characterised by an initial period of slow growth (lag phase) followed by rapid linear growth. The duration of the lag phase was strongly influenced by temperature. Linear growth of the longest sprout was significantly affected by the interaction between temperature and water potential and varied significantly between cultivars. Physiological age of the seed tubers was found to have a significant influence on the canopy development of potato. Plants grown from physiologically older tubers were characterized by more branching on the main stem nodes and smaller individual leaf size. Leaf appearance rate was affected significantly by seed physiological age with the response varying with cultivar. In Russet Burbank, leaves generated from physiologically older seed appeared at a faster rate (39. 5 °Cd per leaf or 0. 025 leaves per <b>day</b> <b>degree)</b> than leaves from physiologically younger seed tubers (51. 2 °Cd per leaf or 0. 02 leaves per <b>day</b> <b>degree).</b> No significant difference was found between treatments for Atlantic although the first leaf in plants from older seed reached full size earlier (46. 9 °Cd) than plants from younger seed tuber (75. 9 °Cd). Seed tuber physiological age did not significantly affect the leaf senescence rate. However, senescence commenced earlier in plants derived from older seed tubers. The results from the physiology studies were incorporated into a new process-based growth and development model for potato for use within the APSIM modeling framework. A conceptual model was developed for the relationship between seed physiological age, soil moisture and temperature conditions at sowing and stem number. The complete potato model (APSIM Potato) was calibrated for leaf and stem biomass, tuber yield and phenology against a dataset collected from commercial paddocks in northern Tasmania and then validated against a larger independent dataset (48 paddocks) covering a wide range of growing environments. The model was found to adequately predict tuber yield (R 2 = 80...|$|E

As the prevalence of smokers in EDs is higher compared with the population-level, aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate an ED-initiated tobacco control program in a natural setting. A randomized-controlled trial with overall 1012 ED-patients was conducted between October 2005 and December July 2008. At baseline study participants were asked for their smoking history (number of cigarettes smoked per <b>day,</b> <b>degree</b> of nicotine dependency, motivation to change smoking behavior and attempts to quit smoking during the last 12 months) and were further randomized stratified to age, sex and motivation to change smoking behavior. Half of patients got an emergency-initiated tobacco control program which consisted of one-site counseling plus up to 4 telephone booster sessions. Control got usual care. Follow-up interviews were conducted by telephone interview after 1, 3 and 6 months. Primary study outcome was the 7 -days-nicotine abstinence at 6 months. Analysis was by binary logistic regression. At baseline patients´ median age was 30 years and 39. 3 % were female. Overall 41. 9 % were very low nicotine-dependent, 23. 8 % were low and 34. 4 % were high or very high nicotine-dependent. At six months follow-up overall 17. 8 % of those reached were nicotine-abstinent and there was no difference between patients got ED-initiated tobacco control program and controls (19. 9 % vs. 16. 0 %, p= 0. 190). Patients in the ED-initiated tobacco control program smoked 7 cigarettes per day while controls smoked 10 cigarettes per day, p= 0. 001.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{effectiveness}} of a seedfly, Pegohylemyia jacobaeae (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) as a biological control agent of ragwort, Senecio jacobaea. Seedfly populations were sampled from October to April in 1982 / 83 and 1983 / 84 at two sites in the central North Island, New Zealand. Supplementary laboratory experiments were conducted to clarify aspects of the seedfly/ragwort interaction. In the field a six week pre-oviposition period was recorded before ragwort flowered. The absence of ragwort flowers had no effect on ovary development in laboratory reared flies but the pre-oviposition period predicted by a <b>day</b> <b>degree</b> summation model was shorter than that observed in the field. The extended pre-oviposition period resulted in competition for oviposition sites when ragwort first flowered, with consequent low fecundity and multiple oviposition. This competition was higher in the second year due to a tenfold increase in the number of flies emerging compared with the previous year. The total number of ragwort seedheads was similar in both years but inflorescence development was faster in 1983 / 84. A combination of increased seedfly population, increased competition for oviposition sites and improved synchrony between emergence and ragwort flowering in 1983 / 84 resulted in a twofold increase in infestation levels compared to 1982 / 83. Estimates of seedfly mortality within the seedhead were 33 % and 60 % in 1982 / 83 and 1983 / 84 respectively but were affected by the variable length of the third larval instar. Laboratory and field data indicated that pupating third instar larvae leave the seedhead in conditions of high surface moisture and prolonged dry conditions resulted in high mortality. Pupal mortality ranged from 14. 3 to 57 % but this was also affected by estimates of third instar larvae. Pupal diapause is initiated at temperatures above 15 - 20 C and in the central North Island seedfly rarely diapause in winter. Seedfly infestation levels ranged from 10 % (1982 / 83) to 20 % (1983 / 84) and up to 200 seedheads/m 2 escaped predation. Ragwort seeds are long-lived, have a high germinating capacity, and uneaten seeds from seedfly infested seedheads were viable.

40|$|The {{study of}} insect {{dispersal}} plays {{an essential role}} in estimating the spread of damage caused by a newly invaded pest or the spatial distribution of an insect during the active period in growing season. Moreover concerning dispersal, quantitative information performs {{a crucial role in the}} evaluation and implementation of pest control. Since rearing clean and healthy insects in sufficient numbers is the most important prerequisite for many basic research programs and for developing pest control strategies, mass rearing of the Codling moth on the artificial diet carried out as the first step at optimum conditions. With regard to the fundamental function of feeding and pre-releasing handling on insect biological attributes, we intended to evaluate the individual marking influence on longevity of Codling moths in the next step. For this purpose, one day old adult male and female moths were kept three and five minutes at - 20 °C to make them motionless, then immediately marked individually with felt tip pens and coded by the different colors, maintained under optimum condition and checked daily for 13 days. The proposed linear model accounted for 89 % of the variations. Numbing and marking process influenced of the moths longevity regardless of their sex while the duration of the anesthetize does not affect the survival of moths meaningfully. Regarding the obstacles associated with egg and pupa storage of Codling moth, we examined the possibility of adult moth?s storage in low temperature in order to evaluate its e&# 64256;ect on longevity of moths. Adult 12 - 24 h old male and female moths were treated separately and maintained in 4 &# 9702;C and (0 : 24 h, L:D) photoperiod during the entire adult life. The survival rate evaluated with two days interval throughout 27 days. The effects of day and treatment were significant. It seems that the female moths tolerate the cold condition better and further than the male moths and live longer. Additionally the proposed models accounted for 71 % and 57 % of the variations for male and females respectively as verified more affection and debility of the males by the storage condition. Disadvantages of individual marking led us to test the mass marking and it?s influence on the survival of the moths. One-day-old moths were marked with fluorescent powder. Mortality of the males and females recorded daily for a 20 days period. Results indicated that the effects of the sex, the replications and interaction of them were significant as well as the effect of the day. The model accounted for 96 % of the variations. This study indicated that male and female moths were in&# 64258;uenced by the &# 64258;uorescent powder. Findings of this study may facilitate the improvement of mark-release experiment results and interpretation more precisely in particular for dispersal studies. In the field experiments, firstly trade off trap structure in assessing the horizontal and vertical distribution of Codling moth carried out as well as outward and inward dispersal. Three different types of the traps including Delta pheromone traps, Delta Pear ester trap and Cylinder shape Pear ester traps were used in the research station of the Hohenheim University. Ninety six traps were suspended in eight compass directions in order of four traps per direction, at three heights in random arrangement in outward dispersal. In inward dispersal study the traps arrangement and number was the same but dissimilarly the releasing site was from borders of directions SW, NW, W, E, and SE. The traps were checked daily and followed nine days after release. Results demonstrated no significant differences between three types of traps in attracting the marked and feral females ?Fn?. Meanwhile significant dissimilarity in marked and feral male ?Mn? catches were traced. Reaction of the moths to the traps elevation was not similar in the vertical distribution study. whereas marked female moths exhibited significant differences to different heights, marked and feral male and ?Fn? moths revealed no difference reaction to traps in different heights. In horizontal distribution study marked female moths ?Fr? exhibited significant differences. It is revealed that dominant directions for marked and feral moths were different. Concerning inward distribution, both marked male ?Mr? and female demonstrated significant differences in their direction and distances. In regard to this findings and priceless and effortless manufacturing of the Cylinder traps, utilization of this trap in mark-release-recapture studies of female and male Codling moths is recommended. Effect of apple cultivar on pheromone and Pear ester trap efficiency studied as the next tread. In this experiment 32 Delta pheromone traps and 32 Cylinder-shape Pear ester traps impartially mounted on different varieties of apple trees. Artificially reared and marked 24 to 26 h old moths were released at 1 m height from a central point. Among the simple effects the most important explanatory variable for the response variables ?Mn? and ?Fn? moths was sampling dates of moths, while the variety and distance from the releasing point for ?Mn? and the variety and trap height for ?Fn? were the second and third influential variables respectively. Moreover among the nested effects the interaction of distance-height-variety was the most influential one for ?Mn? likewise the interactions of date, release point, direction and trap height with the variety were the most influential for ?Fn?. For the ?Mr? and ?Fr? moths releasing date was the most important influential variable, while the trap type and variety for ?Mr? and variety and trap height for the ?Fr? were the second and third influential variables respectively. Current study revealed that dispersal of the feral and marked-released male and female Codling moths influenced by host cultivars distinctly and decidedly. Meanwhile, quantifying these relationships and propose distinct model for marked and feral male and female moths are the exclusive characteristics of present findings. The next stage of present study related to study of climatic factors on dispersal of Codling moth. In this study, Hohenheim station climatic data were used. Several climatic elements including temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed in two different heights (2. 5 m and 10 m), <b>Day</b> <b>Degree,</b> twilight temperature, wind speed and precipitation were utilized in the analysis. Diversity and high number of variables led us to use AIC method for selecting of appropriate regressors and fitted model. The main regressors that inföuenced the ?Fr? were flight height, ageing, twilight wind speed (2. 5 m heights) and precipitation. For the ?Mr? the same regressors plus the distance from the releasing point were the best subset. In the case of the feral moths the flight height, relative humidity, <b>Day</b> <b>Degree,</b> twilight temperature and wind speed were the best subset regressors. Comprehensively we concluded that present study provides new knowledge in basic as well as in applied science. Twilight temperature, rainfall, wind speed and <b>Day</b> <b>Degree</b> impress the distribution of the moths in a superior way than the circadian weather data. This knowledge could mitigate confusion which arises from observations of erratic flight patterns and could lead to fewer treatment decision errors in the future. Also may accelerate and strengthen forecasting programs of this key pest as well as the related management tactics. The combination of mark-release-recapture and diffusion models have been shown to be effective for measuring insect dispersal. We attempted to measure the Codling moth dispersal using traps placed at different distances and heights. Diffusion coefficient calculated for horizontal and vertical dispersal of male and female moths distinctly using direct and indirect methods and resulting models were compared. We fitted the non-linear regression using the iterative process and estimating the parameters accuracy were tested according to the default asymptotic 95 % confidence intervals calculation in non-linear regression. Considering the overall models, suitability of three factors fitted models was more convincible than that of two factors model particularly for male moths. Meanwhile we found great difference in the diffusion coeffcient of direct and indirect methods. Regardless of the model type, the R 2 was relatively high in our experiments which evaluate how well the model fits data. We have shown that the diffusion model leads to powerful techniques for the analysis of dispersal data at least for one economically important insect. In conclusion, the present study provides an estimate of population spread by Codling moth using estimated rates of reproduction and dispersal, quantified the association between various key factors and Codling moth movement for the first time using the diffusion model. By including additional parameter to the diffusion model the predictive explanatory potential of this method was improved for dispersal studies at least for a cosmopolitan and critical insect. Untersuchungen zur Insektenverbreitung sind eine wichtige Grundlage für Voraussagen über das Vordringen eines neu eingewanderten Schädlings auf dem Luftweg oder die räumliche Verteilung eines Insekts während seiner aktiven Periode in der Anbausaison. Dar¨uber hinaus spielen quantitative Aussagen zur Verbreitung eine entscheidende Rolle in der Bewertung und Umsetzung von Pflanzenschutzmaßnahmen. Da die Aufzucht gesunder Insekten in ausreichender Zahl die wichtigste Voraussetzung für viele grundlegende Forschungsvorhaben und für die Entwicklung von Pflanzenschutzstrategien darstellt, war der erste Schritt die Massenzucht des Apfelwicklers auf künstlicher Diät unter optimalen Bedingungen. Aufgrund der erheblichen Auswirkungen von Fütterungs- und Handhabungsbedingungen auf die biologischen Eigenschaften der Insekten beabsichtigten wir, im nächsten Schritt den Einfluß der Markierung auf die Lebensdauer der Apfelwickler zu untersuchen. Dazu wurden einen Tag alte ausgewachsene männliche und weibliche Tiere drei und fünf Minuten einer Temperatur von - 20 °C ausgesetzt, um sie bewegungsunfähig zu machen, sofort mit verschiedenfarbigen Filzschreibern nach einem Farbschema individuell markiert und dann 13 Tage unter optimalen Bedingungen gehalten und täglich kontrolliert. Das vorgeschlagene lineare Modell deckt 89 % der Variationen ab. Der Einfluß des Betäubungs- und Markierungsvorgangs auf die Lebensdauer der Tiere war bei beiden Geschlechtern gleich, dabei hatte die Dauer der Betäubung keine entscheidenden Auswirkungen auf die Überlebensrate der Falter. Angesichts der Schwierigkeiten, Eier und Puppen des Apfelwicklers zu lagern, untersuchten wir die Möglichkeit, adulte Tiere bei niedriger Temperatur zu halten, um mögliche Auswirkungen auf die Lebensdauer der Insekten zu erfassen. Ausgewachsene 12 - 24 h alte männliche und weibliche Falter wurden getrennt behandelt und während ihrer gesamten Lebensdauer bei 4 °C und einer Photoperiode von (0 : 24 h, L:D) gehalten. Die Überlebensrate wurde 27 Tage lang jeden zweiten Tag erhoben. Der Zusammenhang von Lebensdauer und Behandlung war signifikant. Es scheint, daß die weiblichen Tiere Kälte besser ertragen als die männlichen und länger leben. Die vorgeschlagenen Modelle beschreiben jeweils 71 % bzw. 57 % der Variationen für Männchen und Weibchen und bestätigen höhere Anfälligkeit und Sterblichkeit der Männchen unter Lagerbedingungen. Nachteile der individuellen Markierungsmethode veranlassten uns, Massenkennzeichnungen und ihren Einfluß auf die Überlebensrate der Insekten zu untersuchen. Einen Tag alte Tiere wurden mit fluoreszierendem Puder gekennzeichnet, die Sterblichkeit von Männchen und Weibchen über zwanzig Tage täglich aufgezeichnet. Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, daß der Zusammenhang zwischen Geschlechtszugehörigkeit, den Wiederholungen, ihrem Zusammenwirken und dem Tag der Erhebung signifikant war. Das Modell beschrieb 96 % der Variationen. Der Versuch zeigte, daß männliche wie weibliche Falter durch den fluoreszierenden Puder beeinflusst werden. Die Ergebnisse der Untersuchungen können zur Verbesserung von Wiederfang-Versuchen beitragen und helfen, ihre Ergebnisse aussagekräftiger zu machen, insbesondere für Verbreitungsstudien. In den Freilandexperimenten wurde zuerst eine Anordnung von Fallen eingesetzt, um die horizontale und vertikale Verteilung der Apfelwickler sowie ihre Ausbreitungsdynamik zu erfassen. Drei verschiedene Arten von Fallen wurden auf der Versuchsstation der Universität Hohenheim verwendet: delta-Fallen mit Pheromon, delta-Fallen mit Birnenester und Zylinderfallen mit Birnenester. Um die auswärts gerichtete Ausbreitung zu erfassen, wurden sechsundneunzig Fallen in acht Himmelsrichtungen, vier in jeder Richtung, auf drei verschiedene H¨ohen zufällig verteilt angebracht. Die Anordnung zur Erfassung der einwärtigen Ausbreitung war gleich, aber die Freisetzung erfolgte an den in den Richtungen SW, NW, W, O, und SO gelegenen Grenzen der Versuchsfläche. Die Fallen wurden neun Tage nach der Freisetzung täglich überprüft. Die Ergebnisse zeigten keine signifikanten Unterschiede zwischen den drei Arten von Fallen in ihrer Anziehung auf markierte und wilde Weibchen 'Fn'. Zwischen den Fangraten an markierten und wilden Männchen 'Mn' ließ sich jedoch ein signifikanter Unterschied nachweisen. Die Reaktion der Falter auf die Höhe der Fallen über dem Boden war unterschiedlich. Während markierte weibliche Tiere signifikante Vorlieben für bestimmte Höhen aufwiesen, war bei markierten und wilden Männchen sowie wilden Weibchen kein Unterschied in der Reaktion auf verschieden hoch angebrachte Fallen zu erkennen. Bezüglich der horizontalen Ausbreitung zeigten markierte weibliche Falter 'Fr' signifikante Unterschiede. Es erwies sich, daß die bevorzugten Richtungen für markierte und wilde Apfelwickler-Motten unterschiedlich waren. Betreffs der migration Ausbreitung wiesen sowohl markierte Männchen 'Mr' als auch Weibchen signifikante Unterschiede in Richtung und Entfernungen auf. Angesichts dieser Ergebnisse sowie der billigen und einfachen Herstellung der zylindrischen Fallen wird ihre Anwendung in Wiederfang-Versuchen mit männlichen und weiblichen Apfelwicklern empfohlen. Im nächsten Schritt wurde der Einfluß von Wirtstypeen auf die Wirksamkeit der Pheromonund Birnenester-Fallen studiert. In diesem Versuch wurden 32 deltaFallen mit Pheromon und 32 Zylinderfallen mit Birnenester zufällig verteilt auf Apfelbäumen verschiedener Sorten angebracht. Im Labor aufgezogene und markierte 24 - 26 h alte Falter wurden an einem zentralen Punkt in 1 m Höhe freigelassen. Unter den einfachen Zusammenhängen war das Erhebungsdatum die Ausgangsvariable mit dem größten Einfluß auf die Ergebnisvariablen 'Mn' und 'Fn', an zweiter und dritter Stelle kamen Sorte und Entfernung vom Ort der Freilassung für 'Mn' bzw. Sorte und Höhe der Falle f¨ur 'Fn'. Unter den Zusammenhängen höherer Ordnung war das Zusammenwirken von Entfernung, Höhe und Sorte am einflußreichsten für 'Mn', dagegen jenes von Datum, Freisetzungtype, Richtung, Fallenhöhe und Sorte am wichtigsten für 'Fn'. F¨ur 'Mr' und 'Fr' war das Freilassungsdatum die bedeutendste beeinflussende Variable, während die Art der Falle und die Sorte für 'Mr' bzw. die Sorte und Fallenhöhe für 'Fr' den zweiten und dritten Rang einnahmen. Die vorliegende Studie zeigte auf, daß die Ausbreitung sowohl von wilden als auch markierten und freigelassenen männlichen wie weiblichen Apfelwicklern entscheidend und deutlich von den Wirtstypeen beeinflusst wird. Diese Verhältnisse werden erstmalig quantitativ beschrieben und ein geeignetes Modell für markierte wie wilde, männliche und weibliche Falter vorgeschlagen. Der nächste Abschnitt der vorliegenden Arbeit beschäftigte sich mit dem Einfluß klimatischer Faktoren auf die Ausbreitung des Apfelwicklers. Zu diesem Zweck wurden Daten der Meteorologischen Station Hohenheim verwendet. Verschiedene Klimafaktoren, wie Temperatur, Rel. Feuchte, Niederschlag, Windgeschwindigkeit in zwei verschiedenen Höhen (2, 5 m und 10 m), Gradtage und Dämmerungstemperatur gingen in die Analyse ein. Die Verschiedenheit und Vielzahl der Variablen veranlasste uns, die AIC-Methode zu verwenden, um angemessene Regressoren und ein passendes Modell zu finden. Die Hauptregressoren, welche die Variable 'Fr' beeinflussten, waren Flughöhe, Alter, Windgeschwindigkeit in der Dämmerung (2, 5 m Höhe) und Niederschlag. Bei 'Mr' bildeten dieselben Regressoren und zusätzlich der Abstand vom Ort der Freisetzung die beste Auswahl. F¨ur die wilden Falter stellten Flughöhe, Rel. Feuchte, Gradtag, Dämmerungstemperatur und Windgeschwindigkeit den besten Satz an Regressoren dar. Zusammenfassend ist festzustellen, daß die vorliegende Studie neue Einsichten für die angewandte wie auch die Grundlagenforschung bereithält. Dämmerungstemperatur, Regen, Windgeschwindigkeit und Gradtag bestimmen die Ausbreitung der Apfelwickler sehr viel stärker als das Wetter tagsüber. Diese Erkenntnis könnte die aus der Beobachtung unvorhersagbarer Flugaktivität herrührende Verwirrung verringern und in der Zukunft zu weniger Fehlentscheidungen über Behandlungsmaßnahmen führen. Sie kann außerdem Vorhersagen zum Auftreten dieses wichtigen Schädlings und damit Managementstrategien vereinfachen und absichern. Die Kombination von Wiederfang-Versuchen und Verteilungsmodellen hat sich als effektiv zur Bestimmung der Ausbreitung von Insekten erwiesen. Wir haben versucht, mit Hilfe von in verschiedenen Entfernungen und Höhen angebrachten Fallen die Ausbreitung des Apfelwicklers zu bestimmen. Die Verteilungskoeffizienten, berechnet jeweils für horizontale und vertikale Ausbreitung von weiblichen und männlichen Faltern unter Verwendung von direkten und indirekten Methoden sowie die resultierenden Modelle wurden verglichen. Mittels iterativer Methoden ermittelten wir eine passende nonlineare Regression und schätzten die Genauigkeit der Näherung unter Zugrundelegung eines 95 %-Vertrauensintervalls. Im Vergleich war ein auf drei Faktoren beruhendes Modell überzeugender als ein nur zwei Faktoren berücksichtigendes, insbesondere bezüglich männlicher Falter. Allerdings fanden wir große Unterschiede in den Verteilungskoeffizienten zwischen direkten und indirekten Methoden. Unabhängig von der Art des Modells war R 2 in unseren Versuchen, zu ermitteln, wie gut das Modell mit den Daten übereinstimmt, relativ hoch. Wir haben gezeigt, daß das Verteilungsmodell zur Analyse von Ausbreitungsdaten zumindest für ein wirtschaftlich bedeutendes Insekt ein leistungsfähiges Werkzeug darstellt. Schließlich stellt die vorliegende Studie unter Verwendung geschätzter Vermehrungsraten und Ausbreitungsgeschwindigkeiten eine Abschätzung der Ausbreitung des Apfelwicklers bereit und beschreibt unter Verwendung eines Verteilungsmodells erstmalig quantitativ den Zusammenhang zwischen verschiedenen Schlüsselfaktoren und Mobilität des Apfelwicklers. Durch Einbeziehung zusätzlicher Parameter für das Verteilungsmodell konnte das Potential dieser Methode für Erklärung und Vorhersage im Rahmen von Ausbreitungsstudien zumindest für ein weltweit vorkommendes und wichtiges Insekt verbessert werden...|$|E

50|$|The {{concepts}} of <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> and balance point temperature are interconnected. By summing {{the differences between}} the balance point temperature and the outdoor temperature over a period of time, the resultant value is degree-time. Use of daily mean temperature data in the summation results in <b>degree</b> <b>days,</b> although <b>degree</b> hours or even degree minutes may be possible depending upon the granularity of the data used. The <b>degree</b> <b>day</b> is often further broken down into heating <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> (HDD), in which energy will need to be spent to heat the space, and cooling <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> (CDD), in which the space will need cooling (either through an input of energy or by natural means). This is achieved by counting any positive difference between the balance point temperature and the outdoor air temperature as HDD, and either discarding the remaining data or considering them to be CDD. Although <b>degree</b> <b>days</b> are calculated based on recorded energy use in the building, the balance point temperature of the building determines whether a building will annually have more HDD or CDD. A low balance point temperature (relative to the local climate) indicates that the building {{will be more likely to}} need additional cooling, while a high balance point temperature indicates that it is more likely to need heating. Ideally, a building should be designed such that the balance point temperature is as near as possible to the average outdoor temperature of the local climate, which will minimize both the CDD and HDD.|$|R
