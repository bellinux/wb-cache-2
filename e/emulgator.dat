40|$|The {{objectives}} of the present work were to prepare castor oil-based nano-sized emulsion containing cationic droplets stabilized by poloxamer–chitosan <b>emulgator</b> film and to assess the kinetic stability of the prepared cationic emulsion after subjecting it to thermal processing and freeze–thaw cycling. Presence of cryoprotectants (5 %, w/w, sucrose + 5 %, w/w, sorbitol) improved the stability of emulsions to droplet aggregation during freeze–thaw cycling. After storing the emulsion at 4 °C, 25 °C, and 37 °C {{over a period of}} up to 6  months, no significant change was noted in mean diameter of the dispersed oil droplets. However, the emulsion stored at the highest temperature did show a progressive decrease in the pH and zeta potential values, whereas the emulsion kept at the lowest temperatures did not. This indicates that at 37 °C, free fatty acids were formed from the castor oil, and consequently, the liberated free fatty acids were responsible for the reduction in the emulsion pH and zeta potential values.

That to replace CH 4 from its hydrate with CO 2 {{is a new}} method that combibes energy exploitation with greenhouse gas sequestration. The intention to use CO 2 emulsion is to enhance the replacement by use of {{the properties of the}} emulsion, and to promote its practical application. The relations between the emulsification process and results and the operation parameters such as content of TMN- 6, mass ratio of CO 2 and water, pressure and stirring rate were investigated. A nonionic surfactant Tergitol TMN- 6 was used as <b>emulgator</b> and emulsion preparation was performed in an emulsifier of 350 ml. It is indicated by experiment that at 30 MPa and below 298 K, a CO 2 -in-water emulsion can be formed and can exist for about 10 h stably. The kinetic property of replacement of CH 4 from its hydrate with a series of CO 2 emulsions were investigated. The CH 4 hydrate used to be replaced was formed by refrigeration in the wetted quartz sand that in a cell with a capacity of 257 ml. Under the promotion of SDS CH 4 hydrate can be formed within 24 h with the hydration number of about 6. 5. Based on the analysis of phase graphs the reasonable scopes of hydration pressure and temperature were determined. It was shown by experiments that at 281. 2 0. 2 K and 5 MPa, CH 4 were replaced from its hydrate with the above emulsion and the replacement ratio was about 1. 5 times of that replaced with pure liquid CO 2, which indicated that the result was more excellent to replace with CO 2 emulsion than with liquid CO 2. At the same time, it was investigated that to replace CH 4 in its hydrate with CO 2 at other pressure and temperature and with liquid and gaseous CO 2. It was reasonable to replace CH 4 from its hydrate with high-internal CO 2 emulsion under some condition, in which CO 2 hydrate can but CH 4 hydrate can not exist stably. 天然气水合物是一种储量巨大的清洁能源，而二氧化碳（CO 2 ）是需要限制排放的温室气体。利用CO 2 置换开采天然气水合物是一种集能源产出与温室气体处置于一体的新型开采方案。将CO 2 制备成乳状液的目的在于利用二氧化碳乳状液的某些特性达到强化置换反应、以推动置换开采走向商业化。 研究了乳化剂用量、CO 2 与水的质量比、乳化压力、乳化器搅拌速度等对乳化过程和结果的影响。实验中所使用的乳化器容积为 350 ml；乳化剂为一种非离子表面活性剂-TMN- 6 。研究表明，在 25 ℃以下、 30 MPa左右，经过快速剪切可以制备出稳定的水包CO 2 型乳状液。 研究了一系列水包CO 2 乳状液对石英砂中CH 4 水合物的置换动力学，测定了用这些乳状液置换天然气水合物中CH 4 的置换率随置换时间的变化。在容积 257 ml的模拟反应器中，被置换的天然气水合物是用甲烷于润湿的石英砂中经制冷形成的，在SDS作用下， 24 h内可以完成甲烷水合物的形成，水合常数约为 6. 5 。根据水合物相图分析了置换反应的温度压力范围。研究发现，在 281. 2 0. 2 K、 5 MPa下，以CO 2 乳状液注入含CH 4 水合物的石英砂中，CH 4 的置换率为使用纯液态CO 2 时置换率的 1. 5 倍左右。同时还研究了CO 2 乳状液在其他温度压力范围的置换、以及液态和气态CO 2 在相关条件下的置换效果，发现合理的置换应该是：以高浓度CO 2 乳状液，在CO 2 水合物能稳定、而CH 4 水合物不能稳定存在的温度压力范围内置换...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} work, three studies about non-aqueous dispersions of {{particles}} {{were carried out}} by using an amphiphilic block copolymer poly(isoprene) -block-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PI-b-PMMA) as stabilizer:rn 1. 	Dispersions of polyurethane and polyurea porous particles for polymer compositesrn 2. 	Dispersions of PMMA and PU particles with PDI dye for study of Single Molecule Spectroscopy Detectionrn 3. 	Dispersions of graphene nanosheets for polymer compositesrnrnIn the first study, highly porous polyurethane and polyurea particles were prepared in a non-aqueous emulsion. The preparation of porous particles consisted of two parts: At first, a system was developed where the emulsion had high stability for the polymerization among diisocyanate, diol and water. In the second part, porous particles were prepared by using two methods fission/fusion and combination by which highly porous particles were obtained. In this study, the applications of porous particles were also investigated where polyurethane particles were tested as filling material for polymer composites and as catalyst carrier for polyethylene polymerization. rnrnIn the second study, PMMA and PU particles from one non-aqueous emulsion were investigated via single molecule fluorescence detection. At first the particles were loaded with PDI dye, which were detected by fluorescence microscopy. The distribution and orientation of the PDI molecules in the particles were successfully observed by Single Molecule Fluorescence Detection. The molecules were homogenously distributed inside of the particles. In addition they had random orientation, meaning that no aggregations of dye molecules were formed. With the results, it could be supposed that the polymer chains were also homogenously distributed in the particles, and that the conformation was relatively flexible. rnrnIn the third part of the study, graphene nanosheets with high surface area were dispersed in an organic solvent with low boiling point and low toxicity, THF, stabilized with a block copolymer PI-b-PMMA. The dispersion was used to prepare polymer composites. It was shown that the modified graphene nanosheets had good compatibility with the PS and PMMA matrices. rnDas amphiphile Blockcopolymer Polyisopren-b-PMMA (PI-b-PMMA) ist ein <b>Emulgator</b> für nicht-wässrige Emulsionen.

Herstellung von porösen Polyurethan-Partikelnrn 2. Untersuchung der PDI- Farbstoffmoleküle in Polymer-Partikelnrn 3. Nicht-wässrige Dispersion von Graphen-NanoschichtenrnrnIm ersten Projekt wurden hochgradig poröse Polyurethan-Partikel aus einer nicht-wässrigen Emulsion, stabilisiert mit PI-b-PMMA, hergestellt. Die poröse Struktur wurde gebildet durch das aus der Reaktion von Wasser mit Diisocyanat entstandene CO 2. Über die Wassermenge und die verwendeten Katalysatoren konnten die Eigenschaften der porösen Struktur kontrolliert werden. Zwei Anwendungen der porösen Partikel wurden untersucht: als Füllmaterial für Polymerkomposite und als Katalysatorträger für Polyethylen-Polymerisation. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass die poröse Struktur die Kontaktfläche vergrößert und damit die Wechselwirkung verstärkt. rnrnIm zweiten Projekt wurden PMMA- und PU-Partikel mit Farbstoff in einer nicht-wässrigen Emulsion hergestellt, die mit PI-b-PMMA stabilisiert wurde. Die Farbstoff-Moleküle wurden mit Einzelmolekül-Spektroskopie untersucht. Die Ergebnisse zeigten, dass die Farbstoffmoleküle relativ homogen in den Partikeln verteilt sind. Dies bedeutet, dass auch die Polymerketten relativ homogen in den Partikeln verteilt sind. Die Ergebnisse haben auch gezeigt, dass die Farbstoffmoleküle in den PU-Partikeln einen größeren Abstand zueinander haben als in den PMMA-Partikeln. rn rnIm dritten Projekt wurden Graphen-Nanoschichten in THF dispergiert und mit PI-b-PMMA stabilisiert. Diese Dispersion hatte eine Konzentration von 0, 1 mg/ml nach einer Zentrifugierung mit 1000 rmp. Das Blockcopolymer hat somit eine starke Wechselwirkung mit den Graphen-Nanoschichten. Die dispergierten Graphen-Nanoschichten wurden im Hinblick auf ihre Verwendbarkeit als Polymer-Nanokomposite untersucht. Diese zeigten eine gute Kompatibilität mit Polystyrol und PMMA.

İnsanoğlunun çeşitli etkenlerden dolayı gün içerisinde kendine yeterli zamanı ayıramamaya başlamış, bu durum üreticilerin pazar paylarını artırabilmeleri için yeni ürünler ortaya çıkarmalarına zemin hazırlamıştır. Üreticiler, piyasaya sundukları ürünlerde, günlük hayatta karşılaşılabilecek zorluklara pratik çözümler üretmeye başlamışlardır. Buzdolabı, günümüzde sadece yiyecekleri taze tutma fonksiyonunu yerine getiren bir ürün olmaktan çıkmıştır. Buz kırma, su sebili, şoklama v. b. fonksiyonlar tüm buzdolaplarda bulunabilen özelliklerdir. Günümüzde kullanıcılar, buzdolaplarından farklı fonksiyonları yerine getiren donanımlar beklemeye başlamışlardır. Dondurma yapan bir cihazın buzdolabına entegrasyonu projesi bu amaçla ortaya çıkmıştır. Dondurma, özellikle yaz aylarında serinlemek amacıyla tüketilen bir yiyecektir. Bu yiyeceğin hazırlanması için eskiden kol gücüne ihtiyaç duyulurken, günümüzde bir motor tarafından tahrik edilen sistemler kullanılmaktadır. Dondurma hazırlama işleminde karıştırma yapılırken, miksin soğutulması gerektiği aşikardır. Bundan yola çıkılarak, dondurmanın buzdolabı içerisinde yapılabileceği düşünülmüştür. Buzdolabı içerisinde dondurma yapma fonksiyonu, buzdolabının freezer kısmında bulunan soğuk havadan yararlanarak, dondurma yapımına imkan tanıyan bir uygulamadır. Dondurma pazarının dünyada ve ülkemizde giderek büyüdüğünü düşünürsek, ortaya çıkacak ürünlerin büyük ilgi uyandıracağı öngörülmektedir. Piyasada; büyük hacimlerde dondurma yapımını mümkün kılan endüstriyel dondurma yapma makineleri olduğu gibi, ev ortamında herkesin dondurma yapmasına olanak sağlayan dondurma yapma makineleri de bulunmaktadır.

Development of the {{technological}} issues, modernization, {{changing of the}} mankind’s demands induced arising of new products. In addition to this, it affects {{the challenge of the}} household market. Because of the fast improving technology, humans couldn’t spent enough time to their personel requirements. This situation arises new products and apparatus for ordinary devices for people demands made by many companies. This companies produces many practical solutions for tough conditions which makes peoples lives harder. At present, the refregirator device not only store food and drinks fresh, but also it has ice maker for makes small ice cubes from bulk ice, water found for supplying water which is desirable temparature and freezing function for food products spoiled quickly. After, demandings are getting bigger time to time, the users require new products or qualifications to accept new functions in household devices. The combination of the ice cream maker and refregirator avokes due tothe impact of this conditions. Ice cream, mainly contains milk, cream, water, low fat dry milk powder, oil for regulating the mix, materials for colouring the mix. Blending and adding different ratio and types of the contents, using physical and chemical solutions form ice cream products. Also, this products include protein, carbonhydrate, calcium, phosphor, magnesium, ferrous and zinc and they have called a nutritive value product. For some references, ice cream forms the ice cream mix pasteurized and cooled by cold fresh air and solidfied in long hours. In this part, said ice cream mix; the combination of milk proteins, sugar, corn sorbet, water, egg and egg products, stabilizator which ise useful for humans health and <b>emulgator.</b> When we look up the consumption of the ice cream, the demanding products depend on the change of the local settlements and the products of this local areas. In this meaning, there are vary of ice cream product for different kinds of taste. The most known, pure ice cream, has low fat and milk with vanilla which is absolutely necesary for the mix. Outline of these contents, the mix doesn’t content any additive or aroma. In chocolate ice cream includes, except for ingredients of pure ice cream, % 3 ratio of cacao and % 1 more sugar. According to local demands, fruit ice cream includes milk which has between % 15 and % 18 ratio of fat, between % 10 and % 15 ratio of fruit particles, fruit sorbet or aroma. With the combination of the ice cream maker and refregirator study aims to make ice cream products for benefit freezer compartment in refregirator device. In household market, the challenge is getting more strict and the companies produces new products, so they upgrade their product variety. In this fact, the food which desires and consumes in every states, like ice cream, prepared in house for users, is the key target for the household companies. Said companies invest a small part of fortune to research and development projects and making these devices which is located household products. In addition to investment, they barely endeavor to pass the projects into real life. The another aim of the investment; increasing the apparatus of the devices and making variety of functional systems in there. When we have looked last 5 years, both the world and Turkiye, the ice cream has fast growing sales values, the market rivalry has gotten strict and the more manufacturing companies are avoked in these time. Eventually, a device which is making this successful product in refregirator compartment, not only improve the functionality of the refregirator, but also it brings this products to foreground in household sector. The other objective of the project is to contribute to producing healthy ice cream products; to prove the capability of making ice cream products liked by people all around the world at their homes. In the market; most of fast consuming ice cream products includes many artificial materials which is called consistency accelerator or regulator. These materials affect human’s health and they accumulate the body and cause cancer. The combination of the ice cream maker and refregirator project is maintained by Arcelik Structural Design Management Department. In this project, product benchmark studies, the detection of reference ice cream products, the design of the alternative concepts, evaluation of the concepts and selection of the best, the study of prototyping, tructural analysis, structural reconstraints according to the analysis, testing of ice cream recipes, sensorial tests are sustained by the same department. The selection of the refregirator which contains ice cream maker devices and the critical terms of cooling, thermodynamic and physical parameters of the refregirator is completed by the assistance of the Arcelik Eskisehir Refregirator Plant. After the prototype was occured, the ice cream samples were tested in Arcelik Nourishment Laboratories. In addition, thanks to Arcelik Research and Development Thermodynamic Department, helps us to understanding refregirator cooling system and characteristic of working style. In the market, {{there are two types of}} devices used to making ice cream products. They are; • Industrial ice cream makers and coolers • Home made ice cream makers Industrial ice cream makers used in demanding high production of the ice cream, also it produces a great deal of products. Moreover, their cooling systems are more complicated than home made devices. Home made ice cream makers are smaller than industrial devices. It makes about one liter ice cream at one time. These devices are seperated two groups. The home made ice cream makers in first group, has only a motor and receptacle which has to took in refregirator freezer compartment about 13 hours before making ice cream. The devices in second group has own cooling systems. It also has compressor, condenser, evaparator and the pipes carried cooling liquid. In these devices, you could make ice cream in 90 minutes. In spite of the fact that it is very quick, the ice cream product made by the device has many ice particles and the mixture gets softer at the center. Consequently, it is not homogeneous and this is the main problem which has to solve in new products. Eventually, In this study, we researched the probability of the making ice cream in the refregirator freezing compartment and we tried to find new solutions about cooling the system, rotating the mixer etc. Then we designed different, alternative concepts. In benchmark stage, we investigated the most popular and successful home made ice cream devices in the market and optimized the system, determined the correct power system and transmission group. We are choosing the correct design showed up by evaluation of different criterias. After this, we design the correct alternative system with every components and we made a prototype accomplished the main function of the ice cream maker system. Finally, we tested the protype and advised the qualifications which makes the device the most useful. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
