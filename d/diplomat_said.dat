500|$|Bill Law of the BBC News {{said the}} [...] "recommendations if {{implemented}} in full would effectively return {{the country to}} a state of martial law". An unnamed western <b>diplomat</b> <b>said</b> the recommendations timing was likely due to 14 August protest plans and the increasing violence. Marc Jones said that many of the recommendations were already in place.

At least two European embassies in Norway were sent letters by their Chinese counterparts, denouncing the prize for being an interference in China's internal affairs and reaffirming their stance that Liu had committed crimes in China. One <b>diplomat</b> <b>said</b> his embassy's letter from the Chinese embassy requested obliquely that they [...] "refrain from attending any activity directed against China." [...] The Norwegian Nobel Committee said its invitation to the Chinese ambassador to attend the prize-giving was returned unanswered. The Chinese Vice Foreign Minister also warned countries supporting Liu's award that they would have to [...] "take responsibility for the consequences".|$|E
2500|$|The Economist called Xu Lin's {{statement}} [...] "a boastful challenge" [...] {{and said}} opponents of Confucius Institutes will claim {{this as a}} victory for academic freedom. The <b>Diplomat</b> <b>said</b> that the current CI program of 465 institutes is heavily weighted toward the West, with 97 located in the U.S. but only 95 institutes in all of Asia. However, if backlash in the West continues to grow, the number of CIs [...] "may plateau in the West while there remains immense potential for growth in other regions", including Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.|$|E

Regarding the recent international closures of Confucius Institutes, a July 2015 article in The <b>Diplomat</b> <b>said</b> that although nations like Japan use soft power to promote positive images of themselves {{for the sake of}} political profit, China uses soft power for lies and censorship, but the world [...] "sees through its con".|$|E
2500|$|Russia has {{in early}} 2011 blocked a first US/European draft {{resolution}} in the UN Security Council attempting to condemn Syrian use of force, and has on 12 May 2011 blocked a report on Iranian arm sales to Assad. A council <b>diplomat</b> <b>said,</b> that Russia objected to [...] "the publication of the report as an official Security Council document", but another council diplomat stated, [...] "It's obviously an attempt to protect (Syrian President) Bashar al-Assad". The vetoed report had apparently contained material incriminating both the leadership of Iran and Syria in the transmission of arms to militant groups. Russia vetoed {{the first draft of}} the US/European resolution fearing it could lead to interference in Syrian affairs.|$|E
2500|$|An UNGA vote on {{recognition}} {{for the state}} of Palestine is expected at the end of September. Expectations for an approval by a large majority are high. The wording of the resolution by the Fatah movement was crafted {{in such a way as}} to bring states doubtful of a vote to either support it or at least abstain. The draft does not state a recognition of Palestine under the 1967 borders, but instead asks for permanent borders to be negotiated based on the principle of the 4 June 1967; a move that even elicited the support of some members of the rival Palestinian movement Hamas, who has previously said that recognition of the 1967 borders before a final-status deal would mean waiving the claim for the right of return of refugees. On 15 September, a senior Palestinian <b>diplomat</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "we will make the final decision soon" [...] when disputed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas [...] "announce the final decision." [...] At the same time Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian permanent observer to the United Nations, reiterated the same statement in saying how the Palestinian would go forward with the move. [...] "We have the right to join the international community as a full member...This campaign has this symbolic gesture of a chair, a set of Palestine to become a full members of the United Nations. This campaign went into different parts of the globe and they ended in New York." [...] Basem Elmary, a coordinator for Palestine at the UN, said that U.S. opposition to the issue needing the involvement of direct negotiations with Israel was [...] "the blackmail to us." [...] An U.S. State Department spokesperson said that a veto against the vote should not be surprising.|$|E

2500|$|The Algerian police used {{night vision}} devices to {{identify}} the lead hijacker, Abdul Abdullah Yahia. The government sent his mother to plead for her son to release the passengers, hoping that her pleas would cause Yahia to give in. The tactic backfired. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, said that Yahia became enraged by the attempt. The hijackers began to target the French passengers; two staff members of the Embassy of France in Algeria, a secretary and a chef, were on board. The hijackers used the chef, Yannick Beugnet, by having him plead in the microphone. The hijackers demanded that if the Algerian government did not let the A300 take off before 9:30pm, the hijackers would kill one passenger every 30 minutes, starting with Beugnet. They threatened to shoot him and throw {{him out of the}} door. The French <b>diplomat</b> <b>said</b> that the Algerians assured them that the hijackers were bluffing while the French demanded that the aircraft be allowed to take off. When the deadline passed, the hijackers fatally shot the chef. The door open warning light in the cockpit indicated to the pilots that another passenger had been murdered. Enraged, Captain Delhemme yelled at the Algerian authorities, saying [...] "see what you get when you play tough?!". The airline knew that the chef was murdered since it listened to the conversations between the aircraft and the control tower. Philippe Legorjus, a former Air France security adviser, {{said in an interview that}} the airline employees [...] "lived through" [...] the event [...] "with great emotion." [...] Passenger Zahida Kakachi recalls Lotfi calmly converting two stewardesses to Islam, herself and another woman, though Kakachi was only pretending so that she would not enrage or upset Lotfi.|$|E
