Along with Horotiu (on the NIMT between Te Rapa and Ngaruawahia) Masterton still has Woods Points Keys. The Horotiu ones are not in regular use.|$|E
25|$|Trains {{arriving}} at Kew {{were required to}} pull up to end of the platform verandah. The crossover from 1 to 2 road was usually not in use by the 1950s, and a sleeve was placed across it to prevent its operation. The down <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> at Kew was usually set at proceed, unless required to be placed at stop to operate the interlocking frame.|$|E
25|$|The {{conductor}} {{driver was}} {{not qualified to}} drive diesel locomotives, but he had done so occasionally before. It was {{thought that he was}} used to driving without a speedometer and so had misjudged his speed on the approach to Lincoln, entering a 15 mph curve at around 55 mph. The driver had also evidently been inattentive because the <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> near the curve was not cleared until the train was almost at it, yet it passed the signal at around 60 mph.|$|E
50|$|Exceptionally in New South Wales <b>home</b> {{and distant}} <b>signals</b> {{controlled}} {{from the same}} signal box would be installed, especially on outer <b>home</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{distinguish}} clearly between the two, distant signals use square plates while <b>home</b> <b>signals</b> use circular plates.|$|R
25|$|Line 1 uses two-aspect red/green <b>home</b> <b>signals,</b> yellow/green distant {{signals and}} a {{passenger}} information system (PIS). The current system replaced 1950s-era semaphore signals.|$|R
25|$|Interlockings {{are places}} where tracks are {{connected}} by switches and where routes may conflict. They are arranged in a specific way, with switches and signals that prevent conflicting movements once one route is set up. Interlocking signals are fixed signals within an interlocking, containing two separate red-yellow-green signal heads and often other indications. A <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> is defined as an interlocking signal {{at the entrance to}} a route or block to control trains entering that route or block. These terms are used interchangeably, as most interlockings only have one controlled signal on each track.|$|E
2500|$|The {{warning signal}} {{is the most}} unusual of {{the three types of}} British {{permissive}} signal. It is, like the shunt-ahead, placed under the signal governing entry to the section ahead, but its function is very different. For a signalman to accept a train, both his block section and the line for a quarter mile inside his outer <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> must usually be clear; the quarter mile is a precaution in case the driver fails to stop in time for the outer <b>home</b> <b>signal.</b> However, it is possible to accept a train under the [...] "Warning Arrangement" [...] if the block section, but not the quarter-mile overlap, is clear. As its name implies, the signalman must stop and caution the driver of the train concerned, and the warning signal simply replaces the signalman's caution where this operation is frequent. Because there is no margin for braking error, the warning arrangement cannot usually be applied to passenger trains: its commonest use is to allow a goods train to run into a section to shunt a siding {{in the middle of that}} section, while a train is still occupying the station ahead.|$|E
2500|$|He {{stopped at}} a marker [...] {{to the rear of}} Bromsgrove Station up <b>home</b> <b>signal,</b> or further up if {{necessary}} to clear the crossover by which the bankers moved on {{to the back of his}} train. They were not coupled to his train or to each other. When he was in position each banker gave two crow whistles, and the train driver gave two crows in reply. Then he gave one long whistle and all of them opened their regulators.|$|E

On 28 September 1991, the Lincolnshire Wolds Railway obtained a Light Railway Order authorising the reinstatement of the East Lincolnshire Railway between [...] and the former Keddington Road level crossing near Louth, which would include the line up to Holton-le-Clay.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{suburban}} passenger trains, {{the first}} travelling to East Hills the following train travelling to Bankstown, collided at about 12:30pm. The Bankstown train was travelling at [...] {{a few seconds}} before the crash. Both trains were crowded, each with around 1200 passengers, many travelling home after work (it being a Saturday), and Christmas shoppers. The East Hills train was being held at a <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> just on the Sydney side of Sydenham Junction station. The two leading cars of the Bankstown train telescoped into the two trailing cars of the East Hills train.|$|E
2500|$|During violent {{thunderstorms}} on {{the evening}} of 19 June 2007 the railway suffered major damage, much more extensive than any in its history.

5000|$|There {{are also}} types of dwarf signals, called [...] "Main Dwarf signals" [...] (Huvuddvärgsignal) used as stand-ins for <b>home</b> <b>signals</b> in {{stations}} with lot of shunting or {{where there are}} a lot of switches that needs a signal.|$|R
2500|$|In Germany the {{standard}} distance {{from a distant}} signal to its <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> is [...] On a train with strong brakes, this is the braking distance from 160km/h. In the 1960s Germany evaluated various options to increase speeds, including increasing the distance between distant and home signals, and cab signalling. Increasing {{the distance between the}} home and distant signals would decrease capacity. Adding another aspect would make the signals harder to recognize. In either case, changes to the conventional signals wouldn't solve the problem of the difficulty of seeing and reacting to the signals at higher speeds. To overcome these problems, Germany chose to develop continuous cab signalling.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 January 1948, a train formed of a 6PAN and a 6PUL unit, which formed that day's 7:30am {{service from}} [...] {{coupled with the}} 8:50am from Seaford, was allowed to draw up to the inner <b>home</b> <b>signal,</b> where it should have stopped. Instead, it overran the signal and {{collided}} at a speed of between [...] with an empty stock which had formed the 8:20am from [...] and was waiting to depart London Bridge's platform 14 for [...] This train was formed of two 6PAN units. The train that was struck was forced through the buffers and demolished a bookstall. Two train crew and one passenger were killed and 34 people were injured.|$|E
2500|$|At 6.38 am {{the first}} of the {{northbound}} expresses from Carlisle passed Quintinshill safely. At 6.42 am Kirkpatrick [...] "offered" [...] the southbound troop train to Quintinshill. Signalman Tinsley immediately accepted the troop train, and four minutes later he was offered and accepted the second northbound express from Gretna Junction. At 6.47 am Tinsley received the [...] "train entering section" [...] signal from Kirkpatrick for the troop train and offered it forward to Gretna Junction, having forgotten all about the local passenger train (aboard which he had himself arrived that morning), which was occupying the Up line. The troop special was immediately accepted by Gretna Junction, so Tinsley pulled [...] "off" [...] his Up <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> to allow the troop train to run forward.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} between Bavarian <b>home</b> <b>signals</b> {{and those of}} the Reichsbahn was the shape of the semaphore arm. On Reichsbahn signals the tip of the semaphore is circular in shape; on Bavarian signals it is diamond-shaped (see illustration).|$|R
50|$|Coupled distant <b>signals</b> combine <b>home</b> aspects {{controlling}} drivers actions at {{the signal}} and distant aspects {{warning of the}} aspects of the following <b>home</b> <b>signals.</b> There are no separate ‘home’ and ‘distant’ lights, the various aspects indicate both home and distant instructions together.|$|R
50|$|Strathmerton has a disused and rundown platform, and two disused <b>home</b> <b>signals</b> for up trains at {{the down}} {{end of the}} station. The points for the Cobram line have been lifted, with freight trains {{continuing}} to use the line north to Tocumwal.|$|R
2500|$|At 8:29am, the {{dispatcher}} lined the DCS at Dalehurst, where {{the section of}} double track ended, to allow the Super Continental to take the south track. [...] This turnout configuration at Dalehurst would have caused the absolute (<b>home)</b> <b>signal</b> at the control point to display a stop indication. [...] The double-aspect approach signal [...] east of Dalehurst showed an approach indication, yellow over red (meaning prepare {{to stop at the}} next signal while reducing speed to [...] ). [...] As the train approached this signal, the throttle was in the 8th notch with the train speed at , [...] faster than the [...] limit on this stretch of track. [...] The engineer made no attempt to slow down after passing the approach signal.|$|E
2500|$|A single-stall {{engine shed}} {{was the home}} for the {{locomotive}} that worked the branch, {{with a variety of}} locomotives serving in this capacity. [...] In the early years, the job was handled by an L or NZR D class (1874)class (2-4-0T), and occasionally by a [...] locomotives were allocated to the branch, alternately based at Greytown and Cross Creek, being swapped as required. [...] In the late 1930s they were replaced by WF class 2-6-4T locomotives, both of which were converted for one-man operation. In its heyday the branch had six staff, but [...] reductions in 1931 pared this back to one, who was stationmaster, porter, shunter, guard, and general factotum. [...] As the branch had only one locomotive in steam at any time, the only signal was a <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> protecting Woodside.|$|E
2500|$|Cross Creek {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{stations}} on the Wairarapa Line to receive signals, with the Working Timetable of 1887 being the first to list them. [...] Instructions for the crossing of trains laid down that southbound trains were to take the siding or loop, and northbound trains were to take the main line. [...] There were two safety sidings, each of which had a ground disc to indicate its position. [...] A <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> was also installed at the foot of the incline, and a starting signal controlled trains leaving for Featherston at the other end of the yard. [...] Though there was a building next to the station in which a lever frame was used to set some points using mechanical interlocking, this was never as extensive as at other stations.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Proceed slowly onto a {{branching}} track' (Fahrt frei in ein abzweigendes Gleis) {{was indicated}} on two-armed <b>home</b> <b>signals</b> from 1893 to 1922 {{by a white}} light with a green light vertically below it. From 1948 the lower, green, light was exchanged for a yellow one.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} also an {{important}} crossing point for trains to and from Melbourne and Warrnambool with a long crossing loop located adjacent the station building. The precinct was protected by two semaphore <b>home</b> <b>signals,</b> one on the up side {{and one on the}} down side.|$|R
50|$|An outer home protects {{a neutral}} long {{of a quarter}} of a mile (440yards/400m) clear of any points or sidings. This allows trains to {{approach}} when the station or junction is obstructed. It is noted that the junction in the Sunshine rail accident did not have outer <b>home</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
2500|$|With the Down loop occupied, {{night shift}} {{signalman}} Meakin decided to shunt the local passenger train onto the Up main line. At {{this point the}} southbound empty coal train {{was standing at the}} Up <b>Home</b> <b>signal</b> to the north of Quintinshill, and accordingly it was still occupying the section from Kirkpatrick (the next signalbox to the north). [...] This meant that signalman Meakin had not yet telegraphed Kirkpatrick the [...] "train out of section" [...] signal for the empty coal train, and he could not send the [...] "blocking back" [...] signal to advise the Kirkpatrick signalman that the local train was standing on the Up main line. [...] Once the local train had crossed onto the Up main line, Meakin allowed the empty coal wagon train to proceed into the Up loop. [...] Arriving late aboard the local train, the early day shift signalman Tinsley reached Quintinshill signalbox shortly after 6.30 am. At 6.34 am one of the signalmen (it was never established which) gave the [...] "train out of section" [...] bell to Kirkpatrick for the coal train. At this point, two crucial failures in signalling procedure occurred (see Rules breaches).|$|E
6000|$|He {{had already}} pulled the lever of the <b>home</b> <b>signal,</b> and now, with two mighty pulls, blocked both {{up and down}} lines with the distant signals. At {{the same time he}} pulled other levers, and shifted the [...] "points," [...] so as to let the plethoric goods train just arrived, and the goods train in waiting, perform their {{respective}} evolutions. It required nearly all Sam's strength to [...] "pull over" [...] several of those levers, because, besides being somewhat heavy to work, even at their best, several of them had got slightly out of order--wanted oiling, perhaps. It was quite evident to the meanest capacity that there was room for improvement in this department of the Grand National Trunk Railway. In performing this last operation Sam locked all the semaphores, and so rendered his part of the line absolutely impregnable. There was so much vigorous action and whistling here, and such puffing and backing and pushing {{on the part of the}} engines, that a superficial observer might have supposed there was a great deal of movement and confusion to no purpose, but we need scarcely say that such was not the case. Several trucks of goods were dropped by both trains, to be carried on by other trains, and several trucks that had been left by other trains, were taken up, and thus in a few minutes a part of the enormous traffic of the line was assorted.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, {{a signal}} box with an {{intermediate}} block section {{will have a}} <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> (and associated distant signal), starting signal and an intermediate block <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> {{which has its own}} distant signal. The line from the starting signal to the intermediate block <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> is called the intermediate block home section. The line from the intermediate block <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> to the <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> of the next signal box on the same line in the same direction of travel is the absolute block section. To clear the intermediate block <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> a [...] "line clear" [...] is required from the signal box in advance.|$|E
50|$|If {{there are}} {{multiple}} routes ahead and corresponding <b>home</b> (or starting) <b>signals</b> have poor visibility, a preliminary route indicator (進路予告機, shinro yokokuki) is installed below the signal one block before the <b>home</b> (or starting) <b>signals.</b> A preliminary route indicator advises the route displayed by the relevant <b>home</b> (or starting) <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|The station {{opened with}} a {{crossing}} loop of about 400m length. In 2010, the crossing loop was extended into a 7km passing lane. Exceptionally this passing lane has intermediate <b>home</b> <b>signals</b> protecting a level crossing and some wheat sidings which {{have the effect of}} allowing the passing lane to hold two trains in one direction.|$|R
2500|$|In later years, {{interlocking}} <b>home</b> <b>signals</b> {{north and}} west of Rockville (near Harrisburg) were modified so that the two outside lights in the horizontal [...] "stop" [...] row had red lenses; the center lamp would be extinguished when the signal displayed [...] "stop". Such [...] "red-eye" [...] lenses were also temporarily installed at Overbrook Interlocking near Philadelphia.|$|R
