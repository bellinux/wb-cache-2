Some experts say that Canada has just narrowly dodged a recession, although the economy is in its worst shape since 1991.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the most}} {{difficult}} opponent in 2006 for the Buffaloes, since Oklahoma had been selected No. 1 in 4 preseason polls. The main threat, Adrian Peterson on his run for the Heisman Trophy, was injured the previous week. Oklahoma had a disappointing 2005 going 8–4. This was the 57th meeting with Oklahoma dominating the series 38–16–2, but Colorado has taken 5 of the last 10 (5–4–1). They last played each other in 2004.

25|$|D.C. United's sudden turn in {{fortunes}} {{continued in}} the team's final home regular-season match, against cellar-dwelling Chicago Fire. United broke through {{late in the first}} half, when Pontius won a race, beating two defenders and the Fire's goalie, Jon Busch to the ball and then rounding the goalie and slotting home the first goal. Midway through the second half, Boswell scored with a header on a corner kick taken by Espindola. A few minutes later, Espindola got his own goal, with an assist to DeLeon, when a sharply taken shot was deflected just inside the near post. A 4-0 scoreline was completed when a deflected shot came to Saborio in the 6-yard box, and the Costa Rican striker's shot beat the Fire 'keeper. The four-goal margin was the team's largest margin of victory since August 2011. The team would close out the regular season in Columbus, part of MLS' first Decision Day. <b>Going</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> final day, United held a one-point lead over Columbus for second place in the Eastern Conference, but four teams would be playing with a chance at claiming second place and a bye through the first round of MLS playoffs. That prize would depend on the results in Columbus and in a match being played at the same time between visiting Montreal and host Toronto. As United geared to play the MLS regular season finale, CONCACAF group play concluded. Thanks to a goal surrendered by the Los Angeles Galaxy on the last kick of their game in Guatemala, D.C. United would carry the #2 seed into the CONCACAF quarterfinals, matching them against the #7 seed, Queretaro F.C. in early 2016.|$|E
500|$|At the time, the National Hockey League was {{considered}} to be where the best hockey players played, and its best players consisted largely of Canadians. The public consensus of hockey pundits and fans in North America was that other countries, the Soviets in this case, were simply no match for Canada's best. The Soviets were not expected to even give the Canadians a challenge, and Canada was <b>going</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> series expected to win handily. According to Team Canada Coach Harry Sinden: [...] "Canada is first in the world in two things: hockey and wheat." [...] Alan Eagleson said [...] "We gotta win in eight games. Anything less than an unblemished sweep of the Russians would bring shame down on the heads of the players and the national pride." [...] The Soviets downplayed themselves, stating that they were in the series to learn.|$|E

50|$|New rules <b>going</b> <b>into</b> effect <b>this</b> year {{significantly}} {{changed the}} way the game was played, including {{an increase in the}} distance required to get a first down to ten yards, and also that an incomplete pass would be considered a turnover.

500|$|After {{losing the}} World Series {{in six games}} to the Boston Red Sox, Matheny and general manager John Mozeliak {{explained}} that Miller's role was as [...] "insurance." [...] In just one game until Michael Wacha's final start– which was {{the final game of}} the year– did a starter go less than five innings. [...] Miller also became less effective as the season progressed late, with his strikeout rate decreasing and walk rate increasing. [...] Said Matheny, [...] "It {{would have to be a}} situation where we were pushing into a tight spot, and that's just not fair to him without having much action to this point. [...] He's been exactly what we’ve needed up to this point. [...] Fortunately we haven’t needed that long outing." [...] Mozeliak added that [...] "second-guessing the roster doesn’t have traction. [...] His role was always that insurance. [...] There were a lot of question marks as we were <b>going</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> on exactly how our rotation was going to unfold. [...] The fact that everybody has stepped up changed the dynamic." ...|$|E

500|$|Discussing {{the season}} finale, Tancharoen stated, [...] "This season, we've {{explored}} {{a lot of}} different themes: There's the notion of purpose. We also introduced an Inhuman who has a strong sense of faith. We talk a lot about destiny and all these things intertwine." [...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D.

We knew <b>going</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new."

2500|$|In September, Opposition and Commonwealth Liberal Party leader Joseph Cook {{addressed}} {{parliament in}} support of conscription: [...] "There are some that {{do not believe in}} the compulsion of men, who say that Australia has done enough ...

In neither house did any member of the opposition vote against the bill [...] the against vote came entirely from Labor detractors. [...] Upon the second moving of the Referendum Bill, Frank Tudor resigned from Hughes' cabinet. A group of 15 representatives and 12 senators, led by Frank Brennan and Myles Ferricks, opposed the bill at every stage {{on the grounds that it}} was a question of conscience on which no majority, no matter how large, had a right to impose its will on the minority.

2500|$|Callas's {{voice was}} {{noted for its}} three {{distinct}} registers: Her low or chest register was extremely dark and almost baritonal in power, and she used this part of her voice for dramatic effect, often <b>going</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> register much higher on the scale than most sopranos. Her middle register had a peculiar and highly personal sound—"part oboe, part clarinet", as Claudia Cassidy described it—and was noted for its veiled or [...] "bottled" [...] sound, {{as if she were}} singing into a jug. Walter Legge attributed this sound to the [...] "extraordinary formation of her upper palate, shaped like a Gothic arch, not the Romanesque arch of the normal mouth". The upper register was ample and bright, with an impressive extension above high C, which—in contrast to the light flute-like sound of the typical coloratura, [...] "she would attack these notes with more vehemence and power—quite differently therefore, from the very delicate, cautious, 'white' approach of the light sopranos." [...] Legge adds, [...] "Even in the most difficult fioriture there were no musical or technical difficulties {{in this part of the}} voice which she could not execute with astonishing, unostentatious ease. Her chromatic runs, particularly downwards, were beautifully smooth and staccatos almost unfailingly accurate, even in the trickiest intervals. There is hardly a bar in the whole range of nineteenth-century music for high soprano that seriously tested her powers." [...] And as she demonstrated in the finale of La sonnambula on the commercial EMI set and the live recording from Cologne, she was able to execute a diminuendo on the stratospheric high E-flat, which Scott describes as [...] "a feat unrivaled in the history of the gramophone." ...|$|E
