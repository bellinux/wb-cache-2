500|$|In a 2009 interview, Sevigny {{reflected}} on her career, {{and said she}} was content with the level of stardom she had maintained: [...] "When I was in my early 20s, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a British pop star, Jarvis Cocker; of course, pop stars have much more celebrity, I think, than actors even. They're really hunted by their fans much more. I remember driving around these remote towns in Wales and kids running after us in the street. I was like, 'This is horrible!' And I saw the effect it had on him, and that's when I decided I never wanted to be a celebrity at that level, and I think that's why I've chosen to do the work that I do and just kind of work with directors that I love and try and do work that means something to me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] {{said the}} father; [...] "of course I couldn't {{go out with}} my own son; there's Theobald French; <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> his cousin just after Waterloo." ...|$|E
60|$|Nov. 3. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> my gun, {{and killed}} two fowls like ducks, which {{were very good}} food. In the {{afternoon}} went to work to make me a table.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a reg'lar swindle an' humbug; that's what it is. An' if all {{farmers are}} like that old feller <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>with,</b> I don't see how they keep anybody with 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They misled you, then, for I am but a poor sportsman, and by {{no means}} enthusiastic. Indeed, whether <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> rod or gun, I usually convert the {{expedition}} into a search for plants." ...|$|R
