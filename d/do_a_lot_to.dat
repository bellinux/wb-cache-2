Giving the episode a positive review, Currentfilm.com considered {{it to be}} [...] "one of the best Mr. Burns-centric episodes ever", {{and that it has}} [...] "some classic Burns moments, especially when Monty describes exactly what it took for him to capture the creature." [...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide stated that, while the episode [...] "doesn’t <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> expand the character", it [...] "manages a reasonable number of yuks". He added that [...] "A fun Howard Stern-esque character done by Michael McKean helps make this a nice show." [...] David Plath of DVD Town wrote that the episode has [...] "Some funny moments". Giving the episode a mixed review, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide said that the episode is [...] "Very funny when it's funny, very poor when it isn't." [...] They wrote that {{the best part of the}} episode is [...] "the Scottish stuff," [...] and [...] "the idea that, once again, Burns is actually worried about his public image, as he was in 'The Joy of Sect'."

500|$|In the State Senate, Solis {{authored}} 17bills {{to prevent}} {{domestic violence and}} championed labor, education, and health care issues. She described herself as [...] "a big believer that government, if done right, can <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> {{improve the quality of}} people's lives". In 1995 she sponsored a bill to raise the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.75; it was strongly opposed by business organizations and the restaurant industry. When Governor Pete Wilson vetoed it, she organized a successful drive to make the issue into a ballot initiative the next year, using $50,000 of her own campaign funds and rallying union support. The initiative's passing garnered her a statewide reputation and other states followed with similar initiatives. She chaired the labor committee and established herself as loyal to labor interests, but made a point of establishing relationships with Republicans on the committee. Solis held high-profile hearings on labor law enforcement following a summer 1995 sweatshop raid in El Monte that discovered more than 70 Thai workers existing in slave-like conditions. She called garment manufacturers to explain themselves and pushed for tougher enforcement of anti-sweatshop laws. Republican State Senator Ray Haynes later said that Solis was [...] "a committed liberal in the pockets of labor", but Republican State Senate Leader Rob Hurtt said of her, [...] "We obviously didn't see eye to eye. But she was respectful. I'll give her credit; she was a very hard worker and she knew her stuff." ...|$|E

[...] Speaking to Channel 5, Barber {{revealed}} Rhys would not <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> redeem himself in the new year, but viewers would get learn more about his back story, which could explain his dark side. During a 2012 interview with Kilkelly, Barber said his character is good at getting what he wants, saying [...] "I {{think at the end of}} the day, he just wants to win and he has this ability to justify why he does things, and if people are hurt in the process, it's their fault. His vision is the one that is most important." [...] Barber said that deep down, Rhys is sensitive and he means well. When asked about the reaction Rhys has received from viewers, Barber believed they liked the character as he is unpredictable and manipulative. He added that the viewers are interested in seeing what Rhys does next. When asked how he felt about playing a bad boy by DNA's Matthew Myers, Barber revealed that he loved it, saying [...] "It's always exciting getting the scripts because I never know which way they are going to turn or who I'm going to be turning on!" [...] The actor quipped that he is always wondering which character he is going to manipulate or [...] "screw over" [...] next and added [...] "But at the core of things Rhys has a heart of gold." ...|$|E

A common misconception about Bolles is that they recruit and their teams are composed of blue-chip college prospects.

Rogers stated, [...] "As coaches, we don't <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> make Division I football players; they pretty much make themselves.

He played them music inspired by such natural sounds, and showed them paintings of natural beauty.

50|$|Hedgehog {{domestication}} {{became popular}} in the early 1980s. They still have much of their wild behavior, including a fear of predators—especially humans—but buying from a responsible breeder and proper handling will <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> ensure a friendly relationship. Since domestication began, several new colours of hedgehogs have been created or become common, including albino and pinto hedgehogs. (Pinto is a color pattern, rather than a color: a total lack of color on the quills and skin beneath in distinct patches.)Domesticated species prefer a warm climate (above 22 °C, 72 °F) and do not naturally hibernate. Attempts to hibernate due to lowered body temperatures can be fatal, but are easily reversed if caught within a few days. In the wild they eat a diet of mainly insects, but pet owners generally prefer a diet composed primarily of high-protein, low-fat, high-quality cat food, with regular treats such as mealworms, fruits, vegetables, and cooked unseasoned meats.|$|E
