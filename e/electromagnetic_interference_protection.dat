40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} (MR) imaging has unparalleled soft-tissue imaging capabilities. The {{presence of}} {{devices such as}} pacemakers and implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (ICDs), however, is historically considered a contraindication to MR imaging. These devices are now smaller, with less magnetic material and improved <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> <b>protection.</b> This review summarizes the potential hazards of the device-MR environment interaction, and presents updated information regarding in-vivo and in-vitro experiments. Recent reports on patients with implantable pacemakers and ICDs who underwent MR scan shows that under certain conditions patients with these implanted systems may benefit from this imaging modality. The data presented suggests that certain modern pacemaker and ICD systems may indeed be MR safe. This may have major clinical implications on current imaging practice...|$|E

30|$|Recently, to {{meet the}} modern {{communication}} system demands of miniaturization and high frequency, high-density integrated capacitors have attracted increasing industry interest, which {{has been driven by}} thin-film integrated passive devices (IPDs) [1 – 3], <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> (EMI) <b>protection</b> [4], high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) input-/output-matching circuit blocks [5], and digital and mixed signal applications [6]. Several semiconductor technologies, such as low-temperature co-firing ceramics (LTCC) [7] and sputtering [8], can be used to fabricate materials with high relative permittivity. However, both LTCC and sputtering need sintering at approximately 850 °C to form the desired crystallite structure, which is a critical problem for embedding passive devices. Consequently, a new, green, and environmentally friendly approach called aerosol deposition (AD), which can deposit ceramic films at room temperature, has attracted great interest. The pioneering work was published in 2001 [9], and various ceramic films fabricated by AD have been studied quite intensively in recent years.|$|R

40|$|Mirotznik, Mark S. Electromagnetic {{multifunctional}} composites merge {{the excellent}} structural performance of structural composites with additional functionality such as sensing, communication, or <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>interference</b> <b>protection.</b> The multifunctionality aspect {{of these devices}} increases the functional capability of structures and can reduce weight, size, and cost. Often left addressed {{in the development of}} these structures, is the scalability and practicality of fabricating devices over large surface areas. In this dissertation, scalable methods of fabricating embedded electromagnetic devices are explored using highly scalable additive manufacturing techniques. Both screen printing and microdispensing of silver conductive inks are used to demonstrate common devices found in electromagnetic systems. Specifically, transmission line feeds, frequency selective surfaces, high impedance surfaces, and antennas are demonstrated and fabricated within woven fabric structural composites. Through these devices, the electromechanical tradeoffs of embedded printed conductors were explored. It was found that silver conductive inks that were screen printed onto glass woven fabrics experienced a reduction of conductivity and an increase in electrical path length. Additionally, the mechanical shear strength and delamination resistance of a composite decreased compared to a baseline when printed with a continuous plane of conductive ink. At higher frequencies, screen printed, embedded frequency selective surfaces compared well against devices fabricated with copper clad polyimide. The high scalability of screen printing pairs well with the patterning of frequency selective surfaces over large structures. Microdispensing of silver conductive inks was also explored as a higher quality method of depositing silver inks onto woven fabrics. The high turnover of additive manufacturing allowed for rapid processing of multiple antenna design iterations in a short time period. In addition, microdispensing allows for the deposition of higher conductivity, lower viscosity inks that were difficult to deposit onto woven fabrics via screen printing. The resulting antenna showed high conductivity, within an order of magnitude of copper, and excellent radiation performance. A final device was demonstrated using multimaterial additive manufacturing that combined an embedded antenna and high impedance surface fabricated within a single machine. A method for predicting the dielectric properties of geometrically controlled polycarbonate substrates was determined. This method was used to fabricate multiple substrates with varying dielectric properties using a single material. Additionally, the co-deposition of silver conductive ink and polycarbonate was used to additively manufacture both the embedded antenna and high impedance ground plane. The measured antenna showed improved performance when radiating above the high impedance surface relative to a continuous conducting surface at the same distance.
