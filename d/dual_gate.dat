The 4-4-2 package was moved to the Cutlass Calais, and while it lacked the <b>Dual</b> <b>Gate</b> shifter, it was essentially a carryover of the 1979 Hurst/Olds, even having the Oldsmobile 350 V8 886 80 442's were produced for 1980.

50|$|From the owner's manual:The {{adoption}} of a single-stage differential amplifier with low-noise dual transistors, a current mirror load and a 3-stage Darlington triple SEPP circuit provides a bumper power output of 270 watts + 270 watts (20 Hertz to 20,000 Hertz {{with no more than}} 0.03% THD) which is extremely stable. The power amplifier is configured as a DC power amplifier with the capacitors removed from the NFB circuit for a flat gain response. The large-sized toroidal transformers with their superb regulation employ 22,000 µF large-capacity electrolytic capacitors (two per each channel). There are independent dual power supply circuits with separate power transformer windings to provide power for the left and right channels. The FM front end incorporates a two-stage RF circuit that employs a 5-gang tuning capacitor and three <b>dual</b> <b>gate</b> MOS FETs for high gain and low noise. This configuration excels in ridding the sound of undesirable interference. The FM IF amplifier combines five dual-element ceramic filters…for high selectivity (80 dB) and low distortion… The local oscillator includes Pioneer’s very own quartz sampling locked APC (Automatic Phase Control). This output of this extremely precise quartz oscillator is divided into frequencies of 100 kHz and so reception frequencies which are a multiple of 100 kHz are locked at every 100 kHz.|$|E
5000|$|The first Hurst/Olds was the 1968 Hurst/Olds. It shared {{its body}} with the regular Oldsmobile Cutlass and 442, but had a unique Peruvian Silver and Black paint scheme. The Hurst/Olds was powered by a [...] 308° {{duration}} cam W-45 (without A/C) or 285/287° duration cam W-46 (with A/C) 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8. This engine {{was similar to the}} [...] W-34 455 engine offered in the Toronado and the [...] W-33 455 option available on the full-sized Delta 88. The W-45 and the milder W-46 engines differed in camshaft and cylinder head selection. The 455 was mated to a code OW three-speed Turbo Hydramatic 400 transmission with console-mounted Hurst Dual-Gate shifter that permitted automatic or manually ratched shifting. 515 production examples of the 1968 model were built in 2 body styles. There were 51 club coupes and 464 sport coupes manufactured. The Hurst/Olds was the only GM intermediate-sized car to offer an engine larger than 400 cubic inches thanks to a corporate policy at that time which prohibited the divisions from putting larger engines in cars smaller than full-sized models other than the Chevrolet Corvette. Oldsmobile got around the 400 cubic-inch limit by implying that the engines were installed by Hurst, not Olds. In fact, the special drive train and ram-air package (shared with the W-30 and W-31) was installed at the factory. The cars were then taken across town (Lansing, MI) to Demmer Engineering where the remainder of the unique Hurst components were added. This included black accent paint with hand-applied white pinstripes, real walnut dash trim, H/O emblems, and <b>Dual</b> <b>Gate</b> shifter and mini-console.|$|E
