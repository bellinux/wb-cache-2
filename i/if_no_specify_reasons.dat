SL and dNUM are predefined and unchangeable. MaxitN is the max iterations to ensure the convergence. Salembier [8] and Figure 3 in Section 2.2 also pointed out that 1 DARMF had an ability to provide fast convergence. If the PC 1 DARMF algorithm always set a fixed iteration numbers, it would be unnecessary and the computational cost would be tremendous. An alternative way for reducing redundant iterations is to stop the iterations when within a certain number of continuous iterations, average variation of e(itN)falls below a threshold <b>if</b> <b>no</b> <b>specified</b> information about input signal and the noise level is given.|$|R
