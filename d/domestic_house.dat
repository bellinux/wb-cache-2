25|$|In the 1830s a workhouse and {{a school}} were built inside the castle bailey. In 1844 the owner, Sir Edward Kerrison, {{demolished}} a later windmill that had been built on the motte, {{and replaced it with}} a <b>domestic</b> <b>house.</b> Kerrison had the dwelling built for his batman, who had saved his life at the battle of Waterloo in 1815. The house resembled a shell keep, and was built of flint and had living quarters built into the walls on the south and west. The building fell into ruins, being damaged in high winds during 1965 and collapsing further in 1965. It is now sometimes now referred to as Kerrison's Folly. The mound and some stone fragments of the original castle still remain intact, and the site is a scheduled monument and a Grade 1 listed building.|$|E

2500|$|The {{tradition}} of wood construction - beyond the kota hut - has been common {{throughout the entire}} northern boreal coniferous zone since prehistoric times. The central structural factor in its success was the corner joining - or [...] "corner-timbering" [...] - technique, whereby logs are laid horizontally in succession and notched at the ends to form tightly secure joints. The origins of the technique are uncertain; though it {{was used by the}} Romans in northern Europe in the first century BC, other possible older sources are said to be areas of present-day Russia, but also it {{is said to have been}} common among the Indo-Aryan peoples of Eastern Europe, the Near East, Iran and India. Crucial in the development of the [...] "corner-timbering" [...] technique were the necessary tools, primarily an axe rather than a saw. The resulting building type, a rectangular plan, originally comprising a single interior space and with a low-pitched saddle-back roof, is of the same origin as the megaron, the early Greek dwelling house. Its first use in Finland may have been as a storehouse, and later a sauna and then <b>domestic</b> <b>house.</b> The first examples of the [...] "corner-timbering" [...] technique would have used round logs, but a more developed form soon emerged, shaping logs with an axe to a square shape for a surer fit and better insulation. Hewing with an axe was seen as preferable to sawing because the axe-cut surfaces were better in abating water penetration.|$|E
