40|$|In {{designing}} a flexural member for structural safety, both the flexural {{strength and ductility}} have to be considered. For this purpose, the flexural ductility of reinforced concrete sections has been studied quite extensively. As there have been relatively few studies on the flexural ductility of prestressed concrete sections, it is not well understood how various structural parameters affect the flexural ductility. In the present study, the full-range flexural responses of reinforced and prestressed concrete sections are analyzed {{taking into account the}} nonlinearity and stress-path dependence of constitutive materials. From the numerical results, the effects of steel content, yield strength and degree of prestressing on the yield curvature and ultimate curvature are evaluated. It is found that whilst the concept of flexural ductility in terms of the ductility factor works well for reinforced sections, it can be misleading when applied to prestressed concrete sections. For prestressed concrete sections, the concept of flexural deformability in terms of ultimate curvature times overall <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>section</b> may be more appropriate. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Timber {{platform}} frame {{has evolved}} as an efficient method of construction for domestic dwellings and is experiencing continual {{growth in the}} UK due to it lending itself to off-site modem methods of construction (MMC), being environmentally efficient and exhibiting structural robustness. The challenge faced by the industry in the UK is to continue the evolutionary process such that the future demands of off-site MMC and regulatory changes are met. By conducting {{a study of the}} development of timber platform frame construction and reviewing the current and future requirements of the domestic dwelling construction market the challenges for the industry were highlighted. The business drivers of a timber platform frame manufacturer were considered and in conjunction with the information from the review an agenda of research programmes was derived. The objective of the research, although primarily from a structural timber engineering perspective, was to address the challenges faced by the industry employing a holistic approach with a view to implementing applied research. The UK procurement process for domestic dwelling construction is such that building layout is determined by architectural requirements. Building layout can have an adverse effect on structural stability and result in an inefficient system. A design review was conducted to determine the influencing factors which impinge upon system stability as a result of which recommendations for improvements were made. From the investigation the transfer of shear from a wall diaphragm to the foundation was deemed critical. Therefore, an experimental study was carried out which has resulted in an optimised specification. Further to this mathematical modelling techniques were used to demonstrate the impact that architectural layout has on stability, quantifying the financial penalty of inefficient layout and making recommendations to improve current designs. One of major priorities of the UK Government is to reduce climate change by implementing a low carbon economy with sustainable production and consumption; all with duty of care towards natural resources. Improvements to the Building Regulations (2006), in conjunction with other requirements, will result in wall U-values in domestic dwellings to be between 0. 27 to 0. 30 W/m 2 K. To determine an efficient method of meeting the new regulations an all encompassing research programme was conducted with the primary function being to develop a sustainable method of achieving thermal efficiency. Another method of wall construction is Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) and this option was reviewed. Initial work by Kermani (2005) on the structural performance of SIPs was extended to examine their racking characterisitcs with comparative studies to European and British structural codes of practice carried out. One of the key industry drivers which the review highlighted was the need for the implementation of lean technologies. The fabrication of flitch beams (timber-steel-timber sandwich configuration), used in cases of onerous load span conditions and limited <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>section,</b> was improved through the implementation of a shot fired dowel connection method. To optimise the method of fabrication and achieve implementation an extensive laboratory study was carried out the results of which are compared to European structural codes of practice with recommendations made for design. The implementation of off-site MMC methods results in a change in associated risk during construction from minor consequence and high risk to major consequence and low risk. The crane erect method of timber platform frame construction optimises on-site performance in terms of both time and cost and reduces the requirement of working at height, which on average causes almost one fatality every week. The biggest health and safety risk associated with the crane erect method is failure of the roof system when being lifted into position. Using an analytical model, verified by full scale laboratory testing, a range of lifting conditions were researched and a best practice lifting procedure was developed which allows the safe lifting of standard roof systems used in domestic dwelling construction.

40|$|A novel {{methodology}} {{is developed}} for predicting the {{load carrying capacity}} of elevated steel fibre reinforced concrete (E-SFRC) slab systems. In the proposed approach the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> slab’s cross <b>section</b> is discretized into several layers, {{and the number of}} steel fibres per each layer is determined by considering the distribution of fibres along the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> cross <b>section.</b> This information, together with the one obtained from the threepoint notched beam bending tests performed on four series of SFRC made of different concrete strength class and content of fibres, have provided the stress-crack width laws for defining the post-cracking behaviour of each layer. These constitutive laws are implemented in a numerical model developed based on the moment-rotation approach for determining the positive and negative resisting bending moment of the slab’s unit width cross section. By using the yield line theory, the load carrying capacity of ESFRC slab is predicted for the most current load conditions. Predictive performance of the proposed methodology is assessed comparing to the results recorded in experiment and the ones obtained by the numerical simulation. Finally the developed model is utilised in a parametric study to evaluate the influence of parameters that affect the load-carrying capacity of E-SFRC slabs.

In this paper we compare two techniques, one based on emission and one on absorption, applied to <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> 14 disk galaxies. The two measurements reflect, respectively, the average and apparent optical <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> a disk <b>section.</b> Hence, they depend differently on the average number and optical <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> ISM structures in the disk. The small-scale geometry of the cold ISM is critical for accurate models of the overall energy budget of spiral disks. ISM geometry, relative contributions of different stellar populations, and dust emissivity are all free parameters in galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) models; they are also sometimes degenerate, depending on wavelength coverage. Our aim is to constrain the typical ISM geometry. The apparent optical depth measurement comes {{from the number of}} distant galaxies seen in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images through the foreground disk, calibrated with the synthetic field method (SFM). We discuss what can be learned from the SFM measurement alone regarding ISM geometry. We measure the IR flux in images from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey in the same <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the disk that was covered by HST. A physical model of the dust is fit to the SED to estimate the dust surface density, mean temperature, and brightness in these disk sections.
