50|$|The Chicano {{movement}} of the 1960s, also known as El Movimiento, was a movement based on Mexican-American empowerment. It was based in ideas of community organization, nationalism {{in the form of}} cultural affirmation, and it also placed symbolic importance on ancestral ties to Meso-America. Reforms the movement called for included restoration of land grants, farm workers’ rights, and access to better educational opportunities. The movement revolved around the unity of the vast Mexican population in the US. There were a number of major events and organizations that spawned from the Chicano movement. The group participated in a number of student walkouts. Two occurred in Denver and East L.A. in 1968. These walkouts were hugely influential in the fight for equality in schools and better conditions for Chicanos. In 1970, they held the Chicano Moratorium. This was centered on opposing the Vietnam War and the complex <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination</b> the war supported. The Chicano movement was vehemently against the war and fought against it for a number of years. They even used the image of the Vietnamese as their comrade against the imperialist White-American forces. Another extremely important event for the movement was the National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference first organized by Rodolfo “Corky” Gonzales. This conference met for a number of consecutive years and its role as a unifying agent for Chicanos across the US cannot be understated. In its first meeting the conference would draft the “Plan Espiritual de Aztlán,” which would become a sort of blueprint for the Chicano movement. It starts by addressing the idea that Chicanos must utilize their nationalism as a “common denominator for mass mobilization and organization.” The document names their seven organizational goals as: unity {{in the minds of the}} people in the liberation of La Raza; economic control of their own lives and communities without exploitation; education that was relative to the Chicano; institutions that serve the people on a basis of restitution for past actions; self-defense that relies on the combined strength of the community; use of cultural values to strengthen the moral backbone of the movement; and political liberation through independent action. The document also entails actions to be made that included informing the public, performing large demonstrations and walkouts, and creating political parties and using participatory democracy. The Chicano movement is believed by some to have ended in the 1970s, but others have a view that the shift in intensity was caused by a cultural renaissance within the movement.|$|E
40|$|The central aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{understand}} why intersectionality remains at the fringes of mainstream discrimination law and to provide an alternative vision to the dominant conception of single-axis discrimination. This aim is pursued by translating intersectionality theory into the conceptual and doctrinal precincts of comparative discrimination law of South Africa, Canada and the United Kingdom. The thesis {{is divided into three}} parts. Part One posits the framework of 'intersectional integrity' as forming the backbone of the category of <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Its normative core insists on mapping the intersections between identities as creating unique and shared patterns of group disadvantage by considering peopleâs identities as a whole. It is this bipartite framework against which the doctrine is considered. Part Two deals with the doctrinal limitations which impede a successful claim of <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination.</b> The comparative analysis fine-combs through the judicial interpretation to understand how it fares against the framework of intersectional integrity. The judicial strategies emerging from the doctrinal analysis are consolidated {{in the form of a}} graded spectrum which captures the proximity of each response from the category of <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Beyond this conceptual reimagination, it also considers how other tools in discrimination law need to be recalibrated to accommodate an intersectional claim. These include the conception of equality and discrimination, the criteria for selection of analogous grounds, the understanding of indirect discrimination, the relationship between impact and justification analysis, apportioning the burden of proof and determining the standard of scrutiny. Part Three consolidates the normative insights emerging from the thesis. A restatement of the theoretical and doctrinal recalibrations helps imagine how a lawyer would walk through the labyrinth of discrimination law for realising a claim of <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} study {{described in this}} paper examines women’s perceptions of their economic opportunities and sense of empowerment in Cape Town. Although {{the status of women}} in South Africa has improved since apartheid, there are still significant inequalities among women and men in the workforce. This gender discrimination has reverberating effects on the poverty and development of South Africa as a nation, as many argue that women’s economic empowerment is directly correlated with the overall growth of a country. South African policymakers would benefit from comparing and analyzing women’s views of their own economic opportunities, as this study highlights that women experience complex forms of discrimination based on their identities in society today. The participants of this small-scale qualitative {{research study}} are seven women of diverse races and ages. The synthesis of this cross-racial and generational research provides a non-representative sample of the concerns of women in Cape Town regarding economic empowerment. From these interviews it was found that cultural upbringing is a highly influential factor in women’s economic success that can significantly limit or promote women’s economic empowerment. This research also highlighted underlying insecurities that many women in the workforce feel regarding their professional abilities and value, an issue that results from intersectional oppressions experienced by women and from apartheid’s legacies of patriarchal power dynamics. Overall, {{the findings of this study}} suggest that women’s experiences with economic empowerment depend greatly on their unique culture and family structure, rather than purely racial and class distinctions. This research highlights the <b>intersectional</b> gender <b>discrimination</b> faced by women in Cape Town and emphasizes the need to address oppressive remnants of apartheid in South Africa today...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{there has been a}} {{significant}} broadening of the legal protection against discrimination in Norway. Adding to a comparatively strong gender equality legislation, the protection against discrimination has been expanded through a series of legal regulations to cover ethnicity, national origin, language, religion, sexual orientation, disability and age, quite in line with recent EU developments and with the gradual strengthening of the international human rights regime. A major concern regarding these reform processes {{is the extent to which}} multiple and/or <b>intersectional</b> forms of <b>discrimination</b> are adequately addressed. In this article we examine the position of intersectional framings in recent legislative and monitoring reforms, and through the judicial practice of the new monitoring agencies. Multiple ground complaints constitute a minor, but increasing part of the cases handled by the Norwegian Equality and Anti-discrimination Ombud and the adjudicating Equality Tribunal. A closer examination of selected cases shows how there is a scale of possible conceptualizations of the ‘discrimination problem’ at hand which is open in the sense that cases of multiple discrimination could move into an area of intersectional problematic...|$|R

40|$|Gender {{identity}} is a burgeoning topic as people increasingly {{present to the}} National Health Service for assistance with gender incongruence concerns. The fluidity of gender and unique transition experience warrant further exploration given increased visibility of this topic. Also, with growing prevalence rates of people identifying as transgender, it is paramount the attitudinal responses of health care providers are investigated, given their crucial role in forging therapeutic relationships. This thesis informs understanding of transition experiences and current knowledge of mental health practitioners’ attitudes towards the transgender population. Chapter one is a critical systematic review of quantitative and mixed methodology research exploring mental health professionals’ attitudes towards transgender people. Database and manual searches revealed thirteen studies appropriate for inclusion. Mental health professionals report overall positive attitudes; however, demographic variables were found to influence attitudes. The review highlights inadequate scales that conflate sub-populations of transgender people and were often adapted from scales measuring attitudes towards sexual orientation. Areas for future research are discussed. Chapter two is a qualitative research study that explored the lived experience of transition with six Male to Female transgender participants. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis emergent findings relate to transition heterogeneity, <b>intersectional</b> forms of <b>discrimination,</b> and, authentic identity expression post-transition. Clinical and service implications are discussed alongside areas of future research. Chapter three is a reflective account applying relevant theories of intersectionality to the researcher’s self, research process and experiences while on the doctorate. It explores the parallels between the research area and facets influencing identity transition before embarking on professional qualification. ...|$|R
40|$|Martine Hawkes {{reports on}} the {{discussion}} of transcultural mental health at the TheMHS 2010 Conference  THIS YEAR the TheMHS Annual Conference celebrated its twentieth year. Held at the Sydney Convention Centre, Darling Harbour last month, the event attracted over one thousand participants including mental health clinicians, managers, consumers, carers, diversity workers, researchers, educators and policy makers. One {{of the features of}} this year’s conference was the inclusion of a very strong transcultural mental health focus, which saw the inclusion of three keynote addresses and a film festival with a transcultural focus as well as a large number of transcultural sessions. This inclusion of this focus came through this year’s collaboration with two conferences being held concurrently with TheMHS: the Mental Wellbeing Conference 2010 and Transcultural Mental Health (NSW). Maria Cassaniti, Centre Coordinator of the Transcultural Mental Health Centre commented during the closing ceremony of the conference that the inclusion of the transcultural theme “re-energised ‘where to’ for the future. ” This was echoed by Australian of the Year, Patrick McGorry, in his closing address, in which he noted that this year’s conference would “demolish the idea that we are not unified as a sector and as a society. ” This sectoral unity was particular apparent in the variety of papers presented during the transcultural sessions by representatives of organisations and programs which are not exclusively transcultural in their focus. A particular highlight of the TheMHS transcultural focus was Derrick Silove’s keynote address, “Meeting the Challenges of Transcultural Psychiatry. ” Most significant in this paper was Derrick’s questioning of the apparent taboos around {{the use of the word}} “multiculturalism” in public discourse in particular, with a particular interrogation of what the absence or elision of this word (and possibly of the concept also) might mean for mental health. Derrick highlighted a risk here of oversimplifying – for advocacy and policy requirements – the complexity of multiculturalism. Derrick concluded his paper by highlighting the regional responsibilities of Australia as regards mental health. He noted that Australia’s closest neighbours have some of the poorest mental health facilities in the world. This was a theme that was later picked up by Jane Henty’s report of her experience of a reciprocal learning program for Australian mental health practitioners in Fiji. While reflecting on the benefits of this participation on her own practice, Jane also provided an important overview of the mental health in the region, adding more urgency to Derrick’s call for recognition of regional responsibilities. Other highlights of the transcultural focus included George Klein’s “Never Before I Came Here: Substance Abuse and Social Adjustment,” in which a very clear and illuminating use of Stimson’s matrix of a drug user and Kitano’s ethno-cultural identity matrix provided clear intersections of knowledge for mental health (particularly around the issue of substance abuse) and transcultural practice. Other illuminating intersections between mental health practice and refugee communities in particular were provided by Jorge Aroche, Shakeh Monmartin, Mirjana Askovic and Mariano Coello of STARTTS. Of interest here were the various discussions of the use of new assessment tools in working with torture and trauma survivors. Yet, amid the many concurrent sessions taking place, the attendees at the transcultural sessions were the same faces – often giving the illusion that I was attending a conference of only twenty people instead of over a thousand. This creates the (perhaps unavoidable) problem that the only people receiving information about new developments in transcultural mental health are those who are – gauged from conversations with other attendees – already very much engaged in the transcultural sector. This somewhat limits an engagement with intersectional issues. The opportunity for a more informal intersectional engagement came from the inclusion of a film festival in this year’s conference. Two films – It Can be Done (Giulio Manfredonia) and In the City of the Mad (Marco Turco) – were shown over the three nights of the conference. Both films took as their focus the operation of and subsequent closure of Italy’s psychiatric hospitals under the Basaglia law. The inclusion of this film festival provided a wonderful opportunity for more informal discussion and networking, and will hopefully be a repeated feature of future TheMHS conferences. Overall, the inclusion of the transcultural focus through the collaboration with Transcultural Mental Health provided for a shift towards an examination of issues of <b>intersectional</b> diversity (and <b>discrimination)</b> that has gradually been growing in the sector. It is hoped that this focus on intersectionality – perhaps more intermingled in the program – is a focus that shall continue for TheMHS. • Copies of the Book of Proceedings of the conference can be purchased from TheMHS office by emailing: info@themhs. org. In 2011 the TheMHS conference will take place in Adelaide – the city that hosted the first TheMHS conference in 1990 – where “Resilience and change” will be the theme.

40|$|Through the U visa, the Immigration and Nationality Act {{offers a}} means to obtain legal {{immigration}} status for undocumented {{victims of domestic violence}} and other specified crimes who cooperate with law enforcement in the investigation or prosecution of those crimes. In order to apply for such a visa, a crime victim must obtain law enforcement certification that he or she has been, is being, or will be helpful to the investigation or prosecution of the crime. This Note argues that the Act’s provision of discretion to local law enforcement officials in the decision of whether to grant U visa certification requests violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, at least as applied to battered undocumented Latina immigrants in Suffolk County, New York. The Note uses certification denials to critique the equal protection doctrine in the United States and to show how the Inter-American human rights system’s conception of equal protection would better address the <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination</b> faced by undocumented victims of domestic violence. The Note discusses the ways in which interrelated forms of discrimination lead to unconstitutional denials of U visa certification requests. It then predicts the outcome of a potential suit based on the equal protection violation inherent in a discriminatory certification denial before domestic courts and before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. It argues that such a suit would have a much greater chance of success in the latter system. Finally, acknowledging the limited practical effect of a successful claim before the Commission, the Note proposes a domestic grassroots movement to more meaningfully address the <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination</b> that faces battered undocumented women...|$|E

Drawing upon selected elements {{of the findings of}} our Neskak Gora Project - a qualitative research conducted between 2009 and 2011 in Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK and funded by the EC Daphne III Programme - we show that the intersection of class, gender and ‘race’/ethnicity, which is at play at the structural, institutional and discursive levels of systems of <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination,</b> works in variable ways. While gendered educational structures seem partly to benefit female immigrant youth at school, gendered disadvantages are experienced particularly in the transition to the labour market.

40|$|The {{concept of}} multiple-discrimination, {{particularly}} {{as found in}} the labor market, is fast becoming common parlance among policy-making circles. Understanding discrimination is no longer about uncovering simple and dualistic links between two social groups: it is increasingly apparent that the nature and dynamics of discrimination are complex because the multiple positions occupied by people are shaped by numerous social attributes. Economic theory and economists, however, have hardly addressed issues of multiple-discrimination or <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination.</b> By surveying the economics literature, from orthodoxy to heterodoxy, this article shows how economists are lagging behind legal and human rights theorists in tackling the issue.

The value of this project extends beyond the act of recording an oral history, given the <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination</b> experienced by the participants as women of color, immigrants, and members of the working class.

Using literature, quantitative data analysis and qualitative semi-structured interviews analyzed via thematic analysis, this study examines how Somali Canadian male youth experience integration into Canadian society and become shaped by political, social and environmental conditions that differ from Somalia. Results from this study reveal that Somali Canadian male youth deviance and criminality is affected by 1) identity issues stemming from culture shock and <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination</b> (cultural, religious and racial), 2) lack of parental integration into Canadian society, and 3) post-migration socioeconomic challenges. These findings highlight the need for policy options that support the building of a healthy self-image of Somali Canadian male youth and empower Somali refugee parents to advocate for themselves and their children.

40|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of the more recent similar expansion of the anti-discrimination framework at EU level, this article reviews the operation of the last five years of Ireland's expanded anti-discrimination framework which brought an extension of the discriminatory grounds from two to a total of nine. In particular, it raises questions as to the claimed effectiveness of the EU framework from the perspective of those, particularly women, who identify across multiple grounds. This is evidenced through a review of some of the conceptual and practical problems that inhere in an anti-discrimination structure that is predicated upon a strict categorical-comparator approach to identity and disadvantage. In particular, the way in which women with compound identities experience <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination</b> remains unaddressed by dominant conceptions of single category definitions of direct and indirect discri-mination. Yet the acknowledged reality of women as victims of multiple discrimina-tion appears to be outwith the structures of the newly expanded legislation. Thus, far from being an effective basis for addressing multiple discrimination, the Irish experi-ence demonstrates again, that at the level of individual enforcement, the well-worn criticisms of the anti-discrimination framework remain firmly embedded in the expanded regulations...|$|E

This shift recognises the established importance of post-release accommodation and individual case management for ex-prisoners as important steps towards addressing the high rates of re-incarceration of people in NSW. However, like the vast majority of such services, this latest measure does not sufficiently respond to the specific issues facing Aboriginal women, who are experiencing the fastest rate of increase of all groups of prisoners across Australia. Aboriginal women have higher rates of return to prison, higher rates of social and physical disadvantage, and higher numbers of dependent children than their non-Aboriginal counterparts. Their specific experiences of <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination</b> on the grounds of their race and gender remain largely invisible to policy makers.

30|$|Sports {{reporter}} Karen Crouse {{summarizes the}} media attention of female athletes as two extremes—“the sum total of her physical assets–or invisible” [53]. Perception as a feminine and attractive woman equates to acceptance yet sexual objectification {{in the world of}} sports, whereas perception as too masculine equates social deviance and lesbianism [54, 55]. This contradiction between femininity and athleticism leads to a position of social invisibility and belittles the role of the female athlete in sport participation [56]. Contrary to the common perception that sexual minority females are more athletic than heterosexual peers and overrepresented in sport, LGBT females engage in less moderate to vigorous physical activity and team sports than heterosexual peers in early adolescence [57]. Additionally, sport climates are often worse for lesbians who are also racial minorities, as they face a unique challenge of <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination</b> based on race, sexual orientation, and gender. Walker and Melton explored this sexual prejudice of minority lesbians in intercollegiate sports and reported that all participants felt that it was typical to hide sexuality when working in intercollegiate sports, most likely because the white, heterosexual, and male-dominated administration would not be accepting [58]. Many believed that refusing to conform to traditional gender norms would drastically reduce career opportunities, so instead they reported managing expression of their sexual orientation in the workplace {{to be more of a}} barrier than their racial identity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This thesis {{show how}} the European Community, through {{legislation}} and case law, is addressing the problem of multiple discrimination and what the possible solutions to it are. Multiple discrimination describes a situation where an individual experiences discrimination {{on more than one}} ground. This can occur in two different ways; additive or intersectional. Additive discrimination describes a situation where an individual is discriminated against on more than one ground and these grounds are added on top of each other. <b>Intersectional</b> <b>discrimination</b> explains how an individual’s multiple identities may be the cause of discrimination {{in such a way that}} the grounds for discrimination cannot be considered separately. Expanding the list of grounds in Article 13 EC could help multiple discrimination claims but cannot be seen as the exclusive solution to such a complex problem. Many more problems surround multiple discrimination claims. One is to find an adequate comparator in order to prove discrimination. Another is that the case law shows a higher rate of success for plaintiffs claiming only one ground of discrimination even if they have experienced multiple discrimination, causing a disparity between the facts of the case and the reality experienced by the plaintiffs. In conclusion, such a complex matter cannot be solved by one simple solution but the Community would benefit from an explicit prohibition as well as a common definition of multiple discrimination...|$|E
40|$|<b>Intersectional</b> <b>discrimination</b> {{challenges}} {{not only}} the structure of equality law, but also the techniques that lawyers employ in assessing and arguing discrimination cases. Client forms, akin to questionnaires, assist lawyers in obtaining a full picture of the client’s circumstances and in avoiding the omission of any potential legal remedies. Chronologies of events assist lawyers in mapping discriminatory events and estab-lishing that the client is within the time limit for submitting a claim to the Employ-ment Tribunal. These techniques reflect discrimination law’s defensiveness against lived complexities, which in itself restricts possible intersectional analyses. For example, through chronologies, each discriminatory event is defined by reference to only one ‘ground’. Discrimination law therefore links the passing of time itself to the categories it has produced. In this context, Homi Bhabha’s concept of hybridity provides a useful way of describing how intersectional subjects relate to their categorization through law. It shows how legal subjects simultaneously adopt and resist the grounds that lawyers use to describe their experiences. If discrimination law is based on enabling legal subjects to speak for themselves, then we should investi-gate these possibilities for resistance.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of multiple discrimination {{has been recognized}} in international law and {{the law of the}} European Union, subse¬quently the gender and anti-discrimination Directives, but it was not clearly defined. Thus effective protection and mechanisms for countering discrimination on multiple grounds such as racial or ethnic origin, gender, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation are lacking across the board. European experiences show that there is the risk of not efficiently covering this type of discrimination with the structure of the existing anti-discrimination legislation. This paper elaborates the position of multiple discrimination in the existing anti-discrimination legislation, specifically the European Union law. The paper analyzes the types of multiple discrimination, such as cumulative or additional discrimination and <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Furthermore, the paper identifies the key challenges linked with protection of multiple discrimination cases, such as differences in the substantive and in the personal coverage of the anti-discrimination legislation, differences in the exceptions of specific discriminatory grounds, and difficulties in finding a comparator in cases of indirect multiple discrimination. Finally, the paper presents ways forward in countering multiple discrimination, especially the use of Article 14 from the European Convention on Human Rights, which contains an open list of grounds and a general justification, as well as some progressive national legislations such as the Irish Equal Status Act or the German General Act on Equal Treatment.

40|$|DEMO: India-EU MaP - Developing Evidence based Management and Operations in India-EU Migration and PartnershipThis report {{provides}} an overview of existing social science knowledge about Norwegian residents of Indian origin. This is relevant for policy makers in Europe and India, because the Norwegian case, in spite of its small size, is well documented. On this basis, the report theorizes how diasporas produce economic development. The report starts with a critical literature review, and proceeds with thematic chapters on history, demography, socio-economic integration, legal framework, and socio-cultural integration. For each topic, the report summarizes findings from all existing quantitative and qualitative research, showing the Indian diaspora to be a particularly successful non-Western minority in a Western host country. The report, therefore, gives some sense of why the Indian diaspora in Norway is interpreted as successful case of economic and cultural integration. But the report also addresses the level of international integration, in economic and cultural terms, between the areas of arrival and the areas of origin. Pushing beyond the limitations of methodological nationalism, the report conceptualizes diaspora communities as transnational social capital, which contribute to future economic development, within the historical context of geographically uneven development. The report discusses the conceptual implications regarding key issues like internal and external colonialism, <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination,</b> national cultural plurality, and remittances as development strategy. In sum, the report suggests an approach for future diaspora research. The phenomena of socio-economic and socio-cultural ﾓintegrationﾔ should be discussed not only within a national context, as an issue of inclusion within a host nation, but also transnationally, as an issue of ties or even fellowship between different nations...|$|E

In this article, I focus on particular concepts of femininity in selected texts of two outstanding writers of different generations, a prose writer, and a woman poet: Mahasweta Debi (b. 1926) and Mallika Sengupta (1960 – 2011). Analyzing Mahasweta’s female characters, I focus on the issue of the double marginalization of dalit tribal women; we can find here impacts of <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination</b> of class, gender and caste. Debi is very radical in her social criticism but is quite reluctant to accept the label of feminism. Mallika, on the other hand, represents a movement among the female writers of her generation that openly declares her support for feminist ideologies, which can be demonstrated on some of the examples referred to here. Another important strand of Mallika’s constructions of femininity are archetypal images — mythological metaphors of femininity (in the Hindu context) which may in some cases be interpreted in accordance with difference feminism, in others as a critique of the essentialized and dichotomous concepts of masculinity and femininity. While Mahasweta’s emancipation drive is more deeply grounded in her field research and journalistic activism in the tribal areas she writes about, Mallika’s has been more strongly linked with the academia and has joined the theoretical feminist discourse. Through a close reading the women’s emancipation discourse of these two protagonists in Bengali literature, we can speak of a shift from a practical, concrete criticism, to a theoretically founded radicalism...|$|E
40|$|And They Entered as Ladies: When Race, Class and Black Femininity Clashed at Central High School,” {{explores the}} {{intersectionality}} of race, gender and class status as middle-class black women led the integration movement {{and were the}} focal point of white backlash during the 1957 Little Rock Central High School crisis. Six of the nine black students chosen to integrate Central High School were carefully selected girls from middle-class homes, whose mothers and female family members played active parts in keeping their daughters enrolled at Central, while Daisy Gatson Bates orchestrated the integration of the capital’s school system. Nevertheless, these women have generally been examined through the lens of black male activism or as catalysts for white women’s gendered and social fears. The marginalization of these women’s experiences at Central High ignores their uniquely gendered and racialized challenges that factored profoundly in the violent defense of white supremacy that targeted middle-class black femininity, and women who bore every credential for the title of Southern 2 ̆ 7 lady 2 ̆ 7 [...] except for skin color. These women, their motivations and experiences in a pivotal moment in civil rights history must be examined with the same gravity that has been afforded to the singular racial component of the Little Rock school crisis, {{as well as to the}} gender and class explorations that have been afforded to segregationist, moderate, and liberal white participants. My work will expand our understanding of the social crisis in the Arkansas capitol, center the voices of black Arkansan women in the historical record, and provide a springboard for understanding how black women have organized for social justice, been marginalized in those same movements, and transcended <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination</b> across the nation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Preventive health {{services}} (PHSs) {{form part of}} primary healthcare {{with the aim of}} screening to prevent disease. Migrants show significant differences in lifestyle, health beliefs and risk factors compared with the native populations. This can {{have a significant impact on}} migrants’ access to health systems and participation in prevention programmes. Even in countries with widely accessible healthcare systems, migrants’ access to PHSs may be difficult. The aim of the study was to compare access to preventive {{health services}} between migrants and native populations in five European Union (EU) countries. Methods: Information from Health Interview Surveys of Belgium, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Spain were used to analyse access to mammography, Pap smear tests, colorectal cancer screening and flu vaccination among migrants. The comparative risk of not accessing PHSs was calculated using a mixed-effects multilevel model, adjusting for potential confounding factors (sex, education and the presence of disability). Migrant status was defined according to citizenship, with a distinction made between EU and non-EU countries. Results: Migrants, in particular those from non-EU countries, were found to have poorer access to PHSs. The overall risk of not reporting a screening test or a flu vaccination ranged from a minimum of 1. 8 times (colorectal cancer screening), to a high of 4. 4 times (flu vaccination) for migrants. The comparison among the five EU countries included in the study showed similarities, with particularly limited access recorded in Italy and in Belgium for non-EU migrants. Conclusions: The findings of this study are in accordance with evidence from the scientific literature. Poor organization of health services, in Italy, and lack of targeted health policies in Belgium may explain these findings. PHSs should be responsive to patient diversity, probably more so than other health services. There is a need for diversity-oriented, migrant-sensitive prevention. Policies oriented to removing impediments to migrants’ access to preventive interventions are crucial, to encourage more positive action for those facing the risk of <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Authors are thankful to FCT for funds to GHTM – UID/Multi/ 04413 / 2013...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{the right to}} social security in international human rights law from a gender perspective. The right to social security is of increasing importance in framing efforts to address poverty. Since, throughout the world, poverty is deeply gendered, {{it is important to}} ensure that the right to social security is interpreted from a gender perspective with the achievement of gender equality as a central objective. The gender perspective developed in this thesis draws on feminist theory to reinterpret ideas of ‘work’ within the definition of the right to social security. It recognises the diversity of women and the need to address <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination.</b> It uses a substantive equality approach to propose a set of principles for a substantively equal, gendered right to social security. The thesis applies this conceptual framework and set of principles to an analysis of international law looking specifically at the work of four United Nations’ bodies: the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women; the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Labour Organisation and the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights. The framework and principles are also applied to an analysis of three country studies (South Africa, Australia and India). Specific aspects of the social security systems of each country are selected for examination within the country studies to undertake a deeper evaluation in terms of the framework and principles. The thesis concludes that the framework and principles could be used effectively within international law to ensure that a gender perspective is built into the interpretation of the right to social security. The thesis finds that in each country studied, there could be improvements to the social security programmes to advance the rights of women and to promote gender equality. The approach to the right to social security developed in the thesis can assist in reshaping the way the right is understood and applied to advance gender equality and address gendered poverty...|$|E
40|$|The New Labour era has {{witnessed}} {{a sea change}} in LGBT equality in the UK, in terms of public opinion, legislation, and equality implementation mechanisms. There has been a cultural shift towards valuing diversity, so that to a degree, LGBT identities have become normalised. The raft of equalities legislation (as well as the repeal of Section 28) underpins this shift, as do developments such as the introduction of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission. Changes have also taken place in the communities, including a movement towards the combination of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people within the LGBT acronym, and the professionalisation of the community sector to a degree. There are still substantial challenges concerning LGBT equalities. The inequalities that LGBT people may face are particularly stark when multiple disadvantage and <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination</b> are considered, including inequalities relating to ethnicity, gender, spatiality, and socio-economic class. Bisexuality is routinely included within the LGBT acronym, but this inclusion is largely rhetorical, and prejudice towards bisexuals exists in both the lesbian and gay, and heterosexual, communities. Transgender people who fit into the gender-reassigning model are now well supported by the legislation, but the situation may be more difficult for trans people who identify outside of the gender binary system. This talk addresses the above issues, drawing on empirical material from a large Economic and Social Research Council-funded examination of the impact of recent policy changes, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, on sexualities equalities initiatives. The project involved in depth qualitative research with four local authorities selected to include those in which little equalities work concerning sexuality and transgender was taking place. We organised Action Learning Sets in Northern Ireland, Wales, and Northern and Southern England, facilitating local authority actors in engaging – together with community activists and statutory partners in some cases – with the key issues in conducting sexuality and transgender equalities work...|$|E
40|$|Discrimination may {{contribute}} to poorer health outcomes experienced by non-dominant social groups. While discrimination and health research has flourished {{over the past two}} decades, little {{attention has been paid to}} the assessment of multiple forms of discrimination, nor to the health effects of discrimination for transgender persons in Canada. Therefore, this thesis examines the impacts of discrimination on health behaviours among transgender persons in Ontario and develops a new instrument set for evaluating self-reported discrimination irrespective of attribution, the <b>Intersectional</b> <b>Discrimination</b> Index (InDI). The first four manuscripts draw on data from the Trans PULSE Project, a respondent-driven sampling survey of transgender Ontarians aged 16 + conducted in 2009 - 2010 (n= 433). Analyses were weighted using RDS-II methods, and odds ratios or prevalence ratios were estimated from logistic regression models to identify the impacts of discrimination, social exclusion, and gender transition. The first manuscript investigates correlates of both past-year HIV-related sexual risk and sexual inactivity among transfeminine (male-to-female spectrum) persons. Genital surgery for gender transition was independently associated with lower odds of both outcomes. Discrimination was not associated with sexual risk overall, but sensitivity analyses found that correlates differed by type of sexual risk behaviour. The second manuscript examines HIV-related sexual risk among transmasculine (female-to-male spectrum) persons who are gay, bisexual, or have sex with men. Known correlates of sexual risk among cisgender gay and bisexual men were similarly predictive of risk in this population, including sexual abuse, stimulant use, and depressive symptoms. The third and fourth manuscripts focus on heavy episodic drinking (HED) and illicit drug use, respectively, among all transgender Ontarians. HED, cocaine use, and amphetamine use were more common among transgender Ontarians than expected based on the age-standardized reference population. HED was associated with transmasculine gender and sex work, but not with discrimination. Illicit drug use was associated with anti-transgender violence, homelessness or underhousing, and sex work. The final manuscript describes the development and validation of the InDI, which includes three components measuring anticipated, day-to-day, and major discrimination. The bi-national validity and reliability study found consistent evidence of construct validity and test-retest reliability. Finally, implications and future research directions are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Citizens Advice Administrative Dataset provides information regarding all Citizens Advice clients in England and Wales from April 2008. In particular, Citizens Advice is the national organisation responsible for providing advice and support for problems and issues faced by the public in England and Wales. Advice is provided by 384 Citizens Advice Bureaux (all independent charities) in England and Wales. There are separate national Citizens Advice organisations and CABx in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Citizens Advice {{is one of the}} largest volunteer organisations in the UK, with over 20, 000 volunteers. The service was established in 1939 just after the outbreak of the Second World War to offer members of the public general advice with their problems. The twin aims of Citizens Advice are to provide advice for problems that people have and to improve both the policies and practices which will affect people’s lives. The service offers advice and assistance in many areas including welfare benefits, debt, employment, housing, relationships, consumer issues and health. All Citizens Advice clients that enter a bureau are recorded onto a single database. A single record is created for that client and is updated every time they return to the same bureau. The client record collects information on the client profile (covering age, gender, ethnicity, disability and location of the client), the broad issue that the client seeks advice on (such as benefit, debt), the detail of the problem (such as the type of debt or benefit) and a third category which describes the nature of the advice given. The Bureaux record details of outcomes on a sample basis (approximately 7 %) covering advice outcomes (such the amount of benefit gained, debt managed or written off and employment tribunals won) and client outcomes (such as impact on health, relationships and confidence). At the moment advice outcomes are recorded in the case management system. Citizens Advice covers England and Wales only. Similar organisations exist in Scotland and Northern Ireland and together they form the Citizens Advice service network for the UK. Citizens Advice data is available from April 2008. External data is published quarterly six weeks after the end of each quarter. Internal data is consolidated around two to three weeks after each quarter. Data is available monthly for reporting and some data can be accessed in ‘real time’. Data collected in each client’s record is updated each time that they re-visit a bureau and when an outcome from any advice or support becomes available. Note that at present, a separate record is created if a client visits a different bureau. In the future, Citizens Advice plan to collect data onto one centralised system. Citizens Advice will consider applications for their micro level data providing that the research can demonstrate the impact of the Citizens Advice and cover key areas that they provide advice and support for, such as employment issues, discrimination, tribunals, welfare benefits, debt and housing. Research Usage and Linkage The Citizens Advice data is used to look at the problems people are experiencing and how this compares by geography, client profile and over time. Data has been used to inform research by the Government Equalities Office on <b>intersectional</b> <b>discrimination</b> and to look at how the recession was affecting different groups of people. Data was used as part of research by BIS on vulnerable workers. The data has also been used to inform the Cabinet Office on potential avoidable contacts in relation to benefit administration, used to look at the value of services and the return on investment and is routinely used to inform and support a wide range of policy work. Citizens Advice data has not been linked with any other datasets. In theory, it should be possible to link to other datasets using probabilistic matching techniques. </div...|$|E
