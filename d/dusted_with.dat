25|$|The most {{frequently}} used meat is pork, followed by beef, lamb, chicken, rabbit, duck and goose; for immediate consumption it is often grilled, or <b>dusted</b> <b>with</b> breadcrumbs and sauteed, in a dish similar to schnitzel. For bigger gatherings, oven roasts are prepared. The need for meat preservation no longer presents the urgency that it did during the Soviet occupation or previous times of trouble, but many favorite techniques survive, include brining, salting, drying and smoking. There are many varieties of smoked pork, including ham and a soft sausage with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches.|$|E

25|$|Before any procedures, the oreo {{cookies are}} frozen for 3 hours {{and the oil}} is {{preheated}} to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. After that, the buttermilk pancake mix is stirred with {{the water in a}} mixing bowl. The oreo cookies are dipped in the mixture, making sure the oreo is fully covered with the batter. The coated oreo cookies are then dropped into hot oil until the cookies turn golden brown. The cookies are removed from the oil and placed on a sheet pan with paper towels for draining the excessive oil.

25|$|In spring, {{the plant}} {{produces}} large, yellow flowers with 5-fold symmetry. The yellow petals {{are long and}} strap-like, and dangle over the umbrella-like style of the flower, which is held upside {{down at the end}} of a 50cm long scape. The stigma of the flower are found at the tips of the 'spokes' of this umbrella. Pollinating insects generally enter the flower from above, forcing their way into the cavity between the petals and umbrella, and depositing any pollen they are carrying on the stigmata as they enter. The pollinators generally exit the flower, having been <b>dusted</b> <b>with</b> the plant's own pollen, by lifting a petal. This one-way system helps to ensure cross pollination.|$|E

500|$|The old-fashioned {{doughnut}} is {{a variety}} of cake doughnut prepared {{in the shape of}} a ring with tapered edges around it. Cake doughnuts originated in the United States circa 1829.

It is typically deep fried, may have a crunchier or crisper texture compared to other styles of cake doughnuts, and typically has cracks and pores on its surface.

500|$|Mycena adscendens, {{commonly}} known as the frosty bonnet, is a species of fungus in the family Mycenaceae. The fungus produces small white fruit bodies (mushrooms) with caps up to [...] in diameter that appear to be <b>dusted</b> <b>with</b> sugar-like granules. Caps are supported by thin, hollow stems up to [...] long, which are set on a disc-like base. It is distributed in the United States, where it has been found from Washington to California, Europe, and Turkey. The fruit bodies grow on fallen twigs and other woody debris on the forest floor, including fallen hazel nuts. The variety carpophila is known from Japan. There are several small white Mycena species that are similar in appearance to M.adscendens, some of which can be reliably distinguished only by examining microscopic characteristics.|$|E

500|$|The gills have an adnate {{attachment}} to the cap, are narrow to moderately broad, closely spaced, and eventually separate from the stem. Young gills are cinnamon-brown in color, with lighter edges, but darken in maturity because they become covered with the dark spores. The stem is [...] long by [...] thick, and roughly equal in width throughout except for a slightly enlarged base. The lower region of the stem is brownish in color and has silky [...] "hairs" [...] pressed against the stem; the upper region is grayish and pruinose (lightly <b>dusted</b> <b>with</b> powdery white granules). The flesh turns slightly bluish or greenish {{where it has been}} injured. The application of a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide solution on the cap or flesh will cause a color change to pale to dark yellowish to reddish brown; a drop on the stem produces a less intense or no color change.|$|E

500|$|Utamaro was {{the leading}} ukiyo-e artist in the 1790s in the [...] genre of {{pictures}} of female beauties. [...] He {{was known for his}} , which focus on the heads. [...] The three models in Three Beauties of the Present Day were frequent subjects of Utamaro's portraiture. [...] Each figure in the work is adorned with an identifying family crest. [...] The portraits are idealized, and at first glance their faces seem similar, but subtle differences in their features and expressions can be detected—a level of realism at the time unusual in ukiyo-e, and a contrast with the stereotyped beauties in earlier masters such as Harunobu and Kiyonaga. [...] The luxurious print was published by Tsutaya Jūzaburō and made with multiple woodblocks—one for each colour—and the background was <b>dusted</b> <b>with</b> muscovite to produce a glimmering effect. [...] It {{is believed to have been}} quite popular, and the triangular positioning became a vogue in the 1790s. [...] Utamaro produced several other pictures with the same arrangement of the same three beauties, and all three appeared in numerous other portraits by Utamaro and other artists.|$|E

500|$|The cap is {{initially}} egg-shaped in young specimens, but changes shape as it matures, becoming convex and later {{more or less}} flat with a central depression. At {{the center of the}} cap is a roughly spherical umbo – a nipple-like protrusion. The cap is hygrophanous, meaning it changes color depending on its state of hydration: the color is tawny in moist specimens, changing to ochre with dark brown edges when dried. The cap diameter is typically , with a surface that is smooth, and almost gelatinous in consistency. The edge of the cap is thin and wavy, and is often split open. The gills are broadly adnate (broadly attached to the stalk slightly above the bottom of the gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem) to slightly decurrent (running {{down the length of the}} stem). Interspersed between the gills are shorter gills, called lamellulae, that start from the cap but do not reach the stem. The gills are broad (up to 4mm) and thick at the base (1mm), and when mature can develop veins that run between the gills on the undersurface of the cap. The stem is [...] long, [...] thick, and usually attached centrally to the underside of the cap, although it may sometimes be slightly off-center.
