The Papo Seco Formation of Portugal where Baryonyx has been {{identified}} is composed of marl, representing a lagoon environment. Other dinosaur remains from the area include fragments tentatively assigned to Mantellisaurus, a macronarian sauropod, and Megalosaurus. Most of the bones of Portuguese specimen ML1190 were damaged, and some scratches may be marks from small scavengers. The specimen's <b>disarticulation</b> indicates it was transported from a more-terrestrial environment (since many bones are missing), but those found were close together.|$|E
5|$|Remains {{thought to}} belong to Nigersaurus were first {{discovered}} during a 1965–72 expedition to the Republic of Niger led by French paleontologist Philippe Taquet, and first mentioned in a paper published in 1976. Although a common genus, the dinosaur had been poorly known until more material of other individuals was discovered during expeditions led by American palaeontologist Paul Sereno in 1997 and 2000. The limited understanding of the genus {{was the result of}} poor preservation of its remains, which arises from the delicate and highly pneumatic construction of the skull and skeleton, in turn causing <b>disarticulation</b> of the fossils. Some of the skull fossils were so thin that a strong light beam was visible through them. Therefore, no intact skulls or articulated skeletons have been found, and these specimens represent the most complete known rebbachisaurid remains.|$|E
5|$|Charig and Milner {{presented}} a possible scenario explaining the taphonomy (changes during fossilisation) of the B. walkeri holotype specimen. The fine-grained sediments around the skeleton, {{and the fact}} that the bones were found close together (skull and forelimb elements at one end of the excavation area and the pelvis and hind-limb elements at the other), indicates that the environment was quiet at the time of fossilisation and water currents did not carry the carcass far—possibly because the water was shallow. The area where the specimen died seems to have been suitable for a piscivorous animal. It may have caught fish and scavenged on the mud plain, becoming mired before it died and was buried. Since the bones are well-preserved and had no gnaw marks, the carcass appears to have been undisturbed by scavengers (suggesting that it was quickly covered by sediment). The <b>disarticulation</b> of the bones may have been the result of soft-tissue decomposition. Parts of the skeleton seem to have weathered to different degrees, perhaps because water levels changed or the sediments shifted (exposing parts of the skeleton). The girdle and limb bones, the dentary, and a rib were broken before fossilisation, perhaps from trampling by large animals while buried. The orientation of the bones indicates that the carcass lay on its back, which may explain why all the lower teeth had fallen out of their sockets and some upper teeth were still in place.|$|E

25|$|Death during {{hibernation}} was {{a common}} end for cave bears, mainly befalling specimens that failed ecologically during the summer season through inexperience, sickness or old age. Some cave bear bones show signs of numerous ailments, including spinal fusion, bone tumours, cavities, tooth resorption, necrosis (particularly in younger specimens), osteomyelitis, periostitis, rickets and kidney stones. Male cave bear skeletons have been found with broken bacula, probably due to fighting during the breeding season. Cave bear longevity is unknown, though {{it has been estimated}} that they seldom exceeded twenty years of age. Paleontologists doubt adult cave bears had any natural predators, save for pack-hunting wolves and cave hyenas, which would probably have attacked sick or infirm specimens. Cave hyenas are thought to be responsible for the <b>disarticulation</b> and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for the hyenas, especially at the end of the winter, when food was scarce. The presence of fully articulated adult cave lion skeletons, deep in cave bear dens, indicates the lions may have occasionally entered dens to prey on hibernating cave bears, with some dying in the attempt.|$|E

500|$|Although {{sporadic}} work at {{what became}} known as the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Emery County, Utah had taken place as early as 1927, and the fossil site itself described by William L. Stokes in 1945, major operations did not begin there until 1960. Under a cooperative effort involving nearly 40institutions, thousands of bones were recovered between 1960 and 1965. The quarry is notable for the predominance of Allosaurus remains, the condition of the specimens, and the lack of scientific resolution on how it came to be. The majority of bones belong to the large theropod Allosaurus fragilis (it is estimated that the remains of at least 46A. fragilis have been found there, out of at minimum 73dinosaurs), and the fossils found there are disarticulated and well-mixed. Nearly a dozen scientific papers have been written on the taphonomy of the site, suggesting numerous mutually exclusive explanations for how it may have formed. Suggestions have ranged from animals getting stuck in a bog, to becoming trapped in deep mud, to falling victim to drought-induced mortality around a waterhole, to getting trapped in a spring-fed pond or seep. Regardless of the actual cause, the great quantity of well-preserved Allosaurus remains has allowed this genus to be known in detail, making it among the best-known theropods.

40|$|Studies of the {{shifting}} social organization and geography of global garment production {{have been critical}} {{to the development of}} the commodity chains framework as an important field of study for scholars of political economy in various disciplines. Our paper intervenes in this literature by proposing what we call a ‘disarticulations’ perspective, an approach attentive to historical and spatial processes of accumulation, disinvestment and dispossession that produce the uneven geographies generative of transnational production networks. We make the case for <b>disarticulations</b> as an approach to commodity chains via a case study of a region in north-central Mexico called La Laguna—a celebrated center of export dynamism in the 1990 s, following the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and of rapid decline in the 2000 s. Rather than offer a conventional commodity chain analysis of the boom to bust cycle in La Laguna, which would look to the dynamics of the contemporary apparel chain to explain the causes and consequences of La Laguna’s NAFTA-era trajectory, we instead follow La Laguna’s ‘travels’ through the cotton, textile, and garment industries over 150 years. We show how the recent NAFTA-era boom was premised on this layered history of engagements with the cotton – textile – apparel commodity chain. The <b>disarticulations</b> approach to commodity chains that we develop here foregrounds the processes of dispossession, accumulation and disinvestment through which not only commodity chains, but the uneven geographies that are their conditions of possibility, are reproduced. ...|$|R

KDs provide enhanced proprioception, a long lever arm, preservation of adductor muscle insertion, decreased metabolic cost of ambulation, and an end weight-bearing stump. The role for KDs {{in the setting of}} arterial insufficiency or overwhelming infection is less clear. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe technique modifications and report surgical outcomes following KDs at a high-volume Limb Salvage Center. MethodsA retrospective study of medical records for all patients who underwent a through-knee amputation performed by the senior author (C. E. A.) between 2004 and 2012 was completed. Medical records were reviewed to collect demographic, operative, and postoperative information for each of the patients identified. ResultsBetween 2004 and 2012, 46 through-knee amputations for 41 patients were performed. The mean patient age was 68 and indications for surgery included infection (56 %), arterial thrombosis (35 %), and trauma (9 %). Postoperative complications included superficial cellulitis (13 %), soft tissue infection (4 %), and flap ischemia (4 %) necessitating one case of surgical debridement (4 %) and four trans-femoral amputations (9 %). 9 (22 %) patients went on to ambulate. Postoperative ambulation was greatest in the traumatic cohort and for patients less than 50 years of age, P< 0. 05. Alternatively, diabetes mellitus and infection reduced the likelihood of postoperative ambulation, P< 0. 01. ConclusionsKnee <b>disarticulations</b> are a safe and effective alternative to other lower extremity amputations when clinically feasible. For patient unlikely to ambulate, a through-knee amputation maximizes ease of transfers, promotes mobility by providing a counterbalance, and eliminates the potential for knee flexion contracture with subsequent skin breakdown...|$|R
2500|$|Among {{the nasal}} bones of Europasaurus, several are known, but few are {{complete}} or undistorted. The nasals are overlapped posteriorly by the frontal bones, and towards the side, they articulate bluntly with the prefrontals. Unlike the nasals of Giraffatitan, those in Europasaurus project horizontally forwards, forming {{a small portion}} of the skull roof over the antorbital fenestrae. Four frontals are known from Europasaurus, three being from the left and one being from the right. Because of their <b>disarticulation,</b> it is likely that the frontals never fused during growth, unlike in Camarasaurus. The frontals form a portion of the skull roof, articulating with other bones such as the nasals, parietals, prefrontals and postorbitals, and they are longer antero-posteriorly than they are wide, a unique character among a eusauropodan. Like in diplodocoids (Amargasaurus, Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus), as well as Camarasaurus, the frontals are excluded from the frontoparietal fenestra (or parietal fenestra when frontals are excluded). The frontals are also excluded from the supratemporal fenestra margin (a widespread character in sauropods more derived than Shunosaurus), and they only have a small, unornamented participation in the orbit. Several parietal bones are known in Europasaurus, which show a rectangular shape much wider than long. the parietals are also wide when viewed from the back of the skull, being slightly taller than the foramen magnum (spinal cord opening). The parietals comtribute to about half the post-temporal fenestra (opening above the very back of the skull) border, with the other region enclosed by the squamosal bones and some braincase bones. Parietals also form part of the edge of the supratemporal fenestra, which is wider than long in Europasaurus, like in Giraffatitan, Camarasaurus and Spinophorosaurus. Besides the before mentioned fenestra, the parietals also have a [...] "postparietal fenestra", something rarely seen outside of Dicraeosauridae. A triradiate postorbital bone is present in Europasaurus, which evolved as the fusion of the postfrontal and postosbital bone of more basal taxa. Between the anterior and ventrally projecting processes the postorbital forms the margin of the orbit, and between the posterior and ventral processes it borders the infratemporal fenestra.|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores young women’s dis/identifications with feminism, and dis/articulations of feminism, within Aotearoa/NZ today. Grounded {{within a}} feminist poststructuralist approach, I carried out 14 semi-structured {{interviews}} with young women about their lives, feminism and postfeminism. The women were aged between 18 and 30 and came from diverse backgrounds {{in terms of}} ethnicity, sexuality and class. I then employed a discursive psychological analysis of the transcripts of the interviews. Although {{the majority of participants}} identified with feminism, feminist ideas, or explicitly as feminist on at least one occasion, for all participants these identifications were rarely straight forward. Participants drew on two key interpretive repertoires in their negotiation of feminism and the identity of feminist; firstly, an extreme-radical feminism interpretive repertoire, which was viewed negatively, and secondly, a liberal-equality feminism interpretive repertoire, which was viewed positively but simultaneously relegated feminism to history. Participants’ identifications with feminism were also mediated by their positioning on axes of privilege such as class and ethnicity, but not necessarily in straight forward ways. Furthermore, feminism was also regularly disarticulated by many of the participants through neoliberal discourses of individualism, through discourses constructing feminism as more relevant to “other”, generally Muslim, women in the world, and through a desire to distance themselves from constructions of feminism as anti-men. For the young women I interviewed, “feminism constitutes a contested and fraught territory” (Scharff, 2010, p. 831), crisscrossed with neoliberal, heteronormative and postfeminist discourses that mediate their dis/identifications with feminism and dis/articulations of feminism. Finally, I highlight how the two identified interpretive repertoires on feminism work in concert to maintain gendered power relations, before discussing some implications of the <b>disarticulations</b> of feminism that occurred in the present research, identifying how we might critically engage with the discourses prevalent in the <b>disarticulations...</b>|$|R
