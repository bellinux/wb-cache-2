5|$|Miles {{turns up}} in Summer Bay {{and decides to}} stick around after he thinks it is a {{familiar}} setting. He has nowhere to live and is starving. Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) becomes annoyed with him for stealing food out of the bins, but Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) takes pity on him and feeds him. He sees Sally {{on the beach and}} writes Milco in the sand. They later become friends and she feels like she has a close connection. He reveals his family's death to be the reason why he became a drifter. He eventually reveals the truth to Sally, that he is Milco and her twin brother. After it sinks in she is delighted with this and they become close. Miles stays with her and one night forgets to lock the door. Johnny Cooper (Callan Mulvey) enters the house and stabs Sally, however she survives but he blames himself. He decides to get his life back on track and becomes an English teacher at the school. Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance) initially gives him a hard time, but he is well liked after he and Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) arrange a leaving party for Sally, who has decided to move away. At the party Steven Matheson (Adam Willits) and Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson) are startled to meet the person they <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> whilst growing up.|$|E
25|$|For UK foster parents, {{the trauma}} of losing the {{children}} they had looked after and grown to love could be just as bad. Some children and families kept contact and many held fond memories and grateful thanks {{for the people of}} the north who showed so much kindness. The Mayor of Bolton had threatened the islands with another invasion after liberation, as so many Lancashire holidaymakers would want to see the islands they had <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E
500|$|On October 22, {{after the}} work of the Commission had ended, Khrushchev invited the delegates to a dinner which, {{according}} to Alia, was used [...] "to threaten those parties which might oppose the line of the Soviets in November." [...] He gave as an example an exchange between Soviet Politburo member Yekaterina Furtseva and Kapo, in which the former asked, [...] "Are you Hysni Kapo?! I've <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> you..." [...] Kapo replied, [...] "For good or bad?" [...] to which Furtseva stated, [...] "You have attacked the Soviet Union, but you are heading for trouble on that course," [...] getting [...] "the reply she deserved" [...] from Kapo, with Alia further writing that [...] "her mission was just to transmit the signal. Throughout the whole dinner she did not speak to us again." ...|$|E

[...] And in reply to Winterbourne's interrogation, [...] "There's Zurich," [...] she concluded, [...] "I think Zurich is lovely; and we hadn't <b>heard</b> half <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|R
500|$|Though the Ministry of Transport {{was adamant}} that the {{services}} {{should not be}} destinations in their own right, they did acquire {{a reputation for being}} a popular place for motorists to visit. During the 1960s, the services were a regular stopping venue for bands such as Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones. The Beatles stopped at Watford Gap while travelling from Liverpool to gigs in the south in the early stage of their career. Jimi Hendrix <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> [...] "Blue Boar", as the services were then popularly known, that {{he thought it was a}} London nightclub. Gerry Marsden, leader of the Pacemakers regularly visited the services when touring, saying it was good for [...] "a quick stop and a quick nosh." [...] The Floyd's Nick Mason recalls Hendrix stopping off at the services at 2am, while The Zombies' Chris White thought the services were [...] "the feeding trough of the beat boom". Harper claimed [...] "everybody would meet at Watford Gap because it was the one place after a show where you were guaranteed a bit of a sit-down at 2am".|$|E
2500|$|In the show's second series, Ullman portrays current Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as {{megalomaniac}} who {{is after}} more than just Scottish Independence. Westminster's youngest MP, Mhairi Black assists Sturgeon in the series opener by torturing a captive JK Rowling. On Sturgeon, Ullman says: [...] "I like her a lot and respect her steeliness. [...] I would love her to meet [...] and play golf with him and whup his ass. [...] Jeremy Dyson imagined her as a Bond villain — we filmed for two days in Chislehurst Caves, it was freezing and I was wearing pink, four-inch high heels. But I felt very powerful, and the crew were very much under my command. I think she will like it — {{she seems to have}} a good sense of humour." [...] The portrayal was lauded by viewers and critics alike as well as angering some SNP supporters. Singer Toyah Willcox implored Sturgeon to take the sketch in the right spirit. Ullman had impersonated Willcox back in the early 1980s. Sturgeon took to Twitter to comment on the impersonation: [...] "Great to see my fav Scottish designers @TottyRocksLtd featuring on @TraceyUllmanTV last night)" [...] Upon seeing her portrayal, Mhairi Black (impersonated by actress Olivia Morgan) was quoted as saying [...] "It was all right. It was quite a bizarre scenario. But I thought it was quite clever and quite witty." [...] In an interview for the Metro newspaper during the 2017 United Kingdom general election, Nicola Sturgeon was asked about Ullman's impersonation of her. [...] "I've not seen all of them but I had to watch some because I've <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it. I thought it was really funny." [...] When asked if she should her in all the [...] "Brexit drama", Sturgeon responded: [...] "I definitely think she should! She's got the outfit and everything!" ...|$|E

500|$|When Debs was {{released}} from the Atlanta Penitentiary, the other prisoners sent him off with [...] "a roar of cheers" [...] and a crowd of 50,000 greeted his return to Terre Haute to the accompaniment of band music. En route home, Debs was warmly received at the White House by Harding, who greeted him by saying: [...] "Well, I've <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> damned <b>much</b> <b>about</b> you, Mr. Debs, that I am now glad to meet you personally." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is {{an awfully}} fine fellow," [...] said Mr. Hill heartily, [...] "and I'm {{delighted to have}} met the 'little sister' he used to talk <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about.</b> I {{want you to come}} ever and meet my mother and sister. They have <b>heard</b> me talk <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> Max that they think almost as much of him as I do, and they will be glad to meet his sister." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, {{if it had}} {{but come}} a little sooner!' moaned John within him. He replied {{as soon as he}} could regain self-command, 'I am glad Bob is in the navy at last--he is <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more fitted for that than the merchant-service--so brave by nature, ready for any daring deed.

6000|$|... "And {{there is}} the device," [...] he said, [...] "we have <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> of late--a five-petalled flower drawn in red ink ... the Scarlet Pimpernel, I presume." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{road into}} the camp ran through a {{considerable}} plain, which {{was covered by}} bodies of cavalry and infantry engaged upon their drill. We had <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in England <b>about</b> Napoleon's troops, and their feats had appeared so extraordinary, that my imagination had prepared me for men of very striking appearance. As a matter of fact, the ordinary infantry of the line, in their blue coats and white breeches and gaiters, were quite little fellows, and even their high brass-covered hats and red plumes could not make them very imposing.|$|R
6000|$|Although {{deprived}} for {{the present}} of all intercourse with Chastel and Yoletta, now in constant attendance on her mother, I {{ought to have been}} happy, for all things seemed conspiring to make my life precious to me. Nevertheless, I was far from happy; and, having <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> said <b>about</b> reason in my late conversations with the father and mother of the house, I began to pay an unusual amount of attention to this faculty in me, in order to discover by its aid the secret of the sadness which continued at all times during this period to oppress my heart. I only discovered, what others have discovered before me, that the practice of introspection has a corrosive effect on the mind, which only serves to aggravate the malady it is intended to cure. During those restful days in the Mother's Room, when I had sat with Chastel, this spirit of melancholy had been with me; but the mother's hallowing presence had given something of a divine color to it, my passions had slumbered, and, except at rare intervals, I had thought of sorrow as of something at an immeasurable distance from me. Then to my spirit ...|$|R
60|$|It is now {{several years}} since I first met Caleb Bawcombe, a {{shepherd}} of the South Wiltshire Downs, but already old and infirm and past work. I {{met him at}} a distance from his native village, and it was only after I had known him a long time and had spent many afternoons and evenings in his company, listening to his anecdotes of his shepherding days, that I went to see his own old home for myself--the village of Winterbourne Bishop already described, to find it a place after my own heart. But as I have said, if I had never known Caleb and <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> from him <b>about</b> his own life and the lives of many of his fellow-villagers, I should probably never have seen this village.|$|R

6000|$|... "And we've <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> you!" [...] cried Belle. [...] "Oh, wasn't {{it simply}} {{wonderful}} how you found your folks! Why, it's {{almost like a}} page out of a fairy book!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Samuel Davies was a Presbyterian {{minister}} {{who later became}} the fourth president of Princeton University. He was noted for preaching to African slaves who converted to Christianity in unusually large numbers, and is credited with the first sustained proselytization of slaves in Virginia. Davies wrote a letter in 1757 in which he refers to the religious zeal of an enslaved man whom he had encountered during his journey. [...] "I am a poor slave, brought into a strange country, where I never expect to enjoy my liberty. While I lived in my own country, I knew nothing of that Jesus I have <b>heard</b> you speak <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about.</b> I lived quite careless {{what will become of}} me when I die; but I now see such a life will never do, and I come to you, Sir, that you may tell me some good things, concerning Jesus Christ, and my Duty to GOD, for I am resolved not to live any more as I have done." ...|$|R
60|$|Nero's Baths, {{the ruins}} of Baiae, the Temple of Serapis; Cumae, where the Cumaen Sybil {{interpreted}} the oracles, the Lake Agnano, with its ancient submerged city still visible far down in its depths--these and a hundred other points of interest we examined with critical imbecility, but the Grotto of the Dog claimed our chief attention, because we had <b>heard</b> and read <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it. Every body has written about the Grotto del Cane and its poisonous vapors, from Pliny down to Smith, and every tourist has held a dog over its floor by the legs to test {{the capabilities of the}} place. The dog dies in a minute and a half--a chicken instantly. As a general thing, strangers who crawl in there to sleep do not get up until they are called. And then they don't either. The stranger that ventures to sleep there takes a permanent contract. I longed to see this grotto. I resolved to take a dog and hold him myself; suffocate him a little, and time him; suffocate him some more and then finish him. We reached the grotto at about three in the afternoon, and proceeded at once to make the experiments. But now, an important difficulty presented itself. We had no dog.|$|R
6000|$|But the Colonel disconcerted the petitioners {{by announcing}} that he had {{business}} at Belforest, and would drive Johnny over in the dog- cart. So Jessie had to console herself by agreeing with her mother that Johnny looked much more manly, yes, and had an air and style about him which both admired very much, though, while Mrs. Brownlow deemed it the true outcome of the admixture of Friar and Brownlow, Jessie gave more credit to Eton and Belforest, for Jessie was really fond of her aunt, to whom she had owed most of her extra gaieties. Moreover, Mrs. Brownlow, though often chafing secretly, had the power of reticence, and would not set the minds of her children against one who was always doing them kindnesses. True, these favours were more than she could easily brook, since her pride and independence were not, like her husband's, tempered by warm affection. It was his doing that the expenses of Johnny's education had been accepted, and that Esther and Ellen had been sent by their aunt to a good school; thus gratitude, unpalatable though it were, prevented unguarded censure. She abstained from much; and as there was no quick intuition in the family, even Jessie, the most in her confidence, only vaguely knew that mamma thought Aunt Caroline too clever and fly-away; but mamma was grave and wise, {{and it was very}} nice to have an aunt who was young and lively, and always had pleasant things going on in her house. Jessie always had her full share, not indeed appreciating the intellect, but possessing beauty and charm enough to be always appreciated there. [...] "Sweetly pretty," [...] as Mrs. Coffinkey called her, was exactly what she was, for she was thoroughly good and unselfish, and a happy, simple nature looked out through her brown smiling eyes. She was very fond of her cousins, had shared all the anxieties of the last fortnight to the utmost, and was a good deal disappointed at being baulked of the walk with her brother, in which she would have <b>heard</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more <b>about</b> Armine, Jock, and Aunt Caroline, than would be communicated in public.|$|R
