5|$|Early {{experiments}} with radiolabelled systemin in tomato demonstrated {{that it is}} transported through the phloem sap in tomato plants and was therefore {{thought to be the}} systemic signal that activated systemic acquired resistance. This view was challenged by grafting experiments which showed that mutants <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> jasmonic acid biosynthesis and perception were unable to activate systemic acquired resistance. It is now thought that jasmonic acid is the systemic signal and that systemin upregulates the pathways for jasmonic acid synthesis.|$|E

5|$|Genetics {{play a role}} in the {{development}} of COPD. It is more common among relatives of those with COPD who smoke than unrelated smokers. Currently, the only clearly inherited risk factor is alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AAT). This risk is particularly high if someone <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> alpha 1-antitrypsin also smokes. It is responsible for about 1–5% of cases and the condition is present in about 3–4 in 10,000 people. Other genetic factors are being investigated, of which there are likely to be many.|$|E
5|$|After {{five years}} of war and heavy {{attrition}} many of the Luftwaffe's pilots were inexperienced fledgelings and poorly trained, <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> marksmanship and flight skills. There was a shortage of experienced instructors, {{and many of the}} training units were forced to fly front-line operations in order to bolster the front-line Jagdgeschwader. Long-range Allied fighters exacerbated this situation by shooting down many training aircraft. By late 1944 there were no safe areas in which pilots could be trained without the possibility of air attack. Allied personnel who witnessed the attacks frequently remarked on the poor aim of the strafing aircraft, and many of the Luftwaffe aircraft shot down by Allied anti-aircraft fire were caught because they were flying too slowly and too high. Aviation fuel supplies were also at a premium.|$|E
5|$|Apoptosis is a {{controlled}} {{process in which}} the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.|$|E

60|$|The {{physical}} {{education of children}} is thus, in various ways, seriously faulty. It errs <b>in</b> <b>deficient</b> feeding; <b>in</b> <b>deficient</b> clothing; <b>in</b> <b>deficient</b> exercise (among girls at least); and in excessive mental application. Considering the regime as a whole, its tendency is too exacting: it asks too much and gives too little. In {{the extent to which}} it taxes the vital energies, it makes the juvenile life far more like the adult life than it should be. It overlooks the truth that, as in the foetus the entire vitality is expended in growth--as in the infant, the expenditure of vitality in growth is so great as to leave extremely little for either physical or mental action; so throughout childhood and youth, growth is the dominant requirement to which all others must be subordinated: a requirement which dictates the giving of much and the taking away of little--a requirement which, therefore, restricts the exertion of body and mind in proportion to the rapidity of growth--a requirement which permits the mental and physical activities to increase only as fast as the rate of growth diminishes.|$|R
5|$|By {{the late}} 4th century, the Empire had become chronically <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> raising {{sufficient}} troops from amongst its own population. As an alternative, taxation raised internally was increasingly used to subsidise {{growing numbers of}} barbarian recruits. The Romans had, for some time, recruited individual non-Roman soldiers into regular military units. In 358AD, this practice was accelerated by the wholescale adoption of the entire Salian Franks people into the Empire, providing a ready pool of such recruits. In return for being allowed to settle as foederatii in northern Gallia on the near side of the Rhine, the Franks were expected to defend the Empire's borders in their territory and provide troops to serve in Roman units.|$|E
5|$|Fruit is rich {{in sugar}} but <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> other nutrients, {{so it must be}} eaten in large quantities. Bohemian {{waxwings}} have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy. They can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans, but may still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Waxwings often drink water or eat snow in winter, since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect. In the summer, the fruits are juicier and water is less of a problem.|$|E
5|$|Humans must consume {{vitamins}} periodically {{but with}} differing schedules, to avoid deficiency. The body's stores for different vitamins vary widely; vitamins A, D, and B12 {{are stored in}} significant amounts, mainly in the liver, and an adult's diet may be <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> vitamins A and D for many months and B12 in some cases for years, before developing a deficiency condition. However, vitamin B3 (niacin and niacinamide) is not stored in significant amounts, so stores may last {{only a couple of}} weeks. For vitamin C, the first symptoms of scurvy in experimental studies of complete vitamin C deprivation in humans have varied widely, from a month to more than six months, depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores.|$|E

5|$|Nearly {{two billion}} {{people in the}} {{developing}} world are <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> zinc. In children, it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea and contributes to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year. The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea. Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality, especially among children with low birth weight or stunted growth. However, zinc supplements should not be administered alone, because many {{in the developing world}} have several deficiencies, and zinc interacts with other micronutrients.|$|E
5|$|The HV {{continued}} to grow, numbering about 200,000 troops {{by the end}} of 1991. Although the force successfully countered the JNA that year, the HV was <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> organisation, training and heavy-weapons support. By the end of 1991, the HV still lacked sufficient resources to push back the JNA and continued experiencing inadequate work by their staff. Nonetheless, like the ZNG it benefited from its troops' high morale and the well-defined purpose of its mission. The growth and systematic improvement of HV capability accelerated in 1992, continuing throughout the Croatian War of Independence. The anniversary of the ZNG parade at the Kranjčevićeva Street Stadium is celebrated annually in Croatia as Armed Forces Day and Croatian Army Day.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{condition of}} the country had deteriorated so drastically that recovery to pre-conflict levels was not achieved until 1925. The most acute crisis was in the food supply, already <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> 1917, though starvation had been avoided in southern Finland. According to the Red and White militants, the Civil War would solve all past problems, but instead the power struggle led to starvation in southern Finland too. Late in 1918, Finnish politician Rudolf Holsti appealed for relief to Herbert Hoover, the American chairman of the Committee for Relief in Belgium: Hoover arranged for food shipments and persuaded the Allies to relax their blockade of the Baltic Sea, which had obstructed food supplies to Finland, to allow the food in.|$|E

5|$|The {{electric}} shock delivered by a {{marbled electric ray}} can be severe but is not directly life-threatening. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, when live rays were used to treat conditions such as chronic headaches. This and other electric ray species are used as model organisms in biomedical research. Various coastal demersal fisheries take the marbled electric ray as bycatch; captured rays are usually discarded as they have little commercial value. The impact of fishing on its population is uncertain, and thus International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this ray under Data <b>Deficient.</b> <b>In</b> the Mediterranean Sea, it remains the most common electric ray and in some areas may be increasing in number.|$|E
5|$|To prepare {{these forces}} the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German High Command) {{increased}} the call-up age range and recruited from Eastern European countries controlled by German forces, increasing manpower on the Western Front from roughly 400,000 {{to just over}} 1 million soldiers. Hastily organized into new divisions, these infantrymen lacked training and sometimes even weapons. Despite an immense German effort {{in the face of}} intense Allied bombing to build the necessary stocks for the offensive, there were shortages of fuel, ammunition, weapons and manpower by the scheduled date of the counterattack. Even the elite Waffen-SS divisions were often <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> manpower.|$|E
5|$|A three-month quiet period descended {{upon the}} Eastern Front as the Soviets {{prepared}} their defences and the Germans attempted {{to build up}} their forces. The Germans used this period for specialised training of their assault troops. All units underwent training and combat rehearsals. The Waffen-SS had built a full-scale duplicate Soviet strong point {{that was used to}} practice the techniques for neutralizing such positions. The panzer divisions received replacement men and equipment and attempted to get back up to strength. The German forces {{to be used in the}} offensive included 12 panzer divisions and 5 panzergrenadier divisions, four of which had tank strengths greater than their neighboring panzer divisions. However, the force was markedly <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> infantry divisions, which were essential to hold ground and to secure the flanks. By the time the Germans initiated the offensive, their force amounted to around 777,000 men, 2,451 tanks and assault guns (70 percent of the German armour on the Eastern Front) and 7,417 guns and mortars.|$|E

5|$|The {{pituitary}} {{develops in}} {{the third week of}} embryogenesis from interactions between the diencephalon part of the brain and the nasal cavity. The brain cells secrete FGF-8, Wnt5a and BMP-4, and the oral cavity BMP-2. Together, these cellular signals stimulate a group of cells from the oral cavity to form Rathke's pouch, which becomes independent of the nasal cavity and develops into the anterior pituitary; this process includes the suppression of production of a protein called Sonic hedgehog by the cells of Rathke's pouch. The cells then differentiate further into the various hormone-producing cells of the pituitary. This requires particular transcription factors that induce the expression of particular genes. Some of these transcription factors {{have been found to be}} <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> some forms of rare combined pituitary hormone deficiencies (CPHD) in childhood. These are HESX1, PROP1, POU1F1, LHX3, LHX4, TBX19, SOX2 and SOX3. Each transcription factor acts in particular groups of cells. Therefore, various genetic mutations are associated with specific hormone deficiencies. For instance, POU1F1 (also known as Pit-1) mutations cause specific deficiencies in growth hormone, prolactin and TSH. In addition to the pituitary, some of the transcription factors are also required for the development of other organs; some of these mutations are therefore also associated with specific birth defects.|$|E
5|$|The total {{population}} {{size of the}} African river martin is unknown. In the late 1980s, {{it appeared to be}} common, if local, and large numbers were seen on migration in Gabon. However, it is particularly poorly known in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and it is unclear if there is any relationship between the birds breeding in the DRC and those breeding in coastal areas of Gabon and the Republic of Congo. A flock of 15,000 birds was seen in 1997, and a mixed flock with rosy bee-eater Merops malimbicus was estimated at 100,000 birds; nevertheless, {{due to the lack of}} detailed information, the species is classed by the IUCN as Data <b>Deficient.</b> <b>In</b> the 1950s, the species was caught and eaten in large quantities in the DRC by the local population, and this practice could be increasing. Breeding colonies in river sandbars are also liable to flooding, but thousands of birds were breeding on the grasslands east of Gamba as recently as 2005.|$|E
5|$|With {{the worst}} of the aircraft's {{problems}} believed to have been resolved, the XR-1 was submitted for service testing by the Army Air Forces in 1943. During the course of the Army's evaluations, the XR-1's empennage failed during structural testing, the surfaces being strengthened as a result and testing, following the repairs, resuming in 1944. Despite the modifications to the design, however, the XR-1 still proved to be <b>deficient</b> <b>in</b> control authority. In July 1943, the XR-1 program suffered a setback when the aircraft crashed, seriously injuring test pilot Jim Ray, who had replaced Leavitt following the latter's dismissal from the company. The crash was caused by an inspector's error in leaving a suspect part on the aircraft, the rotor hub failing in flight {{as a result of the}} decision. The aircraft was repairable, but it would be a year before the XR-1 was ready to fly again.|$|E

40|$|Background: The risk of venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) {{in women}} taking combined oral contraceptives (COCs) {{is attributed to}} changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis. Their impact may be greater in women with preexistent thrombophilic defects. Methods: We assessed the effects of COCs on absolute VTE risk in women with single or multiple thrombophilic defects in a retrospective family cohort study. Female relatives of probands with VTE and hereditary deficiencies of protein S, protein C, or antithrombin were tested for known thrombophilic defects, including the index deficiency. Absolute incidences of VTE were compared <b>in</b> <b>deficient</b> vs nondeficient women, <b>in</b> <b>deficient</b> and nondeficient women who ever or never used COCs, and <b>in</b> <b>deficient</b> and nondeficient women with 0, 1, or more than 1 other thrombophilic defect during exposure to COCs. Results: Of 222 women, 135 (61 %) ever used COCs. Overall, annual incidences of VTE were 1. 64 % and 0. 18 % <b>in</b> <b>deficient</b> and nondeficient women, respectively; the adjusted relative risk was 11. 9 (95 % confidence interval, 3. 9 - 36. 2). The risk was comparable <b>in</b> <b>deficient</b> ever and never users (1. 73 % vs 1. 54 %). Annual incidences during actual COC use were 4. 62 % <b>in</b> <b>deficient</b> women and 0. 48 % in nondeficient women; the relative risk was 9. 7 (95 % confidence interval, 3. 0 - 42. 4). The incidence increased by concomitant thrombophilic defects, from 3. 49 % to 12. 00 % <b>in</b> <b>deficient</b> women and from 0 % to 3. 13 % in nondeficient women. Conclusions: Women with hereditary deficiencies of protein S, protein C, or antithrombin {{are at high risk}} of VTE during use of COCs, particularly when other thrombophilic defects are present. They have VTE at a younger age, but the overall risk is not increased by COCs...|$|R
