5000|$|The Scotsman {{obituary}} of Muriel Spark, {{referring to}} her autobiography Curriculum Vitae, stated:The title was precise. A CV is an <b>impersonal</b> <b>account</b> of one's career suggesting progress from strength to strength. It now seems clear that she did love with passion one of the boyfriends mentioned: the poet, Howard Sergeant. Without passion but with great loyalty, she also loved the man whose misinformation had prompted Spark's desire {{to set the record}} straight: Derek Stanford. She had hoped, in turn, to marry both men, and both had deserted her.- The Scotsman ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{narration}} {{allows the}} reader to follow Fouad and experience the petrifying presence of religion-based power and oppression in its domination of daily life. Fouad's upbringing lacked the presence of women, the result of strict Islamic law in which women have little freedom and are hidden from society. Repression {{is not unique to}} women; there is general suppression of the human body and its understanding. As a result, Fouad lives in a masculine, chauvinist environment, and experiences numerous acts of oppression instituted by the political system including the public stoning of women, female genital mutilation (which he sees in a dream), and terrifying scenes taking place in court and in prison. However, the narration maintains a cool, almost humorous perspective as these thoughts and memories flow through Fouadâ€™s head, making the novel more of an <b>impersonal</b> <b>account</b> than tragic.|$|E
25|$|Bookkeeping by double entry {{may have}} been known to Stevin, as he was a clerk in Antwerp in his younger years, either {{practically}} or through the medium of the works of Italian authors such as Luca Pacioli and Gerolamo Cardano. However, Stevin was the first to recommend the use of <b>impersonal</b> <b>accounts</b> in the national household. He brought it into practice for Prince Maurice, and recommended it to the French statesman Sully.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} is to reconceptualise the English School of International Relations {{according}} to what I describe as the history/theory dialectic. The origins of this dialectic are sought in the thought of E. H. Carr, Herbert Butterfield, and Martin Wight, who {{drew attention to the}} interpenetration of history and theory. In their capacity as historians, the writers examined in my thesis struggled with problems normally associated with theoretical work in International Relations and elsewhere and tried to combine personal and <b>impersonal</b> <b>accounts</b> of history. They also emphasised the role of the historian which is no {{different from that of the}} theorist in attributing meaning to a series of apparently unrelated events. As international theorists, Butterfield, Wight and Carr underlined the historicity of international theory, and offered a historicist conceptualisation of international change that assigned priority to European interests and values. Their belief in the co-constitution of history and theory, has important consequences for contemporary English School debates concerning the proper definition of the relationship between order and justice, international society and world society, pluralism and solidarism. What lies at the end of the history/theory dialectic is not an unproblematic combination of opposites but the recognition of the need to be cautious towards the categories we use in order to capture and analyse a multidimensional reality which is subject to change...|$|R
40|$|Sociologists and, more recently, {{critical}} medical {{anthropologists have}} been arguing for a refocusing {{of the analysis}} of health and health care towards a perspective which considers the broader global political economy. In {{the context of the}} debt crisis and IMF/World Bank-inspired structural adjustment policies, the political economy theoretical perspective is becoming even more relevant in the analysis of health underdevelopment in many 'Third World' countries. This study focuses on the direct and indirect effects of the Jamaican debt crisis and structural adjustment programmes on health care services and health standards. In this paper it is argued that there are methodological problems using quantitative data when studying the effects of structural adjustment. In addition to providing a limited account of the effects, it is argued that the basic problem is a matter of the availability and reliability of the quantitative data in many 'Third World' countries. It is argued that some of these problems could be overcome by the application of qualitative micro-level analysis. This type of methodology is important to ascertain the effects of global processes at the grass roots level and to gain insights into what those working in the health sector are experiencing and what they perceive as the effects, if any, of structural adjustment policies. This has often been missing from the <b>impersonal</b> <b>accounts</b> offered by quantitative research on the subject to date. Jamaica health underdevelopment structural adjustment quantitative qualitative methods...|$|R
40|$|As {{the title}} of this study suggests, the {{following}} pages are concerned with ballads which refer to death by hanging or burning. This subject brings an aesthetic world into the realms of the real and presents an artistic conceptualisation of both the 'real' - historic facts - and the 'abstract' - human emotions. In terms of the 'real', ballads which refer to actual events can be compared to historic documentation in order to ascertain the extent of interaction between the ballad world and historic fact. In terms of the 'abstract', execution and death are emotive subjects, so how emotional potential is controlled within the tradition is important, for even those reports which claim to be <b>impersonal</b> <b>accounts</b> of executions can be disturbing, even though centuries may separate a reader from the event. Formalising the language is one method of control and this study will discuss formulas and structures related to execution scenes. The formulas also provide points of connection between ballads which otherwise would seem to be unrelated, such as Mary Hamilton and Hobie Noble. The ballads discussed come from different repertoires, regions and centuries. Thus, those scenes which have been retained are more than a personal or regional variant of that scene; it has become a cultural interpretation and it may prove rewarding to consider what precedents exist for such interpretations and whether these are historic, national - specifically Scottish - or part of a wider aesthetic interpretation of death and justice. The printed ballad trade which existed in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Scotland has also been referred to, in order to provide alternative interpretations of the spectacle of execution and the popular presentation of the condemned. It may be that one tradition relies more closely on reality than the other, or it may be that two conflicting fictions exist...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Many {{individuals}} dislike making {{statements that}} are not true, so non-binding promises may gain power to foster trust & cooperation. If truth-value of a statement is what lying aversion is all about, then these effects should kick in even with bare and <b>impersonal</b> promises. Theoretical <b>accounts</b> of cost-of-lying (implicitly) presume this. We test the idea in a trust game, and report data that provide only limited support for a truth-value based cost-of-lying. We also test for guilt aversion and again find only limited support...|$|R
