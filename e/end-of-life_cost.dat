40|$|International audienceThe {{lithium-ion}} battery technology as the today’s {{best available technology}} is a key in accompanying vehicles electrification. Its end-of-life recovery is lever in overcoming technical challenges towards electromobility deployment, such as battery cost, environmental impact, the availability of constituent materials and the mandatory recycling rate. In this chapter, we focus on economic aspects, {{in order to assess}} the end-of-life recovery impact: we analyze the <b>end-of-life</b> <b>cost</b> evolution of lithium-ion batteries to determine whether it will be a source of cost or profit for car manufacturers. We define and analyze two recovery options: on the one hand, simply recycling which is mandatory by regulation and, on the other hand, repurposing for reuse in many second life applications (from residence related applications to energy storage and grid stabilization). To account for the complexity and the long-term horizon of our study (2030), we combine the use of System Dynamics with the Stanford Research Institute Matrix for building scenarios that mix relevant factors such as the electric vehicle market and the proportion of repurposing for reuse. Finally we show that repurposing could lower the battery’s initial cost—under certain conditions regarding the future battery price and the repurposing cost—where recycling might increase it...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the effects of likely {{demographic}} changes on medical spending for the elderly. Standard forecasts highlight the potential for greater life expectancy to increase costs: medical costs generally increase with age, and greater life expectancy means that more of the elderly will be in the older age groups. Two factors work in the other direction, however. First, increases in life expectancy mean that a smaller share of the elderly will be {{in the last year of}} life, when medical costs generally are very high. Furthermore, more of the elderly will be dying at older ages, and <b>end-of-life</b> <b>costs</b> typically decline with age at death. Second, disability rates among the surviving population have been declining in recent years by 0. 5 to 1. 5 percent annually. Reductions in disability, if sustained, will also reduce medical spending. Thus, changes in disability and mortality should, on net, reduce average medical spending on the elderly. However, these effects are not as large as the projected increase in medical spending stemming from increases in overall medical costs. Technological change in medicine at anywhere near its historic rate would still result in a substantial public sector burden for medical costs. ...|$|R

If producers were made responsible for end-of-life management (i. e., reuse, recycling, energy recovery, treatment, and/or final disposal) of products, they would find it in their self-interest to anticipate <b>end-of-life</b> <b>costs</b> and obligations and design their products to minimize those costs. Prices of new products would reflect those end-of-life obligations, and producers that were successful in competing in this manner would be able to sell their products more cheaply than those that did not engage in design for environment (DfE). In this respect, EPR would also provide incentives to consumers, because product prices could reflect the producers’ relative success in meeting these goals. This vision also included other aspirations. One was that the resulting policy schemes would be dynamic—that is, as the product mix, produc-tion and processing technologies, or market and societal conditions changed, so too would the responses by the producers facing EPR require-ments.

5000|$|The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive), as it {{is often}} {{referred}} to, has now been transposed in national laws in all member countries of the European Union. It was designed to make equipment manufacturers financially or physically responsible for their equipment {{at the end of}} its life, under a policy known as Extended producer responsibility (EPR). [...] "Users of electrical and electronic equipment from private households should have the possibility of returning WEEE at least free of charge", and manufacturers must dispose of it in an environmentally friendly manner, by ecological disposal, reuse, or refurbishment. EPR is seen as a useful policy as it internalizes the <b>end-of-life</b> <b>costs</b> and provided a competitive incentive for companies to design equipment with fewer costs and liabilities when it reached its end of life. However, the application of the WEEE Directive has been criticized for implementing the EPR concept in a collective manner, and thereby losing the competitive incentive of individual manufacturers to be rewarded for their green design.32 Since August 13, 2005, electronics manufacturers have become financially responsible for compliance to the WEEE Directive. Under the directive, each country recycles at least 4 kg of electronic waste per capita per year. Furthermore, the Directive should [...] "decrease e-waste and e-waste exports.". In December 2008 a draft revision to the Directive proposed a market-based goal of 65%, which is 22 kg per capita in the case of the United Kingdom. A decision on the proposed revisions could result in a new WEEE Directive by 2012.|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurposeIn this analysis, we {{compared}} costs and explored the cost-effectiveness of subsequent-line treatment with cetuximab or panitumumab {{in patients with}} wild-type KRAS (exon 2) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) after previous chemotherapy treatment failure. Data were used from ASPECCT (A Study of Panitumumab Efficacy and Safety Compared to Cetuximab in Patients With KRAS Wild-Type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer), a Phase III, head-to-head randomized noninferiority study comparing the efficacy and safety of panitumumab and cetuximab in this population. MethodsA decision-analytic model was developed to perform a cost-minimization analysis and a semi-Markov model was created to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of panitumumab monotherapy versus cetuximab monotherapy in chemotherapy-resistant wild-type KRAS (exon 2) mCRC. The cost-minimization model assumed equivalent efficacy (progression-free survival) {{based on data from}} ASPECCT. The cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted with the full information (uncertainty) from ASPECCT. Both analyses were conducted from a US third-party payer perspective and calculated average anti–epidermal growth factor receptor doses from ASPECCT. Costs associated with drug acquisition, treatment administration (every 2 weeks for panitumumab, weekly for cetuximab), and incidence of infusion reactions were estimated in both models. The cost-effectiveness model also included physician visits, disease progression monitoring, best supportive care, and <b>end-of-life</b> <b>costs</b> and utility weights estimated from EuroQol 5 -Dimension questionnaire responses from ASPECCT. FindingsThe cost-minimization model results demonstrated lower projected costs for patients who received panitumumab versus cetuximab, with a projected cost savings of $ 9468 (16. 5 %) per panitumumab-treated patient. In the cost-effectiveness model, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained revealed panitumumab to be less costly, with marginally better outcomes than cetuximab. ImplicationsThese economic analyses comparing panitumumab and cetuximab in chemorefractory wild-type KRAS (exon 2) mCRC suggest benefits in favor of panitumumab.

40|$|Current {{structural}} design practice is {{primarily concerned with}} optimizing the construction cost and schedule of a building project, while ensuring that the structure meets basic safety and serviceability requirements. The maintenance costs, alteration/replacement <b>costs,</b> and <b>end-of-life</b> <b>costs</b> associated {{with the support of}} the structure after the initial construction process is given far less consideration. Initial research indicates that, for a typical building, the majority of the cost over the system life cycle is incurred after the original structure has been completed. The ultimate value and longevity of a building is, therefore, largely dependant on the ability of the structure to be economically maintained and easily modified during its service life. The objective of this paper is to outline a design process that considers how buildings interact with time. The process involves two fundamental steps: (1) the modularization of the structure to accommodate how different parts of the building change over time and (2) the design of modular components in consideration of their expected service life. Life cycle cost methods are applied to evaluate the performance of design alternatives-thus making it easier to explicitly consider the cost associated with how a structure will be supported and may be adapted over time, in addition to the customary tasks of calculating construction costs and schedules. Despite the apparent benefits to this approach, there are a number of obstacles preventing the adoption of life cycle design principles into professional practice. Specific obstacles to implementation are discussed with respect to the construction industries in both the United States and Japan. The paper concludes with the description of further case study research to be conducted in the Japan during the summer of 2003, the findings of which will be published as an addendum to this document. by Forest Lee Flager.

40|$|International audienceThe {{imminent}} {{introduction of}} the European Directive relating to the recovery and recycling of two million end-of-life vehicles per annum has resulted in significant developments and changes within the UK vehicle recovery chain. The economic ramifications of this conformance have left many end-of-life stakeholders in a uniquely different market, based on contract negotiations, investment, and very challenging targets. The archaic and reactive nature of the recovery industry has meant that the demands {{of being part of}} the extended enterprise have never been present, and as such waste reduction and value improvement have never been major industry concerns.

MethodsPhase 1 tracked for a year, from March 2009, health services received by 133 OPWD in six residential CHs in the East of England. CH and resident characteristics were obtained through standardised assessment tools, interviews with CH managers and publicly available information from the independent regulator of social care services in England. Phase 2 used a modified Appreciative Inquiry intervention that ran for 6 months from January 2011, in three of the six CHs. Wilcoxon matched-pairs sign-rank tests were conducted to compare total cost and cost components during Phases 1 and 2 for those residents who had participated in both. ResultsCosts for each resident in Phase 1 were about £ 2800 per month, including service, accommodation and medication. Resource use was associated with resident characteristics. The intervention was perceived as having a positive impact on working relationships between CHs and visiting health care practitioners. Following the intervention total service costs fell by 43 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{estimate}} the total healthcare costs and costs attributable to prostate cancer across {{all stages of}} disease, and to determine the predictors of those costs, as describing the cost of care for patients with prostate cancer is useful to understand the economic burden of illness, explore patterns of care, and provide reliable cost data for economic evaluations. METHODS We estimated direct medical costs for 42 484 men diagnosed with prostate cancer in Ontario, Canada between 1995 and 2002 using linked administrative data. The observation time was divided into five phases: (I) before diagnosis (6 months before); (II) initial care (12 months after diagnosis); (III) continuing care; (IV) pre-terminal care (from 18 to 6 months before death); and (V) terminal care (6 months before death). Attributable costs were estimated by comparing costs in cases to matched controls. RESULTS The total direct costs per 100 days (in $Canadian, 2004) were: Phase I $ 1297; II $ 3289; III $ 1495; IV $ 5629; and V $ 16 020. Prostate cancer-attributable costs accounted for 72 % of total costs in the 12 -month period after diagnosis (II, $ 2366), but < 35 % of total costs in phases III to V ($ 398, $ 1977 and $ 3140, respectively). An advanced stage at diagnosis, being older at diagnosis, and higher comorbidity were associated with increased costs. CONCLUSION Prostate cancer is associated with increased direct healthcare costs over {{the natural history of}} the disease. Costs are highest around two events, cancer diagnosis and cancer death.

The analysis of more than 75 different consumer electronic products clearly shows groups in state-of-the-art recycling performance in both environmental and economic terms and a substantial distinction between the various product categories. From there, the evaluation takes place of technical improvements in relation to current best-practice recycling. Even more, with the QWERTY/EE concept it is made possible to select and rank improvement options of current and future end-of-life processing and to determine which options bring substantial environmental gain in relation to financial investments made. For glass dominated products, an increase in glass recycling results in significant environmental improvements. The same counts for separate sorting and treatment of precious metal dominated products with a relatively high precious metal content like cellular phones. However, economies of scale are a major assumption that has to be fulfilled in this case. Other conclusions and outcomes are that plastic recycling seems only eco-efficient for large housings of appliances already undergoing disassembly due to the presence of a cathode ray tube (CRT) or liquid crystal display (LCD). For small and medium-sized housings, the extra costs of plastic recycling are high in relation to the environmental improvement realized. In most cases, dedicated shredding and separation of metal dominated products does not lead to substantial environmental or economic improvements. In general, it is shown that the various options to increase the eco-efficiency of end-of-life systems lead to very mixed environmental and economic results. As a consequence, end-of-life policy strategies should be evaluated, and in some cases revised, to support and enhance the most eco-efficient improvement options. Regarding the sensitivity of the results, it is shown that although the different environmental assessment models prioritize individual materials in a different order, the results for the improvement options on a system level are pointing in the same direction, except for plastic recycling scenarios...|$|R

Our objective was to examine EOL health care resource costs among oncology patients in a US commercial insurance population. Methods: A retrospective claims database affiliated with Op-tumInsight was analyzed. Included patients had: a medical claim with cancer diagnosis between July 1, 2002, and December 31, 2009; death on or before December 31, 2009; continuous en-rollment with medical/pharmacy benefits from diagnosis until death; 180 follow-up days; and active cancer in the last 6 months before death (MBD). Death was captured from facility discharge codes or Social Security Administration death files. Costs were determined by summing paid amounts on all ser-vices utilized within the last 6 MBD: cancer-related inpatient (IP) stays, cancer- related hospice care, and cancer-related outpa-tient (OP) services (ie, chemotherapy, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, granulocyte colony-stimulating factors, radiation, can-cer-related office or emergency room visits, cancer-related hos-pital OP procedures, and other services with cancer diagnosis). Results: A total of 28, 530 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean total cancer-related costs in the last 6 MBD were $ 74, 212 (stan-dard deviation, $ 112, 740), comprising IP costs of $ 40, 702 (55 %), OP costs of $ 30, 254 (41 %), and hospice costs of $ 3, 256 (4 %). OP costs decreased from $ 6, 021 in the sixth MBD to $ 2, 238 in the last MBD, whereas IP care costs increased from $ 1, 785 to $ 20, 559.

Exactly 114 patients were analyzed, out of whom a high percent (48. 25 %) had distant metastases at the moment of establishing the diagnosis. Malignant neoplasms of respiratory and intrathoracic organs were leading causes of morbidity. The average costs per patient were significantly different according to the diagnosis, with the highest (13, 114. 10 EUR) and the lowest (4. 00 EUR) ones observed in the breast cancer and melanoma, respectively. The greatest impact on total costs was observed concerning pharmaceuticals, with 42 % of share (monoclonal antibodies amounted to 34 % of all medicines and 14 % of total costs), followed by oncology medical care (21 %), radiation therapy and interventional radiology (11 %), surgery (9 %), imaging diagnostics (9 %) and laboratory costs (8 %).

The greatest impact on total costs was observed concerning pharmaceuticals, with 42 % of share (monoclonal antibodies amounted to 34 % of all medicines and 14 % of total costs), followed by oncology medical care (21 %), radiation therapy and interventional radiology (11 %), surgery (90 %), imaging diagnostics (9 %) and laboratory costs (8 %). CONCLUSION. Cancer treatment incurs high <b>costs,</b> especially for <b>end-of-life</b> pharmaceutical expenses, ensued from medical personnel tendency to improve such patients' quality of life in spite of nearing the end of life. Reimbursement policy on monoclonal antibodies, in particular at end-stage disease, should rely on cost-effectiveness evidence as well as documented clinical efficiency...|$|R
30|$|Therapeutic {{hypothermia}} following resuscitated sudden {{cardiac arrest}} {{has been shown}} to improve both survival and neurological outcomes (Bernard et al. 2002; Arrich et al. 2012). The target temperature at which these benefits are best achieved is, however, unclear. A recent European study found no differences in survival or neurocognitive outcomes whether patients were cooled to 36 or 33 °C. However, cooling to prevent post-arrest fevers, which increase metabolic demand and can exacerbate underlying neurologic injury, appears to be an important management strategy for these patients (Nielsen et al. 2013). The optimal modality to achieve and maintain a target temperature is difficult to determine. Given rising health-care costs and recent cost-containment efforts, particularly surrounding <b>end-of-life</b> resource use, <b>cost</b> effectiveness must be considered in selecting cooling strategies. Thus, this study used an economic decision-analytic model to examine the societal-based cost effectiveness of three alternative cooling strategies. By comparing costs and QALYs of blanket cooling, peritoneal lavage, V–V ECMO, and conventional supportive care, we found that cooling blankets and iced-saline peritoneal lavage are likely to be cost-effective strategies. We found blanket cooling to be the least expensive, but that peritoneal lavage added additional QALYs at a cost of $ 58, 329 per QALY. The ICER of blanket cooling (vs. conventional care) was ~ 23 K/QALY gained. These results are reasonably consistent with results cited in the only other similarly conducted cost-effectiveness analysis (Merchant et al. 2009). In that study, investigators found cooling blankets to be cost-effective versus conventional care, costing $ 47, 168 /QALY. Our finding that cooling blankets were less costly overall {{may be due to the}} inclusion of additional data on effectiveness, which lowered the likelihood of a good outcome given survival with conventional care. Our finding that PL was cost effective is due to PL having lower mortality than the other therapies and similar neurological outcomes to blanket cooling. Because of the high cost of implementing V–V ECMO and its comparative low benefit and poor survival rate, it was dominated by both blanket cooling and peritoneal lavage.|$|R
40|$|Abstract 						Background 					Children’s {{palliative care}} is a {{relatively}} new clinical specialty. Its nature is multi-dimensional and its delivery necessarily multi-professional. Numerous diverse public and not-for-profit organisations typically provide services and support. Because services are not centrally coordinated, they are provided {{in a manner that is}} inconsistent and incoherent. Since the first children’s hospice opened in 1982, the epidemiology of life-limiting conditions has changed with more children living longer, and many requiring transfer to adult services. Very little is known about the number of children living within any given geographical locality, costs of care, or experiences of children with ongoing palliative care needs and their families. We integrated evidence, and undertook and used novel methodological epidemiological work to develop the first evidence-based and costed commissioning exemplar. 						Methods 					Multi-method epidemiological and economic exemplar from a health and not-for-profit organisation perspective, to estimate numbers of children under 19 years with life-limiting conditions, cost current services, determine child/parent care preferences, and <b>cost</b> choice of <b>end-of-life</b> care at home. 						Results 					The exemplar locality (North Wales) had important gaps in service provision and the clinical network. The estimated annual total cost of current children’s palliative care was about £ 5. 5 million; average annual care cost per child was £ 22, 771 using 2007 prevalence estimates and £ 2, 437 - £ 11, 045 using new 2012 / 13 population-based prevalence estimates. Using population-based prevalence, we estimate 2271 children with a life-limiting condition in the general exemplar population and around 501 children per year with ongoing palliative care needs in contact with hospital services. Around 24 children with a wide range of life-limiting conditions require end-of-life care per year. Choice of end-of-life care at home was requested, which is not currently universally available. We estimated a minimum (based on 1 week of <b>end-of-life</b> care) additional <b>cost</b> of £ 336, 000 per year to provide end-of-life support at home. Were end-of-life care to span 4 weeks, the total annual additional costs increases to £ 536, 500 (2010 / 11 prices). 						Conclusions 					Findings make a significant contribution to population-based needs assessment and commissioning methodology in children’s palliative care. Further work is needed to determine with greater precision which children in the total population require access to services and when. Half of children who died 2002 - 7 did not have conditions that met the globally used children's palliative care condition categories, which need revision in light of findings...|$|R
40|$|The {{healthcare}} costs of cancer care are {{highest in the}} last month of life. The effect of hospice care on <b>end-of-life</b> (EOL) healthcare <b>costs</b> is not clearly understood. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of hospice care on survival and {{healthcare costs}} for lung cancer patients in their final month of life. We adopted Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Claims Database to analyze data for 3399 adult lung cancer patients who died in 1997 - 2011. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictors of high healthcare cost, defined as costs falling above the 90 th percentile. Patients who received hospice cares were assigned to a hospice (H) group and those who did not were assigned to a non-hospice (non-H) group. The patients in the H group had a longer mean (median) survival time than those in the non-H group did (1. 40 ± 1. 61 y (0. 86) vs. 1. 10 ± 1. 47 (0. 61), p< 0. 001). The non-H group had a lower mean healthcare cost than the H group (US $ 1, 821 ± 2, 441 vs. US $ 1, 839 ± 1, 638, p< 0. 001). And, there were a total of 340 patients (10 %) with the healthcare costs exceeding the 90 th percentile (US $ 4, 721) as the cutoff value of high cost. The non-H group had a higher risk of high cost than the H group because many more cases in the non-H group had lower costs. Moreover, the risk of high health care costs were predicted for patients who did not receive hospice care (odds ratio [OR]: 3. 68, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2. 44 - 5. 79), received chemotherapy (OR: 1. 51, 95 % CI: 1. 18 - 1. 96) and intubation (OR: 2. 63, 95 % CI: 1. 64 - 4. 16), and those who had more emergency department visits (OR: 1. 78, 95 % CI: 1. 24 - 2. 52), longer hospital admission in days (OR: 1. 08, 95 % CI: 1. 07 - 1. 09), and received radiotherapy (OR: 1. 33, 95 % CI: 1. 00 - 1. 78). Lower risks of high health care costs were observed in patients with low socioeconomic status (OR: 0. 58, 95 % CI: 0. 40 - 0. 83), or previous employment (OR: 0. 66, 95 % CI: 0. 47 - 0. 92). After propensity-score matching, the patients of the non-H group had a higher mean cost and a higher risk of high cost. Similar results were obtained from logistic regression analysis in propensity score-matched patients. The survival of the hospice group was longer than non-H group, and patients in the non-H group were 3. 74 times more likely to have high healthcare costs at EOL. The positive predictors for high health care costs were patients who did not receive hospice care, who received chemotherapy and intubation, who had more emergency department visits and longer hospital admission, and who received radiotherapy. Negative predictors were patients who had a low socioeconomic status or previous employment. The issue of how to reduce the high health care costs for patients with lung cancer {{in the last month}} of life is a challenge for policy makers and health care providers...|$|R
