40|$|The paper surveys {{articles}} {{examining the}} economic impacts of a livestock disease outbreak {{and focuses on}} modeling issues. One set of papers considers setting an <b>import</b> <b>barrier</b> {{when there is a}} livestock disease risk. They show that the level of a risk-based <b>import</b> <b>barrier</b> is sensitive to the impact of disease on economic welfare. The remaining articles focus on estimates of the economic impacts. An outbreak is modeled in a U. S. agricultural sector model and shows the importance of lost exports and consumer response to the magnitude of losses. The final paper argues for de-composition of the welfare impacts. Lessons for future research include improved links to epidemiological research, improved inclusion of trade, extension to non-agricultural sectors, and knowledge of consumer response.

40|$|This is the {{companion}} volume to Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Kimberly Ann Elliott's Measuring the Costs of Protection in the United States (1994). It assesses Japanese trade barriers by identifying price differentials between imports and their (imperfect) domestic substitutes and then calculating the welfare {{effects of the}} implied trade barriers. The authors find that <b>import</b> <b>barrier</b> in place in 1989 cost Japanese consumers $ 105 billion, about 3. 6 percent of GNP. If all such barriers were removed, Japanese imports could increase by $ 47 billion. The authors believe {{that the cost of}} import protection has increased in recent years.

40|$|International {{economics}} has overwhelmingly {{relied on}} Samuelson’s (1954) assumption that trade costs are proportional to value. We build a general equilibrium heterogeneous …rms model of trade {{that allows for}} both ad valorem and per-unit costs. Using a novel minimum distance estimator we identify per-unit trade costs from the distribution of foreign sales across …rms within markets. Estimated average per-unit costs are substantial being, on average, between 35 and 45 percent of the average consumer price. This leads us to reject the pure ad valorem cost assumption. An important theoretical …nding is that a per-unit <b>import</b> <b>barrier</b> is more harmful than an equal yield ad valorem barrier, since per-unit barriers distort relative prices both across and within markets. Since a non-negligible share of existing trade barriers are per-unit, standard welfare assessments of trade liberalization may be understated...|$|R

The first European-style coffeehouse opened in Tokyo in 1888, and closed four years later. By the early 1930s there were over 30,000 coffeehouses across the country; availability in the wartime and immediate postwar period dropped to nearly zero, then rapidly increased as <b>import</b> <b>barriers</b> were removed.

50|$|A {{third factor}} {{affecting}} imports was trade liberalization. Reduced tariff rates and a weakening of other overt trade barriers meant that imports {{should have been}} able to compete more fully in Japan's markets. The extent to which this was true, however, was subject to much debate among analysts. The share of manufactured imports in GNP changed very little from 1970 to 1985, suggesting that falling <b>import</b> <b>barriers</b> had little impact on the propensity to purchase foreign products. Falling trade barriers might become more significant in the 1990s as liberalization continues.|$|E

50|$|There {{were several}} post-World War II changes in {{production}} in Japan that caused post-Fordist conditions to develop. First, there were changes to company structure, including {{the replacement of}} independent trade unions with pro-management, company-based unions; {{the development of a}} core of permanent male multi-skilled workers; {{and the development of a}} periphery of untrained temporary and part-time employees, who were mostly female. Second, after World War II, Japan was somewhat isolated because of <b>import</b> <b>barriers</b> and foreign investment restrictions, and as a result, Japan began to experiment with production techniques. Third, as imported technologies became more available, Japan began to replicate, absorb, and improve them, with many improvements deriving from modifications for local conditions. Fourth, Japan began to concentrate on the need for small-batch production and quick changeover of product lines to serve the demand for a wide range of products in a relatively small market. Because of informal price-fixing, competition was based not on price but rather on product differentiation. As a result, production became less standardized and more specialized, particularly across different companies. Fifth, Japan began to build long-term supply and subcontracting networks, which contrasted with the vertically integrated, Fordist American corporations. Sixth, because small and medium-size manufacturers produced a wide range of products, there was a need for affordable multipurpose equipment as opposed to the specialized, costly production machinery in Fordist industries in the United States. Technology for flexible production was significant in Japan and particularly necessary for smaller producers. The smaller producers also found it necessary to reduce costs. As a result, Japan became one of the main users of robots and CNC. Over time, these six changes in production in Japan were institutionalized.|$|E

The model is empirically calibrated to reflect the U. S. and the rest of the world in the early 1980 's. In this empirical stylization, U.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of trade {{liberalization}} on child work and schooling in Indonesia. Our estimation strategy identifies geographical differences in the effects of trade policy through district and province level exposure to reduction in <b>import</b> tariff <b>barriers.</b> We use seven rounds (1993 to 2002) of the Indonesian annual national household survey (Susenas), and relate workforce participation and school enrolment of children aged 10 - 15 to geographic variation in relative tariff exposure. Our main findings show that increased exposure to trade liberalization is associated with a decrease in child work and an increase in enrolment among 10 to 15 year olds. The effects of tariff reductions are strongest for children from low skill backgrounds and in rural areas. However, a dynamic analysis suggests that these effects reflect the long term benefits of trade liberalization, through economic growth and subsequent income effects, while frictions and negative adjustment effects may occur in the short term.

40|$|This paper uses an applied general equilbrium {{model to}} {{decompose}} {{the effects of}} changes in trade and technology-related variables on wages of skilled and unskilled labor between 1982 and 1996 in the United States. The results indicate that trade-related variables (tariff cuts, improvement {{in the terms of}} trade, and the increase in the trade deficit) had little impact on the widening wage gap. Also, changes in total factor productivity had a small effect on relative wages. The major factor behind the rise in the skilled wage relative to the unskilled wage was differential rates of growth in skill-biased technical change across sectors. The paper also highlights the role that nontraded goods play in explaining the wage gap. Finally, the paper presents estimates of the effect of trade on wages by calculating what wage rates would be under autarky. The results show that expanding trade could actually reduce wage inequality, rather than increase it. The welfare costs to the U. S economy of moving to autarky (using 1996 as a base) are about 6 percent of GDP.
