With such limited data available, there is an urgent need for further research to be conducted on its biology, ecology, habitat, abundance and distribution, before its status can be properly assessed and conservation measures implemented accordingly.

40|$|IMPF: 01. 61 Seahorses (<b>Hippocampus</b> <b>spp.)</b> are non-sex-role-reversed {{members of}} the Syngnathidae family that provide {{extensive}} brood care. Previous studies of seahorses have revealed monogamy within a single brood, but their longer term mating system had not been comprehensively evaluated. The parental contribution to 29 wild-born broods of Hippocampus guttulatus, sampled from six Portuguese populations with differing seahorse densities and sex ratios, was assessed using microsatellite DNA markers. To assess the longer term genetic mating system of this species parentage was determined in eleven broods sampled from a captive population over two breeding seasons. Genetic data suggest that this socially polygamous seahorse is serially monogamous across breeding seasons, i. e. monogamous within a season but may switch mates between seasons, and that differing population densities and sex ratios do not affect the mating system. preprintPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Syngnathid fish (pipefish and seahorses) {{are unique}} among teleost fish in that their ovary {{consists}} of a rolled sheet with germinal ridge(s) on the dorsal side running along {{the entire length of}} the sheet. A distinct difference is seen in the ovarian structure between polygamous Syngnathus pipefish and monogamous seahorses (<b>Hippocampus</b> <b>spp.),</b> the former having one germinal ridge and the latter with two ridges. This study examined the ovarian structure and the mode of egg production in a monogamous pipefish Corythoichthys haematopterus. The ovary of C. haematopterus had two germinal ridges like that observed in monogamous seahorses. There were two distinct groups of follicles in the ovary, one being a cohort of extremely small follicles and the other a cohort of follicles developing and increasing in size with the passage of time. We suggest that the ovarian structure and the mode of egg production in this pipefish are adaptations to monogamy...|$|E
40|$|Seahorses (<b>Hippocampus</b> <b>spp.)</b> are in much {{demand for}} {{traditional}} medicines and curios in dried form, and as aquarium fish when alive. Shallow seas abundant in sea grasses, sponges and corals characterise the natural habitats of the seahorses (Vincent 1994, 1995). All seahorses (Syngnathidae) belong to one genus Hippocampus. There are about 33 species of seahorses worldwide (Lourie, Vincent & Hall 1999; Lourie & Randall 2003). Seahorses are unique in their reproductive behaviour, {{in which the}} males become pregnant. The male fertilises and broods the eggs produced and deposited into its pouch by the female during courtship and mating, and in turn delivers the hatchling, after {{a long period of}} pregnancy and labour. Most species of seahorses studied so far show unique sexual fidelity and form faithful pair bonds (Vincent & Sadler 1995), in which case one male and one female mate repeatedly and exclusively giving up opportunities to interact with non-partners...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of {{the biology}} and ecology of {{seahorses}} (<b>Hippocampus</b> <b>spp.)</b> is scarce, {{but has been}} increasing in recent years due to their conservation status. Captivity breeding programmescan be a valuable source {{of information on the}} reproductive biology of seahorses. A captive broodstock of Hippocampus guttulatus Cuvier 1829 was established in 2006 and kept under natural-like photoperiod and temperature. Female maturation was studied during the whole reproductive season in 2007. Most egg clutches were released from May (17 ◦C; 15 L: 9 D) to October (18 ◦C; 13 L: 11 D), with peak releases occurring in June–August (20 ◦C; 16 L: 8 D– 14 L: 10 D). Throughout the study, four egg morphotypes were found;tworegression equations were proposed for estimating egg/yolk volume based on measurements of egg and yolk biometrics. Female weight was positively correlated with yolk volume/egg volume ratio (Yv/Ev) (rs = 0. 523, n = 21, P < 0. 05) but not with Ev or Yv. Egg dry weight (567 ± 141 g) was correlated with Yv (rs = 0. 384, n = 31, P < 0. 05). Meanclutch size and clutch biomass were 242 ± 142 eggs and 137 ± 87 mg dry weight, respectively. Clutch size was positively correlated to female weight (rs = 0. 479, n = 25, P < 0. 05). Inter-clutch intervals (days) were affected by temperature (◦C) as described by the following equation: Interval = 357. 55 e− 0. 1283 Temp.

40|$|Wild {{seahorses}} {{are currently}} being collected in large numbers {{for use as a}} traditional medicine, for ornamental display and as a curio. This in conjunction with habitat disruption, low fecundity and a general lack of scientific knowledge has lead to concern regarding future wild stock viability. In order to reduce pressure on wild stocks, numerous countries have protected some or all species, prohibiting the capture or movement of seahorses. However, demand for seahorses remains high, which has lead to numerous captive breeding initiatives by public aquaria and the recent development of seahorse fanns (although as yet commercially unviable). Disease in seahorses seems comparable to other marine teleosts, with high mortalities common post birth, and is a major stumbling block for a consistently successful commercial operation. Despite this, the 'normal' microflora of seahorses is largely unknown. This study characterised the microflora found associated with two species of moribund and apparently healthy juvenile and young adult seahorses {Hippocampus kuda and H. fuscus) from three seahorse rearing facilities, and one sample of juvenile seahorse Artemia feed from one seahorse rearing facility. Histological analysis of juvenile moribund H. fuscus and H. kuda along with a moribund adult H. erectus and H. abdomanalis was also conducted. Phenotypic and biochemical analysis of the microflora found most isolates to be Vibrio spp., with Vibrio alginolyticus an 6 V. splendidus being two possible prominent strains found in animalis from all three sample sites. The sample of Artemia feed seems likely to not have been a Vibrio spp. Histological analysis revealed moribund juveniles not to have pathogenic bacteria, but the two moribund adults contained extensive gram positive bacterial colonies within the musculature, liver, kidney and surrounding the pericardium.

40|$|This work {{comprehensively}} {{reviews the}} international trade in sea horses, particularly the Hippocampus genus, from 1997 to 2012. The genus {{was added to the}} Appendices II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (thereinafter as the CITES) in 2002, came into force in 2004. Before the addition, the genus was entered into the appendix D for the non-CITES species whose import is monitored by the EU. The CITES Trade Database kept by the UNEP - WCMC Secretariat was used as the source of data about the trade. The frequency of the trade in sea horses tended to be increasing with a moderate decrease in 2009. The Hippocampus species was traded in the following forms: live, bodies, derivatives, specimens, medicine, carvings, eggs live, extracts, fingerlings, powder, skeletons, skin pieces, soup, trophies and other unspecified forms. The living specimens traded: (1) specimens taken from the wild., (2) animals bred in captivity as well as parts and derivatives, (3) Animals born in captivity (F 1 or subsequent generations) that do not fulfil the definition of 'bred in captivity', as well as parts and derivatives thereof, (4) specimens of animals reared in a controlled environment, taken as eggs or juveniles from the wild, where they would otherwise have had a very low probability of surviving to adulthood, (5) confiscated or seized specimens, (6) pre- Convention specimens. The trades purposes were: (1) commercial, (2) personal, (3) scientific, (4) zoo (aquarium) breeding, (5) educational, (6) breeding in captivity, circus and other exhibitions, (7) conventional medicine, (8) law enforcement / judicial / forensic purposes. The most traded genus was unspecified (<b>Hippocampus</b> <b>spp.),</b> then the H. kuda, the H. reidi and the H. erectus as living specimens or dead bodies; also the ones from the wild and for the commercial purposes. Those came mostly from Vietnam, Thailand or Australia. They were exported mainly from Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Australia. The greatest importers were the USA, Germany and the Great Britain...|$|E
