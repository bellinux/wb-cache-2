Choo et al. looked at Information Culture as the socially shared patterns of behaviors, norms and values that define the significance and use of information in an organization. Also, scholars like Manuel Castells posits that the Information Culture transcends the confines of organizations and government participation through policies is relevant for achieving the norms and values.

Visual appearance {{is known to be}} very useful in place recognition tasks. In recent years, {{it has been shown that}} taking geometric information also into account further improves system robustness. Stereo visual systems provide 3 D information and texture of nearby regions, as well as an image of far regions. In order to make use of all this information, our system builds two probabilistic undirected graphs, each considering either near or <b>far</b> <b>information.</b> Inference is carried out in the framework of conditional random fields. We evaluate our algorithm in public indoor and outdoor datasets from the RAWSEEDS project and in an outdoor dataset obtained at the MIT campus.

40|$|When {{steering}} down {{a winding}} road, drivers {{have been shown}} to use both near and far regions of the road for guidance during steering. We propose a model of steering that explicitly embodies this idea, using both a “near point ” to maintain a central lane position and a “far point” to account for the upcoming roadway. Unlike control models that integrate near and <b>far</b> <b>information</b> to compute curvature or more complex features, our model relies solely on one perceptually-plausible feature of the near and far points, namely the visual direction to each point. The resulting parsimonious model can be run in simulation within a realistic highway environment to facilitate direct comparison between model and human behavior. Using such simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed two-point model is able to account for four interesting aspects of steering behavior: curve negotiation with occluded visual regions, corrective steering after a lateral drift, lane changing, and individual differences.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} joint {{estimation of the}} channel length and of the impulse response for OFDM systems, exploiting information criteria {{to find the best}} trade-off, in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence, between noise rejection and channel description accuracy. So <b>far,</b> <b>information</b> criteria have not been used for practical channel length estimation methods, due to their prohibitive complexity. We show how to make them affordable, performing channel estimation in a recursive way that allows to establish the optimal channel length with a moderate incremental cost. With reference to IEEE 802. 11 OFDM-based standards for WLAN, we investigate several cases, applying the joint channel length and impulse response estimation to many scenarios, ranging from the simplest pilot-aided channel estimation based on training sequences, to the most challenging data-aided channel tracking, driven either by detected or by decoded symbols. In all cases, the achieved performance and robustness are very good, with a very small increase in complexity w. r. t. estimation methods that assume fixed channel length...|$|E
40|$|In 1976, {{we began}} a {{comprehensive}} evaluation of 2 ̆ 2 Vexar 2 ̆ 2 seedling protectors {{as a means}} of reducing damage to conifer seedlings by pocket gophers (Thomomys spp.). The protectors are cylinders of plastic netting that gradually decompose in sunlight. The evaluation is being conducted on four national forests in three western states. Three conifer species, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), and Shasta red fir (Abies magnifica var. shastensis), are under study. After two growing seasons, gophers have caused only 5 percent mortality among 2 ̆ 2 Vexar 2 ̆ 2 -enclosed seedlings compared to 20 percent mortality among unprotected seedlings. In addition, stocking and heights of protected seedlings are better than those of unprotected seedlings.

These two cancer hallmarks are modulated by enzymes of the LOX family, but thus <b>far,</b> <b>information</b> about LOX relevance in tumor-associated pericytes is lacking. Here, we performed a comparative characterization of normal and tumoral pericytes and report {{for the first time}} the modulatory effects of LOX enzymes on activated pericyte properties. Tumoral pericytes isolated from childhood ependymoma and neuroblastoma specimens displayed angiogenic properties in vitro and expressed typical markers, including CD 146, NG 2, and PDGFRβ. Expression of all LOX family members could be detected in both normal and tumor-associated pericytes. In most pericyte samples, LOXL 3 was the family member displaying the highest transcript levels. Inhibition of LOX/LOXL activity with the inhibitor β-aminopropionitrile (βAPN) significantly reduced migration of pericytes, while proliferation rates were kept unaltered. Formation of tube-like structures in vitro by pericytes was also significantly impaired upon inhibition of LOX/LOXL activity with βAPN, which induced more prominent effects in tumor-associated pericytes. These findings reveal a novel involvement of the LOX family of enzymes in migration and angiogenic properties of pericytes, with implications in tumor development and in therapeutic targeting tumor microenvironment constituents...|$|E
40|$|Cerium oxide {{nanoparticles}} (NPs) or nanoceria have a {{high level}} of UV absorption and antioxidant behavior, making them great candidates for sun screens, beauty products, and in treating cancer and glaucoma. The increased use of these NPs underscores the importance of understanding their environmental fate and toxicity. So <b>far,</b> <b>information</b> about nanoceria toxicity to plants is scarce. The objectives of this study are to determine the effect of CeO 2 NPs on soybean (Glycine max) plant growth and monitor their uptake, deposition, and biotransformation. Soybean plants were treated for 14 days in a modified Hoagland solution containing varying concentrations of CeO 2 NPs (0, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 mg/L). Leaves, stems, and roots of the treated soybean plants were analyzed separately using ICP-OES and XAS. The ICP-OES results showed cerium concentrations in roots varying from 37068 - 74774 mg kg- 1. In stems and leaves there was a maximum cerium concentration of 3028 and 1048 mg kg- 1, respectively. XAS results suggest that soybeans absorb and store the nanoceria without any biotransformation. Increased growth and growth abnormalities in leaves were found in those plants treated with NPs. A high rate of translocation indicates promising use of soybeans in nanoceria phytoremediation...|$|E

This research aims to explore the methods used to allocate resources; it focuses on the features of the budget and the MoHE format used in these universities.

So <b>far,</b> <b>information</b> on sea turtle bycatch in Italy is limited both in space and time due to logistical problems in data collected through onboard observations and on a limited number of vessels involved. In the present study, sea turtle bycatch in Italian waters was examined by collecting fishermen’s information on turtle bycatch through an interview-based approach. Their replies enabled the identification of bycatch hotspots in relation to area, season and to the main gear types. The most harmful fishing gears resulted to be trawl nets, showing the highest probabilities of turtle bycatch with a hotspot in the Adriatic Sea, followed by longlines in the Ionian Sea and in the Sicily Channel. Estimates obtained by the present results showed that more than 52, 000 capture events and 10, 000 deaths occurred in Italian waters in 2014, highlighting a more alarming scenario than earlier studies. The work shows that in case of poor data from other sources, direct questioning of fishermen and stakeholders could represent a useful and cost-effective approach capable of providing sufficient data to estimate annual bycatch rates and identify high-risk gear/location/season combinations...|$|E
