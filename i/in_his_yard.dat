5|$|In September 1945, Minton {{suffered}} a heart attack while in Washington; he was hospitalized for three months at Walter Reed Hospital. After returning to work, he was forced to rest regularly due to gradually worsening anemia, and he sought to lessen his workload. To further complicate his health, on August 5, 1949, Minton tripped over a stone <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> and broke his leg. The injury forced him to walk with a cane for the remainder of his life.|$|E
5|$|The severed ear that Jeffrey discovers {{is also a}} key {{symbolic}} element, leading Jeffrey into danger. Indeed, just as Jeffrey's troubles begin, {{the audience}} is treated to a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the canal of the severed, decomposing ear. Notably, the camera does not reemerge from the ear canal {{until the end of}} the film. When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, the ear canal shot is replayed, only in reverse, zooming out through Jeffrey's own ear as he relaxes <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> on a summer day.|$|E

25|$|A 1935 {{article in}} Popular Aviation magazine, which renewed {{interest}} in Whitehead, said winter weather ruined the Number 22 airplane after Whitehead placed it unprotected <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> following his claimed flights of January 1902. The article said Whitehead did not have money to build a shelter for the aircraft because of a quarrel with his financial backer. The article also reported that in early 1903 Whitehead built a 200-horsepower eight-cylinder engine, intended to power a new aircraft. Another financial backer insisted on testing the engine in a boat on Long Island Sound, but lost control and capsized, sending the engine to the bottom.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Gacy and an {{employee}} of PDM Contractors traveled to Florida to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night the two were alone in Florida, Gacy raped the youth in their hotel room. As a result, this youth refused {{to stay in the}} same hotel room as Gacy and instead slept on the beach. Upon returning to Chicago, this employee drove to Gacy's house as he was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> and beat him. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the youth from further attacking Gacy and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack happened because he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality work.|$|E

25|$|In the {{afternoon}} of Wednesday, May 5, 1886, strikers again assembled to march on the company town of Bay View. This time, new orders had been issued {{to the members of}} the National Guard by Governor Rusk — that, in the event of the repeat of mob tactics, the guardsmen should this time shoot to kill. Guardsmen blocked the road. When the approaching strikers were 1000 yards away, commanding officer Major George P. Traeumer gave the command to fire and a hail of bullets was unleashed on the crowd. The number wounded will never be known, having been carried away by the fleeing crowd, but eight people died in what is today remembered as the Bay View Massacre. Included among these was an old man who had been feeding chickens <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> and a young schoolboy.|$|E

Meanwhile, his friends Stan, Kyle and Kenny participate on America's Stupidest Home Videos, after filming Cartman playing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> with plush toys.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{was born}} in Marion, Ohio, Huff grew up in Mineral Wells, Texas. When he was six years old, his father, Aubrey II, was killed as an {{innocent}} bystander in a domestic dispute while working as an electrician. That left Huff's mother Fonda in charge of raising him and his sister Angela. Growing up, Huff regularly practiced baseball <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>yard,</b> which had a batting cage with lights and a pitching machine. He said, [...] " [...] it more to keep me out of trouble." [...] He grew up rooting for the Texas Rangers and frequently attended their games. One of his favorite players was Nolan Ryan. Huff initially attended Mineral Wells High School but then transferred to Brewer High School when his family moved to Fort Worth. Although he was selected to the All-District baseball team in high school, he was better known as a basketball player. He graduated in 1995.|$|E

500|$|Among other {{contemporary}} rock musicians, Stephen Stills was {{so taken}} with the song that he had its lyrics carved on a stone monument <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>yard.</b> Lennon also admired the track, saying of Harrison: [...] "His mind and his music are clear. There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together." [...] David Crosby, who introduced Harrison to Shankar's music in 1965, described Harrison's fusion of ideas as [...] "utterly brilliant", adding: [...] "He did it beautifully and tastefully... He did it at absolutely the highest level that he could, and I was extremely proud of him for that." [...] Writing in the [...] "100 Rock Icons" [...] issue of Classic Rock, in 2006, singer Paul Rodgers cited the track to support Harrison's standing as what the magazine called [...] "the Beatles' musical medicine man". Rodgers said: [...] "He introduced me and a generation of people worldwide to {{the wisdom of the}} East. His thought-provoking 'Within You Without You' – with sitars, tablas and deep lyrics – was something completely different, even in a world full of unique music." ...|$|E
500|$|On 25 April, the Ustaše {{arrested a}} Serb named Milan Radovanović {{when he stopped}} by the Bjelovar police station to hand over his rifle. He had fought with the VKJ {{at the time of}} the {{invasion}} and spent two weeks hiding in the forests before returning to his home in Prgomelje. His relatively late return prevented him from handing over his rifle before the Ustaše deadline on 24 April. On the morning of 26 April, as Radovanović and another Serb prisoner were being escorted from the county jail by two Ustaše guards, two unidentified gunmen opened fire on the detainees and guards. A skirmish ensued, and Radovanović and one of the guards were killed. The second guard was wounded. That afternoon, a Croatian Home Guard (or domobran) was killed by a stray bullet <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> while on leave. Kvaternik immediately blamed the deaths on [...] "Serb agitators". In their internal documents, the Ustaše attributed the deaths to [...] "local Chetniks", a claim that has never been proven. Some historians have hypothesized that the attack on the county jail and the death of the Home Guard were false flag attacks intended to rally Croats against local Serbs. This allegation has also never been proven.|$|E

Reiss gave Januszkiewicz permission to release his messages. In 1993, the Catholic Diocese of Trenton ruled that nothing [...] "truly miraculous" [...] was happening at the Januszkiewicz home. Pictures were taken in November 2004 of a mist that {{showed up at the}} location of the vision, though by April 2005, Januszkiewicz claimed that the visions had stopped and he reports there have been no sightings since.|$|E

2500|$|Remington's [...] "Explorers" [...] series, {{depicting}} older {{historical events}} in western U.S. history, did not fare {{well with the}} public or the critics. The financial panic of 1907 caused a slow down in his sales and in 1908, fantasy artists, such as Maxfield Parrish, became popular with the public and with commercial sponsors. Remington tried to sell his home in New Rochelle to get further away from urbanization. One night he made a bonfire <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>yard</b> and burned dozens of his oil paintings which had been used for magazine illustration (worth millions of dollars today), making an emphatic statement that he was done with illustration forever. He wrote, [...] "there is nothing left but my landscape studies". Near {{the end of his}} life, he moved to Ridgefield, Connecticut. In his final two years, under the influence of The Ten, he was veering more heavily to Impressionism, and he regretted that he was studio bound (by virtue of his declining health) and could not follow his peers who painted [...] "plein air".|$|E
