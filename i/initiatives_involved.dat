40|$|Part 2 : Acceptance and DiffusionInternational audienceDelivering public {{services}} through the SMS channel is becoming popular and has demonstrated its benefits. Some of the <b>initiatives</b> <b>involved</b> big investment. However, citizens’ {{acceptance of the}} services is still an issue. This paper presents a study on user acceptance of SMS-based e-government services. It assesses the adequacy of four prominent models of technology adoption (TRA, TAM, TPB, and DTPB) to explain intention to use SMS-based egovernment services and proposes a generic model of individual acceptance of SMS-based e-government services. Constructs of the proposed model were derived from a survey on citizens’ motivations for using SMS-based egovernment services, theories on individual acceptance of technologies, and user acceptance determinants of SMS and e-government services. Data for validating the models were collected from 589 citizens in three cities in Indonesia. The proposed model may explain why individuals accept or reject SMS-based e-government services and how user acceptance {{is influenced by the}} service characteristics...|$|E
40|$|In higher {{education}} settings, assessment tasks {{get the attention}} of students, but once students submit their work they typically become disengaged with the assessment process. Hence, opportunities for learning are lost as they become passive recipients of assessment outcomes. Future-learning oriented assessment engages students in the assessment process to improve both short- and long-term outcomes by requiring students to make sophisticated judgments about their own learning, and that of their peers. In this paper, we describe and critique three initiatives that experimented with future-learning oriented assessment within a faculty of education. These <b>initiatives</b> <b>involved</b> self- and peer-assessment in a mathematics education subject for first year pre-service teachers; peer assessment of individual contributions in a group project using a Wiki; and self- and peer-assessment to help students learn about leadership. Based on our experiences, we conclude with suggestions of how others might also use self- and peer-assessment to work towards better short- and long-term learning outcomes in {{higher education}}...|$|E
40|$|Poverty maps {{have become}} popular among {{researchers}} {{and policy makers}} in manyregions {{over the last few}} years, including Southeast Asia, where Cambodia has been a leader in this trend. Cambodia was the first country in Asia to produce poverty maps based on the small area estimation methodology developed by Elbers, Lanjouw, and Lanjouw (2002, 2003), which is now the standard method for poverty mapping. 1 This chapter describes poverty mapping in Cambodia and the lessons that have been learned there and are potentially applicable to other countries. In particular, the chapter provides a detailed account of the contributions poverty maps have made to policy making and the challenges involved. The discussion is based on the author’s own experience, as well as on extensive interviews with key stakeholders. The chapter is organized as follows.
