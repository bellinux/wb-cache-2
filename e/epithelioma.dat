40|$|Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha) is {{a potent}} mitogen for {{epithelial}} cells that has been localized to normal human appendageal epithelia. To further understand the role of TGF alpha in human appendages, we examined TGF alpha expression immunohistochemically in 17 types of human appendageal tumors differentiating toward hair follicles, eccrine, apocrine, and sebaceous glands. In order of decreasing degrees of differentiation, tumors could be divided into hyperplasias, adenomas, benign <b>epitheliomas,</b> and primordial <b>epitheliomas.</b> Using an antibody that recognizes primarily the 6 -kd and 13 -kd forms of TGF alpha, TGF alpha immunostaining in 16 of 17 tumor types analyzed was found to follow a similar pattern, with expression in hyperplasias greater than adenomas greater than benign <b>epitheliomas</b> greater than primordial <b>epitheliomas.</b> Within a given tumor, TGF alpha expression also correlated well with the known differentiation state of the tumor cell types. The results suggest that TGF alpha expression is directly correlated with the differentiation state of hair follicle, eccrine, apocrine, and sebaceous tumors in human skin, and {{raises the possibility that}} TGF alpha {{may play a role in}} the differentiation of appendageal epithelia...|$|R

500|$|On 17 May, Gerhardt {{and other}} doctors, {{including}} Ernst von Bergmann, diagnosed the growth as laryngeal cancer. Bergmann recommended consulting a leading British cancer specialist, Morell Mackenzie; he also recommended a thyrotomy to gain {{better access to}} the inside of the larynx, followed by the complete removal of the larynx - a total laryngectomy - if the situation proved serious. While Victoria was informed of the need for an immediate operation, Frederick was not told. Despite the tentative diagnosis of cancer, the doctors hoped the growth would prove to be a benign <b>epithelioma.</b> A room on the top floor of the Crown Prince's palace was then equipped as an operating theatre, but Bergmann elected to put the operation on hold until Mackenzie could provide his assessment. Mackenzie arrived in Berlin on 20 May, but after examining Frederick recommended a biopsy of the growth to determine whether or not it was malignant. He conducted the biopsy the following morning, after which he sent tissue samples to the distinguished pathologist Rudolf Virchow for microscopic examination. When Virchow was unable to detect any cancerous cells despite several separate analyses, Mackenzie declared his opposition to a laryngectomy being performed, as he felt it would be invariably fatal, and said he would assume charge of the case. He gave his assurance that Frederick would fully recover [...] "in a few months." [...] While Gerhardt and Physician-General August Wegner concurred with Mackenzie, Bergmann and his colleague Adalbert Tobold held to their original diagnosis of cancer. In addition to Mackenzie's opinion, Bismarck strongly opposed any major operation on Frederick's throat, and pressed the Kaiser to veto it. On 9 June, Mackenzie again biopsied the growth and sent the samples to Virchow, who reported the following day that he was again unable to detect any signs of cancer.|$|E
2500|$|Mule spinners' {{cancer or}} mule-spinners' cancer [...] was a cancer, an <b>epithelioma</b> of the scrotum. It was first {{reported}} in 1887 in a cotton mule spinner. In 1926, a British Home Office committee strongly favoured {{the view that}} this form of cancer {{was caused by the}} prolonged action of mineral oils on the skin of the scrotum, and of these oils, shale oil was deemed to be the most carcinogenic.

40|$|The {{activities}} of ornithine decarboxylase and of S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase in human normal epidermis, in basal cell <b>epitheliomas,</b> and in squamous cell carcinomas of human skin have been compared. All 3 types of tissues have characteristic levels {{of each of}} these enzymes. The normal epidermis had the lowest levels of both ornithine decarboxylase and S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase activities. The levels of the polyamine biosynthetic decarboxylases in basal cell <b>epitheliomas</b> were significantly higher than those of normal epidermis, {{but at the same time}} significantly lower than those present in squamous cell carcinomas. These results support the conclusion that in epithelial malignant tumors of human skin the extent of the increase in the {{activities of}} polyamine biosynthetic decarboxylases is well correlated with the neoplasm's growth rate, which is faster in the squamous cell carcinomas than in the basal cell <b>epitheliomas...</b>|$|R

2500|$|In February 1923, Freud {{detected}} a leukoplakia, a benign growth associated with heavy smoking, on his mouth. Freud initially kept this secret, but in April 1923 he informed Ernest Jones, {{telling him that}} the growth had been removed. Freud consulted the dermatologist Maximilian Steiner, who advised him to quit smoking but lied about the growth's seriousness, minimizing its importance. Freud later saw Felix Deutsch, who saw that the growth was cancerous; he identified it to Freud using the euphemism [...] "a bad leukoplakia" [...] instead of the technical diagnosis <b>epithelioma.</b> Deutsch advised Freud to stop smoking and have the growth excised. Freud was treated by Marcus Hajek, a rhinologist whose competence he had previously questioned. Hajek performed an unnecessary cosmetic surgery in his clinic's outpatient department. Freud bled {{during and after the}} operation, and may narrowly have escaped death. Freud subsequently saw Deutsch again. Deutsch saw that further surgery would be required, but did not tell Freud that he had cancer because he was worried that Freud might wish to commit suicide.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. -Medication with L-thyroxine or {{methylthiouracil}} of castrate rats painted weekly 5, 10, 20 or 40 {{times with}} DMBA does {{not alter the}} order of thresholds for carcinogenesis which increases from that for cervico-vaginal <b>epitheliomas</b> via squamous celled and basal celled vulval tumours to cervicovaginal sarcomas.

Sarcomas reach a peak of 25 % with 20 doses of DMBA in non-medicated rats, but rise to 90 % and {{at a faster rate}} in animals given either of the thyroactive drugs with further carcinogenic treatment. The optimal dose phenomenon for cervico-vaginal <b>epitheliomas,</b> i. e. a significant fall with continued painting from a peak reached by 5 to 20 doses of DMBA, is not affected by medication with methylthiouracil or L-thyroxine.

40|$|SUMMARY. -The {{effect of}} varying the numbers (4, 5, 10, 20 and 40) of weekly {{applications}} of DMBA to the dorsal skin of intact and castrate {{male and female}} rats on the induction of basal and squamous celled <b>epitheliomas</b> and of sarcomas has been investigated. Basal celled tumours originate mainly in hair follicles and squamous celled neoplasms in the interfollicular regions of the epiderml. 's and differ in their progression to malignancy. Penetration of the panniculus carnosus is neither a sufficient nor necessary criterion of malignancy since growing hair follicles pass through the muscle layer and carcinomas and sarcomas which are still confined to the dermis, spread along the perineural lymphatics and metastasise to the lungs. Sex and castration do not affect carcinogenesis of <b>epitheliomas</b> in the dorsal skin at any dose level. Significantly more sarcomas result from 20 weekly paintings in male than in female or castrate rats. The induction period for all tumour types is shortened in sensitive individual...|$|R
40|$|Circumanal gland {{tumors are}} very common {{neoplasms}} of dogs. Their classification relies on microscopic examination and is further {{supported by a}} few immunohistochemical markers that help indicate their prognosis. However, new additional tests would be highly useful. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop such a test using fractal analysis which is increasingly being applied in science, especially in the field of biomedicine. A total of 53 circumanal gland tumors were chosen from our department archives. After a precise histological classification according to the World Health Organization classification, the number of de novo classified samples was as follows: 15 adenomas, 11 <b>epitheliomas,</b> 21 well differentiated carcinomas, 6 poorly differentiated carcinomas. Ten samples of normal circumanal gland were also included as control. All samples were immunohistochemicaly stained with vimentin. All immunohistochemical reactions were photographed at two different magnifications - 100 X and 400 X and converted to 1 bit in black and white (bitmap) images thus enhancing the positive vimentin reactions. These images were used for the assessment of fractal dimension applying the box counting method and computer software Fractalyse. To determine the significance of results, conventional statistics were performed using Statistica software. The overall vimentin stain score was significantly higher in <b>epitheliomas</b> and carcinomas than in normal circumanal glands (CG) or adenomas. Mean values of fractal dimension estimated at magnification 100 X and 400 X were as follows: normal CG 1. 318 and 1. 372, CG adenomas 1. 384 and 1. 408, CG <b>epitheliomas</b> 1. 547 and 1. 597, CG well differentiated carcinomas 1. 569 and 1. 607, CG poorly differentiated carcinomas 1. 679 and 1. 723. Significant differences (at level of 5 %) of these values were observed between individual groups of CG adenomas or normal CG, and <b>epitheliomas</b> or carcinomas. The above results indicate vimentin immunohistochemistry staining and assessment of fractal dimension as an ancillary diagnostic method of choice when discerning between benign and malignant tumors of circumanal glands. Additional development of the method of fractal dimension assesment may yield a possibility for this tool to successfully discern between all of the types of CG tumors. </p...|$|R
