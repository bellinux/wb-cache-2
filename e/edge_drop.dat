6000|$|The antiquity-mongers in Venice {{have all}} the courage of their opinion, and {{it is easy to}} see how well they know they can {{confound}} you with an unanswerable question. What is the whole place but a curiosity-shop, and what are you here for yourself but to pick up odds and ends? [...] "We pick them up for you," [...] say these honest Jews, whose prices are marked in dollars, [...] "and who shall blame us if, the flowers being pretty well plucked, we add an artificial rose or two to the composition of the bouquet?" [...] They take care, in a word, that there be plenty of relics, and their establishments are huge and active. They administer the antidote to pedantry, and you can complain of them only if you never cross their thresholds. If you take this step you are lost, for you have parted with the correctness of your attitude. Venice becomes frankly from such a moment the big depressing dazzling joke in which after all our sense of her contradictions sinks to rest--the grimace of an over-strained philosophy. It's rather a comfort, for the curiosity-shops are amusing. You have bad moments indeed as you stand in their halls of humbug and, in the intervals of haggling, hear through the high windows the soft splash of the sea on the old water-steps, for you think with anger of the noble homes that are laid waste in such scenes, of the delicate lives that must have been, that might still be, led there. You reconstruct the admirable house according to your own needs; leaning on a back balcony, you drop your eyes into one of the little green gardens with which, for the most part, such establishments are exasperatingly blessed, and end by feeling it a shame that you yourself are not in possession. (I take for granted, of course, that as you go and come you are, in imagination, perpetually lodging yourself and setting up your gods; for if this innocent pastime, this borrowing of the mind, be not your favourite sport there is a flaw in the appeal that Venice makes to you.) There may be happy cases in which your envy is tempered, or perhaps I should rather say intensified, by real participation. If you have had the good fortune to enjoy the hospitality of an old Venetian home and to lead your life a little in the painted chambers that still echo with one of the historic names, you have entered by the shortest step into the inner spirit of the place. If it did n't savour of treachery to private kindness I should like to speak frankly of one of these delightful, even though alienated, structures, to refer to it as a splendid example of the old palatial type. But I can only do so in passing, with a hundred precautions, and, lifting the curtain at the <b>edge,</b> <b>drop</b> a commemorative word on the success with which, in this particularly happy instance, the cosmopolite habit, the modern sympathy, the intelligent, flexible attitude, the latest fruit of time, adjust themselves to the great gilded, relinquished shell and try to fill it out. A Venetian palace that has not too grossly suffered and that is not overwhelming by its mass makes almost any life graceful that may be led in it. With cultivated and generous contemporary ways it reveals a pre- established harmony. As you live in it day after day its beauty and its interest sink more deeply into your spirit; it has its moods and its hours and its mystic voices and its shifting expressions. If in the absence of its masters you have happened to have it to yourself for twenty-four hours you will never forget the charm of its haunted stillness, late on the summer afternoon for instance, when the call of playing children comes in behind from the campo, nor the way the old ghosts seemed to pass on tip-toe on the marble floors. It gives you practically the essence of the matter that we are considering, for beneath the high balconies Venice comes and goes, and the particular stretch you command contains all the characteristics. Everything has its turn, from the heavy barges of merchandise, pushed by long poles and the patient shoulder, to the floating pavilions of the great serenades, and you may study at your leisure the admirable Venetian arts of managing a boat and organising a spectacle. Of the beautiful free stroke with which the gondola, especially when there are two oars, is impelled, you never, in the Venetian scene, grow weary; it is always in the picture, and the large profiled action that lets the standing rowers throw themselves forward to a constant recovery has the double value of being, at the fag-end of greatness, the only energetic note. The people from the hotels are always afloat, and, at the hotel pace, the solitary gondolier (like the solitary horseman of the old- fashioned novel) is, I confess, a somewhat melancholy figure. Perched on his poop without a mate, he re-enacts perpetually, in high relief, with his toes turned out, the comedy of his odd and charming movement. He always has a little the look of an absent- minded nursery-maid pushing her small charges in a perambulator.|$|E

[...] It simply ascends the tower and then drops down, with the track curving to horizontal, leaving riders on their backs. Others were built for other parks (some of which are Six Flags).

Realizing the coupling relationship quantitative analysis and decoupling control of them {{is one of the}} most important parts of achieving the high-precision control. In this paper, the flatness and <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> control abilities of all the control actuators are analyzed. The coupling relationship between flatness and <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> is analyzed. The decoupling control method is proposed to realize the decoupling control of flatness and <b>edge</b> <b>drop.</b> Simulation results represent that the flatness and <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> control performance is improved effectively...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Aiming at {{the strip}} <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> control, the three {{dimensional}} finite element roll system models were built. From {{the point of}} the burdened load and deformation of the roll system, the reason which caused the strip <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> and its composing were analyzed, and the critical width was proposed to control the strip <b>edge</b> <b>drop.</b> Based on the FEM analysis and industrial experiment, the VCR (Varying contact backup rolls) matching the EDW (<b>Edge</b> <b>drop</b> control work rolls) was designed and proposed independently. The application of such rolls gives better mill crown control ability, a high performance of work roll bending force and the improved strip <b>edge</b> <b>drop,</b> crown and flatness quality...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Edge</b> <b>drop</b> is an {{important}} quality evaluating index for strip cross-section with the increasing of requirement for higher gauge accuracy to meet customer's demand. The mathematical model of roll shifting system plays {{an important}} role in controlling the <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> on modern tandem cold rolling mills. Based on the explicit dynamic finite element method, a 3 D finite element simulation model of rolls and strip is established for a large ultra-wide 6 -high cold rolling mill with the developed EDW (<b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> control work roll) and the matched CVC intermediate roll to investigate the effect of work roll shift on <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> of strip. Considering on the characteristics of EDW work rolls, equivalent area compensated method has been put forward to build the shifting model for <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> control. The results indicated that the values of <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> are less than 7 µm by using the proper shifting model and the shifting model can be used to guide the practical production...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Edge-drop control enlarges {{the shape}} control {{theories}} and technologies. But {{compared to the}} profile and flatness control technology, the <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> control is a developing topic. This paper analyze the influence of strip thickness, strip width, reduction ratio, friction coefficient and deformation resistance on the <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> based on the elastic deformation of rolls and the three-dimensional plastic deformation of strip for UCMW cold rolling mill. The results will support the further research on the <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> control for cold rolling mill...|$|E
30|$|The most {{advanced}} <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> control technology at present is the K-WRS {{technology of the}} 6 -high UCMW cold rolling mill. This technology was successfully applied to a 1550 mm tandem cold rolling mill at Baosteel [75 – 78]. This development indicates that the <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> control technology of the 6 -high UCMW cold rolling mill has matured.|$|E

30|$|The {{technology}} of roll profile design and optimization {{has been applied}} early and remains {{an important part of}} related research. The application range of roll profile optimization has expanded from simply improving strip shape to comprehensively controlling strip shape, crown, <b>edge</b> <b>drop,</b> and roll wear. In particular, <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> control by optimizing the roll profile has become a popular research topic.|$|E
30|$|The shape {{standard}} {{curve of the}} first stand of a tandem cold rolling mill was established by Bai, et al. [35] to control strip <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> and keep the rolling process stable. The established curve compensates for {{the influence of the}} strip temperature transverse distribution, increases the bending force, and reduces the strip <b>edge</b> <b>drop.</b> The shape {{standard curve}} model was put forward for the high-strength steel according to the transverse distribution of strip temperature and the requirement of the subsequent processing [36], and the shape quality is improved. The strip shape standard curve in a tandem cold rolling mill was established to compensate for the comprehensive effects of the strip coiling shape variation, fetching machine installation error, strip transverse temperature difference, <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> control, and other factors[37], and both the shape quality and the <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> quality are improved. The possibility of the occurrence of holes and broken strips is reduced by dynamically setting the shape standard curve [38].|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate and document practices currently being used by the Nebraska Department of Roads (NDOR) districts and other State DOTs to mitigate pavement <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> off. The NDOR has developed (or borrowed) and is currently incorporating into its standard practices several procedures that significantly decrease the incidence and magnitude of pavement edge-drop off. As these practices become more fully integrated into highway reconstruction projects, pavement <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> off is expected to decrease dramatically. Localized areas of pavement <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> off along paved lanes with bare or vegetated shoulders were noted as posing particular problems for NDOR maintenance personnel. Several commercial systems for artificially reinforcing soil beneath vegetated or aggregate shoulders were investigated. Suggestions for follow-on research and field studies involving various mitigation procedures are included in the recommendations...|$|E
40|$|For a tree T, let i_T(t) be {{the number}} of {{independent}} sets of size t in T. It is an open question, raised by Alavi, Malde, Schwenk and Erdős, whether the sequence (i_T(t)) _t ≥ 0 is always unimodal. Here we answer the question in the affirmative for some recursively defined families of trees, specifically paths with auxiliary trees dropped from the vertices in a periodic manner. In particular, extending a result of Wang and B. -X. Zhu, we show unimodality of the independent set sequence of a path on 2 n vertices with ℓ_ 1 and ℓ_ 2 pendant <b>edges</b> <b>dropped</b> alternately from the vertices of the path, ℓ_ 1, ℓ_ 2 arbitrary. We also show that the independent set sequence of any tree becomes unimodal if sufficiently many pendant <b>edges</b> are <b>dropped</b> from any single vertex, or if k pendant <b>edges</b> are <b>dropped</b> from every vertex, for sufficiently large k. This in particular implies the unimodality of the independent set sequence of some non-periodic caterpillars. Comment: Some minor corrections. To appear in Australas. J.

40|$|A {{new kind}} of {{numerical}} method, Contact Element Method (CEM) with two relative coordinates, has been proposed. There are two main characteristics in this method. First, meshing {{is based on the}} contact length between the rolls or between the work roll and the strip; second, two relative coordinates are established for every element depending on the contact objects. A matrix for analyzing the rolling process of a Sendzimir mill has been established as well as a software SM 4 SM (Setup Models for Sendzimir Mill) by which the strip <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> during rolling has been studied using the CEM. The calculated results show that the strip <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> will decrease when increasing the 1 st intermediate roll (IMR) taper slope and length, reducing the 1 st IMR shifting, increasing the roll J and the work roll crown, or increasing the tension stress; by contraries, the strip <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> will increase. Meanwhile, three methods (changing the work roll crown, changing the work roll edge rigidity, changing the pressure distribution on the work roll) for controlling the strip <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier B.

30|$|However, most of {{the cold}} rolling mills are 6 -high UCM rolling mills or 4 -high CVC rolling mills. Given that the 4 -high CVC mill has work roll {{shifting}} function, it can use the K-WRS technology to realize similar function of the 6 -high UCMW mill [79]. However, the <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> control capacity of the 6 -high UCM rolling mill is obviously insufficient {{because of the lack}} of work roll shifting function. Sun, et al. [80], adopted a single-side straight-taper work roll profile to enhance the <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> control capacity of the 6 -high UCM rolling mill. He, et al.

Simulation results show that the asymmetrical rolling can reduce the strip <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> dramatically, which is useful in improving the strip shape and reducing the energy cost during cold rolling of thin strip.

40|$|In this paper, the {{mechanics}} of strip edge cracks and its propagation has been studied, {{and the effects of}} strip <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> and stress intensity factor (SIF) on edge crack defections during cold rolling of thin strip have been discussed. An experimental investigation was presented into the effect of strip <b>edge</b> <b>drop</b> on edge cracks during cold rolling of thin strip. The edge crack increases significantly due to more inhomogeneous deformation and work hardening at the strip edge. The effective stress intensity factor range is important as it represents the major physical cause of the crack propagation. The efficiency and reliability of the SIF analytical model has been demonstrated in the study. The proposed method for predicting strip edge crack is helpful in producing defect-free products and providing an understanding of {{the mechanics}} of edge crack propagation in cold rolling of thin strip...|$|E
