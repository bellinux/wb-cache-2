40|$|The {{subject in}} {{of this paper}} is to show {{possible}} ways to optimize pressure force which act on <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> intended for use in motor vehicle clutch. During the exploitation of the clutch, because of friction linings wearing, pressure force which act on the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> is changing. The difference of the acting force when it acts on the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> and new linings, and when it acts on <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> and wear linings (in limits), must be kept in very tight limits. This means that the force in both cases has to be constant. Possible solution to achieve this condition is to have changes in <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> thickens and <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> finger angle, and during those changes the diameter of the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> will stay unchanged. ...|$|R

The effort or load difference is called clutch foot effort hysteresis. It is known that the hysteresis is caused by friction. The frictional force and moment are produced between various component contact points such as between the rubber seal and the inner wall inside the hydraulic cylinder and between the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring</b> and the pressure plate, etc. Understanding the clutch pedal foot effort hysteresis is essential for a clutch release system design and analysis. The dynamic model for a clutch release system is developed for the foot effort hysteresis prediction and a simulation analysis is performed to propose a tool for analysing a clutch system...|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{widespread}} adoption of electronic fuel injection, most carbureted automobile engines used mechanical fuel pumps to transfer fuel from {{the fuel tank}} into the fuel bowls of the carburetor. Most mechanical fuel pumps are diaphragm pumps, which are a type of positive displacement pump. Diaphragm pumps contain a pump chamber whose volume is increased or decreased by the flexing of a flexible diaphragm, similar to the action of a piston pump. A check valve is located at both the inlet and outlet ports of the pump chamber to force the fuel to flow in one direction only. Specific designs vary, but in the most common configuration, these pumps are typically bolted onto the engine block or head, and the engine's camshaft has an extra eccentric lobe that operates a lever on the pump, either directly or via a pushrod, by pulling the diaphragm to bottom dead center. In doing so, the volume inside the pump chamber increased, causing pressure to decrease.This allows fuel to be pushed into the pump from the tank (caused by atmospheric pressure acting on the fuel in the tank). The return motion of the diaphragm to top dead center is accomplished by a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring,</b> during which the fuel in the pump chamber is squeezed through the outlet port and into the carburetor. The pressure at which the fuel is expelled from the pump is thus limited (and therefore regulated) by the force applied by the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>spring.</b>|$|R
