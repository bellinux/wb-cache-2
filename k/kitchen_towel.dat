6000|$|For all {{reply to}} this sally he {{received}} a stare of undisguised amazement from Miss Garland, who then looked across at Mrs. Hudson with a glance which plainly said: [...] "You see he 's quite the insidious personage we feared." [...] The elder lady, however, sat with her {{eyes fixed on the}} ground and her two hands tightly clasped. But touching her Rowland felt much more compassion than resentment; her attitude was not coldness, {{it was a kind of}} dread, almost a terror. She was a small, eager woman, with a pale, troubled face, which added to her apparent age. After looking at her for some minutes Rowland saw that she was still young, and that she must have been a very girlish bride. She had been a pretty one, too, though she probably had looked terribly frightened at the altar. She was very delicately made, and Roderick had come honestly by his physical slimness and elegance. She wore no cap, and her flaxen hair, which was of extraordinary fineness, was smoothed and confined with Puritanic precision. She was excessively shy, and evidently very humble-minded; it was singular to see a woman to whom the experience of life had conveyed so little reassurance as to her own resources or the chances of things turning out well. Rowland began immediately to like her, and to feel impatient to persuade her that there was no harm in him, and that, twenty to one, her son would make her a well-pleased woman yet. He foresaw that she would be easy to persuade, and that a benevolent conversational tone would probably make her pass, fluttering, from distrust into an oppressive extreme of confidence. But he had an indefinable sense that the person who was testing that strong young eyesight of hers in the dim candle-light was less readily beguiled from her mysterious feminine preconceptions. Miss Garland, according to Cecilia's judgment, as Rowland remembered, had not a countenance to inspire a sculptor; but it seemed to Rowland that her countenance might fairly inspire a man who was far from being a sculptor. She was not pretty, as the eye of habit judges prettiness, but when you made the observation you somehow failed to set it down against her, for you had already passed from measuring contours to tracing meanings. In Mary Garland's face there were many possible ones, and they gave you the more to think about that it was not--like Roderick Hudson's, for instance--a quick and mobile face, over which expression flickered like a candle in a wind. They followed each other slowly, distinctly, gravely, sincerely, and you might almost have fancied that, as they came and went, they gave her a sort of pain. She was tall and slender, and had an air of maidenly strength and decision. She had a broad forehead and dark eyebrows, a trifle thicker than those of classic beauties; her gray eye was clear but not brilliant, and her features were perfectly irregular. Her mouth was large, fortunately for the principal grace of her physiognomy was her smile, which displayed itself with magnificent amplitude. Rowland, indeed, had not yet seen her smile, but something assured him that her rigid gravity had a radiant counterpart. She wore a scanty white dress, and had a nameless rustic air which would have led one to speak of her less as a young lady than as a young woman. She was evidently a girl of a great personal force, but she lacked pliancy. She was hemming a <b>kitchen</b> <b>towel</b> with the aid of a large steel thimble. She bent her serious eyes at last on her work again, and let Rowland explain himself.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the presence, degree and nature of microbes hazardous to health, that are contaminating <b>kitchen</b> <b>towels.</b> Nine cotton woven towels were distributed to nine households for use in their normal ways. Microbes were then extracted from towels daily through swabbing, before and after washing the used towels. The swabs were then analysed. Households were also given a questionnaire to indicate the daily application of the towel. A Standard Pour Plate Method with an advantage of counting colony forming units of live microbes only was adopted. Results showed that microbial levels increased with days of usage, from the order of 103 cfu/ml to 105 cfu/ml between second and ninth days, before laundering. Dangerous microbes such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Eschericha ecoli were identified. Laundering could not remove all microbes from the towel. Only the laboratory chemical disinfection removed 100 % microbes.

40|$|When we {{consider}} {{water in the}} cultural context, {{it allows us to}} understand and appreciate its role and importance in the life of people in the present-day civilisation. It is the main element of many family and annual rituals. It pervades the material, social and spiritual aspects of culture with the same intensity in the 21 st century as in the past. Water allows man to move from one space to another and to transgress boundaries without negative consequences for himself and for the environment in which exists. In the past our ancestors used water to propitiate Nature, making also use of their bodies for that purpose, thus creating cultural codes which form cultural sequences connecting the past with the present. The inscription on <b>kitchen</b> <b>towels</b> „Fresh water will make you healthy”, no longer known to the youngest generations in the visual form, still remains actual.

The results showed a total of 125 Enterobacteriaceae spp. isolates, 86 Staphylococcus coagulase-positive isolates, 5 Listeria spp., 13 E. coli isolates and no Campylobacter spp. was found. Most of the isolates were found distributed by the entire house, with handles, knobs and domestic animals' feet being the points more contaminated. Also, there was no relation between the answers to the questionnaires administered and the microbiological results obtained. These results revealed the need to develop some education campaigns designed to educate consumers in good hygiene practices at home...|$|R

40|$|Wet {{strength}} {{is one of}} paper’s most important properties. It can be developed by addition of wet strength additives during the fabrication process. Hereby paper products that require high wet strength, such as <b>kitchen</b> <b>towels</b> and bank note paper, are achieved. This study aims to examine new polymers for future use as wet-strength additive in paper. One of them, a natural biopolymer, has in earlier studies proved to work well as wet strength additive. The objective was to find out in what extent this biopolymer could improve wet strength. A final evaluation was based on mechanical testing of sheets made from bleached Kraft fibres modified by the biopolymer. Wet-strength polymers are used to develop or conserve the mechanical strength of paper when wetted. Wet-strength agents are added in various paper products such as: hand towels, hygiene paper and packaging grades. According to the chemical composition of these agents they can act either as protective agents by preventing fibre swelling and protecting already existing bonds, or they form new and water resistant bonds through reinforcement mechanisms. The natural biopolymer has a structure that {{is very similar to}} the cellulose structure. This fact together with the reactive functions of the biopolymer probably makes it possible to adsorb it to cellulose fibres. Pre-treatments of fibres were done by adding 0. 5 and 2 % biopolymer to the paper pulp. The adsorption was evaluated by measuring the surface charge of pre-treated fibres. This most popular wet-strength today is PAE (poly(aminoamide) - epichlorohydrin)) but it has some drawbacks. PAE makes paper stiffer and decreases the absorption capacity which is useful in packaging products but not in tissue paper. Other drawbacks of PAE are its bad repulpability, degradability and toxic monomers. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

SCA has about 50, 000 employees in some 50 countries. At the beginning of June 2005 two students, Karolina Andersson and Johanna Sahlstedt, began their thesis work at SCA in Mölndal. The path began with the mission to investigate public washrooms to find a visiting frequency for a “high traffic washroom” and based on the investigation define proper size and design criteria for a new series dispensers. After an extensive information-gathering phase all of the information that was found was gathered to get a straight description of the products function. The key was to describe needs and functions without specifying them too much to avoid narrowing the product at that point of the thesis work. The next step along the path was to generate different concepts for evaluation. The concepts advantage and disadvantages were discussed. During concept selection the concept that best satisfied the needs, product specifications and Tork brand values was chosen: HT single. The HT single series is a well-designed and reliable dispenser series. For decades, Tork has pioneered the development of dispensers. Today’s range reduces over-consumption, ensures hygiene, prevents theft and adds to interior design. The basic work of today’s brand Tork is illustrated in the HT single series. The HT single series is designed for high traffic washrooms and will easily cover for 1000 visitor per shift (eight hours). The HT single series consists of: toilet paper dispenser, soap dispenser, hand towel dispenser and waste bin. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
