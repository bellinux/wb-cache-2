5|$|Around 1800, Europeans began {{settling}} the land <b>east</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River that was inhabited by the Chickasaw Indians for centuries {{prior to the}} arrival of Europeans. Chickasaw land in West Tennessee and southwestern Kentucky was ceded in the Jackson Purchase after negotiations in which the United States was represented by General Andrew Jackson and Governor Isaac Shelby, while the Chickasaw were represented by their chiefs and warriors. In 1818, both sides agreed to the transfer by signing the Treaty of Tuscaloosa. In the treaty, the United States agreed to pay the Chickasaw $300,000 in return for the right to the land <b>east</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River and north of the Mississippi state line.|$|E

5|$|As Debbie {{approached}} the northern Gulf Coast, {{it failed to}} intensify, despite warm sea surface temperatures, abundant moisture, and an anticyclone aloft. In addition, the storm never developed good outflow, partially due to stable air related to Tropical Storm Hazel in the eastern Pacific Ocean. After maintaining peak winds for about 12hours, Debbie weakened due to cooler, drier air, deteriorating to a tropical depression on September29. That day, it turned to the northwest, passing just <b>east</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> Delta. On September30, the circulation of Debbie dissipated just offshore Mississippi. Its remnants made landfall, accelerated northeastward, and were eventually absorbed by an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
