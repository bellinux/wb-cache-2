40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> number <b>of</b> <b>falls,</b> {{and balance}} performance {{in women with}} FM and {{to examine the relationship}} between these variables and others, such as balance performance, quality of life, age, pain, and impact of fibromyalgia. Methods. A total of 240 women participated in this cross-sectional study. Of these, 125 had fibromyalgia. Several variables were assessed: age, fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> from 0 to 100, number <b>of</b> <b>falls,</b> body composition, balance performance, lower limb strength, health-related quality of life, and impact of fibromyalgia. Results. Women with fibromyalgia reported more falls and more fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> Fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> was associated with number <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> in the last year, stiffness, perceived balance problems, impact of FM, and HRQoL whereas the number <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> was related to fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> balance performance with eyes closed, pain, tenderness to touch level, anxiety, self-reported balance problems, impact of FM, and HRQoL. Conclusion. FM has an impact on fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> balance performance, and number <b>of</b> <b>falls.</b> Perceived balance problems seem to be more closely associated with fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> than objective balance performance...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{this pilot}} study {{we want to}} {{determine}} how often fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> occurs in geriatric patients visiting a fall clinic and to study the characteristics <b>of</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> and its consequences. DESIGN: Retrospective study of patient's records. METHOD: A random sample of 100 medical records of geriatric patients <b>of</b> the <b>fall</b> clinic <b>of</b> the Jeroen Bosch Ziekenhuis in Den Bosch was systematical examined. RESULTS: The {{mean age of the}} patients was 79. 8 +/- 6 years. Before visiting the fall clinic, the patients had a history <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> during 34. 6 months, and 62 % of them visited a hospital due to the consequences <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> In the fall clinic a mean number of 2. 5 probable causes per fall was diagnosed. In this study 31 % of the patients had fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> The demographic characteristics and the causes <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> <b>of</b> the patients with or without fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> were almost the same. Patients with fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> had a hip prothesis in 26 %, whereas patients without fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> only in 7 % had a hip prothesis (P < 0. 05). In patients with fear <b>of</b> <b>falling,</b> in 90 % extra diagnostic investigation was needed, whereas in patients without fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> extra diagnostic investigation only occurred in 53 % (P < 0. 01). Finally, patients with fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> needed 1. 8 more times physical therapy compared to patients without fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: After a <b>fall,</b> fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> occurs often in geriatric patients. In this study, no causes for fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> could be determinated, although hip prothesis are associated with fear <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> In patients with fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> more medical consumption occurs. In medical practice as in science fear <b>of</b> <b>falling</b> needs more attention...|$|R
