Instead of the 10-kilometer evacuation-zone previously thought to be sufficient to protect inhabitants, a circle of 30 kilometer was proposed as Urgent Protective Action Planning Zones, or UPZ. This definition was {{in line with the}} emergency response requirements proposed by the International Atomic Energy Agency. This draft plan included the <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> within 5 kilometers of plants as precautionary action zones, where residents would immediately evacuate {{in the event of an}} accident. Residents within a radius of about 50 kilometers would be prepared to take immediately action to prevent internal exposure to their thyroid glands by taking iodine tablets. Further studies were planned with experts and municipalities. Implementation of this plan would mean a major review of all anti-nuclear disaster programs by local governments, and it would increase the number of municipalities involved up to around 130, about three times more than the present figure.|$|E

5000|$|The mid-{{elevation}} {{forests in}} the North Cascades with an elevation between 2000 to 4300 ft is the Silver Fir Ecoregion. The Silver Fir Ecoregion makes up {{for much of the}} valleys in the Alpine Lakes area. The average annual temperature in this ecoregion is 42 F and the average precipitation in centimeters is between 220 - 280 cm. Typical montane forests in this ecoregion is dominated by Pacific silver fir and also contains noble fir, Douglas fir, and Alaska yellow-cedar. Coarse woody debris is very characteristic of the Silver Fir Ecoregion, providing microsites for organisms. The Pacific silver fir zone is in some of the steepest parts of the topography and heavy snow often leads to avalanche gullies. In every major drainage basin along the western slopes of the Cascade Mountains there is evidence of avalanche tracks breaking up the forested vegetation with nonforested vegetation. These gullies provide sites of new successional growth as they move toward a coniferous forest again. Because of the dense forests of the Silver Fir Ecoregion, it was the preferred area for commercial logging prior to <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> as wilderness. [...] The Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis) is extremely tolerant of shade and does not fare as well in drought or warmer temperatures. [...] It can grow as high as 180 ft and reach 3 - 5 ft in diameter. The understory communities of the Pacific silver fir can vary depending on moisture availability. Common understory shrubs include the vine maple, salal, Cascade Oregon grape, blueberry, mountain huckleberry, devil's club, and fool's huckleberry. Common understory herbs are bear grass, twin flower, pipsissewa, dwarf dogwood or bunchberry, bead lily, trailing blackberry, low false Solomon’s seal, foam flower, trillium, oak fern, and lady fern. The microclimate of the understory is moderated by the forest canopy causing the conditions to be cooler and moister in the summer and warmer in the winter. Pacific silver fir seedlings and saplings are often found growing under their own canopies or those of a mixed canopy forest. Along streams in this ecoregion, breaks in the forest are replaced by mountain alder, willow and vine maple and herbs such as saxifrage, yellow willow-herb, monkey flowers, and bluebells can be found. Mountain alder and vine maple can also be found around lake edges and in areas of flat or gentle slopes, bogs, or marsh habitat. Examples of Pacific silver fir forests {{can be found in the}} Commonwealth Basin and the Snow Lake areas of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: These {{guidelines}} {{advocate the}} use of sustainable forest management practices to conserve biological diversity on state-owned wildlife management areas (WMAs). Traditional use of WMAs for limited public recreation and wood production {{are consistent with the}} goal of maintaining native biological diversity in Massachusetts. At present, Massachusetts ’ forestlands as a whole lack adequate early- and late-seral forest habitat to meet this goal. Sustainable forestry practices can provide earlyseral forest habitat while addressing increasing societal demands for wood products and biodiversity conservation. Sustainable practices also include <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> for development of late-seral forest conditions. Past human disturbance (e. g., agricultural conversion and/or cutting) has greatly modified tree species composition and simplified vegetation structure on many sites. Forest management on WMAs will focus on creating structurally diverse forest stands, and maintaining a range of seral forest stages across the landscape. Most upland forest will be designated for active management using a combination of even-aged and uneven-aged silviculture. Managers will incorporate elements of natural disturbance patterns into managed forestlands by extending conventional rotation lengths, increasing stand size, retaining clusters of mature trees, and fostering heterogeneity of tree species and size classes on all harvested sites.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze and compare some {{important}} institutional and legal preconditions for wind power development in three Nordic countries: Denmark, Norway and Sweden. In the paper a number of historical, institutional and policy-related differences across these countries are highlighted, but most attention is paid to the various territorial planning procedures. The analysis suggests that although public economic support to wind power is necessary to promote its diffusion in the electricity system, similar policy instruments - in terms of both size and design - can induce significantly different developments depending on the legal preconditions for the location and environmental assessment of windmills. The success and failure stories of technology support policies can thus not easily be transferred across country borders. An important conclusion is that in comparison to Sweden the physical planning systems in both Denmark and Norway provide greater scope for implementing a national wind power policy at the local level. For instance, the Danish planning system is vertically integrated, and involves a <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> for wind power purposes in the local plans, while the municipalities in Sweden must in some way assent to (i. e., plan for) the establishment of windmills at a certain location in order for the installation to actually take place. Compared to its competitors, wind power is one of the power-generating technologies that tend to have the most to lose from the uncertainties created by planning regulations that leave much discretion to local authorities.

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} the general {{background}} context surrounding {{the issue of}} wild land in Scotland. It explores definitions of wild land and related concepts, identifies key issues associated with wild land in Scotland, and explores {{the question of the}} desirability of designating areas as wild land for Scotland. There is increasing interest in the concept of ‘wild land’, ‘wildness’, or ‘wilderness’ in Scotland, other parts of the UK and Europe. Changes in agricultural policy are leading to land abandonment in several European Union member states and in some cases ‘re-wilding’ is taking place with little or no managerial input from humans. These events have led to renewed interest across Europe in setting aside land with minimal management to create ‘wild’ areas. There has been either interest or activity, not always in the public sector, in Italy, Spain, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and the Netherlands in exploring and establishing some form of wild land area. Many of these are relatively small, with evidence of recent human activity, and, as such, are quite distinct from the concept of ‘wilderness’, which has been so influential in certain parts of the world (such as North America) in influencing the <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> of land for minimal management. In contrast there are the large areas of northern Scandinavia, which still contain ‘wilderness-like’ qualities, and to some extent are preserved in the wilderness areas and national parks of Finland, Sweden and Norway. Unfortunately, the terms ‘wild land’, ‘wildness’, ‘wilderness’, come with an enormous amount of associated cultural baggage, resulting in argument and conflict over definitions, purpose, and management of potential wild land or wilderness areas. The aim {{of this paper is to}} unpack some of that baggage and clarify the key issues in the current discussions on wild land taking place in Scotland...|$|E
