5|$|Untreated {{streptococcal pharyngitis}} usually {{resolves}} {{within a few}} days. Treatment with antibiotics shortens {{the duration of the}} acute illness by about 16hours. The primary reason for treatment with antibiotics <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the risk of complications such as rheumatic fever and retropharyngeal abscesses; antibiotics are effective if given within 9 days of the onset of symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Either way, {{many of the}} {{countries}} involved in the crisis are on the euro, so devaluation, individual interest rates, and capital controls are not available. The only solution left to raise a country's level of saving <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits. For example, if a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this would reduce its trade deficit. It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.|$|E
5|$|In human anatomy, a bursa {{is a small}} pouch {{filled with}} {{synovial}} fluid. Its purpose <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> friction between adjacent structures. The prepatellar bursa {{is one of several}} bursae of the knee joint, and is located between the patella and the skin. Prepatellar bursitis is an inflammation of this bursa. Bursae are readily inflamed when irritated, as their walls are very thin. Along with the pes anserine bursa, the prepatellar bursa {{is one of the most}} common bursae to cause knee pain when inflamed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} stage the aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> PD {{symptoms}} while controlling fluctuations in {{the effect of the}} medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed. When oral medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery, deep brain stimulation, subcutaneous waking day apomorphine infusion and enteral dopa pumps can be of use. The third stage presents many challenging problems requiring a variety of treatments for psychiatric symptoms, orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction, etc. In the final stages of the disease, palliative care is provided to improve quality of life.|$|E
5|$|Ongoing {{efforts are}} being made by the {{government}} at various levels (especially of Campania) to reduce the population living in the red zone, by demolishing illegally constructed buildings, establishing a national park around the whole volcano to prevent the future construction of buildings and by offering sufficient financial incentives to people for moving away. One of the underlying goals <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> {{the time needed to}} evacuate the area, over the next 20 or 30years, to two or three days.|$|E
5|$|The Raptor {{has three}} {{internal}} weapons bays: a large bay {{on the bottom}} of the fuselage, and two smaller bays on the sides of the fuselage, aft of the engine intakes. The main bay can accommodate six LAU-142/A launchers for beyond-visual-range missiles and each side bay has an LAU-141/A launcher for short-range missiles. Four of the launchers in the main bay can be replaced with two bomb racks that can each carry one 1,000lb (450kg) or four 250lb (110kg) bombs. Carrying armaments internally maintains the aircraft's stealth and minimizes additional drag. Missile launches require the bay doors to be open for less than a second, during which hydraulic arms push missiles clear of the aircraft; this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> vulnerability to detection and to deploy missiles during high speed flight.|$|E

5|$|The selfish herd {{theory was}} {{proposed}} by W.D. Hamilton {{to explain why}} animals seek central positions in a group. The theory's central idea <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the individual's domain of danger. A domain of danger is the area within the group {{in which the individual}} {{is more likely to be}} attacked by a predator. The center of the group has the lowest domain of danger, so animals will constantly strive to gain this position. Testing Hamilton's selfish herd effect, Alta De Vos and Justin O'Rainn (2010) studied brown fur seal predation from great white sharks. Using decoy seals, the researchers varied the distance between the decoys to produce different domains of danger. The seals with a greater domain of danger had an increased risk of shark attack.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, the player {{controls}} one of a select few characters directly based upon their counterparts in the Naruto anime and manga. Clash of Ninja {{is a member of the}} fighting game genre; the player pits their character against another character controlled by the game's AI or by another player, depending on the mode that the player is in. The objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the opponent's health to zero using basic attacks and special techniques unique to each character that are derived from techniques they use in the Naruto anime or manga. For instance, Naruto Uzumaki is able to use his signature Shadow Clone Technique, and Rock Lee utilizes many of his Strong Fist style techniques. To use these techniques, characters have available a chakra bar, which depletes upon the execution of a special technique, and regenerates over time. In the game's numerous modes, the player can choose from different styles of play. The game's story mode follows the plot from the anime and manga, and a versus mode pitting two players against each other also included.|$|E

5|$|The {{submission}} {{process is}} overseen {{by members of}} the Swedish Music Publishers Association (SMFF), whose task <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the number of songs, which have numbered over 3,000 a year since 2002, to around 1,200. The 3,440 entries received in the preselection for Melodifestivalen 2009 is the most in the competition's history. The SMFF's choices are then given to a sixteen-person jury of music professionals, SVT staff {{and other members of the}} public. The jury ranges from teenagers to people in their fifties. The songs that qualify, along with their composers and lyricists, are announced at the end of September. This is often followed by fervent speculation over who will perform the songs. Songwriters that qualify must provide interviews to SVT, attend a press conference before the competition, and remain open to promotional appearances if their song reaches the final.|$|E
