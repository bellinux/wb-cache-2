An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effects of using different primary tillage implements and soil conditions on draft force, tractor rear wheel slippage, traveling speed, drawbar power, theoretical and effective field capacities, efficiency and fuel consumption rate of a two-wheel drive tractor. High draft, slippage, field efficiencies and fuel consumption rates were recorded in the firm (fallow ridged) soil, while higher traveling speed and theoretical and effective field capacities were obtained for the loose (disc <b>harrowed)</b> <b>soil</b> and the differences were significant at 5 % level. It was found that draft and speed accounted for 76. 9 % and 20 % of the variability in the drawbar power, respectively, while draft and speed jointly accounted for 96. 3 % of the power variability. Chisel plough in loose soil showed the highest power requirement of 8. 77 Kw and the highest theoretical and effective field capacities of 0. 562 ha/h and 0. 443 ha/h, respectively. Moldboard plough under firm soil condition demonstrated the highest draft, slippage and fuel consumption rate of 9. 42 KN, 13. 4 % and 7. 569 1 /h, respectively, with significant differences at 5 % level between the two soils in case of draft and slippage. The highest speed of 4. 85 Km/h and 4. 80 Km/h in loose soil and the highest efficiencies of 82. 3 % and 81. 8 % in the firm soil were obtained by disc and chisel ploughs, respectively.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that tropical soils (mainly Oxisols) have excellent physical characteristics such as high infiltration rates, high permeability of water, good and stable soil structure and that consequently, they can support mechanized agriculture. However in the Eastern Plains (Llanos Orientales) of Colombia, when Oxisols are subjected to tillage using disc <b>harrow,</b> <b>soil</b> physical conditions deteriorate rapidly. We report here that change in land use with deep-rooted tropical pastures can enhance soil quality by improving the size and stability of soil aggregates when compared with soils under monocropping. In addition, rates of water infiltration improved by 5 - 10 -fold while rainfall acceptance capacity improved by 3 - 5 -fold. We suggest that intensive and sustainable use of these Oxisols, could only be possible if an arable or productive layer (i. e. a layer with improved soil physical, chemical and biological properties) is constructed and maintained. One option to achieve this arable layer is {{through the use of}} introduced tropical pastures with deep-rooting abilities that can result in increased soil organic matter and associated improvements in soil physical, chemical and biological properties. One land use option that can achieve these soil improvements is agropastoralism whereby pastures and crops are grown in short-term rotations. Peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is {{determining}} the specific influences which soil tillage and the pre-emerging plant have on the economic efficiency of the soybean culture in the area of the Somesan Plateau. The economic efficiency of the soybean culture is mainly determined by the crop level and the production costs, so that for the soybean culture a profit between 128 - 153 lei/ha is recorded, which varies depending on the soil tillage. Thus, with the classical alternative, a profit of 135 lei/ha is recorded, and with the unconventional chisel and paraplow soil tilling alternatives values of 140 - 153 lei/ha are recorded. The profit achieved in the (a 4) alternative, tilled with the rotary harrow, is 128 lei/ha, smaller than both the profit recorded in the classical system alternatives and the unconventional systems ones. Regardless of the fact that soybean is cultivated after wheat or corn, the profit rate is maximal 16. 25 - 16. 32 % in the paraplow tilling alternative, respectively 13. 57 - 13. 58 % in the classical plowing alternative and 13. 66 - 13. 69 % in the rotary <b>harrow</b> <b>soil</b> tilling alternative.

40|$|Soil is a basic, {{limited and}} non-renewable natural resource. It {{is the natural}} wealth of each country. Therefore, soil erosion {{is a major problem}} not only in the Czech Republic, but also on a global scale. As a result of the erosion process, the {{stability}} of soil aggregates is broken; there appears loss of organic matter and nutrient transport, or land within the property or outside. These factors cause irreversible damage to soils, which ultimately has both environmental and economic impacts. As the wide-rows crops areas increase, including corn there increases even the interest of professionals and the public in that problem. At the present, there are searched new technologies of corn cultivation, which should help in elimination of risks associated with that crop cultivation. The aim of this thesis was to analyze selected soil conservation technologies in corn crops in the company ZD Krasna Hora nad Vltavou in terms of their impact on aquatic soil erosion and biomass production. There were analyzed the technologies of tillage disc <b>harrows</b> <b>soil</b> processing, sowing directly into freezing-out crops and as a control a fallow was established. We have also analyzed two inter-rows spacing of vegetation establishment, namely 37, 5 cm and 75 cm. The results of this work show an evident positive effect of no-tillage technology of corn cultivation, whether in the narrow or wide rows that are particularly effective {{at the beginning of the}} growing season, which is the most problematic for corn. As for the yield of biomass is concerned, the highest yield of biomass was achieved in variants with the width of 75 cm and in technology of sowing into freezing-out crops.

The soil tillage system influenced the humidity along the whole period of vegetation for all culture, showing differences between the classic tillage system (plough), the minimum tillage system (chisel and paraplow) and the rotary harrow tillage. In wheat crop conditions at Romania, {{the order of the}} tillage systems, in what concerns the maximal water reserve at 50 cm depth, was as follows: chisel (3759 m 3 /ha), paraplow system (3651 m 3 /ha), classic plough system (3581 m 3 /ha) and rotary harrow system (3482 m 3 /ha). For wheat crop, in Greece conditions, lower values for humidity in all variants are registered, regardless the soil working system, yet the rotary harrow variant is lowest, because in the first 20 cm depth, in July, humidity (8. 2 - 7. 5 %) reaches values close to the fading index (6. 33 - 6. 78 %).

We investigated microbial community structure {{in a long-term}} field trial (12 -years, Lincoln, New Zealand) established in a silt-loam soil over four depth ranges down to 30 cm. Our objectives were to investigate the degree of homogenisation of soil biological and chemical properties with depth, and to determine the main drivers of microbial community response to tillage. We hypothesised that soil microbiological responses would depend on tillage depth, observed by a homogenisation of microbial community composition within the tilled zone. Tillage treatments were mouldboard plough and disc <b>harrow,</b> impacting <b>soil</b> to ∼ 20 and ∼ 10 cm depth, respectively. These treatments were compared to a no-tillage treatment and two control treatments, both permanent pasture and permanent fallow. Bacterial and fungal communities collected from the site were not impacted by the spatial location of sampling across the study area but were affected by physicochemical changes associated with tillage induced soil homogenisation and plant presence. Tillage treatment effects on both species richness and composition were more evident for bacterial communities than fungal communities, and were greater at depths < 15  cm.

40|$|Until now, most tillage erosion {{experiments}} were conducted under controlled soil and operating conditions. However, soil condition, tillage depth, speed and direction generally show substantial within-field variation.

The effect of a typical tillage sequence, including multiple mouldboard, chisel and <b>harrow</b> passes, on <b>soil</b> translocation and tillage erosion was studied {{during a period of}} 3 years. Soil translocation in excess of 10 m was observed while the average net translocation rates ranged between 0 and 0. 9 m. The results suggest that the annual tillage transport coefficient, associated with mechanized agriculture, is in the order of 781 kg m(- 1) yr(- 1). The experimental results also show that the tillage transport coefficient of a sequence of tillage operations can be reasonably well predicted from information provided by the farmer and by summing the transport coefficients obtained from controlled, single pass experiments. However, a Monte Carlo simulation showed that a relatively high number of tillage operations are required to obtain accurate estimates of the tillage transport coefficients in multiple pass experiments.

40|$|Peat {{is added}} to manure, because its low pH and {{capacity}} to adsorb ammonia (NH 3) give it potential to reduce nitrogen (N) loss. Peat manure was prepared by mixing pig slurry with moderately humified Sphagnum peat. Less than 1 % of applied ammoniacal N was volatilized as NH 3 from peat manure and pig slurry within 8  h of surface application on clay loam soil according to JTI method. Incorporated manures showed even smaller N loss. The low volatilization {{was due to the}} adsorption of manure ammoniacal N by peat, and the infiltration of slurry into <b>harrowed,</b> moist clay <b>soil.</b> In another experiment, peat manure was applied on polypropylene fabric without soil contact. Within the first 3 days there was only 9 % reduction in the ammoniacal N of peat manure, but the major part of it was lost during several weeks of dry and warm weather. Peat manure did not cause any major improvements on the growth and N uptake of spring barley in spring and early summer as compared with slurry. Moisture deficit limited the availability of ammoniacal N of manures. As compared with surface application, incorporation of manures increased nitrification of ammonium in the soil, and dry matter mass (1973 %) and N uptake of barley.

The weight, speed and the angle of the disk harrow were found statistically significant for draft. Also the interactions of three factors were significant. The increasing angle, weight and speed increased the draft. Especially increasing the angle of the disk harrow dramatically increases the draft. The bulk density of the soil was only affected from the angle of the disk harrow. The weight and the speed did not have any effect on bulk density of the soil.

Effects of working depth, seed depth, soil moisture content and working speed on uprooting of Lolium perenne L., Lepidium sativum L. and Chenopodium quinoa Willd. were investigated in laboratory harrowing experiments on a sandy <b>soil.</b> <b>Harrowing</b> uprooted on average 51 % of the emerging plants and 21 % of the plants in the seedling stage. Seventy per cent of all uprooted plants were completely covered by soil. An increase in working depth from 10 mm to 30 mm doubled the average fraction of uprooted plants. Uprooting was also promoted by higher soil moisture contents and higher working speeds. Average uprooting selectivity (=fraction of uprooted emerging plants/fraction of uprooted seedlings of the same species) varied between 2. 0 (deep tillage and high speed) and 5. 6 (dry soil). If tines could keep a distance of more than 3 mm from the crop and weed plants, the average selectivity of all treatments would improve from 2. 4 to 5. 5 and the average fraction of uprooted seedlings would decrease from 21 % to 8 %.

The chronosequence consisted of the following six sites: (i) native field (NF); (ii) PT of the native field (PNF- 1) involving conversion of natural vegetation to cropland; (iii) NT for 10 years (NT- 10); (iv) NT for 20 years (NT- 20); (v) NT for 22 years (NT- 22); and (vi) conventional tillage for 22 years (CT- 22) involving PT with one disking after summer harvest and one after winter harvest to 20 cm depth plus two <b>harrow</b> disking. <b>Soil</b> samples were collected from five depths (0 - 2. 5; 2. 5 - 5; 5 - 10; 10 - 20; and 20 - 40 cm) and SOC, pH (in H(2) O and KCl), Delta pH, potential acidity, exchangeable bases, and cation exchangeable capacity (CEC) were measured. An increase in SOC concentration positively affected the pH, the negative charge and the CEC and negatively impacted potential acidity. Regression analyses indicated a close relationship between the SOC concentration and other parameters measured in this study. The regression fitted between SOC concentration and CEC showed a close relationship. There was an increase in negative charge and CEC with increase in SOC concentration: CEC increased by 0. 37 cmol(c) kg(- 1) for every g of C kg(- 1) soil. The ratio of ECEC:SOC was 0. 23 cmol(c) kg(- 1) for NF and increased to 0. 49 cmol(c) kg(- 1) for NT- 22. The rates of P and K for 0 - 10 cm depth increased by 9. 66 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1) and 17. 93 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1), respectively, with NF as a base line.

Through February and the first half of March, snow fell frequently and quite abundantly so that the ground was covered during a greater part of this time. Several varieties winter-killed quite badly. The Hybrid Lamed was about half dead in the spring. The Hybrid Dattel though not so badly killed as the Lamed, was looking thin and weak. Both of these varieties were weak and backward during the entire season and made a poor crop. The variety “Found in Golnen Cross,” wintered well and looked vigorous from the start. The stand, excepting a few bare spots, was good. April 23 d it stood five inches high, and was harvested July 11 th, at a medium height, free from rust and disease. The berry was medium sized, dark colored, and hard.

The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the impact of intensive disc harrowing (2, 4 or 8 disc harrow passes per year over 3 years) on soil physical and chemical properties, soil phosphorus dynamics, plant growth and nutrient acquisition of contrasting agropastoral systems on an Oxisol. The three main systems tested after 2 years of upland rice cultivation were grass-alone pasture (Brachiaria dictyoneura), green manure (Crotalaria juncea), and maize (Zea mays). Native savanna treatment was used as a control. Intensive disc harrowing improved macroporosity values of 0 – 5 cm soil layer up to 59 % for grass-alone pasture system compared to native savanna. Disc harrowing significantly reduced bulk densities for pasture and green manure systems compared to the native savanna in the 0 – 5 cm soil layer. Intensive disc harrowing significantly improved volumetric moisture content of green manure and maize systems at 5 – 10 cm soil depth. The distribution of biologically, moderately and sparingly available P, organic P and total P varied under green manure, maize and grass-alone pasture systems. Two passes of disc harrow per year were sufficient for grass-alone pasture, while maize showed greater aboveground production and nutrient acquisition at 8 passes of disc harrow per year.

However, quantitative {{estimates of}} seed burial {{are available for}} only a few tools and often without reference to soil structure, moisture or tillage depth. This study proposes a conceptual model for predicting weed seed movements during superficial tillage in response to the type of tool, tillage depth and soil structure. The proposed model was calibrated with field data collected using coloured plastic beads as weed seed proxies. Beads were placed at different vertical and horizontal positions before tillage, using augers to preserve soil structure and collected after tillage by opening trenches and counting beads found at different depths. Approximately 33 % of the beads were retrieved and used to establish bead distributions from which model parameters were estimated. Cross-validation showed that prediction quality was satisfactorily (modelling efficiency = 0. 85, minimum rMSEP = 0. 11) with most of the error associated with using a <b>harrow</b> in compacted <b>soil.</b> Subsequently, the new model was integrated into the existing weed dynamics model FLORSYS, and simulations were run to predict weed emergence and dynamics for different tillage practices. With a surface seed bank, total emergence was highest for shallow operations (harrow, discs) and lowest for deep operations (chisel, mouldboard plough). Emergence was also lower in compacted soils. Differences among tillage tools persisted when weed dynamics were simulated over several years, with mouldboard ploughing generally having the lowest density even though this tool was only used every three years. Superficial tillage which left seeds closest to the soil surface resulted in the highest weed density. Also, for species with heavy seeds densities generally increased with ploughing. These simulations confirm the utility of the new model, but additional studies are needed to examine other tillage, management practices and weed species combinations...|$|R

A second field study also conducted on a Lixisol but only in the stubble field, quantified displacement effects of mouldboard ploughing. The field studies were located 12 km South of Évora, Portugal. Soil displacement or translocation after each tillage operation in both studies was measured using aluminium cubes with a side length of 15 mm as ‘tracers’. Offset angles for the harrow disk were 20 ◦, 44 ◦ and 59 ◦; tractor velocities ranged from 1. 9 to 7. 0 km h− 1 and tillage depth ranged from 4 to 11 cm. The depth of mouldboard ploughing was approximately 40 cm with a wheel speed of 3. 7 km h− 1. The translocation coefficients for the two implements were very different averaging 770 kgm− 1 for the mouldboard plough and ranging from 9 to 333 kgm− 1 for the harrow disk. This shows that the mouldboard plough was more erosive than the harrow disk in these studies. All three variables (soil condition, opening angle, and tillage velocity) were critical factors affecting the translocation coefficient for the harrow disk. Displacement distances were the largest for compacted soils (stubble field), with higher opening or offset angles, and at higher velocities. The results also showed significant correlation for (a) mean soil displacement in the direction of tillage and the slope gradient and (b) soil transport coefficient and the opening angle.

(Publications of the Department of Economic History, School of Economics and Commercial Law, Göteborg university no 89) ISSN 403 - 2864. ISBN 91 - 85196 - 57 - 6. Göteborg 2003 Author: Per Hallén Doctoral Dissertation at the Department of Economic History, Göteborg university. (Written in Swedish with a Summary in English). Distribution: the Department of Economic History, Göteborg university, Box 720, SE- 405 30 Göteborg, Sweden. The main purpose of this thesis was to investigate how much iron the rural population in Sweden possessed 1750 - 1870. The aim was also investigate and to calculate the amount of iron needed to replenish iron stocks lost to each year due to attrition. Many studies of inventories have been conducted in Western Europe and North America however; these studies have primarily focused on luxuries items such as gold, silver and furniture. Iron objects were different, as households did not consider their consumption as a luxury. Households used objects made of iron as coocking pots and other kitchen utensils. On farms the use of iron also increased. During the period 1750 - 1870, iron steadily replaced wooden parts in almost all farm implements, from spades to ploughs and harrows. The transition from wood to iron parts played an important roll as humans gradually took control over the landscape. The new iron tools made digging ditches easier and facilitated large-scale drainage of marches. Iron parts on ploughs and <b>harrows</b> broke the <b>soil</b> faster and deeper than older ones made entirely of wood. Iron tools were not luxuries but they played an important roll in farm economics during the period studied. In the mid 18 th century, an average farm possessed about 150 kilos of iron, in 1870 that had increased to around 500 kilos. During that, time {{the composition of the}} different groups of iron shifted. Iron used in transport and agricultural production became increasingly important. It was in the transport sector that the rise in the possession of iron was first noted as farmers began to use iron tipped wheels and iron axels on wagons and carts. This improvement meant that wagons and carts could load more goods. The second wave of new and improved iron objects included agricultural tools – ploughs and harrows. Some important changes were made already in the late 18 th century, however, the breakthrough of iron implements in agriculture came 1800 - 20. It {{is interesting to note that}} this change was contemporary with a major shift to iron ploughs and harrows in British, Danish and Norwegian farmin...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} three tillage {{implements}} (field cultivator, disk harrow, rotary <b>harrow)</b> on the <b>soil</b> incorporation of various herbicides and consequently on {{the efficacy of}} these herbicides against the weeds and on their selectivity on cotton, was evaluated in four field experiments conducted in Northern Greece during 2003 and 2004. All experimental plots were irrigated with sprinklers, immediately after the pre-emergence application of herbicides, while later all plots were irrigated with either drip irrigation or mobile sprinklers. The herbicide treatments consisted of a broadcast preplant-incorporated (PPI) application of s-metolachlor or trifluralin followed by pre-emergence (PRE) applied prometryn, a pre-emergence 38 cm band application of s-metolachlor + fluometuron and a broadcast PPI application of s-metolachlor followed by post-emergence applied trifloxysulfuron-sodium or pyrithiobac. The PPI application of s-metolachlor or trifluralin followed by PRE application of prometryn resulted the greatest control of redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.). The efficacy of herbicides against common lambsquarters and black nightshade was slightly reduced when they were incorporated into the soil with the rotary harrow. Cotton plant emergence, number of bolls, boll opening and cotton lint yield were not affected in most cases by the tillage implement. Cotton lint yield in plots irrigated with drip irrigation was higher or equal with plots irrigated with sprinklers. The effect of three tillage implements (field cultivator, disk harrow, rotary harrow) and various herbicides was also evaluated in two field experiments conducted in Northern Greece during 2006 and 2007. Herbicide treatments included the pre-plant incorporation of s-metolachlor + fluometuron, trifluralin + fluometuron, ethalfluralin, pendimethalin + fluometuron, fluometuron. Irrigation with sprinklers was not made after cotton sowing. Cotton lint yield in plots treated with preplant incorporated s-metolachlor + fluometuron was equal to plots treated with trifluralin + fluometuron or pendimethalin + fluometuron, but significantly higher than plots treated with ethalfluralin or fluometuron. The incorporation of herbicides in the <b>soil</b> with disk <b>harrow</b> or field cultivator compared to rotary harrow, provided higher efficacy against some weeds and similar effect on cotton plant emergence, number of bolls, bolls opening and cotton lint yield. In addition, the fossil-fuel and labor time requirements of disk harrow and field cultivator were {{lower than that of}} rotary harrow. The findings of this study showed that the herbicides trifluralin, s-metolachlor or pendimethalin in tank mix with fluometuron or prometryn should be used for effective control of broad leaved weeds in cotton. Finally, drip irrigation combined with the PPI application of s-metolachlor or pendimethalin in tank mix with fluometuron and incorporated in the soil with field cultivator or disk harrow should be the first choice of cotton growers in integrated crop management systems. ...|$|R
