40|$|Abstract: This paper firstly {{established}} a three-dimensional modal of <b>gear</b> and <b>rack</b> transmission system. By using {{finite element analysis}} software the model is analyzed and the first six natural frequencies of the <b>gear</b> and <b>rack</b> transmission system are acquired. According to the natural frequencies, actual working speed can be adjusted to avoid resonance. In light of the modal analysis, the transient dynamic finite element model of the <b>gear</b> and <b>rack</b> transmission system is established for the transient dynamic analysis. According to the equivalent stress contour of the <b>gear</b> and <b>rack</b> in contact progress at various times and based on transient dynamic analysis, contact strength and bending strength of the gear are verified and the maximum equivalent stress position is found, providing a theoretical basis for the optimization of the <b>gear</b> and <b>rack...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} cable tie {{consists}} of a flexible nylon tape with an integrated <b>gear</b> <b>rack,</b> and on one end a ratchet within a small open case. Once the pointed tip of the cable tie has been pulled through the case and past the ratchet, it {{is prevented from being}} pulled back; the resulting loop may only be pulled tighter. This allows several cables to be bound together into a cable bundle and/or to form a cable tree.|$|E

The trunnion bascule has two bridge leaves with pivots on the opposing riverbanks and are raised on large trunnion bearings by large counterweights which offset {{the weight of}} the leaves. They take their names from the French word Bascule meaning seesaw and the counterweights.

50|$|The photo {{shows the}} {{internal}} mechanism. The L-shaped handle has a <b>gear</b> <b>rack,</b> which spins the white step-up gear, {{which in turn}} spins the flywheel on which is mounted the dark grey magnet, seen on the lower left. The magnet induces an electric current in the red copper winding, seen on the lower right. The current from the copper winding flows through the filament of an incandescent light bulb (not shown), giving off light. A spring and ratchet returns the handle to its original position after each engagement.|$|E

5000|$|George Chinn {{notes about}} the 1907 model that: [...] "While it was gas {{actuated}} {{by means of}} a piston, the French reversed the conventional principle. Instead of the piston thrust rearward furnishing the source of energy to operate the piece, the gas propels the piston forward to unlock the bolt. The piston is attached by a spring-loaded rod to a <b>gear</b> <b>rack.</b> This in turn engages a spur gear which is fastened to an actuating lever. When the lever is in the forward horizontal position and engages a cam slot in the bolt, the gun is locked. Upon firing, the gas drives the piston forward, compressing the spring and causing the spur gear to rotate clockwise. The actuating lever turns with the gear for a half revolution, retracting the bolt and stopping at the rear horizontal position. The driving spring then forces the piston rearward, which reverses the action and returns the bolt to battery." ...|$|E
5000|$|The lever escapement, {{invented by}} Thomas Mudge in 1750, {{has been used}} in the vast {{majority}} of watches since the 19th century. Its advantages are (1) it is a [...] "detached" [...] escapement; unlike the cylinder or duplex escapements the balance wheel is only in contact with the lever during the short impulse period when it swings through its centre position and swings freely the rest of its cycle, increasing accuracy, and (2) it is a self-starting escapement, so if the watch is shaken so that the balance wheel stops, it will automatically start again. The original form was the rack lever escapement, in which the lever and the balance wheel were always in contact via a <b>gear</b> <b>rack</b> on the lever. Later, it was realized that all the teeth from the gears could be removed except one, and this created the detached lever escapement. British watchmakers used the English detached lever, in which the lever was at right angles to the balance wheel. Later Swiss and American manufacturers used the inline lever, in which the lever is inline between the balance wheel and the escape wheel; this is the form used in modern watches. In 1867 Georges Frederic Roskopf invented an inexpensive, less accurate form called the Roskopf or pin-pallet escapement, which was used in cheap [...] "dollar watches" [...] in the early 20th century and is still used in cheap alarm clocks and kitchen timers.|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} at the AneCom AeroTest facility in Wildau, Germany {{to determine the effects}} of inlet total pressure distortions, representative of those expected for an inlet to a supersonic business jet, on fan performance. A Rolls-Royce fan, similar to one that would be used for a supersonic business jet engine, was tested with several different inlet total pressure distortions. The distortions were designed to capture the effects of an inlet cone, struts associated with the cone, endwall boundary layers, and wind gusts. Following industry best practice procedures, the change in performance and inlet flow characteristics are described based on the Society of Automotive Engineer (SAE) documents: AIR- 1419 and ARP- 1420. The fan was found to be very sensitive to tip radial distortion, where alteration of the flow condition at the tip was seen to either enhance or deteriorate the fan stability, especially when the fan instability is rotating stall or surge. Circumferential distortion was found to have the most impact when the fan instability is flutter. Using correlation method recommended by SAE, radial distortion was successfully correlated to surge margin loss. ^ Additionally, lessons learned from wire-gauze screen design work done at the Purdue Compressor/Pre-Diffuser/Combustor (CPC) Research facility were documented. The single stage facility models the last stage of a high pressure compressor, and to create the proper inlet flow, multiple screens with partial spanwise coverage were used. The effect of changing screen porosity, screen spanwise coverage, and the addition or removal of <b>gear</b> <b>rack</b> (blockage generator) at the tip and hub to the inlet total pressure profile was documented. ...|$|E

40|$|In this study, a new {{antibacklash}} {{gear mechanism}} design comprising three pinions and a rack is introduced. This mechanism offers several advantages compared to conventional antibacklash mechanisms, such as lower transmission error {{as well as}} lower required preload. Nonlinear dynamic modeling of this mechanism is developed to acquire insight into its dynamic behavior. It is observed {{that the amount of}} preload required to diminish the backlash depends on the applied input torque and nature of periodic mesh stiffness. Then, an attempt is made to obtain an approximate relation to find the minimum requiring preload to preserve the system's antibacklash property and reduce friction and wear on the gear teeth. The mesh stiffness of the mated <b>gears,</b> <b>rack,</b> and pinion is achieved via finite element method. Assuming that all teeth are rigid and static transmission error is negligible, dynamic transmission error (DTE) would be zero for every input torque, which is a unique trait, not yet proposed in previous research...|$|R

50|$|Thermoforming {{has benefited}} from {{applications}} of engineering technology3, although the basic forming process {{is very similar to}} what was invented many years ago. Microprocessor and computer controls on more modern machinery allow for greatly increased process control and repeatability of same-job setups from one production run with the ability to save oven heater and process timing settings between jobs. The ability to place formed sheet into an inline trim station for more precise trim registration has been hugely improved due to the common use of electric servo motors for chain indexing versus air cylinders, <b>gear</b> <b>racks,</b> and clutches on older machines. Electric servo motors are also used on some modern and more sophisticated forming machines for actuation of the machine platens where form and trim tooling are mounted, rather than air cylinders which have traditionally been the industry standard, giving more precise control over closing and opening speeds and timing of the tooling. Quartz and radiant-panel oven heaters generally provide more precise and thorough sheet heating over older cal-rod type heaters, and better allow for zoning of ovens into areas of adjustable heat..|$|R
