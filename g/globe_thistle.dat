40|$|Remarkably, {{within the}} Asteraceae, a species-specific fructan pattern can be observed. Some {{species such as}} {{artichoke}} (Cynara scolymus) and <b>globe</b> <b>thistle</b> (Echinops ritro) store fructans with a considerably higher degree of polymerization than the one observed in chicory (Cichorium intybus) and Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus). Fructan:fructan 1 -fructosyltransferase (1 -FFT) is the enzyme responsible for chain elongation of inulin-type fructans. 1 -FFTs were purified from chicory and <b>globe</b> <b>thistle.</b> A comparison revealed that chicory 1 -FFT has a high affinity for sucrose (Suc), fructose (Fru), and 1 -kestose as acceptor substrate. This makes redistribution of Fru moieties from large to small fructans very likely {{during the period of}} active fructan synthesis in the root when import and concentration of Suc can be expected to be high. In <b>globe</b> <b>thistle,</b> this problem is avoided by the very low affinity of 1 -FFT for Suc, Fru, and 1 -kestose and the higher affinity for inulin as acceptor substrate. Therefore, the 1 -kestose formed by Suc:Suc 1 -fructosyltransferase is preferentially used for elongation of inulin molecules, explaining why inulins with a much higher degree of polymerization accumulate in roots of <b>globe</b> <b>thistle.</b> Inulin patterns obtained in vitro from 1 -kestose and the purified 1 -FFTs from both species closely resemble the in vivo inulin patterns. Therefore, we conclude that the species-specific fructan pattern within the Asteraceae {{can be explained by the}} different characteristics of their respective 1 -FFTs. Although 1 -FFT and bacterial levansucrases clearly differ in their ability to use Suc as a donor substrate, a kinetic analysis suggests that 1 -FFT also works via a ping-pong mechanism. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Inulin- type fructans {{are stored}} in the {{tuberous}} roots of the Brazilian cerrado plant Viguiera discolor Baker (Asteraceae). In Cynara scolymus (artichoke) and Echinops ritro (<b>globe</b> <b>thistle),</b> the fructans have a considerably higher degree of polymerization (DP) than in Cichorium intybus (chicory) and Helianthus tuberosus (Jerusalem artichoke). It was shown before that the higher DP in some species {{can be attributed to}} the properties of their fructan: fructan 1 - fructosyl transferases (1 - FFTs; EC 2. 4. 1. 100), enzymes responsible for chain elongation. Here, we describe the cloning of a high DP (hDP) 1 - FFT cDNA from V. discolor and its heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris. Starting from 1 - kestose and Neosugar P (a mixture of oligo- inulins from microbial origin) as substrates, the recombinant enzyme produces a typical hDP inulin profile in vitro, closely resembling the one observed in vivo. The enzyme shows no invertase activity and sucrose: sucrose 1 - fructosyl transferase (1 - SST; EC 2. 4. 1. 99) activity in vitro. Pattern evolution during incubation suggests that inulins with DP >= 6 are much better substrates than sucrose or lower DP oligo- fructans. Because hDP inulin- type fructans show superior properties for specific food and non- food applications, the hDP 1 - FFT gene from V. discolor has potential for the production of hDP inulin in vitro or in transgenic crops. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Inulin-type fructans are the {{simplest}} and most studied fructans and have become increasingly popular as prebiotic health-improving compounds. A natural variation {{in the degree of}} polymerization (DP) of inulins is observed within the family of the Asteraceae. <b>Globe</b> <b>thistle</b> (Echinops ritro), artichoke (Cynara scolymus), and Viguiera discolor biosynthesize fructans with a considerably higher DP than Cichorium intybus (chicory), Helianthus tuberosus (Jerusalem artichoke), and Dahlia variabilis. The higher DP in some species {{can be explained by the}} presence of special fructan:fructan 1 -fructosyl transferases (high DP 1 -FFTs), different from the classical low DP 1 -FFTs. Here, the RT-PCR-based cloning of a high DP 1 -FFT cDNA from Echinops ritro is described, starting from peptide sequence information derived from the purified native high DP 1 -FFT enzyme. The cDNA was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris. A comparison is made between the mass fingerprints of the native, heterodimeric enzyme and its recombinant, monomeric counterpart (mass fingerprints and kinetical analysis) showing that they have very similar properties. The recombinant enzyme is a functional 1 -FFT lacking invertase and 1 -SST activities, but shows a small intrinsic 1 -FEH activity. The enzyme is capable of producing a high DP inulin pattern in vitro, similar to the one observed in vivo. Depending on conditions, the enzyme is able to produce fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) as well. Therefore, the enzyme might be suitable for both FOS and high DP inulin production in bioreactors. Alternatively, introduction of the high DP 1 -FFT gene in chicory, a crop widely used for inulin extraction, could lead to an increase in DP which is useful for a number of specific industrial applications. 1 -FFT expression analysis correlates well with high DP fructan accumulation in vivo, suggesting that the enzyme is responsible for high DP fructan formation in planta. status: publishe...|$|E
