5|$|Opening with a {{night time}} {{view of a}} high rise {{apartment}} block, the music video sees the group singing and dancing from the block's rooftop. A couple are shown arguing {{in one of the}} apartments while the group appear invisible beside them. The couple throw clothes and pillows at each other, among other things. Their aggressive behaviour is frozen each time while the group serenade them. The girlfriend later sits <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> cries before the video ends with frozen shots of the group in a now-empty apartment.|$|E
5|$|Without a role or rank, Kulikovsky brooded in Denmark, {{becoming}} moody and listless. A spinal injury sustained {{during the}} war, {{for which he}} had to wear a corset, remained unhealed. In 1925, Kulikovsky accompanied his wife to a Berlin nursing home to meet Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Olga's niece, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. According to Harriet von Rathlef, who witnessed the meeting, while Olga and Anderson conversed, he sat <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> sulked. Although Olga felt sympathy for Anderson, if only because she was ill, she eventually denounced her as an impostor. Possibly, she was pressured to do so by Kulikovsky and Dowager Empress Marie.|$|E
25|$|Evans' {{career began}} {{just before the}} rock {{explosion}} in the 1960s. During this decade, jazz was swept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner,</b> <b>and</b> most new talents had few opportunities to gain recognition, especially in America. However, Evans believed he had been lucky to gain some exposure before this profound change in the music world, and never had problems finding employers and recording opportunities.|$|E

25|$|The janus is {{the only}} piece in this game which is able to checkmate the opponent's king without the {{assistance}} of any other piece, if the king is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> the janus is two squares away on a diagonal, but this checkmate cannot be forced. This chess variant has been popular {{in places such as}} Europe. Several chess grandmasters have played this game including Viktor Korchnoi, Péter Lékó and Artur Yusupov.|$|E
500|$|According to Lionel Steketee, [...] "Mylène [...] very professional, thorough, {{discreet}} {{and almost}} shy" [...] when she {{participated in the}} shooting of the video. He {{said she had to}} be careful not to get scratched by the cat, and that the final scene was difficult to film because the cats were afraid of the water used in this scene, the rats remained hidden <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> the birds did not fly much. Given that the song deals with the pain caused by the absence of a dead person, the video is unrelated to the lyrics, as noted by author Alice Novak. In reviews, Yahoo! Music said that, through the video, [...] " [...] invites us into her dark and magical universe", and Premiere deemed it [...] "mysterious, provocative". Considering it a short film, Cachin praised the music video as being [...] "perfectly done".|$|E
500|$|Michael Azerrad {{argued in}} his Nirvana {{biography}} [...] (1993) that Nevermind marked an epochal generational shift in music {{similar to the}} rock-and-roll explosion in the 1950s {{and the end of}} the baby boomer generation's dominance of the musical landscape. Azerrad wrote, [...] "Nevermind came along at exactly the right time. This was music by, for, and about a whole new group of young people who had been overlooked, ignored, or condescended to." [...] In its citation placing it at number 17 in its 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, Rolling Stone said, [...] "No album in recent history had such an overpowering impact on a generation—a nation of teens suddenly turned punk—and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator." [...] Gary Gersh, who signed Nirvana to Geffen Records, added that [...] "There is a pre-Nirvana and post-Nirvana record business...'Nevermind' showed that this wasn't some alternative thing happening off <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner,</b> <b>and</b> then back to reality. This is reality." ...|$|E

500|$|At an {{official}} {{press conference on}} April 14, 2009 in New York, {{it was announced that}} Cotto would be defending his title against Ghanaian boxer Joshua Clottey, in a fight that was originally intended to be an unification that also included the International Boxing Federation's title on June 13, 2009. An attendance of 17,734 packed Madison Square Garden in New York City. In the first round Cotto scored a knockdown after connecting a jab. In the third round an accidental head clash opened a severe laceration over Cotto's left eye. The injury bled profusely during the fourth round, but he was able to control the pace. In the fifth round, Clottey was pushed to the floor during an exchange and was injured in his left knee, receiving time to recover before the contest resumed. In the sixth, Cotto trapped Clottey <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> gained offensive advantage. During the next two rounds, Clottey controlled the offensive, noticing that Cotto was unable to see right punches. During the last rounds, Cotto decided to employ his technique from outside, while the fight's tempo remained close. The judges decided the fight's outcome by split decision, awarding scores of 115-112 and 116-111 for Cotto and 114-113 for Clottey. When the scorecards were read, Clottey shouted, [...] "Oh no! This can't happen", then went over to Bob Arum and said, [...] "That's it, I quit, I'm done with boxing. I can't take it anymore." [...] Arum said he thought it was 'a magnificent fight and you have to continue.' ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the group}} arrived in California, Nirvana {{did a few}} days of {{pre-production}} where the band and Vig tightened up some of the song arrangements. The only recording carried over from the Smart Studios sessions was the song [...] "Polly", which included cymbal crashes performed by Chad Channing. Once recording commenced, the band worked eight to ten hours a day. The band members tended to take two or three tries at instrumental takes; if the takes were not satisfactory at that point, they would move on to something else. The group had rehearsed the songs so much before recording started that often only a few takes were needed. Cobain used a variety of guitars, from Stratocasters to Jaguars, and Novoselic used a black 1979 and natural 1976 Gibson Ripper. Novoselic and Grohl finished their bass and drum tracks in a matter of days, but Cobain had to work longer on guitar overdubs, singing, and particularly lyrics (which sometimes were finished mere minutes before recording). Cobain's phrasing was so consistent on various takes that Vig would mix the takes together to create overdubs. Vig says that he often had to trick Cobain into recording additional takes for overdubs since the singer was averse to performing multiple takes. In particular, Vig convinced Cobain to double-track his vocals on the song [...] "In Bloom" [...] by telling him [...] "John Lennon did it." [...] While the sessions went well generally, Vig said Cobain would become moody and difficult at times: [...] "He'd be great for an hour, and then he'd sit <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> say nothing for an hour." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite these problems, Fernando {{remained}} an accessible and popular celebrity, known for signing many autographs. After his knockout win over Fitz Vanderpool on July 26, 2003, he stood <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> yelled [...] "I love you guys!" [...] to his fans. Vargas continued his comeback, on December 12, with a seventh round knockout of Tony Marshall that was shown live nationwide from Tucson, on Telemundo. During that fight, Vargas injured a disc in his back, and his doctor recommended surgery, but Vargas chose to rehabilitate his back himself {{without having the}} procedure. This caused him to spend almost two years in inactivity, but, on March 26, 2005 he returned to boxing with a ten round unanimous decision win over Ray Joval in Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|E

2500|$|Red {{started work}} on their second album, Innocence & Instinct, shortly after they had {{completed}} End of Silence. In January 2008, they began a six-week period rehearsing and laying down drum tracks so they could continue recording while on tour. Graves joined the group {{on the road and}} assembled a studio at the back of their tour bus. They would assemble hotel mattresses <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> record vocals in the enclosed space. Recording took place at Little Big Sound, The Graveyard, and Paragon Studios in Tennessee. and Their website issued a statement explaining the album [...] "was forged from a storm of inspiration and catastrophe", and later revealed Dante's Inferno and artwork by Gustave Doré as inspirations behind the music. They halted its progress to headline a nationwide club tour in March 2008, their first without a restrictive time slot which allowed them to develop their stage performance.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the year}} 1589, {{when she was}} 4 years old, she entered the Dominican convent of her {{hometown}} (San Sebastian), with her sisters Isabel and Maria. Erauso's mother's cousi,n Ursula de Uriza and Sarasti, held the position of prioress in the convent. It was normal at that time for girls {{to be placed in}} convents at a young age to be educated according to Catholic tradition, promoting the learning of tasks appropriate to their sex to be subsequently to be betrothed [...] "as God intended". Because of her explosive character and the difficulty the nuns faced to control her, she was transferred to the Convent of San Bartolome de San Sebastian until she was 15, where the rules were much stricter. She realized that she had no religious vocation, and as a result she felt imprisoned and refused to take her vows. Catalina de Erauso was detained in her cell because of the constant fights she had with a widowed novice named Catalina de Alirli. For this reason, on the night of March 18, 1600, the eve of San Jose, she found the keys of the convent hanging <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> used them to escape. She fabricated men's clothing with the materials at her disposal, cut her hair and hid her habit.|$|E
2500|$|Benny {{also was}} caricatured in several Warner Brothers {{cartoons}} including Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur (1939, as Casper the Caveman), I Love to Singa, Slap Happy Pappy, and Goofy Groceries (1936, 1940, and 1941 respectively, as Jack Bunny), Malibu Beach Party (1940, as himself), and The Mouse that Jack Built (1959). The last {{of these is}} probably the most memorable: Robert McKimson engaged Benny and his actual cast (Mary Livingstone, Eddie Anderson, and Don Wilson) to do the voices for the mouse versions of their characters, with Mel Blanc—the usual Warner Brothers cartoon voicemeister—reprising his old vocal turn as the always-aging Maxwell, always a phat-phat-bang! away from collapse. In the cartoon, Benny and Livingstone agree to spend their anniversary at the Kit-Kat Club, which they discover the hard way is inside the mouth of a live cat. Before the cat can devour the mice, Benny himself awakens from his dream, then shakes his head, smiles wryly, and mutters, [...] "Imagine, me and Mary as little mice." [...] Then, he glances toward the cat lying on a throw rug <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>and</b> sees his and Livingstone's cartoon alter egos scampering out of the cat's mouth. The cartoon ends with a classic Benny look of befuddlement. It was rumored that Benny requested that, in lieu of monetary compensation, he receive a copy of the finished film.|$|E
