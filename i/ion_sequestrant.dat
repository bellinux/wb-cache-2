A selection of complexes were screened, in vitro, for growth inhibition activity against a range of fungal and bacterial pathogens and were found to have broad spectrum activity. The most active complexes were then tested, in vivo, for cytotoxicity and antifungal activity using the Galleria mellonella insect model. Healthy G. mellonella larvae appeared to be unaffected by the complexes at concentrations up to 500 μg/cm 3. The most active complex, [Mn 2 (ƞ 1 ƞ 1 μ 2 -oda) (phen) 4 (H 2 O) 2][Mn 2 (ƞ 1 ƞ 1 μ 2 -oda) (phen) 4 (ƞ 1 -oda) 2]. 4 H 2 O (13), increased the survival rate of larvae administered with a lethal dose of C. albicans and was much more efficacious than the clinically used antifungal drug, ketoconazole. Against two different Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, the Mn(II) complexes exhibited potent antimycobacterial activity, with 13 being 3 -fold more active than the prescription drug, isoniazid. This Mn(II) complex was also highly cytotoxic towards other bacterial cells. The Cu(II) bis-imidazo-phenanthroline complexes proved to be effective nuclease mimetic agents. In particular, a heteronuclear, ferrocene-appended imidazo-phenanthroline Cu(II) complex, displayed potent DNA scission activity and retained this activity {{in the presence of a}} large excess of the powerful metal <b>ion</b> <b>sequestrant,</b> EDTA. Cu(II) -based complexes were generally the most effective anticancer agents (in vitro), and [Cu 2 (oda) (phen) 4](ClO 4) 2. 2. 76 H 2 O. EtOH (14) was particularly cytotoxic towards the cancerous A 549 alveolar cell line...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported {{the preparation of}} the genipin cross-linked alginate-chitosan (GCAC) microcapsules composed of an alginate core with a genipin cross-linked chitosan membrane. This paper is the further investigation on their structural and physical characteristics. Results showed that the GCAC microcapsules had a smooth and dense surface and a networked interior. Cross-linking by genipin substantially reduced swelling and physical disintegration of microcapsules induced by nongelling <b>ions</b> and calcium <b>sequestrants.</b> Strong resistance to mechanical shear forces and enzymatic degradation was observed. Furthermore, the GCAC membranes were permeable to bovine serum albumin and maintained a molecular weight cutoff at 70 KD, analogous to the widely studied alginate-chitosan, and alginate-poly-L-lysine-alginate microcapsules. The release features and the tolerance of the GCAC microcapsules in the stimulated gastrointestinal environment were also investigated. This GCAC microcapsule formulation offers significant potential as a delivery vehicle for many biomedical applications...|$|R
