40|$|Microfabricated {{capillary}} array <b>electro-phoresis</b> (µCAE) {{microchannel plates}} are {{the next generation}} of bioanalytical separation devices. To fully exploit the capabilities of µCAE devices, supporting technology such as robotic sample loading, gel loading, mi-croplate washing, and data analysis must be developed. Here, we describe a device for loading gel into radial capillary array elec-trophoresis microplates and for plate wash-ing and drying. The microplates are locked into a loading module, and high-pressure he-lium is used to drive aqueous separation me-dia or wash solutions into the microchannels through fixtures connected to the central an-ode reservoir.

40|$|Background. The current {{method for}} cell line {{authentication}} is genotyping based on short tandem repeat (STR) –PCR involving coampli-fication of {{a panel of}} STR loci by multiplex PCR and downstream fragment length analysis (FLA), usually performed by capillary <b>electro-phoresis.</b> FLA by capillary electrophoresis is time-consuming and can be expensive, as the facilities are generally not accessible for many research laboratories. Methods. In the present study, a microfluidic electrophoresis system, the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, was {{used to analyze the}} STR-PCR fragments from 10 human genomic loci of a number of human cell lines, including 6 gliomas, 1 astrocyte, 1 primary lung cancer, 1 lung brain metastatic cancer, and 1 rhabdomyosarcoma; and this was compared with the standard method, that is, capillary <b>electro-phoresis,</b> using the Applied Biosystems 3130 xl Genetic Analyzer. Results. The microfluidic electrophoresis method produced highly reproducible results with good sensitivity in sizing of multiple PCR frag-ments, and each cell line demonstrated a unique DNA profile. Furthermore, DNA fingerprinting of samples from 5 different passage numbers of the same cell line showed excellent reproducibility when FLA was performed with the Bioanalyzer, indicating that no cross-contamination had occurred during the culture period. Conclusion. This novel application provides a straightforward and cost-effective alternative to STR-based cell line authentication.

40|$|To whom reprint {{requests}} {{should be sent}} The resistant hepatocyte model was used to study expression of tumor-associated aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activi-ty {{during the course of}} rat hepatocarcinogenesis. The hepatic ALDH phenotype was determined at intervals over 280 days by histochemical analysis, total ALDH activity assays and gel electrophoresis, using propionaldehyde and NAD (P/NAD) to characterize normal liver ALDH activity or benzaldehyde and NADP (B/NADP) to determine tumor-associated ALDH activity. By total activity assays and gel <b>electro-phoresis,</b> no significant changes in ALDH activity occurred until day 70. However, histochemical analysis clearly demon-strated changes in ALDH activity early in neoplastic develop-ment. Intense focal hepatocyte staining with P/NAD and/or B/NADP was first detectable at day 28. The number of P/NAD-positive foci increased until day 35 then declined un-til day 70. The number of B/NADP-positive foci also increas-ed until day 35, but then remained relatively constant {{for the remainder of the}} experiment. GGT activity of serial sections indicated that early ALDH-positive lesions represent a small subpopulation (9 %) of all GGT-positive foci. However, by day 168 a significant portion (80 %) of persistent GGT-positive neoplastic nodules were also B/NADP-positive histochemically. In addition, virtually all hepatocellular car-cinomas (96 %) generated by this protocol possessed signifi-cantly elevated levels of tumor-associated ALDH by histo-chemical analysis, total ALDH activity and gel <b>electro-phoresis.</b> These results indicate that early appearing ALDH-positive lesions may define one early subpopulation of all in-itiated cells that have a high probability of progressing to the ultimate neoplasm...|$|E
