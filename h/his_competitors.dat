5|$|Leto {{participated in}} the World Cyber Games 2004 in San Francisco. In {{preparation}} for the World Cyber games, Zyos traveled for the two weeks prior to practice playing against <b>his</b> <b>competitors.</b> At the opening ceremony of the games, Leto was player representative, having been the previous year's champion, and called on players to have good sportsmanship. In the final game, Leto led early 135, but his opponent rallied to 1310 before Zyos was able to also rally and defeat him.|$|E
5|$|By late 2004, Brokaw {{had retired}} from his {{anchoring}} duties at NBC, ceding the reins to Brian Williams; Rather planned {{to step down}} in March 2005. Jennings and ABC saw an opportunity to gain viewers, and initiated a publicity blitz touting the anchor's foreign reporting experience. However, despite having almost always reported {{from the scene of}} any major news story, Jennings was sidelined by an upper respiratory infection in late December 2004; he was forced to anchor from New York during the aftermath of the Asian tsunami, while <b>his</b> <b>competitors</b> traveled to the region. For Jennings, the situation was agonizing.|$|E
5|$|Finnish speed skater Clas Thunberg {{topped the}} medal count with five medals: three golds, one silver, and one bronze. One of <b>his</b> <b>competitors,</b> Roald Larsen of Norway, also won five medals, with two silver and three bronze medal-winning performances. The first gold {{medalist}} at these Games—and therefore the first gold medalist in Winter Olympic history—was American speed skater Charles Jewtraw. Only one medal change took {{place after the}} Games: in the ski jump competition, a marking error deprived American athlete Anders Haugen of a bronze medal. Haugen pursued {{an appeal to the}} IOC many years after the fact; he was awarded the medal after a 1974 decision in his favor.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Australia {{won their}} first two gold medals, the first time any {{southern}} hemisphere country had won an event. Australia's maiden gold came in highly unlikely circumstances. Steven Bradbury, {{a member of the}} bronze-winning 1994 relay team, won gold in short track speed skating on 17 February when all of <b>his</b> <b>competitors</b> in the 1,000m final crashed out on the final turn while jostling for the medal positions. He had qualified for the final after benefiting from similar incidents and disqualifications in the quarter and semifinals. Bradbury came third in his quarterfinal and would have been eliminated, but world champion Marc Gagnon was disqualified for obstruction and the Australian progressed.|$|E
5|$|The Godesburg {{foundation}} {{stone was}} laid on 15 October 1210 upon {{the order of}} Dietrich of Hengebach, the Archbishop of Cologne, who was himself in disputed possession of the Electorate and fighting to keep his position. Although <b>his</b> <b>competitors</b> deposed Dietrich in 1212, his successors finished and enlarged the fortress; it featured in chronicles of the subsequent centuries as both a symbolic and physical embodiment {{of the power of}} the archbishop of Cologne in his many struggles for regional authority in secular and ecclesiastical matters. Furthermore, by the late 14th century, the fortress had become the repository of the Elector's valuables and archives. By the mid-16th century, with the inclusion of residential facilities, the castle was popularly considered the Lieblingssitz, or the favorite seat (home), of the Electors.|$|E
5|$|In 1549, Day {{opened a}} new shop in Cheapside, and the next year, he and Seres were {{successful}} enough to amicably separate their businesses. Day set up his new home and printing establishment at Aldersgate in the parish of St Anne and St Agnes and transferred from the Stringers' to the Stationers' Company. Day found Aldersgate's foreigner-friendly attributes helpful in attracting skilled Dutch workers, whom he relied on throughout his career. He soon {{established himself as a}} quality printer, and in 1551, he reprinted an elaborate edition of the Bible that he had previously produced with Seres. The next year, he secured a valuable patent to print the works of John Ponet and Thomas Beccon. This enraged one of <b>his</b> <b>competitors,</b> Reginald Wolfe, who already held a patent to print Ponet's Catechism in Latin. Eventually, a compromise patent was issued which allowed Wolfe to continue printing the Catechism in Latin and Day to print the work in English. Day reaped more benefits from the deal than Wolfe: the English printings were used far more extensively than the Latin ones, and the ABC was eventually appended with Ponet's Catechism.|$|E

5|$|The {{motorcycle}} {{technology of}} the late 1970s featured engines with power in excess of what the frames and tires of the day could accommodate. Roberts' riding style, bred on the dirt tracks of America, revolutionized road racing. Prior to his arrival in Europe, riders focused on attaining high entry speeds into corners, leaving braking until the last possible moment then, carving graceful arcs through the corners with both wheels in line. Roberts did just the opposite, braking early then, quickly applying the throttle {{which resulted in the}} rear tire breaking traction and spinning. The resulting tire spin caused the motorcycle to buck and shake as it continually lost then regained traction, creating a brutal, violent riding style that no one had ever seen before on the racetracks of Europe. His riding style was reminiscent of dirt track riding, where sliding the rear tire to one side is used as a method to steer the motorcycle around a corner. Because of his early application of the throttle, he was able to attain top speed faster than <b>his</b> <b>competitors.</b>|$|E
5|$|The sixteenth leg was a {{downhill}} stage from the Swiss Alps. A breakaway did form but was caught before the {{run into the}} finish as the peloton prepared for a sprint finish. The stage was initially won by Giovanni Lombardi, but he was deemed by race judges to have had an irregular sprint and the victory was awarded to the second placed rider Giuseppe Citterio. The next day consisted of a climbing time trial to Selvino. Rominger extended his advantage over all <b>his</b> <b>competitors</b> by winning the stage {{by a margin of}} one minute and thirty-nine seconds over Berzin. The eighteenth stage was plagued by rainy conditions throughout the undulating course. The day's breakaway consisted of sixteen riders, which Tony Rominger's Mapei team chose not to chase down. Denis Zanette and Giuseppe Guerini formed an attack group from the breakaway and rode into the finish where Zanette managed to edge out Guerini for the win. The main contenders did not have any time gaps during the stage, leaving the general classification unchanged.|$|E
5|$|Like many {{residents}} of the rural areas in central Madagascar at that time, Rakoto's brothers played the sodina, an end-blown tube traditionally made of bamboo or reed with three or six finger holes and a thumb hole down its length. One {{of the oldest and}} most iconic musical instruments in Madagascar, it is believed to have arrived on the island with the earliest settlers from Borneo around 2,000 years ago and remains widespread throughout the central highlands. Young Rakoto began playing the sodina when he was seven years old. He honed his skills by listening to village elders' sodina performances, and three years later the boy formed a small musical group called Ambohijatobe that performed locally at traditional festivities. During this period Rakoto had the opportunity to participate in a community musical competition. <b>His</b> <b>competitors,</b> who performed on accordions and guitars, threw stones at Rakoto when he stepped forward to perform on the sodina. Despite being struck in the face he completed his performance and was awarded first prize. In 1935 he was nominated by the local governor to represent his district in a national musical competition organized by the French colonial authority at Mahamasina stadium in Antananarivo. That same year Rakoto was orphaned at the age of 12, preventing him from further pursuing an education in the interest of earning a livelihood. A Frenchman hired the boy to work as an assistant baker until he came of age. Upon reaching adulthood, Rakoto left the bakery to become a metalworker while continuing to perform on the sodina in musical ensembles.|$|E

5|$|The {{end of the}} 2008 {{athletics}} season saw Bolt {{compete in}} the ÅF Golden League, beginning in Weltklasse Zürich. Despite having the slowest start among <b>his</b> <b>competitors</b> in the 100 m race, he still crossed the finishing line in 9.83 s. Even though the time was slower than both his newly set world record and Asafa Powell's track record, it was still among the top-fifteen 100 m finishes by any sprinter to that date. Bolt admitted {{that he was not}} running at full strength, suffering from a cold, but he had concentrated on both winning the race and finishing the season in good health. At the Super Grand Prix final in Lausanne, Bolt ran his second-fastest 200 m with a time of 19.63 s, equalling Xavier Carter's track record. However, it was the 100 m final, featuring Asafa Powell, that drew the most interest. Powell had moved closer to Bolt's world record after setting a new personal best of 9.72 s, reaffirming his status as Bolt's main contender. Bolt's final event of the season came three days later at the Golden League final in Brussels. This was the first 100 m race featuring both Bolt and Powell since the final in the Olympics. Both Jamaicans broke the track record, but Bolt came out on top with a time of 9.77 s, beating Powell by 0.06 s. Victory, however, did not come as smoothly as it had in Beijing. Bolt made the slowest start of the nine competitors and had to recover ground in cold conditions and against a 0.9m/s headwind. Yet the results confirmed Jamaican dominance in the 100 m, with nine of the ten-fastest legal times in history being recorded by either Bolt or Powell.|$|E

25|$|The {{confusion}} regarding Stalin's {{position on}} the issue {{stems from the fact}} that he, after Lenin's death in 1924, successfully used Lenin's argument– the argument that socialism's success needs the workers of other countries in order to happen– to defeat <b>his</b> <b>competitors</b> within the party by accusing them of betraying Lenin and, therefore, the ideals of the October Revolution.|$|E
