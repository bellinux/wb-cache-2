5|$|A {{photograph}} of the building that was to house the theater appeared in The Morning Oregonian newspaper in 1913. Known as the Kleist Building after its owner, Edward Kleist, it had a pressed brick front and walls with hollow tiles. The second <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> intended for residential rooms and apartments, and the ground <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> designed for business storerooms and a movie theater. According to a February 1915 newspaper advertisement, The Exploits of Elaine, {{the first in a}} continuing series of Craig Kennedy detective stories, was to show at The Clinton on March 1.|$|E
5|$|At six storeys, the Great Southern Hotel was {{the first}} Chinese hotel to have a lift. The {{original}} design accommodated offices on the first storey, the hotel on {{the second and third}} storeys, a restaurant on the fifth storey, and a tea house on the roof terrace as well as a cabaret. The restaurant on the fourth <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> later converted into the owner's office. The whole of the fifth <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> occupied by a then-well-known cabaret, the Southern Cabaret. Shops and entertainment outlets, including a Hainanese kopitiam, were situated on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{the stone}} <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> {{replaced}} {{with one of}} marble.|$|E
25|$|Vawter Hall– A co-ed {{residence}} hall {{located in}} the President's quad near Owens Dining Hall and Hokie Grill. Vawter was all-male until 2013, when it was made co-ed. The <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> separated by gender: first <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> all-male, second <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> co-ed, and third <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> all female.|$|R
50|$|The church's {{building}} is six stories tall. The first two <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> a dedicated public library, which serves both Christian and non-Christian books. The fourth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> used for outreach, the fifth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> a lodge for guest workers from abroad, and the sixth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> {{used as a}} worship hall.|$|R
50|$|The {{terminal}} occupies 900 sq metre. There <b>are</b> three <b>floors.</b> On {{the ground}} <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> six departure service desks. On the first <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> six arrival service desks. Second <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> for office use.|$|R
5|$|The Princess Block {{disappeared}} from Henderson’s Directory, a local city directory, in 1956, implying that its researchers {{thought it was}} completely vacant. The building was re-included in 1960, but the theatre's former address at 10337 Whyte Avenue remained vacant and unlisted for another six years. By 1966, the exterior doors had been removed entirely to create storefronts (see photo), and the theatre itself had been occupied by Quick Cash Exchange, a pawnshop. The third <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> split into several apartments, while the second <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> entirely occupied by Strathcona TV and Columbia Photo Studio. The basement was still a pool hall, Princess Billiards.|$|E
5|$|The current fish {{house was}} built between 1322 and 1335 when Adam of Sodbury was the Abbot of Glastonbury who also built the Church of St Mary {{in the village and}} the Manor House as his summer residence. It may have {{replaced}} a previous abbey building. The upper <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> the abode of the chief fisherman when he visited intermittently and the ground <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> used for storing nets and the salting and preparing fish. Some alterations were made, probably in the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|The house {{alongside}} the Jewel Tower {{was taken over}} by the new department in 1869, and the standards and testing equipment were installed in the tower itself, which was felt to be particularly suitable for making scientific measurements, because of its thick walls. The roof, which was in poor condition, was repaired. The ground <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> used as a weighing room and for storing glass fluid measures, the first floor held the standards of length, and the second <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> used as a museum to display old historical equipment.|$|E
5000|$|The southwestern {{interior}} <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> partly overlaid by {{the outer}} [...] of Ioffe. The northern <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> marked by several small craters, while the southeastern <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> impacted {{by a number}} of tiny craterlets.|$|R
50|$|From {{the fourth}} to the {{eleventh}} {{floor of the}} main building, there are 196 rooms. The eleventh <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> especially designed for business rooms; the tenth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> non-smoking and the twelfth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> for presidential suites.|$|R
50|$|The {{museum is}} a three-story building. The first <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> the lobby, {{entrance}} and administrative {{offices of the}} museum. The second <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> the handover gifts exhibition gallery and the special exhibition gallery. The third <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> the auditorium.|$|R
5|$|The {{resulting}} castle {{centred on}} a stone tower-keep, measuring 60 feet by 24 feet (18 m by 7 m) internally and 54 feet (16 m) tall, with four round corner-towers. The tower-keep had eight-foot (2.4 m) thick walls made from Lias Oolite ashlar stone and was designed around three floors. The corner towers had conical roofs and prominent machicolations. The ground floor of the tower-house included the kitchen and other service areas. The functions {{of the first and}} second floors are uncertain; one theory is that the first <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> another service area, with the hall on the second floor; another approach argues that the first floor formed the hall, and the second floor living accommodation; a minority view proposes that the first <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> an armoury. The third <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> used as living accommodation for the owning family. The original design had a number of windows and fireplaces on the upper floors, but the hall would have been relatively dark and the stairs were inconveniently narrow.|$|E
5|$|The script of the unfilmed Sarah Jane Adventures episode The Thirteenth <b>Floor</b> <b>was</b> rewritten and {{broadcast}} as {{an episode of}} Wizards vs Aliens.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} terraced {{into the side}} of a mound, so the {{northern}} side of the basement is partially below ground level. As was typical of most keeps, the bottom <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18thcentury when the <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts. The basement is lit through small slits.|$|E
5000|$|The {{eastern part}} of the {{interior}} <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> partly overlaid by the outer [...] and ejecta from Von Zeipel. The southern <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> marked by an arc of small impacts. The northern <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> more level and is marked only by a few small craterlets.|$|R
50|$|Laminate and vinyl <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> often {{confused}} with engineered wood <b>floors,</b> but <b>are</b> not; laminate uses {{an image of}} wood on its surface, while vinyl <b>flooring</b> <b>is</b> plastic formed to look like wood.|$|R
50|$|Generally, the {{interior}} has {{a mixture of}} timber boarded and concrete floors {{on the ground floor}} and timber boarded floors on the first floor. The interior walls of the ground <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> rendered masonry and the internal walls of the first <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> mostly rendered masonry with some timber boarded partitioning. The ceilings of the ground <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> rendered plaster and plasterboard and the ceilings on the first <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> timber boarded. Generally, {{the interior}} of the ground <b>floor</b> has <b>been</b> altered both in finish and planning and the interior of the first <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> more intact. Features such as the ground floor fireplaces, coat of arms and the platform in the hall are no longer there.|$|R
5|$|Below {{the tower}} is an Italianate building. On the ground <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> the Scarlet Drawing Room and a {{vestibule}} with an annexe which housed a kitchen and offices. The first floor held the Crimson Drawing Room, sanctuary and library.|$|E
5|$|In 1833 a large {{earthquake}} on {{the west}} coast of Sumatra struck up a tsunami which destroyed much of Padang. The mosque was one of several buildings which survived the tsunami. Its stone <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> later replaced by a mixture of clam shells and pumice.|$|E
5|$|Montacute, {{like many}} Elizabethan mansions, is built in an 'E' shape, a much-used plan in this era. On the ground <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> the great hall, kitchens and pantries, {{on the upper}} floors, {{retiring}} rooms for the family and honoured guests. Over the centuries, the layout and use of rooms changed: drawing and dining rooms evolved on the ground floor.|$|E
50|$|The Crane Company Building is a {{skyscraper}} {{located at}} 836 S. Michigan Ave. in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois. The twelve-story building {{was designed by}} Holabird & Roche and built in 1912. The steel frame skyscraper was designed in the Classical Revival style, and its exterior design is split into three sections. The first and second <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> faced in limestone and feature piers supporting a cornice; the third <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> also covered in limestone. The fourth through eleventh <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> constructed in red brick; windows on these floors feature terra cotta keystones and sills, and the eleventh <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> capped by a terra cotta cornice. The twelfth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> decorated in terra cotta panels which incorporate Crane Company valves in their design; this <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> also topped by a cornice.|$|R
50|$|As at March 2016, {{the ground}} <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> {{occupied}} {{by a number of}} shops, while the upper <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> a 3-bedroom apartment.|$|R
5000|$|Bamboo <b>flooring</b> <b>is</b> {{made from}} a fast-growing {{renewable}} [...] "timber" [...] (bamboo is actually a grass). It is natural anti-bacterial, water-resistant and extremely durable. DIY installation is easy, as bamboo <b>flooring</b> <b>is</b> available with tongue-and-groove technology familiar in hardwood/laminate alternatives. Bamboo <b>flooring</b> <b>is</b> often more expensive than laminate, though it is generally cheaper than traditional hardwood flooring. Some bamboo <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> less sustainable than others, as they contain the toxic substance formaldehyde (rather than natural-base adhesives).|$|R
5|$|Ryan {{attempts}} to make a horror film titled The 3rd Floor using Dunder Mifflin as a location, and workers such as Kelly, Erin, Gabe, Kevin and Meredith as actors. The 3rd <b>Floor</b> <b>was</b> written by Jonathan Hughes, Kelly Hannon and Mary Wall and directed by Mindy Kaling.|$|E
5|$|South of {{the great}} hall was a two-storey {{building}} containing withdrawing chambers, dating from around 1200. Narrow windows opening onto the bailey were original but have since been filled in. The first <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> entirely occupied by the great chamber, furnished with a fireplace. In the south-west {{corner of the room}} was a door to a small room which was perhaps used as a safe. The ground <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> used as a cellar, through which the Carrickfergus Tower could be accessed. The polygonal tower was also accessible through the great chamber at first floor level. Fitted with latrines and a fireplace, it was an extension of the lordly accommodation provided by the great chamber.|$|E
5|$|The Order of St. John was {{expelled}} from Malta with the French invasion and occupation in 1798. Being located opposite Napoleon's residence at Palazzo Parisio, the auberge was converted into the French military command. After Malta fell under British rule in 1800, it was used by both the military and civil administrations. In 1888 the ground <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> used to store the notary archives and the upper <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> occupied by the Department of Work. At this point the ground floor also served as the Government Printing Office, while the upper <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> also used by the Royal Engineers. It later served as the Corps Headquarters and an officers' mess until the 1920s. In the early 19th century, chemist John Davy, who was in Malta with the Army Medical Staff, established a public dispensary at the auberge {{for the treatment of}} the poor and became known as the Albergo dei poveri (Auberge of the poor). The successor of this service, the Government Polyclinics, is still referred to as il-Berġa (the auberge).|$|E
50|$|Nightingale <b>floors</b> (uguisubari) , <b>were</b> <b>floors</b> {{designed}} to make a chirping sound when walked upon. These <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> used in the hallways of some temples and palaces, the most famous example being Nijo Castle, in Kyoto, Japan. Dry boards naturally creak under pressure, but these <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> designed so that the flooring nails rubbed against a jacket or clamp, causing chirping noises. The squeaking <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> used as a security device, assuring that none could sneak through the corridors undetected.|$|R
5000|$|The Warehouse {{houses the}} Syracuse University School of Design. The ground floor offers a cafe, reading room, {{community}} classrooms, lecture hall, and work spaces, a community exhibition space {{and an international}} contemporary art gallery, and is the most public space in The Warehouse. The first <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> home to the School of Design administrative offices, a large lecture space, a digital fabrication lab/wood shop, and the Genet Art Gallery. The second <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> a climate-controlled storage space for the SU library. The third <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> home to the Communications Design program; the fourth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> home to the MFA in Collaborative Design, the Museum Studies program, and the Syracuse University Office of Community Engagement and Economic Development; the fifth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> home to the Industrial + Interaction Design program; the sixth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> home to the Environmental + Interior Design (EDI) program; and the seventh <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> home to the Fashion Design program. Part of The Warehouse's basement contains spray booths and a [...] "dirty room" [...] for messy projects.|$|R
50|$|A sensing <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> a <b>floor</b> with {{embedded}} sensors. Depending {{on their}} construction, these <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> either monobloc (e.g. structures {{made of a}} single frame, carpets).|$|R
5|$|The {{chapter house}} has 40sedilia lining its walls, {{and may have}} {{originally}} provided seating for more when it was the meeting room for the abbey community. In 1714 it was refurbished to become a library, and its <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> raised by about 1m (3ft). Its east end was damaged in the Bristol riots of 1831, requiring considerable restoration, {{and at that time}} or later the library furnishings were removed. In 1832, when the <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> lowered again, a Saxon stone panel depicting the Harrowing of Hell was found underneath. The discovery of the stone provides strong evidence that there was a church or shrine on the site before Robert Fitzharding founded the Abbey in 1140.|$|E
5|$|The {{second floor}} of the college had the Nyima Lhakhang where image of Shakhyamuni Buddha was deified along with Tuwang Tsultrim, and the Khangyur Lhakhang with 1000 images of Tara which {{replaced}} the sacred texts that were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. The third <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> reserved for the Dalai Lamas.|$|E
5|$|The two-story {{interior}} {{space on the}} first <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> originally used for carriages and then for automobiles, and now is used as an indoor exercising ring for the horses occupying the stalls below. In the end pavilions, there is a reception area, tack room, and small apartment designed to be occupied by the riding instructor.|$|E
