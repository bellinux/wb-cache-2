50|$|He {{was born}} at Thionville, {{the son of a}} procureur in the bailliage of Thionville. After {{studying}} theology, he began a career in law, and in 1788 was an avocat at the parlement of Metz. In 1790 he was <b>elected</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>officer</b> of Thionville, and was sent by the department of Moselle to the Legislative Assembly. On 23 October 1791 he moved and carried the institution of a committee of surveillance, of which he became a member. It was he who proposed the law sequestrating the property of the émigrés, and he took an important part in the Demonstration of 20 June 1792 and in the revolution of 10 August of the same year.|$|E
50|$|Many {{states require}} <b>elected</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>officers</b> {{to be at}} least 18 years of age or be a {{registered}} voter in the city thereof. Montana requires mayors {{to be at least}} 21 years of age.|$|R
50|$|Standing {{committees}} are the prime instruments for public consultation. They {{are responsible for}} the public study of pending matters and for making the appropriate recommendations to the council. They also review the annual budget forecasts for departments under their jurisdiction. A public notice of meeting is published in both French and English daily newspapers at least seven days before each meeting. All meetings include a public question period. The standing committees, of which there are seven, have terms lasting two years. In addition, the City Council may decide to create special committees at any time. Each standing committee is made up of seven to nine members, including a chairman and a vice-chairman. The members are all <b>elected</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>officers,</b> {{with the exception of a}} representative of the government of Quebec on the public security committee.|$|R
5000|$|Town Meeting Day (the first Tuesday in March) {{is a state}} holiday. Most {{organized}} towns {{operate under}} the general statutes requiring an annual town meeting on that day or, optionally, on preceding days if the voters so choose. The purpose of town meeting is to <b>elect</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>officers,</b> approve annual budgets and conduct any other business. All cities and some towns in Vermont operate under charters instead of general legislation (see special legislation). The cities and chartered towns, except for South Burlington, are required {{by the terms of}} their charters to hold an annual town meeting, on Town Meeting Day. Many towns vote on matters of substance (e.g., budgets, elected officials, etc.) by secret ballot (also known as Australian ballot). However, there is no state law that requires towns to vote by Australian ballot; several towns still conduct all business [...] "from the floor".|$|R
50|$|The {{consolidated}} City's first Mayor, Robert A. Van Wyck, was <b>elected</b> {{with other}} <b>municipal</b> <b>officers</b> in November 1897. Mayoral Elections {{had previously been}} held since 1834 by the City of Brooklyn and the smaller, unconsolidated City of New York (Manhattan plus part of The Bronx).|$|R
50|$|The {{reign of}} Caesar Augustus saw the final decline of {{democratic}} elections in Rome. Augustus undermined and lessened {{the significance of}} the election results, eventually eliminating elections entirely. He also diminished the importance of the offices themselves - the senate was full of his supporters, so candidacy was based on flattery and not on merit, since he could nominate senators freely and essentially controlled all membership. Augustus had extensive influence over the magistrates as well; he was given the power to grant commendation to candidates for office, which became a guarantee of winning the election. He later nullified the power of the elected tribunes by assuming the powers of a tribune without actually holding the office itself, allowing him to act as one without other tribunes challenging him. This included casting down any legislation proposed by the others, significantly decreasing the power of the tribunes. Because of this, even though elections still occurred, the results mattered far less than they had under the Republic. Eventually, late in his principate, Augustus eliminated direct election entirely, establishing designatio by a group of senators and equites. Citizens were still allowed to <b>elect</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>officers,</b> but filling higher level posts was left entirely to those already in power.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with all}} medieval kingdoms, supreme power was {{understood}} {{to reside in}} the monarch [...] "by the grace of God", as the legal formula explained. Nevertheless, rural and urban communities began to form assemblies to issue regulations to deal with everyday problems. Over time, these assemblies evolved into municipal councils, known as variously as ayuntamientos or cabildos, in which some of the inhabitants, the property-owning heads of households (vecinos), represented the rest. By the 14th century these councils had gained more powers, such {{as the right to}} <b>elect</b> <b>municipal</b> magistrates and <b>officers</b> (alcaldes, speakers, clerks, etc.) and representatives to the parliaments (Cortes).|$|R
50|$|A study {{released}} by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities in early 2009 found that women outnumbered men as <b>municipal</b> chief administrative <b>officers</b> or city managers - a position which is hired, not elected - in Canada. However, they still lagged significantly behind men as <b>elected</b> <b>municipal</b> councillors and mayors, representing just 23 per cent of all <b>elected</b> <b>municipal</b> officials. Only in Canada's three territories, Nunavut, Yukon and the Northwest Territories, did women represent {{more than one-third of}} <b>elected</b> <b>municipal</b> officials {{at the time of the}} study, and the Yukon was the only province or territory in all of Canada where more than one-third of all mayors were women.|$|R
5000|$|Constant's other {{concerns}} included a [...] "new type of federalism": a serious attempt to decentralize French government through the devolution of powers to <b>elected</b> <b>municipal</b> councils. This proposal reached fruition in 1831, when <b>elected</b> <b>municipal</b> councils (albeit {{on a narrow}} franchise) were created.|$|R
