5|$|Four exemplifications of the 1225 charter survive: the British Library holds one, {{which was}} {{preserved}} at Lacock Abbey until 1945; Durham Cathedral also holds a copy, with the Bodleian Library holding a third. The fourth {{copy of the}} 1225 <b>exemplification</b> was held by the museum of the Public Record Office and is now held by The National Archives. The Society of Antiquaries also holds {{a draft of the}} 1215 charter (discovered in 2013 in a late 13th-century register from Peterborough Abbey), a copy of the 1225 third re-issue (within an early 14th-century collection of statutes) and a roll copy of the 1225 reissue.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{copies of}} the 1300 <b>exemplification</b> by Edward I survive, in Faversham, Oriel College, Oxford, the Bodleian Library, Durham Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, the City of London (held in the {{archives}} at the London Guildhall) and Sandwich (held in the Kent County Council archives). The Sandwich copy was rediscovered in early 2015 in a Victorian scrapbook in the town archives of Sandwich, Kent, one of the Cinque Ports. In {{the case of the}} Sandwich and Oriel College exemplifications, the {{copies of the}} Charter of the Forest originally issued with them also survive.|$|E
5|$|The Order is {{dedicated}} to the principles of Charity, Unity, Fraternity, and Patriotism. A First Degree <b>exemplification</b> ceremony, by which a man joins the Order, explicates the virtue of charity. He {{is said to be a}} First Degree Knight of Columbus; after participating in the subsequent degrees, each of which focuses on another virtue, he rises to that status. Upon reaching the Third Degree, a gentleman is a full member. Priests do not participate directly in Degree exemplifications as laymen do, but rather take the degree by observation.|$|E

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to change one's coat of arms, with or without adopting or appending a new surname, by Royal Licence, {{that is to say}} a licence {{in the form of a}} warrant from the Crown directed to the Kings of Arms instructing them to exemplify the transferred arms or a version of them to the licensee in his or her new name. Royal Licences are issued on the advice of Garter King of Arms and are usually dependent on there being some constraining circumstances such as a testamentary injunction (a requirement in a will) or a good reason to wish to perpetuate a particular coat of arms. The Royal Licence is of no effect until and unless the <b>exemplification</b> is issued and recorded in the College. Royal Licences are gazetted and make a deed poll unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Other early {{versions}} of the charters survive today. Only one <b>exemplification</b> of the 1216 charter survives, held in Durham Cathedral. Four copies of the 1217 charter exist; three of these are held by the Bodleian Library in Oxford and one by Hereford Cathedral. Hereford's copy is occasionally displayed alongside the Mappa Mundi in the cathedral's chained library and has survived along with a small document called the Articuli super Cartas that was sent along with the charter, telling the sheriff of the county how to observe the conditions outlined in the document. One of the Bodleian's copies was displayed at San Francisco's California Palace of the Legion of Honor in 2011.|$|E

50|$|Transience {{of knowing}} vs. {{permanence}} of knowledge. It {{is the nature}} of human beings that we are mortal. We all die, and our knowing dies with us. But educology and recorded <b>exemplifications</b> of educological knowing do not die. While a person's cognitive function ceases with that person, recorded propositions about education remain in the recorded media, and recorded <b>exemplifications</b> of educological knowing also remain in the recorded media. Each person who comes anew as a student to the fund of educology and the recorded <b>exemplifications</b> of educological knowing has the opportunity to extend her or his educological knowing. In addition, new generations, through successful educological research (retro-search, re-search, neo-search) have the opportunity to contribute to the revision and extension of the fund of warranted assertions which constitutes educology.|$|R

25|$|Another <b>exemplification</b> of Cuban Linxs {{influence}} {{is in the}} spike in popularity of Cristal, an expensive champagne, which was mentioned on the album and touted by Rae and Ghost. It {{has now become a}} staple in hip hop, with name-drops that continue to this day. The brand even made its way into popular culture when director Quentin Tarantino, a known affiliate of RZA and the Wu-Tang Clan, goes on a rant about the champagne's quality in his segment of Four Rooms, a film released in the months after Raekwon's album.|$|E
25|$|Poetry has {{consistently}} {{been held in}} extremely high regard in China, often incorporating expressive folk influences filtered through the minds of Chinese literati. In Chinese culture, poetry has provided a format and a forum for {{both public and private}} expressions of deep emotion, offering an audience of peers, readers, and scholars insight into the inner life of Chinese writers across more than two millennia. Westerners also have found in it an interesting and pleasurable field of study, in its <b>exemplification</b> of essential contrasts between the Western world and Chinese civilization, and on its own terms.|$|E
25|$|The {{second group}} {{includes}} the single-family residences built by wealthy Detroiters {{in the latter}} part of the 19th century and in the early 20th century. This group includes the John N. Bagley House (1889), the William H. Wells House (1889), the Franklin H. Walker House (1896), the Arthur M. Parker House (1901), and the Frederick K. Stearns House (1902), all listed in this T.R., as well as the Thomas A. Parker House (1868), the Croul-Palms House (1881), and homes in the Indian Village Historic District which were listed on the NRHP at an earlier date. These architect-designed structures are distinguished by their elaborate and expensive construction and <b>exemplification</b> of popular architectural styles.|$|E

25|$|The Duchy of Lancaster, {{like the}} Crown, {{was no longer}} a {{distinct}} force in Derbyshire, so the immensely rich Cromwell, with a base in the east of the county, was a useful counterweight {{to the power of the}} Greys and Staffords. Cromwell was a prominent member of the royal household and one of the dominant small nucleus in the council. Cokayne allowed himself to be drawn into the complex property deals and lawsuits of Cromwell and his circle. One of Cokayne's services was to pledge support for Cromwell's prosecution of John Grey, Baron Grey of Codnor, over his claim to the manor of Crich in Derbyshire. This took place in 1430 but is known from a long and complicated <b>exemplification</b> obtained by Cromwell in 1433, which shows the breadth of his dealings in the region, with numerous Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire estates claimed by himself or his representatives. Cromwell had obtained judgement against Grey the previous summer but when he launched his prosecution, with the support of Cokayne and his own lawyers, he was still having difficulty in actually gaining possession of Crich.|$|E

500|$|A new Military Overseas Europe Special District was {{established}} in 2013 to oversee assemblies of military personnel serving on that continent. [...] Over 100 Department of Defense civilian employees and active-duty personnel based in Germany, Italy, and Britain {{took part in a}} special Fourth Degree <b>Exemplification</b> Ceremony at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany in 2013.

500|$|About 1,400 members {{attended}} the first <b>exemplification</b> of the Fourth Degree at the Lenox Lyceum in New York on February 22, 1900. The event was infused with Catholic and patriotic symbols, imagery that [...] "celebrated American Catholic heritage". [...] The two knights leading the ceremony, for example, were the Expositor of the Constitution and the Defender of the Faith. The ritual soon {{spread to other}} cities. [...] The new Fourth Degree members returned to their councils, forming assemblies composed of members from several councils. [...] Those assemblies chose the new members.|$|E

He called [...] "The Perfect Mate" [...] the <b>exemplification</b> of the [...] "depiction of woman as a passive reflection of a male partner". He compared the Federation non-interference in a people who treat women as gifts to the involvement of the United States in the Gulf War in defence of Kuwait, a country which limits rights for women.|$|E

500|$|Only two exemplifications of Magna Carta {{are held}} outside England, both from 1297. One {{of these was}} {{purchased}} in 1952 by the Australian Government for £12,500 from King's School, Bruton, England. This copy is now {{on display in the}} Members' Hall of Parliament House, Canberra. The second was originally held by the Brudenell family, earls of Cardigan, before they sold it in 1984 to the Perot Foundation in the United States, which in 2007 sold it to U.S. businessman David Rubenstein for US$21.3million. Rubenstein commented [...] "I have always believed that this was an important document to our country, even though it wasn't drafted in our country. I think it was the basis for the Declaration of Independence and the basis for the Constitution". This <b>exemplification</b> is now on permanent loan to the National Archives in Washington, D.C.
