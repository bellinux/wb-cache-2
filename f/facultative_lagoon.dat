50|$|<b>Facultative</b> <b>lagoons,</b> {{where there}} is {{insufficient}} energy provided by the aeration equipment to keep the sludge in suspension and solids settle to the lagoon floor. The biodegradable solids in the settled sludge then degrade as in an anaerobic lagoon.|$|R
50|$|The <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon</b> in {{the pond}} {{sequence}} functions like the primary clarifier of a conventional sewage treatment system. Heavy solids will settle {{to the bottom of}} the lagoon, and lighter solids will float. This <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon</b> lacks the sludge removal capability of a primary clarifier, so a population of anaerobic organisms will colonize accumulated sludge on the bottom of the lagoon. The surface area of the lagoon should be large enough to provide an atmospheric oxygen transfer rate adequate to prevent anaerobic conditions on the lagoon surface. Intermediate depths of the lagoon support facultative micro-organisms capable of oxidizing both the dissolved and suspended organics from the original wastewater and the products of anaerobic catabolism on the bottom of the lagoon.|$|E
50|$|Overflow {{from the}} <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon</b> may be routed through {{one or more}} {{polishing}} ponds supporting lower populations of anaerobic micro-organisms and {{a higher proportion of}} aerobic organisms adapted to survival in lower concentrations of organic material. Effluent from the final polishing pond may be suitable for discharge to natural receiving waters.|$|E
5000|$|Objectionable odors {{are likely}} when {{the rate of}} oxygen {{transfer}} from the lagoon surface {{is less than the}} rate of oxygen consumption in the lower levels of the lagoon. A 1 acre <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon</b> might provide 50 pounds of oxygen per day (5 grams of oxygen per square meter per day) for biochemical catabolism. Biological activity within a <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon</b> varies directly with temperature. Warm weather will require large oxygen transfer rates, and waste accumulation during cold weather can cause short-term warm weather oxygen requirements to exceed long-term waste loading rates. [...] Algae can provide surface oxygen during daylight hours, but algal respiration can require additional oxygen during darkness. [...] Ice or scum mats can reduce the oxygen transfer surface. Some facultative lagoons use mechanical surface aerators to increase atmospheric oxygen transfer, but aerator mixing depth should not re-suspend anaerobic sludge {{from the bottom of the}} lagoon. Aerator operation may be limited to periods of heavy waste loads, high temperatures, darkness, low wind velocity, or other conditions threatening to cause anaerobic conditions on the lagoon surface.|$|E
40|$|Facultative waste {{stabilization}} ponds, {{sometimes referred}} to as lagoons or ponds, are frequently used to treat municipal and industrial wastewater in the United States. The technology associated with <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoons</b> has been in widespread use in the United States for at least 90 years, with more than 7, 000 <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoons</b> in operation today. These earthen lagoons are usually 1. 2 to 2. 4 m (4 to 8 feet) in depth and are not mechanically mixed or aerated. The layer of water near the surface contains dissolved oxygen due to atmospheric reaeration and algal respiration, a condition that supports aerobic and facultative organisms.

High rates of pumping consolidated the clays and lowered the old lake bed by about 4 meters in places. The reuse component of the Texcoco plans include the construction of a <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon</b> wastewater treatment system, and reclamation of the collected storm water for agricultural irrigation. Thus, the potable water currently used for this purpose will be replaced.|$|E

50|$|Log ponds are {{convenient}} reservoirs {{for water}} recycling in applications including hydraulic debarkers or dust suppression. Log ponds offer some wastewater treatment {{similar to a}} settling basin and <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon.</b> Log pond overflow during rainfall and snowmelt may contain floating pieces of wood and bark, dissolved organic compounds leached from wood, and suspended particles of sawdust and soil. The United States Environmental Protection Agency published wet storage category effluent limitations in the 1970s prohibiting discharge of floating woody debris and requiring log pond overflow pH to be between 6 and 9.|$|E
50|$|<b>Facultative</b> <b>lagoons</b> are {{a type of}} {{stabilization}} pond used for biological treatment of industrial and domestic wastewater. Sewage or organic waste from food or fiber processing may be catabolized {{in a system of}} constructed ponds where adequate space is available to provide an average waste retention time exceeding a month. A series of ponds prevents mixing of untreated waste with treated wastewater and allows better control of waste residence time for uniform treatment efficiency.|$|R

40|$|An {{anaerobic}} lagoon {{is a deep}} impoundment, essentially free of dissolved oxygen, {{that promotes}} anaerobic conditions. The process typically takes place in deep earthen basins, and such ponds are used as anaerobic pretreatment systems. Anaerobic lagoons are not aerated, heated, or mixed. The typical depth of an aerated lagoon is greater than eight feet, with greater depths preferred. Such depths minimize the effects of oxygen diffusion from the surface, allowing anaerobic conditions to prevail. In this respect, anaerobic lagoons are different from shallower aerobic or <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoons,</b> making the process analogous to that experienced with a singlestage unheated anaerobic digester, except that anaerobic lagoons are in an an open earthen basin...|$|R
50|$|Vertical {{stratification}} {{including an}} aerobic surface layer, an anaerobic bottom layer, and a facultative intermediate layer {{is essential to}} proper functioning of a <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon</b> ecosystem. Stratification is maintained by a thermal gradient of cool, dense water {{at the bottom of}} the lagoon overlain by warmer, less dense water on the surface. This thermal gradient becomes unstable when water reaches its maximum density at 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit). Facultative lagoons are impractical in cold climates, because the lagoons become non-functional when cooler air temperatures depress water temperatures below this critical value.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of waste stabilization lagoons {{for the treatment}} of five priority pollutants and two widely used commercial compounds was evaluated in laboratory model ponds. Three ponds were designed to simulate a primary anaerobic lagoon, a secondary <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon,</b> and a tertiary aerobic lagoon. Biodegradation, volatilization, and sorption losses were quantified for bis(2 -chloroethyl) ether, benzene, toluene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, ethylene glycol, and ethylene glycol monoethyl ether. A statistical model using a log normal transformation indicated biodegradation of bis(2 -chloroethyl) ether followed first-order kinetics. Additionally, multiple regression analysis indicated biochemical oxygen demand was the water quality variable most highly correlated with bis(2 -chloroethyl) ether effluent concentration. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: The use {{of waste}} {{stabilization}} ponds {{is one of the}} cheapest wastewater treatment processes. This study evaluated the effects of baffles and fixed media on coliform removal in <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoons.</b> Methods: In this study, the settled wastewater from four pond systems of the city of Ahvaz was used as input. Each system was composed of two ponds that were connected to each other serially. Three of them were equipped with two, three, and four baffles. Packages of fixed media were installed in the first baffled pond equal to the number of baffles. During a 12 -month sampling period from March 2016 to February 2017, the capability of each system to remove coliform with different detention times was studied.

40|$|Due to {{population}} expiation {{and the increased}} awareness of {{the impact on the}} environment by wastewater treatment, improved wastewater treatment systems are needed to treat municipal and agricultural wastewater. Treating wastewater with oxygen decreases carbon compounds at the expense of energy to move carbon and oxygen to be in contact with each other. Anaerobic digestion of wastewater can reduce the cost by utilizing microbes to treat high amounts of carbon in wastewater without the need for extensive oxygen requirement. With a proper balance of nutrients, microbes also produce methane, a renewable energy source. It has been suggested that microalgae be utilized to help balance the nitrogen content of wastewater for treatment by microbes. One challenge with the use of algae is the initial breakdown of algae cells. Using a digester with microorganism that can produce methane and decompose algae could enhance production of methane from the digestion of algae. The combination of wastewater, which is high in carbon content relative to nitrogen, with algae, which is high in nitrogen, could provide the balance needed for the microbes to treat wastewater and provide methane. A biomethane potential test was used to compare the ability of two microbe communities, <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon</b> sediment and anaerobic digester sludge to digest algae. Each microbe community treated dairy, swine, municipal, and petrochemical wastewater augmented with algae and acetate. The ability to degrade augmented wastewater and produce methane was determined by measuring the volume and composition of biogas produced over time. Both treatments were successful in production of methane. <b>Facultative</b> <b>lagoon</b> sediment showed more methane produced per carbon dioxide than anaerobic digester sludge...|$|E
40|$|Many rural {{communities}} in Alaska rely on large constructed lagoons {{to treat their}} wastewater. The quality of effluent released from these lagoons {{and the ability of}} the receiving bodies to dilute the effluent varies as the thawed season progresses. The receiving bodies tend to have capacity before the effluent has reached levels acceptable for discharge and algae growth degrades effluent quality as capacity in receiving bodies is decreasing, leaving only a short window to discharge effluent with minimal impact. [...] The expansion of an existing <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon</b> and the addition of a constructed wetland in Galena, Alaska is estimated to increase BOD and TSS removal to levels that will consistently exceed permit levels. The lagoon will be drawn down by discharging to the constructed wetland over a 120 day discharge period. The addition of the constructed wetland will keep TSS within permit levels even when algae drives TSS values over permit levels in the <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon.</b> [...] While the constructed wetland is expected to reduce fecal coliform concentration in the wastewater treatment facility effluent it may not bring fecal coliform levels down to below permit levels. Additional dilution or disinfection may be required. [...] Unlike BOD, TSS, and fecal coliform, which are expected to improve through the addition of the constructed wetland, dissolved oxygen levels are expected to decrease as a result of treating the wastewater in the constructed wetland. While the dissolved oxygen concentration of the constructed wetland effluent will be low, the decreased BOD concentration will result in an effluent that is more readily able to reaerate over an effluent with a higher BOD concentration. [...] Overall the results of this project suggest that adding constructed wetlands treatment to facultative lagoons prior to discharge to receiving bodies has the potential to create effluent of consistent quality that will meet or exceed ADEC permit requirements...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of two existing odor control treatments on dairy farms in NY shows {{the costs and}} benefits of each system. On one dairy farm an anaerobic digester is used to stabilize the manure and collect methane for the production of electricity. The effluent is then separated. The solids are sold, and the liquid effluent is then land applied. The other dairy farm uses a wetland treatment system. This farm uses flushing to carry the manure to shallow ponds for solid settling. The solids are recovered for off site sale. The liquid effluent is treated in a <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon.</b> The effluent from the lagoon is recycled for use as the liquid for flushing the barn and land applied. These systems have different costs, nutrient utilization and management concerns. Both of these systems achieve significant odor control and are feasible alternatives for dairy farms. Keywords...|$|E
40|$|Aeromonas {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in the aquatic environment, and {{are considered to be}} emerging organisms that can produce a series of virulence factors. The present study was carried out in a sanitary sewage stabilization pond treatment system, located in Lins, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Aeromonas species were isolated in 72. 4 % of influent samples, and in 55. 2 and 48. 3 % of effluent from anaerobic and <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoons,</b> respectively. Thirteen Aeromonas species were isolated, representing most of the recognized species of these organisms. Even though it was possible to observe a tendency of decrease, total elimination of these organisms from the studied system was not achieved.

40|$|A {{series of}} <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoons</b> {{operated}} by Thames Water treating industrial wastewater in Thailand {{were found to}} be performing poorly, particularly with respect to the removal of biological oxygen demand (BOD). A review of the design parameters for the site found that all the lagoons are of a sufficient area for the flow and BOD load. However, observations of the lagoons suggested that there may be significant hydraulic short-circuiting. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling was therefore carried out on one of the lagoons to establish the hydraulic regime. Two-consecutive simulations were carried out, both with and without baffles; the first to establish steady flow conditions, and the second using a chemical species transport model to obtain the residence time distribution (RTD). The results of the modelling indicate that the lagoons do currently suffer from significant short-circuiting, and large dead-zones are present. The installation of baffles in the CFD model improved the plug-flow characteristics of the lagoons, substantially reducing the short-circuiting {{and the size of the}} dead-zones. It has therefore been concluded that the installation of baffles in the lagoons will lead to an improvement in their performance, by increasing the retention time of the system...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} waste {{solutions}} from processes operating in Western Australia (anaerobic digester supernatants, <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon</b> treated piggery and abattoir waste effluents) were characterised chemically and by automated titration to determine acid-base characteristics. Titrations were over the pH range 2 - 12 or less. All waste solutions were excess molar ratios of NH 3 -N to PO 4 -P (5 : 1 up to 20 : 1). The amounts of acid or base reagent required for each waste solution type {{were in the}} sequence anaerobic digestor supernatant>>piggery effluent>abattoir effluent. The most efficient removal of N and P of the field samples considered is from piggery effluent.

40|$|Settleable solids {{accumulate}} (benthal layer) in stabilization lagoons, reducing volume {{for treatment}} {{and providing a}} source of oxygen demand and nutrients (feedback). The objective {{of this research was}} to define the impact of overwater dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature upon these benthal properties. Batch benthal deposits (2 : 1, vol/vol, primary clarifier underflow and waste activated sludge) under a continuous-flow overwater layer were subject to variable temperature and DO. Experiment conditions simulated a <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon.</b> Over 124 days, DO uptake was measured and effluent was sampled for chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia-N, and ortho-phosphate. Nearly all phosphorus feedback occurred in the first 31 days, and ammonia-N feedback was most constant for the duration. COD feedback was greatly reduced and DO uptake increased slightly with increasing DO. All feedbacks increased more from 15 °C to 20 °C than from 20 °C to 26 °C. Residual sludge analyses indicated that phosphorus was limiting to benthal stabilization. Temperature dependent reactions caused a linear decrease in total and volatile suspended solids...|$|E
40|$|This Environmental Assessment (EA) {{addresses}} the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) proposed action regarding an upgrade of the Pantex Plant Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF). Potential environmental consequences {{associated with the}} proposed action and alternative actions are provided. DOE proposes to design, build, and operate a new WWTF, consistent {{with the requirements of}} Title 30 of the Texas Administrative Code (TAC), Chapter 317, ''Design Criteria for Sewage Systems,'' capable of supporting current and future wastewater treatment requirements of the Plant. Wastewater treatment at Pantex must provide sufficient operational flexibility to meet Pantex Plant's anticipated future needs, including potential Plant mission changes, alternative effluent uses, and wastewater discharge permit requirements. Treated wastewater effluent and non-regulated water maybe used for irrigation on DOE-owned agricultural land. Five factors support the need for DOE action: (1) The current WWTF operation has the potential for inconsistent permit compliance. (2) The existing WWTF lies completely within the 100 -year floodplain. (3) The Pantex Plant mission has the potential to change, requiring infrastructure changes to the facility. (4) The life expectancy of the existing facility would be nearing its end by the time a new facility is constructed. (5) The treated wastewater effluent and non-regulated water would have a beneficial agricultural use through irrigation. Evaluation during the internal scoping led {{to the conclusion that the}} following factors are present and of concern at the proposed action site on Pantex Plant: (1) Periodic wastewater effluent permit exceedances; (2) Wetlands protection and floodplain management; (3) Capability of the existing facility to meet anticipated future needs of Pantex (4) Existing facility design life; and (5) Use of treated wastewater effluent and non-regulated water for irrigation. Evaluation during the internal scoping led to the conclusion that the following conditions are not present, nor of concern at the proposed site on Pantex Plant, and no further analysis was conducted: (1) State or national parks, forests, or other conservation areas; (2) Wild and scenic rivers; (3) Natural resources, such as timber, range, soils, minerals; (4) Properties of historic, archeological, or architectural significance; (5) Native American concerns; (6) Minority and low-income populations; and (7) Prime or unique farmland. In this document, DOE describes the proposed action and a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed action, including the ''No-Action'' alternative. The proposed action cited in the ''U. S. Department of Energy Application for a Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit Modifying Permit to Dispose of Waste, No. 02296,'' December 1998, included the construction of a new wastewater treatment facility, a new irrigation storage pond, and the conversion of the current wastewater treatment facility into an irrigation storage pond. Although a permit modification application has been filed, if a decision on this EA necessitates it, an amendment to the permit application would be made. The permit application would be required for any of the alternatives and the filing does not preclude or predetermine selection of an alternative considered by this EA. This permit change would allow Pantex to land-dispose treated wastewater by irrigating agricultural land. This construction for the proposed action would include designing two new lagoons for wastewater treatment. One of the lagoons could function as a <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon</b> for treatment of wastewater. The second lagoon would serve as an irrigation storage impoundment (storage pond), with the alternative use as a <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon</b> if the first lagoon is out of service for any reason. The new <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoon</b> and irrigation water storage pond would be sited outside of the 100 -year flood plain. The existing WWTF lagoon would be used as a storage pond for treated wastewater effluent for irrigation water, as needed. The two new lagoons would be linked by pipeline. This proposed construction would disturb approximately 8 acres. Potential environmental consequences of each action have been identified and evaluated.

40|$|The {{application}} of municipal wastewater to land for treatment and disposal, or "land farms, " {{was one of}} the earliest forms of wastewater treatment technology. There has been renewed interest in using these systems in arid regons worldwide to supplement and reuse dwindling water resources. However, arid regions present complex challenges to the use of land application systems. Many arid regions (for example, Egypt and US/Mexico border) are located in areas that lack infrastructure support and cannot afford expensive treatment technologies. A slow-rate, land application system offers a low-cost treatment for these regions that can be integrated with advanced, integrated ponds, <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoons</b> or other inexpensive primary and secondary treatment technologies. Properly designed land application units provide environmentally safe wastewater treatment by removing pathogens, nutrients, and suspended solids. Additionally, the wastewater can be reused to create value-added benefits such as wetlands; bosques; trees crops for fuelwood, pulpwood, or lumber; and restoration of desert ecosystems. Critical to the design is the selection of tree species adapted to an arid environment, balancing seasonal plant water requirements with plant uptake of nitrogen and the nitrogen and salt loading from the wastewater. These factors must be carefully considered to assure system sustainability and minimize impacts to groundwater. Cases in Ojinaga, Chihuahua, Mexico; Las Cruces, Ne...|$|R
40|$|For {{many rural}} communities, {{treating}} domestic wastewater efficiently and cost-effectively is a challenging task. Environmental issues, financing of construction costs, and the bottom-line {{cost to the}} consumer complicate this effort. Increasingly stringent discharge standards {{have resulted in a}} growing number of permit violations from small, “conventional ” treatment systems. Many rural communities have discovered that their existing systems (e. g., <b>facultative</b> <b>lagoons)</b> provided excellent service in the past but have become obsolete due to new discharge standards. These communities simply cannot afford to own and operate the highly sophisticated tertiary treatment facilities these new regulations require. As a result, funding agencies have looked more favorably to “regional” solutions that can achieve consistent, high-quality discharge. In most cases, the regional solution is a centralized treatment facility to which surrounding communities pump their sewage. In many instances, communities must pump extremely long distances to reach the regional treatment facility. This means that communities, and, therefore, funding agencies, are putting most of their money into pumps and piping instead of treatment. What small rural communities need is a decentralized wastewater treatment system that is inexpensive to construct, simple to operate, and achieves consistently high levels of discharge quality, even with small flows. Having such a system would allow a paradigm shift whereby funding agencies could support decentralized treatment and regional management of numerous decentralized treatment systems...|$|R
40|$|Lagoons {{have been}} {{traditionally}} used in India for decentralized treatment of domestic sewage.
