5|$|From {{the early}} 1980s onwards {{projects}} aiming to improve Somerton for film industry purposes have been undertaken. The market square was heavily revamped, creating a central parking area with <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local amenities. The BBC drama The Monocled Mutineer was filmed in Somerton from 1985 to 1986.|$|E
5|$|Rehearsals {{with the}} full Spider set were staged in Rotterdam's Ahoy Stadium {{starting}} on 18 May before moving to De Kuip stadium for the dress rehearsals (27 and 28 May). Due to relatively <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> venues during rehearsals, fans knew what the set list for the show would be before the tour even opened.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} good {{access to the}} {{motorway}} network. Junction 7 of the M60 is just {{to the north of}} Stretford's boundary with Sale, and the A56 road gives <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south as well as to Manchester city centre in the other direction. Cycle paths exist as part of the Trafford cycle initiative.|$|E

5|$|It bred on rocky, {{isolated}} islands with <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{ocean and}} a plentiful food supply, {{a rarity in}} nature that provided only a few breeding sites for the great auks. When not breeding, they spent their time foraging {{in the waters of}} the North Atlantic, ranging as far south as northern Spain and along the coastlines of Canada, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway, Ireland, and Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Storlien, {{just on the}} Swedish side of the {{national}} border, grew up as a resort, with the first hotel established just after the railway arrived. Trade {{between the two countries}} increased, as Jämtland had <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Trøndelag market. However, the freight rates were so high that it was cheaper to send some products to Trøndelag from the Swedish east coast by ship around Scania.|$|E
5|$|The {{first people}} known {{to live in}} the Catlins, Māori of the Kāti Mamoe, Waitaha, and Kāi Tahu iwi (tribes), merged via {{marriage}} and conquest into the iwi now known as Kāi Tahu. Archaeological evidence of human presence dates back to approximately 1350 AD. The area's inhabitants were semi-nomadic, travelling from Stewart Island/Rakiura in the south and inland to Central Otago. They generally dwelt near river mouths for <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> best food resources. In legend, the Catlins forests further inland were inhabited by Maeroero (wild giants).|$|E
50|$|In the Spring of 1995, Rancho San Diego Parkway, the Fury Lane {{entrance}} road, was completed, providing students <b>easier</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> College.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} {{of two major}} highways, US 90 (Crosby Freeway), and the Sam Houston Tollway, have been major drivers for growth. With <b>easier</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area, the district {{is expected to continue}} growing as new homes are built.|$|R

5|$|The main {{commercial}} and leisure {{areas of the}} town are located around the north coast, where there is <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pleasure beach. The industrial areas are in the west, beside the wetlands and the River Medway. The Bluetown industrial area and the Port of Sheerness are in the north-western part of the town. The residential districts of Mile Town and Marine Town are in the central and the eastern areas respectively.|$|E
5|$|Before the Revolution, New Englanders {{consumed}} {{large quantities}} of rum and beer as maritime trade provided relatively <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the distilled spirit of choice as molasses, the main ingredient, was readily available from trade with the West Indies. In the continent's interior, colonists drank whiskey, as they had ready access to corn and rye but did not have good access to sugar cane. However, up until the Revolution, many colonists considered whiskey to be a coarse beverage unfit for human consumption, believing that it caused the poor to become raucous and disorderly.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ranch and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of the Southern Pacific line {{increased the number of}} visitors, as the railroad featured the ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although the ranch was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was getting to be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable. The tourists could be quite a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.|$|E

5|$|Garrisoned by a captain, a knight, eight squires and ten crossbowmen, the Bastille was encircled with ditches {{fed by the}} River Seine, {{and faced}} with stone. The {{fortress}} had four sets of drawbridges, which allowed the Rue Saint-Antoine to pass eastwards through the Bastille's gates while giving <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city walls on {{the north and south}} sides. The Bastille overlooked the Saint-Antoine gate, which by 1380 was a strong, square building with turrets and protected by two drawbridges of its own. Charles V chose to live close to the Bastille for his own safety and created a royal complex to the south of the fortress called the Hôtel St. Paul, stretching from the Porte Saint-Paul up to the Rue Saint-Antoine.|$|E
5|$|Gedi's {{participation}} in maritime trade {{can be seen}} in the increasing frequency of imports found at Gedi over the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Conditions along the Atlantic coast prevented European nations from opening sea lanes until the early-sixteenth century, limiting maritime trade to states with <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Many artifacts found at Gedi including much of the ceramics, all the beads, and the two Chinese coins resulted from either direct or indirect trade with the Near East, Arabia, China, India, and Indochina. Swahili coastal settlements exported gold, ivory, slaves, ebony, mangrove poles, copper, copal gum, frankincense, myrrh, and crystal rock.|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{elephants}} in zoos {{has met with}} some controversy. Proponents of zoos argue that they offer researchers <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress. Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours {{in the form of}} swaying back and forth, trunk swaying, or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos. Elephants in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the wild.|$|E

5|$|Nash's {{designs for}} the house {{included}} a three-storey octagonal tower, with two wings coming off it and a second square tower above a porte-cochère. Inside the drawing room occupied {{the ground floor of}} the tower, with a sitting room above. The dining room was designed to hold views across the valley, and the asymmetric rooms allowed for a panorama of views. To allow <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gardens, the servant's quarters were moved to a separate wing, but made to be less prominent. A chapel was added in approximately 1862, and the house's loggia was converted into a conservatory.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} did {{not last}} very long—damage to the Inn during the Blitz completely destroyed the Library and {{a large part of}} its collection, although the rare manuscripts, which had been moved elsewhere, survived. After the destruction of much of the Inn's collection, George VI donated replacements for many lost texts. A prefabricated building in the Walks was used to hold the surviving books while a new Library was constructed, and the new building (designed by Sir Edward Maufe) was opened in 1958. It is similar in size to the old Holker Library, but is more workmanlike and designed to allow for <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> books.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} Coonley's son-in-law Waldron Faulkner, who, with his son (also an architect) Avery Coonley Faulkner, later became significant contributors {{to the design of}} George Washington University and American University in Washington, D.C. The design ties the building to the land {{in the style of the}} Prairie School, at the same time employing the handcrafted features and human scale typical of the American Arts and Crafts (or American Craftsman) style. The <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outdoors, ground floor classrooms, separate science laboratories, and planned outdoor play area are among the features of the design that would later be adopted by schools throughout the US after World War II.|$|E

50|$|In December 1996, {{plans were}} changed {{in favour of}} better car park {{arrangements}} as well as <b>easier</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> centre. The centre would soon feature more than 400 stores across three levels.|$|R
5|$|In 1995, York, Pennsylvania-based {{department}} store chain The Bon-Ton acquired the AM's chain, converting all outlets to The Bon-Ton. Later that year, on December 14, 17-year-old Cynthia Wiggins of Buffalo {{was struck by}} a dump truck while trying to get to her first day of work in the mall's food court from a NFTA Metro bus stop on Walden Avenue. The incident sparked allegations from Buffalo's African-American community that Pyramid did not want people from Buffalo's predominantly minority East Side to have <b>easy</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mall. In settling a wrongful death claim against Walden Galleria and NFTA Metro and to prevent a boycott of the mall, the bus stop was soon moved to a point inside the mall, where it remains today. Bonwit Teller closed off its upper level in 1996 as part of the chain's restructuring, with Old Navy soon opening in the store's former upper level. By the end of the year, Bonwit Teller had closed the rest of its store as well, with the lower level becoming the area's first Bed Bath & Beyond store in 1997. Also in 1996, sporting apparel retailer Finish Line opened what was then one of its largest stores, in the space vacated by Filene's Basement two years previous.|$|E
