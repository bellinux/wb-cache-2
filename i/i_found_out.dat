5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in their lives. As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E
25|$|A {{man came}} in before I left, who <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> later was Baby Face Nelson. He {{came in with}} a drum of machine gun bullets under his arm, threw them on the bed or the couch in the bedroom, and started to talk to Van Meter. The two then motioned for Dillinger to come over and the three went back into the kitchen.|$|E
25|$|When I asked {{a friend}} who worked for Fat where they think the leak came from, they pinpointed it to one {{specific}} person from a specific magazine (again, not AP) who had been begging them to hear the record. Upon hearing this person's name, I realized that same person had been emailing and IMing me incessantly {{for the past few}} weeks about trying to write for AP...Once <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> the label was holding him responsible for the leak, I promptly wrote him and let him know that AP doesn't use writers who leak records, so I would not need his services.|$|E

500|$|After {{revealing}} their deception to a busy Queen Victoria public house, Peggy slapped both Pat and Frank, rebuffed Frank's {{attempt at}} reconciliation {{and left him}} to depart alone. In December 2000, Ian Hyland of the Sunday Mirror voted the scene in which Peggy slaps both Pat and Frank {{as one of the}} [...] "TV fights of the year", saying [...] "It was Peggy's speech which really made it a Bonfire Night to remember. But the slaps were equally well dispatched." [...] Commenting on Reid's exit, Windsor has said, [...] "We fell out when <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> he was leaving because it was a shock for me. I was really upset. I've known him 30 odd years and I really like working with him. We had a great relationship as friends as well as performers. I got my own back when I had to slap him after <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> he was fooling around with Pat. I did the slap twice as I didn't think I did it hard enough the first time." ...|$|E

It's {{basically}} about coming from a very poisoned place to an empowerment, a place of strength. I've always had this fear of moths, and I subconsciously wrote this thing with these moths in it, so I guess I {{have to deal with}} it. They're furry and they carry dust. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> in old mythology they are supposed to represent the soul. I think that's very appropriate".|$|E
500|$|After {{experiencing}} headaches {{upon his}} arrival to America, N'Diaye saw {{a doctor and}} {{it was discovered that}} he was suffering from a golf ball-sized tumor in his pituitary gland, which had caused his excessive growth and was threatening his vision. Afterwards, he recalled the moment, [...] "For me, it wasn’t a big deal because I didn’t know what a tumor was. Once <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out,</b> it was tough to hear I had one." [...] The condition was treated in the Hoag Memorial Hospital following several charitable donations from around the area. A married couple who lived in Huntington Beach, California, a city close to N'Diaye's future school, offered to become his guardians to ease his commute for medical treatment.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{his playing}} career, Maxwell {{received}} several offers to turn professional. [...] the National Hockey Association's Toronto Blueshirts offered him $1,500 {{to join their}} team, while representatives of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association made an offer of $1,800 the following season. [...] He turned both offers down, preferring to remain an amateur. His feelings on what constituted an amateur player were so strong that he quit playing hockey following the 1915 Allan Cup as {{the nature of the}} senior game at the time failed to meet his expectations: [...] "When I played, I bought my own skates and boots. When <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> some of the others were getting paid, I quit." ...|$|E
500|$|Winehouse's {{greatest}} {{love was}} 1960s girl groups. Her stylist, Alex Foden, borrowed her [...] "instantly recognisable" [...] beehive hairdo (a weave) and she borrowed her Cleopatra makeup from The Ronettes. Her imitation was so successful, as The Village Voice reports: [...] "Ronnie Spector—who, {{it could be}} argued, all but invented Winehouse's style {{in the first place}} when she took the stage at the Brooklyn Fox Theater with her fellow Ronettes more than 40 years ago—was so taken aback at a picture of Winehouse in the New York Post that she exclaimed, [...] "I don't know her, I never met her, and when I saw that pic, I thought, 'That's me!' But then <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out,</b> no, it's Amy! I didn't have on my glasses." ...|$|E
500|$|The team's uniform did {{not change}} {{significantly}} after Nike became the NFL's jersey supplier in 2012, but the collar was altered to honor former Panthers player and coach Sam Mills by featuring the phrase [...] "Keep Pounding". Nike had conceived the idea, and the team supported the concept {{as a way to}} expose newer fans to the legacy of Mills, who died of cancer in 2005. Mills had introduced the phrase, which has since become a team slogan, in a speech that he gave to the players and coaches prior to their 2003 playoff game against Dallas; in the speech, Mills compared his fight against cancer with the team's on-field battle, saying [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> I had cancer, there were two things I could do – quit or keep pounding. I'm a fighter. I kept pounding. You're fighters, too. Keep pounding!" ...|$|E

500|$|Matthew West's album, Something to Say, was {{released}} on January 15, 2008. It reached No. 8 on Billboard's Top Christian albums chart, and peaked at No. 159 on the Billboard 200 chart, making it his first Billboard 200 album [...] It was produced by Brown Bannister, Ed Cash, and Christopher Stevens. West {{said in an interview}} that all of the album's songs had already been written and the title [...] "Something to Say" [...] had already been decided [...] "months before <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that I was going to have nothing to say." [...] The first radio single released from the album was [...] "You Are Everything". In March 2008, the song reached No. 1 on R's Christian AC chart. [...] "Something to Say", the album's title track, was also released to radio, receiving airplay in June 2008.|$|E
500|$|Greer was {{notified}} {{of the position}} by her agent while shooting for a separate film. [...] "I'd {{been trying to get}} into voiceovers," [...] she explained, [...] "so they called and said it was a pilot they were doing for FX, and I could record the part on my day off in 10 minutes." [...] The actress read the script and recorded her lines at a recording studio in Phoenix, Arizona; upon first glance, Greer suggested that the raunchy and risque nature of the script would prevent any television stations from picking up the series. [...] "So when <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> it was picked up, I was like, 'Oh! Wait, I don't know what you're talking about.' They said, 'Remember that thing?' And I went, 'Really?' So then I recorded a bunch of them, and the scripts were the funniest scripts that I've ever read, and so crazy." ...|$|E
500|$|Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira {{recorded}} a cover version of [...] "Islands" [...] {{for inclusion in}} her ninth studio album Sale el Sol, which was released on October 19, 2010. Although there was initial speculation that the cover would be entitled [...] "Explore", it appeared on the final track list of the album using its original name. In comparison to the original version, Shakira's cover of [...] "Islands" [...] follows a largely similar and [...] "fairly faithful" [...] instrumentation, but features a faster tempo, [...] "hopeful-sounding" [...] vocals, and [...] "pseudo-house" [...] elements. Prior to Shakira recording the cover of [...] "Islands", Croft had briefly met her at the London BBC Studios; the former talked about her meeting, saying [...] "We were sitting on a wall outside the BBC and she came up and her bodyguards parted and it was little Shakira, and she says, [...] "Hi!" [...] And I was like, Wow! <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> recently that she’s {{a big fan of}} The Cure and stuff".|$|E

500|$|Drizzt {{was created}} by happenstance. In 1987 R.A. Salvatore sent Mary Kirchoff, then {{managing}} editor of TSR's book department, a manuscript for what would become his 1990 novel Echoes of the Fourth Magic. She liked it, but {{asked if he could}} rewrite it to take place in the Forgotten Realms. She sent him Darkwalker on Moonshae by Douglas Niles, the only novel at the time set in the Forgotten Realms. Salvatore sent her a proposal for a sequel to Darkwalker, but Kirchoff sent back a large map of the Forgotten Realms and told him she wanted a new story set in {{a different part of the}} Realms. After two weeks of phone calls, Salvatore found a spot on the map that was not already designated for another project, and he located Icewind Dale there. According to Salvatore, the book was [...] "set on the Moonshae Isles, because at the time I thought that was the Realms. When <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> how big the Realms were, I moved the story a thousand miles to the north." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1999, William Broyles, Jr. {{turned down}} the chance to write the script, but decided to sign on [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> I could have an {{extensive}} amount of creative control". Fox projected the release date for July 2001, while Broyles sent the studio an outline and a chronicle of the fictional planet [...] "Aschlar". Entitled The Visitor and billed as [...] "episode one in the Chronicles of Aschlar", Broyles' script {{caught the attention of}} director Tim Burton, who was hired in February 2000. [...] "I wasn't interested in doing a remake or a sequel of the original Planet of the Apes film," [...] Burton said later. [...] "But I was intrigued by the idea of revisiting that world. Like a lot of people, I was affected by the original film. I wanted to do a 're-imagining'." [...] Richard D. Zanuck signed on as producer in March. [...] "This is a very emotional film for me. I greenlighted the original Apes when I was the head of Fox in 1967." ...|$|E
500|$|Nitin Ganatra {{who plays}} Masood Ahmed {{explains}} to Digital Spy Masood's reactions when he discovers that Yusef has taken Kamil away. [...] "Masood goes crazy over this!" [...] Nitin replies. [...] "I've got kids myself, and I know I'd react {{the same way}} if <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that some other guy had taken my child to somebody's house who the child doesn't even know. Masood is still {{the only person who}} can see Yusef for what he really is, so he goes into a blind panic over the situation. Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. The police say that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. I thought that was a great line and really interesting - I think in that moment, Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way." ...|$|E

After signing with Lyon, Nécib enrolled at the Université Lyon 1 with hopes of completing her undergraduate studies in Sciences et techniques des activités physiques et sportives (STAP) (...) [...] She developed an interest in football at a young age, prior to which she trained in gymnastics. She, initially, did not look at the future prospects of women's football and played mainly for recreation with males stating [...] "I'd always played with the boys in my neighborhood" [...] and [...] "I didn't plan to join a club because, to be honest, I didn't know girls' teams existed.

500|$|California Chrome's first graded stakes win was the March 8 Grade II San Felipe Stakes. Espinoza tried a {{different}} riding tactic {{and let the}} horse go to the lead {{right out of the}} gate. [...] California Chrome led most of the way, and after Espinoza gave him one tap on the shoulder with the whip, the horse pulled away from the field {{at the top of the}} homestretch and won by [...] lengths. Alan Sherman said, [...] "My jaw dropped", while Art Sherman joked, [...] "I'm glad I'm training at Los Alamitos, because he looked like a 350 [...] horse coming out of the gate"; a reference to Quarter Horse racing sprint distances. Espinoza remarked, [...] "I wanted to let him enjoy his race," [...] later adding, [...] "I wanted to see if he [...] go wire to wire... that was the day <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> how much he loves to run." [...] The San Felipe was California Chrome's first win in a race open to all three-year-olds, not just California-breds, and earned him 50 points in the Road to the Kentucky Derby system.|$|E
500|$|However, MacFarlane {{was criticized}} for his {{portrayal}} of transsexualism in the Family Guy episode [...] "Quagmire's Dad". Gay novelist Brent Hartinger found the episode's inclusion of transphobic remarks from Peter and Lois Griffin — {{as well as a}} scene of Brian vomiting profusely upon discovering his new girlfriend to be Glenn Quagmire's father – to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is pretty much a complete idiot". The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, a LGBT media watchdog organization, shared [...] "serious concerns being voiced from members of the community" [...] about the episode. MacFarlane said he was [...] "surprised" [...] by the negative reaction to [...] "Quagmire's Dad", saying that [...] "it seemed that [...] were not picking up on the fact that it was a very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He further added, [...] "Look, Brian happens to be a heterosexual character, as I am. If <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'" ...|$|E
