2500|$|In general, {{ultraviolet}} detectors {{use either}} a solid-state device, {{such as one}} based on silicon carbide or aluminium nitride, or a gas-filled tube as the sensing element. UV detectors that are sensitive to UV {{in any part of}} the spectrum respond to irradiation by sunlight and artificial light. A burning hydrogen flame, for instance, radiates strongly in the 185- to 260-nanometer range and only very weakly in the IR region, whereas a coal fire emits very weakly in the UV band yet very strongly at IR wavelengths; thus, a <b>fire</b> <b>detector</b> that operates using both UV and IR detectors is more reliable than one with a UV detector alone. Virtually all fires emit some radiation in the UVC band, whereas the Sun's radiation at this band is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. The result is that the UV detector is [...] "solar blind", meaning it will not cause an alarm in response to radiation from the Sun, so it can easily be used both indoors and outdoors.|$|E

40|$|Rack type {{warehouses}} {{are different}} from general buildings in the kinds, amount, and arrangement of stored goods, so the fire risk of rack type warehouses is different from those buildings. The fire pattern of rack type warehouses is different in combustion characteristic and storing condition of stored goods. The initial fire burning rate is different in the surface condition of materials, but the running time of fire is closely related {{with the kinds of}} stored materials and stored conditions. The stored goods of the warehouse are consisted of diverse combustibles, combustible liquid, and so on. Fire detection time may be delayed because the residents are less than office and commercial buildings. If <b>fire</b> <b>detectors</b> installed in rack type warehouses are inadaptable, the fire of the warehouse may be the great fire because of delaying of fire detection. In this paper, we studied what kinds of <b>fire</b> <b>detectors</b> are optimized in early detecting of rack type warehouse fire by real-scale fire tests.

The intensity of the radiation emitted by the unit is adjustable for this purpose by means of a rotatable disk having a plurality of different sized apertures for selective placement between the light source and an output lens. The disk can also be rotated to a calibration position which causes a microprocessor circuit in the unit to initiate a calibration procedure. During this procedure, the lamp intensity is measured by a photodetector contained within the unit, and the microprocessor adjusts the lamp current to insure that its intensity remains within a preset range of values. A green and a red LED are mounted on the unit which indicate to an operator whether the calibration is successful, as well as the condition of the unit's battery power supply...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMost {{but not all}} fires emit smoke {{aerosols}} at {{some point}} during the combustion process. Therefore most conventional <b>fire</b> <b>detectors</b> are based on the detection of smoke by light scattering. As every fire is emitting specific gases it is reasonable to upgrade photoelectric <b>fire</b> <b>detectors</b> or even replace them for specific environments with gas sensor based technologies. In this paper we present some gas detection technologies which have the potential to be able to amend or replace existing systems for use especially in residential <b>fire</b> <b>detectors.</b> But here some restrictions apply when using gas sensors. Among others these are low cost, low power and long term requirements. We identified advantages but also some challenges of gas detection technologies by testing colorimetric gas sensors, gas sensitive field effect transistors and metal oxide sensors. As most technologies are not completely selective to the target gas and as there is not “the” fire with one specific mixture of combustion gases it is helpful to combine different sensing elements in sensor arrays where algorithms using pattern recognition methods like PLSDA, PCA etc. can be used to increase the prediction reliability and the false alarm robustness. Here we focused on typical combustion gases like CO, CO 2, NO, NO 2, NH 3 and H 2...|$|R
