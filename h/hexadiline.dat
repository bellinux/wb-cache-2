40|$|A {{method for}} the {{quantitative}} determination of perhexiline {{and its main}} hydroxylated metabolites in human plasma, based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), was developed. The method used protein precipitation with acetonitrile followed by dilution with water and subsequent direct injection of the extract into the LC-MS system. <b>Hexadiline</b> was used as internal standard and the intra-assay coefficients of variation were <or= 5 % for perhexiline and cis-hydroxyperhexiline over the target concentration range in patients. The lower limits of quantification were 0. 005 mg/l for perhexiline and 0. 015 mg/l for cis-hydroxyperhexiline, and the measuring ranges were from 0. 05 to 3. 0 and from 0. 2 to 6. 0 mg/l, respectively. The method was compared with an established HPLC method with fluorescence detection and {{the correlation between the}} methods was close to 1 for both compounds. The predominant form of hydroxyperhexiline in 87 % of the patient samples was found {{to be one of the}} diastereomeric pairs of cis-hydroxyperhexiline. In patients not forming this metabolite, trans-hydroxyperhexiline could be detected. We conclude that the present LC-MS method is suitable for use in a clinical routine laboratory...|$|E
