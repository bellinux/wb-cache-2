40|$|Abstract: Transportation {{control systems}} are safety {{critical}} systems. While {{a couple of}} years ago control systems mainly used to be built up from (electro-) mechanical devices, nowadays more and more functionality is software controlled. To sustain the high level safety standards for these em-bedded systems, we propose to use <b>fault</b> tree <b>analysis</b> integrated with formal methods for analyzing system safety. This approach combines typical safety analysis techniques from engineering resp. software engineering. <b>Fault</b> tree <b>analysis</b> mainly focuses on system safety and considers defective components whereas formal methods mainly focuses on functional correctness. This paper presents the methodical aspects of the combination. To benefit from both, it is important to retain the different points of view of <b>fault</b> tree <b>analysis</b> and formal methods and nevertheless end up with an integrated formal model, where safety properties can formally be proven. Key words: safety <b>analysis,</b> <b>fault</b> tree <b>analysis,</b> formal methods, model checking, methodology...|$|R

40|$|Getting {{caught up}} in the {{explanation}} of <b>Fault</b> Tree <b>Analysis</b> (FTA) minutiae is easy. In fact, most FTA literature tends to address FTA concepts and methodology. Yet there seems to be few articles addressing actual design changes resulting from the successful application of <b>fault</b> tree <b>analysis.</b> This paper demonstrates how <b>fault</b> tree <b>analysis</b> was used to identify and solve a potentially catastrophic mechanical problem at a rocket motor manufacturer. While developing the fault tree given in this example, the analyst was told by several organizations that the piece of equipment in question had been evaluated by several committees and organizations, and that the analyst was wasting his time. The <b>fault</b> tree/cutset <b>analysis</b> resulted in a joint-redesign of the control system by the tool engineering group and the fault tree analyst, as well as bragging rights for the analyst. (That the fault tree found problems where other engineering reviews had failed was not lost on the other engineering groups.) Even more interesting was that this was the analyst's first fault tree which further demonstrates how effective <b>fault</b> tree <b>analysis</b> can be in guiding (i. e., forcing) the analyst to take a methodical approach in evaluating complex systems...|$|R
