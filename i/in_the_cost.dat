5|$|Economists have {{observed}} that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes a decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of using that resource when {{measured in terms of}} what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and {{it may or may not}} be large enough to offset the original drop in demand from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains.|$|E

A growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remain childless. In 2011, Japan's population dropped for a fifth year, falling by 204,000 people to 126.24 million people. This was the greatest decline since at least 1947, when comparable figures were first compiled. This decline was made worse by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Trade on the {{navigation}} was adequate, {{but the company}} was hampered by the overrun <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of construction. Dividends were paid to shareholders in 1795, 1817, 1818 and 1824, but profits had improved by 1826, and regular dividends were then paid. Between 1836 and 1856, they ranged from five per cent to eight per cent. Rather than the proprietors collecting the tolls, they were let to toll collectors. In 1816, John Keyworth paid £1,010 for the privilege, while by 1839, Joshua Bower had to pay £1,590. This practice ceased in 1851, as receipts fell.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1927 {{economic}} indicators were signalling {{the onset of}} a recession in Australia. By 1929, the evidence was unavoidable that recession was becoming depression as a resulting of rapidly deteriorating international conditions. In that year, prices for Australian exports fell by nearly a third and GDP had fallen by 10%, with no attendant fall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of living. Australia's debt now stood at £631 million the interest payments on which were equivalent to nearly half of Australia's export receipts, a situation difficult to sustain even in a positive economic climate. Investors and banks recognised the risk and Australia's credit access was rapidly drying up. Bruce's grand economic development plans had increased the national debt significantly yet had delivered only marginal economic expansion in the short term.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{customer}} {{demand for}} the product, another major reason for the reintroduction was due to a significant rise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of beef. During the previous few {{months leading up to}} the reintroduction of Chicken Fries, the available cattle stocks had declined since the USDA began record keeping in 1973. This shortage of ground beef caused a spike in the price of beef to all-time highs in June 2014, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, increasing competition from McDonald's, Wendy's and other chains in the fast food industry drove Burger King to boost sales by introducing new products along similar lines. Two major competitors had been revamping their menus with products such as variations on the McDouble from McDonald's and sandwiches based on pretzel-style buns from Wendy's.|$|E
5|$|Currency war, {{also known}} as {{competitive}} devaluations, is a condition in international affairs where countries seek to gain a trade advantage over other countries by causing the exchange rate of their currency to fall {{in relation to other}} currencies. As the exchange rate of a country's currency falls exports become more competitive in other countries, and imports into the country become more expensive. Both effects benefit the domestic industry, and thus employment, which receives a boost in demand from both domestic and foreign markets. However, the price increases for import goods (as well as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of foreign travel) are unpopular as they harm citizens' purchasing power; and when all countries adopt a similar strategy, it can lead to a general decline in international trade, harming all countries.|$|E
5|$|Iron mining {{occurred}} in several locations, including the main English centre in the Forest of Dean, {{as well as}} in Durham and the Weald. Some iron to meet English demand was also imported from the continent, especially by the late 13th century. By the end of the 12th century, the older method of acquiring iron ore through strip mining was being supplemented by more advanced techniques, including tunnels, trenches and bell-pits. Iron ore was usually locally processed at a bloomery, and by the 14th century the first water-powered iron forge in England was built at Chingley. As a result of the diminishing woodlands and consequent increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> of both wood and charcoal, demand for coal increased in the 12th century and it began to be commercially produced from bell-pits and strip mining.|$|E

5|$|No {{work was}} done to the ship over the {{following}} two years.

In return, the Ottoman government would order a pair of torpedo cruisers—the —from Germaniawerft. With the armament contract still under negotiation, Krupp was forced to concede, despite the significant financial loss the reconstruction deal represented. By April, the armament contract was signed, and so work began slowly on Asar-i Tevfik. Work was completed by late 1906. The reconstructed ship departed Kiel on 19 November, and arrived in Constantinople on 4 January 1907.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, it is {{concluded}} that the economic value of irrigation water of the same crop varies from one governorate to <b>the</b> other even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same region. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> same region, <b>the</b> variation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> economic value of irrigating crop is due to <b>the</b> variations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> and revenue of the crop production and not to <b>the</b> variation <b>in</b> quantity of applied water.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{health care}} <b>costs</b> of {{population}} ageing are for {{an important part}} attributable to higher mortality rates in combination with high costs of dying. This paper answers three questions that remain unanswered regarding <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of dying: (1) contributions of different health services to <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of dying; (2) variation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of dying; and (3) the influence of preceding health care expenses on <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of dying. We retrieved data on 61, 495 Dutch subjects aged 65 and older from July 2007 through 2010 from a regional health care insurer. We included all deceased subjects of whom health care expenses were known for 26 months prior to death (n ¼ 2833). Costs of dying were defined as health care expenses made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last six months before death. Lorenz curves, generalized linear models and a two-part model were used for our analyses. (1) <b>The</b> average <b>costs</b> of dying are V 25, 919. Medical care contributes to 57 % of this total, and long-term care 43 %. <b>The</b> <b>costs</b> of dying mainly relate to hospital care (40 %). (2) <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of dying, 75 % is attributable to the costliest half of the population. For medical care, this distribution figure is 86 %, and for long-term care 92 %. Age and preceding expenses are significant determinants of this variation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of dying. (3) Overall, higher preceding health care expenses are associated with higher costs of dying, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of dying are higher for those with a longer patient history. To summarize, {{there is not a}} large variation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> of dying, but there are large differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nature of these <b>costs.</b> Before death, <b>the</b> oldest old utilize more long-term care while their younger counterparts visit hospitals more often.
