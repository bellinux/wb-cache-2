5|$|The 19th-century station {{building}} {{is owned by}} NS Stations. It is of the type SS 3rd class, which was designed by Karel Hendrik van Brederode. SS 3rd class was chosen instead of the smaller SS 4th class because {{of the importance of}} Winschoten as a commercial center. Eight buildings of SS 3rd class were completed in the Netherlands between 1862 and 1865, of which four remain today. This building of 1865 has a median risalit and wings on both sides parallel to the railway. The facade on the city side and railway side are identical, except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> round decoration on the city side. The doors and windows of the building have arched frames. In the 1904 expansion, an enclosed porch was added and the east wing was extended with an extra waiting room.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{presented}} the {{bill on the}} floor of the House of Representatives on April 6, 1918. He was quizzed by North Carolina's Claude Kitchin, who asked whether there had been a unanimous recommendation by the committee, whether McAdoo and Baker had approved the bill, and whether there was precedent <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> dollar in honor of a state's centennial (there was not). Wheeler reassured Kitchin as to the unanimity of the committee, and the approval by the officials, but did not answer the centennial question definitively, instead citing instances of prior commemorative issues (the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the Panama-Pacific commemorative coins). Ashbrook intervened, assuring Kitchin that his committee had unanimously approved it. Kitchin had no more questions, and the House approved the bill without a recorded vote.|$|E
5|$|As the British {{came within}} range, the American riflemen opened fire. The American riflemen took {{cover in the}} woods, ravines and even in bends in the road, and each time the British would line up in a battle line, the riflemen would fall back and fire from cover. After Hand was forced to abandon the American {{position}} along Five Mile Run, he took up a new position, a heavily wooded area on the south bank of Shabakunk Creek. Hand deployed his men in the trees where they were so well protected from view that the British could not see them as they crossed the bridge over the stream. The riflemen fired at them from point-blank range. The intense fire confused the British into thinking that the entire American army was up against them and they formed into battle lines, bringing up their cannon. The British searched the woods <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> an hour looking for the Americans, but Hand had already withdrawn to a new position.|$|E

5|$|As third seed, the Raptors played sixth seed New Jersey Nets in {{the first}} round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs. The series drew much media {{attention}} as Vince Carter, a former Raptor who left Toronto under acrimonious circumstances two seasons ago, was now back at the ACC as a Net. In the opening game, while Carter was constantly booed by the home crowd and was not an offensive threat, Toronto's inexperience was evident as they too struggled offensively and were down 65–78 going into the fourth quarter. A late rally by Toronto in the fourth quarter was not enough as they eventually lost 91–96. The Raptors won game 2 89–83 at the ACC to tie the series 1–1, as Bosh recorded 25 points and a game-high 13 rebounds. The Nets won games 3 and 4 to lead 3–1, but Toronto forced a game 6 when they narrowly won 98–96 in game 5. In that game, the Raptors set two post-season franchise records: most number of points going into halftime and biggest lead <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> The attendance for the game was also a franchise record for a playoff game. In game 6, however, New Jersey won 98–97, sealing the series 4–2 and sending Toronto out of the first round.|$|E
5|$|The Fort Vancouver Centennial Corporation {{hoped to}} sell {{commemorative}} half dollars at the planned celebration, and persuaded Representative Albert Johnson of Washington state to introduce {{legislation in the}} House of Representatives. In May 1924, he and Senator Wesley Jones, also of Washington state, introduced legislation in their houses of Congress <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> dollar commemorating the centennial of Fort Vancouver. The bills were not given any hearings. Indiana Representative Albert Vestal, {{the chairman of the}} House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, met with Johnson and persuaded him to introduce a bill for a medal instead. Vestal reasoned that the Treasury Department was opposing more commemorative coin issues, as these were finding their way into circulation and confusing the public. On February 3, 1925, Jones introduced a bill for a medal, and on the 12th, Johnson did the same.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shipment}} of coins, $130,000 in half dollars, arrived by ship on December 9, 1883. Hawaii {{was still in}} an economic recession. A number {{of members of the}} business community, including Sanford B. Dole, objected to the issue on the grounds that so much silver would inflate the currency, and went to court to prevent the government from giving Spreckels bonds in exchange for anything except gold coin, as the law required. The government opposed the action, which was brought in the islands' supreme court, {{on the grounds that the}} silver coins were equivalent to gold. The chief justice, A. F. Judd, granted a temporary writ of mandamus against the government giving the Dole plaintiffs what they wanted, finding that the coins were not equivalent to gold, and that the coinage and loan acts had been violated. On appeal to the full court, though, Judd was reversed, as the court found that Dole and his associates should have filed for an injunction. But when they did, the petition was denied. In the interim at a meeting chaired by the king, the privy council had declared the new coinage a legal tender; once the lawsuit was resolved, the government paid <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> million dollars in coins with a like amount of bonds.|$|E

5|$|The {{trunkline}} {{follows the}} railroad into Antrim and Mancelona. North of downtown Mancelona M-66 turns north toward Charlevoix and US131 continues along the Mackinaw Trail, through Alba. M-32 follows US131 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> mile (0.8km) near {{the community of}} Elmira. As it continues farther north US131 enters the Mackinaw State Forest. Here, MDOT has calculated the lowest average daily traffic counts of all on US131: 5,114cars and 448trucks in 2009. The highway passes through rural Charlevoix County where the terrain has many rolling hills and begins to descend to Lake Michigan. As the highway enters the southern {{section of the city}} of Petoskey it runs along Spring Street passing retail establishments and the Odawa Casino, owned by the Little Traverse Bay Indian Reservation of the Odawa Indians. At the northern terminus of US131, US31 turns off Charlevoix Avenue and follows Spring Street to the north.|$|E

There were recorded games against German teams., a football game in July 1940 was won by Guernsey. Sport also included, cricket, baseball, rugby and in 1940 a church to church walk.|$|E

25|$|Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Qantas {{expressed}} an interest in buying Air New Zealand, Ansett employees planned a staff buy-out, and both SIA and Air New Zealand looked at buying News Limited's 50% share of Ansett. In March 1999 SIA made a formal offer of A$500 million <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> share. Given SIA's industry-leading status, ability to fund Ansett's re-equipment and expansion and global marketing network, industry observers were enthusiastic about the move. However, as part of its original deal to buy TNT's half of Ansett, Air New Zealand had a pre-emptive right to News Limited's half, provided only that it matched or bettered other offers.|$|E

25|$|Medicare {{has been}} in {{operation}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> century and, during that time, has undergone several changes. Since 1965, the provisions of Medicare have expanded to include benefits for speech, physical, and chiropractic therapy in 1972. Medicare added the option of payments to health maintenance organizations in the 1980s. Over the years, Congress expanded Medicare eligibility to younger people who have permanent disabilities and receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments {{and those who have}} end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The association with HMOs begun in the 1980s was formalized under President Clinton in 1997 as Medicare Part C. In 2003, under President George W. Bush, a Medicare program for covering almost all drugs was passed (and went into effect in 2006) as Medicare Part D.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{indications}} since 1996 that Everton {{will move to}} a new stadium. The original plan was for a new 60,000 seat stadium, but in 2000 a proposal was submitted to build a 55,000 seat stadium as part of the King's Dock regeneration. This proposal was unsuccessful as Everton failed to generate the £30million needed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> stake in the stadium project, and the city council rejected the proposal in 2003. Late in 2004, driven by the Liverpool Council and the Northwest Development Corporation, the club entered talks with Liverpool F.C. about sharing a proposed stadium on Stanley Park. However, negotiations broke down as Everton failed to raise 50% of the costs. On 11 January 2005, Liverpool announced that ground-sharing was not a possibility and proceeded to plan their own Stanley Park Stadium.|$|E
25|$|Atkinson {{was born}} in Hull. His only {{appearance}} in the first-class game came against Worcestershire in August 1907 at Bradford's Park Avenue Cricket Ground. Thanks <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> century from G. N. Foster the visitors compiled 155, with Newstead taking 4 for 62, but Atkinson went for 17 runs in three overs. Yorkshire were then routed for 62 in 24.5 overs, Atkinson's duck coming at number 9, courtesy of a catch by Burns from the bowling of Cuffe, who took 4 for 38 in partnership with Arnold (6 for 22). Yorkshire then staged a fightback, bowling Worcestershire out for 28 in 16.2 overs. Newstead was the principal destroyer, taking 7 wickets for just 10 runs. Yorkshire ended the game all out for 91, to lose by thirty runs. Atkinson was stumped by Straw off Cuffe for nought.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Restoration, the Paris Opera was located in the Salle Montansier on rue de Richelieu, where the square Louvois is today. On 13 February 1820, Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry was assassinated {{at the door of the}} opera, and King Louis XVIII, in his grief, had the old theater demolished. In 1820-1821, the opera performed in the Salle Favart of the Théâtre des Italiens, then in the salle Louvois on rue Louvois, and, beginning on 16 August 1821, in the new opera house on rue Le Peletier, which was built out of the material of the old opera house. It was intended to be a temporary home until a new opera house was built; it was neither elegant nor well-located, but it was large and had modern lighting and stage equipment, with gas lights installed in 1822, and the first electrical lighting in 1849. It remained the primary opera venue of Paris <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> century, until the opening of the Palais Garnier.|$|E
25|$|A bill <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> {{dollar to}} commemorate the 150th anniversary of the {{incorporation}} of Hudson {{was introduced in the}} House of Representatives by New York Congressman Philip A. Goodwin on April 6, 1935, and provided for 6,000 pieces. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. Goodwin was the longtime president of the Greene County Historical Society, and introduced the bill as a favor for friends in nearby Hudson. A report was issued by Missouri's John J. Cochran, acting chairman of the committee, on April 2, 1935, recommending that the bill pass with an amendment increasing the mintage to 10,000, and noting that Goodwin had appeared before the committee to pledge that the entire quantity struck would be taken up by the city authorities, thus there would be no coins left on the Mint's hands. On April 3, immediately after the House passed a bill for the Old Spanish Trail half dollar, it passed the bill for the Hudson piece on Cochran's motion, without debate or opposition. The Missouri congressman also included his report in the Congressional Record.|$|E
25|$|If {{it should}} be {{declared}} that contraception is not evil in itself, then we should have to concede frankly that the Holy Spirit {{had been on the}} side of the Protestant churches in 1930 (when the encyclical Casti Connubii was promulgated), in 1951 (Pius XII's address to the midwives), and in 1958 (the address delivered before the Society of Hematologists in the year the pope died). It should likewise have to be admitted that <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> century the Spirit failed to protect Pius XI, Pius XII, and a large part of the Catholic hierarchy from a very serious error. This would mean that the leaders of the Church, acting with extreme imprudence, had condemned thousands of innocent human acts, forbidding, under pain of eternal damnation, a practice which would now be sanctioned. The fact can neither be denied nor ignored that these same acts would now be declared licit on the grounds of principles cited by the Protestants, which popes and bishops have either condemned or at least not approved.|$|E
