25|$|Imitation rubies {{are also}} marketed. Red spinels, red garnets, and colored glass have been falsely {{claimed to be}} rubies. Imitations go back to Roman times and already in the 17th century {{techniques}} were developed to color foil red—by burning scarlet wool in the bottom part of the furnace—which was then placed under the <b>imitation</b> <b>stone.</b> Trade terms such as balas ruby for red spinel and rubellite for red tourmaline can mislead unsuspecting buyers. Such terms are therefore discouraged from use by many gemological associations such as the Laboratory Manual Harmonisation Committee (LMHC).|$|E
25|$|Small {{improvements}} {{continued to}} be made in the first three decades of the 20th century. Foreman's house was moved to make way for burial space in 1890, and a new barn constructed. The road around the chapel was paved with <b>imitation</b> <b>stone</b> to hinder water intrusion into the receiving vault, water pipes were extended into the new burial sites, and several new hydrants installed. The Woodland Avenue gatehouse arch also received a new roof. All four houses, the new barn, the chapel, and the offices were repaired and refurbished in 1893. All the water pipes in the cemetery were replaced, and the houses and offices connected to the sewer system for the first time.|$|E
500|$|The top {{lettering}} is in chalk {{white and}} Greek script that reads [...] "TYΜ.ωΘΕΟC". The last character is deliberately concealed by a chip in the <b>imitation</b> <b>stone,</b> a touch described by Panofsky as a [...] "terminal flourish". This makes {{the meaning of}} the inscription difficult to discern. A general consensus among art historians is that the final character is a square C or sigma sign.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the saris {{were further}} decorated, after weaving, with various sorts of {{embroidery}}. Resham work is embroidery done with coloured silk thread. Zardozi embroidery uses {{gold and silver}} thread, and sometimes pearls and precious stones. Cheap modern versions of zardozi use synthetic metallic thread and <b>imitation</b> <b>stones,</b> such as fake pearls and Swarovski crystals.|$|R

5000|$|Examples of {{simulated}} or <b>imitation</b> <b>stones</b> include cubic zirconia, {{composed of}} zirconium oxide and simulated moissanite, which are both diamond simulants. The imitations copy {{the look and}} color of the real stone but possess neither their chemical nor physical characteristics. Moissanite actually has a higher refractive index than diamond and when presented beside an equivalently sized and cut diamond will have more [...] "fire" [...] than the diamond.|$|R
2500|$|The new Westwood Village {{began to}} open in 1929, {{and one of its}} {{original}} buildings was the Ralphs Grocery Store located on Westwood Boulevard, one block north of Wilshire Boulevard. The store's most prominent feature was its low rotunda, at the corner of Westwood Boulevard and Lindbrook Drive. The building's exterior walls were built with <b>imitation</b> <b>stone,</b> but were later covered with stucco. The building's style has been described as having Mission Revival, Spanish Colonial Revival, Romanesque Revival and Renaissance Revival elements, and is said to have served as a model for other low-rise commercial structures in the village. Early advertising materials for the Westwood Village development featured images of the Ralphs tower and the Janss dome, which became area landmarks. The opening of the store in the fall of 1929 was timed to coincide {{with the opening of the}} UCLA campus, and the Los Angeles Times proclaimed the store [...] "one of the most beautiful exclusive grocery marts in the West." [...] The opening was celebrated with a free food show, as Ralphs boasted a new feature at their Westwood store [...] "the employment of uniformed boys to wrap each purchase of merchandise while it is being paid for at the cashier's stand, and then carry it to the customer's car." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{not long}} ago the proprietors added the room above, called it the Little Rheinschloss, and built in a stairway. Up there was an <b>imitation</b> <b>stone</b> parapet, ivy-covered, and the walls were painted to {{represent}} depth and distance, with the Rhine winding {{at the base of}} the vineyarded slopes, and the castle of Ehrenbreitstein looming directly opposite the entrance. Of course there were tables and chairs; and you could have beer and food brought you, as you naturally would on the top of a castle on the Rhine.|$|E
50|$|The Corinthian columns are {{works by}} Cavaliere Rudolfo Nolli. Nolli also carried {{works for the}} general building, pre-cast works, <b>imitation</b> <b>stone</b> sculptures, artistic decorations, special {{plastering}} and bush-hammered facing works.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{completion}} of the canal, Newhall Street was extended towards it. As the middle classes moved out the area, large factories and workshops were constructed in their place for the goldsmiths and silversmiths. The main gold products being produced at the time were keys, seals and watch chains whilst silversmiths manufactured buckles and comb ornaments using <b>imitation</b> <b>stones.</b> Despite buckles going out of fashion in society, the industry prospered. Jewellery was produced mainly in small workshops, contrasting with the large factories and mills that were constructed in England at the time.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Imitation</b> of <b>stone</b> {{inscriptions}} {{of chopped}} capitals: the font contains only capital letters, numbers, and punctuation. Each size has of the capitals four sizes, {{which can be}} combined, with the little ones functioning as lower case.|$|R
60|$|Sir Thomas {{dabbed at}} his {{forehead}} with his handkerchief. He dared not face the vision of Lady Julia in possession of the truth. At one time, the fear lest she might discover the harmless little deception he had practised had kept him awake at night, but gradually, as the days went by and the excellence of the <b>imitation</b> <b>stones</b> had continued to impose upon her and upon everyone else who saw them, the fear had diminished. But {{it had always been}} {{at the back of his}} mind. Even in her calmer moments, his wife was a source of mild terror to him. His imagination reeled at the thought of what depths of aristocratic scorn and indignation she would plumb in a ease like this.|$|R
50|$|Opened on 6 July 1936, the Fortitude Valley Police Station is a striking, two-storeyed red facebrick {{building}} with contrasting <b>imitation</b> <b>stone</b> dressings to arched entrances and window surrounds {{on the corner}} of Brookes and Wickham Streets, Fortitude Valley.|$|E

50|$|The 1938-39 police barracks {{place has}} {{aesthetic}} value. The patterning of the facades in bands of red facebrick and <b>imitation</b> <b>stone</b> render give the building a lively, defensive quality {{in a style}} reminiscent of the Arts and Crafts movement. The detailing includes decorative terracotta tile panels to the projecting parapet fronts to each elevation and vertical bands of incised arrows to the concrete door surrounds to the north, south and east entrances.|$|E
50|$|The Colosseum {{was built}} {{on the east side of}} Regent's Park, between Chester Terrace and Cambridge Terrace. Designed by Decimus Burton, with the {{assistance}} of John Young it was in the form of a sixteen-sided domed polygon, with a Doric portico. It was built of brick rendered with cement in <b>imitation</b> of <b>stone.</b>|$|R
50|$|More {{expensive}} saris had elaborate geometric, floral, or figurative ornaments or brocades {{created on}} the loom, {{as part of}} the fabric. Sometimes warp and weft threads were tie-dyed and then woven, creating ikat patterns. Sometimes threads of different colours were woven into the base fabric in patterns; an ornamented border, an elaborate pallu, and often, small repeated accents in the cloth itself. These accents are called buttis or bhuttis (spellings vary). For fancy saris, these patterns could be woven with gold or silver thread, which is called zari work.Sometimes the saris were further decorated, after weaving, with various sorts of embroidery. Resham work is embroidery done with coloured silk thread. Zardozi embroidery uses gold and silver thread, and sometimes pearls and precious stones. Cheap modern versions of zardozi use synthetic metallic thread and <b>imitation</b> <b>stones,</b> such as fake pearls and Swarovski crystals.|$|R
5000|$|Work on the {{monument}} began the next January and {{was completed by}} September, 1835. A contemporary newspaper report said: [...] "It is a column nearly sixty feet in height, built of a composition called concrete, in <b>imitation</b> of <b>stone,</b> and the structure, by its correct and elegant proportions, reflects great credit upon the architect, Mr Ranger." ...|$|R
5000|$|The mansion is a {{large wooden}} house in the Georgian style, with <b>imitation</b> <b>stone</b> ashlar facade, built in 1768 by Colonel Jeremiah Lee, {{at that time the}} wealthiest {{merchant}} and ship owner in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. The facade may be based on Plate 11 of Robert Morris' influential patternbook Rural Architecture (London 1750; retitled Select Architecture in later eds.). [...] It was {{one of the largest and}} most opulent houses of the late-colonial period in America.|$|E
50|$|He {{designed}} and painted the frames for his single head portraits {{to look like}} <b>imitation</b> <b>stone,</b> with the signature or other inscriptions giving {{the impression that they}} had been chiseled into the stone. The frames serve other illusionistic purposes; in Portrait of Isabella of Portugal her eyes gaze coyly but directly out of the painting, as she rests her hands {{on the edge of a}} faux stone parapet. With this gesture Isabella extends her presence out of the pictorial space and into that of the viewer.|$|E

50|$|Stamped asphalt is a {{decorative}} product {{which is made}} by transforming regular asphalt into <b>imitation</b> brick, <b>stone,</b> or slate. The process involves {{the creation of an}} impression into an asphalt surface using a combination of heat, a stamping template, and a plate compactor. Creating impressions in the asphalt can be achieved by working behind a paver or reheating the asphalt with reheating equipment.|$|R
50|$|In Surrey Lapidge built Esher Place, a brick house, stuccoed in <b>imitation</b> of <b>stone,</b> with an Ionic portico on each side, for John Spicer. He {{showed a}} view of the garden front of the house at the Royal Academy in 1808.

50|$|The eclectic {{architecture}} of the building combines two principal styles. Colonial Revival styles were very popular for both residential and public buildings when the school was built in 1908. The building's symmetry, proportions, large columned portico, and balustraded roofline are typical of the style. At the same time, the round arches on the upper-story windows and the stone block facade are typical of the Romanesque Revival style that was often employed for substantial public buildings in that period. However, the <b>imitation</b> <b>stone</b> facade is actually formed from carefully rendered concrete blocks—the best example of such craftsmanship in Hawaii.|$|E

5000|$|Christ on the Cross {{with the}} Virgin and Saint John is an {{oil on panel}} painting, later {{transferred}} to canvas, attributed to the Master of the Grimacing St John, {{a senior member of}} the workshop of Jan van Eyck. It was long attributed to Jan's brother Hubert, based on stylistic similarities to portions of the [...] "Adoration of the lamb" [...] passage in the Ghent Altarpiece. The Master of the Grimacing St John is one of only two assistant of van Eyck's whose hand can be identified across several works. He takes his notname from an <b>imitation</b> <b>stone</b> statue in a grisaille diptych wing panel of St. John the Baptist, opposite a Virgin and Child, and is associated with a pen and pencil drawing of St Paul in Vienna.|$|E
50|$|Carter built {{little as}} an architect. A {{significant}} work however was the Catholic chapel at Winchester, commissioned in 1791-2 by the priest John Milner following the Second Relief Act, which allowed the erection of Roman Catholic places of worship, {{on the condition}} that they were without steeples and bells. Entered through a Norman gateway salvaged from a demolished church, the chapel, stuccoed in <b>imitation</b> of <b>stone,</b> had details and furnishings imitated from various Perpendicular models.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} {{situated}} in the western neighbourhood Åby which was formerly a village. The original church constructed of ashlar was built c. 1200 and in the Late Middle Ages it was lengthened towards the west. Two imposts in the chancel arch which were transferred to the new building, {{the one in the}} south is, owing to its cylindrical shape, assumed to be an <b>imitation</b> in <b>stone</b> of a decorated wooden post.|$|R
50|$|The current {{building}} {{was designed by}} William Mason, and was completed in 1856 {{as one of the}} measures taken by Auckland to retain its status as New Zealand's capital. However, the house was used only sporadically after the seat of government was moved to Wellington in 1865. The wooden Italianate mansion endured criticism from architects and lay people alike, many disliked the flat, pasteboard effect of the façade and the dishonest <b>imitation</b> of <b>stone</b> masonry in wood.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} has 30 floors. However, only the southernmost tower [...] "top" [...] is habitable, featuring a two-floor, dual-terraced penthouse. The other tower top houses a water tank, but the floors beneath are habitable. The Eldorado {{was constructed in}} 1929-1931 {{to the design of}} Margon & Holder, for the speculative builder Klosk. The painted metal finials of the towers are a design of Emery Roth, in association with Margon & Holder. [...] "The futuristic sculptural detailing of the El Dorado, as well as its geometric ornament and patterns and its contrasting materials and textures, make it one of the finest Art Deco structures in the city. The towers are terminated by ornamented setbacks with abstract geometric spires that have been compared to Flash Gordon finials," [...] observes Steven Ruttenbaum. Details are cast in <b>imitation</b> <b>stone,</b> and there are bronze panels of low relief. The symmetrical massing of the building, with its terraced setbacks, can be compared to the strikingly similar massing of Roth's classically detailed The Beresford, completed in 1929, months before design of The El Dorado began..|$|E

The prominent tiled hipped roof is interrupted at the street corner and building ends by high narrow parapets with relieved quoining. Built around a courtyard containing a lavatory block and garaging to the rear, the Station is distinguished by a rendered portico entrance below an electric clock and rendered arched timber sash window within the high narrow parapet to the corner and striking rendered arches with prominent scroll keystones to the ground floor timber sash windows to both elevations.Single-height Doric columns flanked by rusticated pilasters beneath a dentilled cornice frame the main corner entrance portico which contains a set of terrazzo stairs and landing. The rusticated rendered arch with a prominent scroll keystone marks the side entrance portico to Wickham Street and is framed by rendered quoining to a high narrow parapet. Wrought iron ornamental grilles are provided to the ground floor street windows and ornamental iron gates to the arched vehicle entrance to Brookes Street. Overlooking Wickham Street from the first floor, an open porch framed by four half-height rendered Doric columns has an elegant, projecting oval balcony with decorative wrought iron balustrading. Bold brackets to lined roof eaves project over the plain flat arched sash windows to the first floor.|$|E
50|$|The {{antechamber}} and {{the chamber}} are completely and perfectly preserved.
