5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Civil War, Austria-Hungary, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland had recognized Finnish independence. The United Kingdom and United States did not approve it; they stood by and followed the relations between Finland and Germany, the main enemy of the Allies, which hoped to override Lenin's regime and get Russia back into the war against the Germans. As to Finland's separation from Russia, Germany hastened <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> get Finland within the German power sphere. France broke off diplomatic relations to the White government of the 1918 war, due to the Whites' co-operation with Germany.|$|E

The amendment was bitterly contested, particularly by the states of the defeated Confederacy, which were forced to ratify <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> regain representation in Congress.|$|E
5|$|The first {{ruler of}} the dynasty, Setnakhte, {{actually}} had two tombs constructed for himself.

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the Vietnamese occupation, the Kampuchean {{resistance}} groups had limited contact with each other due to their differences. Even though the Khmer Rouge enjoyed widespread international recognition, by 1980 the organization was under pressure to reform itself from the international community. ASEAN, which had backed the Khmer Rouge throughout their diplomatic confrontations with the PRK regime at the UN General Assembly in 1979, urged the Khmer Rouge leadership to put its blood-stained image behind <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> join forces with other non-communist movements. However, the idea of forming an alliance with the Khmer Rouge initially caused a certain degree of uneasiness within the leadership circles of the FUNCINPEC and the KPNLF, because both groups were leery about joining with a communist organization well known for its brutality. Nonetheless, early in 1981, Sihanouk and Son Sann began engaging in talks with Khieu Samphan, President of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea, to discuss the prospect of forming an alliance.|$|E

5|$|In {{the end the}} Māoris {{remained}} in position until 17 April. Throughout the previous two days the battalion worked hard to repel repeated attempts by elements of the German 2nd Infantry Regiment to infiltrate their lines, before they finally received the order to fall back. With isolated platoons still {{in contact with the}} Germans and amidst high winds and a heavy downpour of rain, the New Zealanders had difficulty disengaging. Withdrawing over difficult terrain towards the pass, the manoeuvre continued into the night as the Germans continued to harass their rearguard units. The move was carried out with considerable urgency because the intention was to blow a bridge up just after the battalion had withdrawn across <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> delay the German advance. In the end the battalion only just made it, for the engineers tasked with carrying out the demolition had received the order to complete their task and were about to detonate when the battalion arrived shortly after 3:00am.|$|E
5|$|The trailer was {{produced}} and {{made by the}} Glasgow-based Axis Animation, which had previously created trailers for Killzone 2 and Mass Effect 2. According to Stuart Aitken, Axis's Managing Director and Technical Director {{and the director of}} the trailer, Deep Silver gave the team a lot of creative freedom and flexibility in creating the trailer, allowing them to create their own characters instead of using the in-game protagonists. Deep Silver had given them a script and general ideas for them to follow, and the team expanded upon <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> make the trailer feel non-linear and focused, the team decided to narrow down the trailer's location to only a single hotel room. Deep Silver wanted the trailer to have some exterior environment. As a result, the team added a segment which has the daughter falling from the hotel window; in the process, audiences glimpse the island setting.|$|E

While walking his Newfoundland dog in Hyde Park on 6 April 1803 he had an altercation with Colonel Robert Montgomery, when their dogs began fighting. Harsh words were exchanged, and the two parties fought a duel that evening at Chalk Farm. Both men were wounded, the colonel mortally. Macnamara was arrested {{on a charge of}} manslaughter and put on trial at the Old Bailey on 22 April. Macnamara defended himself from the charge on the grounds that he had received an affront and that it was necessary for him to challenge <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> maintain his position as a naval officer. He summoned many of his naval friends, among whom Viscounts Hood and Nelson, Lord Hotham, Sir Hyde Parker, Sir Thomas Troubridge, Captains Martin, Towry, Lydiard, Moore and Waller; and General Churchill and Lord Minto, to testify in his defence. They supported his assertion that he was the 'reverse of quarrelsome' and the jury took ten minutes to acquit him.|$|E
