The best method of establishing <b>fibre</b> <b>flax</b> (c. v.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the economic viability of <b>fibre</b> <b>flax</b> contracting as an alternative activity for field-crop producers in Quebec. A risk-programming model called minimization of total absolute deviation (MOTAD) was developed to better approach this issue. The MOTAD takes into account the variability in income that stems from uncertainty in commodity-market prices and yields. In addition, five different marketing strategies for pricing grain corn and soybeans were included in the model. These pricing techniques combined the use of futures and options markets. In a global agricultural system, where international commitments force governments to cut subsidies, reducing income variability for risk-averse farmers becomes a critical challenge. This study offered to assess the contribution of both contracting and futures markets as alternative market instruments for risk management. Five portfolio farm plans were identified for 200 - and 300 -hectare farm sizes.

The snap point {{was found to}} be present during a restricted period of plant development¿¿the fast growth phase, and to disappear when stem growth was completed. To relate this snap point to bast fiber formation stages, the number of bast fiber cells and the thickness of their cell walls were followed on the stained cross-sections of the flax stem throughout plant development, using the progressing snap point as the reference. The snap point was shown to be the spot, above which the elongation of bast fiber cells is fully completed. This fast growth stage is the period when the maximum length of all bast fibers in the mature plant (a major characteristic of flax fiber quality) is fixed and would not be changed later. Autoradiography was used to visualize the mode of flax bast fiber elongation above the snap point. The even distribution of label was indicative for surface (diffusive) growth type. Elongation of individual fiber cells was estimated to take only 2 ¿ 4 days with a rate of 1 ¿ 2 cm per day, while cell wall thickening occurs mainly below snap point and lasts around 2 months.

However, a lack of significant correlation between fibre and oilseed characteristics in field trials was encouraging and strengthened the hypothesis that breeding dual purpose flax types for western Canada is possible. The study also identified potential recombinant inbred lines (RILs) with enhanced fibre concentration as well as oil characteristics for use in future breeding endeavors. The second study established an anatomical basis for further research into flax fibre improvement by studying differences between the stem anatomy of 14 diverse flax genotypes in the field and under controlled environments such as a growth chamber. The results from the study supported the use of controlled environments for the purpose of quick screening of high fibre containing genotypes, especially at the green capsule stage of plant growth. The results also indicated {{that it was possible to}} select high fibre oilseed flax lines based on anatomical markers such as average area of single fibre cells, total fibre area and fibre to stem area ratio. In the third study, 17 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and 2 cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS) molecular markers were used to assess the extent of genetic variability in the Viking × E 1747 RIL population. CAPS markers LuFAD 3 A and LuFAD 3 B had the highest marker trait association (p < 0. 0001) with linoleic and linolenic acid concentration. SSR markers such as CV 8824, 5 B 6 and LU 32 were found to be associated with plant height, oil concentration and protein concentration respectively using single marker analysis and step wise regression analysis. The molecular study confirmed the importance of Viking × E 1747 mapping population in identifying genes/ markers related to both fibre and oilseed related traits in flax. In the fourth study, global transcript profiling using cDNA - based microarrays was performed to identify differentially expressed fibre related transcripts between Viking and E 1747. The largest group of transcripts (7 %) found more abundant in Viking relative to E 1747 fell under the functional group of cell wall development using gene ontology (GO) analysis. Transcripts such as callose synthases, expansins, cytochrome P 450, fasciclin-like arabino galactan proteins and β-galactosidases were highly abundant in Viking relative to E 1747. The transcripts more abundant in E 1747 relative to Viking were UDP – glucose glucosyltransferase, auxin repressed protein, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, peroxidases and lipid transfer proteins. Quantitative real time PCR results confirmed the suitability of the microarray platform to accurately discriminate transcript profiles between the two diverse flax types. In conclusion, this research has provided a number of new insights into flax fibre genetics. This information lays the foundation for further genetic studies on flax bast fibres and will complement research on developing dual purpose flax varieties...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} quantifies the {{environmental}} impacts of the production of hackled <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> destined for reinforcement of composite materials and compared with those for the production of glass fibres. The ecological advantages of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> production over glass fibres are shown. Most of the environmental indicators used (climate change, acidification, non-renewable energy consumption [...] .) are favourable to <b>flax</b> <b>fibres.</b> However the eutrophication indicator remains high, mainly due to the use and production of fertilizers. Possible optimisation is studied by means of reduction of mechanical extraction steps and chemical products use. A sensitivity analysis highlights that the calculation method used (CML 2000 modified) is robust. The hypothesis of carbon dioxide sequestration influences the climate change indicator. The choice of allocation method, by weight or by economic value, has also a strong influence on {{the environmental impacts}}. Globally, the production of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> appears to be an environmentally attractive alternative to glass fibres...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{cellulosic}} <b>fibres</b> such as <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> present interesting {{mechanical properties}} {{as well as}} biodegradability, and by-products, such as short <b>flax</b> <b>fibres,</b> {{could be used to}} produce geotextiles to stabilise soils. Today, geotextiles are often made of coir fibres, which have a high lignin percentage leading to their slow degradation in soil. Fibres with a high cellulosic content, such as those of flax, exhibit lower resistance to soil degradation. This study investigates solutions to improve this parameter with a view to increasing their service life and therefore their credibility compared to coir fibres for geotextile applications. For this purpose, a cellulose coating of yarns made of short <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> was performed and its stability under a water flow was assessed. The ability to form a cellulose sheath was estimated by chromaticity measurements of <b>flax</b> <b>fibres</b> after applying a dye specific to lignin. Infrared spectrometry analysis to monitor the level of protection against degradation by cellulolytic enzymes was also carried out. It appears that the cellulose coating provides an efficient physical protection, preventing access of these enzymes to their fibrous substrate. Then, the possibility of conferring antibacterial properties on the cellulose coating by chelating phytoalexin molecules such as gramine on it was assayed and proven to be effective against soil cellulolytic bacteria such as Cellvibrio fulvus and Cellvibrio vulgaris. This study therefore establishes that coating flax yarns with cellulose associated with antibacterial molecules could contribute to obtaining a longer service life in soil for geotextiles manufactured from <b>flax</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R
