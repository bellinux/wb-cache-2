40|$|Two {{groups of}} healthy chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were {{experimentally}} exposed to gas supersaturated groundwater. Gross lesions consistent with gas bubble disease (GBD) developed. Vascular lesions associated with intravascular gas bubbles were examined with light and scanning electron microscopy. Dermal blood vessels containing gas bubbles were severely dilated. Additionally, the gas bubbles were spatially associated with endothelial lesions ranging from cellular degeneration to exfoliation. The resulting regions of exposed subendothelial connective tissue were sparsely covered by small unidentified adherent cells and strands of fibrin. In {{the light of}} these findings, the similarities in vascular pathology between GBD in fish and <b>decompression</b> <b>disease</b> in man are discussed, {{particularly with respect to}} the initiation of haemostatic disorders in both conditions.

40|$|This thesis {{mentions}} the basic physiological and physical principles of diving, {{it deals with}} diseases and injuries {{that occur in the}} connection with diving. The diseases are divided according to the phase of the diving as follows: The diseases originating from the change of surrounding pressure, diseases connected with staying in the depth and diseases stemmed after emersing above the surface of the water. Deeply elaborated chapter about <b>Decompression</b> <b>disease</b> includes a scale of predispositioning factors to this disablement. Next it mentions diseases that are not connected with the change of surrounding pressure. This part of my thesis describes the different forms of poisoning by enhaled gases, infectious diseases, drowning, hypothermia, hypoxia and it also includes an extended chapter that deals with sea animals and their potentional danger for human organism. The work also references to some preventive processes which can minimalize the risks of occurence of these diseases and injuries...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that blood bubbles may be {{detectable}} and there is ultrasonic evidence of acute interstitial lung edema even after diving without protocol violation. Macrophages {{play a central role}} in the inflammation, and macrophage polarization is closely related to the pathogenesis some lung diseases. Available findings indicate that decompression may induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules in the blood and tissues, which are associated with the macrophage polarization, and hyperbaric treatment may exert therapeutic effects on <b>decompression</b> related <b>diseases</b> via regulating these factors. Thus, we hypothesize that the polarization of circulating and/or resident macrophages is involved in the pathogenesis of decompression induced lung injury...|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{branches}} of the aorta that supply the anterior spinal artery, the most common causes are insufficiencies within the aorta. These include aortic aneurysms, dissections, direct trauma to the aorta, surgeries, and atherosclerosis. Acute disc herniation, cervical spondylosis, kyphoscoliosis, damage to the spinal column and neoplasia all could result in ischemia from anterior spinal artery occlusion leading to anterior cord syndrome. Other causes include vasculitis, polycythemia, sickle cell <b>disease,</b> <b>decompression</b> sickness, and collagen and elastin disorders.|$|R
40|$|Gas-bubble lesions were {{described}} in cetaceans stranded in spatio-temporal concordance with naval exercises using high-powered sonars. A behaviourally induced <b>decompression</b> sickness-like <b>disease</b> was proposed as a plausible causal mechanism, although these findings remain scientifically controversial. Investigations into the constituents {{of the gas}} bubbles in suspected gas embolism cases are highly desirable. We have found that vacuum tubes, insulin syringes and an aspirometer are reliable tools for in situ gas sampling, storage and transportation without appreciable loss of gas and without compromising {{the accuracy of the}} analysis. Gas analysis is conducted by gas chromatography in the laboratory. This methodology was successfully applied to a mass stranding of sperm whales, to a beaked whale stranded in spatial and temporal association with military exercises and to a cetacean chronic gas embolism case. Results from the freshest animals confirmed that bubbles were relatively free of gases associated with putrefaction and consisted predominantly of nitrogen...|$|R
5000|$|Orbital <b>decompression</b> for Grave's <b>Disease.</b> Grave's Disease is a {{condition}} (often associated with over-active thyroid problems) in which the eye muscles swell. Because the eye socket is bone, there is nowhere for the swelling to be accommodated {{and as a result}} the eye is pushed forward into a protruded position. In some patients this is very pronounced. Orbitial decompression involves removing some bone from the eye socket to open up one or more sinuses and so make space for the swollen tissue and allowing the eye to move back into normal position.|$|R
40|$|Surgery for {{congenital}} {{heart disease}} is now often performed in {{the first months of}} life because mortality is higher and myocardial damage more serious in unoper-ated children or those undergoing delayed surgery. Fetal cardiac intervention may prove a logical extension and has been proposed for fetuses with critical semilunar valve stenosis or atresia. Early ventricular <b>decompression</b> may halt <b>disease</b> progression, alter the natural history and improve postnatal outcomes either by preserving a two-ventricle circulation or by improving the outlook for single-ventricle candidates because of a healthier myocardium and pulmonary bed. Without intervention, fetuses with a closed interatrial septum may develop circulatory failure resulting in hydrops and intrauterine death, whereas i...|$|R
40|$|Background : Cervicothoracic {{junction}} Tuberculous Spondylitis or Pott’s Disease {{especially in}} children are extremely rare. In this case report, we report a further case to this rare entity. Case : A twelve-year-old {{boy with a}} history of kyphosis deformity and long tract signs was presented in paraparesis condition. Spine MRI shows severe cervicothoracic junction canal compromise due to severe bone destruction. One-stage laminectomy decompression and stabilization fusion via posterior approach was performed. In the follow-up period, the patient showed remarkable improvement of all neurological deficits. Conclusion : Two-stage surgery via anterior and posterior approach are recommended; otherwise, it would be uncertain stability. However, in this report we would like to emphasize that not all unstable diagnosis of Pott’s disease leads to circumferential stabilization. Longer level of instrumented spine segment and multilevel of osteotomies may account for adequate kyphotic correction and <b>decompression</b> for this <b>disease.</b>  </p...|$|R
5000|$|Active sonar, the {{transmission}} equipment used on some ships {{to assist with}} navigation, is detrimental {{to the health and}} livelihood of some marine animals. Research has recently shown that beaked and blue whales are sensitive to mid-frequency active sonar and move rapidly away from the source of the sonar, a response that disrupts their feeding and can cause mass strandings. [...] Some marine animals, such as whales and dolphins, use echolocation or [...] "biosonar" [...] systems to locate predators and prey. It is conjectured that active sonar transmitters could confuse these animals and interfere with basic biological functions such as feeding and mating. Study has shown whales experience <b>decompression</b> sickness, a <b>disease</b> that forces nitrogen into gas bubbles in the tissues and is caused by rapid and prolonged surfacing. Although whales were originally thought to be immune to this disease, sonar has been implicated in causing behavioral changes that can lead to decompression sickness.|$|R
40|$|Although {{percutaneous}} endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) {{has become}} a popular method for long-term tube feeding worldwide, {{there are only a}} few reports about its application in Taiwan. From May 1997 to May 2005, we performed 302 PEG insertions successfully in 310 attempts (97. 4 % success rate) using modified Ponsky's pull method with 24 -Fr feeding tubes. All the patients received PEG for tube feeding except for two patients with cancerous peritonitis for <b>decompression.</b> The underlying <b>diseases</b> in these 308 patients who received PEG for tube feeding were 161 cerebrovascular accidents (52. 3 %), 62 head and neck cancers (20. 1 %), 21 cases of Parkinsonism (6. 8 %), and others. There were 11 major complications (3. 6 %) and 57 minor complications (18. 9 %). Ten patients (3. 3 %) died within 30 days after PEG insertion. However, no procedure-related mortality occurred. In conclusion, PEG is an effective method for tube feeding and drainage with a high success rate. PEG insertion was often indicated for patients with dysphagia caused by cerebrovascular accident, head and neck cancer, and Parkinsonism in Taiwan. It is a relatively safe procedure, with a 3. 6 % rate of major complications and 18. 9 % rate of minor complications...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this {{retrospective}} follow-up study is to evaluate the prevalence of patients with thyroid eye disease presenting with apparent unilateral proptosis and determine the occurrence of exophthalmos in contralateral non-proptotic eye over the time. Associated features with this event were evaluated. Methods. A cohort of 655 consecutive patients affected by thyroid eye disease with a minimum follow-up of 10 years was reviewed. Exophthalmos was assessed by using both Hertel exophthalmometer and computed tomography (CT). The influence of age, gender, hormonal status and of different therapies such as corticosteroids, radiotherapy and surgical <b>decompression</b> on this <b>disease</b> progression was evaluated. Results: A total of 89 patients (13. 5 %) (95 % confidence interval [CI] 15 %- 10 %) had clinical evidence of unilateral exophthalmos at the first visit. Among these, 13 patients (14 %) (95 % CI 22 %- 7 %) developed subsequent contralateral exophthalmos. The increase of protrusion ranged from 2 to 7 mm (mean of 4. 2). The time of onset varied from 6 months to 7 years (mean time: 29 months). Smoking status, young age and surgical decompression are significantly associated with development of contralateral proptosis (p<. 05). Conclusions: Asymmetric thyroid eye disease {{with the appearance of}} unilateral exophthalmos at the initial examination is a fairly frequent event, while subsequent contralateral proptosis occurs less commonly. However, physicians should be aware that young patients, particularly if smokers, undergoing orbital decompression in one eye may need further surgery on contralateral side over time...|$|R
40|$|Conservative {{treatment}} is ineffective for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) in the thoracic spine, and surgical {{treatment is}} indicated for most cases, while such cases are not often experienced. In the present study, {{the results of}} surgical management involving mainly posterior <b>decompression</b> for this <b>disease</b> were evaluated clinically. The study included 9 patients (1 man and 8 women) who underwent surgical treatment for OPLL of the thoracic spine between 1984 and 1993. Laminectomy was performed in 5 patients, and laminectomy plus anterior decompression of the OPLL via the posterior approach based on Otsuka's method was performed in 2 patients. In 1 patient, laminoplasty for OPLL of the cervical spine was combined with laminectomy of the symptomatic lesion in the thoracic spine. One patient underwent anterior decompression and fusion. The results were evaluated using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score (JOA score) and recovery rate. The postoperative follow-up period ranged from 1 year to 10 years and 3 months (mean, 4 years and 6 months). The mean JOA score was 4. 8 before surgery and improved to 7. 6 at the final examination. This was a mean recovery rate of 50. 1 %. Symptoms caused by OPLL in the thoracic spine can be alleviated by posterior decompression where OPLL extends from the upper to the middle thoracic spine or extends from the middle to the lower thoracic spine. It seems, however, that OPLL localized to the middle thoracic spine requires anterior decompression. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{commercial}} fishing with crab pots {{on the physical}} condition of the snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) and southern Tanner crab (C. bairdi) were investigated in the Bering Sea and in Russian waters of the Sea of Okhotsk. In crabs that were subjected to pot hauling, the presence of gas embolism and the deformation of gill lamellae were found in histopathological investigations. Crab vitality, which was characterized subjectively through observation of behavioral responses, depended on not only the number of pot hauls but also the time between hauls. Immediately after repeated pot hauls at short time intervals (≤ 3 days), we observed a rapid decline in vitality of crabs. When hauling intervals were increased to > 3 days, the condition of crabs did not significantly change. After repeated pot hauls, concentration of the respiratory pigment hemocyanin ([Hc]) was often lower in the hemolymph of crabs than in the hemolymph of freshly caught animals. Our research indicated that changes in [Hc] in crabs after repeated pot hauls were caused by the effects of decompression and not by starvation of crabs in pots or exposure of crabs to air. We suggest that the decrease in [Hc] in hemolymph of snow and southern Tanner crabs {{was a response to}} the adverse effects of <b>decompression</b> and air-bubble <b>disease.</b> The decrease in [Hc] in affected crabs may be a result of mechanisms that regulate internal pressure in damaged gills to optimize respiratory circulation...|$|R
