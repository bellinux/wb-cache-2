40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the freezing point (Tf) of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fish burger using the cooling curve and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method. Cooling curves were obtained for two household refrigerators, a freezer with no quick freeze function and another one equipped with a quick <b>freeze</b> <b>compartment.</b> <b>Freezing</b> point, freezing time and freezing rates were determined from the cooling curves. The freezers showed slow freezing rates ranging from 0. 10 to 0. 40 cm/h. The quick freeze function improved the freezing process, as it significantly reduced the freezing times by significantly increasing freezing rates. Tf of the tilapia fish burger was (− 2. 7 ± 0. 1) °C and no significant difference between freezing rates and the DSC method was observed. This investigation demonstrated that the cooling curve method using a simple experimental apparatus and domestic refrigerators can be used to measure freezing point of high moisture foods...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Knowledge {{spillover}} on {{advanced technology}} {{is thought to}} be one of the most significant measures for encouraging regional industries as well as forming regional industrial cluster. However, in many rural areas, it is not easy to produce spillover itself because of lack of effective knowledge source and lack of capability of surrounding regional enterprises for utilizing spilled out knowledge/technology, in addition to the difficulty of forming an effective industrial cluster. The case researched here is one successful example of local business on lily bulbs, in Kochi. Kochi is a warm, mild climate, rural area in Japan, suitable for growing lily bulbs. However, one problem for this industry was the difficulty to ship/grow lily bulbs in winter because lily bulbs cannot be cropped in cold seasons. The company’s unique idea was to import lily bulbs to Japan, located in the north hemisphere, from some countries in the southern hemisphere by using freezing containers and large <b>freezing</b> <b>compartments</b> and ship the bulbs to the flower farmers after warming them up. By this measure, they could monopolize the winter bulb market in Japan. This case implies us significance of finding a competitive business model in rural regions. Here, global collaboration is one very important element to find such a business model. Even by using conventional technology (what we call low-tech), not by using advanced technology (high-tech), regional industries can be effectively encouraged by adapting technologies to such a suitable business model...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{refrigeration}} {{is a new}} environmentally benign {{technology and}} a promising alternative to conventional vapor-cycle refrigeration. Among these technologies the household refrigerator without a <b>freezing</b> <b>compartment</b> shows very good prospects for a successful application. This article starts with the general principle of magnetic refrigeration and then also describes the maximum specific cooling capacity of magneto caloric materials. The specific cooling power of a magnetocaloric material {{is found to be}} large even for medium magnetic field changes, especially if the frequency is not too small. For a domestic magnetic refrigerator, a comparison with a standard compressor refrigerator is presented. The modeling of a rotary magnetic refrigerator is described and its dynamic behavior is investigated. The physical model is based on a mapping of the magneto-thermodynamic problem from a cylinder onto two rectangles. In this model, in a basic centre cell, two coupled linear partial differential equations are solved, which have been programmed in the Modelica language. Steady-state solutions are envisaged to determine the coefficient of performance, COP, for these conditions. In future work the developed model shall be applied for an optimization of the magnetic refrigerator and to determine the related best parameters...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{refrigeration}} has {{the potential}} to substitute as a future technology conventional refrigeration systems- with often problematic refrigerants- in several niche markets or even some main markets of the refrigeration domain. Based on this insight the Swiss Federal Office of Energy has demanded a division at the University of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland (HEIG-VD) in Yverdon-les-Bains to list all possible refrigeration technologies and to evaluate the potential of magnetic refrigeration for these specific applications. The HEIG-VD researchers have developed a calculation tool to determine the coefficient of performance (COP) values and the exergy efficiency as a function of magnetic field strength and rotation frequency of rotary types of magnetic refrigerators. The considered machine design is based on a patent, which was deposited by these scientists. Based on this work, it is found that two applications are very interesting for a first possible investigation, namely the household refrigerator without a <b>freezing</b> <b>compartment</b> and the central chilling units, which may be of large size. The COP values of such large-scale systems are very high. At present a study, if even superconducting magnets, applying high-temperature superconductivity, could be an economic solution, is performed. The final report of this project will answer this question. It will also present the applied evaluation method in more detail than this brief annual report...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of nodular hyperplasia of the suprarenal cortex {{and the development}} of mammary tumors in dba mice ovariectomized at birth have been reported by us in a short paper (1). Since then further data have been secured which enable us to follow the suprarenal changes from their earliest manifestation to the fully formed abnormalities and correlate these with the changes taking place in the vagina, uterus, and mammary glands. The observations are based on data collected from 95 dba female mice which were ovariectomized at birth and killed at different ages. This particular strain has about 50 per cent breast tumor incidence in the virgin females. Method The ovariectomy was performed on the first post partum day. The mice were anesthetized by chilling. They were placed on a sheet of paper in the <b>freezing</b> <b>compartment</b> of an electric refrigerator for about 7 minutes. Small dorsal incisions were made and each ovary, together with its capsule and part of the oviduct, was removed. A dissecting microscope was used to aid in locating these organs. Each incision was closed by one stitch taken with fine white silk thread. The mice survived the operation well, and their mothers readily accepted and continued to take care of them. At the autopsy of every animal a careful search was made to ascertain whether any ovarian regeneration had taken place. All suspicious areas were sectioned but in no case was ovarian regeneration found. Changes in the Suprarenal Gland In all the castrated animals killed after 3 to 4 months of age the suprarenals show characteristic changes which progressively lead to the {{formation of}} nodular hyperplasia. Most of the glands were studied on serial sections. The earliest changes consist of the hypertrophy of a few cells of the zon...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Gelişen teknoloji, modernleşme ve bununla birlikte insan ihtiyaçlarının değişmesi, yeni ürünlerin ortaya çıkmasına neden olmuş, piyasadaki rekabeti arttırmıştır. İnsanoğlunun çeşitli etkenlerden dolayı gün içerisinde kendine yeterli zamanı ayıramamaya başlamış, bu durum üreticilerin pazar paylarını artırabilmeleri için yeni ürünler ortaya çıkarmalarına zemin hazırlamıştır. Üreticiler, piyasaya sundukları ürünlerde, günlük hayatta karşılaşılabilecek zorluklara pratik çözümler üretmeye başlamışlardır. Buzdolabı, günümüzde sadece yiyecekleri taze tutma fonksiyonunu yerine getiren bir ürün olmaktan çıkmıştır. Buz kırma, su sebili, şoklama v. b. fonksiyonlar tüm buzdolaplarda bulunabilen özelliklerdir. Günümüzde kullanıcılar, buzdolaplarından farklı fonksiyonları yerine getiren donanımlar beklemeye başlamışlardır. Dondurma yapan bir cihazın buzdolabına entegrasyonu projesi bu amaçla ortaya çıkmıştır. Dondurma, özellikle yaz aylarında serinlemek amacıyla tüketilen bir yiyecektir. Bu yiyeceğin hazırlanması için eskiden kol gücüne ihtiyaç duyulurken, günümüzde bir motor tarafından tahrik edilen sistemler kullanılmaktadır. Dondurma hazırlama işleminde karıştırma yapılırken, miksin soğutulması gerektiği aşikardır. Bundan yola çıkılarak, dondurmanın buzdolabı içerisinde yapılabileceği düşünülmüştür. Buzdolabı içerisinde dondurma yapma fonksiyonu, buzdolabının freezer kısmında bulunan soğuk havadan yararlanarak, dondurma yapımına imkan tanıyan bir uygulamadır. Dondurma pazarının dünyada ve ülkemizde giderek büyüdüğünü düşünürsek, ortaya çıkacak ürünlerin büyük ilgi uyandıracağı öngörülmektedir. Piyasada; büyük hacimlerde dondurma yapımını mümkün kılan endüstriyel dondurma yapma makineleri olduğu gibi, ev ortamında herkesin dondurma yapmasına olanak sağlayan dondurma yapma makineleri de bulunmaktadır. Temel işlevi itibariyle, endüstriyel ve ev tipi solo dondurma yapma makineleri arasında fark bulunmamaktadır. Endüstriyel olanların farkı, daha büyük soğutma sistemi ve daha güçlü ve yüksek mukavemetli tahrik grubuna sahip olmalıdır. Çalışmada, buzdolabı içerisinde dondurma yapımının olabilitesi araştırılarak, farklı tasarımlar ve konstrüksiyon alternatifleri geliştirilmiştir.

Farklı tasarımlar oluşturularak, en iyi alternatifin belirlenebilmesi için çeşitli kriterlere göre puanlandırılmıştır. Daha sonra en iyi alternatif tasarım detaylandırılmış, sistem fonksiyonunu yerine getiren çalışır bir prototip üretilmiştir. Son olarak, prototip testleri yapılarak, ürün geliştirme için tavsiyelerde bulunulmuştur. Development of the {{technological}} issues, modernization, {{changing of the}} mankind’s demands induced arising of new products. In addition to this, it affects {{the challenge of the}} household market. Because of the fast improving technology, humans couldn’t spent enough time to their personel requirements. This situation arises new products and apparatus for ordinary devices for people demands made by many companies. This companies produces many practical solutions for tough conditions which makes peoples lives harder. At present, the refregirator device not only store food and drinks fresh, but also it has ice maker for makes small ice cubes from bulk ice, water found for supplying water which is desirable temparature and freezing function for food products spoiled quickly. After, demandings are getting bigger time to time, the users require new products or qualifications to accept new functions in household devices. The combination of the ice cream maker and refregirator avokes due tothe impact of this conditions. Ice cream, mainly contains milk, cream, water, low fat dry milk powder, oil for regulating the mix, materials for colouring the mix. Blending and adding different ratio and types of the contents, using physical and chemical solutions form ice cream products. Also, this products include protein, carbonhydrate, calcium, phosphor, magnesium, ferrous and zinc and they have called a nutritive value product. For some references, ice cream forms the ice cream mix pasteurized and cooled by cold fresh air and solidfied in long hours. In this part, said ice cream mix; the combination of milk proteins, sugar, corn sorbet, water, egg and egg products, stabilizator which ise useful for humans health and emulgator. When we look up the consumption of the ice cream, the demanding products depend on the change of the local settlements and the products of this local areas. In this meaning, there are vary of ice cream product for different kinds of taste. The most known, pure ice cream, has low fat and milk with vanilla which is absolutely necesary for the mix. Outline of these contents, the mix doesn’t content any additive or aroma. In chocolate ice cream includes, except for ingredients of pure ice cream, % 3 ratio of cacao and % 1 more sugar. According to local demands, fruit ice cream includes milk which has between % 15 and % 18 ratio of fat, between % 10 and % 15 ratio of fruit particles, fruit sorbet or aroma. With the combination of the ice cream maker and refregirator study aims to make ice cream products for benefit freezer compartment in refregirator device. In household market, the challenge is getting more strict and the companies produces new products, so they upgrade their product variety. In this fact, the food which desires and consumes in every states, like ice cream, prepared in house for users, is the key target for the household companies. Said companies invest a small part of fortune to research and development projects and making these devices which is located household products. In addition to investment, they barely endeavor to pass the projects into real life. The another aim of the investment; increasing the apparatus of the devices and making variety of functional systems in there. When we have looked last 5 years, both the world and Turkiye, the ice cream has fast growing sales values, the market rivalry has gotten strict and the more manufacturing companies are avoked in these time. Eventually, a device which is making this successful product in refregirator compartment, not only improve the functionality of the refregirator, but also it brings this products to foreground in household sector. The other objective of the project is to contribute to producing healthy ice cream products; to prove the capability of making ice cream products liked by people all around the world at their homes. In the market; most of fast consuming ice cream products includes many artificial materials which is called consistency accelerator or regulator. These materials affect human’s health and they accumulate the body and cause cancer. The combination of the ice cream maker and refregirator project is maintained by Arcelik Structural Design Management Department. In this project, product benchmark studies, the detection of reference ice cream products, the design of the alternative concepts, evaluation of the concepts and selection of the best, the study of prototyping, tructural analysis, structural reconstraints according to the analysis, testing of ice cream recipes, sensorial tests are sustained by the same department. The selection of the refregirator which contains ice cream maker devices and the critical terms of cooling, thermodynamic and physical parameters of the refregirator is completed by the assistance of the Arcelik Eskisehir Refregirator Plant. After the prototype was occured, the ice cream samples were tested in Arcelik Nourishment Laboratories. In addition, thanks to Arcelik Research and Development Thermodynamic Department, helps us to understanding refregirator cooling system and characteristic of working style. In the market, {{there are two types of}} devices used to making ice cream products. They are; • Industrial ice cream makers and coolers • Home made ice cream makers Industrial ice cream makers used in demanding high production of the ice cream, also it produces a great deal of products. Moreover, their cooling systems are more complicated than home made devices. Home made ice cream makers are smaller than industrial devices. It makes about one liter ice cream at one time. These devices are seperated two groups. The home made ice cream makers in first group, has only a motor and receptacle which has to took in refregirator freezer compartment about 13 hours before making ice cream. The devices in second group has own cooling systems. It also has compressor, condenser, evaparator and the pipes carried cooling liquid. In these devices, you could make ice cream in 90 minutes. In spite of the fact that it is very quick, the ice cream product made by the device has many ice particles and the mixture gets softer at the center. Consequently, it is not homogeneous and this is the main problem which has to solve in new products. Eventually, In this study, we researched the probability of the making ice cream in the refregirator <b>freezing</b> <b>compartment</b> and we tried to find new solutions about cooling the system, rotating the mixer etc. Then we designed different, alternative concepts. In benchmark stage, we investigated the most popular and successful home made ice cream devices in the market and optimized the system, determined the correct power system and transmission group. We are choosing the correct design showed up by evaluation of different criterias. After this, we design the correct alternative system with every components and we made a prototype accomplished the main function of the ice cream maker system. Finally, we tested the protype and advised the qualifications which makes the device the most useful. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
