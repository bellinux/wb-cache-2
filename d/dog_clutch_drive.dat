5000|$|The WD Big 4 was a {{development}} of prewar trials outfit with a sidecar wheel coupled to the motorcycle rear wheel through a <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> and <b>drive</b> shaft. Initial trials {{were carried out}} at Studland in Dorset and it coped well with challenging terrain. The simple design also meant {{it was easy to}} maintain in the field. All three 18" [...] X 4.00 wheels were interchangeable with various makes of tyres for off road use.|$|R
50|$|From 1913 the Duo was {{available}} {{with an extra}} chain driven countershaft with two gears and <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> before the <b>drive</b> went to the variable pulley arrangement, so that gear ratios extended from 4:1 to 16:1. The price went up with the change from 97 guineas to 106 guineas. In the Cyclecar Club's fuel economy competition the three Duos equipped with Lukin, Stewart-Precision and Solex carburettors recorded fuel consumptions of 40.3, 50.7 and 53.1 miles per gallon respectively.|$|R
50|$|In the 3 years {{leading up}} to 1913 William Brough had been {{developing}} a flat-twin engine in-line with the frame. It was very similar to the ABC engines of that period. This 497cc engine had overhead valves, 70mm bore and 64.5mm stroke, and had a magneto fitted above and a 2-speed gearbox below. By the end of 1914 it had replaced all other engines in the Brough range, and using it only 3-models were planned for 1915. The three models were the HS - which was fitted with a two-speed countershaft gear operated by <b>dog</b> <b>clutches,</b> with chain <b>drive</b> to the gearbox, and John Bull rubber belt drive to the rear wheel over an adjustable pulley allowing the top gear range to be varied. No clutch or kick-start was provided. The second model was the HB, which was fitted with a Sturmey-Archer 3-speed hub gearbox and handle starter. The third model was the HTT, which was very similar to the HS but fitted with a specially tuned engine with high-compression, lightweight steel pistons, different camshafts, and special front cylinder lubrication.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dog</b> <b>clutches</b> {{are used}} where slip is {{undesirable}} and/or the clutch {{is not used}} to control torque. Without slippage, <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> are not affected by wear {{in the same way}} that friction clutches are.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dog</b> <b>clutches</b> {{are used}} inside manual {{automotive}} transmissions to lock different gears to the rotating {{input and output}} shafts. A synchromesh arrangement ensures smooth engagement by matching the shaft speeds before the <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> is allowed to engage.|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{performed}} {{in order to}} improve the curvic coupled engagement of a <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> situated in the transfer case of a truck. The <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> is used to engage the so called all-wheel-drive system of the truck. If the driver tries to engage the all-wheel-drive when truck’s rear wheels already skid, due to a slippery surface a relative rotational speed in the <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> will occur. This relative rotational speed will cause the <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> to bounce back of itself before engagement, or to not engage at all. The <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> has been redesigned to prevent this. Dynamic simulations using MD Adams have been made for the existing model, for the models created in previous works, and for the new model in order to figure out which of them will show the most stable engagement, at high relative rotational speed. The implemented simulations show that better results can be obtained. Separation into two parts of the disc pushed by the fork, shows that <b>dog</b> <b>clutch’s</b> engagement is faster and more stable, comparing to the original model and the other created models. The new model shows better coupling in the whole range of the relative rotational speed from 50 up to 120 rpm...|$|R
50|$|The {{slipper clutch}} {{consists}} of two bases, one with <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> and ramps with ball bearings, a splined hub, and clutch plates. In normal operation, the <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> mate, driving the transmission. When a back torque comes from the transmission, the splined hub slides up the bearing ramps, disconnecting from the clutch plates and allowing a limited slip between input and output.|$|R

50|$|The {{installation}} of these engines was somewhat unorthodox, necessitated by the limited funds for new work. The rear engine was started first by compressed air starting, then the front engine was started through a mechanical friction clutch. Once synchronised, they were locked {{together with a}} <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> for the record attempt. The car's last run was a demonstration circuit at Brooklands, running at slow speed on only one engine, with this <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> disconnected.|$|R
5000|$|The now {{ubiquitous}} constant-mesh gearboxes, {{which can}} include non-synchronised, or synchronized/synchromesh systems, where typically diagonal cut helical (or sometimes either straight-cut, or double-helical) gear sets are constantly [...] "meshed" [...] together, and a <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is used for}} changing gears. On synchromesh boxes, friction cones or [...] "synchro-rings" [...] are used {{in addition to the}} <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> to closely match the rotational speeds of {{the two sides of the}} (declutched) transmission before making a full mechanical engagement.|$|R

50|$|Some {{clutches}} are {{not designed}} to slip; torque may only be transmitted either fully engaged or disengaged to avoid catastrophic damage. An {{example of this is}} the <b>dog</b> <b>clutch,</b> most commonly used in non-synchromesh transmissions.|$|R
5000|$|The reverse turbine had 4 rows of blades. It {{was engaged}} by a <b>dog</b> <b>clutch,</b> {{activated}} when the reverser lever {{was set to}} [...] "0". This was originally steam-operated by a small piston and cylinder.|$|R
50|$|A {{good example}} of a simple <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> {{can be found in}} a Sturmey-Archer bicycle hub gear, where a sliding cross-shaped clutch is used to lock the driver {{assembly}} to different parts of the planetary geartrain.|$|R
50|$|Among many {{different}} types of <b>clutches,</b> a <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> provides non-slip coupling of two rotating members. It is not at all suited to intentional slipping, in contrast with the foot-operated friction clutch of a manual-transmission car.|$|R
40|$|Normally {{the trucks}} with {{four wheel drive}} option will be running in rear wheel drives and the front wheels will be {{rotating}} freely. In extreme tough driving conditions, the risk for getting stopped or slipping the rear wheels in mud is high. When the driver tries to engage the four wheel drive option and due to the difference in relative rotational speed of the <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> parts, {{there is a risk}} for slipping off or bouncing back of the <b>dog</b> <b>clutch.</b> After studying the importance of gear geometry and a few parameters, the team ended up with a new design and the performance of the design found satisfactory when simulated in MSC ADAMS...|$|R
5000|$|In contrast, newer [...] "constant mesh" [...] {{transmissions}} use gears {{that are}} held axially, but gears on one shaft spin freely on the shaft. Gear pairs in the transmission {{are always in}} mesh, though at most one is engaged at any time. Each free-spinning gear has a <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> which is engaged by an axial sliding collar that transfers power to the shaft. The <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> may be plain, also called [...] "non-synchromesh", or may use an additional synchromesh mechanism that helps get the parts moving {{at the same speed}} to assist engagement. Many constant mesh transmissions use a sliding-mesh gear for reverse, but since reverse is only engaged from near a stop, it is still easy to engage.|$|R
50|$|In {{the typical}} manual gearbox for a RWD car, the driving shaft (input) is in-line with the driven shaft (output), but not {{permanently}} connected to it. A reduction gear on the driving shaft drives the layshaft. In car transmissions, the term countershaft is also used. A {{number of gears}} on the layshaft may then be connected, one at a time, to the driven shaft. Selecting each of these gears in turn gives the various ratios of the gearbox. All of these gear ratios are reduction gears, the engine speed being higher than the input speed to the final drive of the rear axle. Early gearboxes used sliding gears to engage and disengage the drive. These were difficult to operate and also wore on the main working surfaces of the gears. An early improvement was to use separate <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> instead to engage gears, leaving the gears themselves in 'constant mesh'. A later, and more gradual development, was the introduction of synchromesh. This is an all-metal friction clutch {{in addition to the}} positive <b>dog</b> <b>clutch,</b> that gradually engages the gears and matches their speed before the <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> engages.|$|R
5000|$|In {{process of}} manufacturing, {{a lot of}} changes were {{introduced}} in ER9p construction. Starting with ER9p-125 train, jaw <b>clutch</b> <b>drive</b> <b>clutch</b> is changed by rigid roll.

50|$|The clutch that mates {{the engine}} to the {{transmission}} in a modern manual-shift automobile is a friction clutch whose disc and pressure plate are smooth; they lock up simply through friction. However, some kinds of clutches (including those inside an automatic transmission) may lock up via the engagement of dogs, rather than only through friction. These <b>clutches</b> are called <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> and the <b>dogs</b> used within them are called <b>clutch</b> <b>dogs.</b>|$|R
50|$|A form of {{transmission}} brake is commonly fitted to automatic transmissions. These brakes use a <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> or pawl system, rather than friction linings. They thus provide {{a simple and}} positive lock when stationary, but cannot (or at least, should not) be engaged when moving.|$|R
50|$|A {{constant-mesh}} transmission {{offers several}} advantages over a sliding-mesh design. First, the <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is designed for}} the task, rather than asking the gear to do dual duty of power transmission and sliding engagement. Second, the <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> is typically smaller in diameter than the gear it controls, so absolute speeds of the engaging parts are lower, aiding engagement. Thus, while a non-synchromesh transmission still relies on the operator to match speeds, gears are easier to engage. Third, a constant-mesh transmission can easily use helical gears which are smoother, quieter, and can carry more torque for a given size of gear. Fourth, a constant-mesh transmission can use synchromesh for easier shifting; while many heavy vehicle transmissions do not use it, most medium- and light-duty automotive transmissions do.|$|R
50|$|Locking {{the output}} shaft with a gear is {{achieved}} {{by means of a}} <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> selector. The <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> is a sliding selector mechanism which is splined to the output shaft, meaning that its hub has teeth that fit into slots (splines) on the shaft, forcing that shaft to rotate with it. However, the splines allow the selector to move {{back and forth on the}} shaft, which happens when it is pushed by a selector fork that is linked to the gear lever. The fork does not rotate, so it is attached to a collar bearing on the selector. The selector is typically symmetric: it slides between two gears and has a synchromesh and teeth on each side in order to lock either gear to the shaft.|$|R
5000|$|In engineering, a dog {{is a tool}} or part of a {{tool that}} {{prevents}} movement or imparts movement by offering physical obstruction or engagement of some kind. It may hold another object in place by blocking it, clamping it, or otherwise obstructing its movement. Or it may couple various parts together so that they move in unison - the primary example of this being a flexible drive to mate two shafts in order to transmit torque. Some devices use <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> to lock together two spinning components. In a manual transmission, the <b>dog</b> <b>clutches,</b> or [...] "dogs" [...] lock the selected gear to the shaft it rotates on. Unless the dog is engaged, the gear will simply freewheel on the shaft.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With {{the help}} of the {{orthogonal}} experiment and the friction-wear mechanism by car as the research object of the <b>clutch</b> <b>driven</b> platen friction plate of Chongqing Changan CX 20 auto power take-off installation, the optimization of clutch friction materials is studied. It was selected for the resin-base fiber materials of <b>clutch</b> <b>driven</b> platen to be commonly used in auto mechanical manufacture. It was analyzed for the abrasion mechanism of the <b>clutch</b> <b>driven</b> platen friction plate between the flywheel and the pressure plate,and discussed for the relationship of driven platen friction-plate heat recession-performance and the driven plate material at high temperature. The results show that the friction factor of the optimized driven platen lining materials do not change. In the process of the frequent friction heating to high temperature, the stability of the optimized driven platen lining materials is strong, the wear of those is reduced, and the optimized driven platen lining materials have good performance of high temperature-thermal recession...|$|R
50|$|A <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is a type}} of clutch {{that couples}} two {{rotating}} shafts or other rotating components not by friction but by interference. The two parts of the clutch are designed such that one will push the other, causing both to rotate at the same speed and will never slip.|$|R
5000|$|Greatly {{simplified}} single-revolution clutches {{were developed}} in the 20th century, requiring much smaller operating forces and in some variations, allowing for a fixed fraction of a revolution per operation. [...] Fast action friction <b>clutches</b> replaced <b>dog</b> <b>clutches</b> in some applications, eliminating the problem of impact loading on the dogs every time the clutch engaged.|$|R

40|$|A tool {{comprises}} a first {{handle and}} a second handle, each handle extending from a gripping end portion to a working end portion, the first handle having first screw threads disposed circumferentially about an inner portion of a first through-hole at the working end portion thereof, the second handle having second screw threads disposed circumferentially about an inner portion of a second through-hole at the working end portion thereof, {{the first and second}} respective through-holes being disposed concentrically about a common axis of the working end portions. First and second screw locks preferably are disposed concentrically with the first and second respective through-holes, the first screw lock having a plurality of locking/unlocking screw threads for engaging the first screw threads of the first handle, the second screw lock having a plurality of locking/unlocking screw threads for engaging the second screw threads of the second handle. A locking <b>clutch</b> <b>drive,</b> disposed concentrically with the first and second respective through-holes, engages the first screw lock and the second screw lock. The first handle and the second handle are selectively operable at their gripping end portions by a user using a single hand to activate the first and second screw locks to lock the locking <b>clutch</b> <b>drive</b> for either clockwise rotation about the common axis, or counter-clockwise rotation about the common axis, or to release the locking <b>clutch</b> <b>drive</b> so that the handles can be rotated together about the common axis either the clockwise or counter-clockwise direction without rotation of the locking <b>clutch</b> <b>drive...</b>|$|R
50|$|All-indirect {{were used}} for some very early cars, before the {{advantages}} of the direct-drive top gear were recognised. They contain no dog clutches; at the time, gear changing was still carried out by sliding the gears in and out of mesh. Once the <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> came into use, the further advantage of a direct-drive top gear was immediately recognised.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of joint between shell and arbor {{involves}} a fairly large cylindrical feature at center (to locate the shell concentric to the arbor) and two driving lugs or tangs that drive the shell with a positive engagement (like a <b>dog</b> <b>clutch).</b> Within the central cylindrical area, one or several socket head cap screws fasten the shell to the arbor.|$|R
50|$|In a {{synchromesh}} gearbox, {{to correctly}} match {{the speed of}} the gear to that of the shaft as the gear is engaged the collar initially applies a force to a cone-shaped brass clutch attached to the gear, which brings the speeds to match prior to the collar locking into place. The collar is prevented from bridging the locking rings when the speeds are mismatched by synchro rings (also called blocker rings or baulk rings, the latter being spelled balk in the U.S.). The synchro ring rotates slightly due to the frictional torque from the cone clutch. In this position, the <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> is prevented from engaging. The brass clutch ring gradually causes parts to spin at the same speed. When they do spin the same speed, there is no more torque from the cone <b>clutch</b> and the <b>dog</b> <b>clutch</b> is allowed to fall into engagement. In a modern gearbox, the action of all of these components is so smooth and fast it is hardly noticed.|$|R
