40|$|Objective: <b>Hypertensive</b> <b>disorders</b> in {{pregnancy}} are major causes of maternal mortality and morbidity. Although the combined risk assessments of maternal history, blood pressure, uterine artery Doppler, and maternal serum marker {{seem to be}} highly predictive {{of the development of}} <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders,</b> this method is a little complicated to be performed on many low-risk pregnant women. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the use of maternal characteristics, and physical findings early in the second trimester, as predictive factors of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders.</b> Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study undertaken in a single tertiary care center in Japan. Singleton pregnant women without underlying disease and evaluated before 14 weeks of gestation were included. We conducted multivariate logistic regression analysis and decision tree analysis to elucidate the potential risk factors of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders,</b> including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Results: In total, 1986 women were evaluated, of whom 863 were nulliparous and 1123 were multiparous, and 166 (8. 3 %) were diagnosed with <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders.</b> In multivariate analysis, maternal age ≥ 40 years, prepregnancy BMI ≥ 30  kg/m 2, in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET), family history of hypertension, and blood pressure ≥ 130 / 85  mmHg at first visit were independent risk factors for the nulliparous women. Maternal age ≥ 40 years, a history of previous <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders,</b> and blood pressure ≥ 130 / 85  mmHg at first visit were independent risk factors for the multiparous women.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} serum alpha-fetoprotein and uric acid levels on pregnancy outcome in late pregnancy women with <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorder.</b> Methods: One hundred and twenty-six cases of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorder</b> complicating pregnancy were rolled into the observation group, and 80 healthy pregnant women were rolled into the as control group. The relationship between serum alpha-fetoprotein and uric acid levels and adverse pregnancy outcomes were compared between the two groups. Results: Compared with the control group, the serum levels of AFP and serum uric acid were significantly higher in the observation group, and the differences were statistically significant (P< 0. 01). In the observation group, {{with the increase of}} blood pressure, the serum AFP and uric acid levels were increased, which in the moderate sub-group and severe sub-group were significantly higher than those in mild subgroup, and the severe sub-group was significantly higher than that in the moderate sub-group (all P< 0. 05). The rate of preterm birth, premature rupture rate, placental abruption rate, fetal distress rate and cesarean section rate in the pregnant women with abnormal serum AFP and uric acid level were significantly higher than that of the normal serum AFP and uric acid group (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: The serum AFP and uric acid levels in the late pregnancy women with <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorder</b> are significantly higher than those of the normal pregnant women, and are elevated remarkably as the blood pressure rising.

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldOBJECTIVE: To investigate {{if there is an}} increased risk for recurrence of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorder</b> in pregnancy with a new partner and whether this is affected by maternal age and the interbirth interval through use of familial material. METHODS: Data on 614 multiparous women, with confirmed de novo <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorder</b> in a first pregnancy, were used to assess the effect of paternity and interbirth interval on recurrence of hypertensive disorders. RESULTS: There were 121 women (19. 7 %) who had changed partner. Recurrent hypertension occurred in 318 women (64. 5 %) with the same partner and in 75 women (62 %) with a new partner. The odds ratio (OR) for recurrence with the same partner was 1. 115 (95 % CI 0. 739 - 1. 680) and with a new partner 0. 897 (95 % CI 0. 595 - 1. 353). The mean interbirth interval was longer for women with recurrent hypertension (4. 9 vs. 4. 0 years, p = 0. 0002). The OR for developing recurrent <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorder</b> was 1. 154 (95 % CI 1. 049 - 1. 269) for every interval year with the same partner and 1. 145 (95 % CI 0. 958 - 1. 368) with a new partner after correction for maternal age. CONCLUSION: In women with a positive family history and previous hypertension in pregnancy, change of paternity does not influence the risk of recurrence. Increasing interbirth interval may account for a 15 % recurrence risk for each year, independent of maternal age.

40|$|PURPOSE: Prior {{studies of}} the {{association}} between physical activity and risk of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders</b> of pregnancy have been conflicting, failed to assess total physical activity, and included few Hispanic women, the largest minority group in the United States with the highest birth rates. METHODS: We examined this association among 1043 participants in the Latina Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Study, a prospective cohort of predominantly Puerto Rican prenatal care patients conducted from 2000 to 2004 in western Massachusetts. Physical activity before and in early pregnancy was assessed by bilingual interviewers using {{a modified version of}} the Kaiser Physical Activity Survey. RESULTS: Fifty women (4. 8 %) were diagnosed with <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders</b> of pregnancy and 30 (2. 9 %) with preeclampsia. In multivariable analyses, there was a statistically significant trend of decreasing risk of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders</b> with increasing sports/exercise in early pregnancy (P(trend) = 0. 04). High levels of early pregnancy active living activity (odds ratio (OR) = 0. 4, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 1 - 1. 1, P(trend) = 0. 07) and household/care giving activity (OR = 0. 4, 95 % CI = 0. 1 - 1. 3, P(trend) = 0. 07) were associated with a 60 % reduction in risk of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders</b> relative to low levels; however, these associations were of marginal statistical significance. High levels of total physical activity (OR = 0. 3, 95 % CI = 0. 1 - 1. 0, P(trend) = 0. 06) in early pregnancy were associated with a 70 % reduction in the risk of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders</b> relative to low levels; however, this association was also of marginal statistical significance.

40|$|Background: <b>Hypertensive</b> <b>disorders</b> {{represent}} {{the most common}} medical complications of pregnancy with a reported incidence between 5 and 10 %. The disorders are major causes of maternal and perinatal morbidities and mortalities. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the pattern and outcomes of pregnancies complicated by <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders.</b> Methods: Hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted on all mothers who gave birth in the labor ward of Jimma University Specialized Hospital from April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010. Data was collected by interviewing the mothers and review of their medical records using structured questionnaire and checklist, respectively. Data analysis was performed using SPSS for windows version 16. 0. Result: Majority (52. 5 %) of the mothers were in the age group of 25 - 34 years. The overall prevalence of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders</b> of pregnancy was 8. 5 %. Severe preeclampsia accounted for 51. 9 % of the cases followed by eclampsia (23. 4 %). Residential area of the mothers (urban/rural) was found to have statistically significant association with severity of the disorder. Most (66. 5 % and 74. 7 %) of the mothers were nulliparous and had antenatal care follow-up during the index pregnancy, respectively. Antenatal care follow-up and parity had no statistically significant association with severity of the disease. The case fatality rate of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders</b> of pregnancy was 1. 3 % with perinatal mortality of 317. 1 / 1000 births.

40|$|Women {{who have}} {{experienced}} a placental abruption have a risk of recurrence, but exact information to quantify this risk is currently not available. We studied the incidence and recurrence rate of placental abruption in a subsequent pregnancy {{and the influence of}} hypertensive disorders. We conducted a retrospective national cohort study of all singleton pregnancies that ended from 1999 - 2007 in the Netherlands. A longitudinal linked national cohort of these women with information on a subsequent singleton delivery was used. We calculated and compared incidence and recurrence rates of placental abruption for women in total, stratified by gestational age of first placental abruption and by the presence of a <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorder</b> in their first pregnancy. We studied 1, 570, 635 women of which 3496 (0. 22 %) experienced a placental abruption. Information was available on a subsequent singleton delivery for 264, 424 deliveries. Of these, 521 women (0. 20 %) had a placental abruption in the first pregnancy vs 214 women (0. 08 %) in the second pregnancy. The risk of placental abruption in a subsequent pregnancy was significantly higher in women with a previous placental abruption compared with women without (5. 8 % vs 0. 06 %; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 93; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 62 - 139). Women with a placental abruption that occurred at term in their first pregnancy were more at risk for recurrence (aOR, 188; 95 % CI, 116 - 306) than women with a preterm (aOR, 52; 95 % CI, 25 - 111) or early preterm (< 32 weeks of gestation) placental abruption in their first pregnancy (aOR, 39; 95 % CI, 13 - 116). Placental abruption was more frequent among women with a <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorder</b> compared with normotensive women (0. 44 % vs 0. 16 %; odds ratio, 2. 7; 95 % CI, 2. 3 - 3. 3).

Overweight (odds ratio, 1. 82) and weight gain (odds ratio, 2. 20) were related to recurrence among women with gestational hypertension.

CONCLUSION: Recurrence of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders</b> in pregnancy is common, but not specified by type of disorder in first pregnancy. Overweight and weight gain between pregnancies are associated with recurrent <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders</b> in pregnancy in women with gestational hypertension. Early onset of hypertension is a risk factor, independent of body weight...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of folic acid and vitamin {{supplement}} on endothelial injury and placental blood perfusion in patients with <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorder</b> complicating pregnancy. Methods: A total of 62 patients who were diagnosed with preeclampsia in Wuhan Red Cross hospital between March 2015 and February 2017 were selected as the research subjects and randomly divided into two groups, the observation group received folic acid, vitamin and conventional symptomatic treatment, and control group accepted conventional symptomatic treatment. Serum contents of endothelial injury markers and oxidative stress indexes were detected before treatment and 2 weeks after treatment; the expression of apoptosis genes in the placenta were detected after delivery. Results: 2 weeks after treatment, serum ET- 1, tTG, sFlt- 1, sEng, MPO, IMA, MDA and AOPP levels of both groups of patients were significantly lower than those before treatment, and serum ET- 1, tTG, sFlt- 1, sEng, MPO, IMA, MDA and AOPP levels of observation group were significantly {{lower than those of}} control group; after delivery, Fas, Bax and Caspase- 3 mRNA expression levels in placenta tissue of observation group were significantly lower than those of control group while Bcl- 2, Survivin and Livin mRNA expression levels were significantly higher than those of control group. Conclusion: Folic acid and vitamin supplement can significantly improve the endothelial injury and placental blood perfusion in patients with <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorder</b> complicating pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Formerlypreeclam-ptic {{women with}} a subnormalplasma volume (PV) have an {{increased}} risk to develop a <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorder</b> in a subsequent pregnancy as compared to women with normal P V. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that formerly preeclamptic women who develop recurrent disease in their next pregnancy differ from their counterparts with an uneventful next pregnancy by a lower pre-pregnant PlV a lower venous capacitance, smaller rises in these indices in early pregnancy, a lower renal adaptive response, and a lower response to mild exercise. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 33 formerly preeclamnptic women in this study. Only 14 conceived within the study perioduwith seven of them developing a recurrent <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorder</b> in their next pregnancy (RECUR), while seven had an uneventfiul next pregnancy (NORA 41). Before pregnancy and at 12 weeks tfgeestational age, we compared the following variables between these subgroups: PV, venous capacitance, effective renal plasma flow (ERPF, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and the responses in stroke volume (S V 1) and heart rate (HR) to mild exercise. To estimate venous capacitance, we infused 500 inL of a inodifledgelatine solution in 30 minutes while recording the change in cardiac output (pulse contour analysis). The ratio ofpercent change in blood volume to percent change in cardiac output {{in response to a}} standardized small volume load provides an estimatefor venous capacitance...|$|E
40|$|Preeclampsia is a <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorder</b> {{that occurs}} during pregnancy. It has an unknown {{etiology}} and affects approximately 5 – 8 % of pregnancies worldwide. The pathophysiology of preeclampsia {{is not yet}} known, and preeclampsia has been called “a disease of theories. ” The central symptom of preeclampsia is hypertension. However, the etiology of the hypertension is unknown. In this review, we analyze the molecular mechanisms of preeclampsia with a particular focus on the pathogenesis of the hypertension in preeclampsia and its association with the renin-angiotensin system. In addition, we propose potential alternative strategies to target the renin-angiotensin system, which is enhanced during pregnancy...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveHypertensive {{disorders}} in pregnancy are major causes of maternal mortality and morbidity. Although the combined risk assessments of maternal history, blood pressure, uterine artery Doppler, and maternal serum marker {{seem to be}} highly predictive {{of the development of}} <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders,</b> this method is a little complicated to be performed on many low-risk pregnant women. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the use of maternal characteristics, and physical findings early in the second trimester, as predictive factors of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders.</b> Materials and MethodsThis is a retrospective cohort study undertaken in a single tertiary care center in Japan. Singleton pregnant women without underlying disease and evaluated before 14 weeks of gestation were included. We conducted multivariate logistic regression analysis and decision tree analysis to elucidate the potential risk factors of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders,</b> including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. ResultsIn total, 1986 women were evaluated, of whom 863 were nulliparous and 1123 were multiparous, and 166 (8. 3 %) were diagnosed with <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders.</b> In multivariate analysis, maternal age ≥ 40 years, prepregnancy BMI ≥ 30  kg/m 2, in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET), family history of hypertension, and blood pressure ≥ 130 / 85  mmHg at first visit were independent risk factors for the nulliparous women. Maternal age ≥ 40 years, a history of previous <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders,</b> and blood pressure ≥ 130 / 85  mmHg at first visit were independent risk factors for the multiparous women. According to the decision tree analysis, high-risk populations were as follows: women ≥ 40 years old who conceived thorough IVF-ET and women with prepregnancy BMI ≥ 30  kg/m 2 who conceived spontaneously in nulliparous women; women with a history of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders</b> and women with blood pressure ≥ 130 / 85  mmHg in the absence of the previous history. ConclusionThe combination of maternal background and physical findings is useful to identify the population with a high risk of <b>hypertensive</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R
