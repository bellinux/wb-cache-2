25|$|The two, at {{the extreme}} of their rivalry, {{climbing}} the road wrapped like a ribbon round the majestic volcano, terribly steep, in parallel action... I've always been convinced that in these moments that supreme player of poker, the Norman , used his craftiness and his fearless bluffing to win his fifth Tour. Because, to me, {{it was clear that}} Anquetil was at the very limit of his strength and that had Poulidor attacked him repeatedly and suddenly then he would have cracked... Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too big a gear, which stopped his jumping away, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.|$|E
500|$|... "Sparks Fly" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised Swift's vocals on [...] "Sparks Fly", commenting that her voice {{in such an}} upbeat song is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer. Rahul Prabhakar of The Oxonian Review considers it [...] "dopamine-infused, hair-whipping stuff". Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine calls the song [...] "the purest iteration of Swift’s template and repertoire", also saying that it [...] "could turn things around for Swift, as it’s perhaps the most perfectly constructed single in a career built on tracks that are marvels of pop production and songwriting." [...] He concluded by stating that the song [...] "proves how evocative those turns-of-phrase {{can be in the}} right context. To that end, “Sparks Fly” plays as a template as much as it does as a standalone single, and it’s a testament to everything Taylor Swift gets right." [...] Bobby Peacock of Roughstock claims that he gets [...] "a sense that Taylor is starting to experience a little [...] burnout at radio. Her songs drop like rocks once they peak, and she's currently 0 for 3 on hitting the top of the Billboard charts. While I don't think this song has that je ne sais quoi to get her another 'You Belong with Me'-level [...] hit, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> even a slightly lesser effort from her is a worthwhile listen." [...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 praised Swift, saying [...] "Her infusion of individual lines with urgency (“Drop everything now,” she insists) and earnestness (“Take away the pain,” she pleads) are a tribute to her talent, {{not so much as a}} distinguished vocalist but as an excellent communicator. Each frazzled note is freighted with meaning. Should I stay or should I go now?, she wonders, [...] away the hours before he calls her again." [...] Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country claimed the song is [...] "just another one of those so-Swift tracks that continually toes the line between country and pop to create a genre that is 100% Taylor Swift." [...] Erin Thompson of Seattle Weekly stated he wasn't to [...] "hot on" [...] the song and compared the song to Swift's earlier works, [...] "Fearless", [...] "Hey Stephen", and [...] "Forever and Always", and stated that Swift [...] "puts in a line about standing in the rain in so many of her songs that I'm beginning to think she watches The Notebook every time she gets ready to sit down and write a song." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin considered it a bubbly tune along with Swift's song, [...] "Long Live".|$|E
5000|$|His final {{show was}} on Friday, 16 February 2001, and before signing off, he said: [...] "One {{of the reasons}} I'm {{not going to do}} a DLT is that I've nothing to {{complain}} about at all - though as I'll still be employed by the BBC it'd be a stupid thing to do. I always thought as a kid working at Radio 1 would be the most fun and the best place for any presenter to work and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> true."His final track played on BBC Radio 1 was Ace of Spades by Motörhead.|$|R

2500|$|The {{results of}} the study were {{politically}} sensitive, since a heavy death toll could raise questions regarding the humanitarian justifications {{on the eve of a}} contested US presidential election. Critics objected to the timing of the report, claiming it was hastily prepared and published despite what they perceived as its poor quality in order to sway the U.S. electorate. On this topic, Les Roberts stated [...] "I emailed it in on Sept. 30 under the condition that it came out before the election. My motive in doing that was not to skew the election. My motive was that if this came out during the campaign, both candidates would be forced to pledge to protect civilian lives in Iraq. I was opposed to the war and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the war was a bad idea, but I think that our science has transcended our perspectives." ...|$|E

60|$|So {{that was}} my visit to Sir Thomas Rossiter, the famous beetle-hunter, and that was also my first step upon the ladder of success, for Lady Rossiter and Lord Linchmere {{have proved to be}} staunch friends, and they have never {{forgotten}} my association with them in the time of their need.

60|$|But the Portuguese {{things are}} {{suspected}} by M. Cartailhac, (who, however, again {{admits that he}} has been credulously incredulous before,) as well as by M. Reinach. The things ought to be inspected in themselves. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> they are on parallel lines with the work of the Clyde forger, who may have read about them in A Vida Moderna 1895, 1896, in Archeologo Portugues, in Encyclopedia dar Familiar, in various numbers, and in Religioes da Lusitania, vol. i. pp. 341, 342, (1897), a work by the learned Director of the Ethnological Museum of Portugal. To these sources the Dumbuck forger may have gone for inspiration.|$|E

That sudden snowstorm was the real cause of our victory, and, {{had it not been}} for that, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we could not have succeeded. The Russian cannon certainly continued to fire, but it was wholly at random, and they were taken by surprise when we suddenly appeared at the side of the ditch, while we were across before they could gather any force sufficient to defend it.|$|E
60|$|I {{began my}} own {{studies on the}} subject with works much earlier than Robinson Crusoe, and made my way {{through a variety of}} novels which were {{necessary}} for my purpose, but which in the reading gave me no pleasure whatever. I never worked harder than at the Arcadia, or read more detestable trash than the stories written by Mrs. Aphra Behn; but these two were necessary to my purpose, which was not only to give an estimate of the novels as I found them, but to describe how it had come to pass that the English novels of the present day have become what they are, to point out the effects which they have produced, and to inquire whether their great popularity has on the whole done good or evil to the people who read them. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the book is one well worthy to be written.|$|E

"Upon {{the other}} hand, you will {{probably}} make some enemies by your interference with the plans of some unscrupulous young noble, and Venice is not a healthy city {{for those who have}} powerful enemies; <b>still</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the advantages will more than balance the risk.|$|R

60|$|I gained much by my {{delay in}} {{publishing}} from about 1839, when the theory was clearly conceived, to 1859; and I lost nothing by it, for I cared very little whether men attributed most originality {{to me or}} Wallace; and his essay no doubt aided in the reception of the theory. I was forestalled in only one important point, which my vanity has always made me regret, namely, the explanation {{by means of the}} Glacial period of the presence of the same species of plants and of some few animals on distant mountain summits and in the arctic regions. This view pleased me so much that I wrote it out in extenso, and I believe that it was read by Hooker some years before E. Forbes published his celebrated memoir ('Geolog. Survey Mem.,' 1846.) on the subject. In the very few points in which we differed, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I was in the right. I have never, of course, alluded in print to my having independently worked out this view.|$|E
60|$|The laymen of the Church {{have here}} a {{question}} before them, {{on the answering}} of which, as I still think, many others attend. If the Established Church could throw off its lethargy, and give the Dissenters some speaking token of its zeal for union, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> union, to some extent, would be the result. There is a motion tabled (as I suppose all know) for the next meeting of the General Assembly; but something more than motions must be tabled, and something more must be given than votes. It lies practically with the laymen, by a new endowment scheme, to put the Church right with the world in two ways, so that those who left it {{more than thirty years}} ago, and who may now be willing to return, shall lose neither in money nor in ecclesiastical status. At the outside, what will they have to do? They will have to do for (say) ten years what the laymen of the Free Church have done cheerfully ever since 1843.|$|E
60|$|From a child I {{was fond}} of reading, and all the little money that came into my hands was ever laid out in books. Pleased with the Pilgrim's Progress, my first {{collection}} was of John Bunyan's works in separate little volumes. I afterward sold them to enable me to buy R. Burton's Historical Collections; they were small chapmen's books, and cheap, 40 or 50 in all. My father's little library consisted chiefly of books in polemic divinity, most of which I read, and have since often regretted that, {{at a time when}} I had such a thirst for knowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way since it was now resolved I should not be a clergyman. Plutarch's Lives there was in which I read abundantly, and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> time spent to great advantage. There was also a book of De Foe's, called an Essay on Projects, and another of Dr. Mather's, called Essays to do Good, which perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that had an influence on some of the principal future events of my life.|$|E
5000|$|When the Lowell {{city council}} voted {{to create a}} park in honor of Jack Kerouac, Fleming voted against naming the park after Kerouac. [...] "I didn’t <b>think,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> don’t <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> this {{particular}} person {{would be the best}} example for our children," [...] Fleming said. [...] "And there were other people who we could have voted for, like (Air Force commander) Hoyt Vandenberg — he came from Lowell — or Bette Davis.
