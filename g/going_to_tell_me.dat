2500|$|Sanchez {{recently}} {{stated that}} with the Coheed and Cambria saga completely chronicled on the group's first five albums, he has been contemplating the direction of future releases. [...] "I've thought of telling stories {{of the future and}} stories of the past, maybe getting involved more in the story of Sirius Amory (sic – Sirius Amory in the stories), the fellow who figured out the value of the Keywork," [...] he said. [...] "Or even stories that kind of parallel the one that we’re telling. It’s kind of up in the air. I’ve started writing music for that next record, and I'm kind of hoping that maybe in doing that it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> which one to do.” ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{the start}} of the series, the lack of a {{relationship}} with her father serves as motivation for Erica's actions. She {{is an example of the}} Nixon staple of the [...] "lost daddy's girl." [...] Eric abandons her and her mother before {{the start of}} the show, when Erica is nine years old. As a result, she develops a severe abandonment complex. Since Eric leaves his family for a successful career in Hollywood, Erica also longs for a life of fame and a successful man. This motivation is maintained in the character decades into the series. [...] "Susan added a lot of Erica's background," [...] Behr said. [...] "Rather than playing it as if Erica's just a rotten character, she added the pathos of this child who was deserted by her father. Every time she did a scene about how 'My father loves me. I know that he loves me and nobody is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> differently,' she colored it with the knowledge that she had really been deserted. It worked so well that the writers reached the point where they said we have to play this out." [...] In 1989, the Eric Kane character makes his first appearance as Erica goes in search of him and finds him working as a clown at a circus. She attempts to help him out of his current circumstances, but he ends up betraying her and leaving Pine Valley.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> on <b>me,</b> and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I'll be whipped, and I never was whipped in school." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Aline {{is a good}} girl," [...] Louise said, smiling, [...] "but hot-water taps and {{electric}} lights are more to her than sunshine and hills. Do you know," [...] she went on, [...] "I feel like a child being led through an undiscovered country, a land of real adventures. Which way are we going, {{and what are we}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see? <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> please!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> you've been occupying your leisure {{in writing}} poetry? That's a most {{improper}} proceeding {{in a hospital}} patient." ...|$|E
60|$|CAESAR (seating himself beside her, in {{the most}} amiable of tempers). Just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} about you. You shall hear it. Proceed, Pothinus.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well for a tale," [...] Ellen replied, [...] "but you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that he's come into these ways naturally." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Sphinx {{seemed to}} find heart to smile. [...] "Of course, I'm ridiculous. But I do hope we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be friends. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> about yourself. Or, have some more tea!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a selfish}} pig I am!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Anyhow, it's all over now. We'll {{go back to}} Luigi's to supper, by all means. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all about that young man from Bath!" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{was aware}} of Godolphin {{fretting}} at the colloquy he could not interrupt, and of Mrs. Harley prolonging it wilfully. [...] "I know you are sincere, and I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> everything you object to in me when it's over. Will you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't look so ashamed," [...] he said, smiling faintly. [...] "I'm {{not afraid}} of him. What is it you were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, my lady?" [...] I {{thought she}} was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> her dreams, but no, when she spoke next it was only to ask a question.|$|E
6000|$|Was he {{referring}} to Eustace? And {{was he going}} to do what he would have done in my husband's place?--was he really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> the truth? ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{hurt her}} a little; {{but when he}} said, [...] "I think that the blessings of St. Andrew's Day helped us through what was to follow," [...] she owned that it had indeed been so, and added, [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work again! <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> what will be most useful to you at Cocksmoor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{you said}} a moment ago," [...] he observed, [...] "the staff of Peaceful Moments is taking big risks. I knew it before you told me. I have had {{practical}} demonstration of the fact. And that is why this Broster Street thing {{has got to be}} finished quick. We can't afford to wait. So I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> this man's name right now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! did you indeed, sir? Then why didn't you ask me, {{the moment}} we came out? The confidences of lovely women {{are not to be}} slighted. However, I forgive you this once, and look here, Pa; that's'--Bella laid the little {{forefinger}} of her right glove on her lip, and then laid it on her father's lip--'that's a kiss for you. And now I am <b>going</b> seriously <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you--let <b>me</b> see how many--four secrets. Mind! Serious, grave, weighty secrets. Strictly between ourselves.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No you won't. That drink was {{for you if}} {{you went}} ashore. If you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> the island, you must do it in your sober senses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Caddy," [...] said Mrs. Jellyby, pausing for {{a moment}} in her {{occupation}} and then serenely pursuing it after shaking her head, [...] "you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> some nonsense." ...|$|E
60|$|ANNA--[With a laugh.] There you go kiddin' again. [Then {{seeing his}} hurt expression--quickly.] But you was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about yourself. You're Irish, of course I can tell that.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know better! I saw {{you on the}} train--you an' them other fellers, too!" [...] And Sol Blugg pointed unsteadily at Phil and Roger. [...] "I {{know how}} it is," [...] he went on, ramblingly. [...] "You went there in place o' Abe--queered the hull thing fer us, you did! I know! You're in with Abe, an' Abe's in with you! Thought you'd do us out o' our little game, eh? Say, Larry!" [...] he called to {{the man on the}} sidewalk. [...] "Look at these three fellers--same ones was on the train last night.

Wot are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that now, what are we goin' to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless you, it hasn't," [...] rumbled Ellen. [...] "The day {{never goes}} by {{for men and}} nations to make asses of {{themselves}} and take to the fists. The millenniun isn't THAT near, Mr. Meredith, and YOU don't think it is any more than I do. As for this Kaiser, mark my words, he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make a heap of trouble"--and Miss Ellen prodded her book emphatically with her long finger. [...] "Yes, if he isn't nipped in the bud he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make trouble. WE'LL live to see it--you and I will live to see it, Mr. Meredith. And who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> nip him? England should, but she won't. WHO is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> nip him? <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> that, Mr. Meredith." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't bear this, Harry! You mock at everything, {{and then}} suggest {{the most serious}} tragedies. I am sorry I told you now. I don't care what you say to me. I know I was right in acting as I did. Poor Hetty! As I rode past the farm this morning, I saw her white face at the window, like a spray of jasmine. Don't let us talk about it any more, and don't try to persuade me that the first good action I have done for years, the first little bit of {{self-sacrifice}} I have ever known, is really a sort of sin. I want to be better. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be better. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> something about yourself. What {{is going on in}} town? I have not been to the club for days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh! I knew that," [...] {{retorted}} Jenny Wren. [...] "What do {{you suppose}} my eyes are make for? I thought you were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> something I didn't know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray don't!" [...] she begged. [...] "You are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> are you," [...] she added, {{looking at}} me with wide-open eyes, [...] "that I have {{accepted}} you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And, afther all, are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> now, that I may jist go my own way? Is {{that to be}} your answer, and all I'm to {{get from}} you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 21. I {{have just}} {{received}} your letter, which I will not answer now; God be thanked {{all things are}} so well. I find you have not yet had my second: I had a letter from Parvisol, who <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> he gave Mrs. Walls a bill of twenty pounds for me, {{to be given to}} you; but you have not sent it. This night the Parliament is dissolved: great news from Spain; King Charles and Stanhope are at Madrid, and Count Staremberg has taken Pampeluna. Farewell. This is from St. James's Coffee-house. I will begin my answer to your letter to-night, but not send it this week. Pray <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> whether you like this journal way of writing.--I don't like your reasons for not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Trim. Parvisol <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> he can sell your horse. Sell it, with a pox? Pray let him know that he shall sell his soul as soon. What? sell anything that Stella loves, and may sometimes ride? It is hers, and let her do as she pleases: pray let him know this by the first that you know goes to Trim. Let him sell my grey, and be hanged.|$|R
6000|$|Ludlow {{went off}} to speak to Mrs. Westley of {{something}} he saw her looking at; Charmian edged nearer to Cornelia. [...] "I would give {{the world to be}} in your place. I never saw anything like it. Keep on looking just as you are! It's magnificent. Such color, and that queenly pose of the head! It would kill those Synthesis girls if they knew how he had been talking to you. My, if I could get anybody to be serious with me! Talk! Say something! Do you think its <b>going</b> <b>to</b> rain before we get home? His eyes keep turning this way, all the time; you can't see them, but they do. I am glad I brought my umbrella. Have you got your waterproof? I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> every word he said when he came to see you yesterday; it'll be mean if you don't. No, I think I shall go up by the elevated, and then take the surface-car across. It's the most romantic thing I ever heard of. No, I don't believe it will be dark. Speak! Say something! You mustn't let me do all the talking; he'll notice." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{do not ask}} you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{you what}} is in my heart; and I do not ask you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what is in yours. We are free Englishmen, who keep {{ourselves}} to ourselves, and think for ourselves, each man {{in the depths of}} his own heart; and who are the stronger and the wiser for not talking about our feelings to any man, priest or layman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pam," [...] he confessed, [...] "my brain won't stand it. You're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that Lutchester's in the game? Why, {{a simpler}} sort of fellow I never spoke to." ...|$|E
6000|$|ERNEST. Gilbert, you bewilder me. You {{have told}} me that all art is, in its essence, immoral. Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> now that all thought is, in its essence, dangerous? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Trying {{to get my}} goat again, eh?" [...] she retorted. [...] "I suppose that's what you're after. <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> I suppose, that it wasn't Craig I saw board this steamer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, no," [...] said Mr. Mawmsey; [...] "I was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him my opinion. Hear {{everything}} and judge for yourself is my motto. But he didn't {{know who he}} was talking to. I was not to be turned on his finger. People often pretend <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> things, when they might as well say, 'Mawmsey, you're a fool.' But I smile at it: I humor everybody's weak place. If physic had done harm to self and family, I should have found it out by this time." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Are {{you trying}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> or rather trying not <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> that Beatrice was mad {{enough to think}} of {{committing}} suicide?" [...] Elizabeth inquired.|$|R
