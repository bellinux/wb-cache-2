500|$|Willis {{described}} the production {{for the film}} as [...] "relatively easy." [...] He shot in varying styles; [...] "hot golden light for California, grey overcast for Manhattan and a forties Hollywood glossy for... dream sequences," [...] {{most of which were}} cut. It was his suggestion which led Allen to film the dual therapy scenes in one set divided by a wall instead of the usual split screen method. He tried long takes, with some shots, unabridged, lasting an entire scene, which, for Ebert, add to the dramatic power of the film: [...] "Few viewers probably notice how much of Annie Hall consists of people talking, simply talking. They walk and talk, sit and talk, go to shrinks, go to lunch, make love and talk, talk to the camera, or launch into inspired monologues like Annie's free-association as she describes her family to Alvy. This speech by Diane Keaton <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> perfect as such a speech can likely be... all done in one take of brilliant brinksmanship." [...] He cites a study that calculated the average shot length of Annie Hall to be 14.5 seconds, while other films made in 1977 had an average shot length of 4–7 seconds. Peter Cowie suggests that [...] "Allen breaks up his extended shots with more orthodox cutting back and forth in conversation pieces, so that the forward momentum of the film is sustained." [...] Bernd Herzogenrath notes the innovation {{in the use of the}} split screen during the dinner scene to powerfully exaggerate the contrast between the Jewish and the gentile family.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian and the Evening Times {{highlighted}} the Star Stories parody as the [...] "pick of the day". Martin Skeggs of The Guardian commented, [...] "There's everything you {{ever wanted to}} know about the world's number one film star, including how he was introduced to Scientology (John Travolta whacked him over the head with a shovel), the time he met Nicole Kidman and asked her if she would mind sitting down to make him look taller". He characterized the parody as, [...] "A toned down version of real life, then." [...] Barry McDonald of the Evening Times described the episode as [...] "equally cruel and sidesplittingly hilarious". He commented, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> must-watch television as you're likely to get and a testament to the quality of comedy writing on display." [...] In a later review of the program for the Evening Times when it was shown again on re-runs, McDonald wrote, [...] "I don't care if it's been shown several times before, {{this is one of the}} shows which you just have to see again." [...] Anila Baig of The Sun {{highlighted the}} show as [...] "Best Spoof", and wrote, [...] "pint-sized Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise [...] is subjected to some serious mocking. We follow his film career, his marriages to Nicole Kidman and Katie Holmes (portrayed as a robot) and how everything in his life has been shaped by his belief in Scientology. The show is as crude as ever". Stephen Milton of The Sun described the parody of Cruise's appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show as [...] "the best gag in the whole episode". Aidan Smith of Scotland on Sunday wrote favorably of the show, and noted, [...] "Fearlessly, in view of how paranoid Scientologists are, the latest target was Tom Cruise. I especially liked the scene where the tiny screen giant winched himself, Mission Impossible-style, on to Nicole Kidman while she slugged from a tinnie like a good Sheila." ...|$|E

The discrepancy makes the molad interval about 0.6 seconds too long. Put another way, if the molad is taken as the time of mean conjunction at some reference meridian, then this reference meridian is drifting slowly eastward. If this drift of the reference meridian is traced back to the mid-4th century, the traditional date of the introduction of the fixed calendar, then it is found to correspond to a longitude midway between the Nile {{and the end of the}} Euphrates. The modern molad moments match the mean solar times of the lunar conjunction moments near the meridian of Kandahar, Afghanistan, more than 30° east of Jerusalem.|$|E
2500|$|According to Wraight, {{it is not}} {{straightforward}} {{to determine}} what Cristofori's pianos sounded like, since the surviving instruments (see above) are either too decrepit to be played or have been extensively and irretrievably altered in later [...] "restorations". However, in recent decades, a number of modern builders have made Cristofori replicas, and their collective experience, and particularly the recordings made on these instruments, has created an emerging view concerning the Cristofori piano sound. The sound of the Cristofori replicas <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the harpsichord {{as it is to}} the modern piano; this is to be expected given that their case construction and stringing are much closer to the harpsichord than to the piano. The note onsets are not as sharply defined as in a harpsichord, and the response of the instrument to the player's varying touch is clearly noticeable.|$|E

2500|$|Reviewing Blink, The Baltimore Sun dubbed Gladwell [...] "the most {{original}} American [...] journalist {{since the}} young Tom Wolfe".

Whilst Arveladze refused to be drawn into questions on whether the broadcast breached the code of conduct for broadcasters, the Georgian National Communications Commission and the Young Lawyers' Association of Georgia said that Imedi had violated the code with its broadcast. The Imedi chief was also forced to defend against allegations that top officials in the Georgian government, including Saakashvili, were informed about the programme before it went to air. After a finding by the GNMC that the broadcast violated the broadcaster's code of conduct, the broadcaster was directed to make a public apology.|$|E
