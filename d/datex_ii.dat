50|$|DATEX (as <b>DATEX</b> <b>II)</b> is {{now being}} {{standardized}} through the European standards agency CEN and UTMC {{has been involved in}} a number of European standards-related projects, notably POSSE http://www.posse-openits.eu/en/. There is a current workstream within UTMC aiming to align the UTMC Technical Specification more closely with <b>DATEX</b> <b>II.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{situation}} is a software representation of an incident (for example security alert, cancellation or bad weather) or event that is affecting or is likely to affect the transport network. A journey planner can integrate situation information and use it both to revise its journey planning computations and to annotate its responses so as to inform users through both text and map representations. A journey planner will typically use a standard interface such as SIRI, TPEG or <b>DATEX</b> <b>II</b> to obtain situation information.|$|E
30|$|These {{outcomes}} lead us {{to understand}} why the old instrument Delta Track <b>II</b> (<b>Datex</b> Finland) has been accepted as the reference instrument when new metabolic monitors are compared against its performance, mainly during IC studies in critical care patients. It is clear that the canopy in the Delta Track II performs as an open circuit MC technique with the capability to reject high frequency variabilities. Deltra Track’s hardware can be modelled as a time average filter so that the VO 2 and VCO 2 variabilities from unstable patients produce minimum inter-individual variations in the REE estimation (Severine et al. 2013; Miodownik et al. 2000).|$|R
40|$|Master’s thesis {{deals with}} {{implementation}} of a European standard <b>DATEX</b> <b>II.</b> This standard specifies the data format for information transmission in road transport. The road traffic is flowing streams of current information. For the work was selected network of meteorological stations, which will publish the measured data, ie weather conditions of road transport. Measured data {{will be available to}} consumers in the format <b>DATEX</b> <b>II.</b> Implementation will be operational in its entirety meteorological station from design to the actual web service that will produce data information for consumers...|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a master thesis at Chalmers University of Technology. The purpose was to design and {{implement}} a traffic information system with focus on mobile platforms. The system interprets <b>DATEX</b> <b>II</b> data from the Swedish road administration (Trafikverket) and parses the data to a spatial aware database. Each system user can create a number of routes to travel and the parsed <b>DATEX</b> <b>II</b> data is pushed to the user’s smart phone. The mobile phone application described in this thesis has been implemented in Android. The suggested system can be used in several other purposes thanks to its push technology and geographical aware database. Apart from the system this master thesis also researches the accuracy of one of the accelerometers commonly found in smart phones today as well as gives suggestions for further work and suggestions for future applications...|$|E
40|$|The fast {{progress}} of web technologies and modern navigation devices {{is helping the}} driver to gain real time information about the current traffic situation. The information can be accessed while driving through modern GPS devices or by accessing the internet (via the cell telephone, PDA or personal computer) before he actually hits the road. The following paper describes the integration of web technologies such as Google Maps with the European standard <b>Datex</b> <b>II</b> used for exchanging traffic related information, to display a point event on the road. The paper will describe a series of road accidents on the highway section H 4 Razdrto – Vrtojba. ...|$|E
40|$|In today's time {{of modern}} technologies, large {{increase}} of traffic and tendency towards {{more and more}} rational consumption of time, spend for transport, we practically daily meet with new manners of communicating the current traffic conditions to the users of the traffic network. Most new manners are above all available to the users of road and railway infrastructure, especially to daily commuters to work whom these information benefit the most. One of the manners is through map applications which enable users to check the traffic conditions on their cell phone or computer before hitting the road. The following paper describes the use of Google Maps application and its possible modification in features related to traffic conditions or information about the moving of public means of transport. There is also a chapter dedicated to the <b>DATEX</b> <b>II</b> protocol, which is an indispensable tool for communicating between Google Maps and the traffic control centers...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new {{general-purpose}} methodology to conduct studies on Human Factors in Transportation Systems. A full-fledged setup {{and implementation of}} the methodology is provided for validation. This setup, which uses real data to perform the simulation, includes a traffic micro-simulator, a driving simulator, a traffic control centre and an Advanced Driver Assistance System, providing an experimentation laboratory, in which empirical research can be conducted. The communication between the simulation components is made interchangeably using both the European standard <b>Datex</b> <b>II</b> and the SUMO TraCI protocols. Several usage scenarios are implemented and indications on how to extend the methodology to accommodate different requirements are provided; as to prove its usability and feasibility. A simple Human Factors study was conducted using the implemented setup. This study uses naturalistc data and evaluates the network performance gain by using an Advanced Driver Assistance System that recommends new routes to drivers in congestion situations and provides a final validation of the methodology. In conclusion, the methodology has been proved usable to effectively conduct Human Factors research and also to develop Advanced Driver Assistance Systems applications in a controlled, yet realistic environment.

40|$|In {{the final}} project is {{discussed}} about different traffic-travel information services for motorways users {{before and during}} the trip. The traffic is increasing and in the future building of new roads and traffic infrastructure will not be possible, because of economic and space capacities. Because of this {{is becoming more and more}} important the development of modern systems for monitoring and leading traffic. In this field an advanced traffic information service has a key meaning. For this reason there is a Slovenian and foreign traffic information services overview. There are analyzed technologies like are GSM-SMS, WAP, UMTS, internet, GPS, DAB, TMC-RDS etc. RDS-TMC system is actually one of the best for delivering real-time information. The Traffic Message Channel (TMC) is a specific application of the FM Radio Data System (RDS) used for broadcasting real-time traffic and weather information. Data messages are received silently and decoded by a TMC-equipped car radio or navigation system, and delivered to the driver in a variety of ways. RDS-TMC system uses ALERT-C protocol for data exchange. There is also DATEX protocol, which was developed for information exchange between traffic management centres and constitutes the reference for applications that have been developed in the last 10 years. <b>DATEX</b> <b>II</b> is an upgrade of DATEX and now also pushes the door wide open for actors of the traffic and travel information sector. Before mentioned technologies represents data interfaces in the ITS physic architecture of a traffic information service...|$|E
