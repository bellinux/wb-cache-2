Every hoist and fly-wheel directly connected with mechanical power, and every part of a water-wheel or engine worked by mechanical power, and every wheel race, must be fenced, whatever its position, and every part of mill-gearing or dangerous machinery must either be fenced or be in such position that it is as safe as if fenced. No protected persons may clean any part of mill-gearing in motion, and children may further not clean any part of or below manufacturing machinery in motion by aid of mechanical power; young persons further may not clean any machinery if the inspector notifies it to the occupier as dangerous. Security as regards the use of <b>dangerous</b> <b>premises</b> is provided for by empowering courts of summary jurisdiction, on the application of an inspector, to prohibit their use until the danger has been removed. The district council, or, in London, the county council, or in case of their default the factory inspector, can require certain provisions for escape in case of fire in factories and workshops in which more than forty persons are employed; special powers to make by-laws for means of escape from fire in any factory or workshop are, in addition to any powers for prevention of fire that they possess, given to every district council, in London to the county council. The means of escape must be kept free from obstruction. Provisions are made for doors to open outwards in each room in which more than ten persons are employed,/and to prevent the locking, bolting or fastening of doors so that they cannot easily be opened from inside when any person is employed or at meals inside the workplace. Further, provisions for security may be provided in special regulations. Every boiler for generating steam in a factory or workshop or place where the act applies must have a proper safety valve, a steam gauge, and a water gauge, and every such boiler, valve and gauge must be maintained in proper condition. Examination by a competent person must take place at least once in every fourteen months. The occupier of any factory or workshop may be liable for penal compensation not exceeding £Ioo in case of injury or death due to neglect of any provision or special rule, the whole or any part of which may be applied {{for the benefit of the}} injured person or his family, as the secretary of state determines. When a death has occurred by accident in a factory or workshop, the coroner must advise the factory inspector for the district of the place and time of the inquest. The secretary of state may order a formal investigation of the circumstances of any accident as in the case of mines. Careful and detailed provisions are made for the reporting by occupiers to inspectors, and entry in the registers at factories and workshops of accidents which occur in a factory or workshop and (a) cause loss of life to a person employed there, or (b) [...] are due to machinery moved by mechanical power, molten metal, hot liquid, explosion, escape of gas or steam, electricity, so disabling any person employed in the factory or workshop as to cause him to be absent throughout at least one whole day from his ordinary work, (c) are due to any other special cause which the secretary of state may determine, (d) not falling under the previous heads and yet cause disablement for more than seven days' ordinary work to any person working in the factory or workshop. In the case of (a) or (b) notice has also to be sent to the certifying surgeon by the occupier. Cases of lead, phosphorus, arsenical and mercurial poisoning, or anthrax, contracted in any factory or workshop must similarly be reported and registered by the occupier, and the duty of reporting these cases is also laid on medical practitioners under whose observation they come. The list of classes of poisoning can be extended by the secretary of state's order.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—There is {{restriction}} on {{the usage of}} mobile phone in certain potentially <b>dangerous</b> <b>premises</b> such as petrol station and hospital. The usage of mobile phones at those premises might cause some disturbances and hazards. Therefore, safety precautions {{need to be taken}} into consideration when we are within the premises. Unfortunately, there are still many users who disobey the rules and use their mobile phone in those areas. Therefore, mobile phone detector is used to monitor the usage in the premises. Thus, software approach is implemented. The design of this location-based safety alert system will make the smartphone to intelligently detect the user’s location all the time after it is activated. It will alert and ask the user to switch to airplane mode once the system detects the user is in those premises. Thus, the safety alert system not only acts as a reminder to reduce the chance of the accidents occurring to the user itself, but also allocate a safer surrounding to the public.

40|$|Summary In 2016, the Ombudsman {{completed}} {{a review of}} amendments made to the Restricted Premises Act to help target gun crime and premises used by serious criminals. The amendments introduced offences that can be committed by owners and occupiers of declared premises and   powers to search for firearms on declared premises without a warrant. A court can make a declaration under the Act in relation to certain premises where prohibited activities take place. Police can search these premises under a warrant, and declared premises at any time without a warrant.   Police previously {{had the power to}} search for alcohol and drugs. After the amendments, they can also search for firearms, weapons and explosives.   Our report found that the amendments have not enhanced police’s ability to disrupt OMCGs or detect firearms.   Police did not obtain any restricted premises declarations, conduct searches without warrant or lay charges for any of the new offences during the review period. Our report also found that police did obtain warrants under the new provisions of the Act to search seven suspected OMCG clubhouses, however those searches could have been done under the old provisions.   Our report outlines concerns about {{the way in which the}} seven searches were executed. Our report recommends amendments to the legislation to provide police with specific powers to manage the risks associated with potentially <b>dangerous</b> <b>premise</b> searches and also proposes that police clarify their powers to seize certain item...|$|R
40|$|Hospital autopsies, {{vanishing}} worldwide, {{need to be}} {{requested by}} clinicians and consented to by next-of-kin. The aim of this prospective observational {{study was to examine}} how often and why clinicians do not request an autopsy, and for what reasons next-of-kin allow, or refuse it. Clinicians at the Erasmus University Medical Centre were asked to complete a questionnaire when an adult patient had died. Questionnaires on 1000 consecutive naturally deceased adults were collected. If possible, missing data in the questionnaires were retrieved from the electronic patient record. Data from 958 (96 %) questionnaires was available for analysis. In 167 / 958 (17 · 4 %) cases clinicians did not request an autopsy, and in 641 / 791 (81 · 0 %) cases next-of-kin did not give consent. The most important reason for both clinicians (51 · 5 %) and next-of-kin (51 · 0 %) to not request or consent to an autopsy was an assumed known cause of death. Their second reason was that the deceased had gone through a long illness (9 · 6 % and 29 · 5 %). The third reason for next-of-kin was mutilation of the deceased's body by the autopsy procedure (16 · 1 %). Autopsy rates were highest among patients aged 30 - 39 years, Europeans, suddenly and/or unexpectedly deceased patients, and tissue and/or organ donors. The intensive care and emergency units achieved the highest autopsy rates, and surgical wards the lowest. The main reason for not requesting or allowing an autopsy is the assumption that the cause of death is known. This is a <b>dangerous</b> <b>premise,</b> because it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Clinicians should be aware, and communicate with the next of kin, that autopsies not infrequently disclose unexpected findings, which might have changed patient management. Mutilation of the deceased's body seems a minor consideration of next-of-kin, though how it really affects autopsy rates, should be studied by offering minimally or non-invasive autopsy methods...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LLM (Environmental Law and Governance)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to analyse}} {{the extent to which}} the South African legal framework governing the trans-boundary transportation of dangerous goods, provides for the regulation of environmental aspects in terms of dangerous goods transportation. The dissertation examines the role of regional and sub-regional laws in this regard in an effort to ascertain whether there is sufficient legal certainty and harmonisation of laws for environmental regulation. No specific law currently exists in South Africa regarding the regulation of dangerous goods transportation, rather the regulation of dangerous goods is effected by a multiplicity of laws. This state of affairs illustrates the difficulty that exists and may be associated with the enforcement of the regulation of dangerous goods transportation. Despite this, the multiple laws vividly elucidate the fact that there is a considerable degree of environmental protection vis-a-vis <b>dangerous</b> goods transportation <b>premised</b> on the fact that all environmental impacts could never be avoided or eliminated, but can be reduced to an extent.

5000|$|The Smurfit-Stone {{paper mill}} (formerly {{part of the}} Power Corporation of Canada empire) ceased {{operations}} in 2009, and the plant is in process of being demolished. The 225ac of industrial wasteland was sold on in January 2010 to the Green Investment Group partners. Their {{goal is to create}} innovative, alternative energy projects that enhance the Bathurst region and Northern New Brunswick. The plan anticipates attracting companies that utilize technologies focusing on energy generation, alternative fuels and waste-to-energy conversion. The property was as of July 2015 in violation of the city's <b>dangerous</b> and unsightly <b>premises</b> bylaw, but the owner is located outside the country, and was unwilling to deal with the property despite being given final notice by the city. [...] There were almost $1 million in back taxes and environmental reclamation costs associated with the former mill site as of July 2015. The provincial Department of Environment and Local Government Minister, Brian Kenny, issued a ministerial order, which required the company to clean up the site within 120 days, but the deadline passed on 14 August, so the file was passed on to the Attorney-General in order to determine whether charges would be laid.|$|R
40|$|This {{report shows}} that an {{outbreak}} of Foot and Mouth Disease in Australia is expected to generate very large adverse economic impacts to both producers and other industries inside and beyond the outbreak area; with financial losses and eradication activities also having social impacts. AbstractAustralia is free of the highly contagious foot‐and‐mouth disease (FMD), which affects cloven hoofed animals including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, deer, buffalo and camelids. This disease has serious economic and social implications for countries producing and exporting livestock and livestock products. When countries have {{an outbreak of}} FMD their livestock export products become subject to trade bans designed {{to reduce the risk}} of transmission of the disease to livestock in other countries. For exporters, this results in product being diverted to domestic markets where it sells at much lower prices (due to the increase in supply). Since Australia exports around 60 per cent of livestock production, mostly to markets sensitive to FMD, an outbreak would seriously affect our livestock producers, related agricultural business and other industries. This report evaluates potential economic costs and identifies the social impacts of a hypothetical FMD outbreak in Australia. The findings will inform policy on future management strategies and help minimise the costs of an FMD outbreak. ABARES modelled disease control strategies for three scenarios:A small outbreak in North Queensland, where most cattle are raised on extensive rangelands. A small outbreak in Victoria’s Goulburn Valley, which has a high density of livestock and intensive dairy farms. A large multi‐state outbreak that, by the time of detection, has spread from Victoria to all eastern states (New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania). Disease control strategies examined included:for the small and large outbreaks ‐ stamping out, which involves destruction and disposal of animals in infected and dangerous contact premises‐ stamping out with extensive vaccination, which requires vaccination of all FMD-susceptible animals within a designated ring surrounding infected and dangerous contact premises; and removal of vaccinated animals once the disease is containedfor the large multi‐state outbreak (in addition to the above) ‐ stamping out with targeted vaccination, which includes the vaccination of all cattle and sheep on mixed cattle and sheep farms within a designated ring surrounding infected and <b>dangerous</b> contact <b>premises.</b> In outbreak areas outside the high‐risk ring, stamping out (without vaccination) is undertaken. An outbreak of FMD in Australia would have adverse economic impacts on producers and other industries within and beyond the outbreak area. Financial losses and eradication activities would also have social impacts. Findings suggest these economic and social impacts can be reduced by the choice of eradication strategy. For example, vaccination could play a beneficial role in some outbreak situations. Impacts could also be reduced by resuming market access quickly (where feasible), response preparedness and use of communication before and during an outbreak.  Authored by Benjamin Buetre, Santhi Wicks, Heleen Kruger, Niki Millist, Alasebu Yainshet, Graeme Garner, Alixaandrea Duncan, Ali Abdalla, Charlene Trestrail, Marco Hatt, Lyndal‐Joy Thompson and Michael Symes...|$|R
