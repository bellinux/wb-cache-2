60|$|A hush {{lay on the}} Laughing Valley now. Snow {{covered it}} like a white spread and pillows of downy flakes drifted before the {{dwelling}} where Claus sat feeding the blaze of the fire. The brook gurgled on beneath a <b>heavy</b> <b>sheet</b> of ice and all living plants and insects nestled close to Mother Earth to keep warm. The face of the moon was hid by dark clouds, and the wind, delighting in the wintry sport, pushed and whirled the snowflakes in so many directions {{that they could get}} no chance to fall to the ground.|$|E

He paused a moment, but it still seemed best to proceed, and as Inga {{advanced}} in the dark, holding his hands outstretched before him to feel his way, handcuffs fell upon his wrists and locked themselves with a sharp click, and an instant later he found he was chained to a stout iron post set firmly in the rock floor.|$|E
6000|$|No known agent, save ice, {{can have}} {{produced}} those rounded, and polished, and scored, and fluted rochers moutonnes [...] "sheep-backed rocks"--so {{common in the}} Lake district; so common, too, in Snowdon, especially between the two lakes of Llanberis; common in Kerry; to be seen anywhere, as far as I have ascertained, around the Scotch Highlands, where the turf is cleared away from an unweathered surface of the rock, in {{the direction in which}} a glacier would have pressed against it had one been there. Where these polishings and scorings are found in narrow glens, it is, no doubt, an open question whether some of them may not be the work of water. But nothing but the action of ice can have produced what I have seen in land-locked and quiet fords in Kerry--ice-flutings in polished rocks below high-water mark, so large that I could lie down in one of them. Nothing but the action of ice could produce what may be seen in any of our mountains- -whole sheets of rock ground down into rounded flats, irrespective of the lie of the beds, not in valleys, but on the brows and summits of mountains, often ending abruptly at the edge of some sudden cliff, where the true work of water, in the shape of rain and frost, is actually destroying the previous work of ice, and fulfilling the rule laid down (I think by Professor Geikie in his delightful book on Scotch scenery as influenced by its geology), that ice planes down into flats, while water saws out into crags and gullies; and that the rain and frost are even now restoring Scotch scenery to something of that ruggedness and picturesqueness which it must have lost when it lay, like Greenland, under the indiscriminating grinding of a <b>heavy</b> <b>sheet</b> of ice.|$|E

Skiddaw stands in the centre of the group, surrounded by its many satellites. Above Bassenthwaite are Ullock Pike, Long Side, Carl Side and the sometimes wooded Dodd. Eastward are Skiddaw Little Man, Lonscale Fell and the diminutive Latrigg, a pleasant short climb from Keswick.|$|E
50|$|Blankets are {{distinguished}} from bed sheets {{because of their}} thickness and purpose. Blankets are thicker; even the thinnest blanket is thicker than the <b>heaviest</b> <b>sheet.</b> Blankets are generally used for warmth and comfort, while sheets are for hygiene, comfort and aesthetics. Blankets were traditionally made of wool because of wool's warmth, breathability and natural fire-retardant properties, while sheets were made of cotton or linen or silk, which are less irritating to the skin. Nowadays, synthetic fibers are frequently used for both.|$|R

50|$|Many {{standard}} magnesium alloys {{are easily}} welded by gas or resistance-welding equipment, but cannot be cut with an oxygen torch. Magnesium alloys are not welded to other metals, because brittle inter-metallic compounds may form, {{or because the}} combination of metals may promote corrosion. Where two or more parts are welded together, their compositions must be the same. Soldering of magnesium alloys is feasible only for plugging surface defects in parts. The solders are even more corrosive than with aluminium, and the parts should never be required to withstand stress. Riveted joints in magnesium alloy structures usually employ aluminium or aluminium-magnesium alloy rivets. Magnesium rivets are not often used because they must be driven when hot. The rivet holes should be drilled, especially in <b>heavy</b> <b>sheet</b> and extruded sections, since punching tends to give a rough edge to the hole and to cause stress concentrations.|$|E
50|$|For {{the summer}} filling of a tower silo, the {{unloader}} is winched {{as high as}} possible {{to the top of the}} silo and put into a parking position. The silo is filled with a silo blower, which is literally a very large fan that blows a large volume of pressurized air up a 10-inch tube on the side of the silo. A small amount of water is introduced into the air stream during filling to help lubricate the filling tube. A small adjustable nozzle at the top, controlled by a handle at the base of the silo directs the silage to fall into the silo on the near, middle, or far side, to facilitate evenly layered loading. Once completely filled, the top of the exposed silage pile is covered with a large <b>heavy</b> <b>sheet</b> of silo plastic which seals out oxygen and permits the entire pile to begin to ferment in the autumn.|$|E
5000|$|The cab {{and tender}} were {{constructed}} of plywood with facings of sheet steel on each side. Forward of the cab, {{the body was}} <b>heavy</b> <b>sheet</b> steel and steel plate. The brass bell originally installed on Boilermaker Specials I and II was installed on the boiler. A new headlight was installed {{at the front of}} the boiler. It featured a small 12-volt bulb reflected by a large parabolic mirror. It was so bright it could only be used during parades. A locomotive air horn was installed on the top left side of the cab. When the horn was sounded, the Boilermaker Special III could be heard from miles away. To complete the locomotive theme, [...] "steam" [...] could be sprayed from the smokestack. The steam was actually carbon dioxide released by the driver from a fire extinguisher cylinder within the cab and plumbed to a nozzle just below the top of the smokestack.|$|E

6000|$|Before Barney or {{his companions}} could recover from their surprise, they had other and more urgent matters to think about. The dark clouds burst overhead, {{and the rain}} descended like a {{continued}} water-spout--not in drops but in <b>heavy</b> <b>sheets</b> and masses; {{the roof of the}} hut gave way in several places, driving them into a corner for shelter; the river began to rise rapidly, soon flooding the hut; and, when darkness overspread the land, they found themselves drenched to the skin and suspended in their hammocks over a running stream of water! ...|$|R

In vernacular architecture, roofing material is often vegetation, such as thatches, the most durable being sea grass with a life of perhaps 40 years. In many Asian countries bamboo is used both for the supporting structure and the outer layer where split bamboo stems are laid turned alternately and overlapped. In areas {{with an abundance of}} timber, wooden shingles and boards are used, while in some countries the bark of certain trees can be peeled off in thick, <b>heavy</b> <b>sheets</b> and used for roofing.|$|R
50|$|The Eddy {{brothers}} s√©ance {{trick was}} exposed by the magician Chung Ling Soo. The trick involved a curtain {{that was put}} across the room, with musical instruments placed on a table inside the curtain space. Two {{members of the audience}} would be selected and enter the curtain. Horatio would grasp the audience sitter's left arm and the other sitter would grasp his right arm. To the audience outside the curtain, various musical instruments would be seen floating in the air above the top of the curtain and tapping the trio on the head. A hand would also come through the curtain and write a message on a slate held by William who was sitting outside the curtain. The trick was performed by Horatio evading control and releasing his hand. He would do this by various methods such as using a fake hand made from a piece of <b>heavy</b> <b>sheet</b> lead which he would place in his left hand and grasp the audience sitter's arm. Horatio would quietly remove his real hand with the leaden hand remaining behind, giving the sense of touch that an actual hand was there. With his hands free Horatio would manipulate the instruments and perform the alleged supernatural phenomena.|$|E
5000|$|Steve Baer {{was born}} in Los Angeles. In his teens while a student at Midland School, he read Lewis Mumford and decided {{technology}} needn‚Äôt necessarily degrade or complicate people's lives. In the latter 1950s, Baer worked at various jobs and attended Amherst College and UCLA. In 1960, he joined the U.S. Army, being stationed in Germany for three years. He also was married in 1960. After discharge from the Army, he and his wife, Holly settled in Zurich, Switzerland, where {{he worked as a}} welder and attended Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule, studying mathematics. Here he became interested in the possibilities of building innovative structures using polyhedra (non-rectangular polyhedrons).Baer and his wife moved back to the United States, settling in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Baer initially worked as a welder of trailer frames for the Fruehauf Trailer Services company. However, he soon went into business by forming a small company called Zomeworks with Barry Hickman and Ed Heinz. The partners experimented with constructing buildings of unusual geometries that they came to call [...] "zomes", often using <b>heavy</b> <b>sheet</b> metal as the main exterior material. Some of the earliest experiments were carried out in cooperation with members of the intentional communities Drop City and Manara Nueva.|$|E
5000|$|Carbon {{printing}} {{is based}} on the fact that gelatin, when sensitized to light by a dichromate, is hardened and made insoluble in water when exposed to ultraviolet light. Because of the comparative insensitivity of the material, sunlight or another strong source of UV light is normally used to minimize the required exposure time. To make a full-color print, three negatives photographed through red, green and blue filters are printed on dichromate-sensitized sheets of pigmented gelatin (traditionally called [...] "carbon tissue" [...] regardless of the pigment incorporated) containing, respectively, cyan, magenta and yellow pigments. They are developed in warm water, which dissolves the unhardened gelatin, leaving a colored relief image that is thickest where it received the strongest exposure. The three images are then transferred, one at a time, onto a final support such as a <b>heavy</b> <b>sheet</b> of smooth gelatin-sized paper. Usually, the yellow image is transferred first, then the magenta image is applied on top of it, great care being taken to superimpose it in exact register, and then the cyan image is similarly applied. A fourth black pigment [...] "key" [...] layer is sometimes added, as in mechanical printing processes, to improve edge definition and mask any spurious color cast in the dark areas of the image, but it is not a traditional component.|$|E

50|$|At the professor's house Sir Rustom {{talks of}} the prank that was played on him very reluctantly. He admits to taking his work very seriously and only revisits the memory when Ghote reminds {{him that there}} have been other victims. Rustom Engineer tells Ghote that he had two trusted assistants (no longer with him) who had worked for him for many years. Rustom often showed friends and {{visitors}} the workshop and the machine he was working on. He shows Ghote the machine he showed to the press, complete with the pump that was used to fool him. The next day Ghote is telephoned by Raja Bender, who wants Ghote to accompany him to see the yogi Lal Das attempt to walk on water. Ghote is alarmed to learn that tickets are being sold for up to 500 rupees and strongly suspects that another prank is about to be played. Raja Bender has also invited Rustom Engineer, Jack Cooper and Ram Kundar to witness the attempt. Lal Das begins his attempt to walk on water and immediately fails. Ghote becomes concerned when the yogi does not emerge from the tank and is forced to dive into the tank to rescue him. The yogi survives and Ghote resolves to interview Lal Das to learn who convinced him that he could walk on water. Ghote deduces that a <b>heavy</b> <b>sheet</b> of glass placed {{below the surface of the}} water must have been used to fool the yogi. A brief search locates the glass sheet at the back of the temple.|$|E
5000|$|In 1903, George Gibbs {{used his}} {{influence}} to {{contract with the}} Pennsylvania Railroad's shops in Altoona to build an all-steel prototype for the new subway. This car, numbered 3342, was tested in February 1904 and deemed to be too heavy for practical use in the new subway. It required further design changes before it could become serviceable. But most importantly, the all-steel prototype proved that an all-steel car could be feasible, and validated Gibbs' claims that the previously held fears of excessive vibration, poor insulation, and loud noise were unfounded. IRT engineers began modifying the all-steel design to lighten the cars to a more suitable weight. One of the largest breakthroughs came when engineers learned they could achieve a similar structural strength as the heavier car by constructing a [...] "skeleton" [...] floor frame made of thick, intersecting steel sills and crossmembers. This was in contrast to using a single thick, <b>heavy</b> <b>sheet</b> of steel for a large center sill that supported the car. Following this and other weight reducing changes, the IRT {{was ready to go}} ahead with a production order of the new [...] "Gibbs" [...] cars, so named after George Gibbs. Larger builders remained steadfast in their refusal to build all-steel cars. However, {{as a result of the}} generally successful introduction of the steel prototype car, the growing American Car & Foundry was willing to accept an order for steel cars. Three hundred were to be constructed, incorporating the latest modifications made by Gibbs and IRT engineers to reduce the weight of the cars.|$|E

As a result it was found that foils can compete economically with batch plating but are limited by adhesive temperature stability. Also absorber foils are very versatile and direct collector fabrication from heavy foils appears very promising...|$|E

2500|$|The Model Bs {{received}} by Chennault and assembled in Burma {{at the end}} of 1941 were not well liked. There were no auxiliary fuel tanks that could be dropped before going into combat, and there were no bomb racks on the wings. [...] Chennault considered the liquid-cooled engine vulnerable in combat because a single bullet through the coolant tank would cause the engine to overheat in minutes. [...] The Tomahawks also had no radios, so the AVG improvised by installing a fragile radio transceiver, RCA-7-H, which had been built for a Piper Cub. [...] Because the plane lacked a supercharger, its effective ceiling was about 25,000 feet. The most critical problem was the lack of spare parts; the only source of spare parts was damaged aircraft. The planes were thought to be what no one else wanted, dangerous and difficult to fly. But the plane had advantages: its gas tanks were self-sealing and could take hits without catching fire. There were two <b>heavy</b> <b>sheets</b> of steel behind the pilot's head and back. The plane as a whole was ruggedly constructed.|$|R
60|$|The {{wind blew}} in puffs, grew wilder, and roared through the willows, {{carrying}} bright sparks upward. Thunder rolled {{down over the}} river, and lightning began to flash. Then the rain fell in <b>heavy</b> <b>sheets,</b> but not steadily. The flashes of lightning and the broad flares played so incessantly that Duane could not trust himself out on the open river. Certainly the storm rather increased the watchfulness of {{the men on the}} bluff. He knew how to wait, and he waited, grimly standing pain and cramp and chill. The storm wore away as desultorily as it had come, and the long night set in. There were times when Duane thought he was paralyzed, others when he grew sick, giddy, weak from the strained posture. The first paling of the stars quickened him with a kind of wild joy. He watched them grow paler, dimmer, disappear one by one. A shadow hovered down, rested upon the river, and gradually thickened. The bonfire on the bluff showed as through a foggy veil. The watchers were mere groping dark figures.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, a {{two-dimensional}} solid {{consisting of a}} linear elastic isotropic material, for which the deformation energy depends on the second gradient of the displacement, is considered. The strain energy is demonstrated to depend on 6 constitutive parameters: the 2 Lam¬¥e constants (Œª and Œº) and 4 more parameters (instead of 5 {{as it is in}} the 3 D-case). Analytical solutions for classical problems such as <b>heavy</b> <b>sheet,</b> bending and flexure are provided. The idea is very simple: The solutions of the corresponding problem of first gradient classical case are imposed, and the corresponding forces, double forces and wedge forces are found. On the basis of such solutions, a method is outlined, which is able to identify the six constitutive parameters. Ideal (or Gedanken) experiments are designed in order to write equations having as unknowns the six constants and as known terms the values of suitable experimental measurements...|$|E
40|$|A linear elastic second {{gradient}} orthotropic two-dimensional solid that is invariant under (Formula presented.) {{rotation and}} for mirror transformation is considered. Such anisotropy {{is the most}} general for pantographic structures that are composed of two identical orthogonal families of fibers. It {{is well known in}} the literature that the corresponding strain energy depends on nine constitutive parameters: three parameters related to the first gradient part of the strain energy and six parameters related to the second gradient part of the strain energy. In this paper, analytical solutions for simple problems, which are here referred to the <b>heavy</b> <b>sheet,</b> to the nonconventional bending, and to the trapezoidal cases, are developed and presented. On the basis of such analytical solutions, gedanken experiments were developed {{in such a way that}} the whole set of the nine constitutive parameters is completely characterized in terms of the materials that the fibers are made of (i. e., of the Young‚Äôs modulus of the fiber materials), of their cross sections (i. e., of the area and of the moment of inertia of the fiber cross sections), and of the distance between the nearest pivots. On the basis of these considerations, a remarkable form of the strain energy is derived in terms of the displacement fields that closely resembles the strain energy of simple Euler beams. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the presented results. Classic bone-shaped deformations are derived in standard bias numerical tests and the presence of a floppy mode is also made numerically evident in the present continuum model. Finally, we also show that the largeness of the boundary layer depends on the moment of inertia of the fibers...|$|E
40|$|For this {{combined}} drying process the fundamental characteristics were determined using a unique facility in which air convection drying of paper could be investigated over {{the full range}} from pure impingement to pure through drying. As well as light weight paper the program tested <b>heavier</b> <b>sheets,</b> of printing paper grammage, which are not currently dried industrially by either impingement air or through air drying. Analysis {{is complicated by the}} two component processes becoming nonadiabatic when carried out simultaneously. Relative to pure impingement drying, for the combined process the water removal rates in the impingement exhaust are sensitively reduced by through flow. Through flow exhaust water removal rate curves are strikingly different from pure through air drying by the addition of a new rate period, termed the secondary increasing rate period, when the paper temperature is driven up by the falling rate period of impingement water removal. Parameters of the models for the combined process were related to process conditions. Predictions from this model are consistent with the earlier limited pilot plant results. Relative to pure impingement drying, the removal of even {{a small fraction of the}} drying air as through flow exhaust results in substantial reduction in drying time for the process of combined impingement and through air drying of paper...|$|R
