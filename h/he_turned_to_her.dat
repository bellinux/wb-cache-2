60|$|All {{the time}} Lily sat miserably on the sofa. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> swiftly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> all solicitude and gentleness, {{to inquire}} the reason of her outburst.|$|E
60|$|Harry {{remained}} speechless, {{his eyes}} fixed upon the box: at last <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sister Regina: A mother {{figure to}} Xan. She helped lift Xan's spirits {{when he was}} feeling depressed. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> for advice about coping with being an orphan.|$|R
6000|$|She sinks {{again into}} the chair, and again he withdraws. And [...] once more she gives him that soft eager look, and once more [...] averts it as <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Jacob {{rose to his}} feet. The girl's look of {{disappointment}} was so ingenuous that <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> back <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Again Wyllard stood silent. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> with {{a strong}} {{restraint}} in his face.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy {{flushed with}} pleasure. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and half-halted, but she {{continued}} to walk on.|$|E
60|$|So she {{was given}} the chance to keep his desk straight. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> for everything.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> {{his back}} <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> then, and began {{clipping}} away as before. Beth sprang up and {{laid a hand}} upon his arm, arresting him. Again <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> stare at <b>her,</b> and in his eyes was a look almost of fear.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I'll {{see whether}} I can rescue him," [...] Norgate remarked. [...] "Good show, isn't it?" [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> companion.|$|R
60|$|A {{movement}} of the Duchess recalled him {{to a sense of}} his social duty. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> courteously <b>to</b> <b>her</b> with extended hand.|$|R
60|$|Susie was convulsed with {{laughter}} at his pompousness, and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{with the utmost}} gravity.|$|E
60|$|Toward {{the end of}} the dinner, {{when the}} Girl was {{beginning}} to recover herself, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|His keen eye {{detected}} a crumb on his coat-sleeve. This retrieved and consumed, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> seeking explanation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Woman," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "leave your grease till tomorrow. Breakfast must {{be thought}} of. Is there any mutton in the house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|BARNABAS [rising also {{and rushing}} past Mrs Lutestring to the door, where <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> bar <b>her</b> way] No you don't. Burge: you understand, don't you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rather! No one {{can touch}} you." [...] With this <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> more <b>to</b> <b>her</b> again. [...] "But you can get, with a move, greater advantages?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{walked toward}} the window and stood looking out {{for a moment or}} two before <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> again.|$|E
60|$|Again Wyllard stood silent awhile. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{with the}} signs of a strong {{restraint}} in his face.|$|E
60|$|Brand {{drew back}} {{to let them}} pass. Marie also lingered. In a moment they were alone. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He had again, at random, {{laid back}} his trinket; with which <b>he</b> quite <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> a little wearily at last--even a little impatiently. [...] "I don't insist." ...|$|R
50|$|Astor, a zoology major, has {{dreamed of}} being with Mila since childhood. One night, after drunken revelry on his birthday, he brings <b>her</b> home <b>to</b> care for <b>her.</b> One thing leads to another, and a brief awkward {{courtship}} begins. Having idolized her for so long, and being an incurable romantic, the courtship ends as abruptly as it begins. Still obsessed with Mila, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> close friend Cali, recently un-friended for reasons unknown for advice, tips, pointers, and direction. This leads him in unexpected directions.|$|R
6000|$|The flash came; but <b>he</b> did not <b>turn</b> or blink, {{keeping his}} eyes fixed as firmly as before. 'There,' <b>he</b> said, <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> 'that's the {{way to look at}} lightning.' ...|$|R
60|$|He ceased. Valerie {{had caught}} {{him by the}} arm. At once his fury fell from him. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Tom {{looked away}} from Maggie, {{knitting}} his brow more strongly for a little while. Then <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and said, slowly and emphatically,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Barbara did {{not notice}} him wince as with pain when <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> for she was not at that moment looking at him.|$|E
50|$|Chief Engineer B'Elanna Torres {{dismisses the}} Vulcan Ensign Vorik {{at the end}} of his shift in Engineering. Before Vorik leaves, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and {{declares}} kunat so'lik - the ritual Vulcan marriage proposal. Specifically, Vorik intends that B'Elanna will become his mate. He explains that he has an intended bride back at home, but since Voyager is not likely to reach home anytime soon, he has decided to pick a mate aboard the ship, and has found B'Elanna suitable. Flabbergasted, she declines. He grabs her, cradling her face, and she punches him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will stay, I am sure; {{you will}} stay and nurse her;" [...] cried <b>he,</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and {{speaking}} with a glow, and yet a gentleness, which seemed almost restoring the past. She coloured deeply, and he recollected himself and moved away. She expressed herself most willing, ready, happy to remain. [...] "It {{was what she}} had been thinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do. A bed on the floor in Louisa's room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville would but think so." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> see <b>her</b> coming, {{twisting}} {{her apron}} in nervous hands. Pan's father and Blinky kept {{on toward the}} barn. Lucy came hurriedly, unevenly, pale, with parted lips, and eyes that held him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{with that}} happy {{brightness}} {{that made the}} charm of his disposition, and broke into a peal of healthy and natural laughter.|$|E
6000|$|Even Leger {{appeared}} astonished, and Ingleby flushed hotly as <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "Hetty," [...] he said sternly, [...] "what do {{you mean}} by that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "Thought my bicycle was on fire," [...] he said. [...] "Outside. Funny fancy! All right, reely. Little dog outside.... Miriam ready?" ...|$|E
60|$|EVE. I had {{not thought}} of that. You are very subtle. But if I create another Eve <b>he</b> may <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and do without me. I will not create any Eves, only Adams.|$|R
60|$|This time <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> look at <b>her.</b> The old dagger {{was drawn}} in her.|$|R
60|$|She {{raised her}} head at this attack, though indeed <b>he</b> had not <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
