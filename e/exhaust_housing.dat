40|$|Abstract. MAN Diesel’s 6 S 50 MC-C disel is a {{two-stroke}} {{marine diesel}} engine. Preload of the exhaust valve component is applied in four bolts. The preload of bolts {{can improve the}} fatigue strength of the exhaust component. In addition, the bolt pretension ensure the sealing in the maximum firing pressure. Using of simulation method, the displacement and deformation of exhaust valve component are analyzed when the maximum firing pressure and preload are applied. By analysis of the deformation of the <b>exhaust</b> valve <b>housing</b> under different preload force, the deformation of <b>exhaust</b> valve <b>housing</b> increase with the increaseing of preload. The maximum total deformation is 0. 40 mm in the preload of 720 KN. The maximum deformation occurs in the region near the bolt {{in the side of}} exhaust gas outlet. The deformation in the direction of Y-axis of <b>exhaust</b> valve <b>housing</b> is along the Y-axis opposite direction when the preload is greater than 540 KN.

50|$|The {{fourth-generation}} engine uses {{a proprietary}} CT15B turbocharger. This generation {{was used in}} the 1997-2002 ST215 Caldina GT-T AWD Wagon. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>housing</b> is actually cast into the cylinder exhaust manifold, rather than the normal practice of a separate turbine housing after the cylinder exhaust manifold. Due to this, the CT15 is backwards compatible with the third-generation 3S-GTE cylinder head only, not either the first or second generation. Intake charge was cooled by an air-to-air top-mounted intercooler fed through a new side-feed intake manifold. This generation utilizes a coil-on-plug ignition system and 550cc injectors. Boost remains at 13-14psi, however overboost fuel cut is increased to 21psi. Compression is increased to 9:1 and produces 260PS (256 hp) and 324N·m (239 lb-ft).|$|E
50|$|An {{external}} wastegate is {{a separate}} self-contained mechanism typically used with turbochargers {{that do not have}} internal wastegates. An external wastegate requires a specially constructed turbo manifold with a dedicated runner going to the wastegate. The external wastegate may be part of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>housing</b> itself. External wastegates are commonly used for regulating boost levels more precisely than internal wastegates in high power applications, where high boost levels can be achieved. External wastegates can be much larger since there is no constraint of integrating the valve or spring into the turbocharger and turbine housing. It is possible to use an external wastegate with an internally gated turbocharger. This can be achieved through a specially designed bracket that easily bolts on and restricts the movement of the actuator arm, keeping it from opening. Another route involves welding the internal wastegate shut which permanently keeps it from opening, but failure of the weld can allow it to open again.|$|E

40|$|Intensive {{livestock}} production is of major {{importance to the}} economies of many countries but is also connected {{with a number of}} environmental effects, including airborne emissions. Currently emission standards are becoming increasingly stringent in European countries and the livestock industry is challenged to comply with them.

In this paper, international and national Netherlands' emission regulations and targets are summarised for ammonia, odour and particulate matter (PM). Secondly, specific regulations on end-of-pipe air treatment technology are discussed in more detail. Finally the role of air scrubbing techniques in relation to Best Available Technique (BAT) is discussed. Currently air treatment systems are not considered as BATs in European Union (EU) legislation because of economic (high running costs), ecologic (high energy consumption, chemical use, discharge water), and technical reasons (unstable performance of bioscrubbers). Although we think that this rebuff is appropriate for bioscrubbers, it might be advisable to reconsider the status of acid scrubbers with regard to BA...|$|R
40|$|In the Dutch Hercules project feces {{and urine}} from pigs are {{collected}} separately underneath the slatted {{floor in a}} pig house and treated in two processes.

Experiments were conducted using a pilot scale packed bed scrubber in an experimental pig house. The ammonia scrubbing efficiency and the evaporation rate were determined during one pig fattening round of 112 days.

40|$|Odour from {{agricultural}} activities, such as {{the spreading}} of manure and the housing of animals, is increasingly being considered a nuisance in densely populated countries like the Netherlands. The objective {{of this research was}} to study the odour removal from pig <b>house</b> <b>exhaust</b> air by a biotrickling filter that had been implemented for ammonia abatement. At a regular pig production farm, the performance of a running full-scale biotrickling filter was studied for 72 days. Ammonia and odour removal efficiency were on average 79 % and 49 % respectively. Ammonia removal appeared to be based on an unintended accumulation of ammonium and nitrite in the system, instead of on production and discharge of nitrate. The odour removal efficiency showed a large variation that, for a major part, about 80 %, could be attributed to actual changes in the performance of the biotrickling filter. These changes were probably caused by variations in the composition of the air that were not completely reflected by the olfactometrically measured odour concentration, as the many different components that make up the odour each have different removal characteristics. It seemed that the biotrickling filter was operated below its maximum absolute odour removal capacity [OUE/(m(3) filter) /s], which means that the absolute odour removal will probably rise at increasing load. It was, however, not possible to distinguish between the influence of either the odour load or the odour concentration on the odour removal, because of a positive correlation between the odour concentration and the air flow. To increase the odour removal efficiency (%), the design of the filter probably needs to be optimised for both well and poorly water-soluble odour components...|$|R
40|$|Ammonia (NH 3) {{emissions}} from broiler houses have been monitored almost exclusively while {{the house is}} populated with live birds. Many American growers utilize litter {{for more than one}} flock. Between flocks, various litter management practices are used to prepare this 2 ̆ 2 built-up 2 ̆ 2 litter for the next flock, including some degree of house ventilation to keep the indoor ammonia concentration low. Ammonia volatilized from the litter is emitted to the environment during the downtime. This ammonia emission should be accounted for in the determination of a facility 2 ̆ 7 s annual ammonia emission inventory. In the study reported here, ammonia emissions were monitored from two recently depopulated broiler houses in Pennsylvania using built-up litter managed for five consecutive flocks. Average house air temperature during the monitoring period was 10. 2 °C, well below the typical temperature during flock production. Emission was calculated whenever a <b>house</b> <b>exhaust</b> fan was running. The results revealed ammonia {{emissions from}} the houses ranging from 212 to 1107 g h- 1. The daily emission rate (ER) was highest on day 2, coinciding with the first harrowing of the litter, and then decreased over subsequent days. These average values during downtime were about one-quarter of the ER values for market-size birds observed during flock grow-out in the same houses over the previous year. The reduced ER during the cleanout period was anticipated, since the built-up litter was at a lower temperature than during grow-out and there was no further fresh manure addition contributing to potential ammonia volatilization. Observed variation between these two houses with identical management and construction showed that monitoring a single house may not accurately predict empty house emissions, with unidentified factors other than management being responsible for this variability...|$|R
