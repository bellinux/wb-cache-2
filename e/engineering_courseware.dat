40|$|Abstract: For the {{development}} of new technology in industries in the Twenty-First-Century, the engineers must have creative and innovative talents to survive the competitions. Thus we need to cultivate the technological creativity in the engineering students for research and particularly for design and development. An interdisciplinary research team in National Central University has developed a set of learning modules with a web-based learning environment for cultivating the technological creativity in engineering students. The purpose of the web-based courseware is to promote creativity, team works, and to encourage the students to learn and apply pro-actively their domain knowledge through their involvement in the creativity projects. This paper describes how the web-based integrated courseware is built. This paper will also highlight our future plan to broaden the facilities in the web-based learning environment. The web-based learning environment currently consists of three major components: the creative activity bulletin board, the <b>engineering</b> <b>courseware</b> crucial to design and implementation, and the search engine.

The {{efficient}} authoring {{of learning}} content {{is a central}} problem of courseware <b>engineering.</b> <b>Courseware</b> authors will appreciate the benefits of tools which automate various authoring tasks.

This system exploits an opportunity provided by the emerging technologies of the Semantic Web movement, most notably knowledge-representation standards and knowledge-processing techniques. The system represents {{a combination of these}} newer developments with earlier work in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI) and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). A key feature of the authoring environment is the semi-automatic generation of standard e-learning and other courseware elements (learning objects). Widely available standardised knowledge representations (ontologies) and ontology-structured content are used as source material. Standard courseware elements are produced by the application of graph transformations to these ontologies. The resulting products can be hosted by standards-compliant delivery environments. Adaptivity is an important characteristic of the system as a whole.

40|$|The Generic Tutoring Environment (GTE) {{described}} by Kris Van Marcke is an exceptional instance of strong automation in <b>courseware</b> <b>engineering.</b> Given the applied nature of instructional design, an appraisal of GTE implies {{at least an}} assessment of its theoretical knowledge base and its referent system. In this paper {{it is argued that}} GTE's theoretical knowledge base focuses on teaching as a good model for any kind of instruction. This orientation along with its elaboration reduces the generic nature of GTE. From a slightly different perspective, i. e. a deviating knowledge base and referent system, two instances of weak automation are described. They are far less powerful than GTE but perhaps also a little bit broader with respect to their knowledge base. To conclude, three basic issues are mentioned that require intensive research: the separation of content and method; the formal description of learning environments, and the existing gap between research on design and development. Given the current problems with automation it is argued that at this stage efforts to automate instructional design contribute more to theory than to practice. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{models of}} Instructional Design (ID) have proven ill fit to {{university}} courses delivered with online technologies (Harvey, 2002; Uden, 2003). “As a field, distance education {{has yet to}} find a framework or model that truly {{takes advantage of the}} unique capabilities of online technology ” (Harvey, 2001, p. 29).

In order to discuss the differences in the types of ID models we created a classification system grouping them as formal, informal, and custom. These categories represent different levels of ID experience and different approaches regarding the instructor, cost, and time. Formal ID represents traditional models (e. g., ADDIE, Dick & Carey). Informal ID reflects the instructor’s natural process of course design. Custom ID combines formal and informal strategies, allowing for more rapid and a more personalized design approach.

40|$|Courseware is {{any form}} of {{computer}} or Web based learning material or Computer Aided Learning System, using digital media. <b>Courseware</b> <b>Engineering</b> (CE) is a new discipline that adapts and applies methods of Software Engineering (SE) to develop courseware. The aim of SE is to bring engineering rigour {{to the task of}} software development. SE is a systematic approach to requirement's analysis, design, implementation, validation and verification, maintenance and the eventual retirement of software. Modern software artefacts are extremely complex. SE methodologies deal with this complexity via abstraction and modularization. Specific goals of SE are to produce software that is maintainable and reusable. CE aims to make Courseware Development Methods equally rigorous and reliable as Software Engineering Methods. When developing new courseware, the initial design and ultimate implementation are critical to success. Therefore, a structured, documented approach provides a ‘clear roadmap’ for New Courseware Development (NCD) and can lead to successful implementation and a competitive advantage being achieved. We review the lifecycle of courseware and the courseware development process from concept to consumer. We discuss the vital aspects of CE: templates, modularity, re-use, maintenance, project management, version control and evolution.

This describes a widespread craft {{that has been}} maturing within educational institutions for a long time. In {{a wide range of}} scenarios, people working in this area now find themselves adopting various roles and engaging in a variety of challenging activities ranging from technology-oriented development work to audience-oriented implementation work. Within these scenarios the categories of educational objects with which people work are more diverse than ever before and hence include objects like: - low-level software widgets and tools used for developing courseware resources; high-level on-line services provided as part of managing the delivery of courses; collaborative educational networks of facilitators, teachers, and learners operating as virtual universities, global campuses, and so on. This paper offers some categorisation of the various components that populate these scenarios. So, in an arbitrary rather than authoritative framework, the paper highlights some typical roles that people adopt and some kinds of educational objects with which they interact.

40|$|This {{research}} supports {{the choice of}} a Design and Development Research approach for the creation and validation of ID methods, thus providing a theoretically-grounded and pedagogically-inclusive method for designing reusable pedagogical scenarios. It also presents a framework for articulating a generic instructional design theory with a coherent instructional design method, and hence, it contributes to augmenting the instructional design knowledge base. This dissertation presents a research divided into four main phases of development and validation. The first phase grounds the research in a theory of instructional design that aligns it with other related design disciplines, and decomposes the design problem into layers of artifact functionalities. This theory corresponds to software-engineering-infused instructional design methods also known as <b>courseware</b> <b>engineering.</b> The second phase explores ways to integrate an educational modeling language within an instructional design method for enabling the representation of pedagogical scenarios of computational facture. To reflect and experiment on this issue, we have chosen to study the MISA instructional design method developed at the LICEF research center and the IMS LD specification. The third phase presents an initial developmental solution, which is tested in a case study. We studied the introduction, into the MISA method, of a new technique supporting the design of a MISA pedagogical scenario according to IMS LD constraints. The aim was to test an 'economic' solution that would not require further modifications to the MISA method. We therefore conducted a case study where a technique for the representation of a conformed to IMS LD pedagogical scenario was applied to the transposition of a MISA pedagogical scenario by an expert instructional designer. The fourth and final phase exends the development and validation of a solution by way of a two-round Delphi method. We requested the participation of four experts. This developmental step included a selection and introduction of minor modifications of a set of MISA documentation elements identified as crucial for the design of IMS LD compliant pedagogical scenario. The Delphi enabled agreement on an adapted version of the MISA method that fulfills the design purpose. The final outcome of the design process is a pedagogical scenario with all the information required to run an IMS LD-like pedagogical scenario organized in a semi-formal manner and capable of translation into a structured markup language for running in a compliant learning management system. In this sense, the pedagogical scenario results in a document that can be understood as an intermediate state between a blueprint and an executable UoL...|$|R
