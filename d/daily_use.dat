5|$|However, Gandhi had sound {{reasons for}} his decision. The salt tax was a deeply {{symbolic}} choice, since salt was used by nearly everyone in India, to replace the salt lost by sweating in India's tropical climate. An item of <b>daily</b> <b>use</b> could resonate more with all classes of citizens than an abstract demand for greater political rights. The salt tax represented 8.2% of the British Raj tax revenue, and hurt the poorest Indians the most significantly.|$|E
5|$|Mrs Smith's Cottage is a {{mid-19th century}} Grade II listed {{building}} made from early Victorian red bricks. The range, {{the heart of}} the house, was in <b>daily</b> <b>use</b> for cooking and heating until the mid-1990s. The only access to the bedrooms is by a ladder. Electricity was installed in the 1930s, and the only other visible modern innovations are the coldwater tap – installed to prevent the local council condemning the cottage in the late 1970s – and an inside toilet. The original outside privy and washhouse can still be viewed.|$|E

5|$|By 1857, {{both the}} Royal Mint {{and the public}} were {{dissatisfied}} {{by the state of}} the copper coinage. Much of it was worn or defaced by advertisements, and 14 percent of the pennies in commerce were Boulton's 1797 cartwheels. The fact that pennies of different specifications circulated side by side precluded the weighing of quantities of copper coin to ascertain the value. Both sorts of pennies were deemed too heavy for <b>daily</b> <b>use.</b> The copper coins were so heavy that Charles Dickens in Nicholas Nickleby had Mr Mantalini contemplate suicide by drowning himself in the Thames, his pockets filled with halfpennies.|$|E

Objects from the site include a variety of stone tools made mostly from quartzite. Type and shape of these tools indicate not only the use on rock but also the prevalence of wood and leather working. Artwork such as pendants and beads from ostrich eggshell fragments have been found at several places. Of the items of <b>daily</b> <b>use</b> charcoal and bone fragments have been excavated as well as undecorated pottery fragments, although the pottery might have originated from early farmers rather than the Stone Age culture that produced the rock art.|$|E

5|$|The Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing, {{commonly}} known as the Dartford Crossing and until 1991 the Dartford Tunnel, is a major road crossing of the River Thames in England, carrying the A282 road between Dartford in Kent to the south with Thurrock in Essex to the north. It consists of two bored tunnels and the cable-stayed Queen Elizabeth II Bridge. The only fixed road crossing of the Thames east of Greater London, it is the busiest estuarial crossing in the United Kingdom, with an average <b>daily</b> <b>use</b> of over 130,000 vehicles. It opened in stages: the west tunnel in 1963, the east tunnel in 1980 and the bridge in 1991. The crossing, although not officially designated a motorway, is considered part of the M25 motorway's route, using the tunnels northbound and bridge southbound. Described {{as one of the most}} important road crossings in Britain, it suffers from heavy traffic and congestion.|$|E
5|$|The Dialogus de Scaccario or Dialogue {{concerning}} the Exchequer, written in about 1178, details {{the workings of}} the Exchequer and gives an early account of how the Pipe rolls were created. The Dialogue was written by Richard FitzNeal, the son of Nigel of Ely, who was Treasurer for both Henry I and Henry II of England. According to the Dialogue, the Pipe rolls were the responsibility of the clerk of the Treasurer, who was called the Clerk of the Pipe and later the clerk of the pells. FitzNeal wrote his work to explain {{the inner workings of the}} Exchequer, and in it he lists a number of different types of rolls used by the Treasury. He also describes the creation of the Pipe rolls and how they are used. The Dialogue also states that the Pipe rolls, along with Domesday Book and other records, were kept in the treasury, because they were required for <b>daily</b> <b>use</b> by the Exchequer clerks.|$|E
