To date, several approaches have been proposed for selecting the combination of number of data points, <b>flip</b> <b>angles,</b> and TR values that would provide the best estimate (i. e. lowest variance) of a given T 1 [1 - 5]. These previous studies converge {{to the conclusion that}} an optimal approach is a two-point acquisition with constant TR, and two <b>flip</b> <b>angles</b> yielding signal equal to 1 /√ 2, (≈ 70. 7 %) of the signal at the Ernst angle [2].

Then a 90° <b>flip</b> <b>angle</b> will yield the maximum signal intensity (or signal-to-noise ratio) per number of averaged FIDs. For shorter intervals between excitation pulses compared to the longitudinal relaxation, partial longitudinal relaxation until the next excitation pulse leads to signal loss in the subsequent FID.

40|$|Purpose: MR-visible markers {{have already}} been used for various {{purposes}} such as image registration, motion detection, and device tracking. Inductively coupled RF (ICRF) coils, in particular, provide a high contrast and do not require connecting wires to the scanner, which makes their application highly flexible and safe. This work aims to thoroughly characterize the MR signals of such ICRF markers under various conditions with a special emphasis on fully automatic detection. Methods: The small markers consisted of a solenoid coil that was wound around a glass tube containing the MR signal source and tuned to the resonance frequency of a 1. 5 T MRI. Marker imaging was performed with a spoiled gradient echo sequence (FLASH) and a balanced steady-state free precession (SSFP) sequence (TrueFISP) in three standard projections. The signal intensities of the markers were recorded for both pulse sequences, three source materials (tap water, distilled water, and contrast agent solution), different <b>flip</b> <b>angles</b> and coil alignments with respect to theB 0 direction {{as well as for}} different marker positions in the entire imaging volume (field of view, FOV). Heating of the ICRF coils was measured during 10 -min RF expositions to three conventional pulse sequences. Clinical utility of the markers was assessed from their performance in computer-aided detection and in defining double oblique scan planes. Results: For almost the entire FOV (± 215 mm) and an estimated 82 % of all possible RF coil alignments with respect toB 0, the ICRF markers generated clearly visible MR signals and could be reliably localized over a large range of <b>flip</b> <b>angles,</b> in particular with the TrueFISP sequence (0. 3 °– 4. 0 °).
