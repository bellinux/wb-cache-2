In 1923 brush holders were {{included}} in the product line. Starting in 1924, there was manufacturing of <b>electrographite</b> and after 1928 the manufacture of metal contacts as well. In 1932 sinter metal production was started with sintering bearings. After the death of Ludwig Schunk in 1947, the estate of the founder, who had not had any children, passed to the [...] "Providential Fund" [...] of Schunk+Ebe oHG. In 1948 and 1949 a construction program was set up to expand the operation from 500 to 1200 employees. There followed in 1956 the incorporation of Schunk & Ebe S.A. in Brussels, the first foreign subsidiary. At present, Schunk is represented in Europe with 46 operating companies. In 1957 Schunk Electro Carbón S.A. de C.V. was incorporated in Mexico, becoming the first company on the American continent. In 1969 there followed the founding of the Brazilian company Schunk do Brasil Ltda. in São Paulo.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{additional}} insight into the release mechanism of the metals in electrothermal atomization atomic absorption spectrometry, a quantitative relation between the heat of vaporization {{and the size of}} the released particles is proposed on the basis of the Kelvin equation, The applicability of the equation for the investigation of silver and gold vaporization is demonstrated and the limits in which the model is valid are determined. According to the present considerations the activation energy could be equal to the heat of vaporization of the silver and gold droplets. An explanation of the observed dependence of activation energy on analyte mass is given. The proposed relation provides a possibility for definition and evaluation of an ''effective'' radius/size of the droplets on the basis of their heat of vaporization. A correlation between the mass of the injected sample and the ''effective'' radius of the droplets, obtained at higher temperature is found. The minimum and maximum ''effective'' radii of the droplets, following the proposed equation are calculated for Ag On pyrolytic graphite coated <b>electrographite</b> (PGC) and Au on PGC, uncoated <b>electrographite</b> (EG) and glassy carbon (GC) tubes.

40|$|The {{energetics}} of atomisation of Pb, Cu, Ag and Au in pyrolytic graphite coated, uncoated <b>electrographite</b> and glassy carbon tubes was studied following {{deposition of}} the analyte {{as a solution}} (primary site) and as an aerosol vapour (secondary site). Arrhenius activation energies (Ea) for Pb and Cu were independent of tube type and mode of analyte deposition. An apparent first-order rate of release occurs from all tube types and from both primary-and secondary-deposition sites, suggesting that both elements desorb from the surface as individual atoms. Values of Ea for desorption of Ag and Au were independent of furnace tube type but dependent on the deposition mode, with fractional orders of desorption obtained throughout. Data for these elements suggest the formation of micro-droplets or caps (primary site) and islands (secondary site) with desorption occurring from the droplet surface or at the metal-graphite interface.

40|$|The {{wear rate}} and the {{magnitude}} of friction of commercially available graphites in air {{have been shown to}} be dependent on the corrosion resistance of the graphite. In air the wear rate of graphite was observed to increase with increasing temperature up to 6000 C. A very rapid type of wear was found to occur when graphite rubbed against austenitic stainless steel over a certain temperature range. The occurrence of this rapid wear was shown to be dependent on the surface finish of the steel, the composition of the steel, the state of oxidation of the metal, the corrosion resistance of the graphite and on the speed of sliding. It is concluded that this rapid wear is a result of oxidation of the graphite at the rubbing surface which leads to a rapid deformation and work-hardening of the normally soft austenite. Both the wear rate and friction of <b>electrographites</b> have been shown to decrease with increasing temperature in the inert environments of argon, helium and vacuum, though an exception to this general trend was found in one case. The general downward trend with temperature is ascribed to the increased activity of incident reactive species, particularly oxygen, towards the rubbing graphite. The importance of metal oxides in determining the magnitude of graphite wear rate in inert environments was investigated and it was shown that pre-grown oxide films could, in certain Circumstances, reduce wear rate by several orders of magnitude. It was also noticed that when low wear was induced by the presence of a metal oxide no transfer of a graphite film to the metal journal took place. The efficacy of a run-in film in allowing low wear to obtain under normally adverse conditions was investigated and it was shown that the substrate against which the graphite was rubbing was important. Only against copper could a low wear rate be sustained in vacuum after prior running-in in air had taken place. The topography of several rubbed graphite surfaces was investigated using a scanning electron microscope but no firm conclusions could be drawn with regard to particular mechanisms of wear, though agglomerates of very fine particles of graphite were often observed and it appeared, therefore, that a gradual attrition of the ends of firmly bonded crystals had taken place to produce these. X-ray diffraction confirmed that wear debris was amorphous in circumstances of both low and high graphite wea...|$|R
40|$|Time-resolved {{measurements}} of the release of CO and oxidants during the thermal decomposition of samples in a graphite furnace have been made spectroscopically by monitoring the attenuation of CO(0, 0) and CO(1, 2) bands at 154. 3 and 163. 1 nm, respectively, emitted from a hollow-cathode discharge supplied with 102 ̆ 0133 atm CO. Low-temperature carbon reduction of analyte oxides, concurrent carbon reduction-vaporisation and thermal decomposition-vaporisation reactions could be delineated through isolation of the CO and oxidant source functions. A major source of free oxygen in the furnace arises from analyte oxide decomposition. The capacity of glassy carbon tubes to accommodate low-temperature release of excess oxidants is inferior to that of <b>electrographite</b> or pyrolytic graphite coated tubes. Chemisorption of O 2 on to the tube surface influences the low temperature reduction capacity of the graphite tube and {{may play a role}} in the thermal shifting of absorption pulses and the 2 ̆ 01 cfirst shot back 2 ̆ 01 d phenomenon.

40|$|Time-resolved, direct Spectroscopic {{measurements}} of the PCO in an unperturbed high-temperature graphite furnace are reported, based on the attenuation of the CO(0, 0) transition at 154. 3 nm excited in a hollow cathode discharge. A model is presented {{to account for the}} kinetic and 2 ̆ 01 cdiffusion 2 ̆ 01 d control regimes observed for oxidation of <b>electrographite,</b> pyrolytic graphite-coated and glassy carbon tubes. Heterogeneous equilibrium appears to be established only at T 2 ̆aa 2 2200 K in coated tubes. Above 1500 K, glassy carbon tubes are as reactive toward 02 as coated tubes. The major source of O 2 in the unloaded furnace tube is ingress of ambient atmosphere through the sample dosing hole, giving rise to a steady-state PCO of 1. 2 7 102 ̆ 2123 atm at 2600 K. Release of oxidants from decomposition of sample matrices and their slow disappearance by diffusion/reaction processes contribute to an elevated PO 2, in the tube at temperatures < 2000 K.

40|$|Combustion of brick-shaped {{carbonaceous}} materials (carbon deposits from coke oven, coke and <b>electrographite)</b> {{was carried}} out in thermobalance in static air. Analysis of kinetics of the process {{was carried out}} using both classical (Arrhenius law) and newer (three-parametric equation) methods. In classical approach two types of kinetic equations were used in calculations: differential and integral. The results obtained show that, independently on kinetic variables (alpha - conversion degree or m - mass of sample) used in differential equations, kinetics of combustion of brick-shaped carbonaceous materials is characterized by only one pair of Arrhenius coefficients: activation energy (E) and pre-exponential constant (A). At the same time the integral equation demonstrates distinction in relation to methods based on differential equations, generating higher activation energies and separate isokinetic effect (IE). Parallel IE shows that kinetic analysis has to encompass activation energy in connection to second coefficient, pre-exponential constant A, depending on assumptions made for kinetic equations. On the other hand three-parametric equation allows describing kinetic of combustion in alternative way using only one experimental value - initial temperature in form of point of initial oxidation (PIO) - and also offers new methods of interpretation of the process...|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} aimed at hot shaping of {{titanium}} carbide/graphite and vanadium carbide/graphite composite materials by heating them to above 2000 degrees celsius and pressing into an <b>electrographite</b> die. The sample {{was to be a}} preformed cylinder of powdered graphite mixed with powdered titanium or vanadium, lightly sintered. The preform would be heated in a hot press and the titanium or vanadium would react with some of the graphite to form titanium or vanadium carbide. The remaining (excess) graphite would form a composite with the carbide, and this could then be deformed plastically at temperatures well below the onset of plasticity in pure graphite. There were to be two major thrusts in the research: In the first, an electron beam furnace at Sandia Laboratory was to be used for rapid heating of the sample, which would then be transferred into the press. The second thrust was to be entirely at Alabama A and M University, and here they intended to use a heated, controlled atmosphere press to forge the graphite/carbide preforms at a steady temperature and measure their viscosity as a function of temperature.

40|$|Modern {{constructions of}} {{electric}} ferroalloy furnaces are still based on applying {{in the lower}} "liquid " areas the standard carbon materials. What can be illustrated by the experience from several years, {{in the part of}} tap hole, hearth walls and bottom, is that so-called carbon or semigraphite microporous materials are suc-cessfully being applied. These materials, compared to the standard carbon, give better resistance to the attack by liquid metal and other wear factors. Generally this group includes materials characterised by considerable share of pores of diameters below 1 μm (significantly exceeding 90 % of total porosity). The microporosity increases the resistance to the infiltration of the liquid metal. The effect of microporosity can be obtained by introducing silicon (or its compound) additive to materials based on electrically (or gas) calcined anthracites, <b>electrographite</b> and binder. Moreover, by introducing other ceramic additives, the microporous materials are more resistant to dissolution by the liquid metal. Observing the trends of "improving the materials " in the last years, it is clearly seen that the share of non-carbon additives is bigger and bigger, so we can reasonably speak of rather carbon-ceramic materials. In this paper, the survey of the most important quality criteria, which must be met by the carbon furnace linings, as well as the new testing methods will be presented. 1...|$|E
40|$|Coat-Mix(CM) -{{materials}} are {{ceramic materials}} consisting of filler and binder components, which are produced {{in a special}} mixing process. They have an interconnected, open porosity and an excellent thermal shock resistance. Further the thermal, mechanical and chemical properties of these materials {{can be achieved by}} variation the filler and binder composition. An important application for CM is the use as a permanent die material. In this present publication the effects of the mold composition and process parameters on production (green body strength, shrinkage, real density) and application properties (bending strength, air permeability, thermal conductivity, open porosity) have been investigated. These different CM compositions were used for casting experiments for measuring the cooling rate of the permanent die material and the casting properties (fluidity, die filling capability, hot tearing behaviour) of AlSi- and PbSb/Ca-alloys. <b>Electrographite</b> was used as a filler material. The same casting experiments were duplicated with a grey iron mold. The oxidation behaviour of the CM-material has been investigated by means of thermal gravimetry in a flowing dry air medium at a temperature range of 400 C to 600 C. Hereby the reaction rate of the oxidation was measured and calculated by following the temporal burn off. (orig.) Dissertation submitted by C. M.

40|$|International audienceBurning off is {{the main}} method of carbon deposit removal from coke oven chambers. Optimisation of this {{operation}} {{is of a great}} interest both {{from the point of view}} of current production loss reduction and of coke oven plant lifetime extension. In this study the deposits originating from different parts of chambers have been characterised by chemical analysis, optical microscopy, XRD, Raman spectroscopy and mercury porosimetry. This investigation has shown that deposits contain two carbonaceous phases: the char from pyrolysed carry over coal particles and the pyrolytic carbon from raw gas cracking. Furthermore, the monitoring method for carbon deposits growth in coke oven chamber is presented. The statistical analysis of the visual inspection data has been a useful tool in the evaluation of the rate of deposit growth in individual coke oven chambers. The combustion kinetics of carbon deposits were studied by thermogravimetry under non-isothermal conditions with natural air draft and under isothermal conditions at controlled air flow rate. It was found that the reactivity of carbon deposits is in-between metallurgical coke and <b>electrographite</b> reactivity. At the temperatures below 700 degrees C, under laboratory conditions, the combustion rate (on the basis of external surface) is controlled by surface reaction at higher temperature and activation energy is around is 170 kJ/mol. At temperature higher than 700 degrees C combustion is controlled by gas film diffusion. Modelling of combustion in thermobalance experiments and in industrial coke oven chamber was carried out on the basis of measurement of kinetics using commercial CFD software...|$|E

Microelementosis (imbalance in {{the body}} of certain microelements — ME) is {{considered}} {{as one of the most}} important clinical and pathogenetic components of degenerative and inflammatory joint diseases, and ME can play the role of co-factors involved in the processes of articular inflammation. The objective: to study the levels in the blood serum and to assess the clinical and pathogenetic significance of osteoassociated ME (cobalt — Co, copper — Cu, iron — Fe, litium — Li, manganese — Mn, lead — Pb, strontium — Sr, zinc — Zn) in a variety of arthritis — rheumatoid (RA), Chlamydia-induced urogenital reactive arthritis (ReA), psoriatic (PsA), gouty (GA) and osteoarthritis (OA). Material and methods. There were 262 patients under observation, among them 89 persons suffering from RA, 31 — ReA, 35 — PsA, 49  — GA and 58 — OA. The distribution of males and females in these groups were 1 : 2, 2 : 1, 1 : 1, 11 : 1, 1 : 3, respectively, the average age of the patients was 47, 34, 42, 48 and 58 years, and the duration of clinical manifestations of the disease — 10, 4, 11, 7 and 12 years. ME in the blood serum were studied using atomic absorption spectrometer with <b>electrographite</b> atomizer SolAAr-Mk 2 -MOZe. Results. Microelementosis in arthritis is manifested by increased blood concentrations of toxic Li, Pb and Sr, moreover, the feature of ReA is a normal ferremia level, PsA — hyperkupremia, and OA — hypozincemia. Microelement blood composition depends on the activity, clinical and laboratory signs of disease, the prevalence of articular process, aggravation of bone destructive changes in the joints (subchondral sclerosis, osteocystosis, bone erosions, epiphyseal osteoporosis, etc), the presence of systemic osteoporosis, spondylopathies (osteochondrosis, spondyloarthrosis) and extra-articular manifestations of arthritis (lesions of the skin, muscles, peripheral nervous system, lymph nodes, internal organs). Blood indexes of Co, Cu, Li, Mn, Pb, Sn and Zn in RA, PsA and GA may have a certain prognostic value. Conclusions. In all the studied joint diseases, there is the disturbance of microelemental blood composition, which is involved in the pathogenetic development of RA, ReA, PsA, GA, OA and determines their clinical course, and in the future it will be possible to apply more rational medical technology for the diagnosis and treatment of joint diseases, to develop medications to correct microelementosis, to improve the quality of predicting the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions...|$|E

ME in the hair was examined by atomic absorption spectrometer with <b>electrographite</b> atomizer «SolAAr-Mk 2 -MOZe». Results. All patients with arthritis are prone to have microelementosis in hair. All nosological forms of joint pathology are associated with a significant decrease of Mn level in hair, when the level of Pb and Fe accumulated. Only RA was characterized by the absence of changes in the hair level of Co, PsA — of Cu, PA — Li and Sr. If, in comparison with healthy persons, the PA proceeds with an increased concentration level of Zn in the hair, the OA is characterized by an increased level of ME, that has a certain differential diagnostic value. There is either direct relationship between the hair and blood serum indexes (Mn, Pb) or multi-directional (Fe) ones. Microelement blood composition depends on the activity level, clinical and laboratory signs of disease, the prevalence of articular process, aggravation of bone destructive changes in the joints (subchondral sclerosis, osteocystosis, osteouzur, epiphyseal osteoporosis, etc), the presence of systemic osteoporosis, spondylopathies (osteochondrosis, spondyloarthrosis) and extra-articular manifestations of arthritis (lesions of skin, muscle, peripheral neural system, lymph nodes, internal organs).
