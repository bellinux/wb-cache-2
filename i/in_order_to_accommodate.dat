Our simulation study focus {{on the study of}} the coverage probabilities of these different confidence intervals and on the significance levels of some hypothesis tests. We discovered that parametric and non-parametric resampling methods can be successfully used for hypothesis testing and generating precise confidence intervals for the parameters even on small and moderate sized samples...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – To {{research}} the gender literature <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> {{determine whether it}} is advisable for a financial advisor to adjust their planning and advising processes based on {{the gender of the}}ir client. Design/methodology/approach – To correlate the gender literature with the personal financial planning process <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> determine whether advisors should adjust their approach based on the gender of their client. Findings – The gender literature reveals significant differences concerning how men and women invest; consequently, it is felt that it is advisable for financial advisors to tailor their approach based on the gender of their client. Research limitations/implications – The financial planning process should be modified to incorporate the gender of the client. Practical implications – Financial advisors should tailor their approach to the gender of their clients <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> ideal with them more effectively. Originality/value – As female investors grow in importance, processes should be modified or adjusted <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodated</b> their preferences.

5|$|During the 19th century {{some changes}} to Conwy's town walls were made <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> a new railway line and roads. The {{engineer}} Thomas Telford built two new gateways {{into the walls}} in 1826 to accommodate the traffic from the new suspension bridge across the river Conwy. In 1848 Robert Stephenson constructed the Chester to Holyhead railway line, which ran through Conwy; unusually for the period, {{attempts were made to}} sensitively protect the appearance of the medieval fortifications and the entrance for the railway through the walls {{on the south side of}} the town was built in the form of a mock-Gothic archway, while an exit tunnel was dug under the western walls.|$|E

5|$|Another {{improvement}} {{from the}} 12th century onwards {{was the creation}} of shell keeps, involving replacing the wooden keep on the motte with a circular stone wall. Buildings could be built around the inside of the shell, producing a small inner courtyard. Restormel Castle {{is a classic example of}} this development with a perfectly circular wall and a square entrance tower while the later Launceston Castle, although more ovoid than circular, is another good example of the design and one of the most formidable castles of the period. Round castles were unusually popular throughout Cornwall and Devon. Although the circular design held military advantages, these only really mattered in the 13th century onwards; the origins of 12th-century circular design were the circular design of the mottes; indeed, some designs were less than circular <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> irregular mottes, such as that at Windsor Castle.|$|E
