50|$|In 1971, a {{thorough}} {{revision of the}} Air Force training system called {{for the creation of}} new training squadrons. Re-created on 16, 9 November Squadron became part of the “Perfectioning Center” at Brustem, together with 7 Squadron and 11 Squadron. Its mission was to convert the new Instructor Pilots on the CM170 Fouga Magister, Lockheed T-33 and SF260 SIAI-Marchetti aircraft. The latter being employed at Goetsenhoven, the Squadron operated a detachment at that airfield. Although having received a new designation, the name of the former unit assuming the squadron’s mission, “FFM” (Flight de Formation des Moniteurs) stuck until well into the next century.During the following years, the most noteworthy changes were the replacement of the CM170 and T-33 by the Dassault Alpha-Jet as from January 1980 and the transformation of the unit into the Training and Evaluation Center of the Instruction and Training Command on 28 June 1985. Although keeping the same insignia and still being in charge of the training of new instructors, the unit was now a Staff section, detached in the training units. It became more involved in the standardization of the training. On request of the <b>Instruction</b> <b>Command,</b> regular “STANEVAL” inspections were carried out. In 1993, the Air Force’s SF260M were supplemented by 9 SF260D, that were equipped more extensively for instrument flying. Subsequently, the squadron’s expert instructors developed a training course for the benefit of those requiring an introduction to civilian IFR flying. This mission also remains with the squadron until the present day.|$|E

5000|$|This {{process works}} by {{depositing}} a simple, two-instruction program in memory and executing it. The first <b>instruction</b> <b>commands</b> the disk controller to begin reading the disk {{from the current}} disk address into the current memory address. The second instruction is a JMP instruction that jumps to itself endlessly. When [...] "Clear" [...] is pressed, the disk controller's current disk address is set to sector 0 and its current memory address is set to memory location 0000. When the read is commanded, the program stored in disk sector 0 overlays the bootstrap program and, once the JMP instruction is overlaid, the disk program takes control of the machine.|$|R
50|$|Computers run sets of {{instructions}} called a process. In operating systems, {{the execution of}} the process can be postponed if other processes are also executing. In addition, the operating system can schedule when to perform the action that the process is commanding. For example, suppose a process commands that a computer card's voltage output be set high-low-high-low and so on at a rate of 1000 Hz. The operating system may choose to adjust the scheduling of each transition (high-low or low-high) based on an internal clock. The latency is the delay between the process <b>instruction</b> <b>commanding</b> the transition and the hardware actually transitioning the voltage from high to low or low to high.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Considering the {{established}} needs for operator {{training in the}} construction industry and vastly improved data communication using Internet 2, the feasibility of an effective Internet based training system for backhoe operators is increasing. This paper presents ongoing work on a prototype system designed with the idea that eventually any electronically controlled backhoe can be adapted and connected to the Internet. Experimental tests have shown that 3 -D, real time video in combination with force and sound feedback provide a data-rich control environment for the trainee. This paper also discusses how the availability of force and spatial position data can be used for running an online training program that provides the user with a series of structured tutorials and practice sessions. System features of a Virtual Coach might include the haptic feedback featured in the prototype system, depending on its demonstrated relevance to training efficacy, as well as digitized verbal information, including <b>instructions,</b> <b>commands</b> and real-time advice...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} was {{originally intended to}} be a section of Schagrin, Morton L.; Rapaport, William J.; & Dipert, Randall R. (1985), Logic: A Computer Approach (New York: McGraw-Hill). This document discusses the ternary (i. e., 3 -place) if-then-else sentential connective, which is based on the if-then-else instruction of computer programming languages. Before we begin, however, we should look closely at an important difference between the use of if-then (and of if-then-else) in programming languages and its use in sentential (i. e., propositional) logic. In most logic texts (e. g., Shagrin et al. 1985) that are about the logic of declarative sentences—i. e., sentences, expressing propositions, that can be either true or false—the antecedent and consequent of a conditional sentence are themselves declarative sentences. But in an “imperative ” programming language such as Basic or Pascal, an if-then statement is really a conditional <b>instruction</b> or <b>command</b> whose antecedent is a delcarative sentence but whose consequent is an <b>instruction</b> or <b>command,</b> i. e., an imperative sentence. Thus, whereas in sentential logic we are interested in conditional sentences such as: If Ann goes to the party, then Bob will go to the party in many programming languages, we would be interested in conditional instructions such as...|$|R
