5|$|Bee-eaters spend around 10% {{of their}} day on comfort activities. These include sunning themselves, <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> and water bathing. Sunning {{behaviour}} helps warm birds in the morning, reducing the need to use energy to raise their temperature. It also has a social aspect, as multiple birds adopt the same posture. Finally, it may help stimulate parasites in the feathers, making them easier to find and remove. Due to their hole-nesting lifestyle, bee-eaters accumulate a number of external parasites such as mites and flies. Together with sunning, bouts of <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> (or water bathing where available), as well as rigorous preening, keep the feathers and skin in good health. Bathing with water involves making shallow dives into a water body and then returning to a perch to preen.|$|E
5|$|Emus are diurnal {{birds and}} spend their day foraging, {{preening}} their plumage with their beak, <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> and resting. They are generally gregarious birds {{apart from the}} breeding season, and while some forage, others remain vigilant to their mutual benefit. They are able to swim when necessary, although they rarely do so unless the area is flooded or they need to cross a river.|$|E
5|$|Lice {{may reduce}} host life {{expectancy}} if the infestation is heavy, but most {{seem to have}} little effect on their host. The habit of <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> in domestic hens is probably {{an attempt by the}} birds to rid themselves of lice. Lice may transmit microbial diseases and helminth parasites, but most individuals spend their whole life cycle on a single host and are only able to transfer to a new host opportunistically. Ischnoceran lice may reduce the thermoregulation effect of the plumage; thus heavily infested birds lose more heat than others.|$|E
50|$|Because {{feathers}} {{are critical}} to a bird's survival — contributing as they do to insulation, waterproofing and aerodynamic flight — birds {{spend a great deal}} of time maintaining them. For example, one study found that gulls spend 15% of their daylight hours preening during the breeding season. Preening can be associated with and follow or precede other maintenance behaviours including <b>dusting,</b> <b>bathing,</b> sunning, oiling or anting. Although preening is primarily an individual behaviour, some species indulge in allopreening, with one individual preening another, especially in hard to reach locations. The action of allopreening and its solicitation play roles in establishing hierarchies and in forming bonds within social groups of birds.|$|R
5|$|<b>Dust</b> {{or water}} <b>bathing</b> is common and often occurs in groups. Anting is rare. Head {{scratching}} {{is done with}} the leg over the drooped wing.|$|R
50|$|These {{elephants}} {{have developed}} certain adaptations for desert life {{and tend to}} have relatively broader feet, longer legs and smaller bodies than other African bush elephants. They are herbivorous and their diet varies with the time of year. In the wet season they prefer buds and fresh green leaves but in the dry season they subsist on drought-tolerant plants such as the camelthorn (Acacia erioloba), myrrh bushes, the mopane or turpentine tree (Colophospermum mopane) and the leaves and seedpods of the ana tree (Faidherbia albida). Adult bull elephants can eat about 250 kg of fodder a day and drink about 160 L, but they can go without water {{for up to three}} days at a time. They use water, mud or <b>dust</b> for <b>bathing</b> or coating their skin.|$|R
5|$|The Iago sparrow is gregarious while {{foraging}} and breeding. Outside of {{the breeding}} season, Iago sparrows {{are always in}} flocks, which may be of considerable size. It flocks with other birds, even warblers such as the blackcap and the Cape Verde warbler. The Iago sparrow is not very shy toward humans, allowing them to approach, even while it is at its nest. Birds on the isolated and uninhabited island of Raso will even perch on human visitors with little fear. Because of the scarcity of water to drink in its habitat, it has a strong attraction to sources of water, and large flocks may congregate when humans provide water it can drink. It often is seen <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> in small groups, a behavior necessary to keep clean with a paucity of water.|$|E
25|$|Birds {{maintain}} their feather condition by bathing in water, <b>dust</b> <b>bathing,</b> and preening. It {{has been suggested}} that a peculiar behavior of birds, anting, in which ants are introduced into the plumage, helps to reduce parasites, but no supporting evidence has been found.|$|E
2500|$|Cape ground {{squirrels}} live {{mainly in}} arid or semiarid areas. They prefer {{to live in}} velds and grasslands with hard ground. They {{can also be found}} in scrub along pans, on floodplains and in agricultural areas. Ground squirrel are generally active during the day and do not hibernate. They are burrowing animals that dig and live in clusters of burrows averaging around [...] with 2-100 entrances. [...] Burrow serve to protect the squirrel from extreme temperatures at the surface as well as predators. Nevertheless, most of the day is spent feeding at the surface. For thermoregulation, ground squirrels shade their head and back with their bushy tails. <b>Dust</b> <b>bathing</b> is also done.|$|E
5000|$|The {{house sparrow}} {{is a very}} social bird. It is gregarious at all seasons when feeding, often forming flocks {{with other types of}} birds. It roosts communally, its nests are usually grouped {{together}} in clumps, and it engages in social activities such as <b>dust</b> or water <b>bathing</b> and [...] "social singing", in which birds call together in bushes. The house sparrow feeds mostly on the ground, but it flocks in trees and bushes. At feeding stations and nests, female house sparrows are dominant despite their smaller size, and in the reproductive period (usually spring or summer), being dominant, they can fight for males.|$|R
5000|$|Peripheral factors seem {{relatively}} unimportant {{in controlling}} <b>dust</b> <b>bathing.</b> Deprivation of <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> {{results in an}} increase in lipids on the feathers and a subsequent increase in <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> activity when this is allowed. [...] However, although it has been speculated that the function of <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> is probably removal of excess lipids on the feathers, lipid accumulation as a major cause of <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> has not been proven. A 1991 experiment by Van Liere, et al. of the Wageningen Agricultural University of the Netherlands could only increase the duration of <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> bouts marginally by spreading lipids, equivalent to 1-2 months' accumulation, on birds’ feathers. Moreover, removal of the oil gland in chicks, which eliminated the main source of lipids, had no effect on subsequent <b>dust</b> <b>bathing.</b> It therefore seems that the main effects of deprivation of <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> in hens act through a central mechanism and not a peripheral one.|$|E
50|$|Battery cages for {{domestic}} egg-laying hens usually have no <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> substrate. This {{is considered to}} be a welfare concern and as a consequence, <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> has been closely studied in domestic egg-laying hens. In the absence of substrate in cages, hens often perform sham <b>dust</b> <b>bathing,</b> a behavior during which the birds perform all the elements of normal <b>dust</b> <b>bathing,</b> but in the complete absence of any substrate.|$|E
50|$|Environmental {{temperature}} {{is an important}} external factor; the frequency of <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> is greater at 22 than at 10 °C. Addition of supplementary visible light also increases components of <b>dust</b> <b>bathing,</b> and when hens are individually housed, {{the presence of a}} group of hens <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> in an adjoining pen with a dust bath increased <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> compared with the amount occurring when the hens were absent from the pen., i.e. there is a strong influence of social facilitation.|$|E
50|$|Many species {{within the}} family Dipodidae {{participate}} in <b>dust</b> <b>bathing.</b> <b>Dust</b> <b>bathing</b> is often {{a way to use}} chemical communication. Their keen hearing suggests they may use sounds or vibrations to communicate.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dust</b> <b>bathing</b> {{has been}} {{suggested}} to have a communicatory function in several mammals such as the common degu (Octodon degus), the long-eared jerboa (Euchoreutes naso), and possibly in Belding's ground squirrel as they leave a [...] "pungent" [...] odor in the <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> areas. [...] It {{has been suggested}} that wallowing (a behavior similar to <b>dust</b> <b>bathing)</b> may serve functions such as thermoregulation, providing a sunscreen, ecto-parasite control and scent-marking.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dust</b> <b>bathing</b> (also called sand bathing) is {{an animal}} {{behavior}} characterized by rolling or moving around in dust or sand, with the likely purpose of removing parasites from fur, feathers or skin. <b>Dust</b> <b>bathing</b> is a maintenance behavior {{performed by a}} wide range of mammalian and avian species. For some animals, dust baths are necessary to maintain healthy feathers, skin, or fur, similar to bathing in water or wallowing in mud. In some mammals, <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> may be a way of transmitting chemical signals (or pheromones) to the ground which marks an individual's territory.|$|E

50|$|Birds {{without a}} uropygial gland (e.g., the emu, kiwi, ostrich and bustard) rely on <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> {{to keep their}} {{feathers}} healthy and dry.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dust</b> <b>bathing</b> {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied in the domestic hen. In normal <b>dust</b> <b>bathing,</b> the hen initially scratches and bill-rakes at the ground, then erects her feathers and squats. Once lying down, the behavior contains four main elements: vertical wing-shaking, head rubbing, bill-raking and scratching with one leg. The dust collects between the feathers and is then subsequently shaken off which may {{reduce the amount of}} feather lipids and so help the plumage maintain good insulating capacity and may help control of ectoparasites.|$|E
5000|$|Hens exhibit {{preferences}} for <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> substrate. When {{given a choice}} between wood shavings, lignocellulose (soft wood fibre, pelleted), Astroturf mat without substrate, or food particles, the time spent <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> and number of dust baths were higher in lignocellulose compared with wood shavings, food particles, and Astroturf. The average duration of a single dust bath was longer in food particles compared with lignocellulose and wood shavings. Most vertical wing shakes and scratching bouts within a single dust bath were observed in lignocellulose. Bill raking occurred more frequently in wood shavings and lignocellulose {{in comparison to the}} other substrates. No differences in the relative durations of behavioral patterns within a single dust bath were found. [...] In contrast, other research shows that straw or wood-shavings were no more attractive than feathers as a substrate for <b>dust</b> <b>bathing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{documented}} behaviors include <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> to rid {{themselves of}} parasites. They also form latrines and habitually defecate and urinate in designated locations where they reside.|$|E
50|$|This quail {{species is}} also an avid dust bather, {{individuals}} undergoing numerous bouts of <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> each day. When <b>dust</b> <b>bathing,</b> this bird will rake its bill and legs across the ground in order to loosen up the ground, and then use its wings to toss the dust into the air. As the dust falls {{back down to the}} ground around the bird, it will shake its body and ruffle its feathers to ensure they receive a thorough coating. This behavior is believed to function in such things as simple feather maintenance and parasite removal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dust</b> <b>bathing</b> is {{motivated}} by complex interactions between internal factors which build up over time, peripheral factors relating to the skin and feathers, and external factors, such as {{the sight of a}} dusty substrate.|$|E
50|$|The sparrows {{are some}} of the few {{passerine}} birds that engage in <b>dust</b> <b>bathing.</b> Sparrows will first scratch {{a hole in the ground}} with their feet, then lie in it and fling dirt or sand over their bodies with flicks of their wings. They will also bathe in water, or in dry or melting snow. Water bathing is similar to <b>dust</b> <b>bathing,</b> with the sparrow standing in shallow water and flicking water over its back with its wings, also ducking its head under the water. Both activities are social, with up to a hundred birds participating at once, and is followed by preening and sometimes group singing.|$|E

50|$|The {{tendency}} to dust bathe fluctuates according to time of day, with more <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> {{occurring in the}} middle of the day which suggests some type of endogenous circadian rhythm of motivation. If birds are denied the opportunity to dustbathe, the {{tendency to}} dustbathe increases with time, suggesting a Lorenzian build-up of motivation.|$|E
5000|$|Comfort {{behaviours}} {{are performed}} {{from an early}} age and change little during development. Several comfort behaviours are associated with the beginning of a rest period (e.g. grooming), whereas others are associated with the end of a rest period (e.g. stretching), possibly to prepare the body for escape or hunting. Others, (e.g. <b>dust</b> <b>bathing)</b> will be performed only when the appropriate internal and external stimuli are present (see also sham dustbathing). Animals generally perform comfort behaviours only when they are not engaged in essential activities (e.g. feeding, drinking, hunting, escape); these behaviours are therefore sometimes categorised as luxury activities. However, animals can be highly motivated to perform some comfort behaviours (e.g. <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> in hens), and conditions that thwart these behaviours (e.g. battery cages) are considered to have a negative influence on animal welfare. Furthermore, some comfort behaviours show a rebound increase in intensity or frequency after they have been prevented {{for a period of time}} (e.g. wing flapping after releasing caged hens).|$|E

5000|$|Wallowing {{in animals}} is a comfort {{behaviour}} during which an animal rolls its body about in mud, water or snow. [...] Some definitions include rolling about in dust, [...] however, in ethology {{this is usually}} referred to as <b>dust</b> <b>bathing.</b> Wallowing is often combined with other behaviours to fulfil its purpose, for example, elephants will often blow dirt over themselves after wallowing to create a thicker [...] "coating", or pigs will allow the mud to dry before rubbing themselves on a tree or rock to remove ectoparasites stuck in the mud.|$|E

50|$|Roborovski hamsters solely live {{in regions}} with loose sand. Therefore, you {{should at least}} offer your hamster a bowl of sand, for example play sand for kids or even better, {{chinchilla}} sand. Bird sand is not suitable, because it contains sharp elements like broken sea shells. <b>Dust</b> <b>bathing</b> will become {{a vital part of}} a hamster's daily hygiene and will keep a hamster's coat shiny, because it cleans out the surplus grease of its coat. The sand can be kept clean by sieving or washing out with water only and drying (no soap or other chemicals).|$|E
50|$|Celeus display {{displacement}} movements such as tapping, pecking and drumming, {{intention of}} movement displays (e.g. {{looking to the}} side before moving away) and territorial and sexual displays. Arboreal rest and use of nest holes for retreat is common. Water bathing and sunbathing has been observed but <b>dust</b> <b>bathing</b> is rare. Celeus fluff feathers when dozing or sleeping. Preening is daily with oil used from the oil gland for weather proofing feathers and protecting from skin and feather mites. Toes are groomed, and trees are used for bill cleaning. Passive and active anting has been noted in some species.|$|E
50|$|Opponents of Proposition 2 {{claim that}} California's current {{regulations}} ensure sanitary and healthy conditions for egg-laying hens {{in the care}} of law-abiding organizations. Proponents of Prop 2 say the best housing environments for farm animals must take into consideration freedom of movement and expression of normal behaviors. The American Veterinary Medical Association supports greater attention to the behavioral needs of farm animals, but has expressed concern that Proposition 2 is not sufficiently comprehensive to ensure that increases in behavioral freedom don't translate into increased risks of injury and disease (i.e., a typical welfare tradeoff). Furthermore, although Proposition 2 offers hens additional space, it doesn't address other behavioral needs such as nesting, foraging, and <b>dust</b> <b>bathing.</b>|$|E
