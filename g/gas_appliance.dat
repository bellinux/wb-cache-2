A British Association of Gas Managers was formed in 1863 in Manchester and this, after a turbulent history, became {{the foundation of the}} Institute of Gas Engineers (IGE). In 1903, the reconstructed Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) initiated courses for students of gas manufacture in the City and Guilds of London Institute. The IGE was granted the Royal Charter in 1929. Universities were slow to respond {{to the needs of the}} industry and it was not until 1908 that the first Professorship of Coal Gas and Fuel Industries was founded at the University of Leeds. In 1926, the Gas Light and Coke Company opened Watson House adjacent to Nine Elms Gas Works. At first, this was a scientific laboratory. Later it included a centre for training apprentices but its major contribution to the industry was its <b>gas</b> <b>appliance</b> testing facilities, which were made available to the whole industry, including <b>gas</b> <b>appliance</b> manufacturers. Using this facility, the industry established not only safety but also performance standards for both the manufacture of gas appliances and their servicing in customers' homes and commercial premises.|$|E

In 1985 a modern <b>gas</b> <b>appliance</b> manufacturing facility was built replacing the old car factory site.
