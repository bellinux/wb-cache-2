5000|$|Wind {{turbines}} come in {{a variety}} of sizes. Once in operation, a wind turbine experiences a wide range of conditions. This variability complicates the comparison of different types of turbines. To deal with this, nondimensionalization is applied to various qualities. Nondimensionalization allows one to make comparisons between different turbines, without having to consider the effect of things like size and wind conditions from the comparison. One of the qualities of nondimensionalization is that though geometrically similar turbines will produce the same non-dimensional results, other factors (difference in scale, wind properties) cause them to produce very <b>different</b> <b>dimensional</b> properties.|$|E

50|$|Organic {{conductors}} {{consist of}} {{donor and acceptor}} molecules building separated planar sheets or columns. The energy difference in the ionization energy acceptor and the electron affinity of the donor leads to a charge transfer and consequently to free carriers whose number is normally fixed. The carriers are delocalized throughout the crystal due to the overlap of the molecular orbitals being also reasonable for the high anisotropic conductivity. That is why it will be distinct between <b>different</b> <b>dimensional</b> organic conductors. They possess a huge variety of ground states, for instance, charge ordering, spin-Peierls, spin-density wave, antiferromagnetic state, superconductivity, charge-density wave to name only some of them.|$|E

5000|$|Besides {{the prime}} universe, there are {{apparently}} others, referred to variously as parallel universes, alternate realities, and <b>different</b> <b>dimensional</b> planes. The most prominent {{of these is}} the [...] "Radical Land" [...] where King Radical, Sparklelord and Ron Wizard are from. Elements of the Radical universe are implied to be on some greater form of existence, and that they cannot be replicated or comprehended in the prime universe. When brought from the Radicalverse into the prime, they become a [...] "pale imitation" [...] of their former existence, as they manifest as the closest approximation of themselves in the prime reality. King Radical has lamented that he cannot fully remember parts of his home, and that when he attempts to re-create or even describe them, they too are lessened by the prime universe. One other universe has been mentioned, an extremely dull universe which influences the prime universe as much as the Radicalverse does. King Radical has stated that he believes that the prime universe, with its time-dimension portal, {{is the result of a}} collision between the two. Travel between realities is possible through the pink time-dimension portal in the caves below Cumberland, though it is extremely unstable, making it ineffectual to use for travel.|$|E

5000|$|Using the super-advanced {{computer}} the Eternity Brain {{to control}} the flow of time for his next bid of conquest, though he realises this will stop time and thus destroy the universe as it cannot be halted, and he cannot revoke orders he has given, the Time Lord orders the Eternity Brain to pluck Jonah Hex, Miss Liberty, the Black Pirate, Enemy Ace and the Viking Prince from their respective eras and giving them power enhancements to battle the JLA and the JSA during their annual meeting, hoping they can stop the device by being lured to his castle. The two teams are beaten in the first battle by the empowered heroes, who are then transported to the Lord of Time's base, a castle in a <b>different</b> <b>dimensional</b> space around the year 3786.

50|$|The DC Universe is {{composed}} {{of a number of}} <b>different</b> <b>dimensional</b> planes, most notably parallel earths (see Multiverse), but the latter were eliminated when reality was altered by the Anti-Monitor (although stories featuring parallel earths have continued to crop up with various rationalizations in the following years). Other types of dimensions still exist, however, including the Antimatter Universe, the Pax dimension, the Fifth Dimension and The Bleed. Prison dimensions, such as the Phantom Zone are meant to house super powered criminals who are too powerful for any conventional means of containment. Dimensions make up many universes, of which some are created and destroyed with help from supernatural forces and elements from which power is drawn. As well, certain dimensions function as cross-over opportunities for heroes from different comic book companies to interact, either from competing companies, or from companies absorbed by competitors. The most notable example of the first kind of crossover has been between Marvel Comics and DC Comics, and the latter with Wildstorm Comics. An example of the latter kind of crossover would be DC's acquisition of Fawcett Comics, Quality Comics, and Charlton Comics and the absorption into the DC continuity of the original Captain Marvel, Plastic Man and Captain Atom. In this way, heroes originally published by different companies are now part of the same fictional universe, and interactions between such characters are no longer considered intercompany crossovers.|$|E
5000|$|Openness to {{experience}} is {{strongly related to}} the psychological construct of absorption defined as [...] "a disposition for having episodes of 'total' attention that fully engage one's representational (i.e. perceptual, enactive, imaginative, and ideational) resources.” The construct of absorption was developed in order to relate individual differences in hypnotisability to broader aspects of personality. The construct of absorption influenced Costa and McCrae's development {{of the concept of}} openness {{to experience}} in their original NEO model due to the independence of absorption from extraversion and neuroticism. A person's openness to becoming absorbed in experiences seems to require a more general openness to new and unusual experiences. Openness to experience, like absorption has modest positive correlations with individual differences in hypnotisability. Factor analysis has shown that the fantasy, aesthetics, and feelings facets of openness are closely related to absorption and predict hypnotisability, whereas the remaining three facets of ideas, actions, and values are largely unrelated to these constructs. This finding suggests that openness to experience may have two distinct yet related subdimensions: one related to aspects of attention and consciousness assessed by the facets of fantasy, aesthetics, and feelings; the other related to intellectual curiosity and social/political liberalism as assessed by the remaining three facets. However, all of these have a common theme of ‘openness’ in some sense. This two-dimensional view of openness to experience is particularly pertinent to hypnotisability. However, when considering external criteria other than hypnotisability, it is possible that a <b>different</b> <b>dimensional</b> structure may be apparent, e.g. intellectual curiosity may be unrelated to social/political liberalism in certain contexts.|$|E

40|$|Many <b>different</b> high <b>dimensional</b> {{data sets}} are {{characterized}} by the same underlying modes of variability. When these modes of variability are continuous and few in number, they {{can be viewed as}} parameterizing a low dimensional manifold. The manifold provides a compact shared representation of the data, suggesting correspondences between the high <b>dimensional</b> examples from <b>different</b> data sets. These correspondences, though naturally induced by the underlying manifold, are difficult to learn using traditional methods in supervised learning. In this paper, we generalize three methods in unsupervised learning—principal components analysis, factor analysis, and locally linear embedding— to discover subspaces and manifolds that provide common low <b>dimensional</b> representations of <b>different</b> high <b>dimensional</b> data sets. We use the shared representations discovered by these algorithms to put high <b>dimensional</b> examples from <b>different</b> data sets into correspondence. Finally, we show that a notion of “self-correspondence” between examples in the same data set can be used to improve the performance of these algorithms on small data sets.

40|$|Abstract — The {{data stream}} model has {{recently}} attracted attention for its applicability to numerous types of data, including telephone records, Web documents, and click streams.

One of the disadvantages of D-Stream algorithm is the large number of grids, especially for high-dimensional data.
