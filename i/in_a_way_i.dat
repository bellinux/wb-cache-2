25|$|I {{turned to}} Walter and said, “This movie is {{somewhat}} weirder than we thought.”... We just didn’t anticipate what {{the combination of}} elements was going to be. We had a very conscious design concept of the movie, but I think we didn’t fully grasp how strong it would be, {{in terms of the}} combination of elements. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> think Streets of Fire was about expanding The Warriors concept to a bigger stage. But when expanding it to a bigger scale, it changed. The movie’s bigness of size—compositionally—changed the meaning of things and made it more of a fairy tale... The Warriors, it was bewoven with a unique sense of realism. The fact that they made a deal with real gangs to be extras in the film. There was a true Godardian dialectic going on between artifice and reality. It’s a very real-world film, in some respects, but it’s very artificial at the same time... We did that again, but we put the emphasis on the artifice. And we didn’t fully…I want to say we had too much integrity. We went further with that, perhaps, than we should have. I don’t know. I can’t put everything together about what didn’t work, but the most damaging thing is that we didn’t have the right actor for Tom Cody. Maybe if we’d had Tom Cruise, we might have had a success. But our commitment to be stylized was thorough and conscious and maybe too extreme for the mainstream audience.|$|E
500|$|Pepper {{said that}} he regretted not having {{been invited to the}} Razzies and blamed the film's failure on [...] "a weak script and poor {{production}} values". Writer J. D. Shapiro received his Worst Screenplay award from Razzies founder John J. B. Wilson during a radio program; he commented that Travolta had called the script [...] "the Schindler's List of science fiction". Shapiro also made an appearance to pick up the Worst Picture of the Decade award at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards, giving a speech quoting negative reviews, and thanking both the studio for firing him and Corey Mandell for [...] "rewriting my script <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> never, ever, ever — could have imagined or conceived of myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Paolini said [...] "Brisingr" [...] {{was one of}} {{the first}} words he thought of for the book's title, as it was the first Ancient Language word that Eragon learned in the series, and it holds a {{particular}} significance for him. Unlike the first two books in the series, Brisingr has a subtitle: The Seven Promises of Eragon Shadeslayer and Saphira Bjartskular. Paolini revealed it in a newsletter at his official website, in which he said that it was added [...] "because I felt it suited the story, and also because, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> still view Brisingr and Book Four as two halves of the same volume; the subtitle is merely the name of the first of these two sections." ...|$|E

500|$|Discussing his onscreen {{relationship}} with Yang, McKidd said: [...] "It's {{not going to}} be easy for them. What I read when I read the season premiere, and this is just my take on it, is that it was very much two very analytical people, Owen and Cristina. They're very similar <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> think, as people. Two analytical people see each other over a crowded ER room and their eyes meet." [...] On the topic of Yang's triumphs and challenges in the eighth season, Oh said: [...] "It has been an extremely challenging year that has had a lot of ups and downs, both challenging and exhilarating. We would shoot all our scenes for a day or two straight, and that was extremely challenging because emotionally and physically it becomes really exhausting." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Rolling Stone ranked Are You Experienced fifteenth on {{its list}} of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. They placed four songs from the album on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: [...] "Purple Haze" [...] (17), [...] "Foxy Lady" [...] (153), [...] "Hey Joe" [...] (201), and [...] "The Wind Cries Mary" [...] (379). That same year, the record was one of 50 {{recordings}} chosen by the Library of Congress in recognition of its cultural significance {{to be added to}} the National Recording Registry. Writer and archivist Reuben Jackson of the Smithsonian Institution wrote: [...] "it's still a landmark recording because it is of the rock, R, blues... musical tradition. It altered the syntax of the music... <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> compare to James Joyce's Ulysses." ...|$|E
500|$|Both Toriyama and Kitase {{have responded}} to the mixed review scores the game received. Speaking to Siliconera about the Japanese reviews, Toriyama said that most of the negativity stemmed from the time limit, and that [...] "opinions on the game become more {{positive}} after some time since Lightning Returns initial release [...]" [...] Speaking with Joystiq, Kitase said that he [...] "wasn't really shocked. There are negative reviews and positive reviews, it's a real mixture. When I started making this game I took on very new challenges, so <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> had anticipated that there would be mixed opinions, so this is more or less what we had anticipated." [...] Shinji Hashimoto revealed in October 2016 that Lightning Returns met sales expectations and that Square Enix is satisfied with it.|$|E

500|$|Delsin's Native American {{heritage}} {{came from}} the game's setting in the Pacific Northwest, which features a large Native American population. Delsin wears a beanie inspired by one that Harper would wear around the studio (Harper recounted one particular staff meeting where {{four of the six}} team members were wearing hats). Delsin's character was inspired by United Kingdom street artist Banksy, as the development team appreciated Banksy's clandestine, satirical work. Developing Delsin's personality, the team posited the hypothetical: [...] "What if Johnny Knoxville had powers? What would he do with it?". Harper considered Delsin [...] "full of reckless abandon", the kind of character that would, upon gaining superpowers, jump off a cliff to see what happens. Fox considered Delsin [...] "flawed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> think a lot of us can relate to", trying {{to live up to his}} successful brother Reggie. He called the game's story a [...] "hero's journey".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Cobain {{was writing}} {{a number of new}} songs. At the time Cobain was {{listening}} to bands like The Melvins, R.E.M., The Smithereens, and the Pixies. Feeling disillusioned by the heavy detuned rock popular in the Seattle grunge scene upon which Sub Pop had built its image, Cobain—inspired by his contemporary listening habits—began writing songs that were more melodic. A key development was the single [...] "Sliver", released on Sub Pop in 1990 (before Grohl joined the band), which Cobain said [...] "was like a statement <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> had to write a pop song and release it on a single to prepare people for the next record. I wanted to write more songs like that." [...] Grohl said that the band at that point often made the analogy of likening their music to children's music, in that the band tried to make its songs as simple as possible.|$|E
500|$|According to Hendrix biographer Harry Shapiro, {{the music}} on Are You Experienced {{incorporates}} a variety of music genres from rhythm and blues to free jazz; author Peter Doggett noted its [...] "wide variety of styles", while journalist Chris Welch said [...] "each track has a different personality". Musicologist Gilbert Chase asserted that the album [...] "marked a high peak in hard rock", and music critic Jim DeRogatis characterized the LP and its preceding singles as [...] "raw, focused psychedelic rock". A contemporary review published in Newsweek in October 1967 identified the influence of soul music on the Experience and the album. In 1989, Hit Parader magazine ranked it number 35 in {{a list of the}} top 100 heavy metal albums. In 2006, writer and archivist Rueben Jackson of the Smithsonian Institution wrote: [...] "it's still a landmark recording because it is of the rock, R, blues... musical tradition.

500|$|Glicken's {{father said}} in 1991 {{that his son}} died {{pursuing}} his passion, {{and that he was}} [...] "totally absorbed" [...] with volcanology. United States Geological Survey co-worker Don Peterson adds that Glicken was keen in his enthusiastic approach to observation, and praises his accomplishments throughout his career and as a graduate student. Speaking about Glicken's personal passion for his field, his mentor and professor Richard V. Fisher writes, [...] "What happened at St. Helens is something that troubled [...] deeply for a very long time, and, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> think it made him even more dedicated than he was before." [...] Associate Robin Holcomb remarks that [...] "Harry was very enthusiastic, very bright, and very ambitious, ambitious to do something worthwhile on volcanoes." [...] Many studies have utilized Glicken's criteria for volcanic landslide recognition, and many subsequent papers on avalanches have acknowledged or referenced Glicken's 1996 report. Reflecting on Glicken's body of work, USGS employee Don Swanson names him as [...] "a world leader in studies of volcanic debris avalanches".|$|E
500|$|For the 30th {{anniversary of}} The Joshua Tree, U2 staged a 2017 concert tour in North America, Europe, and Latin America, {{on which the}} album was played in its {{entirety}} at each show. It {{was the first time}} the group toured in promotion of an album from their back catalogue, rather than a new release. As part of the tour, U2 headlined the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee in June. In rationalising the tour, the Edge cited the 2016 US presidential election and other world events for what he judged to be renewed resonance of The Joshua Trees subject matter. He said that in looking at the record's anniversary, [...] "things have kind of come full circle, if you want. That record was written in the mid-Eighties, during the Reagan–Thatcher era of British and U.S. politics. It was a period when there was a lot of unrest. Thatcher was in the throes of trying to put down the miners' strike; there was all kinds of shenanigans going on in Central America. It feels like we're right back there <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> don't think any of our work has ever come full circle to that extent. It just felt like, 'Wow, these songs have a new meaning and a new resonance today that they didn't have three years ago, four years ago.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Although in high school, Streep {{appeared}} in numerous school plays, she was uninterested in serious theater until {{acting in the}} play Miss Julie at Vassar College in 1969, in which she gained attention across the campus. Vassar drama professor Clinton J Atkinson noted, [...] "I don't think anyone ever taught Meryl acting. She really taught herself". Streep demonstrated an early ability to mimic accents and to quickly memorize her lines. She received her BA cum laude from the college in 1971, before applying for an MFA from the Yale School of Drama. At Yale, she supplemented her course fees by waitressing and typing, and {{appeared in}} over a dozen stage productions a year, {{to the point that}} she became overworked, developing ulcers. She contemplated quitting acting and switching to study law. Streep played a variety of roles on stage, from Helena in A Midsummer Night's Dream to an 80-year-old woman in a wheelchair in a comedy written by then-unknown playwrights Christopher Durang and Albert Innaurato. One of her teachers was Robert Lewis, one of the co-founders of the Actors Studio. Streep disapproved of some of the acting exercises she was asked to do, remarking that the professors [...] "delved into personal lives <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> find obnoxious". She received her MFA from Yale in 1975. Streep also enrolled as a visiting student at Dartmouth College in the fall of 1970, and received an Honorary Doctor of Arts degree from the college in 1981.|$|E

He complimented Madonna's jokes, chatting about her life in-between songs, for being [...] "raw and vulnerable" [...] and confessed that it was [...] "fascinating— and difficult— to watch. We're not used to Madonna on stage doing {{anything less than a}} fully rehearsed, slick stage show." [...] Concluding the review, Adams believed that Tears of a Clown professed Madonna's touring direction into the future. Writing for The Independent Nick Levine noticed that the singer [...] "tested out her stand-up comedy skills with a series of risqué jokes and took the opportunity to defend her controversial fashion sense." [...] Debbie Cuthbertson from The Sydney Morning Herald gave a positive review of the show, saying [...] "For the queen of self-control, it was an open, at times even vulnerable insight into her persona. She seemed relaxed, drinking Cosmopolitans as she spoke at length between songs."

[...] One journalist took note of the controversy when reviewing the album, stating: [...] "Back in 1994, the acclaim for Live Through This was undercut by whispers that Love's late husband wrote the album.
