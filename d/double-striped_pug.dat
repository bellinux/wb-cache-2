50|$|The <b>double-striped</b> <b>pug</b> (Gymnoscelis rufifasciata) is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. It is a {{widespread}} and common species, being found throughout the Palearctic region, including the Near East and North Africa.|$|E
50|$|Dianthus {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} Cabbage Moth, <b>Double-striped</b> <b>Pug,</b> Large Yellow Underwing and The Lychnis. Also three species of Coleophora case-bearers feed exclusively on Dianthus; C. dianthi, C. dianthivora and C. musculella (which feeds exclusively on D. superbus).|$|E
5000|$|The foliage is {{also used}} as a food plant by the larvae of Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) species such as the Geometridae common emerald (Hemithea aestivaria) and <b>double-striped</b> <b>pug</b> (Gymnoscelis rufifasciata), the Arctiidae giant leopard moth (Hypercompe scribonia), H. eridanus, H. icasia and H. indecisa, many species in the family Papilionidae (swallowtail butterflies), and the black-lyre leafroller moth ("Cnephasia" [...] jactatana), a tortrix moth.|$|E

50|$|Gorse is a {{valuable}} plant for wildlife, providing dense thorny cover ideal for protecting bird nests. In Britain, France and Ireland, it is particularly noted for supporting Dartford warblers (Sylvia undata) and European stonechats (Saxicola rubicola); the common name of the whinchat (Saxicola rubetra) attests to its close association with gorse. The flowers are sometimes eaten by the caterpillars of the <b>double-striped</b> <b>pug</b> moth (Gymnoscelis rufifasciata), while those of the case-bearer moth Coleophora albicosta feed exclusively on gorse. The dry wood of dead gorse stems provides food for the caterpillars of the concealer moth Batia lambdella.|$|E
50|$|They are {{extremely}} important food for numerous species of birds, and also are eaten by other wild animals. In the autumn and early winter the fruits are hard and apparently unpalatable. After being frozen or frosted several times, the fruits soften, and become milder in taste. During winter storms, birds often {{take refuge in}} hollies, which provide shelter, protection from predators (by the spiny leaves), and food. The flowers are sometimes eaten by the larva of the <b>double-striped</b> <b>pug</b> moth (Gymnoscelis rufifasciata). Other Lepidoptera whose larvae feed on holly include Bucculatrix ilecella, which feeds exclusively on hollies, and The Engrailed (Ectropis crepuscularia).|$|E
