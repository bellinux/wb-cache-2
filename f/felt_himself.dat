5|$|By 925, Romanos Lekapenos <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> {{strong enough}} to demand the payment of tribute from the Muslim cities {{on the western side}} of the Euphrates. When they refused, in 926, Kourkouas led the army across the border. Aided by his brother Theophilos and an Armenian {{contingent}} under the strategos of Lykandos, Mleh (Melias in Greek sources), Kourkouas targeted Melitene (modern Malatya), the center of an emirate which had long been a thorn in Byzantium's side. The Byzantine army successfully stormed the lower city, and although the citadel held out, Kourkouas concluded a treaty by which the emir accepted tributary status.|$|E
5|$|Although Elgar {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. He <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. He nevertheless married {{the daughter of a}} senior British army officer. She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his Enigma Variations (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, The Dream of Gerontius (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the Anglican establishment in Britain, but it became, and has remained, a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory.|$|E
5|$|The Ebden {{scholarship}} {{was usually}} worth £200 per year. However, in 1891, {{due to a}} failure of the fund's investments, it was worth only £100. The sale of Smuts's personal livestock holdings on the family farm had enabled him to pay his sea passage and left him with a small residue to bank, yet despite this there remained a substantial gap between his resources ad his essential needs as a student. During his first term Christ's College provided him with a small scholarship, but the gap remained. This was a crippling burden for Smuts, yet it was Professor Marais who was to come to his rescue. Smuts, having confided his difficulties to Marais towards the end of 1891 received by immediate return a cheque for £50. Marais urged Smuts to write to him whenever he <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> in need, in return of which Smuts took out a life insurance policy naming Marais as beneficiary. Should Smuts have died this policy would cover the loans, but while he lived, Smuts's integrity was Marais's only cover.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Mabel, {{and what}} are you going to do with yourself?' asked Joe, with foolish flippancy. He <b>felt</b> quite safe <b>himself.</b> Without {{listening}} for an answer, he turned aside, worked a grain of tobacco to the tip of his tongue, and spat it out. He did not care about anything, since he <b>felt</b> safe <b>himself.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Jim <b>felt</b> in <b>himself</b> {{a guilty}} stir, and {{under his breath}} he cursed the other's way of asking disagreeable questions; but aloud he answered-- ...|$|R

25|$|Dent {{received}} his primary education in Canadian schools, studied law in Brantford, Ontario, {{and became an}} attorney in 1865. He practised law for a few years, but found the profession did not suit him, and was drawn to pursue literary endeavours instead. He accordingly relinquished his practice {{as soon as he}} <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> {{in a position to do}} so, and went to England.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Royal Marine Reservist Lance Corporal Matthew Croucher {{received}} the George Cross {{for his actions}} whilst deployed with 40 Commando in Afghanistan. The incident occurred whilst on a reconnaissance patrol, when upon entering a compound he <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> activate a grenade tripwire. L/Cpl Croucher deliberately fell onto the device aiming to protect his colleagues from the blast. Fortunately he managed to cushion {{the majority of the}} blast with his Bergen whilst his body armour stopped further shrapnel, this left him with only minor injuries and his fellow Marines unharmed.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Fles {{carried on}} correspondences with other leading thinkers of his day, {{including}} an extended debate with Henri Polak regarding {{the nature of}} socialism and Fles' determined opposition to Zionism. Fles <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> to be Dutch, and saw Zionism as further separating Jews from their non-Jewish Dutch neighbors while reinforcing {{the image of the}} Jew as a foreigner. Instead, Fles favored assimilation into the cultures in which Jews found themselves. He endorsed mixed marriages to accelerate this process. Fles gathered many of his thoughts from this correspondence into the 1939 pamphlet Weg met het zionisme! (Down with Zionism!).|$|E
6000|$|... "Little beast!" [...] said Mr. Watson {{to himself}} as he opened it. It arrived by the morning post, and he never <b>felt</b> really <b>himself</b> till after breakfast.|$|R
60|$|Frank awoke feeling weak, but {{otherwise}} perfectly well. Mr. Goodenough administered a strong dose of quinine, {{and after he}} had had his breakfast he <b>felt</b> quite <b>himself</b> again.|$|R
60|$|In {{a quarter}} of an hour, Ralph <b>felt</b> quite <b>himself</b> again and, seeing one of his fellow staff {{officers}} gallop up, he asked him where he could find the general.|$|R
25|$|McClellan's {{replacement}} was Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside, {{the commander}} of the IX Corps. Burnside had established a reputation as an independent commander, with successful operations earlier that year in coastal North Carolina and, unlike McClellan, had no apparent political ambitions. However, he <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> unqualified for army-level command and objected when offered the position. He accepted only when it was made clear to him that McClellan would be replaced in any event and that an alternative choice for command was Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, whom Burnside disliked and distrusted. Burnside assumed command on November 7.|$|E
25|$|His work in Italy and for English clients formed {{enough of}} a {{reputation}} that in 1779 he was selected by the Prussian-born count Rieffenstein, who had been commissioned by Catherine II of Russia to send her two Italian architects to replace her French ones (Loukomsky 1928). Despite having just designed a manege in Monaco and a dining hall for the Archduchess of Modena, 35-year-old Quarenghi seems to have <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> underemployed, {{given the number of}} architects then working in Italy and the dearth of commissions from the church and nobility. He accepted Rieffenstein's offer without hesitation and left with his pregnant wife for St Petersburg.|$|E
25|$|In New York he was {{steeped in}} the artistic and social ferment of the WPA period. He {{exhibited}} in the Bonestell and ACA galleries, and his early circle of friends, with whom he exchanged paintings and drawings, included the painters David Burliuk, Pavel Tchelitchew, Walter Houmère, Rufino Tamayo and Mario Carreño and (later) Edward Laning. Far from setting out to become a ‘Dominican’ painter, he <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> {{to be part of}} a broader tradition. Here a key influence was his mentor, the Dominican art historian and musicologist Américo Lugo Romero. With Lugo he spent almost every day of the better part of a year in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, absorbing his mentor's working connoisseurship of Renaissance art as the two discussed and challenged attributions of paintings.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not until}} two days later that Andy Snow <b>felt</b> like <b>himself</b> again. No bones had been broken, but the acrobatic youth had {{received}} a shaking up that was severe.|$|R
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, Hutton was, but he <b>felt</b> annoyed with <b>himself.</b>|$|R
60|$|The Chemist stooped {{upon the}} ground beside the boy, and, {{with the same kind}} of {{compassion}} for him that he now <b>felt</b> for <b>himself,</b> covered him as he slept, and no longer shrank from him with abhorrence or indifference.|$|R
25|$|Rabbi Ziemba {{also took}} {{an active role}} in the Agudas Yisroel at an early stage. At its first Knessia Gedola (great gathering), he was not yet forty when chosen to serve as honorary {{secretary}} in the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. At the second Knessia Gedola, Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzenski agreed to serve as chairman of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah only if Rabbi Ziemba would continue in his position, while the forty-five-year-old Rabbi Ziemba <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> to be too young and sought to stay in the background. At the third Knessiah Gedolah in 1937 in Marienbad, Austria, which played witness to the last massive gathering of European Orthodoxy before the Holocaust, Rabbi Ziemba was at the height of his fame. He spoke twice to the full assemblage and each time was greeted with hushed silence and awe.|$|E
25|$|The war swung {{dramatically}} in Packer's favour on 28 November 1978 {{when the first}} day-night match on a traditional cricket ground was played at the SCG between the WSC Australian and West Indian teams. A near-capacity crowd of 44,377 turned out to watch the limited overs contest, serving a warning to the ACB. A few days later, the official Australian team was humbled in the first Test against England at Brisbane, a precursor to a 5–1 thrashing for a side now captained by the unprepared Graham Yallop. Even Yallop <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> unsuited to the position, and his team was unable to compete with an experienced, professional England side. Although the Englishmen merely defeated the opposition presented, they further damaged the ACB's cause by playing slow, grinding cricket. Consequently, attendances were poor and the media clamoured for the Australian team to return to full strength.|$|E
25|$|Animated by intense {{hatred of}} the Spanish faction, Paget lost no time after his arrival at Paris in putting himself in {{communication}} with Sir Henry Neville, the English ambassador, who forwarded {{a detailed account of}} the circumstances to Sir Robert Cecil in a despatch dated 27 June (O.S.) 1599. Cecil seems to have been by no means anxious to encourage Paget, but Neville was more favourable to him. Paget said he <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> slighted by the English government, but he nevertheless seems to have given from time to time important intelligence to Neville and to Ralph Winwood the succeeding ambassador at the French court. His attainder appears to have been reversed in the first parliament of James I, probably by the act restoring in blood his nephew William, Lord Paget, and it is presumed that he returned to England. His paternal estate, including the manor of Weston on Trent and other manors in Derbyshire, was restored to him on 13 July 1603; and on 18 August in the same year James I granted him £200 per annum, part of a fee-farm rent reserved by a patent of Queen Elizabeth, bestowing the lands of Lord Paget on William Paget and his heirs. He died, probably in England, about the beginning of February 1611-1612, leaving a good estate to the sons of one of his sisters.|$|E

500|$|For {{fairy tale}} {{researchers}} and folklorists Iona and Peter Opie, [...] "Thumbelina" [...] is an adventure {{story from the}} feminine point of view with its moral being people are happiest with their own kind. They point out that Thumbelina is a passive character, the victim of circumstances whereas her male counterpart Tom Thumb (one of the tale’s inspirations) is an active character, makes <b>himself</b> <b>felt,</b> and exerts <b>himself.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Jim <b>felt</b> in <b>himself</b> {{a guilty}} stir, and {{under his breath}} he cursed the other's way of asking disagreeable questions; but aloud he answered: [...] "Nothin', only you seemed scared of it at first. What are you goin' {{to do with your}} share, Matt?" ...|$|R
25|$|The {{next major}} {{race in the}} spring season was the Amstel Gold Race. This race, like the other Ardennes {{classics}} to follow, is much more hilly than the cobbled classics, and thus the three leaders from {{earlier in the season}} were not part of the team's squad. The team did send the runner-up from the 2010 race, Hesjedal, and he <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> to be on strong form entering the race. However, the Canadian was quite sick on race day, with stomach issues that caused him to be second from last in this year's edition, over 14 minutes down on the winner. The team's best finisher was Fischer in 28th. Hesjedal had largely recovered for La Flèche Wallonne and Liège–Bastogne–Liège, but he was not a factor in the conclusion to either race, coming 13th in Flèche Wallonne and 29th in Liège. He was the team's best finisher in Liège, but Le Mével did him better in Flèche Wallonne, riding to ninth place to secure 6 UCI rankings points. Martin took his first win of the season at the Giro della Toscana in June. Le Mével {{had been part of the}} last breakaway group to be caught before the finale, occupying first position on the road into the final kilometer of the race on the steep Stoppe d'Arca climb. Martin was part of a six-man group that caught and overhauled him, and he won the sprint to deliver for the team.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} on 8 December 65 BC in the Samnite south of Italy. His home town, Venusia, lay on a trade route in the border region between Apulia and Lucania (Basilicata). Various Italic dialects were spoken {{in the area and}} this perhaps enriched his feeling for language. He could have been {{familiar}} with Greek words even as a young boy and later he poked fun at the jargon of mixed Greek and Oscan spoken in neighbouring Canusium. Literary Latin must have sounded to him like a semi-foreign language, heard only at school. One of the works he probably studied in school was the Odyssia of Livius Andronicus, crammed into Italian boys with threats and floggings by teachers like the 'Orbilius' mentioned in one of his poems. School was made particularly irksome by a number of his fellow pupils, the overgrown sons of beefy centurions. The army veterans could have been settled there at the expense of local families uprooted by Rome as punishment for their part in the Social War (91–88 BC). Such state-sponsored migration must have added still more linguistic variety to the area. According to a local tradition reported by Horace, a colony of Romans or Latins had been installed in Venusia after the Samnites had been driven out early in the third century. In that case, young Horace could have <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> to be a Roman though there are also indications that he regarded himself as a Samnite or Sabellus by birth. Italians in modern and ancient times have always been devoted to their home towns, even after success in the wider world, and Horace was no different. Images of his childhood setting and references to it are found throughout his poems.|$|E
500|$|The elder Southard's {{life was}} often busy and sleepless. According to L. Vernon Briggs, a {{colleague}} at Boston Psychopathic Hospital, Southard considered himself hypomanic. [...] "He himself said {{that most people}} fell within one of the classifications of mental disease, and he <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> {{to be of the}} manic-depressive type. We seldom saw the depressive side of him though it was undoubtedly there; ordinarily he appeared carried away with enthusiasm about his latest interest– and everything worthwhile interested him", Briggs wrote.|$|E

60|$|This was the Colonel's first really false move, as he <b>himself</b> <b>felt</b> {{before the}} last word had left his lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I don't {{want to run}} such a risk again," [...] replied Earl, with {{rather a}} sickly smile. He was greatly shaken up, {{and it was a}} long while before he <b>felt</b> like <b>himself.</b> Randy could hardly keep from hugging his brother because of the escape.|$|R
500|$|Whale's {{companion}} David Lewis stated flatly that Whale's {{sexual orientation}} was [...] "not germane" [...] to his filmmaking. [...] "Jimmy was {{first and foremost}} an artist, and his films represent {{the work of an}} artist—not a gay artist, but an artist." [...] Whale's biographer Curtis rejects the notion that Whale would have identified with the Monster from a homosexual perspective, stating that if the highly class-conscious Whale <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> to be an antisocial figure, it would have been based not in his sexuality but in his origin in the lower classes.|$|E
500|$|The Canadian {{director}} Mike Hoolboom {{was diagnosed}} with HIV in 1988 or 1989, after going to donate blood. In a 1993 interview, he stated that he <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> working harder after the diagnosis, finishing films at a more rapid rate because he was uncertain how long he would live. Hoolboom also became [...] "fascinated with a body of parts spliced and spliced again", experimenting with [...] "interruptive rhythms" [...] {{as a way to}} reexamine simple acts. Having previously focused on films about the body, Hoolboom began dealing heavily with fragmentation, HIV/AIDS, and situations faced by those with the virus; Frank's Cock was his first venture directly addressing the AIDS issue.|$|E
500|$|However, {{there were}} {{problems}} between Thrale and Johnson, along with [...] "his defenders" [...] during his life and in criticism since then, over their [...] "gradual estrangement" [...] from each other {{after the death of}} her husband. These problems were then heightened by her marriage to Gabriel Piozzi. After Johnson's death, Thrale felt isolated because she believed that Johnson's previous friends along with the public as a whole did not accept her, and some {{went so far as to}} claim she abandoned Johnson in his final moments. In particular, James Boswell, who resented Thrale and <b>felt</b> <b>himself</b> as her literary competitor, began to exploit the falling out between Thrale and Johnson's friends in order to promote his Life of Samuel Johnson.|$|E
60|$|We both inquired {{after his}} health. We both asked him {{together}} whether he <b>felt</b> like <b>himself</b> again, after his terrible adventure {{of the past}} week.

60|$|The shaggy man {{got up and}} <b>felt</b> of <b>himself</b> {{to see if he}} was hurt; but he was not. One of {{the heads}} had struck his breast and the other his left shoulder; yet though they had knocked him down the heads were not hard enough to bruise him.|$|R
