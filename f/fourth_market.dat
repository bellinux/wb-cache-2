40|$|AbstractThis paper {{adopts a}} {{vulnerability}} perspective {{to look into}} some of the key developmental issues that have been raised in discussions following the global financial and economic crisis of 2008 – 2009. We contend that country vulnerability, defined as probability of shocks×(exposure−resilience), matters for future growth and poverty reduction. However, different ways of dealing with vulnerability all have specific advantages as well as downsides. First, coping with the aftermath of shocks can be painful and is inherently backward-looking. Second, prevention by reducing exposure is typically a long-term process. Third, increasing resilience through self-insurance often carries high opportunity costs. And <b>fourth,</b> <b>market</b> insurance and hedging may be politically sensitive and is largely unavailable to countries that need it most. Hence we argue for a multi-layered ‘therapy’, combining different approaches with attention to the short and long term, mindful of country specifics and with roles to play for both developing countries themselves and international actors. A tentative exploration of how vulnerability has been dealt with before and during the crisis suggests that, in some areas, important progress has been made.

30|$|Alternative {{approaches}} {{have been adopted}} to (partially) address the representativeness issue, building on the diversification of data sources. First, {{a number of studies}} decided to focus on the segment of the labour market where the coverage bias is likely to be less of a problem 10. Examples include focusing on graduates’ CVs and vacancies targeting this labour market segment or on sectors and professions that are by definition characterised by widespread access to the Internet (IT, librarians, webmasters, etc.). Second, diversification of data sources has been used in many studies. In addition to online job ads, other types of data sources can be analysed in parallel, such as practitioner literature or administrative data. A sample of vacancies based on administrative data can be created. Eurostat (2010) gives an overview of several such examples from European countries. For instance, Martikainen and Eurostat (2010) uses the Finnish Business Register to create a representative sample of job vacancies by weighting the observations in an appropriate way and using a suitable estimation technique that takes potential flaws into account. Data collection was done through computer-aided interviews and through the Internet. Around 10, 000 establishments out of 150, 000 were drawn by stratified sampling per year. Another example of an alternative approach takes the form of complementing content analysis of job advertisements with interviews with HR managers or recruiters. Third, some scope to correct possible biases might exist if online vacancies data can be linked to firm characteristics, which can then be controlled in quantitative analysis. <b>Fourth,</b> <b>market</b> coverage and technical advancement of the online job portal(s) in a given country need to be assessed in each country. In countries where a dominant portal exists, collected vacancies might be the best available source. These alternatives need to be weighed against the costs of collecting data by other means. Using job advertisements from an established portal and interpreting the results with caution to avoid potential biases can be a valid and acceptable choice.|$|E
