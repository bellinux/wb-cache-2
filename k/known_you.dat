5|$|From {{the very}} beginning, {{from the first}} moment I may almost say, of my {{acquaintance}} with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I had not <b>known</b> <b>you</b> a month before I felt {{that you were the}} last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Corea took a {{profound}} stylistic turn from avant garde playing to a crossover jazz fusion style that incorporated Latin jazz elements with Return to Forever. Named after their eponymous 1972 album, the band relied on both acoustic and electronic instrumentation and drew upon Latin American musical styles more than on rock music. On {{their first two}} records, Return to Forever featured Flora Purim's vocals, Corea's Fender Rhodes electric piano, Joe Farrell's flute and soprano saxophone, Airto Moreira on drums and percussion, with Stanley Clarke rounding up the group on acoustic bass. Drummer Lenny White and guitarist Bill Connors later joined Corea and Clarke to form the second version of the group, which expanded upon the earlier Latin jazz elements with a more hard-edged rock and funk-oriented sound inspired by Corea's admiration for Mahavishnu Orchestra, led by his Bitches Brew bandmate John McLaughlin. This incarnation of the group recorded the album Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy, before Connors' departure and replacement by Al Di Meola, who was present on the subsequent releases Where Have I <b>Known</b> <b>You</b> Before, No Mystery, and the best selling Romantic Warrior.|$|E

Tom never articulated his version of events in writing, but his brother Cedric wrote years later that {{it was an act of}} revenge for an attack made on local Aborigines by squatter Jesse Gregson.

500|$|It is {{doubtful}} {{whether it was}} possible for Speyer to resign from the Privy Council or as a baronet, there being no normal mechanism to do so, but the Prime Minister's response was supportive: [...] "I have <b>known</b> <b>you</b> long, and well enough to estimate at their true value these baseless and malignant imputations upon your loyalty to the British Crown. The King is not prepared to take any step such as you suggest in regard to the marks of distinction which you have received in recognition of public services and philanthropic munificence." [...] On 26 May 1915, Speyer and his family left for America.|$|E

500|$|King {{states the}} cover was odd; [...] "It {{took me a}} minute and a half to find a spot in the song where I knew where she was. It's so weird.

Like {{a minute and a}} half through I heard a line and was like, 'I know where she's at!" [...] In response, Slayer sent some T-shirts to Amos, which she said was appreciated. Hanneman echoed similar sentiments as King, but noted that a few years later when Slayer was playing a festival before Amos, Amos would allow Slayer to play a full set when the band was late.|$|E
500|$|In a 1980 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, John Lennon expressed his {{doubts about the}} notion of [...] "subconscious" [...] plagiarism, saying: [...] "He must have <b>known,</b> <b>you</b> know. He's smarter than that... He could have changed a couple of bars in that song and nobody could ever have touched him, but he {{just let it go}} and paid the price. Maybe he thought God would just sort of let him off." [...] Ringo Starr's reaction was more charitable: [...] "There's no doubt that the tune is similar but how many songs have been written with other melodies in mind? George's version is much heavier than The Chiffons – he might have done it with the original {{in the back of his}} mind, but he's just very unlucky that someone wanted to make it a test case in court." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Raining Blood" [...] {{was covered}} by Tori Amos on her 2001 album Strange Little Girls.

Like {{a minute and a half}} through I heard a line and was like, 'I know where she's at!'". The band, however, liked the cover enough to send Slayer T-shirts to her. The song was also covered by Malevolent Creation, Chimaira, Vader, Dokaka, Reggie and the Full Effect and Killick Erik Hinds, who covered the entire album on a H'arpeggione. [...] "Raining Blood" [...] was also covered by the New Zealand drum and bass band Concord Dawn on their 2003 album Uprising, and by Nashville, Tennessee band Asschapel on their 7" [...] "Satanation". A medley of [...] "Raining Blood" [...] and [...] "Postmortem" [...] appears on Body Count's 2016 album Bloodlust, preceded by a short monologue by lead singer Ice-T where he names Slayer as both a major influence on Body Count and as one of his favorite bands of all time [...] "and always will be"; a video for Body Count's version was released in August of 2017.|$|E

500|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{calls an}} {{emergency}} meeting asking everyone {{to come up}} with an idea to [...] "re-invigorate" [...] the office. Michael asks Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) for ideas, but Stanley is preoccupied with a crossword puzzle and says he's busy. Michael keeps asking him, and Stanley finally snaps at Michael, and says the titular [...] "Did I stutter?" [...] in a very loud, threatening tone. Michael, who is visibly shaken, ends the meeting. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) encourages Michael to take disciplinary action against Stanley, and Michael, initially resistant, decides to pretend to fire him to teach him a lesson. Michael first tells everyone in the office that he is not really firing him, and does so in front of all of them. Stanley responds by threatening to sue him and tell corporate of Michael's antics. When Michael tells Stanley that the firing was actually an attempt at teaching him a lesson, Stanley is angered and goes on a rant, yelling and insulting Michael. Michael suddenly barks at him to stop it, and tells everyone to leave the office, making everyone think he is about to berate Stanley. The camera crew sneak back in to film the exchange, where Michael tearfully (much to Stanley's annoyance) but calmly asks Stanley why he picks on him. Stanley states that he simply does not respect him, and when Michael suggests that Stanley does not know him very well he replies [...] "Michael, I've <b>known</b> <b>you</b> for a very long time. And the more I've gotten to know you, the less I've come to respect you." [...] Michael then takes an uncharacteristically professional tone with Stanley, and says that, while he accepts that Stanley does not respect him, he cannot take such a disrespectful tone with him, because he is his boss. Stanley responds by saying, [...] "Fair enough," [...] and the two shake hands.|$|E

2500|$|Minna {{pursued a}} career as an actress, specialising in female {{juvenile}} lead roles ("Erste Liebhaberin") in tragedies. She was in demand by many German theatre companies, and appeared in Dessau, Altenburg, Magdeburg and Dresden before she met Richard Wagner. In a letter dated December 27, 1833, Minna sets out her conditions for employment: she would not accept guest appearances, but expected the leading tragic and young heroine parts. Her fee was 600 thaler plus travelling expenses. While she was praised for her abilities as an actress, her physical charms also brought her admiration. One anonymous suitor wrote to her: [...] "When Nature created you, O Fair One, she broke the mold and never more may create so fair an image.

2500|$|On 6 June 2006, while {{addressing}} {{a conference in}} New York City, he criticised the United States administration for allowing [...] "too much unchecked UN-bashing and stereotyping". He stated {{that much of the}} political dialogue in the US about the UN had been abdicated to its most strident critics, such as conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh and the Fox News cable channel and, as a result of this, the true role and value of the UN has become [...] "a mystery in Middle America". These remarks resulted in a backlash from the White House and some US conservative commentators, culminating in a call for an apology by the US envoy to the United Nations John Bolton. Bolton added to reporters, [...] "I spoke to the secretary-general this morning, I said [...] "I've <b>known</b> <b>you</b> since 1989 and I'm telling you this is the worst mistake by a senior U.N. official that I have seen in that entire time." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{consistent}} {{performances in}} the 2012–13 domestic season, Dhawan was rewarded with a call-up to the Indian Test squad in February 2013 for the four-match series against Australia. He was the third-choice opener in the squad which consisted of Test regulars Virender Sehwag and Murali Vijay. India chose Sehwag and Vijay over Dhawan {{in the first two}} Tests, after which Sehwag was dropped from the squad owing to his poor form. No replacement was named in the squad for Sehwag, which made Dhawan the favorite to take his place in the third Test. Dhawan made his Test debut in the Test at Mohali on 14 March, receiving the cap from Sachin Tendulkar who said to him: [...] "We have <b>known</b> <b>you</b> as a very gutsy player in domestic cricket, now we hope to see you as a gutsy player in international cricket, so show us some guts." [...] The first day of the match was washed out by rain, and Australia elected to bat first after winning the toss on the second day. Australia were bowled out for 408 {{on the morning of the}} third day. In reply, India opened the innings with Dhawan and Vijay. The duo batted out the rest of the third day taking India to 283 for no loss at stumps on third day, with Dhawan batting on 185 and Vijay batting on 83. In the process, Dhawan scored the fastest century ever on Test debut, off 85 balls, breaking the long-held record of Gundappa Viswanath (137 vs Australia at Kanpur, 1969). Dhawan was dismissed for 187 (174 balls) in the second over of the fourth day, caught by Ed Cowan at silly point off the bowling of Nathan Lyon. He did not bat in India's second innings after suffering a hand injury while fielding during the fourth day. India went on to win the match by 6 wickets, and Dhawan won the man of the match award. He missed the fourth Test at Delhi after being ruled out for six weeks due to a fracture in his left hand.|$|E
