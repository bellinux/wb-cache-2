500|$|McIlrath {{wrote the}} video treatment, and remarked how the band at first {{had no idea}} {{what they wanted to do}} for the video due to the song's unique sound. McIlrath did know that since [...] "Swing Life Away" [...] has simple lyrics, he wanted the video to {{replicate}} the song's easygoing feel. The video was shot over a year after the release of Siren Song Of The Counter Culture, a rarity in the music industry, as most videos are shot only a few months after the song's parent album is released. Parts of the video were filmed at The Fireside Bowl, where Rise Against played some of their first concerts. Looking back on the video, McIlrath said: [...] "Parts of it are kind of cheesy...but it captured where I was at when that song was written - it was written when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> a house with four roommates in a bedroom and we were all just trying to figure out what to do with our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|Elias Kifle Maraim Beyene, a {{survivor}} from Ethiopia being {{asked about his}} memory of Michael Jackson after his death remembers: [...] "I won't ever forget Michael Jackson because his contribution to the song We are the World had a very significant effect on my life. I am 50 now but 25 years ago <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which {{at that time was}} suffering from a long drought and famine. It was a terrible situation. Lots of people became sick and many more died. Around one million people in all were killed by the famine. In 1984 Michael Jackson, along with a number of other leading musicians, made the song We are the World to raise money for Africa. We received a lot of aid from the world and I {{was one of those who}} directly benefitted from it. The wheat flour that was distributed to the famine victims was different to the usual cereal we bought at the market. We baked a special bread from it. The local people named the bread after the great artist and it became known as Michael Bread. It was soft and delicious.|$|E
500|$|After {{searching for}} {{prospective}} collaborators, Madonna chose {{to work with}} Babyface, whose previous work with artists like Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men, and Toni Braxton had resulted in successful smooth R songs. She was also fond of Babyface's song, [...] "When Can I See You" [...] from his third studio album For the Cool in You (1994). The singer's management called Babyface {{to set up a}} meeting and see if they wanted to work together. Once met, both were surprised by their camaraderie and wanted to write songs. Madonna came over to Babyface's house and after a couple of days they came up with two songs. One of them was based on a piece of music composed by Babyface, but he was not sure about its musical direction. He made Madonna listen to the composition, and she found a way to take the song forward. Babyface clarified that [...] "t was just a beat and the chords. From there we collaborated and built it up... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Beverly Hills and I created a little studio in my house, so she came over there to write." [...] Together they agreed that the first line of the song should be its title, and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was written. The words were never repeated in the track again.|$|E

500|$|By 2001, Arulpragasam {{designed}} the cover for Elastica's last single [...] "The Bitch Don't Work", {{and went on}} the road with the band to video document their tour. The tour's supporting act, electroclash artist Peaches, introduced Arulpragasam to the Roland MC-505 and encouraged her to make music, a medium in which Arulpragasam lacked confidence. While holidaying together in Bequia in the Caribbean, Arulpragasam began experimenting with Frischmann's MC-505. She adopted her stage name, [...] "M.I.A.", standing for [...] "Missing In Acton" [...] during this time. In her 2012 book Arulpragasam writes, [...] "M.I.A. came to be because of my missing cousin. I wanted to make a film about where he was since he was M.I.A. (Missing in Action) in Sri Lanka. We were the same age, went to the same schools growing up. I was also living in Acton at the time. So <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Acton looking for my cousin missing in action." [...] Of her time in Bequia, she told [...] "I started going out to this chicken shed with a sound system. You buy rum through a hatch and dance in the street. They convinced me to come to church where people sing so amazingly. But I couldn’t clap along to hallelujah. I was out of rhythm. Someone said, ‘What happened to Jesus? I saw you dancing last night and you were totally fine.’ They stopped the service and taught me to clap in time. It was embarrassing". Returning to West London, where she shared an apartment with Frischmann, she began working with a simple set-up (a second-hand 4-track tape machine, the MC-505, and a radio microphone), composing and recording a six-song demo tape that included [...] "Lady Killa", [...] "M.I.A.", and [...] "Galang".|$|E

2500|$|It is {{therefore}} {{no surprise that}} in 1941 the twenty-two-year-old Voris answered the call of a recruiting poster and enlisted in the Navy. He related the story in an April, 2004 interview: [...] "When the war clouds were rolling in, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> San Francisco. I walked past a big recruitment sign that said 'Fly Navy' with a pilot looking off into the wild blue yonder standing on the wing of the plane." [...] Voris passed a series of exams and was called to duty in Oakland a month later. Voris entered the Navy's flight training program, and was still in flight school when the Imperial Japanese Navy launched its attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{career began}} with blackface comedy at local clubs; {{this was the}} [...] "entertainment" [...] of which her mother had disapproved, however these {{performances}} landed Baker an opportunity to tour in Paris, which would become the place she called home until her final days. In the United States, Baker was often faced with rejection due to her race: [...] "One day I realized <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> a country where I was afraid to be black. It was only a country for white people. Not black. So I left. I had been suffocating in the United States.... A lot of us left, not {{because we wanted to}} leave, but because we couldn't stand it anymore.... I felt liberated in Paris." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a teenager, DeLillo was not {{interested}} in writing until a summer job as a parking attendant, where hours spent waiting and watching over vehicles led to a reading habit. In a 2010 interview with The Australian, DeLillo reflected on this period by saying [...] "I had a personal golden age of reading, in my 20s and my early 30s, and then my writing began to take up so much time". Among the writers DeLillo read and was inspired by in this period were James Joyce, William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, and Ernest Hemingway, who was a major influence on DeLillo's earliest attempts at writing in his late teens. As well as the influence of modernist fiction, DeLillo has also cited the influence of jazz music – [...] "guys like Ornette Coleman and Mingus and Coltrane and Miles Davis" [...] – and postwar cinema: [...] "Antonioni and Godard and Truffaut, and then in the '70s came the Americans, many of whom were influenced by the Europeans: Kubrick, Altman, Coppola, Scorsese and so on. I don't know how they may have affected the way I write, but I do have a visual sense." [...] On the influence of film, particularly European cinema, on his work, DeLillo has said, [...] "European and Asian cinemas of the 1960s shaped the way I think and feel about things. At that time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> New York, I didn't have much money, didn't have much work, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> one room....I was a man in a small room. And I went to the movies a lot, watching Bergman, Antonioni, Godard. When I was little, in the Bronx, I didn't go to the cinema and I didn't think of the American films I saw as works of art. Perhaps, in an indirect way, cinema allowed me to become a writer." [...] DeLillo also credits his parents' leniency and acceptance of his desire to write for encouraging him to pursue a literary career: [...] "They ultimately trusted me to follow the course I’d chosen. This is something that happens if you’re the eldest son in an Italian family: You get a certain leeway, and it worked in my case." ...|$|E
5000|$|While {{he was at}} Imbros {{he seemed}} to enjoy {{speaking}} ancient Greek to {{the inhabitants of the}} island; in one of his letters he wrote: [...] "here <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> a Greek village and talking the language of Demosthenes to the inhabitants (who are really quite clever at taking my meaning)." ...|$|R

2500|$|In early January 2013, Willie Frazer {{said that}} he and a group of loyalists planned to hold a protest outside the Irish {{parliament}} building, Leinster House, in Dublin and [...] "sarcastically" [...] ask for the Irish flag to be taken down. Frazer said [...] "it's a tongue-in-cheek gesture. It's to give Irish people a sense of how we feel. I would be very offended if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Ireland and someone came and asked me to take the flag down. That’s exactly how we feel in Belfast. People keep telling us we're still part of the UK, yet here we are without a flag". In 2006, a march in Dublin, organised by Love Ulster, had sparked riots. The Progressive Unionist Party's Billy Hutchinson condemned the clashes, while his colleague, Phil Hamilton, criticised the PSNI for not deploying enough officers to the Short Strand area on 12 January to prevent violence. The UDA's Jimmy Birch told the BBCs Radio Ulster: [...] "Every time they call a tune, we take to the streets. We are wrecking our own areas, we fight with the police, we are burning our own cars and we stop our own people going to work and disrupt our own people's way of life. It is wrong, we need to step back and we need to stop being predictable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Named after a 1945 book {{of graphic}} {{black and white}} {{photographs}} by Weegee the band performed an aggressive mix of [...] "soundtrack themes, bluesy hard bop, speedy hardcore rock, squealing free jazz [...] metallic funk". Zorn stated that [...] "Naked City started with rhythm and blues/Spillane type things then went into this hard-core thing... because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Japan and experiencing a lot of alienation and rejection... My interest in hard-core also spurred the urge to write shorter and shorter pieces." [...] This approach culminated {{in a string of}} [...] "hardcore miniatures", intense brief compositions often lasting less than a minute, 42 of which were featured on the EP, Torture Garden (1989). Some of these tracks had also featured on the band's debut Naked City and others would resurface on the band's next full-length release, Grand Guignol (1992), which also included performances of works by Claude Debussy, Alexander Scriabin, Orlande de Lassus, Charles Ives, and Olivier Messiaen. [...] The band's third album, Heretic (1992), featured more of these short improvisations produced for the soundtrack of an underground S/M film Jeux des Dames Cruelles. The band released a second EP, Leng Tch'e, in 1992 featuring a single composition which lasted just over half an hour. Radio, released in 1993, was the first Naked City album composed solely by Zorn, and featured tracks crediting a wide range of musical influences.|$|E
2500|$|... "Antique Sandy" [...] was {{the result}} of a songwriting {{experiment}} between all four members of The Byrds and their percussionist/road manager Jimmi Seiter. [...] The song's inspiration was Seiter's then girlfriend, who did indeed live in the woods in a house full of antiques, as the song's lyrics indicate. [...] The Bob Rafkin-penned [...] "Lazy Waters" [...] featured a melodramatic lead vocal from Battin, which was enhanced during the song's refrain by The Byrds' trademark crystal clear harmonies. [...] Despite being a cover, the song's wistful yearning for the simpler days of a bucolic childhood had personal significance for Battin, as he explained during a 1979 interview: [...] "'Lazy Waters' was a serious song. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the Mendocino woods and working on the road. I'd known the song a long time. It expressed my feelings about life in the country and life on the road." [...] The band also elected to cover The Fiestas' 1959 hit single [...] "So Fine" [...] on the album, at the suggestion of Clarence White. [...] The addition of [...] "So Fine", along with other rock 'n' roll-influenced songs, such as [...] "Tiffany Queen", [...] "Get Down Your Line", and [...] "B.B. Class Road", provided the album with a 1950s-flavored thematic unity. [...] The final track on Farther Along was a Gene Parsons and Clarence White-penned bluegrass instrumental titled [...] "Bristol Steam Convention Blues". [...] The song had been inspired by Parsons' frustration and disappointment at having narrowly missed the Bristol Steam Convention during both of The Byrds' last two visits to England.|$|E

2500|$|Frontman James Veck-Gilodi {{has spoken}} {{at length about}} the themes of each song on the album, {{describing}} them as 'very personal and each is a small story that depicts {{a part of my}} life'. Much of the album is about nostalgia, underachievement and anxiety, which are all topics which are personal to him as he wrote all the lyrics for the album. The opening track [...] "The Past Six Years", from whose lyrics the album takes its title, is described as 'an ode to... not really achieving as much as we'd have liked'. The lyrics make reference to friends and fellow bands Lower Than Atlantis and Young Guns and how James feels 'a perpetual bitterness and jealousy towards them in terms of their achievements, {{despite the fact that they}} are close friends'. [...] "I'm a Bore, Mostly" [...] also deals with the topic of underachievement, with James explaining that the song is about 'the mundane daily routine I had when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> London. ...I couldn't deal with city life, I rarely left the house and found myself sinking into this terrible routine. I didn't really appreciate anything at the time and I had no enthusiasm'. He has claimed he wrote the song [...] "Filthy Rotten Scoundrel" [...] about himself; 'I need to learn to be grateful and appreciate the opportunities that I have been given. It's also about my fear of living, dying and never really achieving anything'. [...] "The World or Nothing" [...] continues this trend, with James describing the theme as 'the vicious cycle of feeling lost and resorting to the aid of alcohol while also feeling lost because of alcohol. It talks about how self-destructive a lot of us are and how we enjoy abusing our bodies'. Of [...] "Nelson's County", Veck-Gilodi has said: 'This song is about the county of Norfolk and how a lot of the people who reside there seem to have no real ambition other than working a 9-5, raising a family and living a normal life'.|$|E
