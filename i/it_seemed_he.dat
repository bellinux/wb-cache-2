5|$|The Rock {{lost the}} WWF Championship to Angle at No Mercy in October. Around this time, The Rock feuded with Rikishi and {{defeated}} him at Survivor Series. The Rock wrestled a six-man Hell in a Cell {{match for the}} WWF Championship at Armageddon, which Kurt Angle won to retain the title. On December 18 on Raw, The Rock won the WWF Tag Team Championship with The Undertaker, defeating Edge and Christian, then losing it back to them the next night at a SmackDown! taping. In 2001, The Rock continued to feud with Angle over the WWF Championship, culminating at No Way Out in February, where he pinned Angle to win the WWF Championship for a sixth time. The Rock then feuded with the Royal Rumble winner, Stone Cold Steve Austin, whom he lost the title at WrestleMania X-Seven after Austin allied with Mr. McMahon, who interfered on his behalf. On the next night's Raw Is War, during a steel cage title rematch, Triple H came to the ring with a sledgehammer and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>he</b> would help The Rock, because of the rivalry between Austin and Triple H (and an argument with McMahon earlier in the night), but he attacked him instead, allying with McMahon and Austin. Austin and Triple H formed a tag team called The Power Trip, while The Rock was indefinitely suspended. Johnson used this time off {{to act in the}} movie The Mummy Returns.|$|E
25|$|Augusta {{buried her}} {{differences}} with Bismarck {{only after the}} war, as <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>he</b> was the only suitable man to support her beloved grandson, Wilhelm (William). However, the younger Wilhelm disliked Bismarck and soon forced him to resign {{during the first few}} years of his own reign.|$|E

But weeks before the team departed for India, Ervine re-thought his decision and pulled out opting {{for the safety of}} a county contract rather the uncertainty that would come with returning to the country of his birth.|$|E

25|$|After {{announcing his}} {{intentions}} to not renew his contract, Whatmore was not {{linked with the}} job of national cricket coaches of India in any way {{the same goes for}} England and Pakistan. But England named Peter Moores as their new coach while India appointed Ravi Shastri as the temporary national coach. Since Shastri declared that he was not interested in the job long-term, Whatmore was considered as a strong contender for the role of coach. During India's 2007 tour of Bangladesh, talks took place between him and BCCI officials, and although <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>he</b> was the favourite to get the job, on 4 June 2007, BCCI treasurer N Srinivasan, a member of the Search Committee announced that Graham Ford and John Emburey had been invited for talks, hinting that Dav Whatmore was not under consideration anymore.|$|E
25|$|Kelly won the Giro di Lombardia for a {{third time}} in 1991 but started 1992 {{regarded}} as past his prime. He moved to Festina and prepared for Milan–San Remo. Race favourite Moreno Argentin attacked from the leading group on the final climb, the Poggio. He broke clear after several attempts and reached the top eight seconds before the rest. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>he</b> {{was on his way to}} a solo victory as the peloton descended the Poggio, where Maurizio Fondriest led, marked by Argentin's teammate Rolf Sørensen. Kelly was behind these two in third position. Kelly attacked with three kilometres of descending left. Sorensen could not hold his acceleration and Kelly got away. He caught Argentin with a kilometre to go. Both stalled, the chasers closing fast, Argentin gesturing to Kelly to take the front. Kelly stayed on Argentin's wheel. The two moved again, preparing for a sprint; Kelly launched himself and in the final 200m came past Argentin to win his final classic.|$|E
25|$|At the 2004 Olympic Games Drăgulescu {{helped his}} team to a bronze medal and was a forerunner in the all around event until a mistake on the high bar, after which he still thrilled the crowd with a {{difficult}} routine. He won silver in the men's floor only after a tiebreaker was needed with gold medalist Kyle Shewfelt. On the men's vault he performed the exceptionally difficult vault {{that bears his name}} (a handspring double front with half turn) and received a 9.9, the highest score awarded in World or Olympic competition since 1995. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>he</b> needed only to land his second vault to take gold, but he fell. However Drăgulescu was still awarded the bronze, a controversial decision because the disparity between the judges scores was greater than is permitted and therefore some or all of them should have been altered. They were not, and Shewfelt was pushed into fourth place. The Canadian federation filed a protest, but the result stood. In 2005 the judges involved were suspended for one year.|$|E

500|$|On June 15, 1953, Houtteman {{was traded}} by the Tigers, along with Owen Friend, Joe Ginsberg and Bill Wight, to the Cleveland Indians for Ray Boone, Al Aber, Steve Gromek and Dick Weik. In July 1953, he {{returned}} to Detroit to pitch against the Tigers. At the time, Houtteman admitted {{he wanted to be}} traded. [...] He said, [...] "The fans are down on me and I'd do everybody a lot more good by being traded". He was not content with the Tigers and said there were times when <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>he</b> [...] "couldn't wait to peel off his uniform after a game". As a result of Indians' pitching coach Mel Harder doing a [...] "complete" [...] overhaul, Houtteman was moved into the starting rotation, to replace Bob Feller. Houtteman finished the season in Cleveland with a 7–7 record, six complete games, one shutout, 109 innings pitched, and a 3.80 ERA.|$|E
500|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1930, Tombaugh's search had reached the constellation of Gemini. On 18 February 1930, after searching {{for nearly a year}} and examining nearly 2million stars, Tombaugh discovered a moving object on photographic plates taken on 23 January and 29 January of that year. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 confirmed the movement. Upon confirmation, Tombaugh walked into Slipher's office and declared, [...] "Doctor Slipher, I have found your PlanetX." [...] The object lay just six degrees from one of two locations for PlanetX [...] Lowell had suggested; thus <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>he</b> had at last been vindicated. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930. The new object was later precovered on photographs dating back to 19 March 1915. The decision to name the object Pluto was intended in part to honour Percival Lowell, as his initials made up the word's first two letters. After discovering Pluto, Tombaugh continued to search the ecliptic for other distant objects. He found hundreds of variable stars and asteroids, as well as two comets, but no further planets.|$|E
500|$|Major General Wilhelm D. Styer, the Chief of Staff of the Army Service Forces, {{decided that}} Marshall would be {{replaced}} by Nichols. Marshall {{would be replaced}} given an overseas posting. He was informed by Nichols on June; to him <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "getting fired", although he had previously {{expressed a desire to}} Groves for just such an overseas assignment. Indeed, when first assigned to the project, both Nichols and Groves had also have expressed a preference for an overseas combat assignment. Nichols had [...] "liked working for him and was happy to have him as a buffer between Groves and myself", because Groves was [...] "abrasive and often very critical". Marshall asked Nichols to transfer his secretary, Virginia Olsson, to Oak Ridge when the Manhattan District headquarters moved there, leaving Nichols's own secretary, Anne Phillips, in the New York office. [...] "This concern for personnel", Nichols noted, [...] "was typical of Marshall". Since the Manhattan District had been officially created on 13 August 1942, Marshall chose to formally leave on 13 August 1943, so that he had held the job for exactly one year.|$|E

2500|$|Kirwan's {{reaction}} was initially one of surprise, and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>he</b> had little {{idea of how}} alienated from the other band members he had become, but shortly afterwards he met up with his replacement Bob Weston. Weston described the meeting: [...] "He was aware that I was taking over, and rather sarcastically wished me {{the best of luck}} – then paused and added, 'You're gonna need it.' I read between the lines that he was pretty angry with the band." ...|$|E
2500|$|American Horse {{was about}} ten {{years old when he}} was {{attacked}} by three Crow warriors, while driving a herd of ponies to water. [...] Here he displayed native cunning and initiative. [...] <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>he</b> had scarcely a chance to escape, for the enemy was near. [...] He yelled frantically at the ponies to start them toward home, while he dropped off into a thicket of willows and hid there. [...] A part of the herd was caught in sight of the camp and there was a counter chase, but the Crows got away with the ponies. [...] Of course, his mother was frantic, believing her boy had been killed or captured. But after the excitement was over, he appeared in camp unhurt. [...] When questioned about his escape, he remarked: [...] "I knew they would not take the time to hunt for small game when there was so much bigger close by." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hick {{began the}} 1998 season slowly and was {{left out of}} the England team {{at the start of the}} year, but he responded with four {{hundreds}} in successive first-class innings in late May and early June. Although this form left him somewhat thereafter, he was nevertheless selected for the final two Tests against South Africa. A total of nine runs from three innings left his hopes of a place on the Ashes tour looking extremely shaky, but after two half-centuries in ODIs and then 107 in the one-off Test against Sri Lanka <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>he</b> might have done just enough. However, his century was outshone by John Crawley's 156 in the same innings and in the end it was the Lancashire man who got the nod. Hick was left at home, to console himself with the memory of the adulation of the Worcestershire crowd: in May at New Road he had made his hundredth first-class century.|$|E
