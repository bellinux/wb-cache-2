5|$|On March 22, 2005, NASA {{released}} {{news that}} infrared light <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> had been {{measured by the}} Spitzer Space Telescope, the first ever direct detection of light from an extrasolar planet. This was done by subtracting the parent star's constant light and noting the difference as the planet transited {{in front of the}} star and was eclipsed behind it, providing a measure of the light <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> itself. New measurements from this observation determined the planet's temperature as at least 750°C (1300°F). The circular orbit of HD 209458 b was also confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Alien Spidy has {{a minimal}} plot. The story follows the Spidy, a spider <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> Aracnia, who has crash-landed on Earth during {{an attempt to}} rescue a lady spider, Virgi. Spidy must locate Virgi and collect pieces of his {{spacecraft}} in order to return to Aracnia.|$|E
5|$|Amalthea radiates {{slightly}} more heat than it receives from the Sun, {{which is probably}} due to the influence of Jovian heat flux (<9 kelvin), sunlight reflected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> (<5K), and charged particle bombardment (<2 K). This is a trait shared with Io, although for different reasons.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the other}} races {{developed}} were Grunts, or Unggoy (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> Balaho), viewed in game's fiction as cannon fodder. Depicted as squat and cowardly fighters, Grunts panic and run {{if a player}} or an NPC kills their leaders.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Phobos is below {{synchronous}} altitude, the tidal forces <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> Mars are gradually lowering its orbit. In about 50 million years, it could either crash into Mars's surface or break up into a ring structure around the planet.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the main}} rings at a {{distance}} of 12 million km <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> is the sparse Phoebe ring, which is tilted at an angle of 27° to the other rings and, like Phoebe, orbits in retrograde fashion.|$|E

5|$|Cometary orbits around Jupiter are unstable, as {{they will}} be highly {{elliptical}} and likely to be strongly perturbed by the Sun's gravity at apojove (the furthest point on the orbit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet).</b>|$|E
5|$|Frederik Pohl {{dedicated}} {{the anthology}} Tales <b>From</b> <b>The</b> <b>Planet</b> Earth to Zajdel and A. Bertram Chandler. This book also contains the English translation {{of one of}} Zajdel's short stories, Particularly Difficult Territory. It is his only work to have been translated into English to date (as of August 2015).|$|E
5|$|In 2014, a {{magnetic}} field around HD 209458 b was inferred from the way hydrogen was evaporating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> It is the first (indirect) detection of {{a magnetic}} field on an exoplanet. The magnetic field {{is estimated to be}} about one tenth as strong as Jupiter's.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to basic troops, there are Hunters, or Mgalekgolo, (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> Te) who according to Bungie's mythology are collectives of worm-like aliens, singularly known as Lekgolo, encased in tough armor. Initial concepts were less humanoid-looking and softer than the final shape, with angular shields and razor-sharp spines.|$|E
5|$|The Inuit group {{includes}} five prograde outer moons {{that are similar}} enough in their distances <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> (186–297 radii of Saturn), their orbital inclinations (45–50°) and their colors {{that they can be}} considered a group. The moons are Ijiraq, Kiviuq, Paaliaq, Siarnaq, and Tarqeq. The largest among them is Siarnaq with an estimated size of about 40km.|$|E
5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as seen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> Earth) {{is a type}} of eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E
500|$|Completion of {{the orbital}} {{insertion}} placed the orbiter {{in a highly}} elliptical polar orbit with a period of approximately 35.5 hours.

50|$|Completion of {{the orbital}} {{insertion}} placed the orbiter {{in a highly}} elliptical polar orbit with a period of approximately 35.5 hours. Shortly after insertion, the periapsis - {{the point in the}} orbit closest to Mars - was 426 km <b>from</b> <b>the</b> surface (3,806 km <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> center). <b>The</b> apoapsis - the point in <b>the</b> orbit farthest <b>from</b> Mars - was 44,500 km <b>from</b> <b>the</b> surface (47,972 km <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> center).|$|R
5|$|Another {{addition}} to the fighting force debuting in Halo 2 were Drones, or Yanme'e (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> Palamok); the animators found the creatures challenging, as {{they had to be}} animated to walk, run, crawl, or fly on multiple surfaces. Old concept art from Combat Evolved was re-purposed in influencing the Drone's final shape, which took cues from cockroaches, grasshoppers, and wasps.|$|E
5|$|At about 75 Jupiter radii <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet,</b> the {{interaction}} of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath—a region between it and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|At the {{subsolar point}} the bow shock stands 1900km (0.3 Rv, where Rv is the radius of Venus) {{above the surface}} of Venus. This {{distance}} was measured in 2007 near the solar activity minimum. Near the solar activity maximum it can be several times further <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> The magnetopause {{is located at the}} altitude of 300km. The upper boundary of the ionosphere (ionopause) is near 250km. Between the magnetopause and ionopause there exists a magnetic barrier—a local enhancement of the magnetic field, which prevents solar plasma from penetrating deeper into the Venusian atmosphere, at least near solar activity minimum. The magnetic field in the barrier reaches up to 40nT. The magnetotail continues up to ten radiuses <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> It is the most active part of the Venusian magnetosphere. There are reconnection events and particle acceleration in the tail. The energies of electrons and ions in the magnetotail are around 100eV and 1000eV respectively.|$|E

5|$|HAT-P-33b has an orbital {{inclination}} of 86.7º as seen <b>from</b> Earth. <b>The</b> <b>planet</b> is, thus, almost edge-on when seen <b>from</b> Earth. <b>The</b> <b>planet</b> {{has been observed}} to transit its host star.|$|R
50|$|The thrust that a {{magnetic}} sail delivers within a magnetosphere decreases with the fourth power of its distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> internal magnetic dynamo.|$|R
5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is {{a falling}} block puzzle video game {{developed}} by Compile {{and published by}} Sega. It was released for the Genesis/Mega Drive in North America and Europe in November 1993, and was ported to the Game Gear and Master System in December 1993 and June 1994, respectively. The plot revolves around Sonic the Hedgehog series antagonist Doctor Robotnik kidnapping residents from Beanville and turning them into robots, {{with the purpose of}} removing all joy <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> Mobius.|$|E
5|$|His {{works have}} been {{translated}} into Belorussian, Bulgarian, Czech, Esperanto, Finnish, German, Hungarian, Russian and Slovenian. Almost none of his works have {{been translated into}} English; the only exception is the short story Wyjątkowo trudny teren ("Particularly Difficult Territory") that Zajdel wrote for the English language Tales <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Planet</b> Earth anthology edited by Frederik Pohl and Elizabeth Anne Hull.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, it {{was found}} that the {{variation}} of radio emissions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.|$|E
50|$|Basalt is also {{a common}} rock {{on the surface of}} Mars, as {{determined}} by data sent back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> surface, and by Martian meteorites.|$|R
