25|$|Two {{attributes}} of God that place him above the world, yet acknowledge {{his involvement in}} the world, are transcendence and immanence. Transcendence means that God is eternal and infinite, not controlled by the created world and beyond human events. Immanence means that God is involved in the world, and Christian teachings have long acknowledged his attention to human affairs. However, unlike pantheistic religions, in Christianity God's being <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> substance of the created universe.|$|E

The blue poppy (national flower of Bhutan) {{was the source}} of an ecological mystery for nearly a century, due to its misclassification as Meconopsis grandis. In 2017, after three years of field work and taxonomic studies, its classification was corrected by Bhutanese and Japanese researchers. The problem may have originally arisen due to the now understood finding that some Himalayan flora readily hybridize with each other and produce viable seeds, causing wider (and unknown) morphological diversity.|$|E

There is also the Rinne Sharingan, the primeval form of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan, and the Tenseigan, a heightened form of Byakugan which is very similar to the Rinnegan in power.
