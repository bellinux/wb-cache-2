Inscriptions in some vessels indicate that as early as the Shang Dynasty, the king would give bronze vessels as gifts to deserving vassals. By 900 BCE other officials had adapted this custom. Bronzes of all types, including Hu, were given for a variety of occasions: as wedding gifts, <b>funeral</b> <b>items,</b> travel tokens, and even to commemorate real estate dealings.|$|E
50|$|After Li LInfu's death, Emperor Xuanzong {{initially}} awarded him {{a number}} of posthumous honors, including ordering a grand funeral with imperial guards serving as honor guards {{and the use of}} royal <b>funeral</b> <b>items.</b> However, in spring 753, Yang Guozhong induced An Lushan into accusing Li Linfu of having been complicit with Li Xianzhong's rebellion, and then had Li Linfu's son-in-law Yang Qixuan (楊齊宣) corroborate this. Before Li Linfu's funeral could be held, Emperor Xuanzong issued an edict stripping all of his honors and exiling his descendants. Li Linfu's casket was split open, and three of the funereal honors—the pearl in his mouth, the purple robe of chancellorship, and the golden fish to show rank—were stripped, and he was instead buried with ceremony fit for a mere commoner, in a small casket. It was said that while the people hated Li Linfu for his corrupt and harsh reign, they nevertheless mourned at how he was falsely accused after his death. After Li Heng later became emperor (as Emperor Suzong), he considered further infliction of humiliation on Li Linfu's body—by exhuming and burning it and scattering the ashes. At the suggestion of the imperial advisor Li Mi, however, he did not do so.|$|E
50|$|The {{periodical}} {{exhibition is}} housed {{on the third}} floor and is named “Psara in Antiquity”. It contains artifacts such as vases, gold jewelry, terracotta figurines and <b>funeral</b> gift <b>items.</b> The Psara collection was found at the Mycenaean Necropolis of Archontiki on Psara Island.Of major note is a prehistoric vase found in Emporio, dated back to the 14th century B.C., geometric amphoras found in the town of Chios, dated to the 8th century B.C. and golden leaves unearthed in a grave at the town of Chios, dated back to the Hellenistic period.|$|R
50|$|Of course, Allde also {{printed a}} wide variety of non-dramatic works of {{virtually}} all types then in circulation. He worked on a few of the pamphlets of Samuel Rowlands, including The Knave of Clubs (1611) and the evocatively-titled Look to It for I'll Stab Ye (1604). Allde printed topical works like Henry Petowe's Elizabetha Quasi Vivens: Eliza's <b>Funeral</b> (1603), an <b>item</b> in the mourning literature for Queen Elizabeth I. For Cuthbert Burby, Allde printed the sixth volume of The Mirror of Knighthood (1598), the vast, and vastly popular, chivalric romance {{that was one of the}} greatest best-sellers of the age. For John Tappe, he printed an early attempt at juvenile literature, Nicholas Breton's The Passionate Shepherd...With many excellent conceited Poems and pleasant Sonnets, fit for young heads to pass away idle hours (1604).|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{correspondence}} in late 1917 {{relates to the}} War Risk Insurance project Straight was assigned to administer in France. Letters document a controversy with Washington officials over details of his plan of operation. A letter from Shanghai on November eighth concerns Straight's business interest in China and refers to his proposal to buy back his old Peking house. Croly and A. W. Fiedler, Straight's secretary, reported on home-front matters in 1918, and Straight wrote frequent and detailed letters to his wife. In early February he wrote recommendations for members of his insurance staff, {{as he prepared to}} leave the project and enroll in the army staff college at Langres. On 13 February he complained to James A. Logan that the army was "controlled by men too long a part of the regular army peacetime machinery, not flexible enough [...] . to solve wartime problems of transport and communication. " On the same day he wrote his wife that he had come to believe in universal service and "a changing, not a permanent, personnel. " A memorandum from General William Mason Wright of the Fifth Army Corps on 29 July 1918 enclosed several officers' comments on the liaison pamphlet Straight prepared. The last word from Straight is a long cable to Croly on November seventh urging sup¬port for Wilson and the League of Nations. Straight died of pneumonia in Paris on December first, a victim of the 1918 - 1919 influenza pandemic. The remainder of {{the correspondence}} is addressed to Mrs. Straight, though most of it concerns him. First are a group of letters addressed to her before his death, 1910 - 1918. These are followed by a list of callers at the Hotel Crillon at the time of Straight's death and <b>funeral.</b> The last <b>items</b> on the reel are a group of cables and telegrams sent in December and the first of some 800 letters of condolence...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the development of}} English funerals through the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. By using a large new sample of Prerogative Court of Canterbury (PCC) probate accounts, the study demonstrates how the funerals of the aristocracy, gentry, and the middling sort interacted and changed over this period, through a detailed investigation into the commodities and services provided at their funerals and the pattern of expenditure. It also explores {{the activity of the}} College of Arms and the work of undertakers in the same period. While most historians have argued that middle class funerals saw increased consumption, the records of funeral expenditure show that it was the aristocracy and gentry whose spending behaviour changed the most. The main reasons for this were an institutional change, the decline of the College of Arms in the late seventeenth century, and the expansion of the undertaking trade over the next hundred years. The College’s loss of control over the funerals of the aristocracy and gentry allowed these groups to opt for a heraldic funeral prepared by an undertaker, at a much lower price. For the middling sort, the undertakers created new value chains allowing them to achieve a different kind of funeral. By offering expensive <b>funeral</b> <b>items</b> for hire rather than selling them, undertakers enabled people to have a lavish funeral without massive expense. While heraldic items were still limited to aristocratic and gentry funerals, a close connection emerged between the concept of ‘decency’ and the use of more beautiful and more sophisticated items at the funeral and the grave. The findings in this thesis help us to widen our understanding of funeral changes as a whole, as well as changes in consumption patterns occurring in a period of important transformation in England...|$|E
40|$|Brittany can pride {{itself on}} the Armorican arrowheads found in Early Bronze Age graves (2150 - 1700 BC). In {{the present state of}} knowledge, these are the only {{specialized}} craft products in knapped flint produced in this region at the western edge of continental Europe. Admired since the 19 th century, these flint arrowheads have never really been studied. Due to the wealth of graves and grave-goods, a relatively precise study can be undertaken of the development of these craft products, despite the low number of reliable radiocarbon dates. These arrowheads are characterized by a well-defined type (pointed tang and oblique barbs) most often combined with ogival form. Raw materials show the selection of a high quality yellow translucent flint, of which the origin has to be sought at more than 400 kilometers (Lower Turonian flint from Cher Valley). From a technical point of view, Armorican arrowheads reveal a great mastery of retouch by pressure-flaking. This skill is written in stone by the perfection of forms, the extreme thinness (until 2, 5 mm thick) and very long barbs (until 25 mm long). Such work could not have been done without the use of copper, even bronze, awls. Moreover, some marks may testify to the implication of these tools. On 549 arrowheads that have reached to us, none of them presents diagnostical impact features. However, use-wear analysis indicates that most of them were hafted (adhesive traces, bright spots, blunt edges). These facts suggest that they are less functional arrowheads than objects for the show. In the graves, Armorican arrowheads are frequently set down carefully in wooden boxes taking the shaft off. The Armorican arrowheads with their exotic raw materials, their high-degree of technicality, and their absence of use, have all features of a prestige good. They have been discovered by dozens in few graves under barrows with very rich <b>funeral</b> <b>items</b> (bronze daggers decorated with golden pins, precious bracers, silver beakers, etc.). According to these obvious facts, they symbolize the power of the elites. The genesis of Armorican arrowheads are in all likelihood explained by a climate of increasing social competition, which express itself in Brittany by an individualization of burial rites, a development of metalworking and a reorganization of territories. In this article, we will stress on raw materials selection, technology and know-how, as well as use-wear analyses. All these approaches will help us to trace the biographies of the Armorican arrowheads. </p...|$|E
