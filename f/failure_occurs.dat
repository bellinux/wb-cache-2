5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} {{typically}} treated with dietary changes and medication. Dietary changes involve eating a low copper diet and not using copper cookware. Medications used include chelating agents such as trientine and d-penicillamine and zinc supplements. Complications of Wilson's disease can include liver failure, liver cancer, and kidney problems. A liver transplant {{may be helpful}} in those in whom other treatments are not effective or if liver <b>failure</b> <b>occurs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Integration {{failure is}} rare, {{particularly}} if a dentist's or oral surgeon's instructions are {{followed closely by}} the patient. Immediate loading implants may have {{a higher rate of}} failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration <b>failure</b> <b>occurs</b> when a patient is either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including smoking or drug use.|$|E
5|$|The V-22's two Rolls-Royce AE 1107C {{engines are}} {{connected}} by drive shafts {{to a common}} central gearbox so that one engine can power both proprotors if an engine <b>failure</b> <b>occurs.</b> Either engine can power both proprotors through the wing driveshaft. However, the V-22 is generally not capable of hovering on one engine. If a proprotor gearbox fails, that proprotor cannot be feathered, and both engines must be stopped before an emergency landing. The V-22's autorotation characteristics are poor partly because the rotors have low inertia.|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{information}} {{relating to}} the number of gas turbine engine rotor <b>failures</b> which <b>occurred</b> during 1979 in commercial aviation service use is provided. The predominant failure mode involved blade fragments, 84 percent of which were contained. No uncontained disk <b>failures</b> <b>occurred</b> and although fewer rotor rim and seal <b>failures</b> <b>occurred,</b> 100 percent and 50 percent, respectively, were uncontained. Sixty-eight percent of the 157 rotor <b>failures</b> <b>occurred</b> during the take-off and climb stages of flight...|$|R

30|$|Complete <b>failures</b> <b>occur</b> {{when the}} {{developers}} {{are unable to}} identify any design problem with Organic and do not try again. Partial <b>failures</b> <b>occur</b> when the developer gives up from using Organic’s functionalities before identifying any design problem and tries to achieve this in another way. Finally, temporary <b>failures</b> <b>occur</b> when the developer temporarily interrupts the identification of design problems with Organic due to some communicability issue. According to the CEM, there are three types of temporary failures: (1) trying to communicate, (2) trying to fix an error, and (3) {{trying to understand the}} rules.|$|R
5|$|Wobble or shimmy {{begins when}} some {{otherwise}} minor irregularity, such as fork asymmetry, accelerates {{the wheel to}} one side. The restoring force is applied in phase with {{the progress of the}} irregularity, and the wheel turns to the other side where the process is repeated. If there is insufficient damping in the steering the oscillation will increase until system <b>failure</b> <b>occurs.</b> The oscillation frequency can be changed by changing the forward speed, making the bike stiffer or lighter, or increasing the stiffness of the steering, of which the rider is a main component.|$|E
5|$|Stage 3 (24 to 72 hours) {{kidney failure}} {{is the result}} of {{ethylene}} glycol poisoning. In cats, this stage occurs 12–24 hours after getting into antifreeze; in dogs, at 36–72 hours after getting into antifreeze. During this stage, severe kidney failure is developing secondary to calcium oxalate crystals forming in the kidneys. Severe lethargy, coma, depression, vomiting, seizures, drooling, and inappetance may be seen. Other symptoms include acute tubular necrosis, red blood cells in the urine, excess proteins in the urine, lower back pain, decreased or absent production of urine, elevated blood concentration of potassium, and acute kidney failure. If kidney <b>failure</b> <b>occurs</b> it is typically reversible, although weeks or months of supportive care including hemodialysis may be required before kidney function returns.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{analysis}} is {{the branch of}} mechanical engineering (and also civil engineering) devoted to examining why and how objects fail and to fix the objects and their performance. Structural failures occur in two general modes: static failure, and fatigue failure. Static structural <b>failure</b> <b>occurs</b> when, upon being loaded (having a force applied) the object being analyzed either breaks or is deformed plastically, depending on the criterion for failure. Fatigue <b>failure</b> <b>occurs</b> when an object fails {{after a number of}} repeated loading and unloading cycles. Fatigue <b>failure</b> <b>occurs</b> because of imperfections in the object: a microscopic crack {{on the surface of the}} object, for instance, will grow slightly with each cycle (propagation) until the crack is large enough to cause ultimate failure.|$|E
50|$|Power Failure Recovery - Should a power <b>failure</b> <b>occur,</b> DNOS {{maintains}} {{the state of}} the system {{at the time of the}} failure, if the optional software and backup power supply have been added to your system. When full power resumes, the operation will continue from the point at which the power <b>failure</b> <b>occurred.</b>|$|R
50|$|Failure of the ETV occurs. This can {{be due to}} {{occlusion}} of the ventriculostomy (e.g. {{closure of}} the ventriculostomy, formation of subarachnoid membranes in the pontine cistern or other mechanisms). Although 60 - 90% of <b>failures</b> <b>occur</b> {{in the first few}} months after treatment, long-term <b>failure</b> also <b>occurs</b> (<b>failures</b> <b>occurring</b> after 7 years have been reported). In a very small subgroup of patients a complication of ETV can be rapid late deterioration. The mechanism is not clear.|$|R

25|$|R. H. Campbell did a {{study on}} shallow {{landslides}} on Santa Cruz Island, California. He notes that if permeability decreases with depth, a perched water table may develop in soils at intense precipitation. When pore water pressures are sufficient to reduce effective normal stress to a critical level, <b>failure</b> <b>occurs.</b>|$|E
25|$|Failure mode is {{the manner}} by which an {{earthquake}} induced failure is observed. It, generally, describes {{the way the}} <b>failure</b> <b>occurs.</b> Though costly and time consuming, learning from each real earthquake failure remains a routine recipe for advancement in seismic design methods. Below, some typical modes of earthquake-generated failures are presented.|$|E

50|$|Cantilever <b>failures</b> <b>occur</b> when an {{overhanging}} blocks collapses {{into the}} channel. <b>Failure</b> often <b>occurs</b> after {{the bank has}} experienced undercutting. Failure is usually in a composite of fine and coarse grained material, and is active during low flow conditions.|$|R

25|$|Painless {{passage of}} blood or protein {{in the urine}} may often be the only {{presenting}} sign of kidney involvement. Acute or chronic renal impairment may develop with lupus nephritis, leading to acute or end-stage kidney failure. Because of early recognition and management of SLE, end-stage renal <b>failure</b> <b>occurs</b> in less than 5% of cases; except in the black population, where the risk is many times higher.|$|E
25|$|The Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) was {{developed}} by Smith et al. (2000) to measure self-reports of prospective and retrospective memory in patients with Alzheimer's disease. It is a questionnaire consisting of 16 items; in which participants rank how often memory <b>failure</b> <b>occurs</b> using a 5-point scale (Very Often, Quite Often, Sometimes, Rarely, and Never). The PRMQ equally assesses three variables: prospective and retrospective memory, short-term memory and long-term memory, and self-cued and environmentally-cued memory.|$|E
25|$|Dam {{failures}} {{are generally}} catastrophic if {{the structure is}} breached or significantly damaged. Routine deformation monitoring and monitoring of seepage from drains in and around larger dams is useful to anticipate any problems and permit remedial {{action to be taken}} before structural <b>failure</b> <b>occurs.</b> Most dams incorporate mechanisms to permit the reservoir to be lowered or even drained in the event of such problems. Another solution can be rock grouting– pressure pumping portland cement slurry into weak fractured rock.|$|E

25|$|Risks and {{complications}} in knee replacement {{are similar}} to those associated with all joint replacements. The most serious complication is infection of the joint, which occurs in <1% of patients. Risk factors for infection are related to both patient and surgical factors. Deep vein thrombosis occurs in up to 15% of patients, and is symptomatic in 2–3%. Nerve injuries occur in 1–2% of patients. Persistent pain or stiffness occurs in 8–23% of patients. Prosthesis <b>failure</b> <b>occurs</b> in approximately 2% of patients at 5 years.|$|E
25|$|Another {{common use}} of a ballast {{resistor}} in the automotive industry is adjusting the ventilation fan speed. The ballast is a fixed resistor with usually two center taps, and the fan speed selector switch is used to bypass portions of the ballast: all of them for full speed, and none for the low speed setting. A very common <b>failure</b> <b>occurs</b> when the fan is being constantly run at the next-to-full speed setting (usually 3 out of 4). This will cause a very short piece of resistor coil to be operated with a relatively high current (up to 10A), eventually burning it out. This will render the fan unable to run at the reduced speed settings.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>failure</b> <b>occurs</b> {{when the}} fill {{at each end}} moves (through {{resonant}} effects) in bulk, in opposite directions. If there is an insufficient founding shelf for the overpass, then it may fall. Additional shelf and ductile stays may be added to attach the overpass to the footings at one or both ends. The stays, rather than being fixed to the beams, may instead be clamped to them. Under moderate loading, these keep the overpass centered in the gap {{so that it is}} less likely to slide off its founding shelf at one end. The ability for the fixed ends to slide, rather than break, will prevent the complete drop of the structure if it should fail to remain on the footings.|$|E

40|$|With {{a service}} life of about 20 years, wind turbine power trains are {{subjected}} to a very diverse spectrum of dynamic loads. Due to {{the high number of}} load cycles which occur during the life of the turbine, fatigue considerations are of particular importance in wind turbine design. Power train bearing <b>failures</b> <b>occur</b> more frequently than damage to the other components. Taking into account that these <b>failures</b> <b>occur</b> t...|$|R

25|$|Acute renal <b>failure</b> <b>occurs</b> in 55–70% of {{patients}} with STEC-HUS, although up to 70–85% recover renal function. Patients with aHUS generally have poor outcomes, with up to 50% progressing to ESRD or irreversible brain damage; as many as 25% die during the acute phase. However, with aggressive treatment, more than 90% {{of patients}} survive the acute phase of HUS, and only about 9% may develop ESRD. Roughly one-third of persons with HUS have abnormal kidney function many years later, and a few require long-term dialysis. Another 8% of persons with HUS have other lifelong complications, such as high blood pressure, seizures, blindness, paralysis, {{and the effects of}} having part of their colon removed. The overall mortality rate from HUS is 5–15%. Children and the elderly have a worse prognosis.|$|E
500|$|TWA company manuals {{indicated}} that aborting a takeoff {{at high speeds}} is dangerous, and should only be attempted if an actual engine <b>failure</b> <b>occurs</b> before V1 speed. [...] "V1" [...] speed is the maximum speed at which the takeoff can be safely aborted; after V1 speed is exceeded, the plane must take off to avoid overrunning the runway. The captain of Flight 159 failed to announce that Flight 159 had achieved V1 speed, and the first officer believed the plane was at or near V1 (rather than having substantially exceeded V1) when he aborted the takeoff. [...] On a Boeing 707, the V1 speed is Flight 159 achieved a peak speed of [...] However, the NTSB determined that V1 was not relevant to this incident because it is only intended to advise pilots on whether they can abort after engine failure, and the first officer believed that his aircraft had been physically damaged and might not be capable of flight. As a result, the NTSB found the first officer's decision to abort was reasonable, but criticized the pilots for failing to execute the abort rapidly. [...] One NTSB board member, Francis H. McAdams, wrote in a separate minority report {{that he would have}} concluded that an abort was both reasonable and necessary under the circumstances, {{despite the fact that the}} aircraft had exceeded V1 and was certain to overrun the runway.|$|E
2500|$|A {{turbine engine}} <b>failure</b> <b>occurs</b> when a turbine engine in an {{aircraft}} unexpectedly stops producing thrust or power production {{due to a}} malfunction other than fuel exhaustion, although the term [...] "turbine engine failure" [...] can also apply to failure of any turbine engine, such as ground based turbines used in power plants, turbine-engined vessels (i.e. CODAG [...] ) and vehicles, etc.|$|E
