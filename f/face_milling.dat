500|$|The {{first major}} {{application}} of [...] was abrasive and cutting tools. Bulk, monolithic silicon nitride {{is used as}} a material for cutting tools, due to its hardness, thermal stability, and resistance to wear. It is especially recommended for high speed machining of cast iron. Hot hardness, fracture toughness and thermal shock resistance mean that sintered silicon nitride can cut cast iron, hard steel and nickel based alloys with surface speeds up to 25 times quicker than those obtained with conventional materials such as tungsten carbide. The use of [...] cutting tools has had a dramatic effect on manufacturing output. For example, <b>face</b> <b>milling</b> of gray cast iron with silicon nitride inserts doubled the cutting speed, increased tool life from one part to six parts per edge, and reduced the average cost of inserts by 50%, as compared to traditional tungsten carbide tools.|$|E

50|$|The <b>face</b> <b>milling</b> {{process can}} in {{principle}} produce very flat surfaces. However, in practice the result always shows visible trochoidal marks following {{the motion of}} points on the cutter's end face. These revolution marks give the characteristic finish of a face milled surface. Revolution marks can have significant roughness depending on factors such as flatness of the cutter's end face {{and the degree of}} perpendicularity between the cutter's rotation axis and feed direction. Often a final pass with a slow feed rate is used to improve the surface finish after the bulk of the material has been removed.. In a precise <b>face</b> <b>milling</b> operation, the revolution marks will only be microscopic scratches due to imperfections in the cutting edge.|$|E

50|$|Cutting tools: Cutting tools include various {{milling cutters}} such as <b>face</b> <b>mills,</b> shell mills, endmills, and form cutters; various drills, reamers, taps, countersinks, counterbores, and core drills; various turning tools, form tools, and {{threading}} tools; various grinding wheels distinguished by their geometry, bond, grit size, and compound.|$|R
40|$|A {{strategy}} is developed for identifying cutting tool wear on a <b>face</b> <b>mill</b> by automatically recognizing wear {{patterns in the}} cutting force signal.

50|$|Many {{different}} types of cutting tools {{are used in the}} milling process. Milling cutters such as endmills may have cutting surfaces across their entire end surface, {{so that they can be}} drilled into the workpiece (plunging).

5000|$|A {{face mill}} is a cutter {{designed}} for facing {{as opposed to}} e.g., creating a pocket (end mills). The cutting edges of face mills are always located along its sides. As such it must always cut in a horizontal direction at a given depth coming from outside the stock. Multiple teeth distribute the chip load, and since the teeth are normally disposable carbide inserts, this combination allows for very large and efficient <b>face</b> <b>milling.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A {{shell mill}} is any of various milling cutters (typically a <b>face</b> <b>mill</b> or endmill) whose {{construction}} takes a modular form, with the shank (arbor) made {{separately from the}} body of the cutter, which is called a [...] "shell" [...] and attaches to the shank/arbor via any of several standardized joining methods.|$|R
50|$|A {{fly cutter}} is {{composed}} of a body into which one or two tool bits are inserted. As the entire unit rotates, the tool bits take broad, shallow facing cuts. Fly cutters are analogous to face mills in that their purpose is <b>face</b> <b>milling</b> and their individual cutters are replaceable. Face mills are more ideal in various respects (e.g., rigidity, indexability of inserts without disturbing effective cutter diameter or tool length offset, depth-of-cut capability), but tend to be expensive, whereas fly cutters are very inexpensive.|$|E
5000|$|In machining, facing is the act {{of cutting}} a face, which is a planar surface, onto the workpiece. Within this {{broadest}} sense there are various specific types of facing, with the two most common being facing {{in the course of}} turning and boring work (facing planes perpendicular to the rotating axis of the workpiece) and facing in the course of milling work (for example, <b>face</b> <b>milling).</b> Other types of machining also cut faces (for example, planing, shaping, and grinding), although the term [...] "facing" [...] may not always be employed there.|$|E
50|$|CNC mills use {{computer}} {{controls to}} cut different materials. They {{are able to}} translate programs consisting of specific numbers and letters to move the spindle (or workpiece) to various locations and depths. Many use G-code, which is a standardized programming language that many CNC machines understand, while others use proprietary languages created by their manufacturers. These proprietary languages, while often simpler than G-code, are not transferable to other machines. CNC mills have many functions including <b>face</b> <b>milling,</b> shoulder milling, tapping, drilling and some even offer turning. Standard linear CNC mills are limited to 3 axis (X, Y, and Z) which allows for 2.5D machining, but others may also have one or more rotational axes which allow for advanced 3D machining. Today, CNC mills can have 3 to 6 axes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper adopts {{composite}} structure system analysis method to perform modal analysis of high-speed <b>face</b> <b>milling</b> cutter which {{is mounted on}} the machine tool through FEM modal analysis. The key problem of this method is to obtain joint surface parameters between the machine tool spindle and <b>face</b> <b>milling</b> cutter through experimental modal analysis and MATLAB software. The joint surface parameters consist of linear stiffness, linear damping, rotation stiffness and rotation damping. After getting the frequency response function (FRF) at the tool tip of the <b>face</b> <b>milling</b> system through experimental modal analysis, the contact surface parameters {{can be used to}} eliminate the influence of the machine tool to get modal parameters of the face-milling cutter itself. Based on the finite element model of <b>face</b> <b>milling</b> cutter, {{composite structure}} system analysis method can be used easily to acquire the dynamic performance of the <b>face</b> <b>milling</b> system through FEM modal analysis, greatly to improve the reliability of modal analysis, and is helpful to the dynamic design and the structure improvement of high speed <b>face</b> <b>milling</b> cutter...|$|E

40|$|Research was {{performed}} to develop a computer program that will: (1) simulate the meshing and bearing contact for <b>face</b> <b>milled</b> spiral beval gears with given machine tool settings; and (2) to obtain the output, some of the data is required for hydrodynamic analysis. It is assumed that the machine tool settings and the blank data will be taken from the Gleason summaries. The theoretical aspects of the program are based on 'Local Synthesis and Tooth Contact Analysis of <b>Face</b> <b>Mill</b> Milled Spiral Bevel Gears'. The difference between the computer programs developed herein {{and the other one}} is as follows: (1) the mean contact point of tooth surfaces for gears with given machine tool settings must be determined iteratively, while parameters (H and V) are changed (H represents displacement along the pinion axis, V represents the gear displacement that is perpendicular to the plane drawn through the axes of the pinion and the gear of their initial positions), this means that when V differs from zero, the axis of the pionion and the gear are crossed but not intersected; (2) in addition to the regular output data (transmission errors and bearing contact), the new computer program provides information about the contacting force for each contact point and the sliding and the so-called rolling velocity. The following topics are covered: (1) instructions for the users as to how to insert the input data; (2) explanations regarding the output data; (3) numerical example; and (4) listing of the program...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{technological}} and economic considerations required to select <b>face</b> <b>milling</b> vs. surface grinding operations {{in the manufacture of}} hardened steel flat surfaces for dies and moulds.
