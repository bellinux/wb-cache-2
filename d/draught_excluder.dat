5000|$|A <b>draught</b> <b>excluder</b> or draft stopper {{is used to}} {{eliminate}} cold draught and slow heat loss. It {{is placed in the}} bottom crack of doors and windows.

5000|$|He drifted {{through a}} series of jobs, before {{becoming}} a Butlins Redcoat at Skegness in a troupe that also included the British jazz trumpeter and writer John Chilton. At the end of each summer season, he did stand-ups at strip clubs and {{for the next four years}} he appeared in night clubs, theatres and working men's clubs. When entertainment work was slow he sold toys in a Sheffield store and also worked as a door-to-door <b>draught</b> <b>excluder</b> salesman. He changed his stage surname to [...] "Allen" [...] on the prompting of his agent, who believed that few people in Britain could pronounce [...] "O'Mahony" [...] correctly. Allen himself hoped that a surname beginning with [...] "A" [...] would put him at the top of any agent's list.|$|E
50|$|Rendering is a {{traditional}} craft that has evolved over many centuries. Basic rendering began {{as a method of}} <b>excluding</b> <b>draughts</b> and rain by using clay to fill in cracks and crevices, referred to as wattle-and-daub. Other renders, based on Lime (material) binders were also used over the years. These materials had one significant disadvantage in that they were not very resistant to water.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{car coat}} was by now a {{familiar}} item, {{it did not}} mean it couldn't be reinvented. Michael Carr, who had designed an ergonomic racing suit for his company's co-director Stirling Moss applied first design principles to add functionality. Made of waterproofed poplin, his design of 1968 featured a zip front and separate velcro quick fasten strip. Buttons were designed so they didn't catch on the car seat belt, gathered cuffs <b>excluded</b> <b>draughts</b> and pockets were designed to fall on the knee while seated in the car. There was also an interior deep pocket for roadmaps. During the 1970s, the car coat {{continued to be a}} wardrobe staple for men, while car coat became a description of cut and length in women's fashion (often looser and always shorter than a traditional coat).|$|R
60|$|At {{first the}} tent was pitched {{in the usual}} way on the ground; {{but one of the}} boys, in a ramble through the camp, had seen an officer's tent {{prepared}} in a way which added greatly to its comfort, and this they at once adopted. Tom Hammond was set to dig a hole of eighteen inches smaller diameter than the circle of the tent. It was three feet in depth, with perpendicular sides. At nine inches from the edge a trench a foot deep was dug. In the centre was an old flour barrel filled with earth. Upon this stood the tent-pole. The tent was brought down so as to extend six inches into the ditch, the nine-inch rim of earth standing inside serving as a shelf on which to put odds and ends. A wall of sods, two feet high, was erected round the outside of the little ditch. Thus a comfortable habitation was formed. The additional three feet of height added greatly {{to the size of the}} tent, as the occupants could now stand near the edges instead of in the centre only. It was much warmer than before at night, and all <b>draught</b> was <b>excluded</b> by the tent overlapping the ditch, and by the wall outside. A short ladder at the entrance enabled them to get in and out.|$|R
60|$|Captain Vere, his {{lieutenant}} and ensign {{and his two}} pages, were quartered in {{the house}} of a wealthy merchant, whose family did all in their power to make them comfortable. It was a grand old house, and the boys, accustomed as they were to the splendours of Hedingham Castle, agreed that the simple merchants of the Low Countries were far in advance of English nobles in the comforts and conveniences of their dwellings. The walls of the rooms were all heavily panelled; rich curtains hung before the casements. The furniture was not only richly carved, but comfortable. Heavy hangings before the doors <b>excluded</b> <b>draughts,</b> and in the principal apartments Eastern carpets covered the floors. The meals were served on spotless white linen. Rich plates stood on the sideboard, and gold and silver vessels of rare carved work from Italy glittered in the armoires.|$|R
