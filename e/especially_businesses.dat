5000|$|After the North Vietnamese {{takeover}} in April 1975, {{one million}} or more people were sent to [...] "re-education" [...] camps, often for several years, and the government attempted to destroy private enterprise, <b>especially</b> <b>businesses</b> owned by the Hoa. In September 1978, 1,220 [...] "boat people" [...] left Vietnam on an old ship and landed in Indonesia. That {{was the beginning of}} a flood of refugees arriving monthly by boat in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and other countries. The number of boat people arriving monthly on foreign shores peaked at 56,000 in June 1979. Most of the boat people left Vietnam in decrepit, leaky, overcrowded boats. They encountered storms, shortages of water and food, and, most seriously, pirates in the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand. Merchant ships encountering boats in distress often refused to pick up the refugees for fear that no country would allow them to unload the refugees. Thai and Malay pirates attacked many of the small boats, raping and kidnapping women and stealing the possessions of the passengers. Authorities of the countries where they arrived often [...] "pushed off" [...] the refugee boats, refusing to allow them to land. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees estimated that between 200,000 and 400,000 boat people died at sea. Other estimates compiled are that 10% to 70% of the 1 -2 million Vietnamese boat people died in transit.|$|E

5000|$|The Free State {{became an}} {{independent}} constitutional monarchy following the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster 1931 and formally became a republic {{with the passage}} of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948. That same year, the republican movement took the decision to focus on Northern Ireland thereafter. The Border Campaign, which lasted from 1956 to 1962, involved bombings and attacks on Royal Ulster Constabulary barracks. The failure of this campaign led the republican leadership to concentrate on political action, and to move to the left. Following the outbreak of The Troubles in 1968-9, the movement split between Officials (leftists) and Provisionals (traditionalists) at the beginning of 1970. Both sides were initially involved in an armed campaign against the British state, but the Officials gradually moved into mainstream politics after the Official IRA ceasefire of 1972; the associated [...] "Official Sinn Féin" [...] eventually renamed itself the Workers' Party. The Provisional IRA, except during brief ceasefires in 1972 and 1975, kept up a campaign of violence for nearly thirty years, directed against security forces and civilian targets (<b>especially</b> <b>businesses).</b> While the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) represented the nationalists of Northern Ireland in initiatives such as the 1973 Sunningdale Agreement, republicans took no part in these, believing that a withdrawal of British troops and a commitment to a united Ireland was a necessary precondition of any settlement. This began to change with a landmark speech by Danny Morrison in 1981, advocating what became known as the Armalite and ballot box strategy. Under the leadership of Gerry Adams, Sinn Féin began to focus on the search for a political settlement. When the party voted in 1986 to take seats in legislative bodies within Ireland, there was a walk-out of die-hard republicans, who set up Republican Sinn Féin and the Continuity IRA. Following the Hume-Adams dialogue, Sinn Féin took part in the Northern Ireland peace process which led to the IRA ceasefires of 1994 and 1997 and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. After elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly, republicans sat in government in Northern Ireland for the first time when Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Brún were elected to the Northern Ireland Executive. However, another split occurred, with anti-Agreement republicans setting up the 32 County Sovereignty Movement and the Real IRA. Today, Irish republicanism is divided between those who support the institutions set up under the Good Friday Agreement and the later St Andrews Agreement, and those who oppose them. The latter are often referred to as [...] "dissident" [...] republicans.|$|E

It’s essential to connect a training alliance between teaching skills and the theme of the educational value of the work, as underlined by the guidelines issued to accompanying decrees, that set up the '"alternation".

40|$|Skyrocketing {{health care}} costs {{in recent years have}} posed {{challenges}} for all businesses, but small firms and their workers are at a particular disadvantage. Declines in insurance coverage among workers in small businesses (<b>especially</b> <b>businesses</b> with less than 10 workers) have driven much of the drop in employer-sponsored health insurance coverage nationwide. It is no surprise then that the effect of health reform on small business has become a flashpoint in the ongoing health reform debate. This brief highlights the challenges faced by small businesses and the positive effect of Senate Majority Leader Reid’s health reform bill (as released on November 18, 2009) on the ability of small firms to provide quality, affordable insurance coverage to their workers. It concludes by reviewing evidence from the Congressional Budget Office that shows major savings for many small businesses and their workers. This brief documents the burden that small businesses face in providing health insurance coverage for their workers: Small firms are less likely to offer health insurance to their workers than larger firms. It is dwindling coverage in small firms that is driving much of the national decline in workplace insurance coverage. Low coverage rates among small firms are due to many elements that make purchasing insurance much more expensive for small businesses than for larger firms, including an inability to offer attractive risk pools to potential insurers, high administrative and loading costs, and little competition in insurer markets. This brief also finds {{that the vast majority of}} small businesses stand to gain from the legislation currently being considered by the Senate, and that small businesses as a group are some of the largest winners from health reform.

40|$|Although {{much has}} been written {{concerning}} the application of ethics to famine relief, absolute poverty and environmental degradation, few have adequately attended to the role that institutions play in helping to perpetuate and/or resolve these problems. I provide evidence for thinking that there is a significant gap in discussions of applied ethics with respect to the moral role played by institutions as such. I then argue that this problem can best be dealt with by gaining a better understanding of collective moral agency. I argue that rationality, intentionality, and the capacity to respond appropriately to punishment (or to develop such a capacity) are jointly sufficient for moral agency. Since companies and other sufficiently organizes collectives bear these three traits, I conclude that they are in fact moral agencies of a sort. Many would object to the claim that these three features are jointly sufficient for moral agency or would deny that collectives can have such traits. In response to these objections, which are often rooted in broader theoretical commitments, I maintain that regarding sufficiently organized collectives as if they were moral agencies of a sort is at the very least a highly useful fiction with many practical benefits. ^ After establishing that sufficiently organized collectives ought {{to be thought of as}} moral agencies, I consider the sorts of virtues appropriate to collective agencies and <b>especially</b> <b>businesses.</b> I contend that consistency in acting according to recognized norms, the development of conscience, and appropriate response to censure are crucial virtues for collective moral agencies. I then consider how a better conception of collective moral agency and development of virtuous corporate character can improve conceptions of business obligation, especially as it relates to issues involving problematic institutional infrastructure. I argue that a virtue theoretic approach to corporate obligation is a useful supplement to most standard theories of business ethics. I then discuss ways in which the development of virtuous institutions may aid in coping with the moral problems that arise in a globalized economy especially with respect to absolute poverty and the environment. ...|$|E
