5|$|About 20 North Korean {{soldiers}} approached, undiscovered, {{close enough}} to the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, command post west of Haman to throw grenades and fire into it. About 45 soldiers of the battalion command group and 20 South Korean recruits were in position there at the time. The North Koreans were <b>driven</b> <b>off</b> at dawn, but Major Eugene J. Carson, battalion executive officer, then discovered that he had on the position with him only 30 men, 7 of them wounded. Looking back down the hill, Carson saw approximately 40 men get up out of the rice paddies and go over to a tank at a roadblock position. These men reported to the regiment that they had been <b>driven</b> <b>off</b> the hill. Three tanks near the command post helped clear the town of North Koreans.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{vehicles}} used in the film were rented, and therefore {{were not allowed to}} be damaged. Only two cars were damaged; one was <b>driven</b> <b>off</b> a bridge, although it was only intended to roll a short distance, and the Jeep filled with webbing needed $3,000 of repairs after solvent in the webbing damaged the interior.|$|E

5|$|That evening, D Company {{loaded into}} trucks {{traveled}} {{north to the}} assembly area through a heavy rain. On the way they met two truckloads of South Korean police going south, some of them wounded. These were the police who, together with the detachment of the I Platoon, had been <b>driven</b> <b>off</b> Ka-san that afternoon. After waiting in the rain awhile for orders, the Engineer company turned around {{and went back to}} camp.|$|E
5|$|The gibbet {{could be}} {{operated}} by cutting the rope supporting the blade or by {{pulling out the}} pin that held the rope. If the offender was to be executed for stealing an animal, a cord was fastened to the pin and tied to either the stolen animal {{or one of the}} same species, which was then <b>driven</b> <b>off,</b> withdrawing the pin and allowing the blade to drop.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} the raid was disputed. Collier claimed the action was {{successful}} in destroying military stores for an attack on Fort Cumberland (although such stores had not been delivered to Machias), while the defenders claimed that they had successfully prevented the capture of Machias and <b>driven</b> <b>off</b> the British.|$|E

5|$|Brody visits Kristin and Stacie as they {{pack the}} last of her {{belongings}} before leaving for the airport. After giving their final goodbyes, Brody sees Kristin's limousine off while it drives off her street. As Kristin looks out of the window, a montage of archived footage from the series' earlier seasons is shown. In the final scene of the series, with the camera on Brody, the Hollywood Hills backdrop is pulled away, while the camera pans back to reveal that the entire scene was filmed on a backlot. In reality, the vehicle had not <b>driven</b> <b>off</b> and Kristin stepped out of the vehicle to hug Jenner.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express {{was a special}} target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; some 16 employees were killed and approximately 150 express horses were either stolen or <b>driven</b> <b>off.</b> The Paiute war cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, {{not to mention the}} loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. government troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860.|$|E
5|$|Following Suleiman's {{unsuccessful}} Siege of Vienna in 1529, Ferdinand {{launched a}} counter-attack in 1530 {{to regain the}} initiative and avenge the destruction brought by Suleiman's 120,000 strong army. This campaign is usually considered as {{the start of the}} Little War, the period of a series conflicts between the Habsburgs and the Ottoman Empire. An assault of Buda was <b>driven</b> <b>off</b> by John Zápolya, the vassal King of Hungary, but Ferdinand was successful elsewhere, capturing Gran (Esztergom) and other forts along the Danube river, a vital strategic frontier.|$|E

5000|$|When {{used for}} many {{industrial}} processes, bituminous coal {{must first be}} [...] "coked" [...] to remove volatile components. Coking is achieved by heating the coal {{in the absence of}} oxygen, which <b>drives</b> <b>off</b> volatile hydrocarbons such as propane, benzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons, and some sulfur gases. This also <b>drives</b> <b>off</b> a considerable amount of the contained water of the bituminous coal.|$|R

5|$|In 1796, a large {{squadron}} of French frigates {{arrived in the}} Indian Ocean {{under the command of}} Contre-amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey. In July this force sailed on a commerce raiding cruise off British Ceylon, but a subsequent attack into the Straits of Malacca was <b>driven</b> <b>off</b> in an inconclusive engagement with two British ships of the line off Northeastern Sumatra. Forced to make repairs, Sercey took his squadron to the allied Batavian city of Batavia, sheltering there until January 1797.|$|E
5|$|In August 1988, {{production}} {{moved to}} the Florida Keys, notably Key West. Seven Mile Bridge towards Pigeon Key {{was used for the}} sequence in which the armoured truck transporting Sanchez, following his arrest, is <b>driven</b> <b>off</b> the edge. Other locations there included Ernest Hemingway House, Key West International Airport, Mallory Square, St. Mary's Star of the Sea Church for Leiter's wedding and Stephano's House 707 South Street for his house and patio. The US Coast Guard Pier was used to film Isthmus City harbour. As production moved back to Mexico, Broccoli became ill, leading to Michael G. Wilson becoming co-producer, a position he subsequently retained.|$|E

Rover, also sitting in the room, listens before jumping {{through the window and}} racing down the street, going around a corner and across a river. The dog makes its way to a slum and barges through each and every door; he finds the right one and enters. In an attic, the beggar woman is {{removing}} the clothing from the child; the dog enters and is <b>driven</b> <b>off</b> by the beggar.|$|E

5|$|Lhermitte then {{sailed to}} rejoin Sercey and the {{corvette}} Brûle-Gueule at Batavia in the Dutch East Indies for a planned junction with an allied Spanish squadron at Manila. This combined force then attacked an East India Company convoy {{gathering in the}} Pearl River in January 1799, but in the ensuing Macau Incident they were <b>driven</b> <b>off</b> by the Royal Navy escort squadron. Dispirited, Sercey returned westwards to Île de France, narrowly avoiding an unequal battle with a large British squadron blockading the port. On arrival he discovered that Preneuse and Brûle-Gueule were the only ships remaining of his original command, the others having returned to France or been lost in battle.|$|E
5|$|Maclean {{raised a}} force of about 180 Emigrants, {{and a number of}} militia. By the time he reached Sorel on October 14, he had raised, in {{addition}} to the Emigrants, about 400 militia men, sometimes using threatening tactics to gain recruits. His and Carleton's hopes were dashed on October 30, when Carleton's attempted landing at Longueuil of a force numbering about 1,000 (mostly militia, with some Emigrants and Indian support) was repulsed by the Americans. A few of his boats were landed, but most were <b>driven</b> <b>off</b> by Seth Warner's use of field artillery that had been captured at Chambly.|$|E
5|$|Mallards {{are also}} preyed upon by other {{waterside}} apex predators, {{such as the}} grey heron, European herring gull, the wels catfish, and the northern pike. Crows (Corvus) are also known to kill ducklings and adults on occasion. Also, mallards may be attacked by larger anseriformes such as swans (Cygnus) and geese during the breeding season, and are frequently <b>driven</b> <b>off</b> by these birds over territorial disputes. Mute swans (C. olor) {{have been known to}} attack or even kill mallards if they feel that the ducks pose a threat to their offspring.|$|E

5|$|Other Russian {{forces were}} more {{successful}} {{to the north}} of the town, where they managed to capture the village of Mokre from the 28th Regiment. The regiment counter-charged the village, but was initially <b>driven</b> <b>off.</b> However, approximately 80 pieces of emplaced Polish artillery laid a 30-minute barrage on the village. It was the greatest concentration of artillery fire in the war up to that point, and had a tremendous effect on the morale of the Russian defenders. After the barrage ended Lieutenant Colonel Wiktor Thommée personally led his forces in a bayonet charge; the regiment re-entered Mokre at noon and the Russians fled.|$|E
5|$|Reports of {{this first}} contact between {{opposing}} forces outside St. Jean were often wildly exaggerated, with many local reports claiming it {{as some kind of}} victory. The Quebec Gazette, for example, reported that 60 Indians had <b>driven</b> <b>off</b> 1,500 Americans, killing 30 and wounding 40. Following this news, General Carleton issued orders for all of the nearby parishes to call up ten percent of their militia. Officers of the militia reported to Montreal, but many militia men stayed home. By September 7, a troop of about 120 men was raised, which was sent to Fort St. Jean.|$|E
5|$|The 16th-century breech-loading model entered China around 1517 when Fernão Pires de Andrade {{arrived in}} China. However, {{he and the}} Portuguese embassy were {{rejected}} as problems in Ming-Portuguese relations were exacerbated when the Malacca Sultanate, a tributary state of the Ming, was invaded in 1511 by the Portuguese under Afonso de Albuquerque, {{and in the process}} a large established Chinese merchant community was slaughtered. The Malacca Sultanate sent the Ming a plea for help but no relief expedition was sent. In 1521 the Portuguese were <b>driven</b> <b>off</b> from China by the Ming navy in a conflict known as the Battle of Tunmen.|$|E
