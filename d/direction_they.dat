Sasha, still {{trying to find the}} three, gets confronted by BloodClan warriors, but is able to trick them into fear by telling them she is a Clan warrior out looking for revenge of Tigerstar's death, and the BloodClan cats end up pointing out the <b>direction</b> <b>they</b> saw the kits go.|$|E
5|$|Notts County's fate {{went in the}} {{opposite}} <b>direction.</b> <b>They</b> were relegated in bottom place the season after the 1996 play-off final defeat, only to win the 1997–98 Third Division title and gain instant promotion. However, they have spent every season since in the bottom two divisions. The two clubs did not meet again in league football until January 2008 after City's fall back down the league structure.|$|E

These antennas {{do not have}} focusing dishes and can transmit and receive from any <b>direction.</b> <b>They</b> are an important backup system to ensure that MRO can always be reached, even if its main antenna is pointed away from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Forrest's widow, Christine (Katharine Hepburn), {{refuses to}} speak to reporters {{throughout}} the proceedings. However, O'Malley befriends youngster Jeb (Darryl Hickman), son of the gatekeeper of the Forrest estate, Jason Rickards (Howard Da Silva). The grief-stricken boy shows him a way into the mansion, where he meets Christine. Though she is cordial enough, she refuses any cooperation with his biography. After O'Malley leaves, Forrest's private secretary, Clive Kerndon (Richard Whorf), fearful of how the reporter will react to the brushoff, convinces Christine to offer her help {{so that they can}} steer him in the <b>direction</b> <b>they</b> want.|$|E
5|$|Resonance was noticed {{early on}} in {{experiments}} with the Leyden jar, invented in 1746. The Leyden jar stores electricity due to its capacitance, and is, in fact, an early form of capacitor. When a Leyden jar is discharged by allowing a spark to jump between the electrodes, the discharge is oscillatory. This was not suspected until 1826, when Felix Savary in France, and later (1842) Joseph Henry in the US noted that a steel needle placed close to the discharge does not always magnetise in the same <b>direction.</b> <b>They</b> both independently drew the conclusion {{that there was a}} transient oscillation dying with time.|$|E

5|$|Stela 12 {{is located}} near Structure11. It is badly damaged, having been broken into {{fragment}}s, of which two remain. The largest fragment {{is from the}} lower portion of the stela and depicts the legs and feet of a figure, both facing in the same <b>direction.</b> <b>They</b> stand upon a panel divided into geometric sections, each containing a further design. In front of the legs are {{the remains of a}} glyph that appears to be a number in the bar-and-dot format. A smaller fragment lies nearby.|$|E
5|$|The Han-era Chinese {{noted the}} passage of the same comet seen in Persia for the birth of Mithridates II of Parthia in 135 BCE, the same comet the Romans {{observed}} close to the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BCE, Halley's comet in 12 BCE, the same comet noted by Roman historian Cassius Dio (c. 155– c. 229 CE) for 13 CE, and (what is now known to have been) a supernova in 185 CE. For various comets discussed in the Han-era history books Records of the Grand Historian and Book of Han, details are given for their position in the sky and <b>direction</b> <b>they</b> were moving, the length of time they were visible, their color, and their size.|$|E
5|$|To {{make the}} new game feel refreshing, only certain {{multiplayer}} elements were retained as the small team took {{the game in}} a different <b>direction.</b> <b>They</b> evaluated {{the core of the}} Rainbow Six series, which they thought was about being a member of a counter-terrorist team traveling around the globe to deal with dangerous terrorist attacks – operations which are usually intense confrontations between attackers and defenders. However, the team wanted to fit these ideas into a multiplayer format which would increase the game's sustainability. These became the basic concept ideas for the game. As the development team hoped that the game can be replayed frequently, the team decided to devote all the resources into developing the game's multiplayer and abandoned the single-player campaign.|$|E

5|$|Some animals, notably insects such as {{the honey}} bee, are {{sensitive}} to the polarisation of light. Honey bees can use polarized light on overcast days to estimate the position of the sun in the sky, relative to the compass <b>direction</b> <b>they</b> intend to travel. Karl von Frisch's work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from the hive to a food source (typically a patch of nectar-bearing flowers). A worker bee returns to the hive and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a waggle dance. The observing bees are then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction, though other biologists have questioned whether they necessarily do so, or are simply stimulated to go and search for food. However, bees are certainly able to remember the location of food, and to navigate back to it accurately, whether the weather is sunny (in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks) or largely overcast (when polarised light may be used).|$|E
5|$|The player {{starts the}} game with three lives. Several {{ingredients}} will fly around the screen simultaneously, and if the player touches an ingredient with their body, a life will be deducted. The player's objective {{is to put the}} ingredients into the cooking bowl before they either fall into the dustbins on either side or knock the player into the bowl. As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will push the ingredients further in the <b>direction</b> <b>they</b> are moving in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player to push the ingredients further than conventional flour sacks. The player has to push the right variety of ingredients into the bowl, which changes for each level. When the right amount of ingredients has been put in the bowl, a cake is baked and a new level begins.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} the Pindaris was carried out as planned. The Pindaris were attacked, and their homes were {{surrounded}} and destroyed. General Hislop from the Madras Residency attacked the Pindaris {{from the south and}} drove them beyond the Narmada river, where governor general Francis Rawdon-Hastings was waiting with his army. Karim Khan surrendered to the British and was given lands in Gorakhpur. The principal routes from Central India were occupied by British detachments. The Pindari forces were completely broken up, scattered {{in the course of a}} single campaign. They made no stand against the regular troops, and even in small bands they were unable to escape the ring of forces drawn around them. The Pindaris rapidly dispersed over the country. The Pindari chiefs were reduced to the condition of hunted outlaws. The desperate Pindaris expected the Marathas to help them, but none dared to give them even a place of shelter for their families. Karim and Setu had still 23,000 men between them but such a force was no match for the armies that surrounded them. In whatever <b>direction</b> <b>they</b> turned they were met by British forces. Defeat followed defeat. One gang made their escape to the south, leaving all their baggage behind them. Many fled to the jungles and perished. Others sought refuge in the villages, but were killed without mercy by the villagers who had not forgotten the sufferings they had been inflicted upon by the Pindaris. The Pindari chiefs Karim Khan and Wasil Mohammed had been present with their Durras at the battle of Mahidpur. Since by this time the Maratha powers had been reduced significantly, the pursuit of Setu and the other leaders was resumed with vigor. All the leaders had surrendered before the end of February and the Pindari system and power was brought to a close. They were removed to Gorakhptir where they obtained grants of land for their subsistence. Karim Khan became a farmer on the small estate he received beyond the Ganges in Gorakpur. Wasil Mohammed attempted to escape. He was found and committed suicide by taking poison. Setu, a Jat by caste, was hunted by John Malcolm from place to place until he had no followers left. He vanished into the jungles of Central India in 1819 and was killed by a tiger.|$|E

25|$|Players may {{point the}} bells of their {{instruments}} in the <b>direction</b> <b>they</b> are moving, or slide (also called traverse) with all the bells facing in the same <b>direction.</b> <b>They</b> may also point it towards {{the center of the}} field. Bands that march in time with the music typically also synchronize the direction of individuals' turns, and try to maintain even spacing between individuals in formations (called intervals). Sometimes bands specifically have wind players turn their instruments away from the audience to emphasize the dynamics of the music.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, JR's portrayer, actor Jacob Young, {{wanted to}} focus more on {{widening}} his acting range. This was coincidental to the writers turning JR in a different <b>direction.</b> <b>They</b> deepened the story by having JR act increasingly more like his father, when he was originally characterized by having several aspects of his mother's personality.|$|E
