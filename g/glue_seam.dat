40|$|The {{main object}} of this master´s thesis is to {{increase}} productivity glueing and lowering {{the weight of the}} bus roof while maintaining its toughness. The first part describes the present glueing technologies. Subsequently, there is adduced theoretically various hypothesis about the <b>glue</b> <b>seam.</b> The proposed solution is to use the glue containing accelerators. Two glues from the companies DINITROL and SIKA are suggested and compared. The following chapter details the suggested technology and describes its possibilities. The final part presents the project of ultralight roof made from sandwich panels...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the thesis were to investigate the adhesives influence on the mechanical properties in laminated multi-layer paperboard. The study also strived to find a method to investigate the interface strength of the adhesive layer. This was investigated by constructing handsheets of laminated paperboard by gluing a bulky, CTMP center ply, Chromofoil, of two different grammages, 290 g/m 2 and 360 g/m 2, together with two outer plies of ordinary copy paper, Multi- Copy 80 g/m 2. The sheets were glued with two types of dispersion adhesives, a starch based adhesive and a polyvinyl acetate based adhesive. Twelve types of test specimens were constructed and tested {{in a series of}} mechanical tests, which involved a tensile test, a two-point bending test and a Scott Bond test. The method called “digital image correlation” was used trying to investigate the interface strength of the adhesive layer. The study also involved an evaluation of the possibility to predict the bending stiffness of laminated multi-layer paperboard by using calculations according to classic laminate theory. The results show that it is fully possible to use these calculated values as a prediction, with low risk of overestimating the bending stiffness of the paperboard and without involving the adhesive layer in the calculation. The method provided high absolute values in bending and tensile properties, which increased with increasing amount of glue applied. This came at the cost of grammage, which lead to low index values. The overall conclusion is that the effect from the adhesives is somewhat negative, since the mechanical properties would have been improved if the adhesive had been replaced with more fiber. The major source of errors during the experiments was the roughness of the manufacturing method. This lead to an uncertainty about whether the right amount of adhesive had been applied to the test specimens. Due to this the validity of the results could be questioned. Digital image correlation proved to be a rather sensitive method that requires a high accuracy setup and execution for it to be applicable in this type of study. The failure mode of the <b>glue</b> <b>seam</b> correlated well to the amount of glue applied. A lower amount of adhesive applied increases the likeliness of failure of the <b>glue</b> <b>seam.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|A 1980 poll on {{conventional}} testing methods for {{the determination of}} the mechanical bond strength of <b>glued</b> box board <b>seams</b> resulted in a sad picture: eleven of the 25 questioned box board producers and converters qualify the <b>glued</b> <b>seam</b> subjectively by means of a fibretear test after manually splitting the adherends; the remaining 14 companies apply ten different procedures. This situation gave impact to the elaboration of a suggestion for an objective standard method suitable for quantitative measurements of the bond strength of set <b>glued</b> <b>seams</b> on folding boxes, which are ready to be delivered. For this purpose, the three most promising among the known procedures have been selected, and together with a fourth new developed method, tested for their applicability. As a primary criterion for the evaluation of the measured data, the resolution of the tested methods has been compared. The resolution has been studied as a function of parameters, which are relevant to the results, such asrate of loading, orientation of the seam axis, and loading direction. The novel procedure proved to be superior to the other tested methods...|$|R
50|$|During the Lapland War, six Myrskys flew 13 {{reconnaissance}} missions during November 1944. The wooden construction proved {{problematic in}} this theatre, not enduring wet weather or cold well. The war time Lukko glue, manufactured from ersatz materials, {{which was used}} for gluing the wooden parts, did not stand rain, frost and humidity, and the <b>glue</b> <b>seams</b> disintegrated, sometimes with disastrous results.|$|R
25|$|Manufacturing {{processes}} mainly {{depend on}} the material of the shell. Most suit shells are currently assembled by stitching the seams, which {{in the case of}} neoprene suits are first butt-glued, and are then overlock stitched and waterproofed by <b>glued</b> <b>seam</b> tape. DUI use a liquid polyurethane sealing compound over the seams {{on the inside of the}} suit instead of tape, and the rubber-coated Viking suits are dipped and heat cured for a seamless waterproof layer. DUI crushed neoprene suit shells are assembled before crushing the bubbles by hydrostatic pressure, then adding seals, zippers and accessories.|$|R

5000|$|LC 52 Chinese {{copies of}} American [...]30 Carbine ammo with forged Lake City (headstamp [...] "LC") markings. The {{ammunition}} was copper-washed steel-jacketed bullets with copper-washed steel cases. Some {{is found in}} brass cases, and is readily identifiable after firing, as these cases are still Berdan primed. (This makes it magnetic - so it may fail the BATF magnet test used to detect illegal semi-armor-piercing and armor-piercing steel-core penetrators). Unlike the USGI ammo, which has non-corrosive Boxer primers, it has corrosive Berdan primers. The cases have longitudinal scratches along the sides, like they have been reloaded. The bullet has a black sealant at its base and the primer has a clear pinkish-red sealant rather than an opaque red sealant. They come packed in 50-round cartons. Unlike US military ammunition, the boxes' seams are stapled and are crudely stamped 7.62mmLC in blue ink on the top rather than having <b>glued</b> <b>seams</b> and an arsenal label printed-on or glued-on the box. It {{is reported to have}} high pressures that are unsafe to use in an M1 carbine, especially a vintage one.|$|R

The [...] "classic" [...] colour for fetishistic latex {{clothing is}} black, but latex is naturally translucent {{and may be}} dyed any colour, including metallic shades or white. It can come in thicknesses which generally range from about 0.18 mm to 0.5 mm. Instead of being sewn, latex clothing is generally <b>glued</b> along its <b>seams.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many 1960s and 1970s wetsuits {{were black}} with visible yellow seam taping. The yellow made the divers more easily seen in dark low-visibility water. To avoid this problem O'Neill fabricators {{developed}} a seam-tape which combined a thin nylon layer with a polyester hemming tape. Applied over {{the interior of}} the <b>glued</b> & sewn <b>seam,</b> then anneal bonded with a hand held teflon heating iron produced a seam that was both securely sealed and much stronger.|$|R
50|$|Hide glue also {{functions}} {{as its own}} clamp. Once the glue begins to gel, it pulls the joint together. Violin makers may <b>glue</b> the center <b>seams</b> of top and back plates together using a rubbed joint rather than using clamps. This technique involves coating half of the joint with hot hide glue, and then rubbing the other half against the joint until the hide glue starts to gel, {{at which point the}} glue becomes tacky. At this point the plate is set aside without clamps, and the hide glue pulls the joint together as it hardens.|$|R
40|$|A low- speed wind-tunnel {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of canopy construction methods, design details, and canopy slots on the static longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of all-flexible parawings. Construction details such as type of nonporous canopy fabric, <b>glued</b> or sewed <b>seams,</b> tape reinforcement, or cloth-weave orientation had little effect on maximum lift-drag ratios and resultant-force coefficients. The maximum lift-drag ratios varied from 2. 2 to 2. 5 for the various single-keel unslotted parawings, and from 2. 2 to 2. 4 for the slotted canopy parawings. Incremental reductions in the lengths of all the suspension lines caused corresponding reductions in the resultantforce coefficients and maximum lift-drag ratios. The available range for modulation of resultant-force coefficient and lift-drag ratio by shortening the control lines was very limited. Includes bibliographical references (p. 18).

5000|$|Most wooden snare drum shells are {{constructed}} in plies (layers) that are heat- and compression-moulded into a cylinder. Steam-bent shells consist of one ply of wood that is gradually rounded into a cylinder and <b>glued</b> at one <b>seam.</b> Reinforcement rings, so-called [...] "re-rings", are often incorporated {{on the inside}} surface of the drum shell to keep it perfectly round. Segment shells are made of multiple stacks of segmented wood rings. The segments are glued together and rounded out by a lathe. Similarly, stave shells {{are constructed}} of vertically glued pieces of wood into a cylinder (much like a barrel) that is also rounded out by a lathe. Solid shells are constructed of one solid piece of hollowed wood.|$|R
50|$|The service {{behaviour}} {{is another}} aspect of great interest because it represents the overall material response to load conditions occurring during the entire life span of the structure. The result {{of this type of}} test represents a fundamental input data for the software used for structural analysis and the determination of the stress distribution in the structure.The biaxial behaviour at breaking load is an important open issue that has not been investigated thoroughly until now. Previous researches demonstrate the difficulties concerning the rupture of a biaxial sample, it has been noted that generally the maximum biaxial tensile strength is lower than the corresponding ultimate tensile strength obtained by means of a monoaxial test. However, the test can be focused on the resistance of a joint, evaluating the strength of welded (high frequency welding, hot element welding), <b>glued</b> and sewn <b>seams</b> or the resistance of clamping plates and Keder rail joints or looped and laced joints.|$|R
