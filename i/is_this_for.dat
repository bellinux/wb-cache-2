500|$|Libretto {{publications}} in Bach's Leipzig {{more than once}} grouped the first four cantatas after Trinity, or started a new publication with the cantata for the fifth occasion after Trinity. In 1724 that fifth occasion was Visitation, for which Bach composed [...] It is not a typical second cycle chorale cantata {{in the sense that}} it was based on a prose text (lacking the metre of a hymn text) and a Gregorian chant melody (lacking a musical metre). Further, the unmodified canticle text and chant melody not only appeared in the outer movements but also in one of the middle movements (the duet, No.5). The text of the final movement was a generic doxology which could be appended to any religious chant, while other chorale cantatas commonly ended with a text that only appeared in the hymn from which it was quoted. BWV 125, Bach's chorale cantata for Purification based on the Canticle of Simeon (Luke 2:29–32), does not have these exceptions to the second cycle format: it is based on Luther's versified paraphrase of the canticle and its metrical hymn melody. Nonetheless Dürr writes about BWV10 (here rendered in Richard D. P. Jones' translation): [...] "if ever a work deserved the description 'chorale cantata' it <b>is</b> <b>this,</b> <b>for</b> it is based on a genuine (Gregorian) chorale melody".|$|E
