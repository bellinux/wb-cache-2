It was found that the linen introduced into the washing machine had a high B. cereus spore content and that this was still present after the wash process. The spores were not killed by either the heat disinfection stage of the wash or the addition of chemical disinfectants and were not removed by the dilution in the process. The multiplication of B. cereus was thought to have occurred on used, damp linen stored in plastic bags, particularly when ambient temperatures were high.

Because of ubiquity in the environment, the recovery of Bacillus species from clinical specimens is often considered a clinically inconsequential contamination. Nevertheless, an accumulating body of literature suggests that contamination with this organism should not be routinely dismissed (1). Severe and lethal Bacillus cereus infections have been described in newborn infants, with higher frequency among premature infants.

40|$|Cost reduction, {{along with}} the {{satisfaction}} of patient's and other users' needs, {{is one of the}} major concerns of industries and organizations that provide health care services. Hospitals are complex organizations that deal with a wide range of materials. These materials require adequate and sometimes specific management approaches. The nature of their customers (patients and other users) asks for a rigorous control of these materials. One of these materials, hospitals' linen, requires a detailed control system. <b>Hospital's</b> <b>linen</b> is crucial for a good overall performance of any hospital. This material can be used, not only as a protection against diseases and infections, but also as a way of providing a more comfortable patient stay. It can even be essential to their recovery. Another crucial aspect is its use as an auxiliary in medical tasks. Clothing services are responsible for managing this type of materials. Consequently, they are required to manage them in an optimal manner in order, not only to reduce costs, but also to satisfy patients and all other hospital users. The experiment reported in this study was deigned with the objective of improving the management of this material. Consequently, it will enable the clothing service to provide services capable of meeting customers' needs and requirements. ...|$|R

40|$|Much {{remains to}} be elucidated about the {{epidemiology}} of nosocomial enterococcal infections. Enterococci are, however, known to be relatively thermotolerant, and several {{studies have shown that}} under laboratory conditions many strains are able to survive the time/temperature combinations of the UK Department of Health recommendations for the decontamination of used linen (HSG(95) 18). We therefore wished to investigate the efficacy of decontamination of enterococci from <b>hospital</b> <b>linen</b> in working hospital laundries. The thermotolerance of 40 strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium was first determined. Reduction by a factor of greater than 105 was achieved in only two of 40 strains after 3 min at 71 C or 10 min at 65 C, the time/temperature combinations specified by the Department of Health for the disinfection of used linen. During experimental challenge of 10 working hospital laundries, however, we demonstrated successful decontamination of laundry artificially contaminated with enterococci.

The hypothesis that uniforms/clothing could be a vehicle for the transmission of infections is not supported by existing evidence. All components of the laundering process contribute to the removal or killing of micro-organisms on fabric. There is no robust evidence of a difference in efficacy of decontamination of uniforms/clothing between industrial and domestic laundry processes, or that the home laundering of uniforms provides inadequate decontamination...|$|E

The study was conducted at the premises of Company A and it analyses the extent to which production of defective parts, overproduction, excessive inventory, unnecessary production steps, unnecessary movement of people, workers waiting for material and unnecessary handling of material affect the attainment of lean supply chain. Areas covered by the study are segments of the production department; namely the storeroom, cutting room, garment construction, cleaning and despatch. The study also looks at the attempts made and challenges encountered by Company A in eliminating these wastes. The effects of these wastes are visible throughout the company from sourcing of raw materials to the delivery of finished products. They affect delivery lead times, product/service quality, cost and customer satisfaction. These findings have implications on the competitiveness of Company A.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates {{one of the largest}} health care systems in the nation. For fiscal year 2007, VA estimates that it will provide health care to more than 5 million veterans, either in its own facilities or through other health care providers. During the past decade, the numbers of VA patients and the costs for treating them have increased rapidly, due in part to an expansion in the number of veterans eligible to receive care. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) [...] the VA entity responsible for the health care of veterans [...] spends about $ 35 billion a year providing health care to veterans, including more than $ 7 billion to acquire health care services and products. In its own health care facilities, VHA contracts for a broad range of medical services such as anesthesiology, for other services that support the delivery of medical care such as facility maintenance and laundry services, and for products such as medical equipment, food, and <b>hospital</b> <b>linens.</b> It also contracts for medical care for veterans provided in non-VA hospitals and community based clinics. Contracting for services at VHA represents a large and growing proportion of total contract spending. In an effort to improve the operation of VHA's health care system, VA's Inspector General (IG) conducted reviews of individual VHA facilities through structured site visits with teams of IG officials from fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2006. These teams included officials from three IG offices [...] Audit, Health Care Inspections, and Investigations. These reviews, known as the Combined Assessment Program (CAP), focused in part on actions to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of VHA's contracting. The IG issued a summary report in September 2006 on the results of these CAP reviews, including summaries of recommendations made to address systemic, recurring deficiencies in the planning, management, and oversight of service contracts. In addition the IG issued other reports in recent years on weaknesses in VHA health care contracting. Congress requested that GAO review the recommendations made by the VA IG to improve the award and administration of service contracts for veterans' health care, and VA's efforts to implement these recommendations. In this report GAO identifies (1) the recurring themes among the key recommendations from recent reports of the IG concerning VHA's award and administration of service contracts for veterans' health care, and (2) the current status of VHA's implementation of the recommendations, according to VA data. ...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to isolate, count and identify fungi and bacteria from different kinds of clean and dirty linen in a hospital. Microbiological samples have been collected on clean bed linen (n = 200), dirty bed linen (n = 192) and staff uniforms (n = 192) by using contact plates. 55 % of samples from clean bed linen were contaminated be-fore contact with the patient, with a mean count of 3 cfu/ 25 cm 2 (range: 1 - 117 cfu) when contaminated. Virtually all samples from dirty bed linen carried microorganisms, with a mean count of 23 cfu/ 25 cm 2 (range 1 - 191 cfu). In addi-tion, staff hospital uniforms showed the highest contamination rates in the study, with an average of 45 cfu/ 25 cm 2 (range: 1 - 218 cfu). Microbial species were mostly bacteria commonly found in the environment or on human skin, such as staphylococci or micrococci. Nevertheless, 57 % of the identified species may be opportunistic pathogens for hu-mans, representing a risk for people with a deficient or weakened immune system, especially in cases of superinfection. Since contamination of linen seems to occur after washing, actively antimicrobial textiles would represent a valuable measure to prevent textiles from being a vehicle for transfer of microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Hospital {{beds are}} {{potential}} reservoirs of bacteria in hospitals. Preventing {{contamination of the}} bed and providing a cleaner surface should help prevent hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). Most hospital beds are cleaned between patients (terminal cleaning) using quaternary ammonia compounds (quats). Objective The study had two objectives: identify levels of bacterial contamination on beds (including the mattress and bed deck) and evaluate a new launderable cover. Methods Hospital beds on a bariatric surgery ward were randomized to either receive or not receive a launderable cover (Trinity Guardion, Batesville, IN). Bacterial counts {{on the surface of the}} mattress, the bed deck, and the launderable cover were then collected using Petrifilm™ Aerobic Count Plates (Petrifilm™, 3 M™, St. Paul, MN, USA) (Petrifilm™) at three time periods (before patient use, after discharge, and after terminal cleaning). Standard <b>hospital</b> <b>linen</b> was used in all rooms. Results The launderable cover (n[*]=[*] 28) was significantly cleaner prior to patient use than were the cleaned mattresses (n[*]=[*] 38) (1. 1 [*]CFU/ 30 [*]cm 2 vs. 7. 7 [*]CFU/ 30 [*]cm 2; p[*]=[*] 0. 0189). The mattresses without launderable covers became significantly contaminated during use (7. 7 [*]CFU/ 30 [*]cm 2 on admission vs. 79. 1 [*]CFU/ 30 [*]cm 2 after discharge; p[*] 2 on admission vs. 2. 5 [*]CFU/ 30 [*]cm 2 at discharge; p[*]=[*] 0. 703). After terminal cleaning, the mattress surface contamination decreased to 12. 8 [*]CFU/ 30 [*]cm 2 (median 3 [*]CFU/ 30 [*]cm 2; SD 7. 8), but the bed deck was more contaminated (6. 7 [*]CFU/ 30 [*]cm 2 after discharge compared to 30. 9 [*]CFU/ 30 [*]cm 2 after terminal cleaning; p[*]=[*] 0. 031). Conclusions Terminal cleaning fails to eliminate bacteria from the surface of the hospital mattress. The launderable cover provides a cleaner surface than does terminal cleaning with quats, and the cover protects the bed from contamination during use. </p...|$|E

40|$|Acinetobacter baumannii is an {{important}} human pathogen that causes severe respiratory diseases in compromised patients. This bacterium {{is capable of surviving}} on nutrient-limited abiotic surfaces, such as bed <b>linens,</b> <b>hospital</b> equipment, and medical devices. This survival property suggested the possibility that this pathogen could form biofilms to survive such unfavorable conditions. Biofilms are aggregates of bacterial cells that are metabolically and physiologically distinct from their planktonic counterparts. Cells composing these structures work together to acquire nutrients and survive harsh environmental conditions. This hypothesis was proven by observing biofilm formation by A. baumannii on abiotic surfaces such as plastics. This formation seems to occur independently of cell motility, as we have been unable to detect such a capability in this organism. Random insertion mutagenesis revealed the presence of a chaperone-usher secretion system, which was found {{to be involved in the}} assembly of pili on the bacterial cell surface. These pili are essential for attachment and subsequent biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces, and are assembled using a cellular machinery similar to that described previously in other gram-negative pathogenic organisms.

The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate the bactericidal effects of fabrics coated with the hydroxyapatite-binding silver/titanium dioxide ceramic nanocomposite &quot;Earth-plus&quot;. Methods: Bactericidal activities of woven and nonwoven fabrics coated with Earth-plus were investigated by the time-kill curve method using nine bacterial strains, including three Staphylococcus aureus, three Escherichia coli, and three Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Results: The numbers of viable S. aureus and E. coli cells on both fabrics coated with Earth-plus decreased to below 2 log 10 colony-forming units/mL in six hours and reached the detection limit in 18 hours. Viable cell counts of P. aeruginosa on both fabrics coated with Earth-plus could not be detected after 3 &ndash; 6 hours. Viable cells on woven fabrics showed a more rapid decline than those on nonwoven fabrics. Bacterial cell counts of the nine strains on fabrics without Earth-plus failed to decrease even after 18 hours.
