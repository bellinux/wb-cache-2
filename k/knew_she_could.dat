500|$|... "The Edge of Glory" [...] was {{nominated}} {{in the category}} for Song of the Year at the 38th People's Choice Awards. At the end of 2011, Slant Magazine listed [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] as the eighth best song of the year, with Ed Gonzalez from the website commenting that the song is [...] "a study in radical contrast that, once you sift aside its deliberately dated effects {{and the legacy of}} the late Clarence Clemons, is deep down an incredibly delicate ballad. Yes, everyone expects Gaga to make her confessions on the dance floor, but who <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make her shouts whisper?" [...] It was placed at the same rank by Billboard, and at position seven by Rolling Stone. In September 2013, the saxophone solo ranked number two on VH1's list of the 15 Greatest Guest Solos in Rock History.|$|E
2500|$|Highly {{praised by}} all was Petula Clark, whom Ebert {{described}} as [...] "a surprise. I <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> sing, but I didn't expect much more. She is a fresh {{addition to the}} movies: a handsome profile, a bright personality, and a singing voice as unique {{in its own way}} as Streisand's." [...] In the Chicago Reader, David Kehr opined she [...] "had every right to a distinguished career in musicals." [...] John Mahoney of The Hollywood Reporter said she [...] "invites no comparisons, bringing to her interpretation of Sharon her own distinctive freshness and form of delivery." [...] In the New York Daily News, Wanda Hale cited her [...] "winsome charm which comes through despite a somewhat reactive role." [...] Joseph Morgenstern of Newsweek said she [...] "looks lovely" [...] and [...] "sings beautifully, with an occasional startling reference to the phrasing and timbre of Ella Logan's original performance." [...] Variety observed, [...] "Miss Clark gives a good performance and she sings the beautiful songs like a nightingale." [...] Clearly, in the United States at least, Clark was known only as a singer, although she had appeared as an actress in British films since she was a child.|$|E
60|$|How {{long that}} first sleep lasted, she never <b>knew.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> only remember, in the after-time, that she woke instantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you will}} not tell of me, dear friend, {{you will not}}. I never saw Lady Strickland like that; I did not <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be in such a rage." ...|$|R
60|$|Elfride {{had come}} back. What {{she had come}} to do he did not <b>know.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> only look on at his death, perhaps. Still, she had come back, and not deserted him utterly, and it was much.|$|R
60|$|If <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>know!</b> If <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>know</b> what {{he meant}} to do.|$|R
60|$|Her painful hesitancy brought Frona to a {{realization}} {{of her own}} thoughtlessness. But she had made the step, and she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not retrace it.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Cuthcott made a queer, deep little noise; {{it was not}} a laugh, however, and {{it seemed}} as if he <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not bear him to look at her just then.|$|E
6000|$|... "She can do anything; that's what I've {{always liked}} her for. I <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> play any part; but I {{understood}} that she played {{them one by}} one. I didn't understand that she would play two at the same time." ...|$|E
6000|$|As if in {{a painful}} dream, she waited suspended, unresolved. <b>She</b> did not <b>know,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not understand. Only {{she felt that}} all the threads of her fate were being held taut, in suspense. She only wept {{sometimes}} as she went about, saying blindly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not {{possible}} to-day, Mettie. I {{shall have}} much ado {{to get away}} to- morrow. Don't be so unhappy, you <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> come alone or with Edgar, if it were so very dreadful; or if you are so fierce, you had better go yourself and encounter [...] "Man Thomas."' ...|$|R
6000|$|Laverick drank {{his wine}} slowly. The woman knew! Impossible! Her eyes were {{watching}} his face, {{but he held}} himself bravely. What <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>know?</b> How <b>could</b> <b>she</b> guess? ...|$|R
6000|$|Slone had {{attacked}} Lucy in her one weak point. She felt a force rending her. She dared {{not look at}} Wildfire. Yes--all, that was true Slone had said. How desperately {{hard to think of}} forfeiting the great race she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> win! ...|$|E
60|$|She {{thought she}} had been forward, crimsoned in the dark, and retired into her shell {{for the rest of}} the evening. She was glad when with his usual tact, Mr. Belamour begged for the recitation he <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make with the least effort of memory.|$|E
60|$|The {{straightforward}} course had, nevertheless, so much {{to recommend}} it, so well avoided the disadvantage of future revelation which a private repetition of the ceremony would entail, that assuming she could depend upon Swithin, as she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do, good sense counselled its serious consideration.|$|E
60|$|Life {{and hope}} were ash in her mouth. She shuddered with discord. Despair grated between her teeth. This dreariness {{was worse than}} any her dreary, lonely life had <b>known.</b> <b>She</b> felt <b>she</b> <b>could</b> bear it no longer.|$|R
60|$|He cursed {{himself for}} {{being such a}} brute, such a beast as to let her stand there, tiring herself to death. She must never do it again. He was a devil. He ought to have <b>known</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not stand it. He was not fit to be married. He was not fit to live.|$|R
60|$|But Jeanne did not <b>know.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not tell. Her nerves {{now were}} {{somewhat}} unstrung, {{and the tears}} that always came so readily to her eyes flowed quite unchecked. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not very well move, for he held her knees imprisoned in his arms, but she was quite content to remain like this, and to yield her hands to him {{so that he might}} cover them with kisses.|$|R
60|$|He {{moved about}} {{the room with a}} certain sureness of touch, swift and {{relentless}} and quiet. She <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not cope with him. He would escape like a weasel out of her hands. Yet without him her life would trail on lifeless. Brooding, she touched the flowers.|$|E
60|$|The DAY DREAM had set sail, and Marguerite Blakeney {{stood alone}} {{on the edge of}} the cliff over an hour, {{watching}} those white sails, which bore so swiftly away from her the only being who really cared for her, whom she dared to love, whom she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> trust.|$|E
60|$|She stood helplessly {{stranded}} on his world. He continued his work. She <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not help him. A little bit forlorn, {{at last she}} turned away, {{and ran down the}} garden, away from him, as fast as she could go away from him, to forget him and his work.|$|E
5000|$|Isotope {{analysis}} indicated that the Beachy Head Lady grew up in southeast England. Jo Seaman said the results were intriguing: [...] "Whether that means that she's first generation we don't <b>know.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> possibly have been born in Africa and brought over here {{at a very young}} age, but it's just as likely that she was born here." ...|$|R
60|$|The servant who {{answered}} her knock did not <b>know</b> whether <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see Mr. Eden, and summoned her mistress.|$|R
6000|$|That smile {{made up to}} Carley for all the clamoring {{sensations of}} stiff, sore muscles. It made her ashamed that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not fling herself into this {{adventure}} with all her heart. Carley essayed to sit up. [...] "Oh, I'm afraid my anatomy has become disconnected!... Glenn, do I look a sight?" [...] She never would have asked him that if <b>she</b> had not <b>known</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> bear inspection at such an inopportune moment.|$|R
60|$|The {{beautiful}} {{lady with}} the silvery hair sat and gazed on him admiringly. She <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> trust him; {{she knew he}} would keep it in. But she knew at the same time how desperate a struggle the effort cost him; and visionary though he was, she loved and admired him for it.|$|E
60|$|She {{wished for}} some {{one to go}} to for advice. Mrs. Thayer, she knew, would exclaim in horror over the matter. The Major had hinted the course {{she would have to}} take, which was to show Arthur he had no {{connection}} with her life--if she could. But deep in her heart she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not do that.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's not {{to blame}} because her mother drinks, and her father's a shyster," [...] said Ruth earnestly and strongly. [...] "The men who make her the laughing-stock of the Ferry tried to make her {{something}} worse, and failed, and take this sneak's revenge on her. 'Laughing-stock!' Yes, they <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> turn the tables on them." ...|$|E
50|$|During her {{interviews}} with the victim, {{it became clear to}} Byron that the victim did not completely understand what had happened to her, so she would not have <b>known</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say no. During the investigation, {{it became clear that the}} victim still wanted the athletes to like her, and that she did not want to get them in trouble.|$|R
60|$|Grace colored. Although she did {{not like}} Hayes, he was Osborn's agent. There was much <b>she</b> wanted to <b>know,</b> but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not ask.|$|R
6000|$|... "I presume she had sense {{enough to}} <b>know</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{not afford to}} choose," [...] said Alice, complacently. [...] "She is very ugly." ...|$|R
60|$|But Mrs. Clifford sat on, on {{the sofa}} where Elma left her, and cried to herself silently, silently, silently. What a mother should do in these hateful {{circumstances}} she could hardly even guess. She only <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never speak it out, and even if she did, Elma would never have the courage or the heart to listen to her.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Stelling {{liked her}} prattle immensely, {{and they were}} on the best of terms. She told Tom she should like to go to school to Mr. Stelling, as he did, and learn just the same things. She <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do Euclid, for she had looked into it again, and she saw what ABC meant--they were the names of the lines.|$|E
6000|$|... "How thoughtless {{people are}} {{to put things}} where a hungry mouse cannot get at them," [...] said Mamma Mouse to herself, with a sigh. But just then she espied a barrel of flour {{standing}} upon the floor; and that gave her new courage, for she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> easily gnaw through that, and the flour would do to eat {{just as well as}} the bread.|$|E
6000|$|Lady Carbury {{was again}} in tears. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{not hope to}} get a word of truth from her son. 'What {{do you mean by}} a large sum?' ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{the only}} tune <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> but that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> play with one finger.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't <b>know</b> how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do it, or why {{she cared}} {{for such a}} miserable scamp, {{breaking}} her heart all this time!' he exclaimed.|$|R
