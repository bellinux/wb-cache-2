40|$|Abstract. A {{sequential}} <b>linear</b> <b>estimator</b> {{is developed}} {{in this study}} to progressively incorporate new or different spatial data sets into the estimation. It begins with a <b>classical</b> <b>linear</b> <b>estimator</b> (i. e., kriging or cokriging) to estimate means conditioned to a given observed data set. When an additional data set becomes available, the sequential estimator improves the previous estimate by using linearly weighted sums of differences between the new data set and previous estimates at sample locations. Like the <b>classical</b> <b>linear</b> <b>estimator,</b> the weights used in the sequential <b>linear</b> <b>estimator</b> are derived from a system of equations that contains covariances and cross-covariances between sample locations and the location where the estimate is to be made. However, the covariances and crosscovariances are conditioned upon the previous data sets. The sequential estimator is shown to produce the best, unbiased linear estimate, and to provide the same estimates and variances as classic simple kriging or cokriging with the simultaneous use of the entire data set. However, by using data sets sequentially, this new algorithm alleviates numerical difÂ®culties associated with the classical kriging or cokriging techniques when {{a large amount of}} data are used. It also provides a new way to incorporate additional information into a previous estimation. Key words: Sequential <b>linear</b> <b>estimator,</b> successive <b>linear</b> <b>estimator,</b> conditional covariance, interpolation with large data sets. ...|$|R

Using properties of exponential family distributions and <b>generalizing</b> <b>classical</b> <b>linear</b> statistics techniques, a unified theoretical model called Generalized Linear Statistics (GLS) is established.

The introduction of kernel method from machine learning community has {{a great impact on}} statistical analysis. The kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) is a method that <b>generalizes</b> the <b>classical</b> <b>linear</b> canonical correlation analysis to nonlinear setting.

The main {{purpose of this article is}} twofold. One is to link the KCCA emerging from the machine learning community to the nonlinear canonical analysis in statistical literature, and the other is to provide the KCCA some further statistical applications including association measures, dimension reduction and test of independence without the usual Gaussian assumption.
