50|$|A {{tailless}} aircraft (often tail-less) traditionally has all its horizontal control surfaces on its main wing surface. It has no horizontal stabiliser - either tailplane or canard foreplane (nor {{does it have}} a second wing in tandem arrangement). A 'tailless' type usually still has a <b>vertical</b> stabilising <b>fin</b> (<b>vertical</b> stabiliser) and control surface (rudder). However, NASA adopted the 'tailless' description for the novel X-36 research aircraft which has a canard foreplane but no <b>vertical</b> <b>fin.</b>|$|R

This paper centers on improving {{the level of the}} <b>vertical</b> <b>planning</b> of complex pipeline, and identifying the reasonable design sequence of complex pipeline on the Blin method which using the principle of fuzzy mathematics. According to the existing method of vertical pipeline design, a model of vertical crossing of various single pipelines in urban intersection is established. Meanwhile, a new method of the <b>vertical</b> <b>planning</b> and design of complex pipeline is put forward. A case design of complex pipeline is carried out with this method to verify the feasibility as well as the effectiveness of it, hoping to provide design ideas for majors in the <b>vertical</b> <b>planning</b> and design of complex pipeline...|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of junctionless multigate transistor (JMT) with <b>fin</b> <b>vertical</b> nonuniformity are investigated using three-dimensional simulation {{for the first}} time. The {{results show that the}} electrical characteristics, such as on-state current (Ion), subthreshold swing (SS) and drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) effect, are affected by the sidewall angle (θ). The more superior SS and DIBL features also with smaller fluctuations have been observed in JMTs as compared with inversion-mode multigate MOSFETs (IM-MuGFETs). Hence, JMT is beneficial to suppress the short channel effects in the scaled devices. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} natural {{convection}} heat transfer from fin arrays with inclination is studied experimentally and theoretically {{to find the}} effect of inclination of {{the base of the}} fin array on heat transfer rate. A numerical model is developed by taking an enclosure, which is formed by two adjacent <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> and horizontal base. Results obtained from this enclosure are used to predict heat transfer rate from the fin array. All the governing equations related to fluid in the enclosure, together with the heat conduction equation in both the fins are solved by using Alternate Direct Implicit method. Numerical results are obtained for temperature {{along the length of the}} fin and in the fluid in the enclosure. The experimental studies have been also carried out on two geometric orientations viz., (a) vertical base with <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> (<b>vertical</b> <b>fin</b> array) and (b) horizontal base with <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> (horizontal fin array), with the five different inclinations like 00, 300, 450, 600, and 900.

40|$|Based {{on current}} projections, III-Vs are {{expected}} to replace Si as the n-channel solution in FinFETs at the 7 nm technology node. The realisation of III-V FinFETs entails top-down fabrication via dry etch techniques. <b>Vertical</b> <b>fins</b> in conjunction with high quality sidewall MOS interfaces are required for high-performance logic devices. This, however, is difficult to achieve with dry etching. Highly anisotropic etching required of <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> is concomitant with increased damage to the sidewalls, resulting {{in the quality of}} the sidewall MOS interface being compromised. In this work, we address this challenge in two stages by first undertaking a systematic investigation of dry etch processing for fin formation, with the aim of obtaining high resolution <b>fins</b> with <b>vertical</b> sidewalls and clean etch surfaces. In the second stage, dry etch process optimisation and post-etch sidewall passivation schemes are explored to mitigate the damage arising from anisotropic etching required for the realisation of <b>vertical</b> <b>fins...</b>|$|R
50|$|On August 12, 1985, Japan Air Lines Flight 123, a Boeing 747-SR100, {{experienced}} {{cabin decompression}} 12 minutes after takeoff from Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan, at 24,000 feet. The decompression {{was caused by}} failure of a previously repaired aft pressure bulkhead. Cabin air rushed into the unpressurized fuselage cavity, overpressurizing the area and causing failure of the auxiliary power unit (APU) firewall and the supporting structure for the <b>vertical</b> <b>fin.</b> The <b>vertical</b> <b>fin</b> separated from the airplane. Hydraulic components located in the aft body were also severed, leading to a rapid depletion of all four hydraulic systems. The loss of the <b>vertical</b> <b>fin,</b> coupled {{with the loss of}} all four hydraulic systems, left the airplane extremely difficult, if not impossible, to control in all three axes. Lack of independence of four hydraulic systems from a single failure event was a zonal hazard.

40|$|The {{gate oxide}} {{reliability}} and the electrical behavior of FinFETs {{are directly related}} to the surface characteristics of the <b>fin</b> <b>vertical</b> sidewalls. The surface roughness of the fin sidewalls {{is one of the most}} important structural parameters to be monitored in order to optimize the fin patterning and postetch treatments. Because of the nanometer-scale dimensions of the <b>fins</b> and the <b>vertical</b> orientation of the sidewall surface, their roughness measurement is a serious challenge. In this paper, we describe a simple and effective method for measuring the sidewall morphology of silicon fins by conventional atomic force microscopy. The present methodology has been employed to analyze fins as etched by reactive ion etching and fins repaired by sacrificial oxidation. The results show that sacrificial oxidation not only reduces the roughness of the sidewalls, but also rounds the top corners of silicon fins. The present method can also be applied to characterize sidewall roughness of other nanostructures and materials such as the polysilicon gate of transistors or nanoelectromechanical beams...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the steady-state rates of heat transfer from an array of <b>vertical</b> rectangular <b>fins</b> of 3 mm thickness and 250 mm length, protruding 60 mm perpendicularly upwards from a 250 mm x 190 mm horizontal rectangular base, is reported. For constant (to Â± 0 Â· 1 Â°C) base temperatures between 40 Â°C and 80 Â°C, in an ambient environment of 20 Â± 0 Â· 2 Â°C, the optimal separation of the parallel fins, corresponding to the maximum rate of heat loss, is 10 Â· 5 Â± 1 Â· 0 mm. The effects {{of the extent of}} the fin protrusions on the thermal performances of such <b>vertical</b> <b>fins,</b> on the same base, which was arranged to be either vertical or horizontal, have been studied. The experiments were performed with three different fin protrusions, namely 32 mm, 60 mm and 90 mm, for a base temperature of 40 Â°C above that of the ambient environment. The steady-state rate of heat dissipation from the fin array increased slightly less than linearly with the fin protrusion for both orientations, but the relationship became closer to linear as the fin spacing was increased. A comparison of the abilities to dissipate heat to the room air from the same geometrical configuration having a rectangular fin array but positioned with <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> on a <b>vertical</b> base, <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> protruding upwards from a horizontal base, or horizontal <b>fins</b> on a <b>vertical</b> base, has been made.
