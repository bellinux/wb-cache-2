5|$|In April–May 1970, Fischer won at Rovinj/Zagreb with 13/17 (+10−1=6), by a {{two-point}} margin, {{ahead of}} Gligorić, Hort, Korchnoi, Smyslov, and Petrosian. In July–August, Fischer crushed the mostly grandmaster field at Buenos Aires, winning by a 3½-point margin, scoring 15/17 (+13−0=4). Fischer then played first {{board for the}} U.S. Team in the 19th Chess Olympiad in Siegen, where he won an individual Silver medal, scoring 10/13 (+8−1=4), with his only loss being to World Champion Boris Spassky. Right after the Olympiad, Fischer defeated Ulf Andersson in an exhibition game for the Swedish newspaper Expressen. Fischer <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> game to a new level.|$|E
5|$|Onassis <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> first flying {{lesson in}} 1967 and had accrued 1,500 flying hours {{by the time}} of his death. Possessing a {{professional}} pilot's license, he was appointed the President of Olympic Aviation, a regional Greek subsidiary of his father's Olympic Airways, in 1971. Onassis' poor eyesight meant that he could not hold an air transport license, but could possess an air commercial license, allowing him to fly light planes and air taxis for emergency medical cases.|$|E
5|$|Rabodo {{agreed to}} these conditions. The next morning, it was {{publicly}} {{announced in the}} marketplace that Radama <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> own life due to grief over the deaths of his compatriots the menamaso and that Rabodo would succeed him as Queen Rasoherina. To cement the new power-sharing agreement between the ruler, the nobles and {{the heads of the}} people, a political marriage was contracted between the queen and Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony, who had been instrumental in her first husband's death. Radama's name was struck from the list of kings and it was declared illegal to mourn his death.|$|E

5|$|A {{narrative}} pattern follows, whereby Cet {{demands a}} challenge, an Ulster warrior rises, and the Ulaid cry out {{the name of}} the challenger; Cet then proceeds to shame that warrior by recounting one of his deeds against him, as above. Cet shames the challenger Óengus son of Lam Gabuid, by recounting how he had cut off Lam Gabuid's hands in battle; he shames Éogan son of Durthacht, the king of Fermag, by recounting how he put out his eye in a cattle-raid; he reminds Muinremur son of Gerrgend how he <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> son's head as a trophy not six days earlier; Mend son of Salchad, how he had cut off his father's foot; Celtchair son of Uthecar, how he had castrated him with his spear; and even Conchobar's son Cúscraid Mend Machae, how he had pierced his neck with a spear during Cúscraid's first feat of arms, in ignominious circumstances which led to the abandonment a third of Cúscraid's retinue in a cowardly retreat. In each case, the challenging warriors are compelled to retake their seats in shame.|$|E
5|$|General William Howe <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> army from New York City by sea on a {{campaign}} to capture Philadelphia instead of moving north to meet Burgoyne. Most of Burgoyne's Indian support had fled following the loss at Bennington, and his situation was becoming difficult. He needed to reach defensible winter quarters, requiring either retreat back to Ticonderoga or advance to Albany, {{and he decided to}} advance. He then deliberately cut communications to the north so that he would not need to maintain a chain of heavily fortified outposts between his position and Ticonderoga, and he decided to cross the Hudson River while he was in a relatively strong position. He ordered Baron Riedesel, who commanded the rear of the army, to abandon outposts from Skenesboro south, and then had the army cross the Hudson just north of Saratoga between September 13 and 15.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October 1469, Henry Percy <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> oath of fealty to the King, and {{had been}} {{released}} from the Tower. The following year saw the return of Robin of Redesdale and another rebellion on behalf of Warwick. Montagu was forced to {{come down from the}} Scottish border to suppress it; this he did, but, one historian has suggested, albeit that he 'allowed the leaders to escape... ensuring that the rebellion could rise again' at a more opportune moment. Almost immediately, Montagu was forced to crush another rebellion, this time lead by a Robin of Holderness, but calling for the return of Percy to the Northumberland Earldom. The Redesdale rebels soon reformed into an army big enough to march south and defeat a royal force at the Battle of Edgecote Moor on 26 July 1469. King Edward still accepted that Montagu was uninvolved in his brother's rebellion, and in the event, Montagu was the only Neville to accompany the king on his journey from the north back to London.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the forest was visited by {{mountain}} men and explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger. Colter {{is the first}} white man known to have visited both the Yellowstone region and the forest, which he did between 1807 and 1808. Having been an original member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Colter requested permission from Meriwether Lewis to leave the expedition after it had finished crossing the Rocky Mountains during their return journey from the Pacific Ocean. Colter teamed up with two unaffiliated explorers the expedition had encountered, but soon thereafter decided to explore regions south of where his new partners wished to venture. Traveling first into the northeastern region of what is today Yellowstone National Park, Colter then explored the Absaroka Mountains, crossing over Togwotee Pass and entering the valley known today as Jackson Hole. Colter survived a grizzly bear attack and a pursuit by a band of Blackfeet Indians who <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> horse. The explorer later provided William Clark, who had been his commander on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, with previously unknown information on the regions he had explored, which Clark published in 1814.|$|E

25|$|Zeshin {{was born}} and raised in Edo (modern-day Tokyo). His {{grandfather}} Izumi Chobei and his father Ichigoro were shrine carpenters (miyadaiku) and skilled wood carvers. His father, who <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> wife's family name of Shibata, was also an experienced ukiyo-e painter, having studied under Katsukawa Shunshō. This, of course, gave him an excellent start on the road to being an artist and craftsman. At age eleven, Kametaro, as Zeshin was called in his childhood, became apprenticed to a lacquerer named Koma Kansai II.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} {{just how}} those men looked as we rode up the little hill where their camp was. The red {{light of the}} morning sun was streaming upon them as they lay head towards us on the ground. And every man had a round red spot {{on top of his}} head, about as big as a dollar where the redskins <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> scalp. It was frightful, but it was grotesque, and the red sunlight seemed to paint everything all over. I remember one man had on buckskin breeches.|$|E

25|$|Eight years later, in 1849, the {{cemetery}} got its first large monument. Joseph Ellicott, a resident who as {{agent for the}} Holland Land Company had overseen and planned the settlement {{of what is now}} Western New York, <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> own life in New York City in 1826 and was buried there. Almost a quarter-century after his death his sister Rachel Evans arranged for his body to be reburied in the city he had founded, with a large monument inscribed with an account of his life and work. More land was added to {{the cemetery}} three years later, in 1852.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} setbacks triggered another {{change in}} the Byzantine government. In the spring of 919, the admiral Romanos Lekapenos forced Zoe Karbonopsina back into a monastery and quickly rose to prominence. In April 919 his daughter Helena Lekapene married ConstantineVII, and Lekapenos assumed the title basileopator; in September he was named Caesar, and in December 919 was crowned senior emperor. This new development infuriated Simeon; he considered Romanos a usurper and felt insulted that a son of an Armenian peasant <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> own promised position. The Bulgarian emperor rebuffed offers to become related with Romanos through a dynastic marriage and refused to negotiate for peace until he stepped down.|$|E
25|$|Petar Kočić {{was born}} into a Bosnian Serb family in the hamlet of Stričići, in the Zmijanje region near Banja Luka, {{northern}} Bosnia, on 29 June 1877. His father, Jovan, was an Eastern Orthodox priest and his mother, Mara, was a housewife. Within a year of his birth, the Bosnia Vilayet was occupied by Austria-Hungary, bringing more than four centuries of Ottoman rule to a sudden end. Kočić's father <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> priestly vows in 1873. In 1879, Kočić's mother died while giving birth to his younger brother Ilija, and his father decided to become a monk at the Gomionica Monastery, where he adopted the monastic name Gerasim.|$|E
