25|$|In January 2010, the President of the Federated States of Micronesia, Emanuel Mori, and the President of the Republic of Nauru, Marcus Stephen, {{with their}} foreign ministers, visited Israel to expand ties {{on issues such}} as healthcare, solar energy, water conservation, clean {{technologies}} and other areas in which Israel can provide expertise.

25|$|Jordan and Egypt were {{appointed}} by the Arab League as its representatives to meet with <b>Israeli</b> <b>leaders</b> to promote the Initiative. These countries were chosen because Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab countries that have diplomatic relations with Israel. Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul Ilah Khatib and Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit met with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, and Defense Minister Ehud Barak in Jerusalem on July 25, 2007, {{which was the first}} time that Israel received an official delegation from the Arab League.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before the}} signing of the Israel-Jordan {{armistice}} agreement, general Yigal Allon proposed to conquer the West Bank up to the Jordan River as the natural, defensible border of the state. Ben-Gurion refused, although he was aware that the IDF was militarily strong enough to carry out the conquest. He feared the reaction of Western powers and wanted to maintain good relations with the United States and not to provoke the British. More, the results of the war were already satisfactory and <b>Israeli</b> <b>leaders</b> had to build a nation.|$|E
25|$|In various {{speeches and}} articles, Swamy has {{expressed}} his admiration for, and solidarity with, the State of Israel and has credited its retaliatory capacity {{for its ability}} to survive as a nation in a hostile Arab environment. Swamy made pioneering efforts towards India's establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel. In 1982, Swamy became the first Indian political leader to make a well-publicised trip to Israel, where he met with several important <b>Israeli</b> <b>leaders</b> such as Yitzhak Rabin and then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin. His efforts at normalising relations with Israel have borne fruit with both India as well as Israels decision, in 1992, to facilitate the building of embassies in their respective countries.|$|E

25|$|Lehi leaders {{initially}} denied {{responsibility for}} the attack. Later Lehi took {{responsibility for the}} killings {{in the name of}} Hazit Hamoledet (the National Front), a name they copied from a war-time Bulgarian resistance group. The group regarded Bernadotte as a stooge of the British and their Arab allies, and therefore as a serious threat to the emerging state of Israel. Most immediately, a truce was in force and Lehi feared that the Israeli leadership would agree to Bernadotte's peace proposals, which they considered disastrous. They did not know that the <b>Israeli</b> <b>leaders</b> had already decided to reject Bernadotte's plans and take the military option. Betty Knut-Lazarus, a Lehi militant, and the granddaughter of composer Alexander Scriabin, was also imprisoned for being allegedly involved in the killing, before being subsequently released.|$|E
25|$|In June 2012, Israeli State Comptroller Micha Lindenstrauss {{released}} {{a report on the}} decision-making process leading to the flotilla raid. It found major fault with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision-making process over the events, stating that he failed to organize an orderly and coordinated discussion with other <b>Israeli</b> <b>leaders,</b> instead consulting Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman in undocumented meetings. Netanyahu was also criticized for his failure to call a cabinet meeting to discuss the matter, despite the requests of Defense Minister Ehud Barak, IDF Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi, and Strategic Affairs Minister Moshe Yaalon. He instead consulted the forum of seven, a group of seven cabinet ministers with no constitutional basis, once before leaving to visit North America. The meeting took place five days before the raid, and relevant officials, including the Justice and Internal Security Ministers, were not invited, and the discussion was not in line with national security-related decision-making protocols. The report also found fault with Netanyahu failing to hold a discussion with the defense and foreign ministers to start a dialogue that could result in a diplomatic and political effort to prevent the flotilla from leaving or prevent it from getting as far as it did.|$|E
500|$|Some Republican leaders criticized Emanuel's {{appointment}} {{because they}} believed it went against Obama's campaign promises of less divisive politics, given Emanuel's reputation as a partisan Democrat. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham disagreed, saying: [...] "This is a wise choice by President-elect Obama. He's tough but fair, honest, direct and candid." [...] Ira Forman, {{executive director of the}} National Jewish Democratic Council, said that the choice indicated that Obama would not listen to the [...] "wrong people" [...] regarding the U.S.–Israel relationship. Some commentators opined that Emanuel {{would be good for the}} Israeli–Palestinian peace process because if <b>Israeli</b> <b>leaders</b> made excuses for not dismantling settlements, Emanuel would be tough and pressure the Israelis to comply.

2500|$|Netanyahu had {{previously}} called U.S.-backed peace talks {{a waste of}} time, {{while at the same}} time refusing to commit to the same two-state solution as had other <b>Israeli</b> <b>leaders,</b> until a speech in June 2009. He repeatedly made public statements which advocated an [...] "economic peace" [...] approach, meaning an approach based on economic cooperation and joint effort rather than continuous contention over political and diplomatic issues. This is in line with many significant ideas from the Peace Valley plan. He raised these ideas during discussions with former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Netanyahu continued to advocate these ideas as the Israeli elections approached. Netanyahu has said: ...|$|E
2500|$|Some critics {{believe that}} Israel is {{only trying to}} [...] "put on a show," [...] {{claiming}} the Israelis do not seek a peace agreement, but are using these peace talks to further other goals, including improving their image, strengthening their occupation of the West Bank, and decreasing the viability of Palestine as a state free of Israeli occupation. Henry Siegman faults the United States, arguing that it is 'widely seen as the leading obstacle for peace' for its repeated failure to use leverage against Israel, and for failing to impose red lines for an agreement, and leading <b>Israeli</b> <b>leaders</b> to believe no consequences would ensue were Israel to reject American proposals.|$|E
2500|$|Israel and Pakistan do {{not have}} {{diplomatic}} relations with each other, and Pakistan passports say 'This passport is valid for all countries of the World except Israel'.

Some <b>Israeli</b> <b>leaders</b> have expressed the belief that should diplomatic relations with Pakistan be established, then Pakistan could serve as a bridge between Israel and the Muslim world.

He views the other peoples of the Middle East as Israel's most natural allies and claims that Israel trying to attach itself to Western powers and present itself as a Western country is actually the largest barrier to peace. He has consistently rejected reducing the definition of peace to an absence of conflict and insists that real peace requires a situation of [...] "Semitic Unity" [...] in which Israel exists as an organic part of the region.|$|E
