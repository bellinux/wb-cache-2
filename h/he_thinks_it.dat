Drawing a parallel with preventive medicine, <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> should promote the protection of open space and ecosystems before the downward spiral to extinction begins.|$|E
25|$|The Concord (Mass.) Public Library {{committee}} {{has decided to}} exclude Mark Twain's latest book from the library. One {{member of the committee}} says that, while he does not wish to call it immoral, <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> contains but little humor, and that of a very coarse type. He regards it as the veriest trash. The library and {{the other members of the}} committee entertain similar views, characterizing it as rough, coarse, and inelegant, dealing with a series of experiences not elevating, the whole book being more suited to the slums than to intelligent, respectable people.|$|E

25|$|<b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> ill-advised {{to build}} the doctrines of natural {{religion}} and morality on a hypothesis which many philosophers had rejected, and {{which could not be}} proved against Epicureans, the principal impugners of the existence of laws of nature. He cannot assume, he says, that such ideas existed from eternity in the divine mind, but must start from the data of sense and experience, and thence by search into the nature of things to discover their laws. It is only through nature that we can rise to nature's God. His attributes are not to be known by direct intuition. He, therefore, held that the ground taken up by the Cambridge Platonists could not be maintained against Hobbes.|$|E
25|$|Marcus Sikosek (now Ziko van Dijk) has {{challenged}} this figure of 1.6 million as exaggerated. He estimated {{that even if}} Esperanto speakers were evenly distributed, assuming one million Esperanto speakers worldwide would lead one to expect about 180 {{in the city of}} Cologne. Van Dijk finds only 30 fluent speakers in that city, and similarly smaller-than-expected figures in several other places thought to have a larger-than-average concentration of Esperanto speakers. He also notes that there are a total of about 20,000 members of the various Esperanto organizations (other estimates are higher). Though there are undoubtedly many Esperanto speakers who are not members of any Esperanto organization, <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> unlikely that there are fifty times more speakers than organization members.|$|E

It just so happens that Xi'er is now in the temple too, and by the light of a flash of lightning, the landlord sees her—with her long white hair and shabby clothes that have been weathered to nearly white. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> is the reincarnation of a goddess who has come to punish him for his mistreatment of Xi'er and other despotisms. He is so frightened that he is literally paralyzed. Xi'er recognizes that it is her arch-enemy and seizes the opportunity to take further revenge. She picks up the brass incense burner and hurls it against the landlord. The landlord and his gang flee.|$|E

He is an aviator and an adventurer. When he moves with Amaranta Ursula to Macondo <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> {{is only a matter}} of time before she realizes that her European ways are out of place, causing her to want to move back to Europe. However, when he realizes his wife intends to stay in Macondo, he {{arranges}} for his airplane to be shipped over so he can start an airmail service. The plane is shipped to Africa by mistake. When he travels there to claim it, Amaranta writes him of her love for Aureliano Babilonia Buendía. Gastón takes the news in stride, only asking that they ship him his velocipede.|$|E
25|$|The Chief Justice may direct {{that the}} District Court {{to hear and}} {{determine}} certain types of proceedings when <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> is necessary or expedient to improve efficiency in the administration of justice and to provide for the speedier disposal of proceedings started in the High Court. In 1996 aspects of the High Court's jurisdiction to hear matrimonial cases were transferred to a dedicated Family Court, which is constituted as a District Court. As of December 2007, the Family Court hears proceedings relating to divorce, division of matrimonial assets and guardianship of children, including matters over which it has concurrent jurisdiction with the Syariah Court. However, contested applications for the division of matrimonial assets where the net value asserted by any party to the proceedings is of or above $1.5 million are transferred back to the High Court. Decisions made by the Family Court may be appealed to the High Court, but no further appeal may be brought to the Court of Appeal unless the Court of Appeal or a Judge of the High Court grants leave for such an appeal.|$|E
500|$|Trials and Tribulations {{was written}} and {{directed}} by Shu Takumi, with art by Tatsuro Iwamoto and music by Noriyuki Iwadare. After development of the original Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney was finished, Takumi's boss, Shinji Mikami, told him that they should make an Ace Attorney trilogy, with a grand finale in the third game's last case. As Takumi wanted the three first Ace Attorney games to be parts of a larger work, he avoided making a lot of changes: art for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth was reused from the first game, to avoid having the previous games look outdated in comparison to newer games in the series; and no new gameplay mechanics were added for Trials and Tribulations, as Takumi was happy with the gameplay after having added the psyche-lock mechanic for Justice for All. He wanted the series to end with Trials and Tribulations, as he had explored Phoenix's character fully and wanted to avoid the series becoming [...] "a shadow of its former self", saying that <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> is important to know when to end a story.|$|E

Small Alison has a homework assignment to draw a map of places her family has lived, but Bruce aggressively takes over, drawing it the way <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> should look. Alison realizes that despite having traveled and lived in Europe, her father's place of birth, life, work and death can all {{be placed in a}} small circle in Beech Creek, Pennsylvania ("Maps"). Bruce offers a ride and a beer to an underage boy, and it is later implied that they had a sexual encounter. Medium Alison writes to her parents, asking for a response to her coming-out letter. Small Alison watches The Partridge Family, but Bruce switches it off. Small Alison talks to him, and finds out {{that he is going to}} see a psychiatrist because he is [...] "bad" [...] and not good like her. Alison expresses annoyance that he lied to her; the actual reason he was going was because he was arrested for what he did to the underage boy. Helen tells Small Alison that the psychiatrist will help her father, and attempts to reassure her. Bruce starts a vicious argument with Helen and breaks several of her possessions along with some library books. Small Alison fantasizes about her family as the happy family singing together on television ("Raincoat of Love").|$|E

The women end up finding a letter addressed to Mary Alice, a blackmail note reading, [...] "I know what you did, it makes me sick, I’m going to tell." [...] Thereafter, the women make a series of discoveries concerning Mary Alice’s past and her possible motives for ending her life; she was being treated by Dr. Albert Goldfine (Sam Lloyd) where she revealed that she once went by the name Angela, and she may {{have had something to}} do with a baby that went missing. [...] Paul soon discovers who sent Mary Alice the note, their next-door neighbor struggling with financial difficulty, Martha Huber (Christine Estabrook), whom he ends up strangling to death out of pure rage and burying her body in the nearby forest. Meanwhile, her son Zach begins having flashbacks and is under the impression he killed a baby named Dana, who he believed to be his younger sister and reveals this to Julie Mayer (Andrea Bowen), Susan’s daughter. Paul worries over what Susan is spreading about their family, so he tells Susan in private that Zach accidentally killed his younger sister, Dana, and that he and Mary Alice covered it up to protect him. However, it becomes evident that this is not the case when Paul tells Zach that Dana is still very much alive.|$|E
