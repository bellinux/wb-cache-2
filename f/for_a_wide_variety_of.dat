5|$|One {{short-lived}} gamma ray-emitting {{nuclear isomer}} of technetium—technetium-99m—is used in nuclear medicine <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> diagnostic tests. The ground state of this nuclide, technetium-99, {{is used as}} a gamma-ray-free source of beta particles. Long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are by-products of the fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods. Because no isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than 4.2million years (technetium-98), the 1952 detection of technetium in red giants, which are billions of years old, helped to prove that stars can produce heavier elements.|$|E

The main attraction of the dromedary for nomadic desert-dwellers is the wide variety of resources they provide, which are crucial for their survival. It is important for several Bedouin pastoralist tribes of northern Arabia, such as the Ruwallah, the Bani Sakhr and the Mutayr.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} recorded incidents to affect the town was the Bristol Channel floods of 1607, since when various flood defences have been installed. In 1911 a concrete wall was built. After the Second World War, further additions to the defences against the sea were added by bringing part of {{the remains of a}} Mulberry harbour used for the Normandy Landings, and burying them in the sand. Today the town is defended from flooding by a large curved concrete wall, completed in 1988 following serious flooding in 1981. The wall runs along the Esplanade, and serves as the canvas <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> graffiti and street art.|$|E

At one such establishment on the Riviera, he met Jamila Ben M'Barek (born c. 1961), a divorcée and the mother of two children from a previous relationship. She was one of seven children born in Paris to a Tunisian mother and Moroccan father. In 1993, M'Barek had posed naked in Playboy, but it did not cause alarm. They were married on 5 November 2002, at Hilversum in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The Nueces estuary {{provides}} an ecosystem <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> wildlife. However, since {{the construction of}} Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1985, freshwater inflows have decreased from the Nueces River, increasing the bay's salinity, and hurting the natural oyster and shrimp habitat. In response, the City of Corpus Christi, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and two additional state agencies have worked to restore the natural freshwater inflows into the bay. The Odem Bay extension is low in salinity {{and serves as a}} nursery for shrimp, which migrate to Nueces Bay in spring. Oyster beds are common throughout the bay and are known to be hiding spots for such fish as trout, black drum, flounder and redfish. Such finfish must be protected from excessive freshwater introduction for survival.|$|E

5|$|The lake {{is located}} in the {{approximate}} geographic centre of the city, and is the centrepiece of the capital in accordance with Griffin's original designs. Numerous important institutions, such as the National Gallery, National Museum, National Library, Australian National University and the High Court were built on its shores, and Parliament House is a short distance away. Its surrounds, consisting mainly of parklands, are popular with recreational users, particularly in the warmer months.

5|$|As {{a second}} level {{administrative}} division municipalities are the third tier of public {{administration in the}} Netherlands after the central government and the provinces. The Netherlands is a decentralized unitary state, {{which means that the}} central government is supreme and delegates certain tasks to lower levels of government by law. The different levels do, however, make work agreements, which give municipalities a certain degree of independence in their policy decisions. Municipalities are responsible <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> public services, which include land-use planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, waste management and social security. After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010 three special municipalities (officially public bodies) were formed. These municipalities function the same as regular municipalities and are grouped together as the Caribbean Netherlands and are not part of a province.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{collections}} are used <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> purposes. All biological species {{including those of}} birds are represented by a holotype, {{the vast majority of}} which are full specimens (mostly skins) and in modern times explicitly designated in the original description of the taxon. All other putative members of the species may be compared to the holotype to confirm their identification. Rigorous studies of avian taxonomy are based on specimens from bird collections. Taxonomic studies rely on morphological and genetic characters to determine species limits and evolutionary relationships. Museum specimens have been the preferred source for scoring these s, as they allow studies to be replicated – anyone may go back and repeat the study using the same specimens to verify the conclusions. However, it has alternatively been argued that such re-examination can be undertaken from archived photographs without killing the study piece.|$|E
