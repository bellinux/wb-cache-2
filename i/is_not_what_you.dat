[...] Teammate Frank Lampard was also keen {{to win his}} first trophy: [...] "If you haven't won anything, a runners-up medal <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want at all." [...] He also stated that Chelsea manager José Mourinho's desire to win had been rubbing off on the players: [...] "He actually gets angrier with each one, so every time we lose it's the worst I've seen him, he's a winner, though, that's what you expect, and that's the attitude that's needed at Chelsea these days." ...|$|E
500|$|Time Out {{gave the}} film a mostly {{positive}} review, writing, [...] "While Django remains the erratic Corbucci's best picture, this slightly later spaghetti Western does well by an inventive set-up [...] between the bullets there's engaging {{stuff from the}} two stars and an unmistakable chill in the air". Film critic Leonard Maltin praised the film, awarding it 3 1/2 {{out of a possible}} 4 stars. In his review he wrote that The Great Silence is a [...] "brutal, bleakly beautiful spaghetti Western filmed on stark locations in the Dolomites, {{with one of the most}} uncompromising and unforgettable finales ever filmed". Kyle Anderson of Nerdist News described the film as Corbucci's [...] "most artful and daring" [...] Western, one that [...] "pushes the genre to new levels and creates a story unlike anything people were used to, even though it's likely more historically accurate". He concluded his review by stating that [...] "If you're looking for a good time on a Saturday night, I'd say this movie <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want, but if you're looking for a dark, violent, thoughtful, and well-made film, look no further".|$|E

2500|$|... "Beware of Darkness" [...] is a ballad {{containing}} dense imagery. The song marks {{a return}} to the spiritual concerns of Harrison's songs with the Beatles such as [...] "Within You Without You". The lyrics of [...] "Beware of Darkness" [...] reflect the philosophy of the Radha Krishna Temple, with which Harrison was involved, in which spiritual concerns must always override material things. In the verses, the listener is warned against various influences that may corrupt him or her. Among the potential corrupting influences are con men ("soft shoe shufflers"), politicians ("greedy leaders") and pop idols of little substance ("falling swingers"). In addition, the lyrics warn against negative thoughts ("thoughts that linger"), since these corrupting influences and negative thoughts can lead to maya, or illusion, which distracts people from the true purpose of life.
