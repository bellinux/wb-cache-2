5|$|On 1 September 1989, Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi founded Braathens Helikopter. The {{shipping}} company had {{signed an agreement}} with the oil companies Norsk Hydro, Phillips Petroleum and Statoil to provide <b>helicopter</b> <b>transport</b> for their crews to their offshore oil installations Ekofisk, Oseberg, Gullfaks, Veslefrikk. This {{was the first time the}} incumbent Helikopter Service had received competition on their offshore helicopter services. The initial agreement secured Braathens Helikopter a revenue of NOK800 million in the course of five years, and gave the company a 20% market share. Four 19-seet Aérospatiale Super Puma helicopters were ordered, each costing NOK60 million. Total investment costs were NOK300 million. Two helicopters were stationed at Stavanger Airport, Sola and two at Bergen Airport, Flesland. The initial contract involved flying 10,000 passengers per year.|$|E
25|$|Maersk Oil {{secured a}} {{monopoly}} in 1962 on exploration and extraction of any offshore petroleum in the Danish economic zone. By the 1970s they were operating oil platforms and needed <b>helicopter</b> <b>transport</b> to these. Maersk Air was contracted to perform this deed, {{for which it}} bought two Bell 212 helicopters. The airline stationed these at Esbjerg Airport and they commenced operations on 1 July 1975.|$|E
25|$|Farsund Airport's main {{advantage}} is the long runway. This allows for large cargo aircraft {{and the occasional}} charter flight with large passenger aircraft. Lista {{can also be used}} in case of a closing of Kjevik. However, these uses occur only sporadically. There were also plans to use the airport for offshore <b>helicopter</b> <b>transport</b> to oil platforms in the North Sea. However, the lack of infrastructure, lack of a freeway to Kristiansand and lack of scheduled flights caused these plans to be terminated.|$|E

25|$|Braathens Helikopter was {{established}} by Braganza in 1989 after negotiating agreements with Norsk Hydro, Phillips Petroleum and Statoil to provide <b>helicopter</b> <b>transport</b> for their crews to their offshore oil installations Ekofisk, Oseberg, Gullfaks, Veslefrikk. This {{was the first time}} the incumbent Helikopter Service had received competition on their offshore helicopter services. Four 19-seet Aérospatiale Super Puma helicopters were ordered. Services started on 1 September 1990. In 1992 the helicopter airline signed an agreement to fly for British Petroleum to Ula and Gyda. Braathens Helikopter and Helikopter Service announced on 1 October 1993 that the two companies would merge from 1 January 1994.|$|E
25|$|After the German reunification in 1990, {{the wings}} of the former East German Air Force were {{integrated}} into the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr). To this effect new wings, now under the command of the Luftwaffe, were created. One such wing was Air Transport Wing 65 based at Brandenburg-Briest Air Base and flying Mil Mi-8 helicopters. This wing was disbanded in January 1993 and reformed as an air transport detachment. This detachment subsequently became subordinate to Air Transport Wing 62. In September 1993, <b>Helicopter</b> <b>Transport</b> Wing 64, based at Ahlhorn Air Base, was also disbanded, and 35 Bell UH-1D helicopters were integrated into Air Transport Wing 62.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of these data from the 6 {{existing}} populations of Newcomb's snails can be estimated a total population of approximately 6,000 to 7,000 individuals. The great majority of these snails, perhaps over 90%, were located in the two populations at Kalalau and Lumaha`i. Terrain occupied by Newcomb's snail populations is remote and extremely rugged. Three of the six populations can only be visited using <b>helicopter</b> <b>transport,</b> although the Kalalau Stream population potentially could be accessed in summer months with boat support and strenuous hiking. Because of the difficulty in accessing the sites, no comprehensive Newcomb's snail population census has been undertaken since 1995, and changes to the population since that time remain undocumented.|$|E

When the road is closed because of avalanches and land slides, <b>helicopter</b> <b>transport</b> is used. There is a road connecting all the antennas to ease maintenance. Installations at SvalSat not related to satellite communication include a measuring station for radioactive particles in the air operated by Norwegian Seismic Array, a telecommunications installation operated by Telenor, a weather station operated by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, with information relayed to Svalbard Airport, Longyear, and a weather station operated by SvalSat.|$|E

This detachment was responsible for air transport missions within the SAR commands at Holzdorf and Erfurt, {{as well as the}} emergency services centre at Neustrelitz. In the following years, these helicopters took part in several SAR missions both within Germany as well as abroad, notably during the 1997 Central European flood and the 2002 European floods.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Dr. R Adams Cowley was {{instrumental}} {{in the creation of the}} country's first statewide EMS program, in Maryland. The system was called the Division of Emergency Medical Services (now known as the [...] ). Also in 1969, Cowley obtained a military helicopter to assist in rapidly transporting patients to the Center for the Study of Trauma (now known as the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center), a specialized hospital that he had started for the purpose of treating shock. This service was not only the first statewide EMS program, but also the beginning of modern emergency medical <b>helicopter</b> <b>transport</b> in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|After World War II, most {{propeller}} aircraft were gradually {{phased out}} as jet aircraft improved and helicopters were developed {{for use in}} amphibious operations.The first Marine jet squadron came in November 1947 when VMF-122 fielded the FH Phantom, and four years later VMF-311 {{would be the first}} Marine jet squadron to be used in combat providing close air support for the Marines and soldiers on the ground in December 1950 flying the F9F Panther. HMX-1, the first Marine helicopter squadron, stood up in November 1947. Marine helicopters—VMO-6 flying the HO3S1 helicopter—made their combat debut in August 1950's Battle of Pusan Perimeter. January 1951 saw the activation of HMR-161, the world's first <b>helicopter</b> <b>transport</b> squadron. In February 1957, VMA-214 became the first Marine squadron to be certified for [...] "special weapons delivery": dropping nuclear weapons, several other would receive certification. Though eventually all nuclear weapons were turned over to Navy and Air Force responsibility.|$|E
2500|$|Elsewhere, {{the novel}} {{approach}} to pre-hospital care was also evolving. [...] Portland's Leonard Rose, M.D., {{in cooperation with}} Buck Ambulance Service, instituted a cardiac training program and began training other paramedics. Baltimore's R. Adams Cowley, the father of trauma medicine, devised the concept of integrated emergency care, designing the first civilian Medevac helicopter program and campaigning for a statewide EMS system. Other communities that were early participants {{in the development of}} paramedicine included Jacksonville, Florida, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (in an expanded program), and Seattle, Washington (in an expanded program). In 1972 the first civilian emergency medical <b>helicopter</b> <b>transport</b> service, Flight for Life opened in Denver, Colorado. Emergency medical helicopters were soon put into service elsewhere in the United States. [...] It is now routine to have paramedic and nurse-staffed EMS helicopters in most major metropolitan areas. The vast majority of these aeromedical services are utilized for critical care air transport (inter-hospital) in addition to emergency medical services (pre-hospital).|$|E
