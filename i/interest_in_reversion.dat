40|$|Malang Walikan {{is a kind}} of {{language}} that uses reversed words in which Malang people use in their daily-conversation, especially in informal talks. Usually it is the younger generations who use such language more often than the older ones. There are three reasons why the writer is <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> analyzing Malang <b>reversion.</b> The first reason is because she has many friends who live in Malang and use the reversion everyday. The second is she is curious about the usage of Malang reversion. She becomes more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> such <b>reversion</b> after she read a thesis of Malang reversion done by former student of IKIP Malang in 1976. This study tries to find out the various types of Malang Walikan. Another important focus {{of this study is to}} determine the source languages of Malang Walikan. This study is also a kind of further study of similar research conducted by Melik Sumanandar. The reason is to find out the proves of the writer's disagreement to Sumanandar's findings. After a thorough analysis, it is revealed that Malang Walikan can be divided into three types of words; Systematic reversion, Fluctuated reversion, and Slang. There is a particular formula to form systematic reversion, while the other two types could not be found any formula. The formula is: p l + P 2 + [...] . + p x becomes Px +P(x- 1) + [...] +P 1 The words of Systematic and Fluctuated reversions are derived from Indonesian and Javanese since the people of Malang are influenced by the usage of both languages. Thus, the domination of Indonesian words can be seen obviously in both types of reversion...|$|R

40|$|Both the {{acridine}} half-mustard, ICR 191, and the nonalkylating azaacridine derivative, ICR 364 -OH, induce {{three classes}} of frameshift mutations in the histidine operon of Salmonella typhimurium. (i) One class is completely stable <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> tests and {{is presumed to}} represent deletion of {{one or a few}} critical nucleotide pairs or two nearby frameshifts. One extended deletion was found out of 11 stable mutations. (ii) Of two spontaneously reverting classes which also are considered to predominantly involve base deletions, one is unaffected <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> with ICR 191, nitrosoguanidine, and diethylsulfate, and the other is induced to revert with ICR 191. (iii) A third class, considered to predominantly involve base additions, responds <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> tests with ICR 191 as well as with nitrosoguanidine and diethylsulfate. Other investigators have shown that one mutant of this class is a “plus” frameshift and that nitrosoguanidine acts <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> to delete a guanine plus cytosine base pair. Although such plus frameshifts are found with high frequency among mutations selected from acridine-treated bacteria or when strong selection pressure is applied for their detection <b>in</b> <b>reversion</b> tests, data from this laboratory indicate that this class of plus frameshifts is rare among mutations derived spontaneously or after treatment with a variety of other mutagens. Finally, we demonstrate that the alkylating ICR 191 and the nonalkylating ICR 364 -OH preferentially cause mutations in different chromosome regions and that their spectra of activity only partially overlap that found for spontaneous frameshift mutations...|$|R

Hope lives not by sight, as faith doth; but hope trusteth faith, as faith trusts the Word, and so bears up the soul in a patient expectation at last to enjoy what God has promised. But I say, the very natural work of this grace proveth, that the believer's best things are behind <b>in</b> <b>reversion.</b>|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{investigates the}} {{characteristics}} of short-term <b>interest</b> rates <b>in</b> several countries. We examine the importance of nonlinearities <b>in</b> the mean <b>reversion</b> and volatility of short-term interest rates. We examine various models that allow the conditional mean (drift) and conditional variance (diffusion) to be functions of the current short rate. We find that different markets require different models. In particular, we find evidence of nonlinear mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> some of the countries that we examine, linear mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> others and no mean <b>reversion</b> <b>in</b> some countries. For all countries we examine, there is strong evidence {{of the need for}} the volatility of interest rate changes to be highly sensitive {{to the level of the}} short-term interest rate. Out-of-sample forecasting performance of one-factor short rate models is poor, stemming from the inability of the models to accommodate jumps and discontinuities in the time series data.
