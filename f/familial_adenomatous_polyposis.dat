25|$|Mutations and {{overexpression}} of β-catenin {{are associated}} with many cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, lung cancer, malignant breast tumors, ovarian and endometrial cancer. Alterations in the localization and expression levels of beta-catenin {{have been associated with}} various forms of heart disease, including dilated cardiomyopathy. β-catenin is regulated and destroyed by the beta-catenin destruction complex, and in particular by the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein, encoded by the tumour-suppressing APC gene. Therefore, genetic mutation of the APC gene is also strongly linked to cancers, and in particular colorectal cancer resulting from <b>familial</b> <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> (FAP).|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} 2 extended kindreds supposedly manifesting <b>familial</b> multiple <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> coli (FPC), {{but which}} show marked heterogeneity in the phenotypic expression of colorectal adenomatous polyps. In one family, 2 individuals had diffuse polyposis at very early ages (7 and 10 years), while 6 others (aged 23 to 72 years) had solitary polyps only. Of the patients with solitary polyps, 2 had associated colonic malignancies (ages 26 and 35), while another had a prophylactic colectomy performed at age 46. In the second family, 5 of the 11 patients {{with evidence of}} polyps showed the classical presentation of FPC, while the remainder showed marked phenotypic variation. The marked variability in frequency and location of colon polyps {{points to the need}} to reassess our traditional criteria for diagnosis of FPC.

40|$|The <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> coli gene {{is a key}} tumor {{suppressor}} gene. Alterations in {{this gene}} {{have been found in}} most sporadic colon cancers; associated with <b>familial</b> <b>adenomatous</b> polyposis; and found in neoplasms of other organs, such as the liver, stomach, lung, breast, and cerebellar medulloblastoma. In the heterogeneous group of neuroendocrine neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract, the involvement of <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> coli is debated, and only occasional reports found <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> coli alterations in foregut and midgut neuroendocrine neoplasms, with <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> coli mutations only in the latter. To elucidate the penetrance of <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> coli alterations in ileal neuroendocrine neoplasms, we performed DNA fragment analysis (loss of heterozygosity for 5 q 22 - 23 and 5 q 23) and sequencing on the mutation cluster region of the <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> coli gene on 30 ileal enterochromaffin cell neuroendocrine neoplasms. <b>Adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> coli gene mutations were detected in 23 % of cases (7 / 30); in particular, 57 % were missense and 14 %, nonsense/frameshift, all novel and different from those reported in colorectal or other cancers. Loss of heterozygosity analysis demonstrated a deletion frequency of 15 % (4 / 27). No association was found with features of tumor progression. Our observations support the involvement of somatic <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> coli alterations in tumorigenesis of ileal enterochromaffin cell neuroendocrine neoplasms; the mechanisms of <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> coli gene inactivation appear to be different from those reported in other tumor types...|$|R
25|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} a disease of old age: It {{typically}} originates in the secretory cells lining the gut, and risk factors include diets low in vegetable fibre and high in fat. If a younger person gets such a cancer, it {{is often associated with}} hereditary syndromes like Peutz-Jegher's, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or <b>familial</b> <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis.</b> Colorectal cancer can be detected through the bleeding of a polyp, colicky bowel pain, a bowel obstruction or the biopsy of a polyp at a screening colonoscopy. A constant feeling of having to go to the toilet or anemia might also point to this kind of cancer.|$|E
25|$|Most {{colorectal}} cancers {{are due to}} old age {{and lifestyle}} factors with {{only a small number}} of cases due to underlying genetic disorders. Some risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red and processed meat as well as alcohol. Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include <b>familial</b> <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases. It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous.|$|E
25|$|<b>Familial</b> <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> (FAP) is an {{inherited}} {{condition in which}} numerous adenomatous polyps form mainly in the epithelium of the large intestine. While these polyps start out benign, malignant transformation into colon cancer occurs when they are left untreated. Three variants are known to exist, FAP and attenuated FAP (originally called hereditary flat adenoma syndrome) are caused by APC gene defects on chromosome 5 while autosomal recessive FAP (or MYH-associated polyposis) is caused by defects in the MUTYH gene on chromosome 1. Of the three, FAP itself is the most severe and most common; although for all three, the resulting colonic polyps and cancers are confined to the colon wall and removal can greatly reduce the spread of cancer.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMutations in the APC (<b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> coli) gene, which encodes a multi-functional protein with a {{well-defined}} {{role in the}} canonical Wnt pathway, underlie <b>familial</b> <b>adenomatous</b> polypsosis, a rare, inherited form of colorectal cancer (CRC) {{and contribute to the}} majority of sporadic CRCs. However, not all sporadic and familial CRCs can be explained by mutations in APC or other genes with well-established roles in CRC.

Here, we review AXIN 1 and AXIN 2 sequence alterations reported in gastrointestinal cancers, with the goal of vetting the evidence that some of the variants may have key functional roles in cancer development...|$|R
25|$|Those with {{a family}} history in two or more first-degree {{relatives}} (such as a parent or sibling) have a two to threefold greater risk of disease and this group accounts for about 20% of all cases. A number of genetic syndromes are also associated with higher rates of colorectal cancer. The most common of these is hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome) which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer. Other syndromes that are strongly associated with colorectal cancer include Gardner syndrome, and <b>familial</b> <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> (FAP). For people with these syndromes, cancer almost always occurs and makes up 1% of the cancer cases. A total proctocolectomy may be recommended for people with FAP as a preventative measure due to the high risk of malignancy.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>Adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> of {{the colon}} is often {{secondary}} to an inherited mutation in <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> coli (APC) gene, however, approximately one third of patients have no family history of the disease. We studied the phenotype and genotype of <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> in patients without a family history. METHODS: A cohort of 57 unrelated <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> patients were evaluated. Seventeen patients with no family history were compared with 40 patients who had a positive family history of the disease. Family history and medical records were collected and analyzed. Germline APC and Mut Y homologue (MYH) testing was undertaken. RESULTS: Patients without a family history were diagnosed with polyposis at an older age (41 years vs. 32 years) and presenting more frequently with symptoms (76 vs 20, P < 0. 05). The number of colonic polyps and frequency of extracolonic manifestation associated with <b>adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> did not differ between the two groups. APC mutations were detected less frequently among patients without {{a family history of}} the disease (4 out of 17 vs 25 out of 40, P= 0. 007), even among those with greater than 100 colorectal adenomas (4 out of 12 versus 21 out of 29, P= 0. 03). One homozygous MYH mutation carrier (G 382 D) was detected among the six patients without a family history and without a germline APC mutation who were tested. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Adenomatous</b> <b>polyposis</b> patients without a family history are usually diagnosed with symptoms, and at a later age. Phenotypically, they are similar to those with a family history. However, germline APC mutations are detected far less frequently in patients without a family history. A small percentage of these cases may be secondary to biallelic germline MYH mutations...|$|R
