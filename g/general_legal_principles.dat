40|$|The {{central issue}} {{regarding}} non-regular employees is {{the disparity in}} compensation compared to regular employees. There are three policy choices to resolve this issue: (1) the basic principle of same compensation for same career, (2) the basic principle of same compensation for same work, and (3) the basic principle of prohibiting discriminatory treatment without an objective reason. Of these choices, article 8 of the Part-time Labor Act adopts (1) the basic principle of same compensation for same career, and the Democratic Party of Japan's manifesto (2009) extols the basic principle of same pay for same work (one form of (2) the basic principle of same compensation for same work). A <b>general</b> <b>legal</b> <b>principle</b> based on a particular form (same career or same work) is not applicable to other types of employment systems and creates the problem {{of not being able}} to address the various benefits not directly connected to career or work duties, such as commuting allowance, in-house cafeterias, and health examinations. While France and Germany have adopted (2) the <b>general</b> <b>legal</b> <b>principle</b> of same compensation for same work, their systems, in fact, operate in line with (3) the basic principle of prohibiting discriminatory treatment without an objective reason in order to resolve the issue. With an assumption of diverse and broad benefits for employees and diversified and multi-track human resource systems (wage systems), Japan has also adopted (3) the basic principle of prohibiting discriminatory treatment without an objective reason; responses that incorporate diversity of particular situations for determining objective reason are likely appropriate in terms of theory and practice. In this paper, I clarify in concrete terms the details and nature of this principle (in particular, guidelines for interpreting objective reason and the concrete framework for decisions) while looking at various aspects such as the debate in France and Germany and show how to respond to problems in implementing this principle (low predictability). ...|$|R

Furthermore, its inclusion into the legal system of the Croatian administrative law is taken into consideration, both in terms of laws which are applied in specific administrative fields and in the Law of the General Administrative Procedure. Its frequency of usage in the administrative adjudication is analysed, and the criteria for its applicability are determined.

This crisis {{highlights}} {{the need to}} explain the following questions: What {{is the relationship between}} refugee law and immigration policy? How much immigration do States need to tolerate for moral and practical reasons even if they do not wish any immigration? The <b>general</b> <b>legal</b> <b>principle</b> of necessity offers a useful theoretical basis for refugee law. Necessity explains the conditions under which it would be unfair to fight off unwanted immigrants by deportation and punishment. Necessity also explains the conditions under which a restrictive immigration policy is not feasible at a reasonable cost versus desperate individuals. It follows that necessity overrules a restrictive immigration policy and qualifies as a robust explanation of the purpose of a fair refugee policy. This study explores the consequences of the theory of necessity for the interpretation of key concepts of refugee law (persecution, well-founded fear, reasons of persecution, asylum) and concludes that a generous refugee practice can be conceived and logically justified even if a restrictive immigration policy is a political reality...|$|R
40|$|In this article, I {{endeavour}} {{to examine}} concrete challenges that arise {{with regard to}} implementation of the precautionary principle {{in the field of}} European Union regulation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Developed by the European courts into a <b>general</b> <b>legal</b> <b>principle,</b> precaution requires EU regulators {{to strike a balance between}} scientific and political legitimacy when taking decisions on risk-entailing products. Following this understanding, the current GMO legislation creates precautionary governance structures that allow for a broad input into the authorisation process, not only of scientific, but also of 'other legitimate factors'. At the same time, it can be criticised for narrowly defining precaution as a decision rule, which, if applied correctly, will lead the decision maker to the 'right' decision. I argue that this misconception is one of the reasons why, in the current authorisation practice, the EU institutions fail to apply the principle in a balanced way, falling into the extremes of either purely science-based decision making or a highly politicised precautionary rhetoric. I suggest that in order not to be paralysing, precaution should be understood as a procedural principle that provides for precautionary governance, thus enabling regulators to make appropriate risk choices...|$|R
40|$|My master's thesis titled "Legal Professions {{involved}} in the justice system" is focused on a notary public. This chosen legal profession originates from the ancient Rome. In this historical period was constituted a tradition of the profession existing in the continental legal system. Notary public has a specific position among legal professions on grounds of its functions. Notarial activities are patterned on a <b>general</b> <b>legal</b> <b>principle</b> including constitutional conventions (principles). The purpose of my thesis is to analyse and describe a performance of this profession by notaries in their practice. The text of the thesis is composed of seven chapters. The first of them deals with some elementary information about the notary public {{as a type of}} legal profession, the difference between legal aid and legal services and eventually the form of regulation of particular professions which are regulated by special Acts such as the Code of Notarial Practice (the Notarial Act). The Chapter Two focuses on the history of this legal profession and the impact on the current form in the Czech Republic. In the Third Chapter titled "A Notary in the legal order of the Czech Republic" I described some key words from their practise and a subject matter, for example a notary (notary public), notarial activity, an [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|The Restatement (2d) of Property, {{which is}} a {{treatise}} describing <b>general</b> <b>legal</b> <b>principles</b> applied by the courts in the United States states that Infectious invalidity means that the failure of certain transfers may cause interests that are otherwise valid to fail also. This approach was taken in New England Trust Co. v. Sanger, 337 Mass. 342, 149 N.E.2d 598 (1958). A trust provided for income {{to be paid to}} the surviving children of the settlor's brother for life, and on the death of the last surviving child of the settlor's brother, an equal division of the trust principle was to be made among the issue of the children of the settlor's brother. The gift to the issue of the brother's children failed, because the ascertainment of issue could not be made until the brother's children died, and the brother might have children born after the creation of the trust who might not die within the permissible period. However, a later trust had been established by the settlor, which stated that if any provision in the first trust indenture should be declared invalid, any income or principal which reverted to his estate should be deemed held in trust by the settlor for the benefit of his brother's children and their issue. Applying the doctrine of infectious invalidity to avoid a distortion of the settlor's [...] "clear desire," [...] the court held that the second trust should govern the trust distribution. It stated that by striking down all the gifts, valid and invalid, made in the first trust, and by giving effect to the second trust, the settlor's plan for the income gifts was substantially carried out. 1.5 comment 7 ...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction. The European Court of Justice, partly {{followed}} in this by the European legislator, has regulated Community {{law and policy}} {{through a set of}} general principles of law. For the Community legal order in the first pillar, <b>general</b> <b>legal</b> <b>principles</b> have developed from functional policy areas such as the internal market, the customs union, the monetary union, the common agricultural policy, the European competition policy, etc., which are of great importance for the quality and legitimacy of Community law. The principles in question are not so much <b>general</b> <b>legal</b> <b>principles</b> of an institutional character, such as the priority of Community law, direct effect or Community loyalty, but rather principles of law which shape the fundamental rights and basic rights of the citizen. I refer to the principle of legality, of nulla poena, the inviolability of the home, the nemo tenetur principle, due process, the rights of the defence, etc. Many of these legal principles have been elevated to primary Community law status by the European Court of Justice, often as a result of preliminary questions. Nevertheless, a considerable number of them have also been elaborated in the context of contentious proceedings before the Court of Justice, such as in the framework of European competition law and European public servants law...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} if a transfer restriction in a conveyance of real property for consideration is legally binding. In doctrine the legal situation is described as unclear. It will also be investigated if the restriction is binding {{in relation to the}} acquirer´s creditors and in relation to a new owner of the property. A transfer restriction in a conveyance of real property for consideration is legally binding between the parties and in relation to a new owner of the property. Even though the restriction is binding between the parties and in relation to a new owner, it is not binding in relation to the acquirer´s creditors. The Supreme Court has stated that it is a <b>general</b> <b>legal</b> <b>principle</b> that a transfer restriction in a conveyance for consideration is not binding in relation to the acquirer´s creditors. In this thesis it will also be argued that the legal situation is inconsequent. The reason for the inconsistency is that a restriction which stipulates a pre-emption right in a conveyance of real property for consideration is not legally binding. A pre-emption right and a transfer restriction mean the same thing for the acquirer. Both conditions limit the acquirer´s right to transfer the property...|$|R
40|$|Prohibition {{of abuse}} {{of law is}} a <b>general</b> <b>legal</b> <b>principle.</b> It enables judge not to follow wording of certain {{prohibition}} of law, if he comes to conclusion that the tax subject abuses law contrary to its purpose. As the result, the respective tax subject is not granted with that right. In the Czech Republic this principle can be found mostly {{in the area of}} private law. However it is more controversial in the tax law area, where the principle of abuse of law serves as an instrument for hindering too aggressive tax planning. This thesis deals with the principle from various points of view. After a theoretical introduction it describes evolution of the doctrine in the European law, from where the so callled "two-tier abuse test" was implemented into Czech tax law. Few examples are provided to describe the concept of abuse of law in private law, where this principle forms a subset of conducts contrary to bonos mores. Then the work describes the judicial doctrine of the Supreme Administrative Court in tax matters. Since 2005 the notion of abuse of law has been determined and defined towards other institutes which serve as weapons of Tax Authorities against too aggressive tax planning. These other institutes are sham transactions (dissimulation), tax fraud or even invalidity of the transaction due to non-compliance [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Unjustified {{enrichment}} is used {{as legal}} basis when a part claims compensation. Unjustified enrichment can be illustrated as: (A) made a profit on someone else’s loss (B) and if the profit is"unjustified"and has"no legal basis"it shall be returned, which then {{make it possible for}} B to claim compensation from A referring to the profit. B has in this case lost something that he owns. To be able to claim A for compensation must the loss of B also be a benefit for A. The purpose with this rule is to equalize the transaction between A and B with the benefit for A as basis. This thesis takes German law as starting point to find out whether unjustified enrichment can be considered a <b>general</b> <b>legal</b> principal that also can be used in different branches of law and if it can not be considered a <b>general</b> <b>legal</b> principal to discuss if unjustified enrichment should be such a principle. Differences between unjustified enrichment in the Swedish and German legal system has been detected. Inter alia that the courts in Sweden are not bound to follow the properties transformation and fusion with other properties when they try a situation that is to be solved under the principle of unjustified enrichment. The Swedish doctrine is doubtful to give unjustified enrichment validity in contract law. A conclusion that can be questioned {{because of the fact that}} Swedish case law uses unjustified enrichment as a <b>general</b> <b>legal</b> <b>principle</b> also in cases that includes contract law. Another fact that is important is that unjustified enrichment in other European Union memberstates have given unjustified enrichment validity also in contract law and when it has that status the EC-court can use it in cases, cases that have an impact on Sweden. Unjustified enrichment has in Sweden been considered diffuse and that it often occurs evidence difficulties. This problems are considered to hurt predictability and therefore also the rule of law. This also is questioned by the author because unjustified enrichment can be used when a mild form of compensation is suitable. With the profit as starting point will the winner not leave the dispute in a worse situation as if it never occurred...|$|R
