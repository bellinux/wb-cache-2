40|$|AbstractNeurons in the {{mammalian}} {{central nervous}} system are generated from progenitor cells near the lumen of the neural tube. Time-lapse microscopy of dividing cell in slices of developing cerebral cortex reveals that cleavage orientation predicts the fates of daughter cells. Vertical cleavages produce behaviorally and morphologically identical <b>daughters</b> <b>that</b> resemble precursor cells; these symmetric divisions may serve to expand or maintain the progenitor pool. In contrast, horizontally dividing cells produce basal <b>daughters</b> <b>that</b> behave like young migratory neurons and apical <b>daughters</b> <b>that</b> remain within the proliferative zone. Notchl immunoreactivity is distributed asymmetrically in mitotic cells, with Notchl inherited selectively by the basal (neuronal) daughter of horizontal divisions. These results provide cellular and molecular evidence that cortical neurons are generated from asymmetric divisions...|$|R
