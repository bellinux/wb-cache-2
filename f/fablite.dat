50|$|IMEC {{has driven}} the {{semiconductor}} roadmap {{for more than}} 30 years. With its global nanoelectronics open innovation platform, IMEC brings together the entire semiconductor eco system including the leading foundries, IDMs, fabless and <b>fablite</b> companies, material and equipment suppliers. Together with its partners, IMEC develops new technologies and processes for sub-10 nm CMOS scaling, both for logic and memory technology. Looking even 10 years ahead, they explore options to create chips with transistor dimensions smaller than 5 nm. With their global leading semiconductor partners, they pioneer the use of new materials and transistor architectures, processing technologies, integration and design methods.|$|E
