5|$|Various {{parts of}} the {{mushroom}} display characteristic color reactions to chemical tests commonly used in mushroom identification. The cap cuticle will turn a blackish color with {{the application of a}} <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> potassium hydroxide (KOH), iron sulfate (FeSO4) solution, or ammonia solution. The mushroom flesh turns grayish-green to greenish black with a <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> FeSO4, and olive to greenish black with KOH or NH4OH.|$|E
5|$|A <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> dilute ammonia (as a 12% NH4OH solution) {{placed on}} the cap surface {{immediately}} turns dark red. If {{placed on the}} bulbous part of the stem base of a dried specimen, it will turn dark for roughly 15 seconds before starting to fade.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, or, in some cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments {{present in the}} fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions {{may be used as}} taxonomic characters. When a <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide is applied to the cap of B.mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades away. If a <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> commercial bleach (calcium hypochlorite) is applied, the tissue loses its color and becomes a pale blue.|$|E

5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.holopus.

5|$|The film's opening was {{considered}} a hit taking into account how the story was not based on a popular existing source, and the film itself was void of the franchise's main character, Harry Potter. It was the top choice among moviegoers, representing 47% of the weekend's total $157.6 million tickets sales. On its second Friday, it had a gradual <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> 37% ($18.5 million) from the week before, the second best Friday drop for any Harry Potter film, behind The Philosopher's Stone. This was {{in part due to}} Black Friday, the most lucrative day of the Thanksgiving Day stretch. It ended up grossing $45.1 million in its second weekend (a <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> just 39.4%), finishing 2nd at the box office behind newcomer Moana.|$|E
5|$|By 1929, the {{phenomenon}} of beta decay prompted Bohr to again suggest that the law of conservation of energy be abandoned, but Enrico Fermi's hypothetical neutrino and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the neutron provided another explanation. This prompted Bohr {{to create a new}} theory of the compound nucleus in 1936, which explained how neutrons could be captured by the nucleus. In this model, the nucleus could be deformed like a <b>drop</b> <b>of</b> liquid. He worked on this with a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938.|$|E
