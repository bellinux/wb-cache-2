This charge consists of fresh air, fuel, and residual gas from the previous cycle. Unfortunately, the residual gas fraction cannot be directly measured. Two experimental methods have been designed to determine the residual gas fraction. The reference method is based on an in-cylinder sampling method. The second one is based on a <b>hydrocarbon</b> (<b>HC)</b> <b>analysis</b> of the exhaust gases. Two models have been compared to the experimental results. A one-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code (WAVE) and a zero-dimensional model (AMESIM), which takes into account gas compressibility. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare the results of CFD codes (one- and zero-dimensional) to experimental results. If the code is validated by the experiments, it should be possible to determine residual gas fractions without needing a large experimental set-up...|$|E
40|$|The {{downward}} transport of air through the tropopause can bring {{substantial amounts of}} ozone and reactive nitrogen into the upper troposphere. In this cold region of the atmosphere, O 3 is particularly effective as a greenhouse gas. As part of the North Dakota Thunderstorm Project in June 1989, the NCAR Sabreliner made five flights through the tropopause. We measured ozone, nitric oxide (NO), total reactive nitrogen (NO(y)), carbon monoxide (CO), and water vapor (H 2)), and took grab samples for <b>hydrocarbon</b> (<b>HC)</b> <b>analysis.</b> Hydrocarbons, CO, and H 2 O, species with sources primarily at the earth's surface, showed a strong concentration decrease with increasing altitude, while O 3 and NO(y), species with a source in the stratosphere, showed a strong concentration increase with increasing altitude. Stratospheric concentrations of NO(x), NO(y), and H 2 O were all high relative to winter observations made during NASA's AASE. We suggest that midlatitude thunderstorms may inject wet, NO-rich air into the lower stratosphere. Calculation based on measured ratios of NO(x) and NO(y) to O 3 yield a total flux of reactive nitrogen from the Northern Hemisphere stratosphere into the troposphere of 1 to 2 Tg(N) yr(exp - 1) with about 8 percent {{in the form of}} NO(x). This value is higher than reported estimates of total stratospheric nitrogen fixation...|$|E

Similar testing has occurred at the HSWL (Hamilton Sundstrand Windsor Locks) facility. A NASA Executive Order bans the procurement of all ODS (ozone depleting substances), including Freon- 113 by the end of 2009. In order to comply with NASA direction, HSWL began evaluating viable solvents to replace Freon- 113. The study and testing effort to find Freon- 113 replacements used for Cold Trap sampling is the subject of this paper. Test results have shown HFE- 7100 (a 3 M fluorinated ether) to be an adequate replacement for Freon- 113 as a solvent to remove and measure the non-volatile residue collected in a Cold Trap during oxygen testing. Furthermore, S- 316 (a Horiba Instruments Inc. high molecular weight, non-ODS chlorofluorocarbon) was found to be an adequate replacement for Freon- 113 as a solvent to reconstitute non-volatile residue removed from a Cold Trap during oxygen testing for subsequent <b>HC</b> (<b>hydrocarbon)</b> <b>analysis</b> via FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{project is}} to {{determine}} the influence of ethanol fuel in engine emission. The main objective {{of this study is to}} compare the emission of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), <b>hydrocarbon</b> (<b>HC)</b> and nitrogen oxide (NOX) produce by gasoline with the emission of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), <b>hydrocarbon</b> (<b>HC)</b> and nitrogen oxide (NOX) produce by gasohol fuels which are ethanol 10 % (ethanol 10 % blended with gasoline 90 %), ethanol 85 % (ethanol 85 % blended with gasoline 15 %) and pure ethanol (ethanol 100 %). The engine model use in this project is build up according to Mitsubishi’s 4 G 92 which is use in Proton Wira. The simulation is conducted by using Gamma Technologies Software (GT-Power). The relation between the increasing of engine speed with the amount of emission and the amount of emission produced by each fuel is also discussed. Major finding shows that the emission of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), <b>hydrocarbon</b> (<b>HC)</b> and nitrogen oxide (NOX) decrease with the increase of blended ethanol in the fuel. Furthermore, although overall of the emission pattern results showed good agreement with previously published work even though the amount is different compare to the past studies but this is due to the engine parameters itself each engine have different parameter. The observation indicates that the emission of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), <b>hydrocarbon</b> (<b>HC)</b> and nitrogen oxide (NOX) produce by gasoline is the highest compare to the other fuel. In addition, the fuel that gives the cleanest emission is the pure ethanol (ethanol 100 %) ...|$|R

The dual fuel model was established by a linear combination for the <b>hydrocarbon</b> (<b>HC)</b> equivalent molecular mass, when there is 0 % and 100 % natural gas in the fuel.

40|$|Abstract: The initial 1 - 2 {{minutes of}} {{operation}} of an automotive spark-ignition engine, commonly called as the ”coldstart ” period, produces more than 75 - 80 % of the <b>hydrocarbon</b> (<b>HC)</b> emissions {{in a typical}} drive cycle. Model-based controller development requires accurate, yet simple, models that can run in real-time. Simple, intuitive models are developed to predict both tailpipe <b>hydrocarbon</b> (<b>HC)</b> emissions and exhaust temperature during coldstart. Each of the models is chosen to be sum of first order linear systems based on the experimental data and ease of parameter identification. Inputs to these models are AFR, spark timing and engine crankshaft speed. A reduced order thermodynamic model for the catalyst temperature is also developed. The parameters are identified using least squares technique. The model estimates for the coldstart are compared with the experimental results with good agreement.
