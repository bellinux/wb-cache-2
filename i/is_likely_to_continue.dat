5|$|Systematic botany {{is part of}} {{systematic}} biology, which {{is concerned with the}} range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history. It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, Portugal was {{the only}} European country to utilize the Portuguese dogfish. An {{important}} bycatch of the black scabbardfish (Aphanops carbo) longline fishery, between 300 and 900 tons of this shark were landed annually from 1986 to 1999. Its per-weight value has been increasing since 1986, and thus exploitation <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue.</b> Around 1990, French bottom trawlers began to fish for Portuguese dogfish and leafscale gulper sharks (Centrophorus squamosus) west of the British Isles for meat and livers; these two species are together referred to as siki. The siki catch peaked at 3,284 tons in 1996 before declining to 1,939 tons in 1999. The French have since been joined by Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish longliners and trawlers, making the Portuguese dogfish a significant component of deepwater fisheries in the northwest Atlantic. While stocks off Portugal seem to be stable for now, stocks off the British Isles have diminished substantially in recent years; this may reflect the disparity between the less massified Portuguese fishery and the commercial French fishery. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, because of its commercial value and low reproductive productivity.|$|E

25|$|The horse {{should have}} a reduced {{workload}} for 1–3 weeks. If a trainer does not decrease the workload sufficiently, and the splint bone continues to receive concussion, the injury <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> or worsen. Light exercise on soft ground is best for a horse with splints, as work can help encourage the needed bone growth to heal the splint. Those trainers concerned with the cosmetic appearance of their horse usually prefer to hand-walk twice daily and keep the animal stalled until the splint is resolved, eliminating the chance that the splint will accidentally be knocked during work and the swelling increased.|$|E
25|$|The warming {{environment}} presents {{challenges to}} local communities {{such as the}} Inuit. Hunting, which is a major way of survival for some small communities, will be changed with increasing temperatures. The reduction of sea ice will cause certain species populations to decline or even become extinct. In good years, some communities are fully employed by the commercial harvest of certain animals. The harvest of different animals fluctuates each year and {{with the rise of}} temperatures it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> changing and creating issues for Inuit hunters. Unsuspected changes in river and snow conditions will cause herds of animals, including reindeer, to change migration patterns, calving grounds, and forage availability.|$|E
25|$|Cetacean bycatch is {{increasing}} in intensity and frequency. This {{is a trend}} that <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> because of increasing human population growth and demand for marine food sources, as well as industrialization of fisheries which are expanding into new areas. These fisheries come into direct and indirect contact with cetaceans. An example of direct contact is the physical contact of cetaceans with fishing nets. Indirect contact is through marine trophic pathways where fisheries are severely reducing fish stocks that cetaceans rely on for food. In some fisheries, cetaceans are captured as bycatch but then retained because of their value as food or bait. In this fashion, cetaceans can become a target of fisheries.|$|E

5|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} of extensive declines in extant populations since the introductions of humans, {{particularly among the}} larger and more specialized lemurs.

500|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, the number of {{recognized}} lemur species has more than tripled according to some experts. [...] In 1994, 32distinct species were named in {{the first edition of}} Conservation International's field guide, Lemurs of Madagascar, and 68were described in the 2nd edition, published in 2006. [...] In December 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and other experts co-wrote an article in the International Journal of Primatology classifying 99species and subspecies. [...] In late 2010, the 3rd edition of Lemurs of Madagascar listed 101taxa. [...] The number of lemur species <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> growing in the coming years, as field studies, cytogenetic and molecular genetic research continues, particularly on cryptic species, such as mouse lemurs, which cannot be distinguished visually.|$|E
500|$|The {{number of}} lemur species <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> {{growing in the}} coming years, as field studies, {{cytogenetic}} and molecular genetic research continues. There is not complete agreement over the latest revisions to lemur taxonomy, with some experts preferring an estimated 50lemur species. [...] The debates are likely to continue, as some scholars label the explosive growth of species numbers as taxonomic inflation. In many cases, classifications will ultimately depend upon which species concept is used. In {{the case of the}} lemurs of Madagascar, which have suffered extensively from deforestation and habitat fragmentation, nearly 25% of all species are either Endangered or Critically Endangered, most have yet to be extensively studied, and nearly all populations are in decline. For these reasons, taxonomists and conservationists favor splitting them into separate species to develop an effective strategy for the conservation of the full range of lemur diversity. Implicitly, this means that full species status will help grant genetically distinct populations added environmental protection.|$|E
500|$|Writing in Conflict Quarterly for The Journal of Conflict Studies, David Charters {{questioned}} why {{the book}} did not present {{more of an}} analysis on the aggregate impact {{of all of the}} disinformation campaigns, before noting such a task would be difficult to assess. The reviewer asked why the book did not fully address questions including, [...] "Did any of the forgeries described have a significant political impact on the intended target, and on U.S. relations with the country concerned, or were they merely of nuisance value?" [...] Conflict Quarterly criticized such absence in the book and identified it as an academic deficiency, writing, [...] "Without answers to questions such as these, it is difficult to accept, at face value, the authors' conclusions." [...] Charters concluded the book was [...] "a useful introduction to a field of knowledge which... <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> to expand in importance for diplomats, the intelligence community, and scholars of international security affairs.|$|E

500|$|Another {{principal}} {{threat to}} the survival of ruffed lemurs is hunting. Local human populations still hunt and trap ruffed lemurs with traditional weapons, using them as a source of subsistence. Studies from villages in the Makira Forest have revealed that ruffed lemur meat is not only a desired food, but is being hunted unsustainably. On the Masoala peninsula, the calls of red ruffed lemurs help hunters locate them. On this peninsula, firearms are used in addition to traditional traps, known as laly, which involve a [...] strip of cleared forest with snares set on the few remaining branches that allow the lemurs to cross. Although hunting is illegal, the laws are generally not enforced and the local inhabitants show little concern about their hunting practices, which occur mostly from May to September. Hunting is the biggest concern in the Masoala peninsula because it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue,</b> whereas logging and slash-and-burn agriculture could be curtailed. In other regions, hunters can scare away ruffed lemurs from their favorite food sources, even if they are hunting other prey. Lastly, these animals are taken from their natural habitats to display for tourists or are sold as exotic pets.|$|E
2500|$|Environment Minister Marian Hobbs said in 2003 [...] "...the growth we have must be {{sustained}} {{over a number}} of generations.

2500|$|Within the province, various Regional Districts and {{municipalities}} have enacted laws to control pollution. There are also area-based plans to manage pollution along geographic lines that recognize airsheds instead of political boundaries. This system is especially relevant to BC {{because of its}} mountainous topography.

2500|$|An {{analysis}} of flower traits and visitation in 49 {{species in the}} plant genus Penstemon {{found that it was}} possible to separate bird- and bee- pollinated species quite well, but only by using floral traits which were not considered in the classical accounts of syndromes, such as the details of anther opening. Although a recent review concluded that there is [...] "overwhelming evidence that functional groups exert different selection pressures on floral traits", the sheer complexity and subtlety of plant-pollinator interactions (and the growing recognition that non-pollinating organisms such as seed predators can affect the evolution of flower traits) means that this debate <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> for some time.|$|E
2500|$|As {{captain of}} HMS Manchester Captain Packer was {{involved}} in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. On 27 November 1940 the 18th.

[...] Captain Packer, an aggressive commander, suggested in his report that the Admiralty [...] "stow more ammunition for the forward turrets, possibly {{at the expense of the}} after turrets" [...] as it was [...] "an experience common to many, if not all, of H.M. ships in action, both in this war and the last, and I am willing to prophesy that it is a situation that <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue,</b> that the foremost turrets fired many more rounds than the after turrets".|$|E
2500|$|While it is {{difficult}} to measure exactly how much land has been transformed by human use, estimates range from 39 to 50%. [...] This includes agricultural land, pastureland, urban areas, and heavily harvested forest systems. An estimated 50% of arable land is already under cultivation. Land transformation has increased rapidly over the last fifty years, and <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> to increase. Beyond direct transformation of land area, humans have impacted the global biogeochemical cycles, leading to human caused change in even the most remote areas. These include addition of nutrients such nitrogen and phosphorus, acid rain, ocean acidification, redistribution of water resources, and increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Humans have also changed species compositions of many landscapes that they do not dominate directly by introducing new species or harvesting native species. This new assemblage of species has been compared to previous mass extinctions and speciation events caused by formation of land bridges and colliding of continents.|$|E
