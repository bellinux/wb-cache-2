40|$|Abstract: As modern systems become {{increasingly}} complex, {{there is a}} growing need to support the systems engineering process with a variety of formal models, such that the team of experts involved in the process can express and share knowl-edge precisely, succinctly and unambiguously. However, creating such formal mod-els can be expensive and time-consuming, making a broad exploration of differ-ent system architectures cost-prohibitive. In this paper, we investigate an approach for reducing such costs and hence enabling broader architecture space exploration-through the use of model transformations. Specifically, a method is presented for verifying design alternatives with respect to design requirements through automated <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> <b>analyses</b> from formal models of the systems engineering problem. Formal models are used to express the structure of design alternatives, the system requirements, and experiments to verify the requirements as well as the relation-ships between the models. These formal models are all represented in a common modeling language, the Object Management Group’s Systems Modeling Language (OMG SysMLTM). To then translate descriptive models of system alternatives int...|$|E

In order to deal with ambiguity, the MORphological PArser MORPA is provided with a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG), i. e. it combines a "conventional" context-free morphological grammar to filter out ungrammatical segmentations with a probability-based scoring function which determines the likelihood of each success- ful parse.

40|$|Gene {{circuits}} are dynamical {{systems that}} regulate cellular behaviors, often using protein signals as inputs and outputs. Here {{we have developed}} an optogenetic ‘function generator’ for programming tailor-made gene expression signals in live E. coli. We designed light sequences with experimentally calibrated models of light-switchable two-component systems and used them to drive intracellular protein levels to match user-defined reference time-courses. This approach enabled <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> accelerated and linearized dynamics, sinusoidal oscillations with desired amplitudes and periods, and a complex waveform, all with unprecedented accuracy and precision. We also combined the function generator with a dual fluorescent protein reporter system, analogous to a dual-channel oscilloscope, to reveal that a synthetic repressible promoter linearly transforms repressor signals with an approximate 7 -min delay. Our approach will enable a new <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> dynamic <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> synthetic and natural gene circuits, providing an essential step toward the predictive design and rigorous understanding of biological systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{evolution}} of the petroleum systems in the Tampen Spur area, with main focus on the filling directions of {{the northern part of}} Snorre field, was addressed through 2 D basin modelling (Petromod V. 4. 5 and 7. 0). The geochemical classification of the petroleum popu-lations in the area represented the framework for considering the different kitchen areas and migration systems. Results from the basin modelling support, in general terms, the previous geochemical classification and petroleum families in the region. However, a separate well-defined main kitchen area for the Snorre Field was deduced opposed to the multiple kitchen areas having contributed to the filling as proposed in the literature. Our conclusions are based on the quantitative evaluation of the different proposed kitchen areas and the timing and extent <b>of</b> petroleum <b>generation.</b> Modelling <b>of</b> petroleum <b>generation</b> was performed using asphaltene kinetics determined on petroleum asphaltenes from Snorre oils.

40|$|Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is {{more energy}} {{efficient}} than separate <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> electricity and thermal energy.

40|$|A new Compact Neutral Particle Analyzer (CNPA) [1] {{has been}} {{developed}} at A. F. Ioffe Physical-Technical Institute. The CNPA is an energy and mass spectrometer of reduced size (169302326 mm). It is designed for the simultaneous analysis of H 0 (0. 8 - 80 keV) and D 0 (0. 66 - 36 keV) fluxes emitted by plasma. Significant reduction of spectrometer size and weight (42. 5 kg) is achieved by two innovations: 1) employing of stripping in a thin (100 Å) diamond-like carbon foil instead of the traditional stripping in gas; 2) using a high-field-strength (1 T) NdFeB permanent magnets instead of the traditional electromagnets for <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>analysing</b> magnetic field. An acceleration of particles scattered in the stripping foil is employed in the CNPA, which together with a magnetic field configuration providing two-coordinate focusing is used to achieve a better detection efficiency. The CNPA has the following significant advantages in comparison with conventional NPAs: 1) The compact spectrometer can be installed practically at any position around plasma machine.

40|$|During {{forebrain}} development, radial glia generate neurons {{through the}} production of intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs). The production of IPCs is a central tenet underlying the <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> the appropriate number of cortical neurons, but the transcriptional logic underpinning this process remains poorly defined. Here, we examined IPC production using mice lacking the transcription factor nuclear factor I/X (Nfix). We show that Nfix deficiency delays IPC production and prolongs the neurogenic window, resulting in an increased number of neurons in the postnatal forebrain. Loss of additional Nfi alleles (Nfib) resulted in a severe delay in IPC generation while, conversely, overexpression of NFIX led to precocious IPC <b>generation.</b> Mechanistically, <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> microarray and ChIP-seq datasets, coupled with the investigation of spindle orientation during radial glial cell division, revealed that NFIX promotes the <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> IPCs via the transcriptional upregulation of inscuteable (Insc).

Data came from the Longitudinal Study <b>of</b> <b>Generations.</b> <b>Analyses</b> were based on 5 assessments across a 12 -year period of a sample of 1, 824 individuals ages 16 to 97 years. First, growth curve analyses indicated that self-esteem increases from adolescence to middle adulthood, reaches a peak at about age 50 years, and then decreases in old age. Second, cross-lagged regression analyses indicated that self-esteem is best modeled as a cause rather than a consequence of life outcomes. Third, growth curve analyses, with self-esteem as a time-varying covariate, suggested that self-esteem has medium-sized effects on life-span trajectories of affect and depression, small to medium-sized effects on trajectories of relationship and job satisfaction, a very small effect on the trajectory of health, and {{no effect on the}} trajectory of occupational status. These findings replicated across 4 <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> participants— children, parents, grandparents, and their great-grandparents.
