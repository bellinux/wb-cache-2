40|$|BACKGROUND - Squamous cell carcinomas of {{the skin}} of the bead are better treated with Mobs {{micrographic}} surgery which has the lowest recurrence rates and allows spare normal tissue. There are some characteristics of squamous cell carcinoma that can be related to a <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> surgical stages. OBJECTIVE - To study characteristic of head squamous cell carcinoma that predicts a <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Mohs surgical stages. METHODS - A retrospective analysis of 51 squamous cell carcinomas of the bead treated with Mobs surgery was performed to determine risk factors for a <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> surgical stages. The characteristics analyzed were clinical limits, morphology, recurrence, histological differentiation and size and compared to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> surgical stages. The analysis was performed by Fisher`s exact test and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS - The recurrent squamous cell carcinomas showed a tendency for a <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> stages (p= 0, 081). The Odds Ratio for a <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Mobs stages was three for inaccurate limits; although not statistically significant, it corroborates clinical and previous publication. CONCLUSION - Clinical characteristics of squamous cell carcinoma as recurrence and inaccurate limits would not predict, but could indicate tendency <b>of</b> a <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Mobs micrographic surgery stages...|$|R
