5|$|The {{radiation}} {{amplified by}} hydroxyl masers is the radio continuum of its host. This continuum is primarily composed of synchrotron radiation produced by Type II supernovae. Amplification of this background is low, with amplification factors, or <b>gains,</b> {{ranging from a}} few percent to a few hundred percent, and sources with larger hyperfine ratios typically exhibiting larger <b>gains.</b> Sources with higher <b>gains</b> typically have narrower emission lines. This is expected if the pre-gain linewidths are all roughly the same, as line centers are amplified more than the wings, leading to line narrowing.|$|E

40|$|Q: What the {{difference}} between noise <b>gain</b> and signal <b>gain?</b> A: In the closing of RAQ 56, Amplifier, attenuator or both?, I indicated that you can force the noise <b>gain</b> (NG) while maintaining the signal <b>gain.</b> In a brief recap from op amp theory, two types of <b>gain</b> are associated with op amps: signal <b>gain</b> and noise <b>gain.</b> The signal <b>gain</b> {{is dependent on the}} amplifier configuration. With noninverting op amp configurations, the <b>gain</b> equation is G = (RF /RG) + 1; with inverting configurations, the <b>gain</b> is G = – RF/RG. The noise <b>gain</b> for both of these configurations is the same, and follows the same equation as the noninverting gain: NG = (RF /RG) + 1. The amplifier’s stability in a circuit is determined by the noise <b>gain,</b> not the signal <b>gain.</b> Most modern op amps are stable at unity <b>gain,</b> but some special-purpose amplifiers are not. Decompensated op amps can offer unique advantages, such as lower noise voltage and wider bandwidth, as compared to standard unity-gain stable op amps. So, in what situations would you need to manipulate the noise <b>gain?</b> Forcing the noise <b>gain</b> can help in a variety of applications. For example, to take advantage of one or more of its features, you may want to use a decompensated amplifier below its minimum stable <b>gain.</b> Normally it wouldn’t work, but if you manipulate the noise <b>gain,</b> you can “trick ” the amplifier int...|$|R
