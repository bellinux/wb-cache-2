5|$|The {{keys are}} a {{transitional}} area capable of hosting unexpected birds, often Caribbean species that have strayed near the mainland. The {{interior of the}} keys are frequented by warblers and the hawks that prey on them. Coastal zones are habitat for ruddy turnstones and least sandpipers. <b>Gulls</b> <b>and</b> <b>terns</b> include royal terns, laughing gulls and ring-billed gulls, with brown pelicans just offshore. Wilson's plovers nest on Boca Chita Key, where nesting zones are closed during breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Gulls are {{typically}} medium to large birds, usually grey or white, often with black markings {{on the head}} or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. The large species take up to four years to attain full adult plumage, but two years is typical for small gulls. In Tasmania, three species have been recorded. Terns are in general medium-to-large birds, typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. They have longish bills and webbed feet. They are lighter-bodied and more streamlined than gulls and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. In Tasmania, thirteen species of <b>gulls</b> <b>and</b> <b>terns</b> have been recorded, five of which are vagrants. The two groups have been considered separate families, but some findings that the noddies and white tern are offshoots to the combined group have led the two to be classified as a single family for the time being.|$|E

Freshwater ducks inhabit South Georgia and the Kerguelen Islands.|$|E
25|$|The auks are {{a family}} of seabirds related to the <b>gulls</b> <b>and</b> <b>terns</b> which {{contains}} several genera.

These species, together with the razorbill, little auk and the extinct great auk make up the tribe Alcini. This arrangement was originally based on analyses of auk morphology and ecology.|$|E

500|$|Chapter 11 argues (in a {{way that}} was heavily criticised when the book appeared, see below) that water birds, some of them highly {{conspicuous}} like the jacana and notoriously the male wood duck, are colored for camouflage: [...] "The beautifully contrasted black-and-white bars on the flanks of the Wood Duck (Aix sponsa) are ripple pictures, and as potent , in their place, as the most elaborate markings of land birds". Chapter 12 argues that the [...] "pure white" [...] of ocean birds such as <b>gulls</b> <b>and</b> <b>terns</b> equally functions as camouflage. Thayer admits that these often appear conspicuous, but argues that against varied backgrounds, white offers [...] "the greatest average inconspicuousness against the ocean" [...] (his italics) or against the bright sky when seen from below.|$|E
500|$|Over 200 {{species of}} animals inhabit {{the river and}} its tributaries. Birds such as loons, grebes, ducks, kingfishers, and bald eagles are known to live around streams and {{other regions of the}} watershed. Auks, <b>gulls,</b> <b>and</b> <b>terns</b> have been spotted around the river's mouth, and black-legged kittiwakes nest in the area during the winter. The {{wildlife}} in the Kalmiopsis region of the Chetco watershed is more diverse than that of any other region in Oregon. Mammals such as American black bears, black-tailed deer, bobcats, ring-tailed cats, and gray foxes are common inhabitants of this region. The rare Siskiyou chipmunk is endemic to the Klamath Mountains. Steelhead and chinook and coho salmon are the most common anadromous fish that inhabit the Chetco River. Steelhead are abundant and have been spotted in most major and minor streams. Chinook salmon usually travel as far as Boulder Creek, about halfway between the Chetco's headwaters and its mouth. Coho also generally stay in this area, but some have been found in the Granite and Carter Creek area, about [...] above Boulder Creek. Coastal cutthroat trout can be found all around the watershed; some migrate to the ocean, while others live in the river and its tributaries year round. Pacific lamprey, three-spined stickleback, and various sculpins have also been observed.|$|E

The direct benefits hypothesis (where the female obtains some immediate benefit for copulating with the male, food in this case) may explain why courtship feeding has evolved; however, this theory has recently been disputed with the suggestion that the rate of courtship feeding is a way for females to determine the quality of their mate through the handicap principle.|$|R

6000|$|Near sunset {{the wind}} came on to blow freshly, and we cast anchor {{together}} with the Persian pilgrims upon a rock. This {{was one of the}} celebrated coral reefs of the Red Sea, and the sight justified Forskal's emphatic description-luxus lususque naturae. It was a huge ledge or platform rising but little above the level of the deep; the water-side was perpendicular as the wall of a fort; and, whilst a frigate might have floated within a yard of it, every ripple dashed over the reef, replenishing the little basins and hollows in the surface. The colour of the waves near it was a vivid amethyst. In the distance the eye rested upon what appeared to be meadows of brilliant flowers resembling those of earth, only far brighter and more lovely. Nor was this Land of the Sea wholly desolate. <b>Gulls</b> <b>and</b> <b>terns</b> here swam the tide; there, seated upon the coral, devoured their prey.

60|$|Shoals {{of small}} goggled-eyed fish are seen, that spring clear {{out of the}} water; and are preyed upon by terns and other birds; a few insects skim the surface; turtle and {{porpoises}} tumble along, all forming a very busy contrast to the lazy alligator, sunning his green and scaly back near the shore, with his ichthyosaurian snout raised high above the water. Birds are numerous, especially early and late in the day. Along the silent shore the hungry Pariah dog may be seen tearing his meal from some stranded corpse, whilst the adjutant-bird, with his head sunk on his body and one leg tucked up, patiently awaits his turn. At night the beautiful Brahminee geese alight, one by one, and seek total solitude; ever since having disturbed a god in his slumbers, these birds are fated to pass the night in single blessedness. The <b>gulls</b> <b>and</b> <b>terns,</b> again, roost in flocks, as do the wild geese and pelicans,--the latter, however, not till after making a hearty and very noisy supper. These birds congregate by the sides of pools, and beat the water with violence, so as to scare the fish, which thus become an easy prey; a fact which was, I believe, first indicated by Pallas, during his residence {{on the banks of}} the Caspian Sea. Shells are scarce, and consist of a few small bivalves; their comparative absence is probably due to the paucity of limestone in the mountains whence the many feeders flow. The sand is pure white and small-grained, with fragments of hornblende and mica, the latter varying in abundance as a feeder is near or far away. Pink sand* [I have seen the same garnet sand covering the bottom of the Himalayan torrents, where it is the produce of disintegrated gneiss, and whence it is transported to the Ganges.] of garnets is very common, and deposited in layers interstratified with the white quartz sand. Worm-marks, ripple-marks, and the footsteps of alligators, birds and beasts, abound in the wet sand. The vegetation of the banks consists of annuals which find no permanent resting-place. Along the sandy shores the ever-present plants are mostly English, as Dock, a Nasturtium, Ranunculus sceleratus, Fumitory, Juncus bufonius,, Common Vervain, Gnaphalium luteo-album, and very frequently Veronica Anagallise. On the alluvium grow the same, mixed with Tamarisk, Acacia Arabica, and a few other bushes.|$|E
