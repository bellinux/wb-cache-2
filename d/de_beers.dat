5|$|The <b>De</b> <b>Beers</b> company, as the world's largest diamond mining company, holds a {{dominant}} {{position in the}} industry, and has done so since soon after its founding in 1888 by the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes. <b>De</b> <b>Beers</b> is currently the world's largest operator of diamond production facilities (mines) and distribution channels for gem-quality diamonds. The Diamond Trading Company (DTC) is a subsidiary of <b>De</b> <b>Beers</b> and markets rough diamonds from De Beers-operated mines. <b>De</b> <b>Beers</b> and its subsidiaries own mines that produce some 40% of annual world diamond production. For most of the 20th century over 80% of the world's rough diamonds passed through <b>De</b> <b>Beers,</b> but by 2001–2009 the figure had decreased to around 45%, and by 2013 the company's market share had further decreased to around 38% in value terms and even less by volume. <b>De</b> <b>Beers</b> sold off {{the vast majority of}} its diamond stockpile in the late 1990s – early 2000s and the remainder largely represents working stock (diamonds that are being sorted before sale). This was well documented in the press but remains little known to the general public.|$|E

5|$|UNITA's {{ability to}} mine {{diamonds}} {{and sell them}} abroad provided funding for the war to continue even as the movement's support in the Western world and among the local populace withered away. <b>De</b> <b>Beers</b> and Endiama, a state-owned diamond-mining monopoly, signed a contract allowing <b>De</b> <b>Beers</b> to handle Angola's diamond exports in 1990. According to the United Nation's Fowler Report, Joe De Deker, a former stockholder in <b>De</b> <b>Beers,</b> worked {{with the government of}} Zaire to supply military equipment to UNITA from 1993 to 1997. De Deker's brother, Ronnie, allegedly flew from South Africa to Angola, directing weapons originating in Eastern Europe. In return, UNITA gave Ronnie bushels of diamonds worth $6million. De Deker sent the diamonds to De Beer's buying office in Antwerp, Belgium. <b>De</b> <b>Beers</b> openly acknowledges spending $500million on legal and illegal Angolan diamonds in 1992 alone. The United Nations estimates Angolans made between three and four billion dollars through the diamond trade between 1992 and 1998. The UN also estimates that out of that sum, UNITA made at least $3.72billion, or 93% of all diamond sales, despite international sanctions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOphiostoma {{species have}} diverse {{morphological}} features and {{are found in}} a large variety of ecological niches. Many different classification schemes have been applied to these fungi in the past based on teleomorph and anamorph features. More recently, studies based on DNA sequence comparisions have shown that Ophiostoma consists of different phylogenetic groups, but the data have not been sufficient to define clear monophyletic lineages represented by practical taxonomic units. We used DNA sequence data from combined partial nuclear LSU and β-tubulin genes to consider the phylogenetic relationships of 50 Ophiostoma species, representing all the major morphological groups in the genus. Our data showed three well-supported, monophyletic lineages in Ophiostoma. Species with Leptographium anamorphs grouped together and to accommodate these species the teleomorph-genus Grosmannia (type species G. penicillata), including 27 species and 24 new combinations, is re-instated. Another well-defined lineage includes species that are cycloheximide-sensitive with short perithecial necks, falcate ascospores and Hyalorhinocladiella anamorphs. For these species, the teleomorph-genus Ceratocystiopsis (type species O. minuta), including 11 species and three new combinations, is re-instated. A third group of species with either Sporothrix or Pesotum anamorphs includes species from various ecological niches such as Protea infructescences in South Africa. This group also includes O. piliferum, the type species of Ophiostoma, and these species are retained in that genus. Ophiostoma is redefined to reflect the changes resulting from new combinations in Grosmannia and Ceratocystiopsis. Our data have revealed additional lineages in Ophiostoma linked to morphological characters. However, these species are retained in Ophiostoma until further data for {{a larger number of}} species can be obtained to confirm monophyly of the apparent lineages.

5|$|Fleming became {{interested}} in diamond smuggling after reading an article in The Sunday Times in 1954 concerning the Sierra Leone diamond industry. Philip Brownrigg, an old friend from Eton and a senior exec of <b>De</b> <b>Beers,</b> arranged for Fleming to visit the London Diamond Club to see diamonds being sorted and polished. In 1955 Brownrigg also introduced Fleming to Sir Percy Sillitoe, former head of MI5, who was working for <b>De</b> <b>Beers</b> and investigating the illicit diamond trade through the International Diamond Security Organisation. Fleming met Sillitoe and used {{much of the research}} as background material for his fictional Bond novel, Diamonds Are Forever.|$|E
5|$|When the {{drafts of}} the books were shown to <b>De</b> <b>Beers</b> they objected {{to a number of}} areas and {{threatened}} an injunction against Fleming and The Sunday Times, which resulted in much material being removed.

This, <b>de</b> <b>Beer</b> argued, could cause apparently sudden changes in the fossil record, since embryos fossilise poorly.

5|$|The Diamond Smugglers is a non-fiction work by Ian Fleming {{that was}} first {{published}} in 1957 in the United Kingdom and in 1958 in the United States. The book is based on two weeks of interviews Fleming undertook with John Collard, a member of the International Diamond Security Organisation (IDSO), which was headed by Sir Percy Sillitoe, the ex-chief of MI5 who worked exclusively for the diamond company <b>De</b> <b>Beers.</b>|$|E
5|$|By mid 1954 {{the author}} Ian Fleming had {{published}} two novels—Casino Royale (1953) and Live and Let Die (1954)—and had a third, Moonraker, being edited {{and prepared for}} production. That year he read a story in The Sunday Times about diamond smuggling from Sierra Leone. He considered this story as the possible basis for a new novel and, through an old school friend, he engineered a meeting with Sir Percy Sillitoe, the ex-head of MI5, then working in a security capacity for the diamond-trading company <b>De</b> <b>Beers.</b> The material Fleming gathered was used in both Diamonds Are Forever and The Diamond Smugglers, a non-fiction book published in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Collard relates {{how he was}} {{recruited}} into the IDSO by Sir Percy Sillitoe, the ex-head of MI5, under whom Collard had worked.

Collard explained that the IDSO was set up at the instigation of the Chairman of <b>De</b> <b>Beers,</b> Sir Philip Oppenheimer, after an Interpol report stated that £10 million of diamonds were being smuggled out of South Africa each year, as well as additional amounts from Sierra Leone, Portuguese West Africa, the Gold Coast and Tanganyika.|$|E

5|$|Several {{methods for}} {{identifying}} synthetic diamonds can be performed, {{depending on the}} method of production {{and the color of}} the diamond.

Stones in the D-Z color range can be examined through the DiamondSure UV/visible spectrometer, a tool developed by <b>De</b> <b>Beers.</b> Similarly, natural diamonds usually have minor imperfections and flaws, such as inclusions of foreign material, that are not seen in synthetic diamonds.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes outmanoeuvred {{his main}} {{opponent}} Barney Barnato and brought all the mines {{under the control}} of his company, <b>De</b> <b>Beers,</b> in 1888. On 30 October of that year, through the signing of the Rudd Concession by King Lobengula of Matabeleland, he obtained exclusive mining rights across all of Lobengula's territories in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and beyond for his soon-to-be-formed British South Africa Company (BSAC). Queen Victoria granted the BSAC a royal charter to administer and develop these territories on 29 October 1889, for an initial period of 25 years. This charter included the right to take possession of, deal with, and dispose of land. On 12 September 1890 Rhodes's Pioneer Column reached what was to become Salisbury.|$|E
5|$|At the 1920 elections, {{domestic}} interests aligned {{against those}} of the BSAC, rather than unreservedly in favour of responsible government. The run up to the 1922 referendum was long and acrimonious. For the Union were most of the leading citizens of Salisbury and Bulawayo, the British, South African and Rhodesian presses, the BSAC, and the British government. Against them was the Responsible Government Association, founded in 1917 by Ethel Tawse Jollie. Wallis, in his biography of Coghlan, One Man's Hand, gives him {{the credit for the}} victory of the responsible government lobby. Lewis Hastings, reviewing Wallis's book, recalls campaigning with Coghlan and says that he was the undisputed leader of the movement—highly competent, with a clear vision, principled and sincere. He attributes Coghlan's resolve to his years in Kimberley, where he experienced the autocratic rule of the <b>De</b> <b>Beers</b> mining company, owned by the BSAC.|$|E

30|$|The internationally severe {{recession}} {{starting in}} 2008 – 2009 has spawned {{research on the}} consequences in terms of poverty and inequality (e.g. <b>De</b> <b>Beer</b> 2012; Smeeding et al. 2011; Jenkins et al. 2012). Recessions can generally be expected to suppress real incomes and increase poverty measured using a fixed poverty line, while effects on inequality and relative income poverty are more ambiguous, both theoretically and empirically (Jenkins et al 2012; <b>De</b> <b>Beer</b> 2012). While some results suggest that also inequality increases during downturns (Parker 1998; <b>De</b> <b>Beer</b> 2012), studies focussed on the 2008 – 2009 recession suggest that this economic downturn only had modest effects on inequality {{in the case of}} the USA (Grusky et al. 2011) and heterogeneous effects across countries (<b>De</b> <b>Beer</b> 2012; Jenkins et al. 2012).|$|R

Although details are unknown, <b>De</b> <b>Beers</b> and other diamond industry players speculate that mine performance deteriorated significantly in the 1980s under government management. Suspected causes of this are a decrease in ore grade as the mine's richer deposits were worked out, loss of skilled foreign management and engineering staff, a bloated labor force resulting from government employment efforts, and inadequate capital investment in the mine's equipment. Perhaps {{as a result of}} this poor performance, Tanzania invited <b>De</b> <b>Beers</b> to purchase back into the mine, which the company did.
