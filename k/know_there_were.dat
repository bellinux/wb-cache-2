AD 100 at about 50,000, less than 3% of the total provincial population of c. 1.7 million. In the empire as a whole, we <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> just over 6 million Roman citizens in AD 47, the last quinquennial Roman census return extant. This was just 9% of a total imperial population generally estimated at c. 70 million at that time.|$|E
25|$|On November 16, during Week 11, a {{game between}} the Philadelphia Eagles and the Cincinnati Bengals at Paul Brown Stadium ended in a 13–13 tie, the first NFL tie game since November 10, 2002, when the Atlanta Falcons and the Pittsburgh Steelers ended in a 34–34 draw. After the game, Donovan McNabb {{mentioned}} {{that he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> ties in the NFL, apparently confusing the NFL's postseason rules (where teams can and have played double overtime games because those contests continue until a team finally wins) with the regular season rules. This drew the ire of many fans, who thought that a quarterback of his caliber should know some fundamental rules; however, none of McNabb's critics accused him of not playing to win during the OT period in Cincinnati, and his play was tied into a game that was widely derided as one of the ugliest, most disjointed results in NFL history.|$|E

I <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> discussions" [...] {{and goes on to}} say [...] "The offer to Chuck was that it was only to replace financial considerations he might lose due to an election". Harper also stated that he had told the Conservative party representatives that they were unlikely to succeed. [...] "I told them they were wasting their time. I said Chuck had made up his mind." [...] In February 2008, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigated the allegations that Section 119's provisions on bribery and corruption in the Criminal Code had been violated. The RCMP concluded their investigation stating that there was no evidence for pressing charges.|$|E

Travolta responded a week later to the awards: [...] "I didn't even <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> such awards. I have people around me {{whose job it is}} to not tell me about such things. They're obviously doing their job. Not every film can be a critical and box office success. It would have been awful only if Battlefield Earth was neither. That's not the case. It is edging toward the $100m mark which means it has found an audience even if it didn't impress critics. I'd rather my films connect with audiences than with critics because it gives you more longevity as a performer." [...] He later insisted that he still felt [...] "really good about it.

2500|$|In 1954, J. Robert Oppenheimer {{was labeled}} a {{hydrogen}} bomb opponent. The public did not <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> {{two kinds of}} hydrogen bomb (neither of which is accurately described as a hydrogen bomb). On May 23, when his security clearance was revoked, item {{three of the four}} public findings against him was [...] "his conduct in the hydrogen bomb program." [...] In 1949, Oppenheimer had supported single-stage fusion-boosted fission bombs, to maximize the explosive power of the arsenal given the trade-off between plutonium and tritium production. He opposed two-stage thermonuclear bombs until 1951, when radiation implosion, which he called [...] "technically sweet", first made them practical. The complexity of his position was not revealed to the public until 1976, nine years after his death.|$|E
2500|$|Hephaestion {{was given}} a {{magnificent}} funeral. Its cost is variously given in the sources as 10,000 talents or 12,000 talents. It is difficult to give a modern equivalent for such a huge amount {{but we know that}} in Hephaestion’s time, the daily wage of a skilled worker was two or three drachmas. In western Europe, 2008, that would be between £50 and £100, so the lowest possible value for 1 drachma in modern terms is £25. We <b>know</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> 6,000 drachmas in a talent, so even at the most conservative estimate, Hephaestion’s funeral would have cost £1,500,000,000. Alexander himself drove the funeral carriage part of the way back to Babylon with some of the driving entrusted to Hephaestion's friend Perdiccas. At Babylon funeral games were held in Hephaestion's honour. The contests ranged from literature to athletics and 3,000 competitors took part, the festival eclipsing anything that had gone before both in cost and in numbers taking part. Plutarch says that Alexander planned to spend ten thousand talents on the funeral and the tomb. He employed Stasicrates, [...] "...as this artist was famous for his innovations, which combined an exceptional degree of magnificence, audacity and ostentation...", to design the pyre for Hephaestion.|$|E
