We then apply to their colors a gamut expansion that increases both their chroma and their lightness towards the colors located at the boundary of the gamut formed by the combination of classical and fluorescent inks. This expansion can be controlled by user-defined parameters. We create smooth chroma transitions between the expanded and nonexpanded image parts. We also preview the printable gamut expanded image generated according to user-defined gamut expansion parameters.

40|$|In {{designing}} print ads, one of {{the decisions}} the advertiser must make is which color(s) to use as executional cues in the ad. Typically, color decisions are based on intuition and anecdotal evidence. To provide guidelines for these decisions, this research proposes and tests a conceptual framework linking the hue, chroma, and value of the color(s) in an ad to consumers' feelings and attitudes. In an experimental study, the three dimensions of color used in an ad are manipulated using a between-subjects design. The results support the hypotheses that ads containing colors with {{a higher level of}} value lead to greater liking for the ad, and this effect is mediated by the greater feelings of relaxation elicited by the higher value color. Feelings play an equally important role in the effect of chroma. Consistent with the hypotheses, <b>higher</b> levels of <b>chroma</b> elicit greater feelings of excitement, which in turn increase ad likeability. A follow-up study found that although managers often select higher value and <b>higher</b> <b>chroma</b> <b>colors,</b> in a large number of cases they do not.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The morphology, mineralogy, and stratigraphic {{and lateral}} {{distribution}} of paleosols in Pennsylvanian (Moscovian–Gzhelian; Atokan–Virgilian) mixed marine and terrestrial coal-bearing strata (i. e., cyclothems) in the Illinois basin (IB) {{are presented in}} order to determine the dominant pedogenic processes within a cyclic sedimentary depositional framework. Paleosol morphologies range from weakly developed horizons with evidence of rooting and little to no pedogenic structure, to horizons with well-developed pedogenic slickensides, angular blocky structure, and carbonate nodules and tubules. The majority of paleosols in strata from the basin interior preserve (1) low <b>chroma</b> (gley) <b>colors,</b> (2) identifiable fossil plant organic matter that increases in abundance upward in the profiles toward the interpreted paleo-surface, and (3) calcite, sphaerosiderite, and pyrite cements and nodules. In contrast, paleosols in strata from the northern margin of the basin display <b>high</b> <b>chroma</b> <b>colors</b> and calcite cements and less fossil organic matter, sphaerosiderite, and pyrite cements. These observations indicate that paleosols from the basin interior underwent a multi-phase pedogenic and shallow burial history characterized by an initial better-drained, oxygenated stage under seasonal precipitation, followed by a poorly drained, reducing stage, while paleosols from the northern margin of the basin experienced overall more oxygenated conditions throughout their pedogenic development. X-ray diffraction analysis of the, 2 mm size fraction of paleosol matrix in IB paleosols indicates a mineralogical composition dominated by kaolinite, randomly interstratified (R 0) and ordered (R 1) illite–smectite (I/S), and subordinate amounts of chlorite. These combined observational and mineralogical datasets indicate that significant changes i...|$|R

40|$|Solid {{solutions}} of Ni in MgTiO 3 ilmenite (geikielite) {{were investigated}} as potential yellowish ceramic pigments or dyes. Ni-geikielite samples (Mg 1 −xNixTiO 3, x = 0 – 0. 4) were prepared by solid-state and citrate-gel routes and fired pigments {{were characterized by}} XRD, SEM/EDX, UV–vis–NIR and color measurement techniques. The increase of Ni-doping enhanced ilmenite stabilization in ceramic samples, obtaining almost single phase of Ni-geikielite for x = 0. 4 at 1200 and 1400 °C. Fired pigments exhibited intense yellow colors at both temperatures, associated to Ni 2 + ions in distorted octahedral A sites of ATiO 3 ilmenite, and an increase of the orange hue with firing temperature arising from an enhanced (Mg,Ni) O 6 polyhedral distortion. Noteworthy, citrate-gel samples exhibited a much higher reactivity, yielding well-crystallized Ni-geikielite at lower temperatures (800 °C/ 3 h), and leading to <b>higher</b> <b>chroma</b> yellow-orange <b>colors</b> even at lower Ni loadings. These pigments were partially stable in commercial low-temperature ceramic glazes, giving rise to weaker yellowish colors irrespective of the preparation route.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Aquic conditions are defined in terms of saturation and reduction, but they are often evaluated based on soil redoximorphic features. Interpretations of redoximorphic features are complicated by the presence of relict features in some areas. In this study three Alfisols forming a toposequence in the Claypan Major Land Resource Area were evaluated for redoximorphic features and actual current moisture conditions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the Silawa-Rader-Edge toposequence to determine which redoximorphic fealures in these soils are associated with contemporary aquic conditions and which are relict features. Saturation, matric potential, and redox potential were measured at several depths with piezometers, tensiometers, and permanently installed Eli electrodes. Redoximorphic and other features were described in the field and from thin sections. Supporting laboratory analyses included physical and chemical characterization, x-ray diffraction, and elemental analysis. None of the three soils studied had a Ground water table within 5 meters of the surface. The <b>high</b> <b>chroma</b> <b>colors</b> in Silawa reflected current well drained conditions which were confirmed by field monitoring. The Fe-Mn nodules and concretions in Silawa were relict features either transported with the terrace deposit or formed in place during a previous wetter moisture regime. The low <b>chroma</b> <b>colors</b> and few nodules in Edge were also relict features from previous wetter environments and did not reflect current well drained conditions. in Rader there was a perched water table at I meter for 6 to 7 months each year during the study period. Thus, Rader met the requirements for episaturation. Water also perched above 60 cm for shorter periods immediately following rainfall events. From Eh readings, Rader appeared to have sufficient periods of reduction in some microsites to mobilize Fe. Therefore, redoximorphic features within perched water tables reflected current as well as previous aquic conditions, while features below BC horizon upper boundary, at 153 cm, were relicts. Taxonomic classifications of the three pedons representing Silawa, Rader, and Edge series were evaluated. All three pedons studied had good evidence for argillic horizons, but each pedon had a few characteristics outside the range of the established series taxonomic placement. The Rader site appeared to be borderline between aquic (as classified) and oxyaquic sub-groups. There were significant microsite variations indicated by replicate readinos for piezometers in Rader and tensionieters and Eh electrodes as in all three soils. Replicates often indicated similar trends but different degrees of saturation and reduction. The designation of aquic or oxyaquic subgroup for Rader hinges on whether reduction is required throughout most of the soil mass to meet aquic condition requirements or reduction in only some microsites is sufficient. The aquic conditions section of the most recent Key to taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1992) does not address this issue...|$|R

Three metrics were chosen to quantify SRF heterogeneity, including percent occurrence, mean Euclidean distance, and the Interspersion/Juxtaposition Index. The relative change in these metrics was determined for 16 image sizes ranging from 2. 5 cm 2 to 40 cm 2 and used to identify an REA. Results showed REAs (mean±SE) for Low Chroma (17. 7 cm 2 ± 0. 4) and <b>High</b> <b>Chroma</b> (25. 4 cm 2 ± 0. 7) were significantly different (α= 0. 05).
