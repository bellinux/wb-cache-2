40|$|Abstract. – The {{idea that}} one can build a {{solid-state}} device that lets heat flow more easily in one way than in the other, forming a <b>heat</b> <b>valve,</b> is counter-intuitive. However {{the design of a}} thermal rectifier can be easily understood from the basic laws of heat conduction. Here we show how it can be done. This analysis exhibits several ideas that could in principle be implemented to design a thermal rectifier, by selecting materials with the proper properties. In order to show the feasibility of the concept, we complete this study by introducing a simple model system that meets the requirements of the design. While electronics has been able to control the flow of charges in solids for decades, the control of heat flow still seems out of reach, and this is why, when a paper showed for the first time how to build a “thermal rectifier ” [1], the thermal analogue of the electrical diode, it attracted {{a great deal of attention}} [2]. The idea {{that one can}} build a solid-state device that lets heat flow more easily in one way than in the other, forming a <b>heat</b> <b>valve,</b> is counterintuitive and may even appear in contradiction with thermodynamics.

40|$|Marpol oil waste {{composed}} of wasted oil with seawater which is challenging for waste treatment. Therefore, emulsified seawater {{has to be}} broken down for recovering the oil content involving chemical destabilizer to disperse water droplets or destroy emulsifiers. This study aims to evaluate 37 products of demulsifiers (cationic, non-ionic and anionic) based on ability of water removal from Marpol oil waste. The results show that anionic and nonionic surfactants {{were found to be}} effective demulsifiers exhibiting good property for oil and water separation. The efficiency of the nonionic demulsifiers increases with the dosage up to a certain extent after which the efficiency falls. However, anionic demulsifiers do not show any decrease in efficiency at higher doses. Among all the tested anionic demulsifiers, sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (ALCOPOL O 70 PG), sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (ALCOPOL O CONC 60 %) and Oligoguluronate (DP 9 - 6661) were with most outstanding performance. Additionally there is a general improvement in the performance of screened demulsifiers with increased temperature (70 °C). Sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (ALCOPOL O 70 PG), sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (ALCOPOL O CONC 60 %) and sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate (DP 9 - 6661) reached water removal performance percentage as 75 %, 66. 3 % and 56. 7 % respectively after 30 h.
