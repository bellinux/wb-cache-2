50|$|Because of this, the New Automatic Proofreader was {{introduced}} in February 1986. This version used a more sophisticated checksum algorithm that could catch transposition errors. It also took spacing into account if they were within quotes (where they were generally significant to the program's operation), while ignoring them outside of quotes (where they were not relevant). Also, the <b>decimal</b> <b>display</b> of the checksum was replaced with a hexadecimal value.|$|E

50|$|Octal became {{widely used}} in {{computing}} when systems such as the PDP-8, ICL 1900 and IBM mainframes employed 12-bit, 24-bit or 36-bit words. Octal was an ideal abbreviation of binary for these machines because their word size is divisible by three (each octal digit represents three binary digits). So four, eight or twelve digits could concisely display an entire machine word. It also cut costs by allowing Nixie tubes, seven-segment displays, and calculators {{to be used for}} the operator consoles, where binary displays were too complex to use, <b>decimal</b> <b>displays</b> needed complex hardware to convert radices, and hexadecimal displays needed to display more numerals.|$|R
5000|$|Systems {{based on}} ASCII or a {{compatible}} character set use either [...] (Line feed, , , 10 in decimal) or [...] (Carriage return, , , 13 in <b>decimal,</b> <b>displayed</b> as [...] "^M" [...] in some editors) individually, or [...] followed by [...] (+, , [...] ). These characters {{are based on}} printer commands: The line feed indicated that one line of paper should feed out of the printer thus instructed the printer to advance the paper one line, and a carriage return indicated that the printer carriage should return {{to the beginning of}} the current line. Some rare systems, such as QNX before version 4, used the ASCII [...] (record separator, , 30 in decimal) character as the newline character.|$|R
50|$|The {{calculator}} used {{a traditional}} floating <b>decimal</b> <b>display</b> for numbers {{that could be}} displayed in that format, but automatically switched to scientific notation for other numbers. The fifteen-digit LED display was capable of displaying a ten-digit mantissa plus its sign and a decimal point and a two-digit exponent plus its sign. The display used a unique form of multiplexing, illuminating a single LED segment at a time rather than a single LED digit, because HP research had shown that this method was perceived by the human eye as brighter for equivalent power. Light emitting diodes were relatively new {{at the time and}} were much dimmer than high efficiency diodes developed in subsequent decades.|$|E

50|$|A soccer {{match between}} {{traditional}} rivals Hellas and Juventus {{on the opening}} night of the Show created much interest. Another area of interest was the <b>Decimal</b> Currency Board's <b>display,</b> with the 'Dollar Girls' on hand to explain the new monetary system to be introduced in February 1966.|$|R
5000|$|The display {{has eight}} digits, {{with both a}} minus sign and an {{overflow}} indicator dot on the right hand side. The decimal point is [...] "floating"—it is positioned automatically by the calculator logic. This was an advanced feature for the time; many desk calculators of this era had fixed decimal points and required very wide displays to maintain a minimum level of precision across {{the entire range of}} numbers available. The QT-8D's floating <b>decimal</b> allowed its <b>display</b> to be much narrower while still keeping eight digits of precision.|$|R
5000|$|At 15 digits, {{the display}} was wider {{than those of}} the {{predecessor}} models, although the <b>decimal</b> point was <b>displayed</b> on its own digit position. The HP-67 keys carry up to four functions each, accessed through [...] "f", [...] "g" [...] and [...] "h" [...] prefix keys (gold, blue and black labels, respectively). The model 97 had more (and larger) keys, therefore only two functions were assigned to each key. When interchanging magnetic cards between the HP-67 and the HP-97, the calculators' software took care of converting the key codes, and emulated the 97's print functions through the 67's display.|$|R
40|$|A digital {{frequency}} independent {{phase meter}} is discussed. Wide {{range of operation}} is obtained by transforming the phase to be measured into frequency within a constant range started from zero to 360 Hz. A special Astable multivibrator circuit operating in this frequency range is used with a <b>decimal</b> counter to <b>display</b> the phase reading. The timing capacitor of this circuit is switched using a voltage controlled switch (VCS) operated by the phase pulses, where the free running frequency {{is directly related to}} their duty cycle. The circuit is very simple, its frequency band is wide with low cost compared with conventional circuits used for digital phase measurements. Experimental work perfectly agrees with theoretical analysis. IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United State...|$|R
50|$|ESNs {{are often}} {{represented}} as either 11-digit decimal numbers or 8 digit hexadecimal numbers. For the decimal format {{the first three}} digits are the decimal representation of the first 8 bits (between 000 and 255 inclusive) and the next 8 digits are derived from the remaining 24 bits and will be between 00000000 and 16777215 inclusive. The decimal format of pseudo ESNs will therefore begin with 128. The <b>decimal</b> format separately <b>displays</b> 8 bit manufacturer codes in the first 3 digits, but 14 bit codes are not displayed as separate digits. The hexadecimal format displays an ESN as 8 digits and also does not separately display 14 bit manufacturer codes which occupy 3.5 hexadecimal digits.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental framework {{for assessing the}} biases associated with the interpretation of numbers. This framework consists of having participants convert between different representations of quantities. These representations should include both variations in numerical labels that symbolize quantities and variations in displays in which quantity is inherent. Five experiments assessed how people convert between relative frequencies, <b>decimals,</b> and <b>displays</b> of dots that denote very low proportions (i. e., proportions below 1 %). The participants demonstrated perceptual, response, and numerical transformation biases. Furthermore, the data suggest that relative frequencies and decimals are associated with different abstract representations of amount. Scientists and lay people use several numerical formats (i. e., any symbol system used to represent quantities) to symbolize propor-tions. For example, the decimal “ 0. 5 ” and relative frequency “ 1 in 2 ” symbolize the same proportion. Although relative frequencies and decimals denote proportions equally well, people may inter-pret these numerical formats differently. Nevertheless, researchers often make an implicit assumption that people interpret these numerical formats equivalently (termed the assumption of numer-ical equivalence). The implicit assumption of numerical equiva-lence is prevalent in studies of psychophysics (e. g., Gescheider...|$|R
5000|$|An EMV {{smartcard}} {{contains a}} (typically 16-bit) transaction counter that is incremented with each payment or CAP transaction. The response displayed by a CAP reader essentially {{consists of the}} {{various parts of the}} card's response (Application Transaction Counter, MAC, etc.) which is then reduced to specific bits as determined by the Issuer Authentication Indicator (IAI) record stored in the card (this is set on a per-issuer basis, although should an issuer desire, it could be set randomly for each card providing a database of each card's IAI is kept), finally, after unwanted bits are discarded (essentially the absolute position of bits is irrelevant, a bit in the IAI that is 0 means the corresponding bit in the card response will be dropped rather than merely being set to 0). Finally the value is converted from binary into a <b>decimal</b> number and <b>displayed</b> to the user. A truncated example is provided below: ...|$|R
40|$|We use the decimal code to {{represent}} numbers. Digital electronic circuits in computers and calculators use general the binary code {{to represent}}s numbers. A common task of decoding from machine language to decimal numbers is encoding. A very common output device to <b>display</b> <b>decimal</b> numbers is the seven segment display. In this research paper we have formulated how experiments on 7 -Segment display are performed using {{the concept of}} virtual Intelligent SoftLab (VIS). A 7 -Segment display constructed using the Virtual SoftLab and observed actual outputs. The 10 (ten) digits (0 - 9) are represented by 4 -bit input. VIS helps us to create results using visual display. Software for conducting the experimentations in 7 -Segment display has been developed which helps students to perform and practice the experiments. A 7 -Segment display experiments provides a pictorial method of design and evaluating experiments. In this paper we have designed the software that can observe the results. This will help students in understanding working of 7 -Segment displa...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{power factor}} meter uses {{analogue}} system to read the power factor of an AC electric power system which {{is defined as the}} ratio of the real power to the apparent power. In the modern life, an easy-captured data yet cost effective power factor measurement device is vital in the electrical power engineering studies. The unstable reading of the analogue based {{power factor meter}} especially in the disturbance situations emerged the development of digital based power factor meter (PFM) to replace the conventional electro-dynamic types. The major advantage of using the digital based PFM is the data read by the meter can be stored easily for other applications or studies. This paper presents the development of a cost effective digital PFM which is based on an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) provided with ratiometric facilities. Generally, the digital power factor meter consists of four main parts which are power supply, inputs circuit, signal processing, and the display part. A signal proportional to the peak voltage (Vm) is applied to the reference input voltage of the ADC, while another signal proportional to the product of the peak voltage (Vm) and power factor is applied to the analogue input. Both signals are processed through various operational amplifier based circuits such as averager, zero detector, and differentiator. The developed digital PFM has been tested and performed for single phase laboratory measurements with three <b>decimal</b> digits <b>display</b> on a liquid crystal display (LCD) unit. The results achieved validate the functionality of the developed digital PFM...|$|R
40|$|Background Online risk calculators offer {{different}} levels of precision in their risk estimates. People interpret numbers in varying ways depending on how they are presented, {{and we do not}} know how the number of <b>decimal</b> places <b>displayed</b> might influence perceptions of risk estimates. Objective The objective of our study was to determine whether precision (ie, number of decimals) in risk estimates offered by an online risk calculator influences users’ ratings of (1) how believable the estimate is, (2) risk magnitude (ie, how large or small the risk feels to them), and (3) how well they can recall the risk estimate after a brief delay. Methods We developed two mock risk calculator websites that offered hypothetical percentage estimates of participants’ lifetime risk of kidney cancer. Participants were randomly assigned to a condition where the risk estimate value rose with increasing precision (2, 2. 1, 2. 13, 2. 133) or the risk estimate value fell with increasing precision (2, 1. 9, 1. 87, 1. 867). Within each group, participants were randomly assigned one of the four numbers as their first risk estimate, and later received one of the remaining three as a comparison. Results Participants who completed the experiment (N = 3422) were a demographically diverse online sample, approximately representative of the US adult population on age, gender, and race. Participants whose risk estimates had no decimal places gave the highest ratings of believability (F 3, 3384 = 2. 94, P =. 03) and the lowest ratings of risk magnitude (F 3, 3384 = 4. 70, P =. 003). Compared to estimates with decimal places, integer estimates were judged as highly believable by 7...|$|R
5000|$|With {{one whole}} second showing on the {{official}} clock, Heidemann made two rapid attacks in succession both halted by double-touches. Despite this the clock in the arena continued to show [...] "00:01" [...] (because it could not <b>display</b> <b>decimal</b> fractions of a second). The referee then called [...] "halt" [...] to the bout. At this point, the timekeeper (a Games Volunteer) restarted the clock inadvertently expiring all the remaining time, reportedly 0.02 seconds. This action caused the arena clock to show [...] "00:00" [...] giving Shin reason to celebrate. However the error was noted and since an overtime minute had to be fenced in its entirety, the referee applied FIE rule t.32-3, which states that {{in the event of}} a failure of the clock or an error by the timekeeper, the referee must estimate how much time is left. The timekeeper, with the referee's permission, reset the clock to show [...] "00:01", one whole second being the minimum unit of time possible. Following the resumption of the bout, Heidemann scored a single touch just as the full second expired. The result was partly due to the failure of the referee to stop both fencers restarting closer than the specified distance, Heidemann's [...] "crowding" [...] to hurry her attack, and Shin trying to avoid retreating across her end line.|$|R
50|$|Thus, midnight {{was called}} either dix heures (10 o'clock) or zero heures (0 o'clock), noon was called cinq heures (5 o'clock), etc. Units were either written out or abbreviated, such as 8 h. 72 m. Sometimes in {{official}} records, decimal hours {{were divided into}} tenths, or décimes, instead of minutes. Although clocks and watches were produced with faces showing both standard time with numbers 1-24 and decimal time with numbers 1-10, decimal time never caught on; it was not officially used {{until the beginning of}} the Republican year III, 22 September 1794, and mandatory use was suspended 7 April 1795 (18 Germinal of the Year III), in the same law which introduced the original metric system. Thus, although decimal time is sometimes referred to as metric time, the metric system at first had no time unit, and later versions of the metric system used the second, equal to 1/86400 day, as the metric time unit. In spite of this, decimal time was used in many cities, including Marseille and Toulouse, where a decimal clock with just an hour hand was {{on the front of the}} Capitole for five years. On the Palace of the Tuileries in Paris, two of the four clock faces <b>displayed</b> <b>decimal</b> time until at least 1801. The mathematician and astronomer Pierre-Simon Laplace had a decimal watch made for him, and used decimal time in his work, in the form of fractional days. Because of this, astronomers still use decimal time.|$|R
