2500|$|Historically, {{the term}} patriarchy {{was used to}} refer to autocratic rule by the male head of a family. However, in modern times, it more {{generally}} refers to social systems in which power is primarily held by adult men. One example definition of patriarchy by Sylvia Walby is [...] "a system of interrelated social structures which allow men to exploit women." [...] According to April A. Gordon, Walby's definition allows for the variability and changes in women's roles and in the order of their priority under different patriarchal systems. It also recognizes that it is the institutionalized subordination and exploitation of women by men that is the crux of patriarchy; this can take many forms. It is even theoretically possible that patriarchy could express itself through a <b>deemphasis</b> on motherhood in favor of women as wage earners or some other role.|$|E

50|$|Dolby noise {{reduction}} {{is a form}} of dynamic preemphasis employed during recording, plus a form of dynamic <b>deemphasis</b> used during playback, that work in tandem to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. While Dolby A operates across the whole spectrum, the other systems specifically emphasize the audible frequency range where background tape hiss, an artifact of the recording process that is similar to white noise, is most noticeable (usually above 1 kHz, or two octaves above Middle C).|$|E
50|$|The {{reason that}} preemphasis {{is needed is}} {{that the process of}} {{detecting}} a frequency-modulated signal in a receiver produces a noise spectrum that rises in frequency (a so-called triangular spectrum). Without preemphasis, the received audio would sound unacceptably noisy at high frequencies, especially under conditions of low carrier-to-noise ratio, i.e., during fringe reception conditions. Preemphasis increases the magnitude of the higher signal frequencies, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio. At the output of the discriminator in the FM receiver, a <b>deemphasis</b> network restores the original signal power distribution.|$|E
50|$|The {{sound is}} thus {{recorded}} {{at a higher}} overall level on the tape relative to the tape's overall noise level, requiring the tape formulation to preserve this specially recorded signal without distortion. On playback, the opposite process is applied (<b>deemphasis),</b> based on the relative signal component above 1 kHz. Thus as {{this portion of the}} signal decreases in amplitude, the higher frequencies are progressively more sharply attenuated, which also filters out the constant background noise on the tape when and where it would be most noticeable.|$|E

[...] Garraty stated that the New Deal lacked any consistent ideological base. While the Brains Trust got a lot of attention, theorists never had much impact on Roosevelt. Roosevelt drew on populism, with its hostility to bankers and its willingness to inflate the currency; Theodore Roosevelt's New Nationalism in its dislike of competition and <b>deemphasis</b> on antitrust laws; and the ideas of social workers from the Progressive Era.

50|$|Sergio Méndez Arceo was an {{advocate}} of the Vatican II principles, which moved for changes in ritual distribution of the sacraments, <b>deemphasis</b> on saints, more studying of the bible, and sociological studies to aid ecclesiastical organization. Méndez Arceo attempted unsuccessfully to have the Mexican Conference of Bishops explore the violent suppression of the student movements in 1968, known as Mexico 68. As an individual {{without the support of}} the church, Méndez Arceo assisted the imprisoned students, often called political prisoners, following the Tlatelolco Plaza massacre. In January 1970 Méndez Arceo informed the episcopate and fellow bishops of the condition of those prisoners; the episcopate made no references to the massacre itself or the outcome, in keeping with its nonconfrontational stance toward the government at the time. Méndez Arceo was also involved in other areas of social movements in Mexico such as striking Cuernavaca workers and guerrillas from Guerrero. The inaction by the episcopate against what was viewed as rampant social repression, is believed to be what sparked many individual clergy and Jesuits, and the episcopate's social secretariat, to shift from elite education to social action programs.|$|E
5000|$|Elision (brottfall) {{is common}} in Icelandic. There {{are a variety of}} rules for its occurrence, but the most notable is the loss of {{trailing}} consonants in common particles as well as the merger of similar vowel sounds. For example, the ubiquitous [...] "ég er að (verb)" [...] structure ("I am verb-ing") becomes transformed to [...] "éra (verb)"; the full particles is spoken only when a person is sounding the sentence out word by word. Another noteworthy and extremely common example along this line includes the phrase [...] "er það ekki?" [...] ("really?") which is pronounced as [...] "erþakki". A common example of internal consonant loss in Icelandic is [...] "gerðu svo vel" [...] ("here you go" [...] / [...] "please"), pronounced [...] "gjersovel" [...] (the hidden [...] "j" [...] sound is unrelated to the elision and occurs when a [...] or [...] precedes [...] ). Another special case of elision is the loss of [...] from the start of [...] "þetta" [...] ("this" [...] / [...] "that"), which is sometimes pronounced [...] "etta" [...] ("hvað er þetta" [...] (what is this?) -> [...] "hvaretta?"). The pronunciation of the full word tends to lay emphasis on it ("what is THIS") while the elision of the word leads to its <b>deemphasis</b> ("WHAT is this?"). The loss of the [...] in [...] "þetta" [...] is similar to how [...] can be lost in [...] "that" [...] and [...] "this" [...] when asking a question and speaking swiftly in English.|$|E
50|$|The {{departure}} of Leahy {{ushered in a}} downward slope in Notre Dame’s performance, referred to in various circles as a period of <b>deemphasis.</b> Terry Brennan was hired as the Notre Dame head coach in 1954 and would stay until 1958. He departed {{with a total of}} 32 wins and 18 losses. But note: the 32 wins included 17 in 1954 and 1955. From 1956 to 1958 his record was 15 - 15. Brennan was a former player under Leahy and before joining the Irish had coached the Mount Carmel High School team in Chicago, Illinois and later the freshman squad at Notre Dame. His first two seasons the Irish were ranked 4th and 9th respectively. However, in the light of what would follow those first seasons, some observers began to wonder if Brennan's early success owed more to the residual effects of Leahy's coaching on Brennan's first two cadres than it did to any notable brilliance of his own. It was the 1956 season that began to darken his reputation, for it {{became one of the most}} dismal in the team’s history and saw them finish the season with a mere 2 wins, including losses to Michigan State, Oklahoma, and Iowa. The Irish would recover the following season, posting a record of 7-3 and including in their wins a stunning upset of Oklahoma, in Norman, that ended the Sooners' still-standing record of 47 consecutive wins. In Brennan’s final season, though, the Irish finished 6-4. Brennan was fired in Mid-December and served as the conditioning coach for the Cincinnati Reds during spring training in 1959.|$|E
