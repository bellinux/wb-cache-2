The adaptive TDMNN architecture performs image compression and decompression by automatically choosing {{one of the}} three (linear, nonlinear and hybrid) TDMNN architectures based on input image entropy and required compression ratio.

The architecture is trained to reconstruct images in the presence of noise as well as channel errors. Abstract Software reference model for Adaptive TDMNN architecture is designed and modeled using Matlab. Modified backpropagation algorithm that can train two-dimensional network is proposed and is used to train the TDMNN architecture. Performance metrics such as Mean Square Error (MSE) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) are computed and compared with well established DWT-SPIHT technique. There is 10 % to 25 % improvement in reconstructed image quality measured in terms of MSE and PSNR compared to DWT-SPIHT technique.

Following the need for fast scalar multiplication, we decided for a hardware implementation on a FPGA device to achieve an adequate speed-up and increase in throughput. Hardware implementation is additionally simplified by the use of XOR gates for polynomial addition performed in GF(2 m). Squaring turned out to be quite simple and low-cost as well.

Exponentiation and inversion turned out to be relatively time consuming, since they both require a high number of iterations. Performance of elliptic curve arithmetic is dependent upon efficiency of binary field operations. The usage of projective coordinates significantly improves point addition and point doubling; it allows us to use only multiplications and squarings and to avoid inversion up to the last moment, i. e. the conversion of the projective point back to ordinary coordinates. Best results were achieved using projective coordinates Lopez-Dahab, which also prooved to be the best choice for point multiplication, that was implemented by a series of point additions and point doublings...|$|R
40|$|Multiplication is an {{arithmetic}} operation that is mostly used in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and communication applications. Efficient {{implementation of the}} multipliers is required in many applications. The design and analysis of Spurious Switching Suppression Technique (SSST) equipped low power <b>multiplier</b> with <b>hybrid</b> encoding is presented in this paper. The proposed encoding technique reduces the number of switching activity and dynamic power consumption by analyzing the bit patterns in the input data. In this proposed encoding scheme, the operation is executed depends upon the number of 1 ’s and {{its position in the}} multiplier data. The architecture of the proposed multiplier is designed using a low power full adder which consumes less power than the other adder architectures. The switching activity of the proposed multiplier has been reduced by 86 % and 46 % compared with conventional and Booth multiplier respectively. It is observed from the device level simulation using TANNER 12. 6 EDA that the power consumption of the proposed multiplier has been reduced by 87 % and 26 % compared with conventional and Booth multiplier.
