5|$|No player {{along the}} lane may enter the key until the shot is released; the player {{shooting}} the free throw, and anyone {{on top of}} the key, should not pass the free throw line until the ball hits the rim. If any of the offensive players violate the rule, no points are awarded for the shot and, if there are no more shots remaining, the ball is given to the defending team. If a defending player is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> too soon, an extra shot will be awarded regardless of whether the shot was made or missed.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} types of starts for races of different distances. Middle- and long-distance races mainly use the waterfall start. This is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves farther out at {{the outer edge of}} the track. Competitors are allowed to move towards the inside lane right away, as long as it is safe to do so. For some middle-distance races, such as 800m, each athlete starts in their own lane. Once the gun fires, they must run <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> they began in until markers on the track notify them it is time to move towards the inside lane. For sprint races, athletes begin in start blocks and must stay in their own lane for the entire race.|$|E

25|$|Possibly {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} {{area of interest}} is Gun’s Lane, which is named after a family who once lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane.</b> Today {{this is just a}} bridleway but it was for centuries the Cambridge to Ely causeway, which was the main road into the Fens and the Isle of Ely. The Iron Age ringfort that once stood at Arbury may well at one time have guarded one end of this road. During the Norman conquest of England, William the Conqueror passed this way with his army as he chased a rebel Saxon, Hereward the Wake, into the Fens.|$|E

Church Lane leads to Woodview cottages, which are built partly on the site of an old paper mill. The mill race previously mentioned passed under Butterfield Lane to the paper mill and continued on below Ashfield to turn the wheel of the Ely Cloth Factory. It was later turned into the Owen Doher River at Woodview Cottages. Until recently, when the new road was made to Templeogue, the old mill race could still be traced through the grounds of Ashfield where its dry bed was still spanned by several stone bridges.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} round (i.e., round of 64) of the NCAA Tournament, Duke {{defeated}} 16th seeded Robert Morris 85–56. Quinn Cook scored 22 points and Jahlil Okafor added 21. In the third round (i.e., round of 32), Duke beat San Diego State 68–49 behind 26 points by Okafor to reach the Sweet 16 (i.e., the South regional semifinals). Duke next faced off with 5th seeded Utah. A strong defensive performance limited Utah, the top three-point field goal shooting team in the Pac-12, to four-for-16 (25 percent) on three-point field goal attempts and 57 points overall. Okafor struggled against Utah's double teams, but Duke pulled away in the final minutes for a 63–57 win. Justise Winslow had a double-double, with 21 points and 10 rebounds for Duke. In the Elite Eight (i.e., the South regional final), Duke had another strong defensive performance, limiting 2nd seeded Gonzaga to two-for-10 (20 percent) on three-point field goal attempts. Point guard Tyus Jones earned six assists while committing 0 turnovers, and repeatedly scored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> as Duke pulled away from a 66–52 victory. Okafor, Winslow, Jones combined for 38 points. Jones earned regional Most Valuable Player (MVP) honors, as he averaged 15 points and 4.5 assists.|$|E
25|$|Two days later, {{the team}} {{would go on to}} beat San Francisco at home 66–52. Despite {{shooting}} 58 percent {{in the first half and}} building a lead of 24 at one point, the Bulldogs shot just 8 of 27 in the second half. They were led by Olynyk, who had 13 points, eight rebounds, three assists, three steals, and one assist. The team then travelled to Loyola Marymount on January 31, where they would rout the Lions 88–43. The team shot 13-for-21 from behind the three-point line and shot 54.4% from the field. Gary Bell, Jr. led the team with 15 points, which were entirely three-pointers. The team would face a tougher task when they went to San Diego two days later. The Zags left 36–27 at halftime, but San Diego would go on a run to drop the Gonzaga lead to 51–50. They trailed 57–53 with 7-and-a-half minutes left before outscoring the Toreros 12–6. Stockton would hit a runner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> with 55.9 seconds left, but Olynyk would miss the front end of a one-and-one to give San Diego a chance to win the game with eight seconds left. However, Harris would go on to block the last-second shot to secure the 65–63 victory. Harris scored 18 points and eight rebounds, while Olynyk and Bell added 15 and 13, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The Adaptive Cruise Control {{function}} senses {{the speed}} and pace of vehicles ahead, and can automatically adjust the speed the car is traveling at accordingly to maintain one of four user selectable gaps. Pre-Collision Braking uses the same cameras to monitor {{the activity of the}} vehicles ahead, and alerts the driver visually and audibly. If the driver fails to act, more alerts will be sounded and the car will actively brake itself. According to the IIHS, the Legacy prevented a collision while traveling at 25mph towards a stopped obstacle. When the car was first released for the 2015 model year, Lane Departure with Sway warning was included in the Eyesight package. This function watched the driver's position within the lane lines, and alerted the driver if they were drifting out of the lane (if a turn signal was used, this alert was not activated), with Sway warning notified the driver if they appeared to be unable to stay centered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane,</b> suggesting they may be overly drowsy. For the 2016 model year, a Lane Keep Assist was added, which applied steering torque to prevent the driver from drifting from the lane. This function is active above 40 miles an hour. Also standard on all cars with the Eyesight system are adaptive fog lights aid in turns and cornering and is based on the steering wheel degree.|$|E

In his first year as a Knick, Houston took the place of John Starks in the starting lineup, with Starks serving as a mentor for him coming off the bench. Houston kept his scoring average at 17 points per game, and helped lead the team to the 1999 NBA Finals. His most famous play came in the decisive Game 5 of the first round of the 1999 Eastern Conference quarterfinals against the Miami Heat. In the fourth quarter, with the Knicks inbounding the ball trailing by one point, Houston caught the inbounds pass, and made a running jumper <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> with 0.8 second left on the clock to win the game and the series for the Knicks, 78-77, which was then only the second time in NBA playoffs history where a #8 seed had defeated a #1.

500|$|In the 1951–52 NBA season, the NBA {{decided to}} widen the foul lane under the basket from 6 feet to 12 feet. As players could stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> for only three seconds at a time, it forced big men like Mikan to post-up from double the distance. A main proponent of this rule was New York Knicks coach Joe Lapchick, who {{regarded}} Mikan as his nemesis, and it was dubbed [...] "The Mikan Rule". While Mikan still scored an impressive 23.8 points per game, it was a serious reduction from his 27.4 points per game the previous season, and his field goal percentage sank from [...]428 to [...]385. He still pulled down 13.5 rebounds per game, asserting himself as a top rebounder, and logged 3.0 assists per game. Mikan also had a truly dominating game that season, in which he scored a personal-best 61 points in a double overtime victory against the Rochester Royals. At the time, it was the second-best performance in league history behind Joe Fulks' 63-point score in 1949, and Mikan's output more than doubled that of his teammates, whose output that game totaled 30 points. In the 1952 NBA All-Star Game, Mikan had a strong performance with 26 points and 15 rebounds in a West loss. Later that season, the Lakers reached the 1952 NBA Finals and were pitted against the New York Knicks. This qualified {{as one of the}} strangest Finals series in NBA history, as neither team could play on their home court in the first six games. The Lakers' Minneapolis Auditorium was already booked, and the Knicks' Madison Square Garden was occupied by the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Instead, the Lakers played in St. Paul and the Knicks in the damp, dimly lit 69th Regiment Armory. Perpetually double-teamed by Knicks' Nat Clifton and Harry Gallatin, Mikan was unable to assert himself and it was more Vern Mikkelsen's credit that the first six games were split. In the only true home game, Game 7 in the Auditorium, the Lakers won 82–65 and edged the Knicks 4–3, winning the NBA title and earning themselves $7,500 to split among the team.|$|E

Both HRT cars {{qualified}} for the race, but filled out the final row of the grid almost two seconds behind Marussia's Charles Pic in twenty-second position. In the race, Hamilton made a better start than Jenson Button, but his lead was short-lived; heavy rain interrupted the race, forcing the suspension of the Grand Prix. When the race restarted an hour later, Button was involved in contact with Narain Karthikeyan that forced him to make an unscheduled stop for a new front wing, while Hamilton had a slow pit stop and was held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> while other cars passed. Fernando Alonso inherited the lead, with Sauber's Sergio Pérez a surprise second, having made an early stop for extreme wet weather tyres and then taking advantage of a rush to the pit lane to position himself in third at the restart. As the race wore on, Pérez began to quickly catch Alonso on a drying track. Daniel Ricciardo was the first driver to pit for dry-weather tyres on lap 38, triggering another round of stops. Sauber and Pérez initially looked as if they had left their stop too late when Pérez emerged from the pits five seconds behind Alonso, but he began catching the two-time World Champion {{at the same rate as}} he had before. Pérez closed to within half a second with seven laps to go, but ran wide at turn 14 and lost five seconds, later admitting that it was his mistake. He was unable to close the gap, and Alonso went on to win the race by two seconds, the win giving him a five-point lead in the championship. Pérez was second, taking his first podium and Sauber's best ever result as an independent team. Hamilton finished third ahead of Mark Webber and Kimi Räikkönen, while Button had to settle for fourteenth. Bruno Senna finished in sixth, scoring more points in a single race than his team scored in [...] Sebastian Vettel finished outside the points after making contact with Karthikeyan and developing a puncture.|$|E
