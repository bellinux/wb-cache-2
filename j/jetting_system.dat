40|$|The {{offshore}} wind turbine in shallow water is installed by a self-elevated mobile unit which is usually referred to as jack-up barge or jack-up vessel. The jack-up vessel consists of a buoyant platform together with independent legs that can position the vessel above the water reducing external loadings for safe operation condition. The retrieval process of jack-up legs could be very difficult due to the high extraction resistance caused by soft soil. In soft clay, since the high suction force can be developed around the spudcan attached {{at the end of}} jack-up legs, a <b>jetting</b> <b>system</b> is required to break the suction to pull out the legs. It is important to design the <b>jetting</b> <b>system</b> with optimized piping arrangement to allow the easy operation. There are various factors to be considered in the design of jetting piping system since the level of embedment and the type of soil and pipe size and locations, etc. can affect the performance of the system.

40|$|Executive Summary SPAWAR, a {{research}} and development side of the U. S. Navy, needed a way to bury classified payloads below the seafloor in order to anchor the devices. They currently use a <b>jetting</b> <b>system</b> that costs around $ 20, 000 to do it, and they desired a cheaper system capable of performing the same tasks. SPAWAR presented the project to Cal Poly Mechanical Engineers as a senior project {{in the fall of}} 2016. The design team that decided to take on the project was interested in creating the system with two key factors in mind {{in order to make the}} device less expensive. 1. Find the minimal water jet pressure and flow rate requirements to allow for a payload to bury itself. 2. Create the system using as inexpensive stock materials as possible without compromising functional requirements. After creating the system our team was able to test and verify its functionality and found that it was able to successfully bury itself and complete almost every required task. One of the largest issues we ran into was the fact that our Node, or the capsule that holds a payload, was too light and would become buoyant at certain depths. While analyzing the tests we ran, we were able to create a list of recommendations as to what SPAWAR should do when creating their system in order to make it cost effective and functional. The following report details the design, build, test, and report process that the team underwent to create the functioning Low-Cost <b>Jetting</b> <b>System...</b>|$|E

40|$|A fluidic pulse <b>jet</b> mixing <b>system,</b> {{designed}} and fabricated by AEA Technology, was successfully demonstrated for mobilization of remote-handled transuranic (RH-TRU) sludge for retrieval from three 50, 000 -gal horizontal waste storage tanks (W- 21, W- 22, and W- 23) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The pulse <b>jet</b> <b>system</b> is unique {{because it does}} not contain any moving parts except for some solenoid valves which can be easily replaced if necessary. The pulse <b>jet</b> <b>system</b> consisted of seven modular equipment skids and was installed and commissioned in about 7 weeks. The system used specially designed fluidic jet pumps and charge vessels, along with existing submerged nozzles for mixing the settled sludges with existing supernate in the tank. The operation also used existing piping and progressive cavity pumps for retrieval and transfer of the waste mixtures. The pulse <b>jet</b> <b>system</b> operated well and experienced no major equipment malfunctions. The modular design, use of quick-connect couplings, and low-maintenance aspects of the system minimized radiation exposure during installation and operation of the system. The extent of sludge removal from the tanks was limited by the constraints of using the existing tank nozzles and the physical characteristics of the sludge. Removing greater than 98 % of this sludge would require aggressive use of the manual sluicer (and associated water additions), a shielded sluicer system that utilizes supernate from existing inventory, or a more costly and elaborate robotic retrieval system. The results of this operation indicate that the pulse <b>jet</b> <b>system</b> should be considered for mixing and bulk retrieval of sludges in other horizontal waste tanks at ORNL and US Department of Energy sites...|$|R

40|$|AbstractScaffolds are {{essential}} in bone tissue engineering, as they provide support to cells and growth factors necessary to regenerate tissue. In addition, they meet the mechanical {{function of the}} bone while it regenerates. Currently, the multiple methods for designing and manufacturing scaffolds are based on regular structures from a unit cell that repeats in a given domain. However, these methods do not resemble the actual structure of the trabecular bone which may work against osseous tissue regeneration. To explore the design of porous structures with similar mechanical properties to native bone, a geometric generation scheme from a reaction-diffusion model and its manufacturing via a material <b>jetting</b> <b>system</b> is proposed. This article presents the methodology used, the geometric characteristics and the modulus of elasticity of the scaffolds designed and manufactured. The method proposed shows its potential to generate structures that allow to control the basic scaffold properties for bone tissue engineering such as {{the width of the}} channels and porosity. The mechanical properties of our scaffolds are similar to trabecular tissue present in vertebrae and tibia bones. Tests on the manufactured scaffolds show {{that it is necessary to}} consider the orientation of the object relative to the printing system because the channel geometry, mechanical properties and roughness are heavily influenced by the position of the surface analyzed with respect to the printing axis.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The main aim of this project {{was to investigate the}} possibility of manufacturing 3 D parts of polyamide (nylon or PA) 6 by inkjetting its monomer caprolactam (CL). The principle of this process was similar to the other rapid prototype (RP) and rapid manufacturing (RM) processes in which a 3 D part is manufactured by layer on layer deposition of material. PA 6 was used as the thermoplastic polymer in this work because of its good properties and also because PA 6 can be produced by heating its monomer (i. e. plus catalyst and activator) in a short time. Two polymerisation mixtures of CL-catalyst (mixture A) and CL-activator (mixture B) are intended to be jetted separately using conventional jetting heads and polymerise shortly after heating. Anionic polymerisation of CL (APCL) was investigated in the bulk and on a smaller scale. Sodium caprolactamate (CLNa and C 10) and caprolactam magnesium bromide (CLMgBr) were used as catalysts and N-acetylcaprolactam (ACL) and a di-functional activator (C 20) were used as activators. The influence of polymerisation conditions was investigated and optimised. These were catalyst-activator concentration, polymerisation temperature and the influence of the polymerisation atmosphere. The physical properties (monomer conversion, crystallinity, and viscosity average molecular weight) of PA 6 samples produced using each catalyst-activator combinations were measured and compared. Small scale polymerisation was carried out using a hotplate, by hot stage microscopy and using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The influence of heating strategy on small scale polymerisation was studied using DSC. The polymerisation mixture compositions were characterised using rheometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and optical microscopy to investigate their suitability in jetting for using the available jetting heads. It was shown that the combination of CLMgBr-ACL resulted in fast polymerisation which was not sensitive to moisture. The C 10 -C 20 combination resulted in fast polymerisation with the best properties in a protected environment (nitrogen); however, the polymerisation was affected by moisture in air and the properties of polymer produced and rate of polymerisation decreased in air. Polymers produced using CLNa-ACL had the poorest properties and polymerisation did not occur in air. Material characterisation showed that micro-crystals of CLMgBr existed in CLMgBr-CL mixture at the jetting temperature (80 oC) which were too large to be jetted. However, the mixture of C 10 in CL could be partially jetted. The activator mixtures had similar properties to CL and were easily jetted. Drop on drop polymerisation was carried out by dripping droplets of mixtures A and B (at 80 oC) {{on top of each other}} on a hotplate at the polymerisation temperature. Small scale polymerisation in a DSC showed that the monomer conversion increased with increase in polymerisation temperature from 140 oC to 180 oC and decreased from 180 oC to 200 oC. The crystallinity of the polymer produced in the DSC decreased with increase in polymerisation temperature. Hot stage microscopy produced evidence for simultaneous polymerisation and crystallisation processes on heating. Small scale polymerisation in an oven and analysed by DSC showed that increasing catalystactivator concentration resulted in increasing monomer conversion and decrease in crystallinity. Monomer conversion also increased with increase in polymerisation temperature and polymerisation time. Comparison between small scale and bulk polymerisations shows a good agreement between the two polymerisation rates. This shows that the polymerisation mechanism did not change significantly when the quantity of materials was reduced to less than 20 mg. Finally, the polymerisation was carried out in a DSC after jetting C 10 -CL and C 20 -CL mixtures into a DSC pan using a <b>jetting</b> <b>system,</b> which was made in another work...|$|E
