25|$|In 1974 Minox {{introduced}} a very compact (100mm × 61mm × 31mm), glass fibre reinforced Makrolon bodied 35 mm film camera designed by Professor Fischer of Vienna University: the Minox EL, {{the first one}} in Minox 35mm series. These compact cameras featured a drawbridge style lens cover which when lowered brought forward a 35mm focal length f/2.8 four-element, three-group Tessar-type Minotar/Minoxar lens with between the lens leaf shutter and diaphragm, a center positioned viewfinder, two stroke film winder lever and a <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> knob. The Minox 35 camera back must be removed for loading or unloading film.|$|E
50|$|During its {{production}} run, Nikon replaced the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> spool for these cameras {{due to a}} manufacturing defect.|$|E
5000|$|The camera's {{top plate}} has the {{manually}} set frame counter, the shutter release, the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> knob with film reminder dial, the exposure needle window, meter adjustment knob with EV and ASA/DIN scales, the film (advance) release button, the frame (counter) advance slider, and the accessory shoe. The bottom plate contains the tripod socket, the film advance lever, the back release latch, and the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> release button.|$|E
50|$|At {{this point}} the <b>film</b> <b>rewinds</b> to the opening scene when Angélique bought the pink rose. This time the film follows the {{delivery}} boy and the subsequent events play out from Loïc's viewpoint.|$|R
50|$|Exposure {{control was}} {{aperture}} priority AE using center-weighted light metering. Film speeds {{of the camera}} range from ASA 25 to ASA 1600. Film winding was done by using the film-wind lever located on the top right of the camera. <b>Film</b> <b>rewinding</b> was done manually using the film-rewind crank located at the top left. The camera body measured 136 × 83 × 50 mm and weighed approximately 430 g.|$|R
50|$|As {{an example}} of a static application, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) product Clevios P (Figure 7) from Heraeus has been {{extensively}} used as an antistatic coating (as packaging materials for electronic components, for example). AGFA coats 200 m × 10 m of photographic film per year with PEDOT:PSS because of its antistatic properties. The thin layer of PEDOT:PSS is virtually transparent and colorless, prevents electrostatic discharges during <b>film</b> <b>rewinding,</b> and reduces dust buildup on the negatives after processing.|$|R

50|$|There is a self timer, flash, autofocus, ISO range, and <b>film</b> <b>rewind.</b> The ISO {{range is}} a black slider {{on the bottom of}} the camera.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Leech {{appeared}} in the HBO drama series Rome as Marcus Agrippa, Octavian's top soldier and friend. The <b>film,</b> <b>Rewind,</b> opened in Ireland on 25 March 2011.|$|E
50|$|The F4 was {{the first}} Nikon F-series lacking a manual film-advance lever, though it offered both {{motor-driven}} and manual <b>film</b> <b>rewinding.</b> Like previous F-series cameras, the F4 featured {{a high degree of}} customization to specific tasks, with various remote controls, film backs, and viewfinders available. While it was a complex camera with over 1700 parts, the F4's high-quality mechanical and electronic components, as well as weather sealing and tough construction, made for a reliable and long-lived professional SLR.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{difference}} to the conventional design was the cocking lever. On the Rollei 35, the lever {{is located at the}} top left and the <b>film</b> <b>rewinding</b> crank at the bottom right of the camera body (instead of the cocking lever being at the top right and the rewind crank at the top left). The cartridge sits in {{the right side of the}} camera and correspondingly the exposures lay [...] "upside down" [...] on the film, reflected by the inverted position of the film inscriptions (type, frame numbers) of under/over landscape pictures. To change the film, the back must be slid downwards and removed fully, like on the Leica, for example.|$|R

50|$|Oshii {{appeared}} in the 2013 documentary <b>film,</b> <b>Rewind</b> This! {{about the impact of}} VHS on the film industry and home video. He also recently had a get-together with Duncan Jones.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, the Pentax placed {{controls}} in locations {{that would become}} standard on 35 mm SLRs from all manufacturers, such as the right-handed rapid wind lever, the bottom right mounted rewind release, and film speed reminder around the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> crank.|$|E
5000|$|All their SLR cameras, {{except the}} dx-3, had {{interchangeable}} pentaprisms (released by moving a button or twisting {{the base of}} the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> knob), and a unique dual lens mount; an external bayonet mount or a 44mm thread mount within the mirror box.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2008 <b>film</b> Be Kind <b>Rewind,</b> Waller was a {{major theme}} and {{influence}} for the storyline.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>film</b> <b>rewinds</b> into a flashback. It is 2010. Kakababu is {{contracted}} by Egyptian businessman Al Mamun (Rajit Kapur) {{to decipher}} the meanings of hieroglyphic symbols that his teacher, Mufti Muhammad (Barun Chanda), had drawn {{on a piece of}} paper supposedly during his sleep. Muhammad is terminally ill and is about to grant his last wish while he is being treated in Delhi. Mamun thinks that the symbols are the key for locating Mufti Muhammad's will which will describe where to find treasures Mufti Muhammad had acquired during his tenure as a political leader and revolutionary. However, Kakababu is convinced that the symbols have a different meaning and they are very unusual. Mufti Muhammad symbolically requests Kakababu to verify something, a very unusual last wish.|$|R
50|$|The {{song was}} used as the music for a film-making montage in Michel Gondry's 2008 <b>film</b> Be Kind <b>Rewind.</b>|$|R
50|$|The camera has a hinged, swing-open, {{camera back}} with cut-out view window toshow {{details of the}} film loaded in the camera. Film loading,advance and rewind is {{motorised}} and automatic. A button to manually trigger <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> isalso provided. Film sensitivity can be detected via standard DX encodingor the ISO value can be selected manually.|$|E
5000|$|... 1957: Asahi Pentax (Japan; called Sears Tower 26 in USA): first SLR with {{right-handed}} rapid-wind thumb lever, first fold-out <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> crank, first microprism focusing aid. First Asahi SLR with M42 screw mount. Established the [...] "modern" [...] control {{layout of}} the 35 mm SLR. Well-integrated focal-plane shutter, instant return mirror and pentaprism design.|$|E
50|$|The Konica Hexar RF has a hinged, swing-open, {{camera back}} with cut-out view window {{to show the}} film loaded in the camera. Film loading, advance and rewind is {{motorised}} and automatic. A button to manually trigger <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> is also provided. Film sensitivity can be detected via standard DX encoding or the ISO value can be selected manually.|$|E
50|$|The EOS 100 {{came with}} a {{motorised}} belt drive for <b>film</b> winding and <b>rewinding.</b> Canon claimed this made it the quietest camera in the EOS range.|$|R
5000|$|Dunn is {{credited}} with performing on {{a version of the}} standard [...] "I Ain't Got Nobody" [...] with Jones, Cropper and Michel Gondry in Gondry's 2008 <b>film</b> Be Kind <b>Rewind.</b>|$|R
50|$|The film {{begins with}} Varun (Nani) gaining {{admission}} into an engineering college. He {{and his friends}} one day participate in a cultural programme, where Varun finds his childhood sweetheart Nithya (Samantha) participating in a dance show. He begins wooing her by singing on stage and later meeting her. As they meet, the <b>film</b> <b>rewinds</b> to their early days when both were in third standard. They become good friends after a small incident and their friendship blossoms. But due to a misunderstanding, Nithya decides not to meet Varun and to never talk with him. However, as destiny would have it, they meet again in their tenth standard. Nithya initially hesitates to talk with Varun, but sheds her inhibitions once Varun breaks the ice between them, and resumes her friendship with him. Nithya is elected as the pupil leader in school and as a pupil leader she is in constant interaction with Deepak, another pupil leader and her classmate, much {{to the dismay of}} Varun. As a result, they have another fallout.|$|R
50|$|Henenlotter {{appeared}} in the 2013 documentary <b>film</b> <b>Rewind</b> This!, {{about the impact of}} VHS on the film industry and home video. He also appeared with the film's director, Josh Johnson, when it screened at film festivals such as the Telluride Horror Show. In 2014, he directed Chasing Banksy, which was screened with a visit of Henenlotter at New York City Forbidden Planet.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, the Pentax placed {{controls}} in locations {{that would become}} standard on 35 mm SLRs from all manufacturers, such as the right-handed rapid wind lever, the bottom right mounted rewind release. It also had a film speed reminder around the <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> crank, a location that remained standard until the dial went from being merely a reminder to the photographer to actually controlling the light meter built into later SLRs.|$|E
50|$|Accessories for the OM-4 {{included}} all the Olympus motor drives {{made for the}} OM-System cameras. Motor Drive 2 was introduced with the OM-4 and, in addition to automatic film advance (up to 5 frames per second), featured motorized <b>film</b> <b>rewind.</b> The camera accepted the Olympus 250-exposure bulk film back (10 meters of film = 250 frames) and the Olympus T-system flashes. The T45 handle-mount electronic flash (guide number 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA/ISO 100) was also introduced with the OM-4.|$|E
50|$|Film {{transport}} is {{very different}} from Leica M-mount film cameras, which require manual film handling through a removable bottom plate and flip-up camera back, with <b>film</b> advance and <b>rewind</b> using manual levers and rewind cranks.|$|R
25|$|In the 2008 <b>film</b> Be Kind <b>Rewind,</b> Jerry (Jack Black) gets magnetized, thus erasing all {{the tapes}} in his friend's video store. They {{set out to}} remake the movies, {{and one of them}} is King Kong.|$|R
50|$|The T60 shared {{little with}} the other T-series models except for a {{superficial}} styling resemblance. Unlike them, it had only manual film loading, advance and <b>rewind.</b> <b>Film</b> speed and shutter speed were set with traditional dials.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{variations}} of the Leica M2. Although most models have the self-timer lever, it is absent from some earlier models. Also, some early models have a <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> push-button instead of the typical lever. About 2400 M2s were factory-painted black, but these are relatively rare and more valued by collectors. Near the end of production, Leica also produced a number of M2-R models, which had the faster loading system of the later Leica M4.|$|E
50|$|The Leica MP is Leica's {{latest film}} {{rangefinder}} camera. Unlike the preceding Leica M7, the camera has adopted many retro design features {{from the earlier}} M3. These include a M3 type metal film advance lever, knob <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> design and M3 type frameline adjust lever. The basic classic design remains unchanged and the design for loading film from the bottom has been retained. The camera comes in various camera finishes including black chrome, black paint and silver chrome and can be further customised with Leica AG's à la carte program.|$|E
50|$|Like all {{previous}} Nikon F series cameras, the F5 maintained a manual <b>film</b> <b>rewind</b> (with a rapid power rewind built in), high durability, exceptionally short shutter lag, interchangeable 100% coverage viewfinders (including a large-view Action Finder, Waist-Level Finder, and 6x High-Magnification Finder, {{in addition to}} the stock DP-30 multi-metering pentaprism), and support {{for a wide range of}} Nikon F-mount lenses. In common with the F3 and F4 it relied upon battery power in order to function, either from eight AA batteries or an optional rechargeable NiMH battery pack.|$|E
50|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} M series cameras, there is a window next to the winder arm which indicated film movement, and assists the user in <b>rewinding</b> <b>film</b> into the cassette without losing {{the tip of the}} film.|$|R
5000|$|Participant Media {{announced}} that it would produce Dinello's next film, Mr. Burnout (about a burned out teacher seeking to rekindle his love of teaching). He also appeared as Mr. Rooney in the <b>film</b> Be Kind <b>Rewind,</b> alongside Jack Black ...|$|R
5000|$|The only {{automatic}} function {{offered by the}} LC-A is exposure. <b>Film</b> loading, winding, <b>rewinding,</b> and focus adjustments are accomplished manually. Aperture can also be set manually, the shutter speed being fixed at [...] s (this ability {{was removed from the}} LC-A+).|$|R
