Clemenson was apprehensive about pursuing one of the lead roles in a television show because of the long time commitments involved. He later said, [...] "The similarities between this show and The Wild Wild West, and my character to that show's Artemus Gordon, was an important hook for me. It {{was one of my}} favorite shows growing up, and as soon as I saw that Brisco County was based on the same kind of material and attitude as that show, I called my agent and said, 'I'll do anything <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> get this. Clemenson applied his experiences at Ivy League schools to play the uptight Poole. Praising Clemenson's work on Brisco, Cuse said, [...] "You can't give him anything he's not capable of doing. He adds the voice of intelligence and caution to balance our cast".|$|E

There's a lot of things I haven't done I want to do, and I'll also do some things <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> help the statehood cause". Ramírez was a candidate for Resident Commissioner in the primaries and was openly supporting Rosselló.

The man responds: [...] "You won't blame me, then, for taking your clothes. That's what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> keep from starving to death".

5000|$|In 2009, {{while helping}} {{journalist}} Steve Miller with {{research on the}} Sarah Pender case, former prosecutor Larry Sells {{became aware of the}} existence of a snitch list written by Floyd Pennington and given to Detective Ken Martinez.

It was not given to either the defense or the prosecution at the time of Pender's trial. This discovery led Larry Sells to believe that Sarah Pender did not get a fair trial. In an interview to the Indianapolis Star, he explained : [...] "If I'd have seen that I never would have put Floyd Pennington on the witness stand." [...] In May 2012, he contacted Bonnie Prosser, Sarah Pender's mother, and promised to help her set things right.|$|E
