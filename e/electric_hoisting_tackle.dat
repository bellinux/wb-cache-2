40|$|This {{contribution}} {{describes the}} effect of a load shape on load acceleration at the start of an <b>electric</b> <b>hoist.</b> The emphasis is on a comparison of acceleration course of loads. Two loads with entirely different shape-a load with a cuboid shape and one with a cylinder shape, were chosen. Improved mathematical theory for the start of an <b>electric</b> <b>hoist</b> with three degrees of freedom is used. Thus, we measured the acceleration of the <b>electric</b> <b>hoist,</b> the wire rope end and the load center of gravity for two loads with different shape. Web of Science 2772069206...|$|R
6000|$|There was the mainmast, fifteen {{inches in}} {{diameter}} at what was now the butt, still sixty-five feet in length, and weighing, I roughly calculated, at least three thousand pounds. And then came the foremast, larger in diameter, and weighing surely thirty-five hundred pounds. Where was I to begin? Maud stood silently by my side, while I evolved in my mind the contrivance known among sailors as “shears.” But, though known to sailors, I invented it there on Endeavour Island. By crossing and lashing the ends of two spars, and then elevating them {{in the air like}} an inverted “V,” I could get a point above the deck to which to make fast my <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackle.</b> To this <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackle</b> I could, if necessary, attach a second <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackle.</b> And then there was the windlass! ...|$|R

60|$|At {{the end of}} an {{hour the}} single and double blocks came {{together}} {{at the top of the}} shears. I could hoist no more. And yet the mast was not swung entirely inboard. The butt rested against the outside of the port rail, while the top of the mast overhung the water far beyond the starboard rail. My shears were too short. All my work had been for nothing. But I no longer despaired in the old way. I was acquiring more confidence in myself and more confidence in the possibilities of windlasses, shears, and <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackles.</b> There was a way in which it could be done, and it remained for me to find that way.|$|R
2500|$|The fixed {{undercarriage}} {{consists of}} large paired main-wheel units on oleo-pneumatic levered shock absorbers mounted {{at the junction}} of [...] a strut system supporting the rotor systems and wings and connected to the centre fuselage by a tripod strut structure with the nose-leg attached aft of the crew section. A pair of bumper wheels are mounted {{at the rear of}} the fuselage keel and fixed support pads ensure that the cargo ramp is extended to the correct angle. Long braced struts also connected the transmission units to the rear fuselage forward of the fin. Cargo handling is by forklift or <b>electric</b> <b>hoists</b> on traveling beams.|$|R
60|$|In {{less than}} an hour I had the maintopmast on deck and was {{constructing}} the shears. Lashing the two topmasts together, and making allowance for their unequal length, at the point of intersection I attached the double block of the main throat-halyards. This, with the single block and the throat-halyards themselves, gave me a <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackle.</b> To prevent the butts of the masts from slipping on the deck, I nailed down thick cleats. Everything in readiness, I made a line fast to the apex of the shears and carried it directly to the windlass. I was growing to have faith in that windlass, for it gave me power beyond all expectation. As usual, Maud held the turn while I heaved. The shears rose in the air.|$|R
2500|$|To {{operate the}} quarries, {{structures}} for various functions were {{built around the}} quarry exterior. [...] Wooden derricks were located by and above the openings to lift blocks out of the quarries. [...] The boiler house (providing steam power for quarrying equipment) was the last major addition (second building {{to the right of}} opening 2). In front of the boiler house is a 50-ton (49.875 metric ton) <b>electric</b> <b>hoist</b> and the <b>hoist</b> <b>electric</b> power house is {{to the right of the}} boiler house. Below the boiler house area near the bottom of the photo is the Pea Vine (winch-cable powered carts on rails) used to move marble from the quarry to the loading station several hundred feet away, where it was placed on wagons for transport to the mill site. [...] There are other facilities to the right of opening 1; compressor house, machine shop, and bunk house. [...] To provide the needed electricity, the company built a hydro-electric plant with the generators located just east of the town limits and completed in July 1907.|$|R
60|$|But we did {{not have}} to wait long, and the problem solved itself. In the morning, after several trials, I found the point of balance in the {{foremast}} and attached my <b>hoisting</b> <b>tackle</b> a few feet above it. Maud held the turn on the windlass and coiled down while I heaved. Had the windlass been in order {{it would not have been}} so difficult; as it was, I was compelled to apply all my weight and strength to every inch of the heaving. I had to rest frequently. In truth, my spells of resting were longer than those of working. Maud even contrived, at times when all my efforts could not budge the windlass, to hold the turn with one hand and with the other to throw the weight of her slim body to my assistance.|$|R
