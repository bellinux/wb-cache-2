5|$|A Franco-Belgian {{comic book}} (bande dessinée) {{on the life}} of Escrivá was {{published}} by Coccinelle BD in 2005. The title is Through the mountains, in reference to Escriva's escape <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> zone through the mountains of Andorra during the Spanish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The last {{sentence}} {{of the passage}} is similar to one <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> era Biography of Song Yue, Prince of E. But instead of teaching them his own technique, it states Yue taught what he had learned from Zhou to his soldiers who were victorious in battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{party is}} officially {{committed}} to multi-tendency democratic socialism. The Socialist Party USA, {{along with its}} predecessor, has received varying degrees of support when its candidates have competed against those <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> and Democratic parties. The SPUSA advocates for complete independence from the Democratic Party.|$|E

5|$|On November 6, 1860, Lincoln {{was elected}} the 16th {{president}} of the United States, beating Douglas, Breckinridge, and Bell. He was the first president <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party. His victory was entirely due {{to the strength of}} his support in the North and West; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states.|$|E
5|$|From {{the close}} of the Civil War until 1895, Kentuckians elected a series of Bourbon Democrats with Confederate sympathies as governor, {{including}} two men—James B. McCreary and Simon Bolivar Buckner—who had served in the Confederate States Army. The Democratic dominance was broken by William O'Connell Bradley, who was elected the state's first Republican governor in 1895. Bradley's election marked the beginning of thirty years of true, two-party competition for the governorship in the state. Between 1895 and 1931, five Republicans and six Democrats held the office of governor. Since 1931, however, the Republicans have been unable to preserve this level of parity, and in that period only four of the twenty elected governors have been <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> party, including incumbent Matt Bevin.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, the Democratic-dominated state {{legislature}} {{passed a bill}} requiring payment of a poll tax for voting, which effectively disenfranchised most blacks, and many poor whites and Latinos. In addition, the legislature established white primaries, ensuring that minorities {{were excluded from the}} formal political process. The number of voters dropped dramatically, and the Democrats crushed competition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> and Populist parties. The Socialist Party became the second largest party in Texas after 1912, coinciding with a large socialist upsurge in the United States during fierce battles in the labor movement and the popularity of national heroes like Eugene V. Debs. The Socialists' popularity soon waned after their vilification by the United States government for their opposition to US involvement in World War I.|$|E

50|$|The United States Senate {{elections}} of 1922 and 1923 were elections {{that occurred in}} <b>the</b> middle of <b>Republican</b> President Warren G. Harding's term.

5|$|In the meantime, the {{divisions}} in the state party proved ruinous for Randall's chances at the Speaker's chair. Instead, the Democrats decided on Michael C. Kerr of Indiana, who was elected. Randall was instead named chairman of the Appropriations Committee. In that post, he focused on reducing the government's spending, and cut the budget by $30,000,000, despite opposition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Senate. Kerr's health was fragile, and he was often absent from sessions, but Randall refused {{to take his place}} as speaker on a temporary basis, preferring to concentrate on his appropriations work. Kerr and Randall began to work more closely together through 1876, but Kerr died in August of that year, leaving the Speakership vacant once again.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{stood to}} benefit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> electorate's {{tendency}} to nominate candidates {{who had previously}} run for president, and thus appeared to be next in line to be chosen. The {{early stages of the}} race found him as the apparent front-runner in a weak field, especially in terms of fundraising prowess and organization. Perhaps his greatest hurdle in gaining the Republican nomination was party opposition to the Massachusetts health care reform law that he had shepherded five years earlier. As many potential Republican candidates with star power and fundraising ability decided not to run (including Mike Pence, John Thune, Haley Barbour, Mike Huckabee, and Mitch Daniels), Republican party figures searched for plausible alternatives to Romney.|$|E
5|$|While on tour, {{a number}} of {{statements}} by Madonna against 2008 American Republican Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates John McCain and Sarah Palin respectively, faced strong opposition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party. While performing in Romania in 2009, Madonna's statement about gypsy discrimination in eastern European countries was also received negatively. During the second leg, two workers constructing her stage at Stade Vélodrome in Marseille were killed when {{the roof of the}} stage collapsed. The Sticky & Sweet Tour has been broadcast on {{a number of}} private channels and a CD-DVD and Blu-ray version of the concert was released in March 2010.|$|E
50|$|This {{would be}} the Democrats {{greatest}} triumph in history and would mark the high-water mark of their national power. In spite of concerted and sometimes vicious attacks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> <b>the</b> New Deal and {{the hope that it}} provided, had been decisively and overwhelmingly ratified by the working class, poor, elderly, blacks, and middle class across the nation.|$|R
50|$|Upset over President Taft's actions during Arizona's {{efforts to}} gain statehood, Kibbey split <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> and {{supported}} <b>the</b> Bull Moose Party during the 1912 elections.

50|$|The 1876 South Carolina United States House of Representatives {{elections}} were held on November 7, 1876 to select five Representatives for two-year terms <b>from</b> <b>the</b> state of South Carolina. Two incumbents were re-elected, one was defeated for re-election, and the Democrats {{picked up one}} of the two open seats <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> <b>The</b> composition of the state delegation after the election was three Republicans and two Democrats.|$|R
5|$|The 1974 Congressional midterm {{elections}} took place {{less than three}} months after Ford assumed office and {{in the wake of the}} Watergate scandal. The Democratic Party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the House elections, taking 49 seats <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, increasing their majority to 291 of the 435 seats. This was one more than the number needed (290) for a two-thirds majority, the number necessary to override a Presidential veto or to propose a constitutional amendment. Perhaps due in part to this fact, the 94th Congress overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since Andrew Johnson was President of the United States (1865–1869). Even Ford's former, reliably Republican House seat was won by a Democrat, Richard Vander Veen, who defeated Robert VanderLaan. In the Senate elections, the Democratic majority became 61 in the 100-seat body.|$|E
5|$|Two calamities in {{the autumn}} of 1906 shocked African Americans, and they contributed to {{strengthening}} support for Du Bois's struggle for civil rights to prevail over Booker T. Washington's accommodationism. First, President Teddy Roosevelt dishonorably discharged 167 black soldiers because they were accused of crimes {{as a result of the}} Brownsville Affair. Many of the discharged soldiers had served for 20 years and were near retirement. Second, in September, riots broke out in Atlanta, precipitated by unfounded allegations of black men assaulting white women. This was a catalyst for racial tensions based on a job shortage and employers playing black workers against white workers. Ten thousand whites rampaged through Atlanta, beating every black person they could find, resulting in over 25 deaths. In the aftermath of the 1906 violence, Du Bois urged blacks to withdraw their support <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, because Republicans Roosevelt and William Howard Taft did not sufficiently support blacks. Most African Americans had been loyal to the Republican Party since the time of Abraham Lincoln.|$|E

One of the Nationalist Envoys crashed in June 1937, killing General Emilio Mola.|$|R
50|$|The Democrats made a {{net gain}} of four Senate seats <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> Democrat John A.

50|$|Although a Democratic stronghold, Milwaukee {{receives}} {{a fair amount}} of attention <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> at <b>the</b> state and national levels during election years.
