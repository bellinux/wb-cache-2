5|$|Egg-laying {{takes two}} {{different}} forms {{depending on the}} species. The female in some families has a sharp-edged ovipositor with which she slits open a stem or leaf of a plant {{on or near the}} water, so she can push her eggs inside. In other families such as clubtails (Gomphidae), cruisers (Macromiidae), emeralds (Corduliidae), and skimmers (Libellulidae), the female lays eggs by tapping {{the surface of the water}} repeatedly with <b>her</b> <b>abdomen,</b> by shaking the eggs out of <b>her</b> <b>abdomen</b> as she flies along, or by placing the eggs on vegetation. In a few species, the eggs are laid on emergent plants above the water, and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of butterflies have a four-stage life cycle; egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis) and imago (adult). In the genera Colias, Erebia, Euchloe, and Parnassius, {{a small number of}} species are known that reproduce semi-parthenogenetically; when the female dies, a partially developed larva emerges from <b>her</b> <b>abdomen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Apart from pit-trap-forming taxa, {{the biology}} {{of members of the}} family Myrmeleontidae, to which the antlions belong, has been little studied. The {{life-cycle}} begins with oviposition (egg-laying) in a suitable location. The female antlion repeatedly taps the prospective laying site with the tip of <b>her</b> <b>abdomen</b> and then inserts her ovipositor into the substrate and lays an egg.|$|E

50|$|During {{a routine}} checkup in December 1998, her American doctors {{informed}} {{her of a}} small growth in <b>her</b> left <b>abdomen.</b> After a six-hour surgery, they found a malignant tumour in its fourth stage, and Díaz was given three months to live. She underwent another operation, and received chemotherapy for three months.|$|R

5|$|The {{longfin mako}} has large eyes and is {{attracted}} to cyalume sticks (chemical lights), implying {{that it is}} a visual hunter. Its diet consists mainly of small, schooling bony fishes and squids. In October 1972, a 3.4-m-long female with the broken bill from a swordfish (Xiphius gladias) lodged in <b>her</b> <b>abdomen</b> was caught in the northeastern Indian Ocean; whether the shark was preying on swordfish as the shortfin mako does, or encountered the swordfish in some other aggressive context is not known. Adult longfin makos have no natural predators except for killer whales, while young individuals may fall prey to larger sharks.|$|E
5|$|During the argument, {{a scuffle}} ensued between Pandey {{and the group}} of men. He was beaten, gagged and knocked {{unconscious}} with an iron rod. The men then dragged Jyoti {{to the rear of}} the bus, beating her with the rod and raping her while the bus driver continued to drive. Medical reports later said that she suffered serious injuries to <b>her</b> <b>abdomen,</b> intestines and genitals due to the assault, and doctors said that the damage indicated that a blunt object (suspected to be the iron rod) may have been used for penetration. That rod was later described by police as being a rusted, L-shaped implement of the type used as a wheel jack handle.|$|E
5|$|Coconut crabs mate {{frequently}} and quickly {{on dry land}} in the period from May to September, especially between early June and late August. Male coconut crabs have spermatophores and deposit a mass of spermatophores on the abdomen of the female; the abdomen opens {{at the base of}} the third pereiopods, and fertilisation is thought to occur on the external surface of the abdomen as the eggs pass through the spermatophore mass. The extrusion of eggs occurs on land in crevices or burrows near the shore. Shortly thereafter, the female lays her eggs and glues them to the underside of <b>her</b> <b>abdomen,</b> carrying the fertilised eggs underneath her body for a few months. At the time of hatching, the female coconut crab releases the eggs into the ocean. This usually takes place on rocky shores at dusk, especially when this coincides with high tide. The empty egg cases remain on the female's body after the larvae have been released, and the female eats the egg cases within a few days.|$|E

She was {{diagnosed}} with neuroblastoma having a malignant tumor in <b>her</b> right <b>abdomen.</b> After one-and-half-year-long chemotherapy and two surgeries, the tumor was removed. However, due to damaged nerves, she became paraplegic.|$|R

40|$|Injury of a {{pregnant}} lady risks {{both mother and}} fetus. Various modes of injuries are possible. But arrow injury is not usually heard of in today′s world. We have reported a male child delivered with a cut injury on the face. It {{was caused by a}} penetrating arrow hitting his mother in <b>her</b> lower <b>abdomen</b> at term. The injury of the baby was repaired successfully...|$|R
5|$|Females {{typically}} {{lay between}} {{four hundred and}} three thousand eggs. The eggs are often dropped {{onto the surface of}} the water; sometimes the female deposits them by dipping the tip of <b>her</b> <b>abdomen</b> into the water during flight, releasing a small batch of eggs each time, or deposits them in bulk while standing next to the water. In a few species, the female submerges and places the eggs among plants or in crevices underwater, but in general, they sink to the bottom. The incubation time is variable, depending at least in part on temperature, and may be anything from a few days to nearly a year. Eggs can go into a quiet dormant phase or diapause. The larval growth rate is also temperature-dependent, as is the number of moults. At anywhere between ten and fifty, these post-embryonic moults are more numerous in mayflies than in most other insect orders. The nymphal stage of mayflies may last from several months to several years, depending on species and environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{occurs during}} the winter months. Once a female quoll has been impregnated, the folds on <b>her</b> <b>abdomen</b> convert into a pouch that opens at the back. The {{gestation}} period is 21 days. A baby quoll, or pup, {{is the size of}} a grain of rice. Up to 18 quolls are born in each litter, but only six survive the first two weeks. The survivors stay in their mother's pouch for eight weeks, suckling on one of the mother's six teats for milk. During the ninth week, the pups venture out of the pouch and onto the mother's back, where they remain for six weeks. Quolls reaches maturity when they are one year old, and have a natural lifespan of between two and five years. A 2008 study of the pouches of tiger quolls reported the pouches' appearance' were reliable indicators of the quolls' reproductive status: during the follicular phase, pouches were found to be red and have many secretions. After ovulation, pouches became deep and wet. Researchers can use this information to determine where a female quoll is in her ovarian cycle, which is anticipated to be helpful in breeding management.|$|E
5|$|The {{mutilated}} body of {{the fourth}} woman, prostitute Annie Chapman, was discovered at about 6:00am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway {{in the back yard}} of 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields. Chapman had left her lodgings at 2am on the day she was murdered, with the intention of getting money from a client to pay her rent. Her throat was cut from left to right. She had been disembowelled, and her intestines had been thrown out of <b>her</b> <b>abdomen</b> over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. The pathologist, George Bagster Phillips, was of the opinion that the murderer must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6–8inches (15–20cm) long. However, the idea that the murderer possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts. As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens.|$|E
50|$|While {{pregnant}} with her daughter Caroline in 1956, Kelly was frequently photographed clutching a distinctive leather hand-bag manufactured by Hermès. The purse, or Sac à dépêches, was likely a shield to prevent <b>her</b> pregnant <b>abdomen</b> from being exposed to the prying eyes of the paparazzi. The photographs, however, popularized the purse and became so {{closely associated with the}} fashion icon that it would thereafter be known as the Kelly Bag.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction We {{report the}} case of a patient with a benign multicystic peritoneal {{mesothelioma}} and describe its appearance on computed tomography scans and ultrasonography, in correlation with gross clinical and pathological findings. Case presentation A 72 -year-old Caucasian woman presented to our emergency department with acute abdomen signs and symptoms. A clinical examination revealed a painful palpable mass in <b>her</b> left <b>abdomen.</b> Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography demonstrated the presence of a large cystic mass in <b>her</b> left upper <b>abdomen,</b> adjacent to <b>her</b> left hemidiaphragm. The lower border of the mass extended to the upper margin of her pelvis. A complete resection of the lesion was performed. Pathological analysis showed a benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma. Conclusions Benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare lesion with a non-specific appearance on imaging. Its diagnosis always requires pathological analysis. </p...|$|R

25|$|Egg-laying {{is done by}} {{bringing}} the abdomen close to the mouthparts where the pap is being held. The female holds her front legs up and open and appears {{to use them to}} touch <b>her</b> <b>abdomen.</b> Her antennae are completely still and her wings are closed during the operation. Then <b>her</b> <b>abdomen</b> begins to vibrate, and her sting is turned inside and out and folded backwards. During this process, the egg is expelled and placed directly on the pap that the female is holding in her mouth. She does not touch it with her legs at all. Then <b>her</b> <b>abdomen</b> relaxes and the female places the egg inside the cell. The average length of the eggs laid by L. vechti is 1.36mm, and ovarian eggs are considered ready to be laid once they reach 1.16mm.|$|E
25|$|It {{is likely}} that Elbe was intersex, {{although}} that has been disputed. Some reports indicate that she already had rudimentary ovaries in <b>her</b> <b>abdomen</b> and she may have had Klinefelter syndrome.|$|E

25|$|Ovid's Metamorphoses {{mentions}} that just before discovering Callisto's pregnancy, Diana washed {{her feet and}} then she and her attendants disrobed. Walter Liedtke {{points out that the}} nymph standing somewhat apart from the group, with her hands clenched in front of <b>her</b> <b>abdomen,</b> perhaps in contrast with the nymph showing devotion and fidelity by washing feet, may be Callisto. This scene would then illustrate part of that myth narrative, Liedtke asserts, although Wheelock states that the episode seems unrelated to the mood of the painting.|$|E
25|$|Romalis first {{observed}} {{the results of}} illegal abortions in 1960, {{when he was in}} medical school. He was assigned the case of a young woman who had died of a septic abortion after using a folk remedy slippery elm bark. It often contains spores of the bacteria that cause gas gangrene, which is what had killed the young woman. She developed an overwhelming infection. An autopsy showed multiple abscesses throughout her body, in <b>her</b> <b>abdomen,</b> liver, lungs, and brain. Romalis never forgot that case.|$|E
50|$|During {{and after}} pregnancy, a woman {{experiences}} body shape changes. After menopause, with the reduced production of estrogen by the ovaries, {{there is a}} tendency for fat to redistribute from a female's buttocks, hips and thighs to <b>her</b> waist or <b>abdomen.</b>|$|R

50|$|Males {{defend a}} small {{territory}} in a suitable breeding location beside water. They perch on emerging vegetation {{and engage in}} aerial circling with any encroaching male without contact actually being made. Several males may have overlapping territories. They also display by raising the blue tip of the abdomen. Copulation may last {{for an hour or}} more but the couple separate before egg-laying starts. The female lays the eggs individually in the stems of submerged water plants, sometimes with <b>her</b> whole <b>abdomen</b> under water.|$|R
25|$|The second {{victim of}} the {{explosion}} was local principal Priya Kapoor (Menik Gooneratne). Although, Gooneratne's exit had been reported seven days before the storyline began, viewers were initially left guessing as to whether Priya or Sonya would die. Sonya sustained a serious head injury when she was thrown off her feet during the explosion. She {{was rushed to the}} hospital unconscious and with a swelling in the brain. Meanwhile, Priya was trapped inside the marquee when the explosion took place and was crushed by a heavy pot plant that fell on <b>her</b> <b>abdomen.</b> Like Sonya, she was also unconscious and had internal bleeding. However, Priya's condition deteriorated and eventually her life support was switched off.|$|E
25|$|William Henry Bury (25 May 1859 – 24 April 1889) had {{recently}} moved to Dundee from the East End of London, when he strangled his wife Ellen Elliott, a former prostitute, on 4 February 1889. He inflicted extensive wounds to <b>her</b> <b>abdomen</b> after she was dead and packed the body into a trunk. On 10 February, Bury went to the local police and told them his wife had committed suicide. He was arrested, tried, found guilty of her murder, and hanged in Dundee. A link with the Ripper crimes was investigated by police, but Bury denied any connection, despite making a full confession to his wife's homicide. Nevertheless, the executioner, James Berry, promoted the idea that Bury was the Ripper.|$|E
25|$|During the {{elaborate}} mating dance, the male of some pseudoscorpion species pulls a female over a spermatophore previously laid upon a surface. In other species, the male also pushes the sperm into the female genitals using the forelegs. The female carries the fertilised {{eggs in a}} brood pouch attached to <b>her</b> <b>abdomen,</b> and the young ride on the mother {{for a short time}} after they hatch. Up to two dozen young are hatched in a single brood; there may be more than one brood per year. The young go through three molts {{over the course of several}} years before reaching adulthood. Adult pseudoscorpions live 2 to 3 years. They are active in the warm months of the year, overwintering in silken cocoons when the weather grows cold.|$|E

50|$|The {{life cycle}} of the stick insect begins when the female {{deposits}} her eggs through one of these methods of oviposition: she will either flick her egg to the ground by a movement of the ovipositor or <b>her</b> entire <b>abdomen,</b> carefully place the eggs in the axils of the host plant, bury them in small pits in the soil, or stick the eggs to a substrate, usually a stem or leaf of the food plant. A single female lays from 100 to 1,200 eggs after mating, depending on the species.|$|R
