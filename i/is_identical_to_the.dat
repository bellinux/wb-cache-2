5|$|Since {{they are}} morally equivalent, {{perhaps it is}} not {{surprising}} that the cure for political injustices <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cure for economic ones: namely, the institution of democracy in both economic and political spheres (Russell 1938:234).|$|E

The game adds sixteen vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The pennies of King William IV (18301837) {{are similar}} to those of his predecessor, also being {{engraved}} by William Wyon, based on a model by Sir Francis Chantrey. King William's head faces right, with the obverse inscribed GULIELMUS IIII DEI GRATIA, while the reverse <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> George IV penny. Pennies were minted in 1831, 1834 and 1837. An 1836 penny has been reported but not confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Adjectives are inflected in two declensions—{{indefinite}} and definite—and {{they must}} match the noun they modify in gender and number. The indefinite neuter and plural forms of an adjective are usually created {{by adding a}} suffix (-t or -a) to the common form of the adjective, e.g., en grön stol (a green chair), ett grönt hus (a green house), and gröna stolar ("green chairs"). The definite form of an adjective <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> indefinite plural form, e.g., den gröna stolen ("the green chair"), det gröna huset ("the green house"), and de gröna stolarna ("the green chairs").|$|E

5|$|Believed to {{have been}} {{introduced}} by Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud, although some sources, such as Abdel-Wahab, claim {{that it was in}} use three centuries earlier, the flag was rectangular in shape and divided into nine stripes, the middle one green and double the size of all other bands, while the others alternated between yellow and red. Featured {{in the center of the}} green stripe was the Zulfiqar, the legendary Islamic sword of Ali, with the blade in white and the hilt multicolored. The red and yellow stripes each contained five equidistant symbols, whose order was alternated between each stripe. These symbols were divided into two categories: one red six-sided star voided with a disk of a different color in the center—either a red star and green disk or a white star and blue disk—, and a large disk voided in its lower right by a small disk of different color, with the combination being either a small red disk within a larger blue disk or a small yellow disk within a larger red disk. The first yellow stripe contains three red stars and two blue disks. The second stripe, red in color, contains three green disksand two white stars. The third stripe (second yellow one) <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first, with the exception that the star in its center is white, while the fourth stripe (second white one) <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second stripe.|$|E
5|$|King of Pop is a {{compilation}} album by American recording artist Michael Jackson released in commemoration of Michael Jackson's 50th birthday. The album differs significantly {{in each country}} it was released because fan voting was employed to determine the songs for each country's version. The album's title comes from the title Jackson acquired approximately 20 years earlier. The album's launch was made public on June 20, 2008, with the official announcement of the Australian version. The first release came with the German edition (which <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Swiss edition) on August 22, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Knights of the Nine <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{gameplay}} of Oblivion; {{the basic}} design, maneuvers, and interfaces remain unchanged. As such, it is a fantasy-based role-playing adventure game. Players begin Oblivion by defining their character; deciding on its skill set, specialization, physical features, and race. Knights of the Nine {{is an example}} of open-ended-style gameplay: the main quest may be delayed or completely ignored as the player explores the game world, follows side quests, interacts with NPCs, and develops a character according to their taste. Furthering the goal of open-ended gameplay, Knights of the Nine, unlike Bethesda's prior content packs for Oblivion, begins with no explicit prodding towards the newly introduced content; players must seek out and find the game's quest without external aid.|$|E
5000|$|The 100 series pistols <b>were</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 70 series, {{but were}} briefly marketed in the United States as such {{in the late}} 1960s. The Model 100 was a [...]32 ACP with the longer, 150mm barrel and the grip frame of the [...]22 caliber model; apart from its weight of nearly a kilogram, the pistol's {{remaining}} attributes <b>are</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Model 74. Model 101 <b>was</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Model 71, and Model 102 <b>was</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> Model 76. This numbering scheme was dropped in the mid 1970s, when the original Model 70 designation was resumed.|$|R

5|$|The European/Australian release, Dark Conflict, <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North American release, Days of Ruin, {{in terms}} of the storyline, gameplay, and features. Several minor details {{distinguish}} each version, such as differences in the names of the factions, characters, chapter names and units, as well as significant dialogue changes. This is due to Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Europe receiving Japanese copies of the game to translate independently, resulting in unique versions for each region.|$|E
5|$|The Korean zodiac <b>is</b> <b>{{identical}}</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chinese one. The Vietnamese zodiac {{is almost}} identical to Chinese zodiac except the second animal is the Water Buffalo instead of the Ox, and the fourth animal is the Cat instead of the Rabbit. The Japanese have since 1873 celebrated {{the beginning of the}} new year on 1 January as per the Gregorian Calendar. The Thai zodiac begins, not at Chinese New Year, but either {{on the first day of}} fifth month in the Thai lunar calendar, or during the Songkran festival (now celebrated every 13–15 April), depending on the purpose of the use.|$|E
5|$|The L191 (also {{formerly}} {{called the}} SS191) is a tracer cartridge designed for easier bullet spotting in dim light. Combustible chemicals packed {{in the rear}} of the L191 projectile create a light trail visible up to 200m (219yd). The L191 has been manufactured with red and red-on-black tips. The performance and trajectory of the L191 <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> SS190. For this reason, it is also classified by the ATF as armor-piercing handgun ammunition, and its sale is currently restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers.|$|E

5|$|The Old Norse {{feminine}} proper noun Hel <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> name of {{the location}} over which she rules, Old Norse Hel. The word has cognates in all branches of the Germanic languages, including Old English hell (and thus Modern English hell), Old Frisian helle, Old Saxon hellia, Old High German hella, and Gothic halja. All forms ultimately derive from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic feminine noun *xaljō or *haljō ('concealed place, the underworld'). In turn, the Proto-Germanic form derives from the o-grade form of the Proto-Indo-European root *kel-, *kol-: 'to cover, conceal, save'.|$|E
5|$|The {{front of}} the head of the female in {{breeding}} plumage is yellow, gradually changing to olive green {{at the back of the}} head, except for the broad yellow rear brow, while the area between the eye and the bill is dark greenish grey, and the area around the ear is green. The head is surrounded by a broad yellow collar that includes the chin. The remainder of the female breeding plumage <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> male's.|$|E
5|$|When no {{porosity}} {{is allowed}} {{in a cast}} part then the pore-free casting process is used. It <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> standard process except oxygen is injected into the die before each shot to purge any air from the mold cavity. This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates gas porosity. An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be heat treated and welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys.|$|E

5|$|Jesus sits in {{judgement}} in {{the upper}} centre panel. He holds a lily {{in his right hand}} and a sword in his left, and sits on a rainbow extending across two panels, while his feet rest on a sphere. His right hand is raised in the act of blessing, his left hand lowered. These positions indicate the act of judgement; he is deciding if souls are to be sent to Heaven or Hell, his gestures echoing the direction and positioning of the scales held by the Archangel Michael beneath him. His palms are open, revealing the wounds sustained when they were nailed to the cross, while his cope gapes in places making visible the injury caused by the lance, which pours deep-red blood. Christ's face <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> representation in van der Weyden's Braque Triptych, completed just a few years later in 1452. Christ, placed so high in the pictorial space and spanning both registers, orchestrates the entirety of the inner panels. Whereas earlier Last Judgements might have seemed chaotic, here Christ brings a sense of order.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} from the vault on October 5, 2010 as the second of Disney's Diamond Editions, {{in the form of a}} three-disc Blu-ray Disc and DVD combination pack— the first release of Beauty and the Beast on home video in high-definition format. This edition consists of four versions of the film: the original theatrical version, an extended version, the New York Film Festival storyboard-only version, and a fourth iteration displaying the storyboards via picture-in-picture alongside the original theatrical version. Upon its first week of release, the Blu-ray sold 1.1 million units, topping the Blu-ray sales chart and finishing in third place on the combined Blu-ray and DVD sales chart for the week ending on October 10, 2010. It was the second best-selling Blu-ray of 2010, behind Avatar. A two-disc DVD edition was released on November 23, 2010. A five-disc combo pack, featuring Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray 2D, DVD and a digital copy, was released on October 4, 2011. The 3D combo pack <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original Diamond Edition, except for the added 3D disc and digital copy. The Blu-ray release went into the Disney Vault along with the two sequels on April 30, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the Bill Struth Main Stand is the Sandy Jardine Stand {{formerly}} known as the Govan Stand. It is a two-tier stand, similar in style to the two end stands, which was completed in 1981. To the rear of the Govan Stand is the Argyle House extension, completed in 1990, which provides executive boxes, hospitality areas and office space. The Bar 72 area was added to the rear section of the Govan Stand in 2006. The Copland Road Stand, at the east end of the stadium, was completed in 1979 and now accommodates just over 8,000 fans. It is traditionally the 'Rangers end' of the ground and the team normally chooses to attack that end {{in the second half of}} matches. The western Broomloan Road Stand, which was completed in 1980, <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opposite end. Although constructed as separate structures, the three stands have been linked since the mid-1990s, when two additional areas of seating were added to the corner areas. All of the stands are designed using the 'goalpost' structure, in which a large portal frame supports perpendicular beams on which roof cladding is secured. A Rangers Megastore is located in the corner between the Copland Road and Govan Stands.|$|E
