Due to the high initial and running costs of the <b>DC</b> <b>machines,</b> the trend shifted from DC to AC motor drives to obtain high performance variable speed drives. The major achievement with {{field oriented control}} was the decoupled and independent control of stator and rotor quantities like <b>DC</b> <b>machines.</b> It is agreed that the control scheme for ac machines is complicated as compared to <b>DC</b> <b>machines.</b> The inherited problem with the ac machine control is the nonlinear relation between process variables e. g. speed and manipulated variables e. g. current, torque etc. Moreover, magnetic saturation of its rotor core causes developed torque relation of nonlinear nature...|$|R

50|$|With {{its origins}} in wound rotor {{induction}} motors with multiphase winding sets on the rotor and stator, respectively, that was invented by Nikola Tesla in 1888, the rotor winding set of the doubly-fed electric machine is connected to a selection of resistors via multiphase slip rings for starting. However, the slip power {{was lost in the}} resistors. Thus means to increase the efficiency in variable speed operation by recovering the slip power were developed. In Krämer (or Kraemer) drives the rotor was connected to an AC and <b>DC</b> <b>machine</b> set that fed a <b>DC</b> <b>machine</b> connected to the shaft of the slip ring machine. Thus the slip power was returned as mechanical power and the drive could be controlled by the excitation currents of the DC machines. The drawback of the Krämer drive is that the machines need to be overdimensioned in order to cope with the extra circulating power. This drawback was corrected in the Scherbius drive where the slip power is fed back to the AC grid by motor generator sets.|$|E

50|$|The diagram shows three {{arrangements}} of a metadyne machine. In all cases, compensation windings have been omitted for clarity. The first arrangement represents a one-cycle cross-field machine. In a normal <b>DC</b> <b>machine,</b> {{the effect of}} the excitation current generates a flux (A1), which in turn generates a quadrature flux which is at right angles to the exciting flux. By wiring the quadrature brushes together, current is produced in the armature, and the flux that this produces (A2) is again at right angles to the quadrature axis, resulting in an armature reaction which is directly opposed to the original excitation. This feature is fundamental to the machine, and does not depend on its direction of rotation. When the armature reaction is partially compensated by a compensation winding, the uncompensated portion of the armature reaction acts in this way. As the output current rises, it suppresses {{the effect of the}} excitation, until it reaches a state where there is just enough excitation to maintain the current. Any further increase would eliminate the flux which sustains its operation, and the current is maintained irrespective of the resistance of the load or the back emf produced by it. The machine thus acts as a constant-current generator, where the current is proportional to the excitation.|$|E

Though a mature technology, <b>DC</b> <b>machines</b> still require research attention to accomodate for heavier loads and harder operation conditions dictated by production needs. Recent advances in sensoring, data acquisition and signal processing technologies allow for direct measurement of quantities {{that used to be}} theoretically modeled or indirectly measured in the past.

A variety of valuable information about the motor performance can be derived from these measurements. This paper focuses on one particular aspect of the commutation performance of <b>DC</b> <b>machines,</b> namely, the magnitudes and uniformity of current density through a brush, which to a large degree dictate wear rates of the DC motor commutating group.
