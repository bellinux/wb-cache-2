25|$|Lace making {{has been}} {{prevalent}} in Malta since the 16th century, and was probably {{introduced to the}} Islands {{at roughly the same}} time as in Genoa. Lace was included with other articles in a bando or proclamation enacted by Grand Master Ramon Perellos y Roccaful in 1697, aimed at repressing the wearing of gold, silver, jewellery, <b>gold</b> <b>cloth,</b> silks and other materials of value.|$|E

25|$|In June 1699 Kidd {{was stopped}} on the island while sailing to Boston to try to clear his name. With the {{permission}} of the proprietor, Mrs. Gardiner, he buried $30,000 in treasure in a ravine between Bostwick's Point and the Manor House. For her troubles he gave her a piece of <b>gold</b> <b>cloth</b> (a piece of which is now at the East Hampton library) that was captured from a Moorish ship off Madagascar, as well as a bag of sugar. Kidd warned that if it was not there when he returned he would kill Gardiner. Kidd was tried in Boston and Gardiner was ordered to deliver the treasure as evidence. The booty included gold dust, bars of silver, Spanish dollars, rubies, diamonds, candlesticks and porringers. Gardiner kept one of the diamonds, which he gave his daughter. A plaque on the island marks the spot, but it's on private property.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the battle, the Audley family claimed to have lost £300 of goods: seven cartloads of <b>gold</b> <b>cloth,</b> silver vessels and chapel ornaments from Heleigh Castle. [...] These had been ordered to be removed to Tutbury Priory by Peter de Lymesey, but according to the prior they never arrived and were taken to Tutbury Castle and subsequently lost in the retreat of the Lancastrians from Burton. [...] Burton Abbey also suffered damage {{at the hands of the}} Lancastrian forces.|$|E
2500|$|The Sagittarius <b>Gold</b> <b>Cloth</b> {{was chosen}} as the most famous of the Gold Cloths because of its {{symbolism}} in relation to the main character. The Japanese meaning of Seiya's name, [...] "star arrow", is also a metaphor for [...] "meteor" [...] and Sagittarius represents an archer, so Kurumada {{thought it would be a}} perfect match for Seiya, especially since he already had in mind that Seiya would eventually wear the Sagittarius <b>Gold</b> <b>Cloth</b> in certain parts. Hence, Seiya's zodiacal sign is Sagittarius.|$|E

2500|$|A {{conversion}} {{occurs when}} a person does such acts {{in reference to the}} personal property of another as amount, in view of the law, to his appropriating the property for himself. The action probably developed because there was no equivalent form of action in English law to the Roman law rei vindicatio. This was an action in protection of one's property, whereby a claimant could simply allege in court [...] "that's mine!". Early cases of conversion {{are to be found in}} 1479, where reference to an even earlier action on the case is made when the defendant [...] "converted" [...] the goods by changing their character, making clothes out of <b>gold</b> <b>cloth.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1902 Lord Curzon {{organized}} the Delhi Durbar {{to celebrate the}} coronation of King Edward VII, [...] "the grandest pageant in history", which created a tremendous sensation. At the state ball Mary wore an extravagant coronation gown, by the House of Worth of Paris, known as Lady Curzon's peacock dress, stitched of <b>gold</b> <b>cloth</b> embroidered with peacock feathers with a blue/green beetle wing in each eye, which many mistook for emeralds, tapping into their own fantasies about the wealth of millionaire heiresses, Indian potentates and European royalty. The skirt was trimmed with white roses and the bodice with lace. She wore a huge diamond necklace and a large brooch of diamonds and pearls. She wore a tiara crown with a pearl tipping each of its high diamond points. It was reported that as she walked through the hall the crowd was breathless. This dress is now {{on display at the}} Curzon estate, Kedleston Hall.|$|E
2500|$|The main throne room {{is located}} inside the {{audience}} chamber. According to a contemporary account by envoy Cornelius Duplicius de Schepper in 1533: [...] "The Emperor was {{seated on a}} slightly elevated throne completely covered with <b>gold</b> <b>cloth,</b> replete and strewn with numerous precious stones, and there were on all sides many cushions of inestimable value; {{the walls of the}} chamber were covered with mosaic works spangled with azure and gold; the exterior of the fireplace of this chamber of solid silver and covered with gold, and at one side of the chamber from a fountain water gushed forth from a wall." [...] The present throne {{in the form of a}} baldachin was made on the order of Mehmed III. On the lacquered ceiling of the throne, studded with jewels, are foliage patterns accompanied by the depiction of the fight of a dragon, symbol of power, with simurg, a mythical bird. On the throne there is a cover made of several pieces of brocade on which emerald and ruby plaques and pearls are sown.|$|E

50|$|Only the costliest {{clothes of}} cotton, silk or wool were used. In the zenana, there were {{multiple}} costume changes a day, and often an outfit would be worn only {{once and then}} given away. The garments themselves were very thin, weighing less than an ounce each, with gold lace added and “muslin so fine as to be almost transparent.” This {{may account for the}} breasts occasionally seen in Mughal miniature painting. The head was covered with <b>gold</b> <b>cloths</b> or turbans with feathers. Long gowns (qaba) or kashmiri shawl were used in cold weather. Jamawars were suits of wool with flowers interwoven with wool or silk. Patterned and bejeweled shoes, with distinctively sharp upward curling points and worn down heels were fashionable.|$|R

Consecrated water was poured over the royal couple and fell on the animals below. Then, having been bathed, they entered the Singarighar and took their seats on a throne. The leading nobles came up and offered their presents and homage. New money was coined, and gratuities were given to the principal officers of the state and to religious mendicants. The presents to the officers consisted of gold earrings, gold bangles and <b>gold</b> embroidered <b>cloths.</b> Deodhai-Bailungs were offered <b>gold</b> earrings, embroidered <b>cloths,</b> girdles, and long clocks, and silver, <b>gold,</b> cowries and <b>cloths</b> to the children and the people at large. On that day, prisoners convicted with minor crimes were released. The king and his chief queen stayed in the Singarighar for one full day and night.|$|R
60|$|The {{cries and}} wailings {{of the poor}} resounded all night around the house, and Serfojee Rajah came from a {{distance}} to be present at his burial. It had been intended to sing a funeral hymn, but the cries and lamentations of the poor so overcame the clergy, that they could scarcely raise their voices. Serfojee wept bitterly, laid a <b>gold</b> <b>cloth</b> over the bier, and remained present while Mr. Gericke read the Funeral Service,--a most unusual departure from Hindoo custom, and a great testimony of affection and respect.|$|E
6000|$|We waited, breathless. The chief Lama {{approached}} the altar before the recess, {{in front of}} the great cross-legged, vapidly smiling Buddha. He bowed himself to the ground three times over, as well as his portly frame would permit him, knocking his forehead against the floor, just as Hilda had done; then he proceeded, almost awestruck, to take from the altar an object wrapped round with gold brocade, and very carefully guarded. Two acolytes accompanied him. In the most reverent way, he slowly unwound the folds of <b>gold</b> <b>cloth,</b> and released from its hiding-place the highly sacred deposit. He held it up before our eyes with an air of triumph. It was an English bottle! ...|$|E
6000|$|Midas started up, {{in a kind}} of joyful frenzy, and ran {{about the}} room, {{grasping}} at everything that happened to be in his way. He seized one of the bed-posts, and it became immediately a fluted golden pillar. He pulled aside a window-curtain, in order to admit a clear spectacle of the wonders which he was performing; and the tassel grew heavy in his hand,--a mass of gold. He took up a book from the table. At his first touch, it assumed the appearance of such a splendidly bound and gilt-edged volume as one often meets with, nowadays; but, on running his fingers through the leaves, behold! it was a bundle of thin golden plates, in which all the wisdom of the book had grown illegible. He hurriedly put on his clothes, and was enraptured to see himself in a magnificent suit of <b>gold</b> <b>cloth,</b> which retained its flexibility and softness, although it burdened him a little with its weight. He drew out his handkerchief, which little Marygold had hemmed for him. That was likewise gold, with the dear child's neat and pretty stitches running all along the border, in gold thread! ...|$|E

50|$|Although Tibetan {{forces were}} {{fighting}} the Chinese between 799 and 803, with battles in Yanzhou, Linzhou, Weizhou, Yazhou and Suizhou, envoys began travelling regularly from 804 onwards between Lhasa and China, although no formal treaty was signed.

60|$|It was a throne-room, {{used for}} the {{reception}} of foreign ambassadors, when the King, which of late had not been often, consented {{to give them a}} personal audience; the same room in which, many years before, envoys had appeared from England to make arrangements for the marriage of their Queen, then one of the Catholic sovereigns of Europe, with the Emperor's eldest son. The hangings were of gilt Cordovan leather, and a heavy gilt chandelier with branches for three hundred wax lights hung down from the black and white ceiling. Underneath a great canopy of <b>gold</b> <b>cloth,</b> on which the lions and towers of Castile were broidered in seed pearls, stood the throne itself, covered with a rich pall of black velvet studded with silver tulips and elaborately fringed with silver and pearls. On the second step of the throne was placed the kneeling-stool of the Infanta, with its cushion of cloth of silver tissue, and below that again, and beyond the limit of the canopy, stood the chair for the Papal Nuncio, who alone had the right to be seated in the King's presence on the occasion of any public ceremonial, and whose Cardinal's hat, with its tangled scarlet tassels, lay on a purple tabouret in front. On the wall, facing the throne, hung a life-sized portrait of Charles V. in hunting dress, with a great mastiff by his side, and a picture of Philip II. receiving the homage of the Netherlands occupied the centre of the other wall. Between the windows stood a black ebony cabinet, inlaid with plates of ivory, on which the figures from Holbein's Dance of Death had been graved--by the hand, some said, of that famous master himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord the dwarf," [...] said Alcahazar, {{advancing}} toward him, [...] "I am {{the king}} of a far country; and passing your castle, and hearing of your feast, I have made bold to come and offer {{you some of the}} sweet-tasting birds of my kingdom." [...] So saying, he lifted up his richly embroidered cloak, and took from under it a great silver dish containing about two hundred dozen hot, smoking, delicately cooked, fat little birds. Under the dish were fastened lamps of perfumed oil, all lighted, and keeping the savory food nice and hot. Making a low bow, the magician placed the dish before the dwarf, who tasted one of the birds, and immediately clapped his hands with joy. [...] "Great King!" [...] he cried, [...] "welcome to my feast! Slaves, quick! make room for the great king!" [...] As there was no vacant place, the slaves took hold of one of the guests, and gave him what the boys would call a [...] "hist," [...] right through the window, and Alcahazar took his place. Then stepped forward Ormanduz, and said, [...] "My lord the dwarf, I am also {{the king of}} a far country, and I have made bold to offer you some of the wine of my kingdom." [...] So saying, he lifted his gold-lined cloak, and took from beneath it a crystal decanter, covered with gold and ruby ornaments, with one hundred and one beautifully carved silver goblets hanging from its neck, and which contained about eleven gallons of the most delicious wine. He placed it before the dwarf, who, having tasted the wine, gave a great cheer, and shouted to his slaves to make room for this mighty king. So the slaves took another guest by the neck and heels, and sent him, slam-bang, through the window, and Ormanduz took his place. Then stepped forward Mahallah, and said, [...] "My lord the dwarf, I am also the king of a far country, and I bring you a sample of the venison of my kingdom." [...] So saying, he raised his velvet cloak, trimmed with diamonds, and took from under it a whole deer, already cooked, and stuffed with oysters, anchovies, buttered toast, olives, tamarind seeds, sweet-marjoram, sage, and many other herbs and spices, and all piping hot, and smelling deliciously. This he put down before the dwarf, who, when he had tasted it, waved his goblet over his head, and cried out to the slaves to make room for this mighty king. So the slaves seized another guest, and out of the window, like a shot, he went, and Mahallah took his place. Then Akbeck stepped up, and said, [...] "My lord the dwarf, I am also the king of a far country, and I bring you some of the confections of my dominions." [...] So saying, he took from under his cloak of <b>gold</b> <b>cloth,</b> a great basket of silver filagree work, in which were cream-chocolates, and burnt almonds, and sponge-cake, and lady's fingers, and mixtures, and gingernuts, and hoar-hound candy, and gum-drops, and fruit-cake, and cream candy, and mintstick, and pound-cake, and rock candy, and butter taffy, and many other confections, amounting in all to about two hundred and twenty pounds. He placed the basket before the dwarf, who tasted some of these good things, and found them so delicious, that he lay on his back and kicked up his heels in delight, shouting to his slaves to make room for this great king. As the next guest was a big, fat man, too heavy to throw far, he was seized by four slaves, who walked him Spanish right out of the door, and Akbeck took his place. Then Zamcar stepped forward and said, [...] "My lord the dwarf, I also am king of a far country, and I bring you some of the fruit of my dominions." [...] And so saying, he took from beneath his gold and purple cloak, a great basket filled with currants as big as grapes, and grapes as big as plums, and plums as big as peaches, and peaches as big as cantaloupes, and cantaloupes as big as water-melons, and water-melons as big as barrels. There were about nineteen bushels of them altogether, and he put them before the dwarf, who, having tasted some of them, clapped his hands, and shouted to his slaves to make room for this mighty king; but as the next guest had very sensibly got up and gone out, Zamcar took his seat without any delay. Then Ting-a-ling, who was very much excited by all these wonderful performances, slipped down out of Zamcar's turban, and, running up towards the dwarf, cried out, [...] "My lord the dwarf, I am also the king of a far country, and I bring you"--and he lifted up his little cloak; but as there was nothing there, he said no more, but clambered up into Zamcar's turban again. As nobody noticed or heard him, so great was the bustle and noise of the festivity, his speech made no difference one way or the other. After everybody had eaten and drunk until they could eat and drink no more, the dwarf jumped up and called to the chief butler, to know how many beds were prepared for the guests; to which the butler answered that there were thirty beds prepared. [...] "Then," [...] said the dwarf, [...] "give these five noble kings each one of the best rooms, with a down bed, and a silken comfortable; and give the other beds to the twenty-five biggest guests. As to the rest, turn them out!" [...] So the dwarf went to bed, and each of the magicians had a splendid room, and twenty-five of the biggest guests had beds, and the rest were all turned out. As it was pouring down rain, and freezing, and cold, and wet, and slippery (for the weather was very unsettled on this mountain), and all these guests, who now found themselves outside of the castle gates, lived many miles away, and as none of them had any hats, or knew the way home, they were very miserable indeed.|$|E
