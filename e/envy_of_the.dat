5|$|Despite {{being more}} popular than some men's {{football}} events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd), women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, {{on the grounds that}} the game (as played by women) was distasteful. Some speculated that this may have also been due to <b>envy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large crowds that women's matches attracted. This led to the formation of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.|$|E

5|$|To silence Luna, Aguinaldo {{appointed}} him as Chief of War Operations on 26 September 1898, and assigned {{the rank of}} brigadier general. In quick succession, he was made the Director or Assistant Secretary of War and Supreme Chief of the Republican Army on 28 September, arousing the <b>envy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other generals who were fighting since {{the first phase of}} the Revolution. Meanwhile, Luna felt that bureaucratic placebos were being thrown his way, when all he wanted was to organize and discipline the enthusiastic but ill-fed and ill-trained troops into a real army.|$|E
5|$|Ancient lore {{states that}} Vana'diel was {{created as a}} {{playground}} for the Gods and their children, who themselves were spawned from an enormous and sentient Crystal. Eventually wishing to be one with the Gods, the children constructed a pathway to paradise. They were smote down for their insolence, however, and their cities cast {{to the bottom of}} the sea. After seeing the destruction of her children and filled with sadness, the Goddess Altana wept five tears that gave life to the five Enlightened Races of Vana'diel. The God of Twilight, Promathia, condemned her weakness, however, and the life that arose from it. Promathia cursed the five races with eternal conflict amongst themselves by bringing forth their darkest attributes: the apathy of the Humes, the arrogance of the Elvaan, the rage of the Galka, the cowardice of the Tarutaru, and the <b>envy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mithra. He created the Beastmen, commanding them to forever fight the people of Vana'diel and occupy their minds, so these children would never have time to group together and construct a pathway like the ones before them. The creation lore's sentient Crystal, Gods, Children, and the truths behind them feature as major plot points in several Final Fantasy XI expansion packs, while the Beastmen are some of the game's main antagonists.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is given}} Michael's client list as a going-away present, {{much to the}} shock and <b>envy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other salesmen, and after losing one, {{requests}} the help of Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) to retain them. Vickers nearly ruins {{a relationship with a}} client but Andy gains enough confidence to salvage the sale. Along the way, Vickers reveals that he was not hired for his business experience, but because he helped prevent the theft of one of Sabre CEO Jo Bennett's dogs. Meanwhile, Dwight (Rainn Wilson) is antagonistic towards Michael, still bitter over Michael not recommending him for a manager position, despite Michael's attempts to reconcile. He initially expresses disdain for Michael's going-away present, a recommendation letter, but appears touched as he reads further. He also discovers a card challenging him to a paintball match, and the two play behind the building.|$|E

Starting with a bold plan begun in the 1980 s to connect the city to its waterfront, Vancouver has spent the following decades on a transformation spree that is <b>the</b> <b>envy</b> <b>of</b> urbanists <b>the</b> world over.

5|$|The {{unitary state}} {{was not an}} end in itself, but a means to higher ends. The {{republic}} had been in dire financial straits even before the revolution of 1795. The system of public finance {{that had been the}} <b>envy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world in its Golden Age, enabling it to throw far beyond its weight in world politics up to the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, had become a millstone around its neck. By 1713 the public debt of the province of Holland had reached 310 million guilders; the debt of the Generality was 68 million; and the debts of the smaller provinces, and of the cities came on top of this. The debt service of Holland alone in that year required 14 million guilders, which exceeded its regular tax revenue. Most of this humongous public debt was held by Dutch private citizens, so in a sense it merely engendered an internal money circuit in the Dutch economy. However, it was mostly concentrated {{in the hands of the}} rentier class, while the debt was serviced by mainly regressive taxes that weighed on the working population. Most importantly, these were taxes levied by the individual provinces, who serviced their own debt, and paid into the Generality coffers according to a repartition schedule last changed in 1616. Attempts to reform this structure during the 18th century were mainly fruitless.|$|E

50|$|By the 17th century, {{the abbey}} had become rich {{from years of}} gifts, legacies, and {{productive}} agriculture.

25|$|In 312 AD, Emperor Constantine {{visited the}} region where his orator {{described}} the turmoil that the region endures in cultivating vine.

Taking the wine down from the côte in fragile wood barrels was a treacherous ordeal along the potholed filled roads of the region, with many barrels being broken and lost along the way. The orator also described a scene of tangled old vines and knotted roots dotted along the vineyard, a likely sign that the ancient Burgundians practiced the vine propagation method of provignage or layering.|$|E

According to Martello's account, Concetta had worked as a folk magician and tarot card reader, and attracted the hatred and <b>envy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local Catholic clergy. He also related that on one occasion, she had killed a Mafioso using magic when he threatened her husband for not paying protection money. Martello related that when he was 16, his father told him that he had cousins in New York City who wished to meet him. He proceeded to do so and [...] according to his account [...] they informed him that they were initiates of an ancient Italian witchcraft religion, La Vecchia ("the Old Religion").
