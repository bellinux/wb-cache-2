5|$|In literature, Portsmouth is {{the chief}} {{location}} for Jonathan Meades' 1993 novel Pompey, {{in which it is}} inhabited largely by incestuous and necrophiliac criminals. Since the release of his novel, Meades has presented a TV programme documenting Victorian architecture in Portsmouth Dockyard. In Jane Austen's novel Mansfield Park, Portsmouth is the hometown of the main character Fanny Price, and is the setting of most of the closing chapters of the novel. In Charles Dickens' novel The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby, main protagonists Nicholas and Smike make their way to Portsmouth and <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> theatrical troupe. In Patrick O'Brian's nautical historical Aubrey-Maturin series, Portsmouth is most often the port from which Captain Jack Aubrey's ships sail.|$|E
5|$|On Enterprise, {{analysis}} of data gathered in the previous encounter with the Romulan ship reveals that the ship is being piloted telepathically by an Andorian. Commander Shran (Jeffrey Combs) explains that the data indicates that the pilot is probably {{a member of the}} Aenar, a white-skinned and blind Andorian sub-race. This, however, seems unlikely, since the Aenar are few in number, reclusive pacifists, and inhabitants of the isolated extreme northern polar region of their moon. Shran and Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) then beam down to contact the Aenar. The Aenar's spokesperson, Lissan (Alicia Adams), initially declines to assist as the Aenar do not want to <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> war. However, a young Aenar named Jhamel (Alexandra Lydon) decides to help, since doing so may help locate Gareb (Scott Allen Rinker), her missing brother.|$|E
5|$|Fearing that Darvin may be {{attempting}} to assassinate Kirk, the crew dress in period uniforms and investigate the Enterprise. They attempt {{to interact with}} history {{as little as possible}} whilst investigating Darvin. The crew does not initially recognize the Klingons of the time period, and when Worf (Michael Dorn) is asked about the difference in appearance, he replies that the matter is not discussed with outsiders. Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) and Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bar brawl between the Enterprise crew and a number of Klingons on shore leave. Captain Kirk disciplines them on the Enterprise alongside Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott (James Doohan) and Ensign Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig). Bashir and O'Brien notice that the ship is covered with tribbles. Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) and Odo (Ren√© Auberjonois) detain Darvin and return him to the Defiant. There, Darvin admits that he planted a bomb in a tribble to kill Kirk.|$|E

5|$|She portrayed {{a wealthy}} {{university}} patron in Chen Shi-zheng's much-delayed feature drama Dark Matter, {{a film about}} a Chinese science graduate student who becomes violent after dealing with academic politics at a U.S. university. Inspired {{by the events of}} the 1991 University of Iowa shooting, and initially scheduled for a 2007 release, producers and investors decided to shelve Dark Matter out of respect for the Virginia Tech massacre in April 2007. The drama received negative to mixed reviews upon its limited 2008 release. Streep played a U.S. government official who investigates an Egyptian foreign national suspected of terrorism in the political thriller Rendition (2007), directed by Gavin Hood. Keen to <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> thriller film, Streep welcomed the opportunity to star in a film genre for which she was not usually offered scripts and immediately signed on to the project. Upon its release, Rendition was less commercially successful, and received mixed reviews.|$|E

25|$|In 1990 Gordon met Hugh Connerty, {{who owned}} some Hooters {{restaurants}} {{and was also}} a partner in Outback Steakhouse. Connerty secured some sponsorship for a car through Outback, and they tested {{for the last few}} Busch Grand National races left in 1990. Ray Evernham was called in to work with Gordon in his stock car debut. His first Busch race came on October 20, 1990 at North Carolina Motor Speedway in the AC-Delco 200. Gordon drove the No. 67 Outback Steakhouse Pontiac for Connerty. Gordon ran the second fastest lap during qualifying and started {{on the outside of the}} front row of the field. Gordon would however, <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wreck on lap 33. He ended up with a 39th-place finish.|$|E
25|$|At Atlanta, Earnhardt Jr. {{came home}} with another third-place finish and at Las Vegas, he {{finished}} fourth, scoring his third Top 5 finish after taking two tires during green flag pit-stops with 30 laps to go. At Phoenix, he had his worst finish of the year, with a last place finish after a tire-blowout. At Auto Club, he finished 6th. At Martinsville, he also ran inside the Top 20 until a tire-blowout made him <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> massive pileup that destroyed {{the front end of}} his car. Because of this crash, he would go on to finish 36th. At Texas, he narrowly was beaten by Kevin Harvick for second place. At Bristol, he ran as high as third until a loose wheel put him down two laps down. Although he never got them back, he was able to bring home a 16th-place finish only two laps down. At Richmond, he ran in the Top 10 all day until he and Tony Stewart made contact but managed to finish 14th.|$|E

500|$|On 2 March 2007, Paul Joyal, {{a former}} {{director}} of security for the U.S. Senate intelligence committee, who the previous weekend alleged on national television that the Kremlin was involved in the poisoning of Litvinenko, was shot near his Maryland home. An FBI spokesman said the agency was [...] "assisting" [...] the police investigation into the shooting. Police would not confirm details of the shooting or of the condition of Joyal. A person familiar with the case said he was in critical condition in hospital. It was reported that while there were no indications that the shooting was linked to the Litvinenko case, it is unusual for the FBI to <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> local shooting incident. A person familiar with the situation said NBC had hired bodyguards for some of the journalists involved in the program.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said he [...] "started out liking this movie, {{while waiting}} for {{something}} really interesting to happen. When nothing did, I still didn't dislike it; I assume the X-Men will further develop their personalities {{if there is a}} sequel, and maybe find time to <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> story. No doubt fans of the comics will understand subtle allusions and fine points of behavior; they should linger in the lobby after each screening to answer questions." [...] He also gave it a [...] "thumbs down" [...] on Ebert & Roeper. [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone noted, [...] "Since it's Wolverine's movie, any X-Men or Women who don't hinge directly on his story get short shrift. As Storm, Halle Berry can do neat tricks with weather, but her role is gone with the wind. It sucks that Stewart and McKellen, two superb actors, are underused." ...|$|E

500|$|Dan the Automator {{criticized the}} release, stating [...] "That wasn't a Dr. Octagon record. Dr. Octagon is me, Kool Keith, and Q-Bert. The label didn't have {{the legal right}} to use the name, but I didn't want to <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> legal battle...Keith's my man, just trying to make a little bit of money." [...] KutMasta Kurt stated that Thornton was {{reluctant}} to perform songs from the album, because the lyrics did not fit the music. John Lindland, who coproduced the final album under the name One-Watt Sun, stated in defense of the album, [...] "People say it's a fake. We don't have that feeling. We think that those are great tracks. It wasn't about remixing anything. They were our ideas, and Keith went on grooves that we sent to LA." [...] In response to Fanatik J's criticism of the album, One Watt Sun referred to him as being disgruntled {{as a result of the}} label discarding his music. According to Lindland, [...] "If we were him, we'd have [...] beef too".|$|E
500|$|During {{their one}} week of training, the band {{performs}} consistently badly and fails to improve at all. [...] Patrick and Sandy {{get into a}} fight when Patrick kicks Sandy and, as a result, Sandy sticks him up a trombone. On the second day, while practicing a march, two flag twirlers are killed when they spin the flags too fast (because Squidward scolded them to spin the flags faster), causing them to fly {{into the air and}} crash into a blimp. On day three, Plankton plays his harmonica, but becomes exhausted and collapses from running back and forth, since the harmonica is bigger than he is. On the last day of practice, Squidward says if everyone plays loud, they will be good. However, they play poorly, and Squidward changes the plan of playing loud to quiet. A fish becomes annoyed, saying [...] "Well maybe we wouldn't sound so bad if some people didn't try to play with big, meaty, claws!" [...] Mr. Krabs is angered by him and attacks, causing everyone to <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> huge brawl, smashing the instruments and hurting each other, causing the band to break up. A grieving Squidward expresses his disappointment in all of them and goes home in distress over his failure.|$|E
2500|$|In Sweeney! (1977), Regan and Carter <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> plot {{based on}} the Profumo Affair. British actor Barry Foster guest-stars as an Americanised, and more deadly, version of Stephen Ward. Made in 1976, the film appears to be set in the then near-future, {{indicated}} by the line [...] "The same damned speech you made in 1978."; also visible on a wall in the scene where the OPEC delegates meet is a logo displaying [...] "1979".|$|E

2500|$|His {{faith as}} a Christian Scientist, which {{was said to}} be [...] "unshakable", led Edwards to <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{prolonged}} dispute over whether Christian Science 'nurses' should be able to use that title despite not being State Registered Nurses. In 1945 he strongly opposed Conservative MP Hugh Linstead's motion to prevent them doing so, arguing that the Christian Science nurses did not compete with other nurses. When the Ministry of Health acquired the power to control the title 'nurse', he moved his own motion to allow the Christian Science use to continue, arguing that it had been stopped through a loophole in the law.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Barnett, who was {{a senior}} {{official}} at the UN at that time, has provided evidence that the UN's Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) failed {{to pass on to}} the Security Council information that could have bolstered a case for intervention. This information included the location of Interhamwe arms caches and information preceding the genocide that the Interhamwe were compiling {{a list of all the}} Tutsis in Kigali. The informer was Jean-Pierre Twatzinze, who has been asked to compile the list. According to Barnett, UN inaction stemmed from its desire not to <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> potentially PR-risky operation which could damage the prospects for future peacebuilding operations, given that 18 UN troops had recently been killed in Somalia, even though UN troops had the capacity to save thousands of lives. [...] "For many at the UN", Barnett writes, the moral compass pointed [...] "away from and not toward Rwanda." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, Diamond {{switched}} labels again, {{returning to}} Columbia Records for a million-dollar-advance-per-album contract (US$ in [...] dollars). His first project, released {{as a solo}} album, was the soundtrack to Hall Bartlett's film version of Jonathan Livingston Seagull. The film received hostile reviews and did poorly at the box office, and the album grossed more than the film did. Richard D. Bach, {{author of the best-selling}} source story, disowned the film, and both he and Diamond sued director Bartlett, though for differing reasons; in Bach's case, it was because he felt the film omitted too much from the original novella, whereas in Diamond's case, it was because he felt the film had butchered his score. [...] "After 'Jonathan,'" [...] Diamond declared, [...] "I vowed never to <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> movie again unless I had complete control." [...] Bartlett angrily responded to Diamond's lawsuit by criticizing his music as having become [...] "too slick...and it's not as much from his heart as it used to be." [...] However, Bartlett also added, [...] "Neil is extraordinarily talented. Often his arrogance is just a cover for the lonely and insecure person underneath." ...|$|E
