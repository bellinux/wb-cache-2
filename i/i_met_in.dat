500|$|When {{asked what}} {{led him to}} write a novel {{centered}} on two Afghan women, Hosseini responded:"I had been entertaining the idea of writing a story of Afghan women for some time after I'd finished writing The Kite Runner. That first novel was a male-dominated story. All the major characters, except perhaps for Amir's wife Soraya, were men. There was a whole facet of Afghan society which I hadn't touched on in The Kite Runner, an entire landscape that I felt was fertile with story ideas...In the spring of 2003, I went to Kabul, and I recall seeing these burqa-clad women sitting at street corners, with four, five, six children, begging for change. I remember watching them walking in pairs up the street, trailed by their children in ragged clothes, and wondering how life had brought them to that point...I spoke to many of those women in Kabul. Their life stories were truly heartbreaking...When I began writing A Thousand Splendid Suns, I found myself thinking about those resilient women over and over. Though no one woman that <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>in</b> Kabul inspired either Laila or Mariam, their voices, faces, and their incredible stories of survival were always with me, and a good part of my inspiration for this novel came from their collective spirit." ...|$|E
500|$|At age twenty, Del Rey {{signed a}} USD$10,000 {{recording}} contract {{and moved to}} a trailer park in New Jersey. The album that she recorded was later shelved, catalyzing her to pivot her focus. Instead, she began work in community service, and for the next five years, worked at homeless outreach, drug, and alcohol rehabilitation centers. She was quoted in an interview as saying, [...] "The only passionate people <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>in</b> New York, were social workers." [...] A few years later, Del Rey signed to 5 Point Records, an independent record label owned by David Kahne. With the label, she released the three-track EP, Kill Kill, in October 2008 and a full-length studio album Lana Del Ray in 2010. After hearing Del Rey's demo, Kahne contacted her; she obliged, knowing his reputation as a producer and his wish to produce music other than pop. Del Rey also explained why she then changed her stage name from Lizzy Grant to Lana Del Rey: [...] "I wanted a name I could shape the music towards. I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba – Lana Del Rey reminded us of the glamour of the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue".|$|E
500|$|In January 1954 Waugh sailed on the SS Staffordshire, {{bound for}} Ceylon. He hoped on the voyage {{to find the}} peace that would enable him to finish his stalled book. On board, his strange {{behaviour}} became an increasing concern to his fellow-passengers, and the letters which {{he wrote to his}} wife Laura from the ship alarmed her—Waugh appeared to be {{in the grip of a}} persecution mania in which he was beset by threatening, malevolent voices. He left the ship at Alexandria and flew on to Ceylon, but the voices continued to harass him. He wrote to Laura: [...] "Everything I say or think or read is read aloud by the group of psychologists whom <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>in</b> the ship... the artful creatures can communicate from many hundreds of miles away". Laura arranged for her friend Jack Donaldson to fly out with her to Colombo to bring Waugh home, but before they could do so Waugh returned to London of his own volition. There he was persuaded by his friend, the Jesuit priest Philip Caraman, to accept treatment from Eric Strauss, the head of psychiatry at St Bartholomew's Hospital. Strauss quickly diagnosed that Waugh's delusions arose from poisoning by his sleeping drugs, and substituted paraldehyde for chloral. The hallucinations disappeared immediately, and Waugh recovered his senses.|$|E
