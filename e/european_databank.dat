40|$|Production of {{wine vinegar}} by fermenting dried grapes and rehydrating with tap water {{is not allowed}} by European Regulations. In this study we proved {{experimentally}} that δ 18 O analysis of beverage water, officially used to detect the watering of wine and rehydration of concentrated fruit juice, can also be applied to vinegar to detect this kind of fraud. We considered fourteen production chains from wine to the corresponding raw vinegar and diluted vinegar (6 % of acidity), and the official <b>European</b> wine <b>databank</b> established according to EU Reg. 555 / 2008. δ 18 O limit values of − 2 ‰ and − 5 ‰ were defined for raw and diluted vinegars produced from fresh grapes. Values lower than these limits indicate a significant addition {{of water to a}} starting matrix with a sugar concentration much higher than fresh grapes. On this basis, more than 60 % of 92 suspicious wine vinegars imported to the Italian market were shown not to be authentic, but rather obtained by diluting a concentrated source such as dried grapes with water.

5000|$|Interior {{ministers of}} 11 current (6 {{of them that}} time still future) members of the European Union met for {{informal}} talks to discuss common security and immigration issues during which Austria submitted a six-point security plan. Austria Interior Ministry spokesman Rudolf Gollia said the talks would take place in Vienna between the five largest EU states—Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain—and the six-nation Salzburg Group, comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Austria itself.Austria's Interior Minister Ernst Strasser outlined six proposals to share information and coordinate measures taken to improve security in Europe, {{in the wake of}} the March 11 train bombings in Madrid in which killed 191 people.Strasser's six-point plan included access to a <b>European</b> finger-printing <b>databank,</b> exchanges of information about people seeking visas and about travellers, improved cooperation between Interpol and its European equivalent Europol, new biometric information in passports and standardised security at EU airports.After the Madrid attacks, Austria called for the establishment of a new intelligence service dubbed [...] "a European CIA", but ran into opposition from France and Germany.The ministers also discussed the status of refugees which had just been harmonised by the EU despite criticism from aid and rights organisations.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{and analyses}} {{a number of}} outstanding regulatory aspects in {{the completion of the}} European pharmaceutical single market. It discusses pricing and competition in pharmaceuticals {{in the aftermath of the}} 3 Frankfurt Roundtables and their results. It analyses the environment for generic competition in the European Union (EU) and the extent to which this environment needs to be amended in order for such competition to be promoted. It links the issues of parallel trade, standardisation, single trademark, the <b>European</b> <b>databank</b> and the definition of innovation with the current situation in the functioning of the single market, particularly the sovereignty of the member states in determining pricing and reimbursement levels. It argues that the above problems need to be tackled in conjunction with pricing and reimbursement. The paper further points at new developments, in particular biotechnology patenting and orphan drug regulation, where the EU has introduced or is about to introduce new legislation that has been needed for a long time and examines how this legislation can be beneficial. Finally, the paper analyses the implications for healthcare provision in the member states of 2 legal cases heard before the European Court of Justice in relation to the free movement of goods and healthcare provided across borders. The paper concludes that there is still a long list of regulatory aspects that remain unresolved despite the fact that significant progress has been made to date, and observes that economic analysis in pharmaceutical regulation is very much intertwined with political expediency. In addition, the definition of political expediency varies as one considers developments at the EU or national level, since it does not necessarily follow that individual actors coincide in opinion.

40|$|This {{exciting}} {{volume is}} required reading for every librarian {{who needs to}} understand the rapid changes in Western European information services resulting from the new European Community. As Western Europe moves toward a unified economic market, librarians must prepare for a corresponding unification of information services and databases. In the Spirit of 1992 provides vital information on the linkage of information services in the newly established European community. This important volume represents a commitment to increase access to an impressive <b>European</b> <b>databank</b> by an expanded global clientele. Through an elaboration of the information infrastructure supporting political, economic, social, and bibliographic interconnections among Western European nations, readers will gain a detailed understanding of this multifaceted landscape. In the Spirit of 1992 encourages the furthering of human and technological partnerships through enhanced information exchange {{to ensure that the}} world will enjoy better access to information for improved international decision making. Librarians will gain detailed understanding of contemporary developments in Western European librarianship from informative chapters on topics such as information policy and library status in the European Community, standardization and other cooperative strategies among libraries in Europe, bibliographic access in the United Kingdom, access to information stores in Nordic countries, access to selected European online databases, and implications of European libraries’cooperative developments for American libraries.

40|$|Insulin pump therapy, {{also known}} as {{continuous}} subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), is an important and evolving form of insulin delivery, which is mainly used for people with type 1 diabetes. However, even with modern insulin pumps, errors of insulin infusion can occur due to pump failure, insulin infusion set (IIS) blockage, infusion site problems, insulin stability issues, user error {{or a combination of}} these. Users are therefore exposed to significant and potentially fatal hazards: interruption of insulin infusion can result in hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis; conversely, delivery of excessive insulin can cause severe hypoglycaemia. Nevertheless, the available evidence on the safety and efficacy of CSII remains limited. The European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) have therefore joined forces to review the systems in place for evaluating the safety of pumps from a clinical perspective. We found that useful information held by the manufacturing companies is not currently shared in a sufficiently transparent manner. Public availability of adverse event (AE) reports on the US Food and Drug Administration’s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database is potentially a rich source of safety information but is insufficiently utilised due to the current configuration of the system; the comparable database in Europe (<b>European</b> <b>Databank</b> on Medical Devices, EUDAMED) is not publicly accessible. Many AEs appear to be attributable to human factors and/or user error, but the extent to which manufacturing companies are required by regulators to consider the interactions of users with the technical features of their products is limited. The clinical studies required by regulators prior to marketing are small and over-reliant on bench testing in relation to ‘predicate’ products. Once a pump is available on the market, insufficient data are made publicly available on its long-term use in a real-world setting; such data could provide vital information to help healthcare teams to educate and support users, and thereby prevent AEs. As well as requiring more from the manufacturing companies, we call for public funding of more research addressing clinically important questions in relation to pump therapy: both observational studies and clinical trials. At present there are significant differences in the regulatory systems between the USA and European Union at both pre- and post-marketing stages; improvements in the European system are more urgently required. This statement concludes with a series of recommended specific actions for ‘meknovigilance’ (i. e. a standardised safety approach to technology) which could be implemented to address the shortcomings we highlight...|$|E
