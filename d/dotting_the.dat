Approximately 27percent of the Science Reserve had been surveyed by 2000, identifying 76shrines, 4adze manufacturing workshops, 3other markers, 1positively identified burial site, and 4possible burial sites. By 2009, {{the total number of}} identified sites had risen to 223, and archaeological research on the volcano's upper flanks is ongoing. It has been suggested that the shrines, which are arranged around the volcano's summit along what may be an ancient snow line, are markers for the transition to the sacred part of Mauna Kea. Despite many references to burial around Mauna Kea in Hawaiian oral history, few sites have been confirmed. The lack of shrines or other artifacts on the many cinder cones <b>dotting</b> <b>the</b> volcano may be because they were reserved for burial.|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} small InP quantum dots in a GaInP matrix {{theoretically}} and experimentally. Using low-temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy {{in conjunction with}} six band k. p calculations, including direct and exchange interactions, we show that <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> size is a crucial parameter that determines whether <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> is neutral or charged with electrons in the nominally undoped n-type host material. For a small enough quantum <b>dot,</b> <b>the</b> conduction-band ground state is positioned above the Fermi level and <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> remains neutral. However, as soon as <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> is large enough for the conduction-band ground state to be located below the Fermi level <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> is charged. Furthermore, we show that, for neutral quantum <b>dots,</b> <b>the</b> position of the bi-exciton emission line {{with respect to the}} exciton emission line depends on the size of <b>the</b> quantum <b>dot</b> and that <b>the</b> bi-exciton emission can be {{on either side of the}} exciton emission: for <b>the</b> smallest <b>dots</b> <b>the</b> bi-exciton emission is always at higher energy than the exciton emission but for larger <b>dots</b> <b>the</b> ordering is the opposite with the exciton emission line on the high-energy side...|$|R
40|$|A double-quantum-dot {{coupled to}} {{electrodes}} with spin-dependent splitting of chemical potentials (spin bias) is investigated theoretically {{by means of}} the Green's functions formalism. By applying a large spin bias, the quantum spin in a quantum <b>dot</b> (<b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1) can be manipulated in a fully electrical manner. To noninvasively monitor the manipulation of the quantum spin in <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1, it is proposed that <b>the</b> second quantum <b>dot</b> (<b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 2) is weakly coupled to <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1. In <b>the</b> presence of the exchange interaction between <b>the</b> two <b>dots,</b> <b>the</b> polarized spin in <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1 behaves like an effective magnetic field and weakly polarizes the spin in <b>the</b> nearby quantum <b>dot</b> 2. By applying a very small spin bias to <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 2, <b>the</b> spin-dependent transport through <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 2 can be probed, allowing the spin polarization in <b>the</b> <b>dot</b> 1 to be identified nondestructively. These two steps form a complete scheme to manipulate a trapped spin while permitting this manipulation to be monitored in the double-dot system using pure electric approaches...|$|R

25|$|Temporal {{resolution}} of fMRI is limited by: (1) the feedback mechanism {{that raises the}} blood flow operating slowly; (2) having to wait till net magnetization recovers before sampling a slice again; and (3) having to acquire multiple slices to cover the whole brain or region of interest. Advanced techniques to improve temporal resolution address these issues. Using multiple coils speeds up acquisition time in exact proportion to the coils used. Another technique is to decide which parts of the signal matter less and drop those. This could be either those sections of the image that repeat often in a spatial map (that is small clusters <b>dotting</b> <b>the</b> image periodically) or those sections repeating infrequently (larger clusters). The first, a high-pass filter in k-space, has been proposed by Gary H. Glover and colleagues at Stanford.

25|$|The segment between Peterborough and Perth {{was built}} in the 1930s during the Great Depression, as a public works {{employment}} project. It was constructed parallel to a CP Rail corridor (now abandoned east of Peterborough) that {{was built in}} the 1880s, and used hand-power to dig and build the road whenever possible. From Peterborough to Norwood, the route travels in a straight line through the Peterborough Drumlin Field, connecting to the southern terminus of Highway28 and crossing the Indian River while otherwise passing through farmland. At Norwood the route suddenly begins to meander as it approaches the undulated Canadian Shield. The section east of Havelock to Perth, unlike the rest of the highway, travels through a relatively isolated area, with few services or residences along the route outside of the several towns that it connects. In contrast to the surroundings west of there, this section is located in dense forest with numerous lakes and muskeg <b>dotting</b> <b>the</b> landscape.

25|$|The Cedars was {{originally}} {{developed in the}} 1870s with moderately-priced homes, but by the late 19th century the neighborhood {{had become one of}} the premier destinations in Dallas, with stately Victorian homes belonging to wealthy businessmen, lawyers, and politicians <b>dotting</b> <b>the</b> streets. The Cedars was also the home of Dallas' Jewish community, and the neighborhood included the Shaareth Israel synagogue. (Stanley Marcus of Neiman Marcus fame was born in the Cedars.) By the early 20th century, however, light industry and growing population pressures had begun to take the bloom off the neighborhood's rose, and most of the city's wealthiest began to move further north to neighborhoods northeast of downtown. Even as industry, such as the Sears-Roebuck warehouse that now is home of the South Side on Lamarlofts, moved in, fine homes continued to be built, especially for well-to-do members of the Jewish community. But by the 1920s, the massive Victorians of the late 19th century were gone, the synagogue was demolished, and most people moved on. In the 1960s, virtually all of the remaining homes were destroyed by the city for highway projects. Today, only a scant handful of homes (perhaps as few as six) from the neighborhood's original residents survive, none in restored condition.|$|E
