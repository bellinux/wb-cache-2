40|$|<b>Grouper</b> (<b>Epinephelus</b> <b>spp.)</b> is a {{group of}} fish species with great {{economic}} importance in Asian countries. A novel hybrid grouper, generated by us and called the Hulong grouper (Hyb), has better growth performance than its parents, E. fuscoguttatus (Efu, ♀) and E. lanceolatus (Ela, ♂). We previously reported that the GH/IGF (growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor) system in the brain and liver contributed to the superior growth of the Hyb. In this study, using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), we analyzed RNA expression levels of comprehensive genes in the muscle of the hybrid and its parents. Our data showed that genes involved in glycolysis and calcium signaling in addition to troponins are up-regulated in the Hyb. The results suggested that the activity of the upstream GH/IGF system in the brain and liver, along with the up-regulated glycolytic genes as well as ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and troponins related to the calcium signaling pathway in muscle, led to enhanced growth in the hybrid grouper. Muscle contraction inducing growth could be the major contributor to the growth superiority in our novel hybrid grouper, which may be a common mechanism for hybrid superiority in fishes...|$|R

40|$|Asian {{countries}} contribute nearly 90 {{per cent}} to global production of culture fisheries. Diversification of species {{is not happening}} in fish culture {{because of the high}} value shrimp commands in the export market. Shrimp farming is on the increase in all the major shrimp-producing Asian countries. Higher the growth in shrimp production, higher is the instability in production due to production risks associated with ecosystem complexities and disease incidences. Most of the shrimp-producing countries have been moving towards specialization of shrimp production for export because of the high price that the shrimp asserts in the international market. A comparison between the Asian countries for the period 1976 - 2002 has revealed that Malaysia has maintained low growth and low instability and higher diversification, and Bangladesh and Vietnam have diversified in fish exports. In a country-level comparison, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines have shown moderate growth in production and export of shrimp. The instability associated with their shrimp production has also been moderate. Diversification in fish production as well as exports has been suggested for assured income to farmers and the country. It has been pointed that replacing, supplementing or rotating the shrimp farming with culture of other high-value fish species like Asian sea bass (Lates calcarifer), <b>grouper</b> (<b>Epinephelus</b> <b>spp),</b> mullets (Mugil spp) and milk fish (Chanos spp) culture may ease the risks in mono-cropping of shrimp.

To date, {{the roles of}} grouper genes, especially interferon related genes in virus infection remained largely unknown. Here, the ISG 15 homolog (EcISG 15) was cloned from grouper Epinephelus coioides and its immune response to Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) and grouper nervous necrosis virus (GNNV) was investigated. The full-length EcISG 15 cDNA was composed of 948 bp and encoded a polypeptide of 155 amino acids with 37 - 68 % identity with the known ISG 15 homologs from other fish species. Amino acid alignment analysis indicated that EcISG 15 contained two ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains and an Ub-conjugation domain (LRGG). Expressional analysis showed that EcISG 15 was dramatically induced by GNNV infection, poly I:C or poly dA-dT treatment, but no obvious changes were observed during SGIV infection. Immunofluorescence assay showed that EcISG 15 localized mainly in the cytoplasm of grouper cells in response to poly I:C stimulation or GNNV infection, but not in mock or SGIV infected cells. Western blot analysis indicated that the ISGylation was absent in SGIV-infected cells, but significantly enhanced in GNNV-infected or poly I:C transfected cells, suggesting that EcISG 15 might play different roles in SGIV and GNNV infection. Furthermore, overexpression of EcISG 15 in vitro inhibited the transcription of GNNV genes significantly. Taken together, {{the results indicated that}} fish ISG 15 might exert important roles against RNA virus infection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Grouper</b> (<b>Epinephelus</b> <b>spp)</b> is an {{economically}} important fish species worldwide. However, viral pathogens such as nervous necrosis virus (NNV) have been causing severe infections in the fish, resulting in great {{loss in the}} grouper aquaculture industry. Yet, {{the understanding of the}} molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of NNV is still inadequate, mainly due to insufficient genomic information of the host. Results De novo assembly of grouper transcriptome in the grouper kidney (GK) cells was conducted by using short read sequencing technology of Solexa/Illumina. A sum of 66, 582 unigenes with mean length of 603 bp were obtained, and were annotated according to Gene Ontology (GO) and Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG). In addition, the tag-based digital gene expression (DGE) system was used to investigate the gene expression and pathways associated with NNV infection in GK cells. The analysis revealed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response was prominently affected in NNV-infected GK cells. A further analysis revealed an interaction between the NNV capsid protein and the ER chaperone immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein (BiP). Furthermore, exogenous expression of NNV capsid protein was able to induce XBP- 1 mRNA splicing in vivo, suggesting a role of the capsid protein in the NNV-induced ER stress. Conclusions Our data presents valuable genetic information for <b>Epinephelus</b> <b>spp.,</b> which will benefit future study in this non-model but economically important species. The DGE profile of ER stress response in NNV-infected cells provides information of many important components associated with the protein processing in ER.

40|$|Fish {{production}} from freshwater cages and pens, and marine cages and pens constitute 19 % {{of the total}} foodfish produced from aquaculture in the Philippines. In 1998, {{production from}} freshwater cages and pens contributed about P 2. 5 billion or about 10 % of the total revenues from aquaculture. Freshwater cage and pen culture is practiced {{in most of the}} major lakes and reservoirs in the country. The most important species cultured in freshwater cages are tilapia and bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis) while milkfish (Chanos chanos) is farmed in freshwater pens at Laguna de Bay. Small water impoundments intended for the irrigation of upland farms are also being used to culture tilapia and other freshwater fish in cages. The unregulated expansion of cages and pens, use of high stocking densities, and excessive feeding has resulted in the deterioration of the water quality in many areas. This has prompted the more informed local government authorities to adopt measures limiting further expansion of cage and pen culture activities beyond the carrying capacity of freshwater bodies to prevent periodic occurrences of mass fish kills. While cage mariculture of groupers has been practiced in the Philippines since the 1980 s, {{it was only in the}} early 1990 s that much of the growth and expansion of the industry occurred with the popularization of milkfish mariculture. In the last five years, no less than 1, 000 cages with an aggregate capacity in excess of 10, 000 metric tons a year have been invested in milkfish sea farming. The species now acounts for about 90 % of the production from marine cages. In recent years, a drop in milkfish prices has motivated the industry to focus its attention on other fishes, primarily <b>grouper</b> (<b>Epinephelus</b> <b>spp.),</b> snapper (Lutjanus spp.), sea bass (Lates calcarifer) and siganid (Siganus spp.). Currently, imported species such as red tilapia, yellow-wax pompano (Trachinotus blochii) and red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) are also being tested by the private sector.
