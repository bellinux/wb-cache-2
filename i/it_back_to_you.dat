2500|$|Sometime in {{the early}} 1900s McCreight {{received}} a scrawled hand written letter in pencil reading: ”Please send me three hundred dollars. [...] I am in jail. [...] I will send <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> when I get out of jail.” [...] The letter was signed Felix Flying Hawk. [...] There was no date, heading or return address. [...] However, the postmark showed Chadron, Nebraska, a few {{miles south of the}} Dakota line just off the Indian reservation. McCreight knew Chief Flying Hawk, but did not know that he had any relatives, much less a son. McCreight tells the story: ...|$|E
2500|$|Days {{before the}} decree {{absolute}} of divorce, letters patent were issued with general rules to regulate royal titles after divorce. Diana lost the style Her Royal Highness {{because she was}} no longer married to the Prince of Wales and instead was styled Diana, Princess of Wales. The Queen reportedly wanted to let Diana continue to use the style after her divorce, but Charles had insisted on removing it. As the mother of the prince expected to one day ascend to the throne, she was accorded the same precedence she enjoyed during her marriage. Prince William was reported to have reassured his mother: [...] "Don't worry, Mummy, I will give <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> one day when I am King." [...] Almost a year before, according to Tina Brown, the Duke of Edinburgh had warned the Princess of Wales: [...] "If you don't behave, my girl, we'll take your title away." [...] She is said to have replied: [...] "My title is a lot older than yours, Philip." [...] Diana and her mother quarrelled in May 1997 after she told Hello! magazine that Diana was happy to lose her title of Her Royal Highness following her controversial divorce from Prince Charles. They were reportedly not on speaking terms with each other by the time of Diana's death.|$|E
60|$|BARBARA. I nearly got it, Bill. But we've sold <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> for ten {{thousand}} pounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Carefully. I hesitated {{over that}} story, Shack, really I did. It {{had some good}} points. I was writing <b>you</b> a letter <b>to</b> send with it when <b>it</b> goes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I regret--" ...|$|R
60|$|THE LADY. Then {{you think}} they are there still! But if the German War Office gets the list--and she will copy it before she gives <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Blueloo, <b>you</b> may depend on it--all is lost.|$|R
60|$|ANOTHER YOUTH. No: {{the other}} arm: youre putting <b>it</b> on <b>back</b> <b>to</b> front. <b>You</b> are a silly little beast.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{stop the}} {{slaughter}} of the innocents," [...] answered Dick. [...] "He'll give <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> later. But don't try to carry it again," [...] went on Dick in a low voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are other}} hawks and luck returns," [...] I replied, bowing. [...] "Perhaps this trinket will bring <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> my lady," [...] {{and taking the}} snake-surrounded ruby heart, I proffered it to her with another bow.|$|E
60|$|Dear, I {{had just}} folded up your parcel for Miss Alexander {{that my brother}} George should take it to-morrow. It has been my first {{opportunity}} for England--at least, for London. But now I will carry <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you....</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were very}} wise," [...] he said. [...] "My brother and Lady Ashleigh have {{recovered}} from the shock of poor Lena's death in a marvellous manner, I believe, but {{the sight of the}} girl might have brought <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> them. <b>You</b> have left her with friends, I hope, Mr. Quest?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Further, repaying {{double the}} initial amount of a loan, after a fixed time, was common {{commercial}} {{practice of the}} period: a common Assyrian loan of 1900 BCE consisted of loaning 2 minas of gold, getting back 4 in five years, and an Egyptian proverb of the time was [...] "If wealth is placed where it bears interest, <b>it</b> comes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> redoubled." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll take <b>it</b> right <b>back</b> <b>to</b> where <b>you</b> found it," [...] added Sam. [...] "And {{be careful}} that you don't break it worse than it is, or you'll foot the bill." ...|$|R
6000|$|MAGGIE. Because I thought I might {{perhaps have}} the courage and the womanliness to give <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> [JOHN has a brief dream.] Will you never hold it up against me {{in the future that}} I couldn't do that? ...|$|E
6000|$|Brooke {{looked down}} on her gravely, and shook his head. [...] "I am not fit to wear it, and yet I dare not give <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> stained as it is," [...] he said. [...] "What am I to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No use of {{creating}} a disturbance so soon," [...] said Jack. [...] "We'd only get into hot water, and maybe Colonel Colby would become so disgusted he would send us right home. If Martell took that suitcase, he won't dare to keep it, for that would be stealing. More than likely he'll sneak <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> by to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I, too, {{was fond}} of dancing; but, as you say, it has gone away. <b>It</b> will come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> in half-a-dozen years, perhaps. It can never come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me. Things do come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> men.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The first warning {{addressed}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{yesterday was}} a friendly one. Profit by <b>it.</b> Go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Lenox. <b>You</b> are only exposing yourself to danger {{and the person}} <b>you</b> seek <b>to</b> discomfort. Wait there, and some one shall come <b>to</b> <b>you</b> shortly who will explain what has happened, and the necessity for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I {{could prove}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> very easily, {{but it would}} take an hour or more, so it shall be for another time. This scarab is a poor thing, give <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me and <b>you</b> shall have a better. Or would you choose this signet? As I am no longer Prince of Egypt it is useless to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought so," [...] she said, gravely {{examining}} it, [...] "but I kin mend it {{as good as}} new. I reckon {{you allow}} I can't sew," [...] she continued, [...] "but I do heaps of mendin', as the digger squaw and Chinamen we have here do only the coarser work. I'll send <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and meanwhiles you keep mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As for that," [...] quoth Hereward (who had remounted {{his horse}} from {{prudential}} motives, and set him athwart the gateway, {{so that there}} was no chance of the doors being slammed behind him), [...] "if either of you will lend me sixteen pence, I will pay <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and St. Peter before I die, with interest enough to satisfy any Jew, on the word of a gentleman and an earl's son." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{little book}} is charmingly written, and it {{interested}} me. But it flies {{too high for}} me. Its concretest things are filmy abstractions to me, and when I lay my grip {{on one of them}} and open my hand, I feel as embarrassed as I use to feel when I thought I had caught a fly. I'm going to try to mail <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> to-day--I mean I am going to charge my memory. Charging my memory is one of my chief industries....|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps you didn't quite {{hear all}} that, Midgetina. You led me on. You force {{things out of}} me till I am sick. But some day, when you are as desperate as I have been, <b>it</b> will come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Then you'll {{know what it is}} to be human. But there can't be any {{misunderstanding}} left now, can there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “The {{pleasure}} of working,” said his father, “is not {{the fun of}} doing amusing things, but the satisfaction and solid happiness of being faithful in duty, and accomplishing some useful purpose. For example, if I were to lose my pocket-book on the road, and should tell <b>you</b> <b>to</b> walk <b>back</b> a mile, and look carefully all the way until you found it, {{and if you did}} it faithfully and carefully, you would find a kind of satisfaction in doing it; and when you found the pocket-book, and brought <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me, <b>you</b> would enjoy a high degree of happiness. Should not you?” ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{presently}} she {{was calm}} again and she said: [...] "What I've been telling you, {{you can understand}} little o' the now, but some of <b>it</b> will come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> when you're a grown man, and if you're magerful and have some lassie in your grip, maybe for {{the memory of her}} that bore you, you'll let the poor thing awa'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Goodwife," [...] said he, [...] "I am Hugh Morrison from Glenae, come of the Manly Morrisons of auld lang syne, {{that never}} took short weapon against {{a man in}} their lives. And neither needed they. They had their broadswords, and I have this bit supple"--showing a {{formidable}} cudgel; [...] "for dirking ower the board, I leave that to John Highlandman.--Ye needna snort, none of you Highlanders, and you in especial, Robin. I'll keep the bit knife, if you are feared for the auld spaewife's tale, and give <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> whenever you want it." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{is another}} thing I have learnt. Never lend a pencil to a woman {{if you ever want}} to see it again. She has three answers to your request for its return. The first, that she gave <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and that you put it in your pocket, and that it's there now, and that if it isn't it ought to be. The second, that you never lent it to her. The third, that she wishes people would not lend her pencils and then clamour for them back, just when she has {{something}} else far more important to think about.|$|E
6000|$|Imprimis--it {{was clear}} as the day that this swinish {{multitude}} {{were not to be}} driven by force. They were to be humoured, borne with very patiently: a courteous though sedate manner impressed them; a very rare flash of raillery did good. Severe or continuous mental application they could not, or would not, bear: heavy demand on the memory, the reason, the attention, they rejected point-blank. Where an English girl of not more than average capacity and docility would quietly take a theme and bind herself to the task of comprehension and mastery, a Labassecourienne would laugh in your face, and throw <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> with the phrase,--"Dieu, que c'est difficile! Je n'en veux pas. Cela m'ennuie trop." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God {{planted the}} seeds of all these trees," [...] {{continued}} Hetty, after a moment's pause, [...] "and <b>you</b> see <b>to</b> what a height and shade they have grown! So {{it is with the}} Bible. You may read a verse this year, and forget it, and <b>it</b> will come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> a year hence, when <b>you</b> least expect <b>to</b> remember it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Twasn't me, Flip," [...] {{said the}} old man, deprecatingly, but glaring at the {{astonished}} Postmaster. [...] "Twasn't my doin'. I allus said if you cast your bread on the waters <b>it</b> would come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> by return mail. The fact is, the Gov'ment is gettin' too high-handed! Some o' these bloated officials had better climb down before next leckshen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Four {{thousand}} dollars' weight if a penny!" [...] said Stacy, {{in short}} staccato sentences. [...] "In a pocket! Brought {{it out the}} second stroke of the pick! We'd been awfully blue after you left. Awfully blue, too, when that bill of sale came, for we thought you'd been wasting your money on US. Reckoned we oughtn't to take it, but send <b>it</b> straight <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Messenger gone! Then Demorest reckoned as it was done it couldn't be undone, {{and we ought to}} make just one 'prospect' on the claim, and strike a single stroke for you. And there it is. And there's more on the hillside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You obeyed my wishes, but {{you were}} not kind. You gave me my tea, Eustace, {{as if you were}} giving a drink to your dog. And then you {{wondered}} in a languid way (thinking, I suppose, of Mrs. Beauly all the time), at my dropping the cup in handing <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I really could not help it; my hand would tremble. In my place, your hand might have trembled too--with the arsenic under the bedclothes. You politely hoped, before you went away? that the tea would do me good--and, oh God, you could not even look at me when you said that! You looked at the broken bits of the tea-cup.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to do four things, Uncle Eugene," [...] she said, as calmly as if she were making the most natural and {{ordinary}} request in the world. [...] "I {{want you to}} lend us the money to send Leicester to Blue Hill Academy; he will pay <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> when he gets through college. I want you to lend Jean the money for music lessons; she will pay you back when she gets far enough along to give lessons herself. And I want you to lend me the money to shingle our house and get Mother a new dress and fur coat for the winter. I'll pay you back sometime for that, because I am going to set up as a dressmaker pretty soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|Day {{after day}} the booth {{was so full}} it was hardly {{possible}} to enter it, and what the neighbour foretold had come to pass, and Jimmu was a rich man. Yet {{he did not feel}} happy. He was an honest man, and he thought that he owed some of his wealth to the man from whom he had bought the kettle. So, one morning, he put a hundred gold pieces into it, and hanging the kettle once more on his arm, he returned to the seller of it. 'I have no right to keep it any longer,' he added when he had ended his tale, 'so I have brought <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and inside you will find a hundred gold pieces as the price of its hire.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You will yet be grateful, I think!' he {{answered}} gravely. 'When <b>it</b> comes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in loneliness and solitude you will, I believe, think it worth being grateful for. I don't {{mean that you}} will be grateful to me, but for the thing itself. I speak out of the wisdom of many years. At your time of life the knowledge cannot come from observation. It may my poor boy, come through pain; and if what I think is correct you will even in due time be grateful to the pain which left such golden residuum.' He paused, and Harold grew interested. There was something in the old man's manner which presaged a truth; he, at least, believed it. So the young man listened at first with his ears; and as the other spoke, his heart listened too: ...|$|R
6000|$|Rosalie {{smiled and}} kissed her again. [...] "Be brave, my dear," [...] she said, [...] "and I am sure {{you will be able}} to find Cap'n Bill without getting in danger yourself. But be careful not to let any Blueskin touch you, for while you are in contact with any person you will become visible. Keep out of their way, and you will be {{perfectly}} safe. Don't lose the ring, for <b>you</b> must give <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me when <b>you</b> return. It is one of my witchcraft treasures, and I need it in my business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I'll have <b>to</b> tell <b>you.</b> <b>It</b> goes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> India--what <b>you</b> {{might call}} a 'debt of honor.' I {{borrowed}} the money in London to square it; and thought when I came to Canada I'd be too far away for the London fellow to put undue pressure on me. Oh, I meant to pay sometime, when I was ready; but the fellow transferred the debt to a man at Winnipeg, who has sent me a curt demand with an extortionate bill of expenses. Now I have to pay." ...|$|R
