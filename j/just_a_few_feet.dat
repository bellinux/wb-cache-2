25|$|The GAO {{report also}} {{identified}} major security risks to FBI {{personnel in the}} D.C. metropolitan area because of the Hoover building's limitations. The Hoover building is surrounded on all sides by busy city streets which are <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> from the structure. Additionally, because the Hoover Building {{is too small to}} accommodate the FBI's post-9/11 activities, the agency has leased space in 21 locations throughout the metro area, nine of which are in multi-tenant buildings. The FBI admitted its internal security forces are not stationed at these leased spaces, but merely patrol them periodically.|$|E
25|$|On July 14, 2017, {{a statue}} of Clarence Darrow was {{unveiled}} in Dayton, Tennessee on the Rhea County Courthouse lawn, funded by a $150,000 donation from the FFRF. The courthouse {{was the site of}} the historic 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial wherein Darrow unsuccessfully defended a teacher, John T. Scopes, who was found guilty of teaching evolution in a public school in violation of what was then a Tennessee state law. The statue was placed <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> away from {{a statue of}} William Jennings Bryan, Darrow's creationist opponent in the trial, which had been erected in 2005 by nearby Bryan College.|$|E
25|$|Upon examination, the {{military}} surgeons determined that no one's neck {{had been broken}} by the fall. The manacles and cloth bindings were removed but not the white execution masks, and the bodies were placed into the pine coffins. The name of each person was written {{on a piece of}} paper by acting Assistant Adjutant R. A. Watts, and inserted in a glass vial, which was placed into the coffin. The coffins were buried against the prison wall in shallow graves, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> from the gallows. A white picket fence marked the burial site.

25|$|Several days later, on 14 July, 45â€‘year-old Natalia Mamarchuk {{was riding}} her scooter {{in the nearby}} village of Diyovka. As she was passing through a wooded area, two men {{approached}} her and knocked her down. They then bludgeoned her {{to death with a}} hammer or pipe and drove off on her scooter. Local witnesses gave chase but lost sight of the attackers. Two local children also witnessed the attack from nearby, hidden in a tent <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> away. They provided a detailed description matching the one given by Lyakhov. A task force was quickly set up from Kiev, headed by lead criminal investigator Vasily Paskalov. The manhunt soon grew to encompass most local law enforcement. Reportedly over 2,000 investigators worked on the case.|$|E
25|$|This {{left the}} team {{in a state of}} disarray with the {{consensus}} view that the team should be disbanded. At that point, Radbourn offered to start every game {{for the rest of the}} season (having pitched in 76 of 98 games the season before) in exchange for a small raise and exemption from the reserve clause for the next season. From that point, July 23 to September 24 when the pennant was clinched, Providence played 43 games and Radbourn started 40 of them and won 36. Soon, pitching every other day as he was, his arm became so sore he couldn't raise it to comb his hair. On game day he was at the ballpark hours before the start, getting warmed up. He began his warm up by throwing <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet,</b> increasing the distance gradually until he was pitching from second base and finally from short centerfield.|$|E
500|$|The {{accident}} occurred {{south of}} Valemount, [...] east {{of a small}} station named Canoe River, [...] westbound from Cedarside. The crash {{took place on the}} only stretch (18-mile (29km) long) of CNR mainline in the mountains not protected by automatic block signals. The leading cars of each train were derailed, while those which {{had been part of the}} troop train were demolished. According to testimony at the inquiry, most of the deaths were caused by steam from the troop train's ruptured boiler penetrating the damaged cars. At the moment of the crash, two soldiers, Gunners William Barton and Roger Bowe, both of Newfoundland, were buying cigarettes at the newsstand aboard the train. The structure of the newsstand shielded them in the crash, and they survived. Their fellow Newfoundlanders, Gunners Joseph Thistle and James A. White, standing <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> away, were not shielded by the newsstand and perished.|$|E

50|$|Before 1923, {{the site}} where the Cenotaph now stands was {{occupied}} by an ornate drinking fountain which was erected in 1867 to mark the completion of the Water Works in 1866.

500|$|In {{addition}} to being a primary factor {{in the development of the}} largest valleys, the dike complex plays another important role that of creating and maintaining the water table. Hawaiian lava is extremely permeable and porous. Rainwater easily seeps into the lava, creating a large lens of fresh water below the island surface. In most places, the top of the water table is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> from sea level, as the fresh water lens is floating on salt water. Unlike porous lava flows, however, dikes cool underground into dense rock with few cracks and vesicles. The dikes act as impermeable vertical walls through which groundwater cannot flow. Deep layers of ash compact into impermeable layers between lava flows, preventing percolation of the rainwater. Rainwater that would ordinarily seep right through the ground gets trapped in the dike [...] "reservoirs," [...] located well above sea level. The groundwater is confined to a flow along the dike until it finds a means to escape.|$|E
500|$|To {{the right}} of Queen Charlotte, HMS Brunswick had {{initially}} struggled to join the action. Labouring behind the flagship, her captain John Harvey received a rebuke from Howe for the delay. Spurred by this signal, Harvey pushed his ship forward and almost outstripped Queen Charlotte, blocking her view of {{the eastern half of}} the French fleet for a time and taking severe damage from French fire as she did so. Harvey hoped to run aboard Jacobin and support his admiral directly, but was not fast enough to reach her and so attempted to cut between Achille and Vengeur du Peuple. This manoeuvre failed when Brunswick's anchors became entangled in Vengeur's rigging. Harvey's master asked if Vengeur should be cut loose, to which Harvey replied [...] "No; we have got her and we will keep her". The two ships swung so close to each other that Brunswick's crew could not open their gunports and had to fire through the closed lids, the ships battering each other from a distance of <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
500|$|Both Anupama Chopra of NDTV and Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff.com gave Enthiran {{a rating}} of {{three and a half}} out of five stars. Chopra criticised the film's {{portions}} in the second half, describing them as [...] "needlessly stretched and cacophonous", but concluded her review by saying, [...] "Robot rides on Rajinikanth's shoulders and he never stoops under the burden. Aided by snazzy clothes, make-up and special effects, he makes Chitti endearing." [...] Srinivasan, however, said that Shankar [...] "strikes the balance between science fiction and masala quotient." [...] She concluded that, [...] "Whichever way you look at it, [...] is one of those rare films that give you just enough material to pull you in, and enjoy yourself." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 gave {{a rating of}} three out of five stars and said, [...] "In the end, it's the fantastic special effects and an inspired performance from [...] that keeps the film fresh."

2500|$|Based on the {{compromise}} {{set forth by}} the Israeli High Court of Justice in 2003, alternative prayer groups function at the Robinson's Arch section.

WoW has rejected the solution." [...] Women Of the Wall (WoW) spokeswomen have stated that they wish to relocate from the Robinson's Arch section to the traditional women's section in order to influence traditional women to join the WoW group, demand changes from their rabbis, remove the mechitza (separation between women and men) {{for most of the}} day, transfer authority over religious sites from the Rabbinate to secular courts, and make changes in Israeli society concerning marriage, divorce, conversion and burial.|$|E
