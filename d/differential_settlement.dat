A sand beach was constructed to protect the face of the embankment from the tailings solution, but it was not properly maintained. Prior to the collapse, the level of the tailings solution in the holding pond had risen two feet higher than the dam's designed limit, and the sand beach no longer provided the dam protection. The United States Army Corps of Engineers concluded in its report to Governor Bruce King of New Mexico that the principal cause of failure was <b>differential</b> <b>settlement</b> of the foundation beneath the dam wall, and the report commissioned by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission corroborated this conclusion. Critical variations in tailings pond operation practice from approved procedures contributed further to the dam failure. United Nuclear's Chief Operating Officer, J.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Lining systems {{render a}} {{significant}} role in ensuring that waste materials are safely separated from the environment. Despite the advent of modern lining systems, compacted clay barriers or liners are {{regarded as one of the}} very significant components of lining system and are being used as a waste containment system in landfills which require insignificant infiltration. Compacted clay barriers made-up of soil minerals of low permeability characteristics are generally prone to damage: (i) for not meeting the required material characteristics, (ii) due to continuous <b>differential</b> <b>settlements</b> attributed to heterogeneous composition of municipal solid waste and sub-soil and (iii) low overburden in the case of top capping system. <b>Differential</b> <b>settlements</b> lead to bending and are critical for the behaviour of clay liners. As a result, the clay barrier could loose its integrity and sealing efficiency. The present study addresses the potential of biaxial geogrid layer as an alternative solution for restraining cracking of clay barrier at the onset of <b>differential</b> <b>settlements.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUsually, the {{vulnerability}} of structures is treated considering only one single hazard, for example either seismic hazard or ground instability. However, historical monuments, cultural heritage structures or old masonry structures can be affected, over the past centuries of existence, by a succession of different hazards. The objective {{of this paper was}} to quantify the changes in the seismic vulnerability of a given structure previously damaged by quasi-static <b>differential</b> <b>settlements.</b> In view of this, a soil-structure model of the masonry building is constructed using TREMURI software by putting springs {{at the base of the}} building to account for the soil behaviour. Classical empirical relationships are used for setting the mechanical properties of these foundation springs. The chosen equations are valid for both static and dynamic situations. The soil-structure model is first submitted to <b>differential</b> <b>settlements</b> with maximum magnitudes ranging from 5 to 25 cm.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article.

The model tunnel employed consists of an interior brass cylinder surrounded by water inside a sealed flexible latex lining. Prior to extracting water to simulate tunnelling volume loss, soil displacements obtained during centrifuge acceleration indicate that this flexible tunnel can lead to <b>differential</b> <b>settlements</b> during spin-up. These ground movements are triggered by a change of the tunnel shape due to a stress imbalance between the tunnel and the surrounding soil. Additionally, it was found that surface structures interact with the model tunnel during the spin-up, and thus can change the amount of <b>differential</b> surface <b>settlements,</b> depending on the structure location. As a consequence, some <b>differential</b> <b>settlements</b> may be imposed on the structures as the g-level increases.

This article deals with the factor of heat sourced from a structure (brick kiln) as a restrictive factor in foundation engineering in clay soils and introduces a documentation of soil deformation observations as an impact of the heat transmission into the geological environment. It was carried out in Southern Moravia in the Czech Republic, where the dominant foundation soils are Neogeneous clays where <b>differential</b> <b>settlements</b> of a tunnel kiln structure occurred as a result of ignoring the boundary conditions of temperature changes in the soil environment. The brick kilns caused heterogeneous spatial changes in the subsoil temperatures. This consequently resulted in <b>differential</b> <b>settlements</b> due to temperature changes originating from the kilns. The <b>differential</b> <b>settlements</b> reached as much as 150 mm. The major objective of the article is to highlight the importance of the heat transmission from buildings into the geological environment as a factor which should be considered in engineering geology and its application in planning. A new procedure for reducing or elimination of ground movements sourced from underlying clayey soils depending on the heat changes was also suggested in this context. Web of Science 7282955294...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{problems}} of major concern in designing large oil storage tanks is the interaction with the foundation soil, particularly in terms of <b>differential</b> <b>settlements.</b> Ultimate or serviceability limit states can be reached due to non-allowable local displacements along the tank perimeter.

The analyses address the influence of local soil yielding on excess pore pressure response {{as well as on the}} trend of lateral displacements and perimeter <b>differential</b> <b>settlements.</b> As soon as soil reaches a yielding condition, significant changes occur in terms of the overall soil-structure interaction phenomena, with consequences mainly in the displacement patterns and rates.

40|$|AbstractThe common {{challenges}} for constructing embankments on soft clay include low bearing capacity, large total and <b>differential</b> <b>settlements,</b> and slope instability. Different techniques {{have been adopted}} to improve soft clay, {{such as the use}} of foundation columns including stone columns, deep mixed columns, and vibro-concrete columns, etc. Due to increased traffic volume, column-supported embankments may be widened to accommodate the traffic capacity need. Adding a new embankment to an existing embankment generates additional stresses and deformations under not only the widened portion but also the existing embankment. <b>Differential</b> <b>settlements</b> between and within the existing embankment and the widened portion may cause pavement distresses. Limited research has been conducted so far to investigate widening of column-supported embankments. In this study, a two-dimensional finite difference numerical method was adopted. This numerical method was first verified against field data and then used for the analysis of widened column-supported embankments over soft clay. The modified Cam-Clay model was used to model the soil under the existing embankment and the widened portion. Mechanically and hydraulically coupled numerical models were created to consider the consolidation of the foundation soil under the existing embankment and the widened portion. Different layouts of foundation columns under the existing embankment and the widened portion were investigated. The numerical results presented in this paper include the vertical and horizontal displacements, the maximum settlements, the transverse gradient changes, and the stress concentration ratios, which depended on column spacing. The columns installed under the connection side slope were most effective in reducing the total and <b>differential</b> <b>settlements,</b> horizontal displacement, and transverse gradient change of the widened embankment...|$|R

A detailed analysis of the inhomogeneities of the facade, historic documentation, and recent restoration interventions carried out in an adjacent building, suggest that the Palace underwent various modiﬁcations both on the structural conﬁguration and on the borne loads. Such modiﬁca tions might be the main cause of some <b>differential</b> <b>settlements</b> and of the consequent signiﬁcant crack pattern on the load-bearing walls.
