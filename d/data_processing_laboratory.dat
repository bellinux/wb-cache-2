40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to analyze the 1973 and 1975 {{vocational}} business and office education graduates trained in the intensive office laboratory, the <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>laboratory,</b> and the cooperative office education programs in Region VI of the State of Indiana. Tables were constructed to display aggregate and detailed data pertaining to: 1. employment status of graduates 2. reasons for graduate unemployment 3. length of time graduates have beenemployed 4. satisfaction of the graduates withcurrent employment 5. perception of the graduates of thehigh school vocational programs 6. number of graduates continuing posthigh school training 7. type of institutions serving thegraduates post high school trainingneeds 8. occupational classification of the employed vocational business and office education graduates 9. graduate participation in the Office Education Association. So that the {{purpose of the}} study could be met, all 577 vocational business and office education graduates were surveyed. The data was based on a return of 365 questionnaires or a 68. 9 per cent return. A questionnaire was developed and field tested. After the graduates returned the questionnaire, questionnaires were mailed to the employers of the graduates employed in an office occupation to determine the validity of the data collected. Some of the findings are: 1. Sixty-nine per cent of the graduates were employed, twenty per cent were not seeking employment, and eleven per cent were seeking employment. 2. Over seventy-six per cent of the employed graduates were employed in office occupations and fifty-three per cent were still employed in the first employment position. 3. Fifty-four per cent of the employed graduates were employed within the same geographic area where the vocational training was provided and forty-six per cent had been employed longer than thirteen months. 4. Seventy-one per cent of the unemployed graduates had been employed since graduation. 5. Twenty per cent of the employed cooperative office education graduates and twenty per cent of the intensive office education graduates were employed as secretaries. 6. Twelve per cent of the data processing graduates were employed as computer operators and twelve per cent as key punch operators. 7. Fifteen per cent of the employed graduates and forty-three per cent of the unemployed graduates were enrolled in post high school training. Based on the data, some of the conclusions are: 1. The vocational programs currently underway must be meeting the needs of the graduates since more than ninety per cent of all vocational business and office education graduates within Region VI have been employed. 2. Vocational programs are training students for employment positions which meet the desires of graduates since more than seventy-five per cent of the respondents working in office occupations were satisfied with the current employment position. 3. The vocational programs must be providing the necessary training within the current vocational business and office education programs since more than ninety per cent of the graduates working in office positions indicated that they were adequately prepared for the position. Following are some of the recommendations of the study: 1. A comprehensive longitudinal follow-up study should be conducted on the vocational graduates that follows the progression of the graduatesin and out of the labor market and post-secondary education institutions. 2. Follow-up studies should be conducted every one and three years and a standard questionnaire should be adopted by the Indiana State Department of Public Instruction. 3. A follow-up study should be conducted with the employers of the vocational graduates to ascertain the extent of employer satisfaction with the job competence and performance of the graduates.

40|$|Four {{methods for}} {{analyzing}} azimuthal anisotropy from dipole logging data are described and attempted in this paper. These techniques {{are based on}} the phenomena of flexural wave splitting in anisotropic materials and are analogous to the techniques used for vertical seismic profiling (VSP) <b>data</b> <b>processing.</b> The <b>laboratory</b> measured dipole data obtained with a scaled tool and a scaled borehole drilled in an anisotropic material (phenolite) are employed to simulate the flexural modes propagating in transversely isotropic (TI) formation with symmetry axis perpendicular to the borehole, and to examine and compare these methods. Amplitude and particle motion analyses of the laboratory data demonstrate that, under the conditions of our laboratory measurements and numerical simulation, only the polarization direction of the fast flexural mode is consistent in accordance with the fast principal direction of the anisotropic material. The slower mode, which is much easier to excite and is of much larger amplitude than the fast mode, turns out to be subject to interferences and is complicated; it has not been well-understood. The particle motion of this guided mode is highly elliptical, and its polarization direction always changes irregularly with the source orientations. The first three methods used in VSP data processing-the linear-transform technique, the technique of rotating the data matrix in the time domain, and the technique of rotating the propagator matrix in the frequency domain-do not work well for the case of flexural modes. The fourth method-determining the eigen-direction of a TI material by identifying the the polarization with polar energy spectrum-works best for the data used in this study.

Furthermore, the sensor fusion algorithm, often a Kalman filter, should be modified in order to handle the delay. This paper examines different possibilities for handling delays and applies a new technique to a sensor fusion system for estimating the location of an Autonomous Guided Vehicle. The system fuses encoder and vision measurements in an extended Kalman filter. Results from experiments in a real environment are reported. 1 Introduction In a complex control system more than one sensor is often needed to generate and maintain a reliable state estimate. Furthermore, the complexity of the computations in sensors will often introduce significant time delays from the acquisition to the availability of a measurement.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present novel {{automated}} field spectroradiometers for collecting unattended, continuous and long-term measurements of plant canopies and, more in general, of Earth’s ecosystems. These systems simultaneously collect high and ultra-high resolution spectra in the visible to near-infrared (VNIR) domain employing two spectrometers: i) the first covers the spectral range 400 - 1000 nm with a 1. 0 nm spectral resolution; ii) the second provides a sub-nanometer spectral resolution within the 700 - 800 nm spectral range. The {{data collected by}} the first spectrometer allow retrieval of VNIR reflectance, while the higher spectral resolution data from the second device permit estimation of vegetation Sun-Induced Fluorescence (SIF) in the O 2 -A band. The instruments are constructed by assembling commercial and on-the-shelf optical optoelectronic devices to facilitate reproduction of the instrument for promoting measurements over different ecosystems. The instrument’s optical design, <b>data</b> collection and <b>processing,</b> <b>laboratory</b> and field calibration methods are reported and discussed. The high spectral resolution and the rigorous calibration methods enable accurate estimation of SIF in physical units by exploiting almost the same retrieval concept {{as that of the}} European Space Agency FLuorescence EXplorer mission. Reliability of the radiance, reflectance and fluorescence measurements collected by the Multiplexer Radiometer Irradiometer (MRI) and its compacted version (SFLUOR box) are tested in several field campaigns to: i) collect continuous measurements during the vegetation growing season; ii) calibrate/validate the novel airborne HyPlant imager.
