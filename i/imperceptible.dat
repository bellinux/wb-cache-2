5|$|Lemurs are unusual {{since they}} have great {{variability}} in their social structure, yet generally lack sexual dimorphism in size and canine tooth morphology. However, some species tend towards having larger females, and two species of true lemur (genus Eulemur), the gray-headed lemur (E. albocollaris) and the red lemur (E. rufus), exhibit size differences in canine teeth. True lemurs show sexual dichromatism (sexual differences in fur coloration), but {{the difference between the}} genders varies from strikingly obvious, as in the blue-eyed black lemur (E. macaco), to nearly <b>imperceptible</b> {{in the case of the}} common brown lemur (E. fulvus).|$|E
5|$|The Sautrāntika school held {{a form of}} phenomenalism {{that saw}} the world as <b>imperceptible.</b> It held that {{external}} objects exist only as a support for cognition, which can only apprehend mental representations. This influenced the later Yogacara school of Mahayana Buddhism. The Yogācāra school is often called the mind-only school because of its internalist stance that consciousness is the ultimate existing reality. The works of Vasubandhu have often been interpreted as arguing for some form of Idealism. Vasubandhu uses the dream argument and a mereological refutation of atomism to attack the reality of external objects {{as anything other than}} mental entities. Scholarly interpretations of Vasubandhu's philosophy vary widely, and include phenomenalism, neutral monism and realist phenomenology.|$|E
5|$|For {{landings}} and take-offs, wire flying riggings were devised and used. On location, {{these were}} suspended from tower cranes, {{whereas in the}} studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings. Some of the wire-flying work was quite audacious considering computer-controlled rigs were not then available—the penultimate shot where Superman flies out of the prison yard for example. Although stuntmen were used, Reeve did {{much of the work}} himself, and was suspended as high as 50feet in the air. Counterweights and pulleys were typically used to achieve flying movement, rather than electronic or motorized devices. The thin wires used to suspend Reeve were typically removed from the film in post-production using rotoscope techniques, although this wasn't necessary in all shots (in certain lighting conditions or when Superman is very distant in the frame, the wires were more or less <b>imperceptible).</b>|$|E
5|$|Sasuke is the remarkable, sole {{survivor}} of the once powerful Uchiha clan of Konoha. At age seven, he survived the massacre of his entire clan {{at the hands of}} his brother, Itachi Uchiha, who spared his life only because he deemed Sasuke unworthy to kill. When first assigned to Team 7, Sasuke is antisocial, superior and unwilling to cooperate with his team members, Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, but he eventually concedes that they are useful. Sasuke awakens his Sharingan, the inherited ability of the Uchiha clan to see through illusions (genjutsu), which allows him to see and learn <b>imperceptible</b> movements at a super-human rate. As time passes, Sasuke seeks out very strong opponents in order to convince himself that he is growing physically.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} the Aristarchus plateau has been the site of many {{reported}} transient lunar phenomena, {{with a total of}} 122 such reports by 2007; the highest recorded for any lunar feature. Such events include temporary obscurations and colorations of the surface, and catalogues of these show that {{more than one-third of the}} most reliable spottings come from this locale. In 1971 when Apollo 15 passed 110 kilometers above the Aristarchus plateau, a significant rise in alpha particles was detected. These particles are believed to be caused by the decay of radon-222, a radioactive gas with a half-life of only 3.8 days. The Lunar Prospector mission later confirmed radon-222 emissions from this crater. These observations could be explained by either the slow and visually <b>imperceptible</b> diffusion of gas to the surface, or by discrete explosive events.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost <b>imperceptible</b> to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E

25|$|A digital {{watermark}} is called <b>imperceptible</b> if the original cover signal and the marked signal are perceptually indistinguishable.|$|E
25|$|This {{should not}} be {{confused}} with perceptual, that is, watermarking which uses the limitations of human perception to be <b>imperceptible.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{transition}} from Hindu god-king to Mahayana bodhisattva-king was probably gradual and <b>imperceptible.</b> The prevailing Vaishnavite and Shaivite faith traditions {{gave way to}} the worship of the Gautama Buddha and the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara.|$|E
25|$|Birds {{can also}} detect slow moving objects. The {{movement}} {{of the sun and}} the constellations across the sky is <b>imperceptible</b> to humans, but detected by birds. The ability to detect these movements allows migrating birds to properly orient themselves.|$|E
25|$|A digital {{watermark}} is called robust {{with respect to}} transformations if the embedded information may be detected reliably from the marked signal, even if degraded by any number of transformations. Typical image degradations are JPEG compression, rotation, cropping, additive noise, and quantization. For video content, temporal modifications and MPEG compression often are added to this list. A {{digital watermark}} is called <b>imperceptible</b> if the watermarked content is perceptually equivalent to the original, unwatermarked content. In general, {{it is easy to}} create either robust watermarks—or—imperceptible watermarks, but the creation of both robust—and—imperceptible watermarks has proven to be quite challenging. Robust <b>imperceptible</b> watermarks have been proposed as a tool for the protection of digital content, for example as an embedded no-copy-allowed flag in professional video content.|$|E
25|$|His Cello Concerto, {{dedicated}} to Siegfried Palm (1966) contains two movements. The first movement {{begins with an}} almost <b>imperceptible</b> cello which slowly shifts into static tone clusters with the orchestra before reaching a crescendo and slowly decaying. The second movement is a virtuoso piece of dynamic atonal melody {{on the part of}} the cello.|$|E
25|$|Mungrisdale Common lies {{north of}} Blencathra {{of which it}} is an outlier. Gently graded grassy slopes fall from Atkinson Pike, Blencathra's {{northern}} summit. Upon meeting the head of Blackhazel Beck, the shoulder divides in two, the northeastern arm connecting to Bannerdale Crags and the north western branch continuing to descend to Mungrisdale Common. Beyond an almost <b>imperceptible</b> depression the reascent is only 6ft.|$|E
25|$|North eastward from Lord's Seat, {{branching}} {{off from the}} ridge connection to Barf, is a long and sometimes <b>imperceptible</b> watershed which runs up the shore of Bassenthwaite. This divides the catchments of Wythop Beck (flowing north west) and Beck Wythop, a short stream running directly east into the lake. Some way to the north, this line of higher ground ends at Sale Fell.|$|E
25|$|They lay it {{down as a}} principle, {{that the}} {{immediate}} cause of the smallpox exists in the mortal part of every human and animal form; that the mediate (or second) acting cause, which stirs up the first, and throws it {{into a state of}} fermentation, is multitudes of <b>imperceptible</b> animalculae floating in the atmosphere; that these are the cause of all epidemical diseases, but more particularly of the small pox.|$|E
25|$|If {{the camera}} {{position}} and image framing (i.e., angle of view) have been chosen, {{the only means}} of controlling DOF is the lens aperture. Most DOF formulas imply that any arbitrary DOF can be achieved by using a sufficiently large f-number. Because of diffraction, however, this isn't really true. Once a lens is stopped down to where most aberrations are well corrected, stopping down further will decrease sharpness in the plane of focus. At the DOF limits, however, further stopping down decreases the size of the defocus blur spot, and the overall sharpness may still increase. Eventually, the defocus blur spot becomes negligibly small, and further stopping down serves only to decrease sharpness even at DOF limits (Gibson 1975, 64). There is thus a tradeoff between sharpness in the POF and sharpness at the DOF limits. But the sharpness in the POF is always greater than that at the DOF limits; if the blur at the DOF limits is <b>imperceptible,</b> the blur in the POF is <b>imperceptible</b> as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the written word has {{recently}} evolved to include an informal, colloquial written style, in which an everyday conversation can occur through writing rather than speaking. Written communication can also be delivered with minimal time delay (e-mail, SMS), and in some cases, with an <b>imperceptible</b> time delay (instant messaging). Writing is a preservable means of communication. Some people regard the growth of multimedia literacy {{as the first step}} towards a postliterate society.|$|E
25|$|When tuning {{instruments}} {{that can produce}} sustained tones, beats can be readily recognized. Tuning two tones to a unison will present a peculiar effect: when the two tones are close in pitch but not identical, the difference in frequency generates the beating. The volume varies like in a tremolo as the sounds alternately interfere constructively and destructively. As the two tones gradually approach unison, the beating slows down and may become so slow as to be <b>imperceptible.</b>|$|E
25|$|In optics, {{particularly}} {{as it relates}} to film and photography, depth of field (DOF), also called focus range or effective focus range, is the distance between the nearest and farthest objects in a scene that appear acceptably sharp in an image. Although a lens can precisely focus at only one distance at a time, the decrease in sharpness is gradual {{on each side of the}} focused distance, so that within the DOF, the unsharpness is <b>imperceptible</b> under normal viewing conditions.|$|E
25|$|An {{addition}} to the school, also designed by Kahn, was constructed in 1924, and houses an auditorium and additional classroom space. The addition so closely follows {{the style of the}} original building that the difference is nearly <b>imperceptible.</b> After the original Liggett campus on Cass closed, the Liggett School occupied the building until 1964, when the school moved to Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan. In 1969, The Liggett School merged with Grosse Pointe University School to form what is now University Liggett School.|$|E
25|$|From {{the latter}} 2000s to the present, Arroyo Seco {{and the rest}} of the Sierra Gorda in Querétaro have been {{experiencing}} numerous small earthquakes, with most registering from 2.5 to 3.5 on the Richter scale, generally <b>imperceptible</b> to humans. Seismologists say that while the number has been unusual, such activity is not and is due to the settling of the sedimentary rock which is below most of the Sierra Gorda region. However, Arroyo Seco and other municipalities have seismographs installed to monitor the situation.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, Belgium annexed the Congo as {{a colony}} and proclaimed a general sea-change in {{administrative}} policy. Actual change, however, was nearly <b>imperceptible.</b> The era of World War I shifted attention from atrocities in Africa to European trench warfare. In the post-war era, the global demand for reform was largely forgotten. However, commercial rubber tree farming had become firmly established and {{the collection of}} wild rubber became commercially insignificant, just as ivory supplies had been exhausted years earlier. Because of this, the slave labor industries of the Congo diminished in importance and atrocities became far less frequent. Finally, in 1960, the Congo gained independence.|$|E
25|$|Although mining had {{provided}} foreign exchange, {{the vast majority}} of Hondurans gained their livelihoods from agriculture, usually on a subsistence level. Periodic efforts were made to develop agricultural exports, but they met with little success. Some tobacco, cattle, and hides were exported, mostly to neighboring countries. The recurring civil conflicts and the resultant confiscation of stock by various military commanders, however, put a damper on efforts to develop the cattle industry and contributed to its rather backward status. Some bananas and other fruits were exported from the Islas de la Bahía, much of this trade going to New Orleans, but the volume was small and the benefit {{for the rest of the}} nation almost <b>imperceptible.</b>|$|E
25|$|Windows Media Audio (WMA) is {{the most}} common codec of the four WMA codecs. Colloquial usage of the term WMA, {{especially}} in marketing materials and device specifications, usually refers to this codec only. The first version of the codec released in 1999 is regarded as WMA 1. In the same year, the bit stream syntax, or compression algorithm, was altered in minor ways and became WMA 2. Since then, newer versions of the codec have been released, but the decoding process remained the same, ensuring compatibility between codec versions. WMA is a lossy audio codec based on the study of psychoacoustics. Audio signals that are deemed to be <b>imperceptible</b> to the human ear are encoded with reduced resolution during the compression process.|$|E
25|$|As {{a pitcher}} in baseball's amateur era, Creighton changed the sport with his {{pitching}} style, from {{a game that}} showcased fielding into a confrontation between the pitcher and batter. During his era, a pitcher was required to deliver the ball in an underhand motion with a stiff arm/stiff wrist movement. The speed with which Creighton was able to pitch the ball had previously been thought of as impossible without movement of his elbow or wrist. If there were any movements in his elbow or wrist, they were <b>imperceptible,</b> but he was accused by some opponents and spectators of using an illegal delivery. However, the competitive advantage of this delivery, and his success as a pitcher, eventually led others to emulate his technique.|$|E
25|$|The bite is {{immediately}} followed by local pain of a burning character; the limb soon swells and becomes discoloured, and within {{one to three}} hours great prostration, accompanied by vomiting, and often diarrhoea, sets in. Cold, clammy perspiration is usual. The pulse becomes extremely feeble, and slight dyspnoea and restlessness may be seen. In severe cases, which occur mostly in children, the pulse may become <b>imperceptible</b> and the extremities cold; the patient may pass into coma. In from twelve to twenty-four hours these severe constitutional symptoms usually pass off; {{but in the meantime}} the swelling and discoloration have spread enormously. The limb becomes phlegmonous, and occasionally suppurates. Within a few days recovery usually occurs somewhat suddenly, but death may result from the severe depression or from the secondary effects of suppuration. That cases of death, in adults as well as in children, are not infrequent {{in some parts of the}} Continent is mentioned in the last chapter of this Introduction.|$|E
25|$|The forest wildcat's fur {{is fairly}} uniform in length {{throughout}} the body. The {{hair on the}} tail is very long and dense, thus making it look furry and thick. In winter, the guard hairs measure 7cm, the tip hairs 5.5–6cm, and the underfur 4.5–5.5cm. Corresponding measurements in the summer are 5–6.7cm, 4.5–6cm, and 5.3cm. In winter, the forest wildcat's main coat colour is fairly light gray, becoming richer along the back, and fading onto the flanks. A slight ochreous shade is visible on the undersides of the flanks. A black and narrow dorsal band starts on the shoulders, and runs along the back, usually terminating {{at the base of}} the tail. Indistinct black smudges are present around the dorsal band, which may form a transverse striping pattern on rare occasions. The undersurface of the body is very light gray, with a light ochreous tinge. One or more white spots may occur on rare occasions on the throat, between the forelegs, or in the inguinal region. The tail is the same colour as the back, with the addition of a pure black tip. 2–3 black, transverse rings occur above the tail tip. The dorsal surface of the neck and head are the same colour as that of the trunk, but is lighter gray around the eyes, lips, cheeks, and chin. The top of the head and the forehead bear four well-developed dark bands. These bands sometimes split into small spots which extend to the neck. Two short and narrow stripes are usually present in the shoulder region, in front of the dorsal band. A dark and narrow stripe is present on the outer corner of the eye, under the ear. This stripe may extend into the neck. Another such stripe occurs under the eye, which also extends into the neck. The wildcat's summer coat has a fairly light, pure background colour, with an admixture of ochre or brown. In some animals, the summer coat is ashen coloured. The patterns on the head and neck are as well-developed as those on the tail, though the patterns on the flanks are almost <b>imperceptible.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Everglades are {{a complex}} system of interdependent ecosystems. Marjory Stoneman Douglas {{described}} {{the area as}} a [...] "River of Grass" [...] in 1947, though that metaphor represents {{only a portion of}} the system. The area recognized as the Everglades, prior to drainage, was a web of marshes and prairies [...] in size. Borders between ecosystems are subtle or <b>imperceptible.</b> These systems shift, grow and shrink, die, or reappear within years or decades. Geologic factors, climate, and the frequency of fire help to create, maintain, or replace the ecosystems in the Everglades.|$|E
500|$|The sawgrass {{grows in}} prairies or strands, in between {{channels}} {{of water in}} a shallow river [...] long and [...] wide flowing from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay. Some authors refer to the sawgrass and water combination as the [...] "true Everglades" [...] or just [...] "the Glades". Prior to the first drainage attempts in 1905, the sheetflow, or the wide shallow river starting in Lake Okeechobee, occupied {{nearly a third of}} the lower Florida peninsula. Though sawgrass remains the main feature of the Everglades, other ecosystems are scattered among the marshes and prairies, and their borders are sometimes <b>imperceptible.</b>|$|E
