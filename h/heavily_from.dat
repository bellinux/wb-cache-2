5|$|Horton {{appeared}} {{again in}} Horton Hears a Who, published in 1954. The {{plot of the}} 2000 Broadway musical Seussical, a retelling {{of a number of}} Dr. Seuss books, borrows <b>heavily</b> <b>from</b> both Horton books.|$|E

5|$|The West also {{suffered}} more <b>heavily</b> <b>from</b> {{the instability of}} the 3rd century AD. This distinction between the established Hellenised East and the younger Latinised West persisted and became increasingly important in later centuries, leading to a gradual estrangement of the two worlds.|$|E
5|$|The later {{accounts}} of Prester John borrowed <b>heavily</b> <b>from</b> literary texts concerning the East, including the great body of ancient and medieval geographical and travel literature. Details were often lifted from literary and pseudohistorical accounts, {{such as the}} tale of Sinbad the Sailor. The Alexander romance, a fabulous account of Alexander the Great's conquests, was especially influential in this regard.|$|E
5|$|According to Burton Fisher, Puccini and Forzano {{borrowed}} <b>heavily</b> <b>from</b> the commedia dell'arte {{tradition in}} Gianni Schicchi. Schicchi himself recalls the roguish Harlequin, while his daughter Lauretta, whose romance is nearly foiled by Buoso's relatives, resembles Columbina. Simone {{is drawn from}} Pantaloon, while the poverty-stricken Betto recalls the buffoonish valet Zany. Doctor Spinelloccio recalls the classic doctor from the commedia dell'arte, Balanzone even to his Bolognese origin. The Moor whose death momentarily scares the relatives, and his captain, are stock characters from commedia dell'arte.|$|E

5|$|After the Camp returned, Smith drew <b>heavily</b> <b>from</b> its {{participants}} to establish five governing {{bodies in the}} church, all originally of equal authority to check one another. Among these five groups was a quorum of twelve apostles. Smith gave a revelation saying that to redeem Zion, his followers would have to receive an endowment in the Kirtland Temple, and in March 1836, at the temple's dedication, many participants in the promised endowment saw visions of angels, spoke in tongues, and prophesied.|$|E
5|$|As English courts do {{not form}} part of Singapore's {{hierarchy}} of courts, decisions of such courts are not binding on Singapore courts. However, {{as a result of}} Singapore's colonial heritage, English judicial precedents continue to exercise a strong influence on the legal system and are regarded as highly persuasive, particularly as regards the development of the common law, and the interpretation of English statutes applicable in Singapore and Singapore statutes modelled on English enactments. Judicial precedents from other jurisdictions may also be persuasive in specific areas of Singapore law. For instance, Indian decisions are persuasive in the areas of criminal law and procedure because Singapore borrowed <b>heavily</b> <b>from</b> India in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Besides these distributions, {{there are}} some {{independent}} operating systems based on FreeBSD. DragonFly BSD is a fork from FreeBSD 4.8 aiming for a different multiprocessor synchronization strategy than the one chosen for FreeBSD 5 and development of some microkernel features. It does not aim to stay compatible with FreeBSD and has huge differences in the kernel and basic userland. MidnightBSD is a fork of FreeBSD 6.1 borrowing <b>heavily</b> <b>from</b> NeXTSTEP, particularly in the user interface department.|$|E

5|$|Coleman has {{speculated that}} modern-day {{prosperity}} theology borrows <b>heavily</b> <b>from</b> the New Thought movement, though {{he admits that}} the connection is sometimes unclear. Jenkins notes that critics draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the cargo cult phenomenon. While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities, he argues that it can also bear similarities to traditional African religious rituals. J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University compares the movement to Black theology owing to its focus on uplifting oppressed groups, though he notes that it differs in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change.|$|E
5|$|Following the armistice, the Australian Mounted Division {{went into}} camp at Tripoli while the Anzac Mounted Division, having borne {{the brunt of}} the entire campaign, {{suffered}} <b>heavily</b> <b>from</b> malaria and influenza in the Jordan Valley. Australia's role in the Sinai and Palestine campaign was later acknowledged by Field Marshal Edmund Allenby, who had been commander-in-chief of the Allied forces in the Middle East, as having been considerable. Total Australian battle casualties in the campaign were 4,851, including 1,374 dead.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny began {{drafting}} {{a new constitution}} for Côte d'Ivoire after the country's independence from France on 7 August 1960. It drew <b>heavily</b> <b>from</b> the United States Constitution in establishing a powerful executive branch, and from the Constitution of France, which limited the capacities of the legislature. He transformed the National Assembly into a mere recording house for bills and budget proposals. On 27 November 1960, Houphouët-Boigny was elected unopposed to the Presidency of the Republic, while a single list of PDCI candidates {{was elected to the}} National Assembly.|$|E

5|$|Saria {{conceived}} Loev script {{while he}} was working on another project, and drew <b>heavily</b> <b>from</b> his personal experiences. It was eventually picked up for production despite Saria's own doubts on its viability. Principal photography took place at Mahabaleshwar, the UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Western Ghats in peninsular India, and Mumbai, in the summer of 2014. The film was shot within sixteen days by the cinematographer Sherri Kauk in 2K resolution. Made on a shoestring budget, the film relied on crowdfunding and costcutting measures to meet its production costs.|$|E
5|$|Takechi's Daydream {{had been}} {{considered}} a national embarrassment by the Japanese government because of its highly publicized release while the world {{was focused on the}} country for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Takechi's third film had suffered <b>heavily</b> <b>from</b> the governmental censorship, yet no legal action had been taken. Takechi's fourth film, the Nikkatsu-produced Black Snow (1965), was even more controversial than his previous work. David Desser credits Black Snow with bringing a political theme to the pink film. Politics would be featured in many later films in the pink genre, most notably those of Kōji Wakamatsu.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{were also}} in need of rest and were {{suffering}} <b>heavily</b> <b>from</b> tropical diseases, which had inflicted more casualties than Japanese actions in {{this phase of the}} campaign. Nevertheless, after the fall of Wareo, fighting in the area continued. In order to enable the two main Japanese infantry regiments to make a clean break, the 2nd Battalion, 238th Infantry Regiment, carried out rearguard operations in the Wareo area until 15 December. On 8 December, shortly after the capture of Kwatingkoo, a company from the 2/24th Infantry Battalion was ambushed while moving towards Bazuluo; eight Australians were killed and another four wounded.|$|E

5|$|The episode borrows <b>heavily</b> <b>from</b> the 1985 comedy film Clue, the 1976 comedy film Murder by Death, and {{is largely}} {{based upon the}} 1939 Agatha Christie novel And Then There Were None. The opening scene of the episode {{is similar to that}} of Stanley Kubrik's The Shining. Once the Griffin family arrives at the mansion, Lois remarks on the estate's beauty, {{wondering}} if television host Jeff Probst has a similar home. As they walk into the mansion, Sir John Everett Millais's Ophelia is seen. As dinner commences, Carl begins conversing with Tom Tucker, and discusses the plot of the 1986 fantasy film Labyrinth, directed by Jim Henson.|$|E
5|$|The film drew <b>heavily</b> <b>from</b> the {{conventions}} of Westerns, and is a defining example of the masala film, which mixes several genres in one work. Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as glorification of violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, homosocial bonding, and the film's role as a national allegory. The combined sales of the original soundtrack, scored by R. D. Burman, and the dialogues (released separately), set new sales records. The film's dialogues and certain characters became extremely popular, contributing to numerous cultural memes and becoming part of India's daily vernacular. In January 2014, Sholay was re-released to theatres in the 3D format.|$|E
5|$|The game draws <b>heavily</b> <b>from</b> {{both the}} plot and {{aesthetic}} elements of film noir—stylistic films made {{popular in the}} 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity—along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes for its in-game cases, based upon what was reported by the Los Angeles media in 1947. The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option {{to play the game}} in black and white. Various plot elements refer to the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as The Naked City, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.|$|E
