500|$|Hartley {{is quick}} to point out that before [...] "Justice", the series did not focus on [...] "the costumes and the capes, the flying and the superhero stuff", because they have their [...] "no flights, no tights" [...] rule in effect. That changed with [...] "Justice", and Hartley {{suggested}} that the actors really had to commit themselves to their roles while wearing the costumes, [...] "otherwise you look like a standup comedian who doesn't like his jokes very much". Young stated that he was one of the luckiest out of the group, because he only had to wear a silver vest and regular pants, unlike Ritchson, who had to put on a [...] "onesie Speedo". Ritchson felt you could <b>get</b> <b>distracted</b> by what you were wearing, but it was best to try to take your mind off of the subject. Hartley, Ritchson, and Young stated that they felt sorry for Gallner for having to wear a costume that they believed [...] "sucked".

500|$|The episode makes several {{references}} to pop culture referencing films, music and media. When Roger {{takes on a}} persona to help Steve lose his virginity Steve exclaims his excitement to finally being able to use his dance moves. Afterwards the scene cuts to Toshi, Berry, Steve, Snot and Roger taking turns [...] humping an ottoman in a nod to a video, that went viral in 2006, in which five teenagers danced similarly. [...] The song [...] "Pony" [...] by Ginuwine plays during this sequence. Steve and Roger <b>get</b> <b>distracted</b> from the problem with Stan with watching Airplane! after they quote the classic [...] "Don't call me Shirley" [...] scene. They even watch , which Steve says {{is better than the}} first film, but actual reception was generally negative. The title of the episode is a reference to The Beatles' song of the same name. The sequence where Steve picks up a line of comic books and repeatedly says [...] "Ooh!", is a call back to the Family Guy episodes [...] "Peter's Got Woods" [...] and [...] "Back to the Woods", in which James Woods eats a trail of candy and says [...] "Ooh, a piece of candy!" [...] repeatedly.|$|E
500|$|Both {{teams had}} injury {{concerns}} {{ahead of the}} final. Liverpool {{were expected to be}} without midfielders Charlie Adam and Lucas Leiva, who were both out with knee injuries, while Chelsea were missing defenders David Luiz and Gary Cahill to hamstring injuries. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was determined to claim a domestic double with victory in the final: [...] "The FA Cup is special, but we got a taste of success from winning the Carling Cup. That will help the younger players in the squad. Winning breeds confidence and you want more." [...] Gerrard believed success in the final would compensate for a poor season in the Premier League: [...] "We are all aware we have underachieved in the league and the squad of players is certainly better than where we are. We will assess the season and if we win two trophies I think it would alleviate the pressure slightly." [...] Chelsea captain John Terry was hopeful Chelsea would win the final, to help caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo's hopes of getting the job full-time: [...] "To win it [...] will put himself in a very good position. He's not thinking of that at the moment, he's not letting the players <b>get</b> <b>distracted</b> by anything. He's very passionate, he's Chelsea through and through, and that's certainly rubbed off on the players. So, if we can do it with the added bonus that Robbie can get the job at the end, that'd be great." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{a special}} session at the XX International AIDS Conference, 2014, Geldof {{referred}} to sex workers as [...] "hookers", {{for which he was}} subsequently criticised. Christian Vega, a sex workers' rights activist and a member of Victoria's peer-only Victorian Sex Industry Network (VIXEN), blamed speakers including Geldof for their use of pejorative language, which perpetuated the very stigmas that are among the key barriers to HIV prevention. Geldof responded to the criticism during the closing session of the conference: [...] "I read today in the paper that my talk yesterday was littered with profanities – fuck them." [...] In Geldof's view, rights-based language hampered HIV prevention, and he defended using terms such as [...] "hookers" [...] and [...] "": [...] "Let’s not <b>get</b> <b>distracted</b> by diversionary language. Let’s call it as it is." [...] In a radio show after the conference on Joy 94.9, Vega dismissed Geldof’s view that rights-based language {{was a waste of time}} as “ridiculous”, as it served as an important tool to challenge stigma and discrimination, particularly within an HIV context.|$|E
2500|$|Suicide Season {{was written}} {{recorded}} in Arboga, an isolated Swedish village with producer Fredrik Nordström. Lead vocalist Oliver Sykes described Arboga as [...] "Nowheresville". Sykes considered the isolation Arboga provided as ideal {{in comparison to}} the constant activity in Birmingham, the recording location of their first album: [...] "We recorded Count Your Blessings in the middle of Birmingham and it was very easy to <b>get</b> <b>distracted.</b> Arboga is a village with nothing in it apart from a tiny shop and that was it". In during the initial recording of the album Nordström initially was absent from working with the band, in Sykes perspective he drew his own conclusion based on Count Your Blessings. However he turned up midway through their recording process and was shocked by the music they had written, and from that point became more involved in the recording process. Nordström also taught the band some basic levels of recording and production so they could work through the night. By the end of the album he said it was [...] "one of the best CDs he's done in years".|$|E
