40|$|The present work {{studied the}} {{productivity}} of plant and ratoon cane in soils with different physical, chemical and mineralogical particulars submitted to phosphate fertilization. Randomized block field experi- ments were located at Japungu Distillery (Paraíba State), at Sugar Cane Experimental Station of Carpina (Pernambuco State) and at Bom Jesus Sugar Cane plant (Pernambuco State), from where Argisoils of sandy, mid and clayey textures were selected respectively. The doses of 0, 40, 80, 120, 160 and 200 kg ha - 1 P 2 O 5 were applied {{at the bottom of}} the <b>furrow</b> (<b>fertilization</b> foundation). In the subsequent ratoon cane were applied 0 and 40 kg ha - 1 P 2 O 5 (topdressing) for each of the doses applied at the planting. It was concluded in this study that {{the productivity of}} sugarcane plant was positively influenced by phosphorus fertilization planting. The ratoon cane only responded nicely to phosphorus coverage in the less weathered medium texture Argisoils; Phospho- rus fertilization of ratoon sugarcane coverage in clay and weathered Argissolos did not promote increased productivity, restricting its recommendation in Argissolos with these characteristics...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} rate and method of urea {{application}} on the yield of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L., cv. IPA- 1) was evaluated on a Red-Yellow Latosol (Psamentic Haplortox) of Arapiraca {{and on a}} Solodic Planosol (Ustalf) of Igaci, both sandy-clay-loams located in the State of Alagoas, Brazil. Rates of 30, 60 and 90 kg N/ha were applied placing the urea totally in the furrow at planting time; totally sidedressed twenty days after planting, mixed or not with the soil; or 1 / 3 of the amount in the furrow at planting plus 2 / 3 sidedressed twenty days after planting, mixed or not with the soil. Bean yield responses to nitrogen foUowed quadratic equations. In the Red-Yellow Latosol response to nitrogen occurred up to the rate of 66 kg N/ha, while in the Solodic Planosol the yield increased up to the highest applied rate of 90 kg N/ha. The relative yield increase for each site was 22 % and 16 %, respectively. Sidedressed application of {{the total amount of}} urea resulted in the lowest yields, whereas split application and <b>furrow</b> <b>fertilization</b> were the best and equally effective methods. No significant yield increase was observed by mixing the urea with the soil. Key Words: bean, urea, nitrogen, method of application...|$|E

40|$|The study {{evaluated}} potato tuber {{yield and}} quality, using cultivar Atlantic, {{as a function}} of organomineral fertilizer doses applied in the planting furrow. The experiments were done in Cristalina, Goiás, in winter and summer cultive. The experimental design was randomized blocks, with six doses in the winter experiment and seven doses in the summer one, both with four replications. The doses were fixed according to the recommendation for mineral fertilizer. The doses evaluated were 2800 kg ha - 1 of formulation 3 - 32 - 6, 1629. 10, 2443. 60, 4072. 70 and 4887. 30 kg ha - 1 of organomineral fertilizer, corresponding to 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 % of the mineral fertilizer dose. A treatment with no fertilizer (control) was included in the summer experiment. Fertilizers were applied in the planting <b>furrow.</b> Side dressing <b>fertilization</b> was done 30 DAP, in winter crop, with 300 kg ha - 1 of formulation 20 - 00 - 20. Tubers were harvested, classified, weighed and yield (kg ha - 1) was determined {{at the end of the}} experiment. Results of winter crop were greater than those of sum- mer, for yield and tuber classification. Organomineral fertilizer, in the dose 4072. 70 kg ha - 1, representing 100 % of the mineral one, increased the yield of tubers Class Special. Winter crop presented good results for soluble solids contents...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Oocyte {{cortical}} granules {{are important}} in the fertilization of numerous species including mammals. Relatively {{little is known about}} the composition, migration, and pre-fertilization release of mammalian oocyte cortical granules. Results Results obtained with confocal scanning laser microscopy indicated that mouse oocytes have at least two populations of cortical granules, one that bound both the lectin LCA and the antibody ABL 2 and one that bound only LCA. Both types of granules were synthesized at the same time during oocyte maturation suggesting that the ABL 2 antigen is targeted to specific granules by a sorting sequence. The distribution of both populations of cortical granules was then studied during the germinal vesicle to metaphase II transition. As the oocytes entered metaphase I, the first cortical granule free domain, which was devoid of both populations of cortical granules, formed over the spindle. During first polar body extrusion, a subpopulation of LCA-binding granules became concentrated in the cleavage furrow and underwent exocytosis prior to fertilization. Granules that bound ABL 2 were not exocytosed at this time. Much of the LCA-binding exudate from the release at the cleavage furrow was retained in the perivitelline space near the region of exocytosis and was deduced to contain at least three polypeptides with approximate molecular weights of 90, 62, and 56 kDa. A second cortical granule free domain developed following pre-fertilization exocytosis and subsequently continued to increase in area as both, LCA and LCA/ ABL 2 -binding granules near the spindle became redistributed toward the equator of the oocyte. The pre-fertilization release of cortical granules did not affect binding of sperm to the overlying zona pellucida. Conclusions Our data show that mouse oocytes contain at least two populations of cortical granules and that a subset of LCA-binding cortical granules is released at a specific time (during extrusion of the first polar body) and place (around the cleavage <b>furrow)</b> prior to <b>fertilization.</b> The observations indicate that the functions of the cortical granules are more complex than previously realized and include events occurring prior to gamete membrane fusion. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} {{assessment of}} the potential of different management practices for mitigating specific components of the total GHG budget (N 2 O and CH 4 emissions and C sequestration) of Mediterranean agrosystems was performed in this study. Their suitability regarding both yield and environmental (e. g. nitrate leaching and ammonia volatilization) sustainability, and regional barriers and opportunities for their implementation were also considered. Based on its results best strategies to abate GHG emissions in Mediterranean agro-systems were proposed. Adjusting N fertilization to crop needs in both irrigated and rain-fed systems could reduce N 2 O emissions up to 50 % compared with a non-adjusted practice. Substitution of N synthetic fertilizers by solid manure can be also implemented in those systems, and may abate N 2 O emissions by about 20 % under Mediterranean conditions, with additional indirect benefits associated to energy savings and positive effects in crop yields. The use of urease and nitrification inhibitors enhances N use efficiency of the cropping systems and may mitigate N 2 O emissions up to 80 % and 50 %, respectively. The type of irrigation may also have a great mitigation potential in the Mediterranean region. Drip-irrigated systems have on average 80 % lower N 2 O emissions than sprinkler systems and drip-irrigation combined with optimized fertilization showed a reduction in direct N 2 O emissions up to 50 %. Methane fluxes have a relatively small contribution to the total GHG budget of Mediterranean crops, which can mostly be controlled by careful management of the water table and organic inputs in paddies. Reduced soil tillage, improved management of crop residues and agro-industry by-products, and cover cropping in orchards, are the most suitable interventions to enhance organic C stocks in Mediterranean agricultural soils. The adoption of the proposed agricultural practices will require farmers training. The global analysis of life cycle emissions associated to irrigation type (drip, sprinkle and <b>furrow)</b> and N <b>fertilization</b> rate (100 and 300 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1) revealed that these factors may outweigh the reduction in GHG emissions beyond the plot scale. The analysis {{of the impact of}} some structural changes on top-down mitigation of GHG emissions revealed that 3 – 15 % of N 2 O emissions could be suppressed by avoiding food waste at the end-consumer level. A 40 % reduction in meat and dairy consumption could reduce GHG emissions by 20 – 30 %. Reintroducing the Mediterranean diet (i. e. ∼ 35 % intake of animal protein) would therefore result in a significant decrease of GHG emissions from agricultural production systems under Mediterranean conditions...|$|R

IPA- 1) foi avaliado em um latossolo vermelho-amarelo de Arapiraca (AL) e em um planossolo solódico de Igaci (AL), ambos franco-argilo-arenosos. Doses de 30, 60 e 90 kg/ha de N foram aplicadas totalmente no sulco de plantio, totalmente em cobertura aos vinte dias após o plantio com ou sem incorporação, e 1 / 3 no sulco de plantio mais 2 / 3 em cobertura com ou sem incorporação. A produção de feijão aumentou com a dose de nitrogênio segundo equações quadrátricas. No latossolo vermelho-amarelo, o feijão respondeu à aplicação de nitrogênio até a dose de 66 kg/ha de N, enquanto no planossolo solódico a produção aumentou até a dose maior de 90 kg/ha de N. Os aumentos respectivos de produção em cada local foram de 22 % e 16 %. A aplicação de uréia de uma só vez em cobertura conferiu as menores produções, enquanto o fracionamento da dose em duas aplicações, bem como a adição única no plantio, foram os melhores métodos e igualmente efetivos.
