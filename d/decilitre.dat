25|$|Lead {{smelters}} {{contribute to}} several environmental problems, especially raised blood lead levels {{in some of}} the town population. The problem is particularly significant in many children who have grown up in the area. There is a government project to address this. Nyrstar plans to progressively reduce lead in blood levels such that ultimately 95% of all children meet the national goal of 10 micrograms per <b>decilitre.</b> This has been known as the tenby10 project. Community lead in blood levels in children are now at less than half the level that they were in the mid 1980s.|$|E

5000|$|Mass {{concentration}} (g/dL or g/L) is {{the most}} common measurement unit in the United States. Is usually given with dL (<b>decilitres)</b> as the denominator in the United States, and usually with L (litres) in, for example, Sweden.|$|R
50|$|In {{the code}} of the engine, the first two {{initials}} indicate engine class, the two numbers indicate engine displacement (in <b>decilitres),</b> the last two initials indicate cylinder-head style and induction type (D=DOHC, S=carburetor, E=injection). In {{the case of a}} single-initial suffix, the initial indicates induction type.|$|R
5000|$|The B21, {{and related}} red block motors, were named using the {{following}} convention: B##X or B##VX. Where B stands for [...] "bensin" [...] (gasoline), ## stands for the displacement in <b>decilitres,</b> and X is an appropriate suffix. On the later low-friction motors, V denotes SOHC configuration (0) or DOHC configuration (4, for 4 valves per cylinder).|$|R
5000|$|The {{test has}} a {{sensitivity}} of 94% and a specificity of 74% for identifying patients whose salicylate concentrations {{are greater than}} 30 mg per <b>decilitre</b> (2.17 mmol/L). [...] False positive concentrations (2.8 to 14.3 mg per <b>decilitre)</b> {{have been reported to}} occur in neonates with hyperbilirubinemia, premature neonates, and children who are seriously ill (e.g. children who have extensive burns).|$|E
50|$|Hemoglobin: The {{amount of}} {{hemoglobin}} in the blood, expressed in grams per <b>decilitre.</b> A {{low level of}} hemoglobin {{is a sign of}} anemia.|$|E

50|$|In {{countries}} where the metric system was adopted as the official measuring system after the SI standard was established, common usage more closely follow contemporary SI conventions. For example, in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, consumer beverages are labelled almost exclusively using litres and millilitres. Hectolitres sometimes appear in industry, but centilitres and <b>decilitres</b> are rarely, if ever, used. Larger volumes are usually given in cubic metres (equivalent to 1 kL), or thousands or millions of cubic metres.|$|R
5000|$|V6 and V8 models {{used the}} total {{displacement}} (in <b>decilitres)</b> {{for the first}} two digits and the number of cylinders as the third. Thus, the 206 was a 2.0 L V6 powered vehicle, while the 348 used a 3.4 L V8, although, for the F355, the last digit refers to 5 valves per cylinder. Upon introduction of the 360 Modena, the digits for V8 models (which now carried a name as well as a number) refer only to total engine displacement. The numerical indication aspect of this name carried on to the F430, however the F430's replacement, the 458 Italia uses the same naming as the 206 and 348.|$|R
5000|$|After a 30 {{months of}} development, the Ferrari 550 Maranello was {{presented}} in July 1996 at the Nürburgring racing circuit in Germany.The model name referred to the 5.5-litres total engine displacement in <b>decilitres</b> and {{to the town of}} Maranello, home to the Ferrari headquarters and factory.Pininfarina executed both the exterior and interior design.Frame and main engine components were shared with the 2+2 Ferrari 456, although at 2500 mm the 550's wheelbase was [...] mm shorter.In 2002 the 550 was replaced by the 575M Maranello, not an all-new model but rather an all-around improved version (modificata in Ferrari parlance) of the car, fitted with a larger 5.75-litre engine.In total 3,083 units of the 550 Maranello were produced.|$|R
50|$|Semi-quantitative {{values are}} usually {{reported}} as: trace, 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+; although tests {{can also be}} estimated as milligrams per <b>decilitre.</b> Automated readers of test strips also provide results using units from the International System of Units.|$|E
50|$|Metric prefixes {{are often}} applied, giving units like {{milligrams per litre}} (mg/L) or micrograms per <b>decilitre</b> (µg/dL). When {{measuring}} concentration in water, parts per million is an older expression of mg/L, since one litre of water under standard conditions weighs one kilogram.|$|E
50|$|The {{international}} standard way of measuring blood glucose levels are {{in terms of}} a molar concentration, measured in mmol/L (millimoles per litre; or millimolar, abbreviated mM). In the United States, West-Germany and other countries mass concentration is measured in mg/dL (milligrams per <b>decilitre).</b>|$|E
50|$|The car {{was named}} after its V8 engine: 24 is the {{capacity}} in <b>decilitres,</b> and 8 the number of cylinders. The name broke the F200x system used from 2001 to 2005, and returned to a system {{similar to that used}} in the 1950s and 1960s (cf. Ferrari 312) but they did revert to the previous system the following year with the F2007. The 248 model was driven by race drivers Michael Schumacher and Felipe Massa. The 248 F1 was the first Ferrari since the F1-2000 not to wear the number one, denoting that the driver is world champion. The car also featured new sponsor decals such as Martini. This was also Vodafone's last year of sponsorship for the Scuderia as they announced that they would switch to McLaren Mercedes as title sponsor. Ferrari used 'Marlboro' logos in Bahrain, Malaysia, Australia, Monaco, China and Japan.|$|R
5000|$|In English units, the cup {{derived from}} {{measures}} of liquid volume is also frequently used for {{small amounts of}} dry measure for fine or granulated bulk goods such as flour and sugar. In Europe, recipes normally weigh non-liquid ingredients in grams instead, using a kitchen scale, rather than employing volume units such as milliliters. For example, where an American customary recipe might specify [...] "1 cup of sugar and 2 cups of milk", a European recipe might specify [...] "200 g sugar and 500 ml of milk" [...] (or 0.5 litre or 5 <b>decilitres).</b> Conversion between the two measures {{must take into account}} the density of the ingredients, and some recipes specify both weight and volume to simplify. Many European measuring cups have additional [...] "weight scales" [...] besides the dL or mL scale for reckoning the weight common bulk ingredients like sugar, flour, or rice by their volume.|$|R
5000|$|In the SI system, use of prefixes for {{powers of}} 1,000 is {{preferred}} {{and all other}} multiples discouraged. However, in countries where the metric system was established well before {{the adoption of the}} SI standard other multiples were already established, their use remains common. In particular, use of the centi (10−2), deci (10−1), deca (10+1) and hecto (10+2) prefixes are still common. For example, in many European countries, the hectolitre is the typical unit for production and export volumes of beverages (milk, beer, soft drinks, wine, etc.) and for measuring the size of the catch and quotas for fishing boats; <b>decilitres</b> are common in Switzerland and Scandinavia and sometimes found in cookbooks; centilitres indicate the capacity of drinking glasses and of small bottles. In colloquial Dutch in Belgium, a [...] "vijfentwintiger" [...] and a [...] "drieëndertiger" [...] (literally [...] "twenty-fiver" [...] and [...] "thirty-threer") are the common beer glasses, the corresponding bottles mention 25&thinsp;cL or 33&thinsp;cL. Bottles may also be 75&thinsp;cL or half size at 37.5&thinsp;cL for 'artisanal' brews or 70&thinsp;cL for wines or spirits. Cans come in 25&thinsp;cL, 33&thinsp;cL and 50&thinsp;cL a.k.a. 0.5&thinsp;L.|$|R

50|$|The blood alcohol {{limit for}} {{commercial}} drivers is 0.04%. Pilots of aircraft may not fly within {{eight hours of}} consuming alcohol, while under the impairing influence of alcohol or any other drug, or while showing a blood alcohol concentration {{equal to or greater}} than 0.04 grams per <b>decilitre</b> of blood.|$|E
5000|$|The litre (equal to a cubic decimetre), {{millilitre}} (equal to a cubic centimetre), microlitre, {{and smaller}} are common. In Europe, the centilitre {{is often used}} for packaged products (such as wine) and the <b>decilitre</b> less frequently. (The latter two items include prefixes corresponding to an exponent that is not divisible by three.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Metric {{measuring}} spoons {{are available}} in sets, usually between four and six, typically with <b>decilitre</b> (100 ml), tablespoon (15 ml), teaspoon (5 ml) and millilitre measures. For fractional measures, {{there is often a}} line inside to indicate [...] "half" [...] or [...] "a quarter", or a separate measure may be included, like [...] dl.|$|E
5000|$|Milligrams per litre {{are often}} used in {{medicine}} and in medical prescriptions. For example, {{a description of a}} solution that involves two substances, where one of the substances involves adding water, would state: [...] "10 mg/L water and substance". (i.e. 10mg of substance for every L of water) Blood sugar concentration is sometimes measured in milligrams per <b>decilitre</b> (mg/dL).|$|E
50|$|According to The Daily Telegraph, Moore's fatal {{heart attack}} was {{brought on by}} a massive amount of alcohol he had {{consumed}} the evening of his death. Moore had 380 mg of alcohol per <b>decilitre</b> (100 millilitres) of blood (0.38%) in his system, which meant he was five times the legal drink driving limit. Blood alcohol content from 0.40% to 0.50% {{is considered to be}} lethal.|$|E
50|$|When CLEAR was launched, {{the blood}} lead level {{regarded}} as safe by the medical profession in the UK was 35 microgrammes per <b>decilitre</b> of blood. In 1991, the level deemed safe by the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) was lowered to 10, but CDC now accept {{that there is no}} safe threshold and define a level above 5 as a cause for concern.|$|E
50|$|Aldosterone-to-renin ratio can {{be given}} in ng/dL per ng/(mL·h), that is, {{nanogram}} per <b>decilitre</b> of aldosterone per nanogram per (millilitre x hour) of renin. Also, it {{can be given}} in pmol/liter per µg/(liter·h), where aldosterone is given in molar concentration. The former {{can be converted to}} the latter by multiplying with 27.6. Also, the inverse value is occasionally given, that is, the renin-to-aldosterone ratio, whose value is the multiplicative inverse of the aldosterone-to-renin ratio.|$|E
50|$|In {{human blood}} plasma, the {{reference}} range of uric acid is typically 3.4-7.2 mg/dL (200-430 µmol/L) for men, and 2.4-6.1 mg/dL for women (140-360 µmol/L) - one milligram per <b>decilitre</b> (mg/dL) equals 59.48 micromoles/litre (µmol/L). Uric acid concentrations in blood plasma {{above and below}} the normal range are known as, respectively, hyperuricemia and hypouricemia. Likewise, uric acid concentrations in urine above and below normal are known as hyperuricosuria and hypouricosuria. Uric acid levels in saliva may be associated with blood uric acid levels.|$|E
50|$|However, by 1979, in {{the face}} of growing {{evidence}} of the harmful effects of lead on children’s behaviour, neuro-cognitive development and IQ, the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) commissioned a report under the Chairmanship of Professor Lawther. The subsequent report, Lead and Health recommended that the lead content of petrol should be reduced from 0.4 to 0.15g/L, but there was no recommendation to introduce lead-free petrol. Nor was there any recommendation to lower the lead level deemed safe from 35 microgrammes per <b>decilitre</b> of blood.|$|E
50|$|In {{the health}} care system, metric units are often given {{precedence}} (for example, for measurements of blood cholesterol, the units are millimole per litre, whereas they are milligram per <b>decilitre</b> in the United States). Most physicians chart patient height and weight in imperial units, and while most growth charts display both systems of measurement, the majority of hospitals officially document such parameters in metric. Dieticians still use kilocalories, and doctors use millimetres of mercury. While these units are technically metric, they are not metric units.|$|E

5000|$|A {{proteinuria}} {{of greater}} than 3.5 g /24 h /1.73 m2 (between 3 and 3.5 g/24 h /1.73 m2 {{is considered to}} be proteinuria in the nephrotic range) or greater than 40 mg/h/m2 in children. The ratio between urinary concentrations of albumin and creatinin can be used {{in the absence of a}} 24-hour urine test for total protein. This coefficient will be greater than 200-400 mg/mmol in nephrotic syndrome. This pronounced loss of proteins is due to an increase in glomerular permeability that allows proteins to pass into the urine instead of being retained in the blood. Under normal conditions a 24-hour urine sample should not exceed 80 milligrams or 10 milligrams per <b>decilitre.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Prior to 1979, {{the symbol}} [...] (script small l, U+2113), came into common use in some countries; for example, it was {{recommended}} by South African Bureau of Standards publication M33 and Canada in the 1970s. This symbol {{can still be}} encountered occasionally in some English-speaking and European countries like Germany, and its use is ubiquitous in Japan and South Korea. Fonts covering the CJK characters usually include not only the script small [...] but also four precomposed characters: ㎕, ㎖, ㎗ and ㎘ (U+3395 to U+3398) for the microlitre, millilitre, <b>decilitre</b> and kilolitre. Such usage in printed works is {{in conflict with the}} recommendations published by the BIPM on the advice of the major international standards organisations (including ISO, NIST, NPL, IAU, IUPAC and IUPAP) who state in the SI Brochure that unit symbols should be [...] "printed in Roman (upright) type regardless of the type used in the surrounding text".|$|E
50|$|Alcohol is {{generally}} prohibited for Muslim {{consumers in the}} country as Malaysia's sharia law forbids Muslim from drinking and selling alcohol to them. Alcohol is mostly banned for Muslims in the states of Kelantan and Terengganu. Previously the legal age drinking for Malaysia is 18 years old and above, but effectively from 1 December 2017, the legal age drinking would be raised to 21. The legal limit for alcohol while driving in Malaysia is 80 milligrams per <b>decilitre</b> or 100 millilitres. Any vendors, restaurants and retailers need a license to serve or sell tap/draft beers, liquor and spirits in the country, but bottled and canned beers are exempted from such license requirements {{which is why it}} is common to find many vendors and coffee houses continue to serving alcohol in their premises without any license throughout the country. Malaysia also impose a nationwide regulations for vendors to place their alcoholic drinks into separate refrigerators or storage places, although this was opposed by certain vendors in the state of Penang. The high tax on alcohol has led to the increase price of alcoholic drinks in Malaysia, this has contributed to alcohol-related harm as many indigenous in the interior turn to unsafe alcohol that being smuggled from neighbouring countries.|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} century, {{there has been}} a steep decline in the {{incidence}} of industrial lead poisoning and a similar decrease, in the number of deaths due to lead poisoning. However, many people are chronically exposed to high atmospheric lead concentrations, which although not causing lead poisoning, may cause subclinical effects, i. e. metabolic disturbances undetectable by usual clinical procedures. Table 1 compares the lead concentrations in an uncontaminated environment with today's levels and their effects on body lead [...] The 'safe' upper limit is considered to be about 70 ug of lead per <b>decilitre</b> of blood.

40|$|In 2007, Queensland Health {{completed}} {{a study in}} Mount Isa of children between one and four years old {{in order to determine}} blood lead levels in this age group. Results of the study indicated that the average blood lead level (geometric mean) for the group sampled was 4. 97 µg/dl (micrograms per <b>decilitre).</b> This study of 400 children identified that 45 children (11. 3 per cent of those in the study group) had blood lead levels {{greater than or equal to}} 10 µg/dl. Of these, two had blood lead levels greater than 20 µg/dl. In 2010, Queensland Health commenced a second study in Mount Isa of children aged one to four years in order to continue to monitor blood lead levels in this age group. Results of this study indicate that the average blood lead level (geometric mean) for the group sampled was 4. 27 µg/dl. This study of 167 children identified that eight children (4. 8 per cent of those in the study group) had blood lead levels greater than or equal to 10 µg/dl. Of these, one had a blood lead level greater than 20 µg/dl. Statistical analyses revealed a significant decline between this survey and the 2007 survey in both the geometric mean blood lead levels and the percentage of children’s blood lead levels at or above 10 micrograms per <b>decilitre</b> (µg/dl). While care should be taken in interpreting such declines, the results do however indicate a step in the right direction...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the risk of}} lead poisoning among household members exposed to 'backyard ' battery repair shops' (BBRS) in Kingston, Jamaica, environmental and blood lead (PbB) were measured at 24 households (112 individuals) with a BBRS worker or located at a BBRS premises and at 18 neighbourhood control households (74 individuals). Ele-vated PbB (S = 25 micrograms per <b>decilitre</b> [ng/dl]) was common among subjects of all ages living at BBRS premises, especially among children less than age 12, 43 % of whom had PbB greater than 70 u. g/dl. Potentially hazardous soil and house dust lead levels were also common at BBRS premises, where 84 % of yards had soil lead levels above 500 parts per million (geometric mean 3388 parts per million [ppm] at BBRS premises households with a BBRS worker). Geomet-ric mean blood and environmental lead levels were significantly lower at control households, where less than 10 % of subjects in all age groups had elevated PbB (maximum 33 ng/dl). Sharing a premises with a BBRS was a stronger deter-minant of household blood lead and environmental contamination than was {{the presence of a}} BBRS worker in a house-hold. Blood lead levels were associated with soil and house dust lead levels in all age groups. We conclude that small battery repair shops, which have also been described in other developing countries, create a high lead poisoning risk for nearby residents. Lead is used in a number of processes by hobbyists and in small workshops, where a lack of measures to mon...|$|E
