25|$|Another {{analytic}} proof can {{be obtained}} along this line of thought observing that, since |p(z)|>|p(0)| outside D, the minimum of |p(z)| on the whole complex plane is achieved at z0.

Applying Liouville's theorem, which states that a bounded <b>entire</b> <b>function</b> must be constant, this would imply that 1/p is constant and therefore that p is constant.
