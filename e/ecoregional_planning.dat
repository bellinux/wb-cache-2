40|$|The {{development}} of Reimaanlok, a national {{framework for the}} planning and establishment of community-based conservation areas in the Marshall Islands, is outlined. A team composed of international experts and local resource management professionals selected and modified an <b>ecoregional</b> <b>planning</b> approach, defined key concepts, selected conservation features and targets, compiled biogeographical information from scientific and local knowledge and carried out a national-level ecological gap assessment. Past {{development of}} community-based fisheries and conservation plans was reviewed and the lessons learned informed {{the development of a}} robust community-based planning process for the design and establishment of conservation areas on individual atolls, integrating ecosystem based management (EBM) theory, traditional knowledge and management, and the particular socio-economic needs of island communities. While specific geographic, historical, cultural and economic characteristics of the Marshall Islands have created a framework that is unique, several aspects of this process offer ideas for national strategic conservation planning in other Small Island Developing States where there is a paucity of scientific data, significant and increasing threats, and where decision-making about the use of natural resources occurs primarily at the local level...|$|E
40|$|In 1996 The Nature Conservancy (TNC) {{developed}} an ecoregional approach to conservation, outlined in Conservation by Design: A Framework for Mission Success (TNC 1996), stating that biodiversity conservation requires working at larger scales and along ecological instead of geopolitical lines. Ecoregions, large units {{of land and}} water delineated by characteristic biotic and abiotic factors, provide a better geographic basis than states for organizing our conservation priorities and actions. Ecoregions encourage {{us to look at}} many species and ecological communities at once, and they provide a structure for capturing genetic and ecological variability within species or communities. The Nature Conservancy will complete <b>ecoregional</b> <b>planning</b> efforts in the 63 domestic ecoregions (Map 1) by the end of 2001. The major products of an ecoregional plan include: 1) identification of a suite of sites that, if protected, collectively conserve the biodiversity of the ecoregion, 2) identification of data gaps {{to improve the quality of}} future conservation decision-making and 3) an implementation plan to protect sites, including strategies and conservation partners. This report includes the suite of sites and the identification of data gaps. The East Gulf Coastal Plain ecoregion encompasses portions of five states (Georgia, Florida...|$|E
40|$|The Atlantic Forest {{is one of}} {{the most}} biologically diverse as well as {{enormously}} endangered rainforests on Earth. Recovering forest cover will be one of the greatest challenges to ensure biodiversity conservation and the maintenance of ecological services in this forest. High human activity has caused only 7 % of the original forest-cover to remain as a highly fragmented landscape. This ecoregion has the largest remaining forest blocks, still containing top predators such as harpy eagles and jaguars. An <b>ecoregional</b> <b>planning</b> process (biodiversity vision) developed by WWF indicates that protecting and ensuring connectivity between the larger forest remnants will enable rural communities to conserve biodiversity and ensure ecological services. Nowadays, these fragments are not effectively connected yet. Misiones Province, in Argentina, has the largest forest remnants, covering water courses and river basin heads. Many of these remnants are found in protected areas — Iguazu National Park and the Urugua-í and Foerster provincial parks — however connectivity between them is far being achieved yet. The challenge for this area is to stop deforestation and forest degradation, and to increase connectivity between forest remnants while improving the living standard of local people, thus providing them with new sustainable economic alternatives...|$|E
40|$|The. Systems Research Network for <b>Ecoregional</b> Land Use <b>Planning</b> in Support of Natural Resource Management in Tropical Asia (SysNet). was financed {{under the}} Ecoregional Fund, {{administered}} by the International Service for National Agricultural Research (ISNAR). The objective {{of the project was}} to develop and evaluate methodologies and tools for land use analysis, and apply them at the subnational scale to support agricultural and environmental policy formulation. In the framework of this project, the land use planning and analysis system LUPAS was developed. In this volume, the highlights of the project period between October 1999 and June 2000 are illustrated through presentations {{of the results of the}} most recent scenario analyses for the four case study regions (Haryana State, India; Kedah- Perlis Region, Malaysia; Can Tho Province, Vietnam; and Ilocos Norte Province, Philippines). Subsequently, special attention is paid to the development and description of the user interface and interaction with the stakeholders in the case study areas. The volume concludes with a brief outline of the most important challenges ahead...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an introduction and overview {{for the special}} issue on systematic conservation planning in the species-rich and highly vulnerable Cape Floristic Region. Firstly, we outline the three major problems that created {{the need for a}} systematic conservation plan and implementation programme in the region, namely an existing reserve system that is not representative of biodiversity patterns and processes, escalating threats to biodiversity, and diminishing institutional capacity. Secondly, we present the framework used for the planning and implementation process, place the contributions to the special issue in this context, and summarise current implementation initiatives. Thirdly, we extract from these studies and our own experience a number of lessons that were learnt during the planning process. Foremost amongst these lessons is a requirement for effective incorporation of implementation issues at all stages of the planning process. Other lessons include the need to consult and involve stakeholders at the local (municipal) level, the importance of a common planning framework for all teams contributing to the plan, the importance of mainstreaming biodiversity concerns as an implementation mechanism, the requirement for a critical level of home-grown capacity for undertaking <b>ecoregional</b> <b>planning,</b> and the value of expert knowledge when incorporated into a systematic planning framework. We conclude by suggesting that the approach used in this planning process, modified by accommodating the lessons learnt, has general applicability...|$|E
40|$|This United States Forest Service (USFS) site {{provides}} {{maps and}} descriptions of R. G. Bailey's ecoregion designations of the United States. An ecoregion is a large area defined by climate, landforms, and native species. Many federal agencies and private organizations use a system of land classification based on the ecoregion concept. On this site, after a brief explanation and history about ecoregion designations within the USFS, the user is presented with three ecoregion maps. Each of the maps represents different scales of analysis used in <b>ecoregional</b> <b>planning.</b> The ecosystem domain map, the broadest of all the maps, provides information on four defined domains in the United States: polar, humid temperate, dry, and humid tropical. Domains are subdivided into more detailed classifications that are displayed in the remaining two maps. The second map shows each of Bailey's nineteen ecosystem divisions, while the ecosystem province map shows the thirty-four smallest categories used by Bailey. Each domain, division, and province is hyperlinked to a general geographic description. Three appendices are provided throughout the site: regional climates based on the Koppen system of classification, climate diagrams of representative climate stations, and approximate area and proportionate extent of ecoregions at the province level in the United States. A list of references is also provided. Educational levels: Graduate or professional, High school, Undergraduate lower division, Undergraduate upper division...|$|E
40|$|The 49 th {{parallel}} border {{dividing the}} Great Plains region {{has been described}} since its delimitation as an ‘artificial’ construct, as no natural features distinguish the ‘Canadian’ and ‘American’ portions of the landscape. While the border subjects the landscape to different political, legal, philosophical, and sociocultural regimes on either side, the region’s contemporary and emerging environmental problems span jurisdictional boundaries. Their mitigation requires new forms of environmental management capable of transcending these borders. In this dissertation, I examine the prospects for implementing ecosystem-based approaches to environmental management in the Frenchman River-Bitter Creek (FRBC) subregion of the Saskatchewan-Montana borderland. First, I interrogate {{the extent to which}} residents perceive the FRBC region as a ‘borderland’. Then, I examine the range of implications of ecosystem-based management approaches for institutional arrangements, environmental governance, and traditional property regimes and livelihoods in the region. The research methodology includes an extensive literature review; multiple site visits to the FRBC region; a series of semi-structured interviews with employees of government agencies and environmental nongovernmental organizations, and with local agricultural producers; the analysis of historical maps and of selected <b>ecoregional</b> <b>planning</b> documents; and attendance at public meetings in the FRBC region. The research results are presented in a series of four manuscripts. The first manuscript describes perceptions of the border and the borderland through time. The second manuscript examines changes to the border and the relationships across it instigated by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2003 BSE Crisis. The third manuscript examines {{the extent to which a}} ‘shared landscape’ transcends the border, and describes how the different regimes across the border create ‘divergent visions’ for landscape and species management. The fourth manuscript investigates the ways in which incorporating a broader range of actors and disciplines could reconceptualize environmental management as an inclusive processes that is cognizant of local history and values. By examining the imbrications of the fields of environmental management, border studies, and political ecology, this research advocates adopting an historical approach to environmental geography research so that contemporary problems may be understood within their local contexts. It emphasizes the importance of including a range of stakeholders in environmental management processes. It identifies the difficulties inherent to adopting ecosystem-based approaches to management, and stresses the practical value of transboundary collaboration for goal setting so that the tenets of ecosystem-based management may be achieved under the existing jurisdictional frameworks in place. It provides significant insights for policy makers, in that it presents residents’ reflections upon their involvement in environmental management processes, and upon the impacts that recent changes to border and national security policies have had upon borderland residents. Moving forward, this research uncovers the need for continued investigations of the impacts of border security policies and legislation on borderland communities and species, for more study of the ability of state agencies to meaningfully incorporate local actors in environmental management, and for investigations of trinational environmental management efforts in the North American Grasslands...|$|E
