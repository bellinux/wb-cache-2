500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] {{begins with}} the sound of brass tinkling along, as Madonna chimes the opening line: [...] "Come on girls, do you believe in love? 'Cause <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>{{something}}</b> to say about it, And it goes something like this." [...] Handclaps and drum beats start as Madonna moves into the chorus of the song, with a thick vocal texture and high-pitched background singing. The chorus is aided by instrumentation from a saxophone and percussion. Madonna then sings the first verse of the song, as a violin sound is added after she finishes the bridge, [...] "Make you feel like a queen on the throne, make you love it till you never come down", a male voice repeating the last line. A synthesizer is played after the second verse as Madonna continues chanting the words [...] "Express yourself" [...] with background vocals singing [...] "Hey, hey, hey, hey" [...] alongside her.|$|E

[...] "We [...] just plugged along, hoped for the best and took it in our stride. [...] "I wasn't nervous; I was pretty casual [...] I could always handle a bat; I thought, 'I'll either get runs or I won't'." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Cheer up, Rosanna!" [...] I said. [...] "You mustn't fret {{over your}} own fancies. <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>something</b> {{to say to}} you from Mr. Franklin." ...|$|R
60|$|AMAH. You no kill old amah. You want old amah. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>something</b> velly pletty for {{my little}} Daisy flower.|$|E
60|$|TANNER. [enigmatically] It {{happened}} just then that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>something</b> that I {{wanted to keep}} all to myself instead of sharing it with you.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{care what}} you was tellin' her. But <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>something</b> to tell you, Mister Man. My wife's made up your bed too many times to suit me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well; {{never mind}} {{chaffing}} about the money," [...] said Eustace; [...] "we haven't got it yet, for one thing. <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>something</b> to ask you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can go {{to church}} afterwards;--that is, if you like. I can't {{come to the house}} now, and <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>something</b> that <b>I</b> must say to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have taken}} me into your confidence, Miss Emily, as you promised--and <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>something</b> {{in my mind}} in consequence. May I mention it without giving offense?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I guess <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>something</b> {{for you at}} last. There's a bo on {{the wire}} that says he's just seen your man down near Shawnee. He {{wants to know if}} you'll split the reward with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's a white man," [...] said Dillon with a smile. [...] "To be {{his friend}} cost me high, but now I've cut out bets and cards, I'd sooner he'd got my money than another. You see, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>something</b> back. The fellow's big." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] Thirlwell declared. [...] "In fact, {{although}} her letters {{ought to have}} prepared me, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>something</b> of a surprise. She {{was not the kind}} of girl I had expected to meet. I understand she teaches at a Toronto school." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It can! I {{have been}} {{thinking}} about it ever since we came to this house. <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>something</b> to propose to you. Will you hear it, or not?" ...|$|R

[...] Clementina {{suffered}} the woful truth {{to be drawn from}} her. [...] "But you don't know whether it's so or not," [...] the landlady protested.|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't {{be able to}} {{give you}} a wedding present," [...] her brother ventured apologetically. [...] "Sarah won't hear of it. Says we didn't get none from my folks when we got married. But <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>something</b> for you just the same. A surprise. You'd never guess it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>something</b> {{to ask of}} my masters," [...] {{answered}} crabbed Mother Barbara. [...] "There {{are your}} letters, to begin with. Is {{it true that you}} are, all three of you, going to the theater to-night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'MY cock and MY basket!' {{interrupted}} he. 'And, {{if you are}} too {{deaf and}} too stupid to understand what that means, <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>something</b> which may help to teach you.' And opening the bag, he cried: 'Flack, flick, switch, be quick.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{answered}} the story-teller of the school, cheerfully. [...] "I'd rather listen to Dave, anyway, for <b>I</b> know he's <b>got</b> <b>something</b> worth telling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] {{replied the}} artist, [...] "your worship cannot but {{remember}} that I told you I had made more progress into my master's--I mean the learned Doctor Doboobie's--mystery than {{he was willing to}} own; and indeed half of his quarrel and malice against me was that, besides that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>something</b> too deep into his secrets, several discerning persons, and particularly a buxom young widow of Abingdon, preferred my prescriptions to his." ...|$|E
60|$|I was now {{returned}} to London, and though by the accident {{of the last}} adventure <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>something</b> considerable, yet I was not fond of any more country rambles, nor should I have ventured abroad again if I had carried the trade on {{to the end of}} my days. I gave my governess a history of my travels; she liked the Harwich journey well enough, and in discoursing of these things between ourselves she observed, that a thief being a creature that watches the advantages of other people's mistakes, 'tis impossible but that to one that is vigilant and industrious many opportunities must happen, and therefore she thought that one so exquisitely keen in the trade as I was, would scarce fail of something extraordinary wherever I went.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look out!" [...] said everybody, fencing {{at random}} and hitting at nothing. [...] "Hold him! Shut the door! Don't let him loose! <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>something!</b> Here he is!" [...] A perfect Babel of noises they made. Everybody, it seemed, was being hit all at once, and Sandy Wadgers, knowing as ever and his wits {{sharpened}} by a frightful blow in the nose, reopened {{the door and}} led the rout. The others, following incontinently, were jammed {{for a moment in}} the corner by the doorway. The hitting continued. Phipps, the Unitarian, had a front tooth broken, and Henfrey was injured in the cartilage of his ear. Jaffers was struck under the jaw, and, turning, caught at something that intervened between him and Huxter in the melee, and prevented their coming together. He felt a muscular chest, and in another moment the whole mass of struggling, excited men shot out into the crowded hall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now then, youngster, if I'm {{willing to}} trust that half-crown in your clutches, you may believe <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>something</b> {{to say to}} 'ee worth your while listenin' to; for you may see I'm not the man {{to give it to}} 'ee out o' Christian charity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Psha! {{you know}} what I mean. I might have had the {{feelings}} of a gentleman {{as well as the}} best man that ever was born. I haven't; but I have never done anything so mean as gambling. Now <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>something</b> else to tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Rachel always {{answered}} steadily: [...] "Not yet, Christie, not yet. <b>I</b> 've <b>got</b> <b>something</b> to {{do before}} I can think of doing any thing so beautiful as that. Only love me, dear, and some day I'll show you all my heart, and thank you as I ought." ...|$|R
60|$|By and by I came to dread those things; {{and this}} dread grew and grew and grew; grew until I got to anticipating {{them with a}} cold horror. For I was an {{indolent}} man, and not fond of letter-writing, and whenever these things came I had to put everything by and sit down--for my own peace of mind--and dig and dig until <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>something</b> {{out of my head}} which would answer for a reply. I got along fairly well the first year; but for the succeeding four years the Mark Twain Club of Corrigan Castle was my curse, my nightmare, the grief and misery of my life. And I got so, so sick of sitting for photographs. I sat every year for five years, trying to satisfy that insatiable organization. Then at last I rose in revolt. I could endure my oppressions no longer. I pulled my fortitude together and tore off my chains, and was a free man again, and happy. From that day I burned the secretary's fat envelopes the moment they arrived, and by and by they ceased to come.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, {{you could}} have knocked me down with a feather!" [...] she resumed. [...] "He {{telephones}} me awhile ago and says to be outside the back door at ten to-night, because he'd something {{he wanted to tell}} me. Of course he couldn't come in and tell it me here, because he'd been fired and everything. So I goes out, and there he is. 'Hello, kid!' he says to me. 'Fresh!' I says to him. 'Say, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>something</b> to be fresh about!' he says to me. And then he reaches into his jeans and hauls out the sparkler. 'What's that?' I says to him. 'It's an engagement ring,' he says to me. 'For you, if you'll wear it!' I came over so weak, I could have fell! And the next thing I know he's got it on my finger and--" [...] Celestine broke off modestly. [...] "Say, ain't it a beaut, honest!" [...] She gave herself over to contemplation once more. [...] "He says to me how he's on Easy Street now, or will be pretty soon. I says to him 'Have you got a job, then?' He says to me 'Now, I ain't got a job, but I'm going to pull off a stunt to-night that's going to mean enough to me to start that health-farm I've told you about.' Say, he's always had a line of talk about starting a health-farm down on Long Island, he knowing all about training and health and everything through having been one of them fighters. I asks him what the stunt is, but he won't tell me yet. He says he'll tell me after we're married, but he says it's sure-fire and he's going to buy the license tomorrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came to a}} {{place where}} there was lots of chips and turf, and I sat down on the trunk of a tree to think what I should do. And all of a sudden I saw a hole under the nut-tree, like a little grave. And it darted into me like lightning--I'd lay the baby there and cover it with the grass and the chips. I couldn't kill it any other way. And I'd done it in a minute; and, oh, it cried so, Dinah--I couldn't cover it quite up--I thought perhaps {{somebody}} 'ud come and take care of it, and then it wouldn't die. And I made haste out of the wood, but I could hear it crying all the while; and when I got out into the fields, it was as if I was held fast--I couldn't go away, for all I wanted so to go. And I sat against the haystack to watch if anybody 'ud come. I was very hungry, and I'd only a bit of bread left, but I couldn't go away. And after ever such a while--hours and hours--the man came--him in a smock-frock, {{and he looked at me}} so, I was frightened, and I made haste and went on. I thought he was going to the wood and would perhaps find the baby. And I went right on, till I came to a village, a long way off from the wood, and I was very sick, and faint, and hungry. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>something</b> to eat there, and bought a loaf. But I was frightened to stay. I heard the baby crying, and thought the other folks heard it too--and I went on. But I was so tired, and it was getting towards dark. And at last, by the roadside there was a barn--ever such a way off any house--like the barn in Abbot's Close, and I thought I could go in there and hide myself among the hay and straw, and nobody 'ud be likely to come. I went in, and it was half full o' trusses of straw, and there was some hay too. And I made myself a bed, ever so far behind, where nobody could find me; and I was so tired and weak, I went to sleep....But oh, the baby's crying kept waking me, and I thought that man as looked at me so was come and laying hold of me. But I must have slept a long while at last, though I didn't know, for when I got up and went out of the barn, I didn't know whether it was night or morning. But it was morning, for it kept getting lighter, and I turned back the way I'd come. I couldn't help it, Dinah; it was the baby's crying made me go--and yet I was frightened to death. I thought that man in the smock-frock 'ud see me and know I put the baby there. But I went on, for all that. I'd left off thinking about going home--it had gone out o' my mind. I saw nothing but that place in the wood where I'd buried the baby...I see it now. Oh Dinah! shall I allays see it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be {{the last}} for a long time at any rate. And as <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>something</b> to say, <b>I</b> might as well say it now. I have thought {{a great deal about the}} property,--the Belton estate, I mean; and I don't intend to take it as mine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you never}} broken a dog by showing him the whip, Anne? <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>something</b> {{to ask of}} you, and I wish to get you into a generous frame of mind first. Listen now, I am going to read you a few {{extracts}} from a past that is so vividly recorded here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes, it's a bottle," [...] {{said the}} woman, with an {{assumption}} of virtuous frankness. [...] "It's whisky; <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to have <b>something</b> to rub my rheumatism with." ...|$|R
