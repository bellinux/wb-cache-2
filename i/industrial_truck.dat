50|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>trucks</b> are {{trucks that}} are not {{licensed}} to travel on public roads (commercial trucks are licensed to travel on public roads). <b>Industrial</b> <b>trucks</b> are used to move materials over variable paths and when there is insufficient (or intermittent) flow volume such {{that the use of}} a conveyor cannot be justified. They provide more flexibility in movement than conveyors and cranes because there are no restrictions on the area covered, and they provide vertical movement if the truck has lifting capabilities. Different types of <b>industrial</b> <b>trucks</b> can be characterized by whether or not they have forks for handling pallets, provide powered or require manual lifting and travel capabilities, allow the operator to ride on the truck or require that the operator walk with the truck during travel, provide load stacking capability, {{and whether or not they}} can operate in narrow aisles.|$|R

50|$|When the country's {{manufacturers}} {{began to}} ramp up for World War II, Baker-Raulang {{was one of a}} handful of firms that produced electric <b>industrial</b> <b>trucks</b> and fork-lifts. In 1940 alone, more electric <b>industrial</b> <b>trucks</b> were ordered by the government than had been produced since their introduction in the teens. Critical shortages of copper combined with a lack of manufacturing capacity led Baker-Raulang (and the government) to the realization that gasoline powered truck and forklifts were the answer. Baker-Raulang produced as many electric and gasoline-powered vehicles as possible and helped regional automobile manufacturers re-tool in order to produce enough gasoline-powered fork lifts and bomb handling equipment to meet the Government's requirements.|$|R

Later, diesel engines were introduced, utilizing proprietary Lanova cylinder head designs, injection pumps and nozzles. These were known as Buda-Lanova diesel engines. Buda Engine Company was acquired by Allis-Chalmers in 1953. The Buda-Lanova models were re-christened [...] "Allis-Chalmers diesel".|$|E
50|$|A {{forklift}} (also called lift truck, fork truck, and forklift truck) is a powered <b>industrial</b> <b>truck</b> used to {{lift and}} move materials over short distances. The forklift {{was developed in}} the early 20th century by various companies, including Clark, which made transmissions, and Yale & Towne Manufacturing, which made hoists. Since World War II, the use and development of the forklift truck have greatly expanded worldwide. Forklifts have become an indispensable piece of equipment in manufacturing and warehousing. In 2013, the top 20 manufacturers worldwide posted sales of $30.4 billion, with 944,405 machines sold.|$|E
5000|$|Baker, Rauch & Lang's <b>Industrial</b> <b>Truck</b> Division {{introduced}} {{a number of}} new products in the early twenties including a ram truck for carrying heavy steel coils as well as a line of low-lift platform truck and cranes. The Hy-Lift platform truck was introduced in 1922, and an articulated sheet handler in 1923. This innovative electric unit had a pivoted platform that could load 10-foot steel sheets through a standard seven-foot railroad car door. They also developed a duplex or [...] "knee-action" [...] compensating suspension that pre-dated GM's duBonnet system by a number of years.|$|E

Both types could be fitted with bodywork {{for use as a}} bread barrow, a milk pram or an <b>industrial</b> <b>truck.</b> The chassis were made from square section tube, with all joints welded, and were fitted with a [...] motor, driving the rear wheels.

That pallet truck won a design excellence award from the American Iron and Steel Institute in 1965. Good design became part of Crown’s corporate strategy. [...] Crown focused on niche markets, which didn’t affect competitors whose bread and butter were gas trucks and electric rider trucks. In 1970, Levitz, the furniture discounter, placed an order for 67 Crown stockpickers, which got momentum for sales going. That year, Crown joined the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Truck</b> Association http://www.indtrk.org/ and opened a plant in Australia.|$|E
50|$|The canyon {{became a}} main {{transport}} corridor {{in the region}} during the 1880s. Settlers established a number of ranches in Nine Mile, and even a short-lived town named Harper. No longer heavily traveled, the rugged canyon road was used mostly for recreation and tourism {{through the end of}} the 20th century. The discovery of rich deposits of natural gas deep beneath the Tavaputs Plateau has brought an influx of <b>industrial</b> <b>truck</b> traffic since 2002. The large amounts of fugitive dust produced by the trucks' passage may be damaging the rock art. Public debate is ongoing about how best to balance energy development in the canyon against the preservation of its cultural resources.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, Hawker Siddeley {{bought a}} 50 per cent share in Crompton Leyland Electricars Ltd (CLE), from British Leyland.

Although most of the vehicles involved were <b>industrial</b> <b>trucks,</b> the 3-wheeled Brush Pony milk float was also included, and a number of these were subsequently manufactured at Tredegar.
