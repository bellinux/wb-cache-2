40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} {{adverse reactions}} to oral administration {{of a combination}} of praziquantel and pyrantel <b>embonate</b> or pyrantel pamoate, with or without oxantel <b>embonate,</b> in captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Design: Retrospective case series and case-control study. Animals: 16 captive cheetahs with signs of adverse reaction to oral administration of praziquantel and pyrantel, with or without oxantel <b>embonate</b> (affected group), and 27 cheetahs without such reactions (unaffected group), all from 3 independent facilities. Procedures: Medical records and postmortem findings for affected cheetahs were reviewed and compared with those of unaffected animals. Anthelmintic doses administered, age, and sex of cheetahs were compared between groups. Results: 3 reactions in affected cheetahs were fatal, whereas the remainder ranged from mild to severe. Postmortem examination failed to reveal any disease processes or conditions to explain the deaths. No differences in anthelmintic dose were identified between affected and unaffected cheetahs for all facilities combined, and no correlation existed between dose and reaction severity. No association with sex was detected, but affected cheetahs were significantly younger than unaffected cheetahs. This difference was not significant after controlling for facility. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Cheetahs were concluded to have had an adverse reaction to the praziquantel-pyrantel combination because of temporal proximity of onset of clinical signs to dose administration, similarity of signs to those reported for toxicosis in other species for these drugs, and a lack of other disease process or environmental explanatory factors. A highly cautious approach to the use of this drug combination is recommended for cheetahs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{elucidate}} the pharmacological bases of oral administration of Securidaca longepedunculata (S. longepedunculata) root extract as an anthelmintic in folkloric medicine. MethodsAlbino mice were infected with infective third (L 3) larval stage of Heligmosomoides polygyrus (H. polygyrus) by esophageal intubation. Following {{establishment of the}} adult worms in the intestine, the mice were treated with 0 – 2 000 mg/kg body weight (bw) of methanolic root extract of S. longepedunculata and 100 mg/kg bw of pyrantel <b>embonate,</b> the reference drug in vivo. Bioactivity and larvicidal effects of the extract were tested by exposing brine shrimps (Artemia salina) to 0. 00 – 1. 00 mg/mL and the L 3 stage of Heligmosomoides contortus (H. contortus) and H. polygyrus to 0. 00 – 2. 50 mg/mL of the extract in vitro. ResultsThe percentage yield of the extract was 7. 13 % w/w dry matter. The brine shrimps toxicity bioassay resulted in an LC 50 of 74. 18 μg/mL. The extract had a significant, dose–dependent larvicidal effect on the L 3 stage of H. contortus and H. polygyrus with the terminal effect of 75 % and 70 % at the highest exposure concentrations, respectively. The extract however, {{did not affect the}} number of worm eggs per gram (epg) of fecal materials (P< 0. 05) and total worm burden (twb) of adult H. polygyrus in infected mice. Treatment with pyrantel <b>embonate</b> significant reduced both the fecal egg count and twb to 0 compared to the untreated control (P< 0. 05). ConclusionsThese results indicate that S. longepedunculata root extract contains potent bioactive compounds and has larvicidal effect on L 3 stage of H. contortus and H. polygyrus, substantiating its use as anthelmintic in alternative medicine...|$|E

Potential risk factors for infection were identified by a questionnaire: dogs from rural areas significantly more often had hookworms and taeniid eggs in their feces when compared to urban family dogs. Access to small rodents, offal, and carrion was identified as risk factor for hookworm and Taeniidae, while feeding of fresh and uncooked meat {{did not result in}} higher prevalences for these helminths.

40|$|While {{anthelmintic}} {{resistance is}} now a widely recognized issue in the livestock industries, its existence within companion animal medicine has been rarely established conclusively. We undertook a placebo-controlled in vivo trial to measure the efficacy of pyrantel <b>embonate</b> against pooled isolates of the hookworm Ancylostoma caninum from Brisbane, Australia. A statistically significant fall in adult worm burden was observed among dogs in the pyrantel treatment group compared to the control dogs (178. 0 +/- 24. 5 versus 239. 7 +/- 14. 0; p= 0. 02), equating to an efficacy of just 25. 7 % (95 % Cl, 15. 0 - 35. 1 %), as based upon reduction in mean worm burden. Analysis of faecal egg count trends {{through the course of}} the study revealed that egg counts rose in both control and pyrantel-treated dogs, with a greater rise observed in the latter group (11. 6 +/- 8. 3 % versus 17. 3 +/- 7. 6 %; p= 0. 04), despite the decrease in adult worm numbers in this group. Our results indicate that high-level anthelmintic resistance does occur in companion animal medicine, and highlight the need for greater vigilance and more judicious use of anthelmintics in small animal practice. They further indicate that the faecal egg count reduction test needs to be used with caution with this parasite. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Triptorelin 6 -month {{formulation}} {{was developed}} to offer greater convenience to both patients and physicians by reducing the injection frequency. The efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety of a new 6 -month formulation of triptorelin were investigated over 12 months (48 weeks). The primary objective was to evaluate the formulation in achieving castrate serum testosterone levels (≤ 1. 735 nmol/L or ≤ 50 ng/dL) on day 29 and in maintaining castration at months 2 - 12. Absence of luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulation and change in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level were also assessed. Methods: An open-label, non-comparative, phase III study in 120 patients with advanced prostate cancer was conducted from July 2006 to August 2007 in private and public institutions in South Africa. Each patient received two consecutive intramuscular injections of triptorelin <b>embonate</b> (pamoate) 22. 5 mg at an interval of 24 weeks. In all patients, testosterone (primary outcome measurement) was measured at baseline and then every 4 weeks; LH was measured before and 2 hours after the two injections. PSA was measured on day 1 and at weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48. Adverse events were recorded at each visit. Results: In the intent-to-treat population, 97. 5 % (95 % CI 92. 9, 99. 5) of patients achieved castrate serum testosterone levels by day 29, and 93. 0 % (95 % CI 86. 8, 97. 0) maintained castration at months 2 - 12. After the second injection, 98. 3 % of patients showed absence of LH stimulation. The most frequent drug-related adverse events were hot flushes (71. 7 % of patients). No patient withdrew from the study {{as a result of}} an adverse event. Conclusions: The triptorelin 6 -month formulation was well tolerated and was able to achieve and maintain castration for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. By reducing the frequency of required injections, this new formulation offers a more convenient treatment regimen. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved. Articl...|$|E
40|$|Human organic anion-transporting {{polypeptide}} 1 B 1 (OATP 1 B 1) and OATP 1 B 3 {{are important}} hepatic uptake transporters. Early assessment of OATP 1 B 1 / 1 B 3 -mediated drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is therefore important for successful drug development. A promising approach for early screening and prediction of DDIs is computational modeling. In {{this study we}} aimed to generate a rapid, single Bayesian prediction model for OATP 1 B 1, OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15 and OATP 1 B 3 inhibition. Besides our previously generated HEK-OATP 1 B 1 and HEK-OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15 cells, we now generated and characterized HEK-OATP 1 B 3 cells. Using these cell lines we investigated the inhibitory potential of 640 FDA-approved drugs from a commercial library (10 μM) on the uptake of [3 H]-estradiol- 17 β-d-glucuronide (1 μM) by OATP 1 B 1, OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15, and OATP 1 B 3. Using a cut-off of ≥ 60 % inhibition, 8 % and 7 % of the 640 drugs were potent OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15 inhibitors, respectively. Only 1 % of the tested drugs significantly inhibited OATP 1 B 3, which was not sufficient for Bayesian modeling. Modeling of OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15 inhibition revealed that presence of conjugated systems and (hetero) cycles with acceptor/donor atoms in- or outside the ring enhance {{the probability of a}} molecule binding these transporters. The overall performance of the model for OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15 was ≥ 80 %, including evaluation with a true external test set. Our Bayesian classification model thus represents a fast, inexpensive and robust means of assessing potential binding of new chemical entities to OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15. As such, this model may be used to rank compounds early in the drug development process, helping to avoid adverse effects in a later stage due to inhibition of OATP 1 B 1 and/or OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15.
