40|$|MBA, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The Road Freight Industry {{accounts}} for 1 to 5 percent of most countries GDP (AECOM International Development, 2011). According to e-Natis there was 321 056 Trucks (<b>Heavy</b> <b>load</b> <b>Vehicle</b> GVM > 3500 kg) in South Africa by November 2009 (Arrive Alive, 2009). This relative big industry, {{according to the}} statistics, influences most other industries value chains. Vehicles are driven by trucks drivers, making driving trucks their living. These drivers have their own lifestyles and ways that they go about. This study focusses on the risk factors of truck drivers’ lifestyles, especially long-distance truck drivers. This mini-dissertation {{draws attention to the}} limited research done on lifestyle risk factors and occupational hazards of long-distance truck drivers in South Africa. Most of the legislation regulating road transport is old and outdated, and any existing legislation is not being enforced. The goal of the study is to draw closer attention to the impact of certain lifestyle risk factors, social behaviours and occupational stressors on the lives of long-distance truck drivers, their close families and communities. The research was based on a comprehensive literature review as well as an empirical investigation done in the Gauteng province. A total of 150 long-distance truck drivers participated in the empirical investigation, by completing anonymous questionnaires. It is the researcher’s hope that this mini-dissertation will aid the betterment of long-distance truck drivers’ lives, general health and to make South African roads safer for all road users.

40|$|Abstract. Manufacturing of {{leaf spring}} for {{automotive}} application to support <b>heavy</b> <b>load</b> <b>vehicles</b> such lorry and truck is a challenging process. This {{is due to}} the difficulty in fabricating the leaf spring exactly as per designed. The difference between the desired leaf spring shape and the actual fabricated shape is known as camber drop. The aim {{of this study is to}} establish the correlation between leaf spring specifications, camber drop and its processing parameters. The formulated equation can thus be used to predict the extent of camber drop and required action can be taken to reduce camber drop. This work was conducted by gathering data of variables suspected to influence camber drop, namely quenching camber, half-length of the spring, spring rate and end thickness of the spring. Regression analysis was conducted and the correlation between leaf spring’s specifications and camber drop is given. A mathematical model able to predict the extent of camber drop is formulated...|$|R

From the analytical result, we found that those basic slices of soil are such a kind of clay slice, within a very high density and visually emerged as peat soil. There are two weaknesses of this soil; first it has relatively low strength which cannot support the high embankment of the road, second it has relatively high consolidation settlement that will shape {{the surface of the}} road become scraggly and waven.

This is detected by the fuel injection system which delivers more fuel to provide more power. Once the vehicle reaches a constant speed and constant engine rpm, the load decreases significantly, and {{the pressure of the}} exhaust gases through the turbo drop. Boost and fuel delivery decrease, thus lowering fuel consumption to near the same levels as a naturally aspirated diesel engine. If, say, the vehicle starts climbing a gradient, the engine load increases and the turbocharger and fuel system provide more power. Extra fuel is delivered only when needed.|$|R
