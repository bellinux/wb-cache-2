40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> trading in {{financial}} markets based on a model with three types of traders: liquidity traders, market makers, and <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> traders. Our four main findings are: i) The price impact of the liquidity trades is higher {{in the presence of}} the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> trader and is increasing with the size of the trade. In particular, we show that the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> trader reduces (increases) the prices that liquidity traders receive when selling (buying) their equity holdings. ii) Although market makers also lose revenue to the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> trader in every trade, they are compensated for these losses by a higher liquidity discount. iii) <b>High</b> <b>frequency</b> trading increases the volatility of prices. iv) The volume of trades doubles as the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> trader intermediates all trades between the liquidity traders and market makers. This additional volume is a consequence of trades which are carefully tailored for surplus extraction and are neither driven by fundamentals nor is it noise trading.

40|$|AbstractSignal-averaged electrocardiograms (X, Y and Z leads) were {{acquired}} from 24 patients with {{coronary artery disease}} and recurrent ventricular tachycardia, 24 control patients with coronary artery disease and 23 normal subjects to assess the discriminant value of fast Fourier transformation of the entire late potential period of the QRS complex. Analysis of the vector magnitude in the temporal domain (25 to 250 Hz bandpass filters) measured <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS duration, the duration of terminal signals 25 Hz that were < 40 μV. Analysis in the frequency domain used a 120 ms window that encompassed (had onset with) all of the late potential, but the mean value was first subtracted to eliminate a direct current component. <b>High</b> <b>frequency</b> spectral areas (60 to 120 Hz) and the percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> (100 × [60 to 120 Hz/ 0 to 120 Hz]) were calculated. Results in both temporal and frequency domains were similar in control patients with coronary artery disease and normal subjects. Patients with ventricular tachycardia had a longer <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS complex (p < 0. 0001) and longer <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> terminal signals < 40 μV (p < 0. 0004), but not significantly lower voltage in the last 40 ms. The most useful temporal domain measurement was <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS duration (if ≥ 120 ms, odds ratio = 8. 2). Patients with ventricular tachycardia had increased <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> spectral areas (p < 0. 0002) in the late potential, and the percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> was especially increased (p = 0. 0000; if percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> ≥ 3. 1 %, odds ratio = 18. 4). The odds ratio and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were both greater for percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> than for <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS duration (p < 0. 03. All patients with ventricular tachycardia had a <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS complex ≥ 107 ms or percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> ≥ 3. 1 % (sensitivity 100 %). For a <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> QRS complex ≥ 107 ms and percent <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> ≥ 3. 1 %, specificity was 96 %.

Why do phase difference spectra always pull to 0 ◦ phase lag at <b>high</b> <b>frequencies?</b> Can we actually observe <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> waves (P ≤ 70 s) ?

We address these questions by comparing obser-vations obtained with Hinode/NFI with results from two 3 D numerical simulations (Oslo Stagger and CO 5 BOLD). Our results suggest that the observed <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> Doppler ve-locity signal is caused by rapid height variations of the velocity response function in an atmosphere with strong velocity gradients and cannot be interpreted as evidence of propa-gating <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> acoustic waves.
