40|$|This {{thesis is}} about folding an {{ergonomic}} stall <b>fork</b> <b>shaft</b> in the middle. Reason for the folding {{of the shaft}} is partly a customer wish but the main reason is {{the high cost of}} shipping. The cost of shipping will be relatively low if the package size is kept below the size of which the shipping company recommends. If you want to transport a package that is larger than the recommend size, the shipping cost well rise drastically. In this case, the cost of a package with size of one meter is deemed to be a profitable shipping cost. The problem is that the total length of the entire stall fork is 1. 5 meters, which increases the shipping cost by about 100 SEK per package. Therefore, the stall fork must be folded in the middle to become cheaper to ship. The task is to get on a good and inexpensive solution to a clutch mechanism that allows customers to very easily and simply connect the two shafts together. Because of the shaft being ergonomic, it reduces physical abrasion damages and therefore is the main selling argument. That’s why it is very important not to bring any changes to the ergonomic design or, in worst case, as little as possible. The result was a coupling out of a polymer material that divides the shaft approximately from the middle, has a low weight and is easy for the consumer to assemble the two parts of the shaft. The work was carried out by studies of different couplings {{to be able to come}} up with a number of different proposals for splitting of the shaft. Furthermore were different materials closely examined and manufacturing methods that the coupling can be manufactured by. The result was a prototype of coupling out of a polymeric material that divides the shaft approximately in the middle, has a low weight and is easy for the consumer to assemble the two shaft halves. The coupling consists of parts, male, female and a core in the middle to make the link robust...|$|E
50|$|In its {{original}} incarnation launched in 1983, the XJ900 had an air-cooled, double overhead camshaft, 853 cc 4-stroke, 4-cylinder, 8-valve engine. Originally {{fitted with a}} handlebar mounted bikini fairing, its handling came in for criticism. This was quickly replaced with a frame mounted upper fairing and retrofitted to all models. The 1983 XJ900 came with anti-dive front <b>forks,</b> <b>shaft</b> drive and has triple disc brakes (2 front, 1 rear).|$|R

All's over and lost now. But if ever I have that Varney within reach of a flight-shot, I will bestow a <b>forked</b> <b>shaft</b> on him; and that I swear by salt and bread." ...|$|R
50|$|The F23 has two gearsets on each {{of three}} {{parallel}} shafts - the input shaft, the output shaft, and the intermediate shaft. This three-shaft (also called three-axis) design results {{in a very short}} axial length for better packaging. There are three separate shift <b>fork</b> <b>shafts,</b> which hold three shift forks to activate the synchronizer rings for the two gearsets {{on each of}} the three gear <b>shafts.</b> The shift <b>forks</b> are activated by a cable system. The clutch release bearing is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that surrounds the input shaft in the clutch housing. A concentric slave cylinder allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated clutch and release bearing. The input shaft carries the 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, the intermediate shaft carries the 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and the output shaft carries the 5th and reverse gear synchronizer. The aluminium case contains a conventional final drive gearset.|$|R
50|$|Dresch et Cie (1920-1949) {{was one of}} France's more {{important}} motorcycle manufacturers. It was founded in Étampes, France by the eccentric multi-millionaire French-Algerian industrialist Henri Dresch, whose other business interests were to include an upmarket spa hotel. Within five months of its founding, {{it was able to}} rise to the forefront of its specialty, going on to use advanced designs such as press-steel frame and <b>forks</b> and <b>shaft</b> drives, and later moved to the Everest factory in Paris's 15th arrondissement.|$|R
50|$|Hewland Mk.III of 1962 {{became the}} first product for the public, which {{utilised}} the magnesium alloy case of the Beetle transaxle to house 5 pairs of bespoke straight-cut constant mesh spur gears with dog rings operated by custom-made brass shift <b>forks.</b> Gear selector <b>shaft</b> was located in the nose housing, unmodified as in the Beetle set up, facing rear-ward {{at the tail end}} of the box in the front-side-back position on a midship engine racing cars. The elimination of synchromesh parts provided the space for an additional pair of gears for the 5th speed.|$|R
50|$|The clutch and {{flywheel}} {{are mounted}} {{on the back of}} the engine block This part of the clutch is of aluminium and carries a friction surface of leather To make for a more gradual engagement a steel spring is set between the leather and the metal face. It is formed into a ring with projecting tongues which ac t as springs. The large spiral spring to hold the clutch in engagement is stationary. It acts on the fork imparting a sliding motion to the propellor shaft. A ball bearing takes the thrust between <b>fork</b> and the <b>shaft.</b> A long propellor shaft runs from the clutch to the gearbox's first motion shaft. This propellor shaft carries a flexible coupling and is splined to allow longitudinal movement together with the clutch. The gearbox is mounted between the back axle and the sprocket shaft for the chain drive.|$|R
