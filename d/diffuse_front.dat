50|$|Along a <b>diffuse</b> <b>front,</b> a broad area of low {{pressure}} {{in association with}} an upper-level low was noted several hundred miles northeast of Puerto Rico on June 8. After the circulation reformed within the area of stronger convection, the NHC estimated that Tropical Depression One developed at 18:00 UTC on June 11 about 535 mi (860 km) southeast of Bermuda. Initially, the system resembled a subtropical cyclone, due to its frontal characteristics. The nascent depression drifted northward for 24 hours, and during this time, it strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene at 12:00 UTC on June 12, based on Dvorak satellite classifications. The storm intensified further to its peak intensity at 00:00 UTC on June 13, with estimated maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of , based on ship reports and satellite. Subsequently weakening due to westerly wind shear, Arlene tracking westward on June 13 and turned northwest the following day. Because the steering current became poorly defined, it drifted starting on June 15, and executed a small cyclonic loop later that day. At 00:00 UTC on June 17, Arlene was downgraded to a tropical depression. Later that day, it passed about 115 mi east of Bermuda, where gale force winds and abnormally high tides were observed. The depression weakened further due to decreasing sea surface temperatures and dissipated early on June 18.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} nature of EUV waves through direct {{observations}} {{of the formation of}} a diffuse wave driven by the expansion of a coronal mass ejection (CME) and its subsequent separation from the CME front. The wave and the CME on 2011 June 7 were well observed by Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard Solar Dynamic Observatory. Following the solar eruption onset, marked {{by the beginning of the}} rapid increasing of the CME velocity and the X-ray flux of accompanying flare, the CME exhibits a strong lateral expansion. During this impulsive expansion phase, the expansion speed of the CME bubble increases from 100 km s$^{- 1 }$ to 450 km s$^{- 1 }$ in only six minutes. An important finding is that a diffuse wave front starts to separate from the front of the expanding bubble shortly after the lateral expansion slows down. Also a type-II burst is formed near the time of the separation. After the separation, two distinct fronts propagate with different kinematic properties. The <b>diffuse</b> <b>front</b> travels across the entire solar disk; while the sharp front rises up, forming the CME ejecta with the <b>diffuse</b> <b>front</b> ahead of it. These observations suggest that the previously termed EUV wave is a composite phenomenon and driven by the CME expansion. While the CME expansion is accelerating, the wave front is cospatial with the CME front, thus the two fronts are indiscernible. Following the end of the acceleration phase, the wave moves away from the CME front with gradually an increasing distance between them.

40|$|Abstract. Phase-field models havebecome {{popular in}} recent years to {{describe}} a host of free-boundary problems in various areas of research. The key point of the phase-field approach is that surfaces and interfaces are implicitly described by continuous scalar fields that take constant values in the bulk phases and vary continuously but steeply across a <b>diffuse</b> <b>front.</b> In the present contribution, a distinction is made between models in which the phase field can be identified with a physical quantity (coarse-grained on a mesoscopic scale), and models in which the phase field can only be interpreted as a smoothed indicator function. Simple diffuse-interface models for the motion of magnetic domain walls, the growth of precipitates in binary alloys, and for solidification are reviewed, and it is pointed out that is such models the free energy function determines both the bulk behavior of the dynamic variable and the properties of the interface. Next, a phenomenological phase-field model for solidification is introduced, and it is shown that with a proper choice of some interpolation functions, surface and bulk properties can be adjusted independently in this model. The link between this phase-field model and the classic free-boundary formulation of solidification is established by the use of matched asymptotic analysis. The results of this analysis can then be exploited to design new phase-field models that cannot be derived by the standard variational procedure from simple free energy functionals within the thermodynamic framework. As examples for applications of this approach, the solidification of alloys and the advected field model for two-phase flow are briefly discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Currently, in the {{photovoltaic}} industry, {{wet chemical}} etching technologies are used for saw damage removal and surface texturing. Alternative to {{wet chemical etching}} is plasma etching. However, as for example, the linear microwave plasma technique, developed by Roth&Rau, has not been implemented in the photovoltaic industry for etching, because of the very low etch rate (< 1 m/min) and {{the high cost of}} ownership related to the etching process. In this study, different front surface textured crystalline silicon wafers obtained by means of the linear microwave plasma technique and the expanding thermal plasma technique are investigated in terms of weighted reflection by using reflectometry (250 - 1200 nm) to study the optical properties of the textures in detail. In addition, atomic force microscopy is used to measure the surface topography to determine statistical roughness parameters, as presented in this paper. Effective light trapping can be obtained by multiple reflection s as well as by a graded layer, which leads to a <b>diffuse</b> <b>front</b> surface, or a combination of both. A graded layer can be described as a smooth transition with increasing refractive index from air to silicon with typical thickness of (200 ± 50) nm. We have found that the average plane tilt angle correlates to the measured weighted reflection. Moreover, we can determine from the aspect ratio whether the light trapping is effective by multiple reflections. From the roughness exponent, which is a measure for the micro roughness, we can determine whether the light trapping is effective by a graded layer...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was set up}} for the calculation of all parameters in sample zones in capillary zone electrophoresis. In this model, sample peaks are divided into small segments with varying sample component concentrations and all parameters of a segment can be calculated from the parameters of the preceding segment with a steady-state model, based on the mass balances of the co- and counter ions, the electroneutrality equation and the modified Ohm's law. In this way, non-steady-state electrophoretic processes can be estimated by a repeated application of a steady-state model. Although in this model only the electrodispersive effect is considered and other peak broadening effects, such as diffusion, are neglected, this model is very useful to obtain an insight into the electrophoretic separation procedure and to calculate how parameters change in a sample zone. Calculations with this model show that linear relationships are obtained between the concentration of the sample component and other parameters, such as the pH, concentrations of co- and counter ions, electric field strength and specific resistance in the sample zone, if the sample concentration is not extremely high. With this model electropherograms can be simulated on a spatial basis whereby all possible detector signals can be calculated. The combined effect of a change in pH, resulting in a change in effective mobility for weak acids and bases, and a change in the electric field strength leads to a change in the apparent mobility of the different segments of the sample peaks. For sample ions, both anions and cations, with a mobility higher than that of the co-ions of the background electrolyte a <b>diffuse</b> <b>front</b> side results from the calculations whereas tailing peaks are obtained for sample components with low mobilities...|$|E

40|$|Using Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy {{the average}} translational diffusion coefficients of bile salt-lecithin mixed micelles diffusing in amylopectin gels of varying concentration were measured, {{on the assumption}} that the diffusion coefficient was constant during diffusion. This assumption was examined based on quasielastic light scattering (QLS) measurements of the change in the mixed micellar size on dilution. The size increased significantly on dilution with a buffer without the bile salt, whereas the size was almost constant on dilution with a solution of the bile salt in the same buffer. Because bile salt molecules in intermicellar solution (being much smaller) diffuse much faster than the mixed micelles, the mixed micelles in the <b>diffusing</b> <b>front</b> can be treated as if diluted with the bile salt solution. Therefore their size will be constant during diffusion, validating the assumption of a constant diffusion coefficient. Based on this it is possible to show that the micelles diffuse with a diffusion coefficient of ∼ 10 − 11 m 2 s− 1, independent (within experimental error) of the amylopectin gel concentration over the range 5 %– 10 % w/w...|$|R

The use of very small soil columns (about 0. 4 mt of pore volumes) combined with relatively high flow rates (0. 1 - 0. 3 mL min(- 1)) allows to observe the entire breakthrough curve (adsorption and desorption front up to 5000 pore volumes) in reasonable experimental time, in reproducible conditions and without experimental drawbacks.

Our data have been analysed using two mathematical models: a lattice-based discrete model and a related continuum partial differential equation model. We obtain independent estimates of the random motility parameter, D, and the intrinsic proliferation rate, λ, and we confirm that these estimates lead to accurate modelling predictions {{of the position of}} {{the leading edge of the}} moving front as well as the evolution of the cell density profiles. Previous work suggests that systems with a high λ/D ratio will be characterized by steep fronts, whereas systems with a low λ/D ratio will lead to shallow <b>diffuse</b> <b>fronts</b> and this is confirmed in the present study.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a simple {{approach}} for {{the transfer of the}} passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) device structure from laboratory status to industrial manufacturing. The approach uses a thin layer of thermally grown oxide for the simultaneous passivation of both front emitter and rear surface. This Thermal Oxide Passivated All Sides (TOPAS) structure represents an industrially feasible design of the PERC concept, as we circumvent costly masking steps. Instead side selective, wet-chemical etching allows the realisation of a structure with a textured and <b>diffused</b> <b>front</b> surface and a plain, non diffused rear surface. The implementation of a selective emitter by laser-doping from a phosphosilicate glass source enables the use of screen-printed Ag front contacts.

This Thermal Oxide Passivated All Sides (TOPAS) structure represents an industrially feasible implementation of the PERC concept. Instead of using masking or sacrificial layers to obtain a structure with a textured, <b>diffused</b> <b>front</b> surface and a plain non-diffused rear surface, side selective wet chemical etching is chosen in this work, since it features a higher cost reduction potential.

40|$|EIT waves" are {{large-scale}} coronal bright fronts (CBFs) {{that were}} first observed in 195 Å images obtained using the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). Commonly called "EIT waves", CBFs typically appear as <b>diffuse</b> <b>fronts</b> that propagate pseudo-radially across the solar disk at velocities of 100 [...] 700 km s^- 1 with front widths of 50 - 100 Mm. As their speed {{is greater than}} the quiet coronal sound speed (c_s≤ 200 km s^- 1) and comparable to the local Alfvén speed (v_A≤ 1000 km s^- 1), they were initially interpreted as fast-mode magnetoacoustic waves (v_f=(c_s^ 2 + v_A^ 2) ^ 1 / 2). Their propagation is now known to be modified by regions where the magnetosonic sound speed varies, such as active regions and coronal holes, but there is also evidence for stationary CBFs at coronal hole boundaries. The latter has led to the suggestion that they may be a manifestation of a processes such as Joule heating or magnetic reconnection, rather than a wave-related phenomena. While the general morphological and kinematic properties of CBFs and their association with coronal mass ejections have now been well described, there are many questions regarding their excitation and propagation. In particular, the theoretical interpretation of these enigmatic events as magnetohydrodynamic waves or due to changes in magnetic topology remains the topic of much debate.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{fundamental}} challenge of forming an efficient contact between the p-type a-Si:H layer and n-type TCO's as contact layers in amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells. We point out the capability of Suns-V-oc measurements to give valuable insights into the formation of Schottky barriers and its influence on the solar cell fill factor FF. The influence of the a-Si:H(p) doping on the Schottky characteristic is shown for test structures and on device level. Test structures are used to probe the influence of various contact layers on the effective work function at the a-Si:H/contact layer interface. A very good correlation between the vacuum work function of different contact layers and the open-circuit voltage is observed for test structures. Therefore, we could demonstrate the work function mismatch between a-Si:H and ITO and a-Si:H and various metals as contact layers. For small area n-type silicon solar cells featuring an a-Si:H(p) rear emitter and a <b>diffused</b> <b>front</b> surface field (FSF), it is shown that by improving the carrier transport between the a-Si:H(p) and the contacting layer, ITO(n) or metal, FF above 80 % can be obtained. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a TCO is not mandatory for the rear SHJ emitter, which simplifies the cell structure and allows for proper junction engineering. We obtained high internal rear side reflection with a single metal layer and an efficiency of 22. 8 % for these TCO-less SHJ emitter solar cells.

40|$|As magmas {{rise toward}} the surface, they {{traverse}} {{regions of the}} mantle and crust {{with which they are}} not in equilibrium; to the extent that time and the intimacy of their physical contact permit, the melts and country rocks will interact chemically. We have modeled aspects of these chemical interactions in terms of ion-exchange processes similar to those operating in simple chromatographic columns. The implications for trace element systematics are straightforward: the composition of melt emerging {{from the top of the}} column evolves from close to that of the incipient melt of the column matrix toward that of the melt introduced into the base of the column. The rate of evolution is faster in the incompatible than the compatible elements and, as a result, the abundance ratios of elements of different compatibilities can vary considerably with time. If diffusion and other dispersive processes in the melt are negligible and if exchange between melt and solid rock is rapid, extreme fractionations may occur, and the change from initial to final concentration for each element can be through an abrupt concentration front. Integration and mixing of the column output in a magma chamber or dispersive processes within the column, in particular the incomplete equilibration between matrix and fluid due to the slow diffusion in the solid phases, may lead to <b>diffuse</b> <b>fronts</b> and smooth trace element abundance patterns in the column output. If the matrix material is not replenished, the chromatographic process is a transient phenomenon. In some geological situations (e. g., under island arcs and oceanic islands), fresh matrix may be fed continuously into the column, leading to the evolution of a steady state.

By using fs laser without a corrosive gas (under vacuum), M. Halbwax prepared micro- and nanostructured silicon for photovoltaic cells with different nanotexturization methods [21]. And the results demonstrate that the photocurrent owes an increase of ~[*] 30 % in the laser-modified areas. In this study, a photovoltaic structure is made by using a fs laser to illuminate a silicon wafer to achieve locally nanostructured forest (squares of 1  mm 2). After the laser structuring, the samples have been implanted by boron element using Plasma Immersion Technique (PULSION tool, developed by IBS) to form a p-n junction, followed by rapid thermal annealing (RTA) processing. The absorption of spike structured silicon wafer reaches 94 %, which {{is much higher than}} that of other structures such as penguin-like, pillars and pyramids, even the absorption of a flat silicon wafer is only 65 %. An average photocurrent of the unmodified silicon sample is on the order of 15  nA or even smaller. However, the photocurrent of the treated silicon sample is in the range from 19 to 21  nA, indicating an 25 ~ 30 % improvement in the photocurrent. There are several factors affecting the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of a cell based on black silicon. According to M. Halbwax, the IQE performance of laser-textured solar cells is not only limited by the non-optimized reflection, but also by the surface recombination [21]. And the latter becomes significant because of the large surface. This phenomenon also exists in other reported papers [22, 23]. As shown in Fig.  3, according to Hao-Chih Yuan, the results demonstrated by the IQE was effected significantly by etching times [24]. They fabricated solar cells based on one-sided black silicon wafers and double-side polished planar Si wafers, respectively. Then, the practical standard processes were used to produce a phosphorous <b>diffused</b> <b>front</b> side emitter and an aluminum-back surface field (Al-BSF). With the increased etching time of black silicon, the IQE decreases significantly at short wavelengths. This phenomenon is mainly owing to the high-doping effect and surface recombination mechanism existed in the nanostructured density-graded surface layer.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Modeling Diffusion and Buoyancy-Driven Convection with Application to Geological CO 2 Storage Rebecca Allen Geological CO 2 {{storage is}} an {{engineering}} feat {{that has been}} undertaken {{around the world for}} more than two decades, thus accurate modeling of flow and transport behavior is of practical importance. Diffusive and convective transport are relevant processes for buoyancy-driven convection of CO 2 into underlying fluid, a scenario that has received the attention of numerous modeling studies. While most studies focus on Darcy-scale modeling of this scenario, relatively little work exists at the pore-scale. In this work, properties evaluated at the pore-scale are used to investigate the transport behavior modeled at the Darcy-scale. We compute permeability and two different forms of tortuosity, namely hydraulic and diffusive. By generating various pore ge- ometries, we find hydraulic and diffusive tortuosity can be quantitatively different in the same pore geometry by up to a factor of ten. As such, we emphasize that these tortuosities should not be used interchangeably. We find pore geometries that are characterized by anisotropic permeability can also exhibit anisotropic diffusive tortuosity. This finding has important implications for buoyancy-driven convection modeling; when representing the geological formation with an anisotropic permeabil- ity, it is more realistic to also account for an anisotropic diffusivity. By implementing a non-dimensional model that includes both a vertically and horizontally orientated 5 Rayleigh number, we interpret our findings according to the combined effect of the anisotropy from permeability and diffusive tortuosity. In particular, we observe the Rayleigh ratio may either dampen or enhance the <b>diffusing</b> <b>front,</b> and our simulation data is used to express the time of convective onset {{as a function of the}} Rayleigh ratio. Also, we implement a lattice Boltzmann model for thermal convective flows, which we treat as an analog for CO 2 storage modeling. Our model contains the multiple- relaxation-time scheme and moment-based boundary conditions to avoid the numer- ical slip error that is associated with standard bounce-back. The model’s accuracy and robustness is demonstrated by an excellent agreement between our results and benchmark data for thermal flows ranging from Ra = 103 to 108. Our thermal model captures analogous flow behavior to that of CO 2 through fluid-filled porous media, including the transition from diffusive transport to initiation and development of convective fingering...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} of fully flexible micromorph tandem solar cells directly on low cost substrates like PET and PEN. The cells are deposited in nip/nip configuration on the plastic substrate coated with a highly reflecting Ag-ZnO back contact. Light trapping is achieved by combining a periodically textured substrate and a <b>diffusing</b> ZnO <b>front</b> contact. Single junction microcrocystalline cell with a stable efficiency of 8. 6 % and 8. 4 % are achieved with i-layer thickness of 1. 8 and 1. 2 µm respectively. In tandem devices we obtain an efficiency of 10. 9 % (initial) with an open circuit voltage of 1. 35 V and a FF of 71. 5 %. These cells are slightly top limited with 11. 26 and 11. 46 mA/cm 2 in the amorphous (270 nm thick) and the microcrystalline sub-cells (1. 2 µm thick), respectively. We introduce an intermediate reflector between the bottom and the top cell because it allows increasing the top cell current without compromising stability by a thicker absorber. We present results on ex-situ ZnO and a new material, a low refractive index P-doped silicon-oxygen compound deposited in-situ by plasma process, in the same reactor as the micromorph cell...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we present}} {{geometrical}} and kinematical analysis of Moreton wave observed in 2012 June 3 rd and July 6 th, recorded in H-α images of Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) archive. These large-scale waves exhibit different features compared to each other. The observed wave of June 3 rd has angular span of about 70 ^∘ with a <b>diffuse</b> wave <b>front</b> associated to NOAA active region 11496. It {{was found that}} the speed of the wave that started propagating at 17. 53 UT is about 931 ± 80 km/s. The broadness nature of this Moreton wave can be interpreted as the vertical extension of the wave over the chromosphere. On the other hand, the wave of July 6 th may be associated to X 1. 1 class flare that occurred at 23. 01 UT around the 11515 active region. From the kinematical analysis, the wave propagated with the initial velocity of about 994 ± 70 km/s which is in agreement with coronal shock velocity derived from type II radio burst observation, v∼ 1100 km/s. These two identified waves add the inventory of the large-scale waves observed in 24 th Solar Cycle. Comment: 2 pages, 4 figures, APRIM 201...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBy {{analytical}} methods we study the large time {{properties of the}} solution of a simple one-dimensional model of stochastic Stokes' drift. Semi-explicit formulae allow us to characterize the behaviour of the solutions and compute global quantities such as the asymptotic speed {{of the center of}} mass or the effective diffusion coefficient. Using an equivalent tilted ratchet model, we observe that the speed of the center of mass converges exponentially to its limiting value. A <b>diffuse,</b> oscillating <b>front</b> attached to the center of mass appears. The description of the front is given using an asymptotic expansion. The asymptotic solution attracts all solutions at an algebraic rate which is determined by the effective diffusion coefficient. The proof relies on an entropy estimate based on homogenized logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. In the traveling frame, the macroscopic profile obeys to an isotropic diffusion. Compared with the original diffusion, diffusion is enhanced or reduced, depending on the regime. At least in the limit cases, the rate of convergence to the effective profile is always decreased. All these considerations allow us to define a notion of efficiency for coherent transport, characterized by a dimensionless number, which is illustrated on two simple examples of traveling potentials with a sinusoidal shape in the first case, and a sawtooth shape in the second case...|$|R
40|$|The {{document}} attached {{has been}} archived {{with permission from}} the Australian Dental Association. An external link to the publisher’s copy is included. Qualitative polarized light microscopy and cross-sectional microhardness testing profiles were used to compare artificial root caries lesions with those naturally present in extracted human teeth. The artificial lesions were produced by immersion of roots with exposed windows in chemical buffers of acetate and lactate with no added enzymes or bacteria. The three buffer systems used produced lesions with the range of histological characteristics of natural lesions. These included a ‘body’ or ‘surface’ zone of the lesion when viewed in water, and a ‘frontal’ zone of reverse birefringence when viewed in quinoline. The ‘frontal’ zone was noted to first develop {{after three days of}} immersion in acetate buffer. Advanced natural lesions exhibited a wide, <b>diffuse,</b> advancing <b>front,</b> which was similar to that produced by 28 – 60 day lesions in acetate. Microhardness profiles of natural lesions could all be matched by {{one or more of the}} artificial lesions. The demineralizing process was seen to reduce mineral content across the lesion from 45 per cent in normal dentine to between 15 and 25 per cent. M. McIntyre, J. D. B. Featherstone and J. F...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCurrently leading {{crystalline}} {{solar cell}} technologies comprehend rear side passivation with local aluminium back surface field and dielectric reflection layer. For this purpose Centrotherm developed the centaurus technology, {{which is based on}} a rear side dielectric passivation and local aluminium BSF (LBSF) in combination with a laser <b>diffused</b> selective <b>front</b> side emitter. A major aspect of the developed technology is its compatibility for an upgrade of existing Al-BSF cell production lines and for turnkey lines as well. Moreover, the equipment required for the new technology is merely based on familiar technologies like wet etching, PECVD layer deposition, laser processing and screen printing. This conformity with common technologies and the simplicity and sustainability of their production implementation as well as the exceptional high cell efficiencies in production favour the new centaurus technology. In production average cell efficiencies well over 19 % have been achieved and best cell efficiencies of 19. 6 % were reached. Under laboratory conditions average cell efficiencies of module ready centaurus solar cells with rear side Ag pads reached 19. 7 %, with best cell efficiencies up to 19. 9 %. These results clearly indicate that the centaurus technology is approaching module ready solar cell efficiencies of 20 %. Assembled modules demonstrate the excellent power conversion of the centaurus solar cells. First environmental tests have been successfully passed...|$|R
40|$|The closed time-path (CPT) {{formalism}} is {{a powerful}} Green’s function formulation to describe nonequilibrium phenomena in field theory and it leads to a complete nonequilibrium quantum kinetic theory. In this paper we {{make use of the}} CPT formalism to write down a set of quantum Boltzmann equations describing the local number density asymmetries of the particles involved in supersymmetric electroweak baryogenesis. These diffusion equations automatically and self-consistently incorporate the CP-violating sources which fuel baryogenesis when transport properties allow the CP-violating charges to <b>diffuse</b> in <b>front</b> of the bubble wall separating the broken from the unbroken phase at the electroweak phase transition. This is a significant improvement with respect to recent approaches where the CP-violating sources are inserted by hand into the diffusion equations. Furthermore, the CP-violating sources and the particle number changing interactions manifest “memory” effects which are typical of the quantum transport theory and are not present in the classical approach. The slowdown of the relaxation processes may keep the system out of equilibrium for longer times and therefore enhance the final baryon asymmetry. We also stress that the classical approximation is not adequate to describe the quantum interference nature of CP-violation and that a quantum approach should be adopted to compute the sources since they are most easily built up by the transmission of low momentum particles...|$|R
