25|$|An <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> is {{a kitchen}} {{appliance}} used for whipping, beating, and folding food ingredients. It typically {{consists of a}} handle mounted over a large enclosure containing the motor, which drives one or two beaters. The beaters are immersed in the food to be mixed. The first <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> was invented by Rufus M. Eastman in 1885. U.S. patent #330,829 for the first <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> was filed by Eastman on March 6, 1885, and issued on November 17, 1885.|$|E
25|$|Mayonnaise {{can be made}} by {{hand with}} a whisk, or fork, or with the aid of an <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> or blender. It is made by slowly adding oil to an egg yolk, while whisking vigorously to {{disperse}} the oil. The oil and the water in the yolk form a base of the emulsion, while lecithin and protein from the yolk is the emulsifier that stabilizes it. A combination of van der Waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion determine the bond strength among oil droplets. The high viscosity of mayonnaise is attributed to the total strength created by these two intermolecular forces. Addition of mustard contributes to the taste and further stabilizes the emulsion, as mustard contains small amounts of lecithin. If vinegar is added directly to the yolk, it can emulsify more oil, thus making more mayonnaise.|$|E

50|$|When {{selecting}} a mixer, the purchaser should {{consider how the}} mixer will be used. <b>Electric</b> <b>mixers</b> with more speed options give the user {{more control over the}} development of the mixture.|$|R
50|$|With <b>electric</b> <b>mixers</b> {{and food}} {{processors}} commonly available in most household kitchens, {{people can make}} butter {{in their own homes}} without a large churn. These small appliances are used to mix the cream until it is close to forming solid butter. This mixture is then mixed by hand to remove the buttermilk and water.|$|R
50|$|For the dough, most {{versions}} {{still use}} 19th century ingredients such as potassium carbonate and ammonium carbonate as leavening agents {{to get the}} sticky and dense consistency of the original mixture. It is then either kneaded by hand or {{through the use of}} an <b>electric</b> <b>mixer.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{prepare an}} Angel Delight dessert, a single 59 g packet of dessert powder {{is added to}} a bowl {{containing}} 300 ml of milk.

They thought {{it was supposed to be}} funny...the show was such fun and such a fiasco".|$|E
50|$|Wet grinder {{consists}} of granite stones which rotate inside a metal drum {{with the help}} of an electric motor and the food grains get crushed between the stone and drum. Wet grinders have two advantages over <b>electric</b> <b>mixers</b> or blenders. First, the stone grinder generates less heat than a mixer and heat affects the flavor of the food. Second, the stones remain sharp for a greater time than do metal blades.|$|R
50|$|Small {{appliances}} {{are typically}} small household electrical machines,also very useful and easily carried and installed. Some are classified with white goods, and relate to {{heating and cooling}} such as: fans and window mounted air conditioners, and heaters such as space heaters, ceramic heaters, gas heaters, kerosene heaters, and fan heaters. Yet another category {{is used in the}} kitchen, including: juicers, <b>electric</b> <b>mixers,</b> meat grinders, coffee grinders, deep fryers, herb grinders, food processors, electric kettles, waffle irons, coffee makers, blenders and dough blenders, rice cookers, toasters and exhaust hoods.|$|R

5000|$|For the hour-long season 1 episode, [...] "Try to Remember," [...] {{originally}} {{broadcast on}} February 9, 1987, ALF tries to simulate a jacuzzi by bringing Kate's <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> into the bathtub, thus receiving an electrical shock that caused amnesia. Fusco ended the original episode {{with a public}} service announcement from ALF himself, warning of the dangers from mixing water and electricity. Despite this, NBC reported that a child attempted to recreate the scenario and nearly electrocuted himself in the process (Fusco confirmed {{that the child was}} unharmed); Fusco was forced to refilm the opening sequence, replacing the <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> with a manual egg beater. ALF's amnesia is instead caused by a cranial concussion received after slipping in the shower (a [...] "thud" [...] is heard rather than a [...] "zap"), with all mentions of being shocked either overdubbed with new dialogue or deleted entirely (including ALF's public service announcement). This edited version was utilized for a Fall 1988 rebroadcast, as well as all future U.S. and Canadian syndicated airings.|$|E
50|$|Sarawakian modern layered cakes can {{be divided}} into two categories: cakes with {{ordinary}} layers and cakes with patterns, motifs, or shapes. All must have at least two colours. The cake can be baked in an oven or microwave. The batter uses butter or vegetable oil, milk and eggs, and requires a strong arm or <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> to be properly prepared. The baked cake has a high, firm texture and the layers are fastened together with jam or a similarly sticky sweet substance. More detailed cakes often require special moulds to maintain the perfect layer thickness.|$|E
5000|$|The first mixer with {{electric}} motor {{is thought to}} be the one invented by American Rufus Eastman in 1885. [...] The Hobart Manufacturing Company was an early manufacturer of large commercial mixers, and they say a new model introduced in 1914 {{played a key role in}} the mixer part of their business. The Hobart KitchenAid and Sunbeam Mixmaster (first produced 1910) were two very early US brands of <b>electric</b> <b>mixer.</b> Domestic electric mixers were rarely used before the 1920s, when they were adopted more widely for home use.|$|E
5000|$|Wet {{grinding}} is rare {{in western}} cuisine but common in Indian cuisine. Wet grinders are used to make pastes from grains and lentils, such as those used in cooking dosas and idlis in South Indian cuisine. [...] These grinders generally consists of a few granite stone plates that are rolled against another stone plate with the items to be ground between them. Wet grinders have two advantages over <b>electric</b> <b>mixers</b> or blenders. First, the stone grinder generates less heat than a mixer; heat affects {{the flavor of the}} food. Second, the stones remain sharp for a greater time than do metal blades.|$|R

50|$|The {{biggest impact}} of early mass {{production}} was in manufacturing everyday items, {{such as at}} the Ball Brothers Glass Manufacturing Company, which electrified its mason jar plant in Muncie, Indiana, USA around 1900. The new automated process used glass blowing machines to replace 210 craftsman glass blowers and helpers. A small electric truck was used to handle 150 dozen bottles at a time where previously a hand truck would carry 6 dozen. <b>Electric</b> <b>mixers</b> replaced men with shovels handling sand and other ingredients that were fed into the glass furnace. An electric overhead crane replaced 36 day laborers for moving heavy loads across the factory.|$|R
50|$|Banana cake is {{prepared}} using banana {{as a primary}} ingredient and typical cake ingredients such as flour, sugar, eggs, butter, margarine or oil and baking soda. The bananas can be mashed or puréed using {{a food processor or}} <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> and mixed into the cake batter, and the cake can also be topped or garnished with sliced bananas. Banana cake may be prepared as a use for browned or overly-ripe bananas. Chocolate may be used as an ingredient, which along with the banana is an enjoyable flavor combination for some people. Nuts such as walnuts and macadamias may be used in the batter and to top and garnish the cake.|$|E
50|$|In Greece, one of {{the most}} popular coffees is a {{variation}} of iced coffee called Frappé, invented by a Nescafe represenatative Dimitrios Vakondios in 1957. The preparation entails instant coffee (traditionally Nescafe), water, and optionally, sugar, together using either an <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> or a shaker to create a foam. Subsequently, milk is optionally added followed by ice cubes, and the remainder is topped with water. It became well known outside of Greece as a result of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, during which many tourists became fond of it and an article in the Los Angeles Times was published about it.http://www.latimes.com/features/printedition/food/la-fo-frappe18aug18,1,6434354.story?coll=la-headlines-pe-food Since its founding, Frappe became a very popular drink in Cyprus, and in Romania.|$|E
50|$|Concave cakes are {{commonly}} made with eggs, egg yolk, low gluten flour, honey {{and a small}} portion of sugar. Regardless of ingredients, the procedure for making the cakes is fairly consistent in all recipes. First, preheat the oven at around 170 degree Celsius, at the same time, mix the 1 eggs and 3 egg yolks by adding sugar and honey which depend on preference. The mixture will be creamed by using a wooden spoon or <b>electric</b> <b>mixer.</b> The gluten flour will be added and stir them softly for a while. Then, pour the mixture into molds. Place them into the oven and adjust to 170 degrees Celsius for 16 minutes. Someone may prefer to well done, then prolong the time to 20 minutes.|$|E

5000|$|A Victoria sponge is {{made using}} one of two methods. [...] The {{traditional}} method involves creaming caster sugar with fat (usually butter), mixing thoroughly with beaten egg, then folding flour and raising agent into the mixture. The modern method, using an <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> or food processor, involves simply whisking all the ingredients together until creamy. [...] Additionally, the modern method typically uses an extra raising agent, and some recipes call for an extra-soft butter or margarine. Both the traditional and modern methods are relatively quick and simple, producing consistent results, making this type of mixture {{one of the most}} popular for children and people in a hurry. This basic [...] "cake" [...] mixture has been made into a wide variety of treats and puddings, including cupcakes, chocolate cake, and Eve's pudding.|$|E

At St. Paul, all of the blind, including the elderly, were taught to do {{as much as they could}} do for themselves. The name of the hall (as part of St. Paul's) was changed to St. Raphael's Geriatric Adjustment Center for the Blind and the Visually handicapped. Skills taught included operating power tools including a buzz saw, and cooking using an <b>electric</b> <b>mixer</b> and gas stove. In addition to building skills, each blind person developed confidence and independence.|$|E

50|$|After a while, Marc Anthony {{takes the}} kitten {{into the kitchen}} and {{attempts}} to scold it, but when he hears his owner walking toward the kitchen, he hastily hides the kitten in a flour canister and tries to look innocent. Growing tired of his antics, his owner evicts him from the kitchen and tells him to stay out while she bakes cookies. Marc Anthony watches as his owner scoops out a cup of flour, and is horrified to see that the kitten is in the measuring cup. The lady pours the flour, along with the kitten, into a mixing bowl and prepares to use an <b>electric</b> <b>mixer.</b> The bulldog tries several times to thwart her, finally spraying his face with whipped cream to make himself appear rabid, resulting in his disbelieving and exasperated owner throwing him out of the house. Meanwhile, the kitten climbs out of the bowl and hides behind a box of soap flakes to clean itself up.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the ratio}} of {{ingredients}} and mixing and cooking times, some recipes are optimized to produce a softer, chewy style cookie while others will produce a crunchy/crispy style. Regardless of ingredients, the procedure for making the cookie is fairly consistent in all recipes: First, the sugars and fat are creamed, usually {{with a wooden spoon}} or <b>electric</b> <b>mixer.</b> Next, the eggs and vanilla extract are added followed by the flour and leavening agent. Depending on the additional flavoring, its addition to the mix will be determined by the type used: peanut butter will be added with the wet ingredients while cocoa powder would be added with the dry ingredients. The titular ingredient, chocolate chips, as well as nuts are typically mixed in {{towards the end of the}} process to minimize breakage, just before the cookies are scooped and positioned on a cookie sheet. Most cookie dough is baked, although some eat the dough as is, or use it as an addition to vanilla ice cream to make chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.|$|E
50|$|Place the flour, baking powder, {{salt and}} mace {{in a medium}} bowl. Stir with a wire whisk to combine. Set aside. In a large bowl of an <b>electric</b> <b>mixer,</b> cream {{together}} the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs and mix until creamy. Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll {{the dough into a}} 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining fastnachts.|$|E
50|$|In 1908 Herbert Johnson, an {{engineer}} for the Hobart Manufacturing Company, invented an <b>electric</b> standing <b>mixer.</b> His inspiration came from observing a baker mixing bread dough {{with a metal}} spoon; soon he was toying with a mechanical counterpart. By 1915, his 20 gallon (80 l) mixer was standard equipment for most large bakeries. In 1919, Hobart introduced the Kitchen Aid Food Preparer (stand mixer) for the home.|$|R
50|$|Stacks are {{significantly}} {{more expensive and}} more land consuming than other four-way interchanges, and additionally may suffer from objections of local residents, because of their height and high visual impact. Large stacks with multiple levels may have a complex appearance and are often colloquially described as Mixing Bowls, Mixmasters (for a Sunbeam Products brand of <b>electric</b> kitchen <b>mixers),</b> or as Spaghetti Bowls or Spaghetti Junctions (being compared to boiled spaghetti).|$|R
50|$|The {{baking area}} {{is called the}} amasijo, from the word for “to knead.” It {{is set in the}} back of the establishment. The back area contain various tables, mixers and other equipment, the most notable of which is the oven, usually set into one wall. These ovens can be gas or firewood. Older {{bakeries}} in small towns may have ovens large enough to walk into with the wood added from an outer door. The flour initially left to ferment with yeast is called madre (mother), and bits of this used to prepare various types of dough. The mixing and kneading of large quantities of ingredients is now done by commercial <b>electric</b> <b>mixers.</b> However, the final kneading in smaller batches is still done by hand by most baking businesses. Pastries are made by the most experienced bakers who have a higher status, often the master baker and/or owner of the bakery. The various stages of bread making occur at the same time in the different stations, with rising and already baked breads on racks in certain corners. These racks are usually of metal but some older wooden ones can still be found. Cleaning is a constant activity to keep up with the constant baking during shifts.|$|R
