The use of back <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> has been forwarded as a counter measure towards reducing low-back injuries in the industrial setting. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if a back <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> relieves stresses encountered by the lumbar spine during stoop type lifting and potentially reduce the risk of injury. METHODS: Twelve male participants (49. 7 ± 3. 7 years) performed two sessions of stooped type lifting with a loaded milk crate (11. 5 kg), at 4 repetitions per minute, for 15 minutes in accordance with the NIOSH lifting equation. One lifting session was performed without a <b>support</b> <b>belt,</b> while the other with a <b>support</b> <b>belt.</b> Three sets of fluoroscopic images were collected with the participants positioned at the initiation (flexed trunk), mid-range, and completion of the lift (erect standing). The first series of images were collected under a no-load condition, while the second (no <b>support</b> <b>belt)</b> and third series (<b>support</b> <b>belt)</b> of images were collected with the participants lifting the 11. 5 kg milk crate. Images were imported into AutoCAD where lumbar disc deformation and joint angles were measured by calculating changes in position of adjacent vertebra (L 3 - 4 and L 4 - 5). A reduction of disc deformation was deemed indicative of reduced stress. RESULTS: Analysis of variance revealed that compressive and shear disc deformation were reduced while in the erect trunk posture for the <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> condition (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). No significant reduction in disc deformation was detected while in flexed trunk postures for the <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> condition (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: During stoop type lifting, <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> provide a measurable amount of stress reduction of the lumbar spine when the trunk is in the erect posture, with little effect during flexed trunk positions...|$|R
40|$|This {{study reveals}} how {{a group of}} workers {{perceive}} the effectiveness of back <b>support</b> <b>belts,</b> how they are implemented in selected industries, and how they effect the lifting styles of those who wear them. A close-ended questionnaire was distributed to 150 workers who have worn the belts {{at least six months}} and who were at the time employed on a full-time basis. Seventy questionnaires were completed from individuals in the greater Portland metropolitan area. The results show that the majority of workers believe that 1) back <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> are efective in preventing back injuries; 2) back <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> increase their lifting awareness; 3) back <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> change how they lift; 4) they do not lift more weight with the belts on, than they would lift without them and; 5) that wearing the back <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> does not make the workers stronger. The data was analyzed using percentages to describe the central tendencies (mode) of all occupations combined and Chi-squares to determine significant differences between the separate occupations. The level of significance used was 0. 05. The data showed that workers in the sample occupations studied perceive back <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> to be an effective tool in the prevention of back injuries...|$|R

This article aims {{to review}} the {{literature}} published {{to date on the}} types, current use, the biomechanical effects and adverse effects of maternity <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> for low back pain during pregnancy, to identify future research directions. Background. Lumbar/pelvic <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> are frequently recommended for the prevention and treatment of low back pain during pregnancy. Design. Systematic review. Methods. MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and patents databases were electronically searched. Results. Maternity <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> belong to one of the four main types of maternity support garments, which are widely commercially-available. Current research showed limited evidence in support of the commercial maternity products regarding the effectiveness in the prevention and/or treatment of low back pain during pregnancy, other than that from the manufacturers. However, potential stabilisation effect of maternity <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> was demonstrated in some studies. Adverse effects reported include increased pain, fetal heart rate changes, skin irritation and discomfort. Conclusions. There is insufficient scientific evidence to conclude that wearing maternity <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> reduces pregnancy-related low back pain and/or pelvic girdle pain. Future research directions in the area of biomechanics and physiology are recommended. Relevance to clinical practice. This review provides comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of maternity <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> for the relief of low back pain during pregnancy which will facilitate healthcare professionals in providing evidence-based advice to their patients.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the technique of the individual, using an integrated biomechanical approach, to assess injury potential and performance. The effects of five neoprene athletic supports were investigated for the cricket bowl and javelin throw. A significant improvement in distance thrown {{and an increase in}} linear speed of body segmental movements were found for a lumbar <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> during the javelin throw. A two-handed overhead throwing activity was designed to investigate the effect of this lumbar <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> during the hyperextension - flexion movement of the torso. Significant differences in the distances thrown and segmental timing during the belt condition were found for both novice and experienced athletes. An integrated approach (three-dimensional cinematography, ground reaction forces and electromyography) was then used to analyse the effect of this lumbar <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> during the delivery phase of both sporting activities. The rate at which the torso uncoiled, (the relative peak shoulder to peak hip speed) was found to be significantly different during the belt condition for both activities.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Study Design. This study {{investigated}} {{the effects of a}} lumbar <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> on lumbar disc deformation and joint angles. Trunk strength and endurance were also compared to disc deformation and joint angles to determine if any meaningful relationships existed. Objective. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if back <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> relieve stresses encountered by the lumbar spine during lifting activities and thus reduce the risk of injury. Additionally, trunk strength and endurance measures were collected in order to determine if strong, well conditioned trunk musculature aids in the support of the lumbar spine. Summary of Background Data. Low-back pain and injury are responsible for a major portion of lost work days and injury compensation claims. Back <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> have been proposed as a counter measure towards reducing low-back injuries in the industrial setting. Methods. Twelve male subjects (average age, 49. 7 years) performed two sessions of stoop type lifting with a loaded milk crate (11. 5 kg), at a rate of 4 repetitions per minute, for a total 15 minutes per session in accordance with the NIOSH 1993 lifting equation. The order of testing with and without a belt was randomized for the two sessions. Fluoroscopic images were collected prior to and following both lifting sessions. Fluoroscopic images were collected with the subjects positioned at the initiation (flexed trunk), mid-range, and completion of the lift (erect standing). Images were imported into Auto Cad where lumbar disc deformation and joint angles were measured by calculating changes in position of adjacent vertebra (L 3 - 4 and L 4 - 5). A reduction of deformation was deemed indicative of reduced stress. Trunk extension and flexion strength were measured with a Kin Com isokinetic dynamometer. Trunk flexion endurance was measured via a 60 second curl-up test. Results. Analysis of variance revealed that compressive and shear disc deformation were reduced while in the erect trunk posture for the <b>support</b> <b>belt</b> condition (p. 05). A significant inverse relationship was detected (p< 05) between: abdominal strength and shear stress (flexed trunk positions), abdominal endurance and shear stress (erect trunk), and spinal erector strength and L 4 -L 5 joint angle (erect trunk). Conclusions. During stoop type lifting, <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> provide a measurable amount of stress reduction of the lumbar spine when the trunk is in the erect posture, with little effect during flexed trunk positions.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{response}} of annealed (float) glazing during long-duration blast {{as a function of}} glazing thickness, area, aspect ratio and <b>edge</b> <b>support</b> conditions. With positive phase durations in excess of 100 ms, long-duration blasts produce substantial impulse and pronounced dynamic pressures. Transient dynamic response of annealed glazing during these events is a complex phenomenon dependent upon explosive proximity, structural arrangement and material properties. In particular, breakage time and initial fracture location are dictated by maximum principal stress exceedence at randomly distributed micro-flaws. As part of a larger research study, twelve full-scale air-blast trials employing 24 annealed glazing panels were conducted with ~ 14 kPa peak static overpressure and ~ 110 ms positive phase duration. Results are reported, where it is shown that notionally elastic <b>edge</b> <b>supports</b> can prevent glazing breakage versus rigidly clamped arrangements when suitable panel dimensions are employed. Fragmentation modes are also demonstrated to be a strong function of edge conditions with elastically supported panels producing large, angular fragments. In contrast, rigid arrangements are shown to induce localised impulsive stress transmission at clamped edges, leading to significant cracking and small fragments. Substantially different fragment masses and geometries demonstrate the need to accurately quantify <b>edge</b> <b>supports</b> when appraising fragment hazard. Quantification of peak panel deflection, breakage time and applied breakage impulse is then presented where results indicate the influence of <b>edge</b> <b>supports</b> and aspect ratio on glazing response to be dependent on proximity to the threshold area for a particular thickness...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of structural arrangement on long-duration blast loaded annealed glazing via variable thickness, area, aspect ratio and <b>edge</b> <b>support</b> conditions. Initially, the findings of eighteen full-scale air-blast trials employing 33 annealed glazing panels are reported where it is demonstrated that fracture mode and fragmentation are a strong function of <b>edge</b> <b>supports.</b> Rigidly clamped <b>edges</b> are shown to induce localised stress transmission, producing significant cracking and small fragments. In contrast, elastic edges are shown to produce large, angular fragments, demonstrating the importance of accurately modelling edge conditions when analysing fragment hazard. Quantification of peak centre panel deflection and breakage time is then presented where variable results indicate {{the influence of}} <b>edge</b> <b>supports</b> and aspect ratio {{to be dependent on}} proximity to the threshold area as a function of glazing thickness. An initial Applied Element Method (AEM) analysis is then employed to model the influence of structural arrangement on long-duration blast-loaded annealed glazing. AEM models are shown to reasonably predict glazing fragmentation behaviour, breakage time and peak panel deflection at the moment of breakage. Thus indicating AEM's potential suitability to provide a predictive capacity for annealed glazing response during long-duration blast...|$|R

The reinforcement arrangement used is isotropic reinforcement. The yield line theory was used as the method of solution to obtain the ultimate load. To verify the analytical results, experimentally the six rectangular two- way slabs subjected to uniformly distributed load are simulated by 16 point loads with various combinations of the possible boundary conditions (simply <b>supported</b> at all <b>edges,</b> fixed <b>supported</b> at one short <b>edge</b> and simply <b>supported</b> at the remaining <b>edges,</b> fixed <b>supported</b> at one long <b>edge</b> and simply <b>supported</b> at the remaining <b>edges,</b> fixed <b>supported</b> at two short <b>edges</b> and simply <b>supported</b> at the other <b>edges,</b> fixed <b>supported</b> at two long <b>edges</b> and simply <b>supported</b> at the two short edges, and the last slab was fixed <b>supported</b> at all <b>edges.</b> Data of the experimental work including deflection readings, and yield line patterns are presented.) Experimental results are discussed and comparisons are made between the theoretical and experimental result. Finally conclusions are drawn and recommendations are presented. It can be concluded that the difference between the experimental and theoretical failure loads were small and mainly on the conservative side. Significant increase in load carrying capacity of isotropically reinforced fixed supported slabs is due to compressive membrane action imposed by horizontal restraints. Also similar yield line patterns for theoretical and experimental cases were observed...|$|R
