40|$|A {{relatively}} {{large number of}} salt caverns are used for fluid hydrocarbon storage, including an extensive set of facilities in the Gulf Coast salt domes for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) Program. Attention {{is focused on the}} SPR caverns because of available histories that detail events involving loss and damage of the hanging string casing. The total number of events is limited, making the database statistically sparse. The occurrence of the events is not evenly distributed, with some facilities, and some caverns, more susceptible than others. While not all of these events could be attributed to impacts from salt falls, many did show the evidence of such impacts. As a result, a study has been completed to analyze the potential for salt falls in the SPR storage caverns. In this process, it was also possible to deduce some of the cavern interior conditions. Storage caverns are very large systems in which many factors could possibly play a part in casing damage. In this study, all of the potentially important factors such as salt dome geology, operational details, and material characteristics were considered, with all being logically evaluated and most being determined as secondary in nature. As a result of the study, it appears that a principal factor in determining a propensity for casing damage from salt falls is the creep and fracture characteristics of salt in individual caverns. In addition the fracture depends strongly upon the concentration of impurity particles in the salt. Although direct observation of cavern conditions is not possible, the average impurity concentration and the accumulation of salt <b>fall</b> <b>material</b> can be determined. When this is done, there is a reasonable correlation between the propensity for a cavern to show casing damage events and accumulation of salt <b>fall</b> <b>material.</b> The accumulation volumes of salt <b>fall</b> <b>material</b> can be extremely large, indicating that {{only a few of the}} salt falls are large enough to cause impact damage...|$|R
50|$|When {{a star in}} {{a binary}} fills its Roche lobe (either due to being very close to its {{companion}} or having a relatively large radius), it begins to lose matter, which streams towards its neutron star companion. The star may also undergo mass loss by exceeding its Eddington luminosity, or through strong stellar winds, and some of this material may become gravitationally attracted to the neutron star. In the circumstance of a short orbital period and a massive partner star, both of these processes {{may contribute to the}} transfer of material from the companion to the neutron star. In both cases, the <b>falling</b> <b>material</b> originates from the surface layers of the partner star and is rich in hydrogen and helium. Because compact stars have high gravitational fields, the material falls with a high velocity towards the neutron star, usually colliding with other accreting material en route, and in so doing forming an accretion disk. In an X-ray burster, this material accretes onto the surface of the neutron star, where it forms a dense layer. After mere hours of accumulation and gravitational compression, nuclear fusion starts in this matter. Often the increase in temperature (greater than 1 × 109 kelvins) gives rise to a thermonuclear runaway. This explosive stellar nucleosynthesis begins with the hot CNO cycle which quickly yields to the rp-process. Within seconds most of the accreted material is burned, powering a bright X-ray flash that is observable with X-ray telescopes. Theory suggests that in at least some cases the hydrogen in the accreting material burns continuously, and that it is the accumulation of helium that causes the bursts.|$|E

40|$|Based on the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph observations, {{we study}} the {{response}} of a solar sunspot light wall to external disturbances. A flare occurrence near the light wall caused material to erupt from the lower solar atmosphere into the corona. Some material falls back to the solar surface and hits the light bridge (i. e., {{the base of the}} light wall), then sudden brightenings appear at the wall base followed by the rise of wall top, leading to an increase of the wall height. Once the brightness of the wall base fades, the height of the light wall begins to decrease. Five hours later, another nearby flare takes place, and a bright channel is formed that extends from the flare toward the light bridge. Although no obvious material flow along the bright channel is found, some ejected material is conjectured to reach the light bridge. Subsequently, the wall base brightens and the wall height begins to increase again. Once more, when the brightness of the wall base decays, the wall top fluctuates to lower heights. We suggest, based on the observed cases, that the interaction of <b>falling</b> <b>material</b> and ejected flare material with the light wall results in the brightenings of wall base and causes the height of the light wall to increase. Our results reveal that the light wall can be not only powered by the linkage of p-mode from below the photosphere, but may also be enhanced by external disturbances, such as <b>falling</b> <b>material...</b>|$|E

We exploit a panel dataset of 40 countries, accounting for 75 per cent of worldwide material extraction and 88 per cent of GDP, from 1995 to 2008. The results show that economic growth and structural change towards material-intensive countries explain most of the growth in global material use. Slight gains in material efficiency and falling importance of material-intensive sectors have decelerating effects. The country-level analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity.

This shift was particularly pronounced for construction minerals and investment, indicating that infrastructure investment in industrialising nations was a key driver.

30|$|Kirk was {{the next}} to put forward a general process on how to {{identify}} the area of origin based on damage. The focus of his process {{was similar to the}} others in describing that the area of origin will be located at the greatest area of damage and the investigators should focus on identifying the low burn damage areas and using conical shapes. He encouraged investigators to focus on low burns, because as he says “any low point in a burn should be investigated as a possible origin” (Kirk 1969). However, Kirk also identifies many of the “very common complications” that can arise, which will “distract the investigator from following the fire pattern back to its point of origin” (Kirk 1969). These deviations from ‘normal’ patterns, as he called them, included areas of open ventilation, secondary ignition of <b>falling</b> <b>material,</b> roof or attic fires, exterior exposure fires and roof collapse. He succinctly describes his process as “direction of spread of the fire will be noted…it will be upward, partially lateral, rarely downward, but its direction will indicate the general region of origin when properly interpreted. This should and generally is, close to the low point of the burn” (Kirk 1969).|$|E

The storm, which occurred in January 1998, is the worst on record in eastern North America; glaze ice on the order of 80 – 100 mm accumulated at our study site. All but 3 % of the trees (DBH 10 cm) lost at least some crown branches, and 35 % lost more than half their crown.

40|$|Several {{federal and}} state {{agencies}} have promulgated regulations that require the installation of operator protective structures on mobile equipment used in mining, construction, agriculture and logging industries. These regulations cover {{many different types of}} vehicles, from small farm tractors to large rubber-tired front-end loaders, and require structures that help protect the operator from death or injury from vehicle overturns, from falling tree tops and logs, from falling rocks, and from tree limbs in clearing operations. Two general types of vehicle operator protective structures have evolved over the past twenty years. The first of these is the "Roll-Over Protective Structure'' or "ROPS" that is essentially a "roll bar" or "roll cage" that provides a relatively safe area for the vehicle operator if the vehicle should tip over and roll. The second protective structure is the "Falling Object Protective Structure" or "FOPS" that provides overhead protection against <b>falling</b> <b>material.</b> The terms "ROPS" and "FOPS" are often used interchangeably (sometimes inaccurately) with "cabs", canopies, "roll bars", protective structures" and other such descriptive names.
