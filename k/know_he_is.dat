5|$|In a {{move against}} the insurgency, the Cylons decide {{to have the}} NCP arrest 200 civilians {{they believe to be}} {{affiliated}} with the resistance. Headed by Jammer (Dominic Zamprogna), a former Galactica deckhand and resistance fighter, most of the arrests take place during the night. Those being arrested include Laura Roslin (Mary McDonnell), Tom Zarek (Richard Hatch) and Cally Henderson Tyrol (Nicki Clyne). Learning of Cally's arrest, Jammer attempts to get her released by Boomer, but Boomer is unable to help. After another suicide bombing at a power station, the Cylons decide to have the prisoners executed, but require President Gaius Baltar's (James Callis) signature. When he refuses to sign, an Aaron Doral (Matthew Bennett) copy forces him to at gunpoint. Caprica-Six (Tricia Helfer) attempts to stop him, but Doral shoots her in the head. Baltar signs the document. Meanwhile, Ellen Tigh (Kate Vernon) learns from Cavil (Dean Stockwell) that he only released her husband Saul (Michael Hogan) because the Cylons <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> leading the resistance. He informs Ellen that unless she tells the Cylons where the resistance leaders will be meeting next, he will imprison Saul once more. Reluctantly, Ellen discovers where the resistance plans to meet with members from the colonial fleet.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} of Spooks saw various storylines {{involving}} the main characters. Among these were Danny's obsession {{with money and}} spending, by hacking into a credit card database to fool it {{to give him a}} better credit rating, and the discovery that Tessa is running phantom agents to pocket their money. Those storylines were intended by Brenton and Wolstencroft to show the audience that the MI5 officers are tempted by money. A principle story arc is Tom dealing with the complexities of his relationship with Ellie, who at first does not <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a spy. This storyline was based on Mike Baker, whose wife did not know he was a spy {{for the first six months}} they were together. As the series progressed, there were more difficulties with the relationship; Brenton wrote Tom's position as if the character did not see the problem. The same episode also introduced the sexual tension between Danny and Zoe.|$|E

500|$|An {{important}} {{consequence of}} Gregory's {{belief in the}} infinity of God is his belief that God, as limitless, is essentially incomprehensible to the limited minds of created beings. In Life of Moses, Gregory writes: [...] "...every concept that comes from some comprehensible image, by an approximate understanding and by guessing at the Divine nature, constitutes a idol of God and does not proclaim God." [...] Gregory's theology was thus apophatic: he proposed that God should be {{defined in terms of}} what we <b>know</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> not rather than what we might speculate Him to be.|$|E

New signing Yoann Arquin became the County's first choice striker, and Hughes announced his intention to leave the club in order to find first team football. He was reported to have joined Port Vale on loan, with a view to a permanent move, on 22 November 2012; though the deal had yet to be ratified by the Football League. However, the next day it was revealed that the loan move would not go through as the relevant paperwork had not been sent in on time. Three weeks later Hughes provided the club with a sick note, saying that he was unavailable until January. His contract was terminated by mutual consent on 7 January 2013.|$|E
500|$|In a brief dissent, Evans {{argued that}} Oppenheimer's {{security}} clearance should be reinstated.

[...] Evans said that his association with Chevalier did not indicate disloyalty, and that he did not hinder development of the H-bomb. Evans said he personally thought that [...] "our failure to clear Dr. Oppenheimer will be a black mark on the escutcheon of our country," [...] and expressed concern about the effect an improper decision might have on the country's scientific development.|$|E
500|$|The 100m at the DN Galan {{meeting in}} Stockholm saw Gay's first match-up {{of the year}} against Bolt. He {{surprised}} the Olympic and World champion with a resounding victory, beating him with 9.84 to Bolt's 9.97seconds. This was {{only the second time}} Bolt had lost a 100m final – the first occurring in July 2008 against Powell (also at Stockholm Olympic Stadium). Gay broke Powell's stadium record and earned a one carat diamond for the feat. Gay chose not to overstate the significance of the win, acknowledging that Bolt was far from peak fitness: [...] "It feels great to beat Usain but deep down inside I <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not 100%. I look forward to beating him when he is". With Bolt and Powell both out with injuries, Gay won unchallenged at the London Grand Prix the following week, running a world leading time of 9.78seconds despite poor weather. A victory at the Memorial van Damme in 9.79seconds earned him the first Diamond Race Trophy for the 100m.|$|E

500|$|In 1915, the {{children}} of an unknown family living in a Devonshire rectory wrote to express their disappointment in {{the lack of a}} sequel to Mr. Tod. Potter enjoyed continuing the lives of her characters through these letters and responded:It is sad to have caused such disappointment! [...] I think I saw Tommy Brock's wife last week. I couldn't think who the person reminded me of, and when I read your letter I remembered directly! I am not sure how many of a family there are [...] lots! and what we call a [...] "long" [...] family, all ages with some long time between. I believe Tommy Brock is very grumpy with the grown-up ones, and makes them clear off into the woods; and, as you <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not often at home himself. Mrs. Badger is rather lighter coloured than he is, rather sandy, with little piggy eyes and a snouty nose, and a not particularly clean house, I should say [...] she finishes wearing out Tommy's celebrated boots.

500|$|The album {{opens with}} the first single [...] "Gimme More", a dance-pop and electropop song. The song opens with a spoken intro in which Spears says the line [...] "It's Britney, bitch". The lyrics appears to be about dance and sex, {{although}} they are actually about the media's fascination with her private life, {{as noted in the}} lines [...] "Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancin' / They keep watchin', keep watchin'". The next song and second single, [...] "Piece of Me" [...] runs through a down-tempo dance beat and consists of over-the-top vocal distortions, causing a split sound effect and making it difficult to discern which voice is Spears'. It talks about fame and is written like a biography retelling her mishaps, while she sings in a nearly spoken manner. The third track of the album, [...] "Radar", is an electropop and Euro disco song which features distorted synthesizers emulating sonar pulses, that received comparisons to those of Soft Cell's [...] "Tainted Love" [...] (1981). In the lyrics, Spears lets the subject <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> on her radar, while she lists the qualities the man has.|$|E
500|$|Hundreds of extras {{were brought}} in to shoot the picture, and some 300 pilots were {{involved}} in the filming. Because the aerial battles required ideal weather to shoot, the production team had to wait on one occasion for 18 consecutive days for proper conditions in San Antonio. If possible, Wellman attempted to capture footage in the air in contrast to clouds in the background, above or in front of cloud banks to generate a sense of velocity and danger. Wellman later explained, [...] "motion on the screen is a relative thing. A horse runs on the ground or leaps over fencers or streams. We <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> going rapidly because of his relation to the immobile ground". Against the clouds, Wellman enabled the planes to [...] "dart at each other", and to [...] "swoop down and disappear in the clouds", and to give the audience the sense of the disabled planes plummeting. During the delay in the aerial shooting, Wellman extensively rehearsed the scenes for the Battle of Saint-Mihiel over ten days with some 3500 infantrymen. A large battlefield with trenches and barbed wire was created on location for the filming. Wellman took responsibility for the meticulously-planned explosions himself, detonating them at the right time from his control panel. According to Peter Hopkinson, at least 20 young men, including cameraman William Clothier, were given hand-held cameras to film [...] "anything and everything" [...] during the filming.|$|E
