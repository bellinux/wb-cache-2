40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the strategies for controlling and monitoring water quality in the Central African Water Distribution Company. Several important monitoring measurements were done to ascertain the water quality {{at different stages of}} the production line, such as physico-chemical, limnology and bacteriological. According to the results, sometimes the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls</b> undergoes a modification in time. This justifies the reduction of the number of controls. The breaking-off the reagent causes also a reduction of the number of analyses. The frequency of physicochemical control is much more respected compared to the bacteriological and limnologic controls. Therefore, it is recommended to have laboratory equipment with high technical instrument, and highly trained work force; the regular supply of reagents used in analyses of quality control; the revision of method, mode of analyses of control, monitoring and distribution...|$|E
40|$|Most {{tax evasion}} models {{are set in}} a {{timeless}} environment, though this is not suitable {{for a study of}} revenues from financial activities where tax evasion occurs in a dynamic environment. This study examines a representative agent aiming to maximize the expected utility from inter-temporal consumption and could invest in both riskless and risky assets, through tax evasion is possible only in the latter case. The investor must pay a fine when his/her evasion is detected (with a given probability). We show that: (i) optimal consumption is higher with tax evasion, (ii) optimal evasion is affected by neither the return nor the volatility of the risky asset, (iii) evasion reduces investment in the risky asset and increases investment in the riskless asset, (iv) evasion can be reduced more efficiently by increasing the fine rather than by increasing the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls,</b> (v) for a sufficiently high tax rate on the riskless asset, the optimal evasion is zero, and (vi) if the fine is proportional to the amount of taxes, for only ‘sufficiently’ low fines the Yitzhaki (1974) paradox is confirme...|$|E
40|$|Head {{and neck}} tumors {{represent}} very interesting targets for IMRT techniques {{because of the}} complex shape of the structures and the organs at risk close by. The use {{of this kind of}} techniques requires a quality assurance protocol. The physicists of the GORTEC group shared their experience to define some recommendations in order to draw up a QA protocol. The dosimetric verification of the treatment plans (in terms of absolute and relative dose), the control of the reproducibility of the patient positioning and the use of a record and verify system to control the different parameters form the main parts of these recommendations. Each chapter comprises a description of the different methods, recommendations concerning the equipment, the adopted tolerances, the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls.</b> At the end of each chapter, a table summarizes the main actions to carry out. These recommendations will allow to harmonize our practices whatever the softwares and the accelerator that are being used.

40|$|Schizophrenia is but {{one form}} of psychosis; therefore, it is impor-tant to control for the {{psychotic}} factor in studies of the schizo-phrenic syndrome. A survey was done of 478 articles in 15 major psychiatric and psychological journals to determine the frequen-cy of controls for psychosis in schizophrenia research. The sur-vey covered 10 years from 1970 to 1979. Controls for psychosis were found in 11 percent of the articles surveyed. Nonpsychotic psychiat-ric controls appeared with a fre-quency of 38 percent. Nonpsychi-atric controls (mostly normals) appeared with a frequency of 73 percent. A slight trend was ob-served for a gradual increase in the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls</b> for psy-chosis {{over the last several}} years of the decade. Much of this in-crease was attributable to the in-novative use of nonpsychotic schizophrenics as a control for psychosis and severity of patholo-gy.

40|$|Beer {{was chosen}} as a cereal-derived and {{homogeneous}} product for a comparison of organic and conventional production methods in terms of mycotoxin contamination levels. Ochratoxin A (OTA, a storage mycotoxin) and deoxynivalenol (DON, a field mycotoxin) were assessed by HPLC in organically and conventionally produced beers sold in Belgium. Immunoaffinity column (OchraTest and DONPrep) purification was used prior to HPLC analysis. For in-house validation, recovery experiments, carried out with the spiked beers in the ranges of 50 - 200 ng OTA l- 1 and 20 - 100 microg DON l- 1, led to the overall averages of 91 % (RSD = 10 %, n = 9) and 93 % (RSD = 5 %, n = 27), respectively. Organic beers collected during 2003 - 2004 were more frequently OTA-contaminated (95 %, n = 40) than their conventional counterparts (50 %, n = 40). Conventional beers were OTA-contaminated at a mean concentration of 25 ng l- 1 (range: 19 - 198 ng l- 1), while organic beers contained a mean level of 182 ng l- 1 (range: 18 - 1134 ng l- 1). High OTA contamination above the limit of 200 ng l- 1 (up to 1134 ng l- 1) occasionally occurred in organically produced beers. A complementary survey performed with the same brands in 2005 did not confirm this accidental presence of excessive OTA loads (range: 3 - 67 ng l- 1 for 10 conventional beers and 19 - 158 ng l- 1 for 10 organic beers).

The overall incidence of DON was 67 and 80 % in conventional and organic beers, respectively.

Thus, DON in beers does not appear to be a major matter of concern.
