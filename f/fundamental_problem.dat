5|$|In 1895, Lorentz more {{generally}} explained Fresnel's coefficient {{based on the}} concept of local time. However, Lorentz's theory had the same <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> as Fresnel's: a stationary aether contradicted the Michelson–Morley experiment. So in 1892 Lorentz proposed that moving bodies contract in the direction of motion (FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis, since George FitzGerald had already arrived in 1889 at this conclusion). The equations that he used to describe these effects were further developed by him until 1904. These are now called the Lorentz transformations in his honor, and are identical in form to the equations that Einstein was later to derive from first principles. Unlike Einstein's equations, however, Lorentz's transformations were strictly ad hoc, their only justification being that they seemed to work.|$|E
5|$|Research {{focused on}} four {{individual}} days that accumulated more than 5.9 inches (15cm) of hail in 30 {{minutes on the}} Colorado front range has shown that these events share similar patterns in observed synoptic weather, radar, and lightning characteristics, suggesting the possibility of predicting these events prior to their occurrence. A <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> in continuing {{research in this area}} is that, unlike hail diameter, hail depth is not commonly reported. The lack of data leaves researchers and forecasters in the dark when trying to verify operational methods. A cooperative effort between the University of Colorado and the National Weather Service is in progress. The joint project's goal is to enlist the help of the general public to develop a database of hail accumulation depths.|$|E

The <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> facing historians is establishing the aims of the two accounts and linking up the information in them.|$|E

25|$|Knots can be {{described}} in various ways. Given a method of description, however, there may be more than one description that represents the same knot. For example, a common method of describing a knot is a planar diagram called a knot diagram. Any given knot can be drawn in many different ways using a knot diagram. Therefore, a <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> in knot theory is determining when two descriptions represent the same knot.|$|E
25|$|The <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> {{with the}} quality of American {{medicine}} is that we’ve failed to view delivery of health care as a science. The tasks of medical science fall into three buckets. One is understanding disease biology. One is finding effective therapies. And one is ensuring those therapies are delivered effectively. That third bucket has been almost totally ignored by research funders, government, and academia. It’s viewed as the art of medicine. That’s a mistake, a huge mistake. And from a taxpayer’s perspective it’s outrageous.|$|E
25|$|The {{inclusive}} fitness theory {{provides a}} good overview of possible solutions to the <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> of cooperation: its contradiction to natural selection. The theory {{is based on the}} hypothesis that cooperation helps in transmitting underlying genes to future generations either through increasing the reproductive successes of the individual (direct fitness) or of other individuals who carry the same genes (indirect fitness). Direct benefits can result from simple by-product of cooperation or enforcement mechanisms, while indirect benefits can result from cooperation with genetically similar individuals.|$|E

25|$|A <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> in {{the design}} of {{decompression}} tables is that the simplified rules that govern a single dive and ascent do not apply when some tissue bubbles already exist, as these will delay inert gas elimination and equivalent decompression may result in decompression sickness. Repetitive diving, multiple ascents within a single dive, and surface decompression procedures are significant risk factors for DCS. These have been attributed {{to the development of a}} relatively high gas phase volume which may be partly carried over to subsequent dives or the final ascent of a sawtooth profile.|$|E
25|$|Recognizing {{activities}} for multiple users using on-body sensors {{first appeared in}} the work by ORL using active badge systems in the early 90's. Other sensor technology such as acceleration sensors were used for identifying group activity patterns during office scenarios. Activities of Multiple Users in intelligent environments are addressed in Gu et al. In this work, they investigate the <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> of recognizing {{activities for}} multiple users from sensor readings in a home environment, and propose a novel pattern mining approach to recognize both single-user and multi-user activities in a unified solution.|$|E
25|$|In 1900 Lorentz {{tried to}} explain gravity {{on the basis of}} the Maxwell equations. He first {{considered}} a Le Sage type model and argued that there possibly exists a universal radiation field, consisting of very penetrating em-radiation, and exerting a uniform pressure on every body. Lorentz showed that an attractive force between charged particles would indeed arise, if it is assumed that the incident energy is entirely absorbed. This was the same <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> which had afflicted the other Le Sage models, because the radiation must vanish somehow and any absorption must lead to an enormous heating. Therefore, Lorentz abandoned this model.|$|E

25|$|A <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> in Wi-Fi-based {{activity}} {{recognition is}} {{to estimate the}} user locations. Two important issues are how to reduce the human labelling effort and {{how to cope with}} the changing signal profiles when the environment changes. Yin et al. dealt with the second issue by transferring the labelled knowledge between time periods. Chai and Yang proposed a hidden Markov model-based method to extend labelled knowledge by leveraging the unlabelled user traces. J. Pan et al. propose to perform location estimation through online co-localization, and S. Pan et al. proposed to apply multi-view learning for migrating the labelled data to a new time period.|$|E
25|$|The {{theories}} and principles in the Drake equation {{are closely related}} to the Fermi paradox. The equation was formulated by Frank Drake in 1961 in an attempt to find a systematic means to evaluate the numerous probabilities involved in the existence of alien life. The speculative equation considers the rate of star formation in the galaxy; the fraction of stars with planets and the number per star that are habitable; the fraction of those planets that develop life; the fraction that develop intelligent life; the fraction that have detectable, technological intelligent life; and finally the length of time such communicable civilizations are detectable. The <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> is that the last four terms are completely unknown, rendering statistical estimates impossible.|$|E
25|$|Inclusions of {{different}} sorts mixed with soil {{have been used}} for thousands of years. They were used in roadway construction in Roman days to stabilize roadways and their edges. These early attempts were made of natural fibres, fabrics or vegetation mixed with soil to improve road quality, particularly when roads were built on unstable soil. They were also used to build steep slopes as with several pyramids in Egypt and walls as well. A <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> with using natural materials (wood, cotton, etc.) in a buried environment is the biodegradation that occurs from microorganisms in the soil. With the advent of polymers {{in the middle of the}} 20th century a much more stable material became available. When properly formulated, lifetimes of centuries can be predicted even for harsh environmental conditions.|$|E

25|$|Gluck {{had long}} pondered the <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> {{of form and}} content in opera. He thought both of the main Italian operatic genres – opera buffa and opera seria – had strayed too far from what opera should really be and seemed unnatural. Opera buffa had long lost its {{original}} freshness. Its jokes were threadbare and the repetition of the same characters made them seem no more than stereotypes. In opera seria the singing was devoted to superficial effects and the content was uninteresting and fossilised. As in opera buffa, the singers were effectively absolute masters of the stage and the music, decorating the vocal lines so floridly that audiences could no longer recognise the original melody. Gluck wanted to return opera to its origins, focusing on human drama and passions and making words and music of equal importance.|$|E
25|$|Decisions can be complex {{admixtures}} {{of facts}} and values. Information about facts, especially empirically-proven facts or facts derived from specialized experience, are more easily transmitted {{in the exercise of}} authority than are the expressions of values. Simon is primarily interested in seeking identification of the individual employee with the organizational goals and values. Following Lasswell, he states that “a person identifies himself with a group when, in making a decision, he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the specified group”. A person may identify himself with any number of social, geographic, economic, racial, religious, familial, educational, gender, political, and sports groups. Indeed, the number and variety are unlimited. The <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> for organizations is to recognize that personal and group identifications may either facilitate or obstruct correct decision making for the organization. A specific organization has to determine deliberately, and specify in appropriate detail and clear language, its own goals, objectives, means, ends, and values.|$|E
25|$|While the JIFF policy {{worked on}} one level—the {{number of foreign}} players {{recruited}} into the Top 14 went from 61 for 2011–12 to 34 for 2014–15—clubs quickly found a way around the rules. Many clubs dispatched scouts to identify top teenage prospects in other countries, and then enrolled them in their academies to start the JIFF qualification process. For example, the 59 players in the 2015–16 Clermont youth squad included 17 from nine countries outside of France. A more <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> was identified in 2015 by Laurent Labit, at the time backs coach of the club now known as Racing 92. In an interview with British rugby journalist Gavin Mortimer, Labit pointed out that France has no organized team sport in its educational system at the primary level—children must join an outside club in order to play sports. Only at age 15 do youths {{have the opportunity to}} attend special sporting schools, but places in such institutions are limited. In turn, this means that young French players are technically well behind their counterparts in many other countries, most notably those of the Commonwealth.|$|E
