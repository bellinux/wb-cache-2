5|$|Fishing is the {{principal}} industry in Sisimiut, with harvested stocks of shrimps, salmon, halibut and cod. The Royal Greenland <b>fish</b> <b>processing</b> <b>plant</b> at the port is the largest within Greenland and is amongst the most modern shrimp-shelling factories in the world. In 2008, supplied by 8 boats and the factory trawlers, the plant processed an annual amount of 20,180 tons of shrimp, around 1,680 tons per month. This was roughly constant throughout the year, although when fish catches were larger the fish was frozen. The plant eventually sold around 6,019 tonnes of shrimp. Hunting {{is also important to}} some of the local livelihoods, mainly seals, walrus, beluga whale, narwhale, reindeer and muskoxen.|$|E

2500|$|Many gangsters {{including}} Al Capone and Bill McCoy set up {{operations in}} the islands, using them as a base to smuggle alcohol into the US. Fishermen and armateurs gave up their regular jobs to unload alcohol from Canada, Europe and Bermuda and store it in warehouses. A new <b>fish</b> <b>processing</b> <b>plant</b> was converted into a warehouse. Additionally, distilleries were {{set up on the}} islands. This economic boom lasted until the end of Prohibition in 1933, and was known locally as [...] "Les Temps de la Fraude".

2500|$|Animal fats are a {{by-product}} of meat production and cooking. Although {{it would not be}} efficient to raise animals (or catch fish) simply for their fat, use of the by-product adds value to the livestock industry (hogs, cattle, poultry). Today, multi-feedstock biodiesel facilities are producing high quality animal-fat based biodiesel. Currently, a 5-million dollar plant is being built in the USA, with the intent of producing 11.4million litres (3million gallons) biodiesel from some of the estimated 1billion kg (2.2billion pounds) of chicken fat produced annually at the local Tyson poultry plant. Similarly, some small-scale biodiesel factories use waste fish oil as feedstock. [...] An EU-funded project (ENERFISH) suggests that at a Vietnamese plant to produce biodiesel from catfish (basa, also known as pangasius), an output of 13 tons/day of biodiesel can be produced from 81 tons of fish waste (in turn resulting from 130 tons of fish). This project utilises the biodiesel to fuel a CHP unit in the <b>fish</b> <b>processing</b> <b>plant,</b> mainly to power the fish freezing plant.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial {{fishing is}} the main {{industry}} in Cordova. Half of all households in Cordova {{have at least one}} person involved in commercial fishing or processing. The fishing fleet mainly fishes the Prince William Sound and Copper River Delta area. There are various fisheries in the area, the most economically important of which is the salmon fishery. All Pacific salmon species except for the cherry salmon are caught. Fishermen use either a purse seine, drift gillnet, or set gillnet to catch the fish. All fisheries are regulated by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The fisheries in Alaska have a limited entry permit system. The first <b>fish</b> <b>processing</b> <b>plant</b> near Cordova opened in 1887. In 2009 there were 159 purse seine, 511 drift gilnet, and 27 set gillnet permits fished in the Prince William Sound and Copper River Delta area. Wild fish stocks are augmented by hatcheries where fish are produced and released as fingerlings into rivers. [...] Eventually they migrate to the ocean where they grow to breeding age and then return as adults to be caught by the fishermen or to spawn.|$|E
