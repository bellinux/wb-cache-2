40|$|Summary The {{effects of}} light, {{moderate}} and <b>heavy</b> branch <b>pruning</b> or lopping treatments (resulting in removal of 28 – 31, 56 – 60 and 80 – 82 % of the foliage, respectively, unlopped con-trol = 0 %) were studied in 3 -year-old black alder (Alnus glutinosa L. Gaertn.) plants. Within 24 h of lopping, tran-spiration rates decreased and water potentials increased. The effects of lopping continued for 48 days. The improved water {{status of the}} lopped plants enhanced water-use effi-ciency during the first 30 days. Regrowth was related {{to a combination of}} enhanced net assimilation rates during the first 30 days after lopping, use of current photoassimilates and stored carbohydrates in the roots (particularly in me-dium and heavily lopped plants) for the production of new leaf area, and delayed leaf senescence. The lightly and mod-erately lopped plants developed 62 and 57 % more leaf area, respectively, than the unlopped plants, but total leaf area de-velopment was slower in the heavily lopped plants. Lightly lopped plants produced total biomass equivalent to that of unlopped plants, but the moderately and heavily lopped plants produced less biomass than the unlopped plants. Dur-ing the first 30 days after lopping, there was a net loss of nodule dry matter and recovery to control values did not oc-cur during the period of study. Immediately (24 h) after lop-ping, more 14 C-photosynthate was translocated to the roots of lopped plants than to the roots of unlopped plants.

40|$|Skin-pitting of kiwifruit is a post-harvest disease {{caused by}} Cadophora luteo-olivacea. Inoculation {{occurs in the}} field but {{symptoms}} appear after about three months of cold storage. Incidence of the pathology is very variable over time {{but it can be}} quite high causing considerable damage. The aim {{of this study was to}} search for biological and agronomical control measures, which can reduce skin-pitting. For biological control, isolates of potential antagonists were made from the surface of stored kiwifruit sourced from fruit produced in two different orchards: one with high and the other with low incidence of disease. Five and nine different microorganisms were obtained from fruit of the first and second orchard, respectively. Isolated microorganisms were inoculated on PDA plates together with C. luteo-olivacea. The majority of the isolates did not influence pathogen growth, except for two strains very closely related to Pseudomonas libanensis (P. fluorescens subgroup), isolated from fruit from the orchard with low incidence of symptoms. The bacteria were tested in vitro against five isolates of each of the two most frequent strains of C. luteo-olivacea (A and B); all were significantly inhibited in growth, presenting a compact, mucous and orange-brown mycelium. The strong antagonistic activity of the two P. libanensis strains represented a promising result for further studies. For agronomical control, it is known that light has a positive effect on calcium accumulation in fruits and that a low calcium content contributes towards creating favourable conditions for pathogen development.

40|$|Graphical models {{provide an}} {{attractive}} framework for modeling {{a variety of}} problems in computer vision. The advent of powerful inference techniques such as belief propagation (BP) has recently made inference with many of these models tractable. Even so, the enormous size of the state spaces required for some applications can create a <b>heavy</b> computational burden. <b>Pruning</b> is a standard technique for reducing this burden, but since pruning is irreversible it carries the risk of greedily deleting important states, which can subsequently result in gross errors in BP. To address this problem, we propose a novel extension of pruning, which we call dynamic quantization (DQ), that allows BP to adaptively add as well as subtract states as needed. We examine DQ {{in the context of}} graphical-model based deformable template matching, in which the state space size is on the order of the number of pixels in an image. The combination of BP and DQ yields deformable templates that are both fast and robust to significant occlusions, without requiring any user initialization.

40|$|Pruning of trees, {{in which}} some {{branches}} are removed from the lower crown of a tree, has been extensively used in China in silvicultural management for many purposes. With an experimental and modelling approach, the effects of pruning on tree growth and on the harvest of plant material were studied. In Chapter 2 the aboveground biomass production and harvest of plant material of five subtropical Chinese tree species as affected by annual pruning were analysed. The biomass production of trees decreased following pruning, and the reduction in biomass production was correlated with pruning intensity. The results indicated that, for the investigated five subtropical tree species, the annual pruning regime could not provide enough time for a tree to fully recover its growth, which consequently prevented the sustainable gain of high harvests of plant materials. In Chapter 3, the aboveground biomass allocation and leaf dynamics of four tree species following pruning were investigated. Pruned trees allocated proportionally more of their aboveground biomass to leaves and less to wood, irrespective of species and pruning seasons. This allocation pattern {{was positively correlated with}} pruning intensity. The increased proportional allocation of aboveground biomass to leaves following pruning would benefit pruned trees to alleviate the negative pruning effects and recover from the pruning damage. Chapter 4 focuses on the leaf emergence and shoot production of trees after pruning. Pruning had no effect on the leaf density and shoot production. Pruning facilitated the shoot production on the bare stem parts beneath the remaining crown. In Chapter 5 the leaf efficiency of two Ficus tree species as affected by pruning is reported. The leaf efficiency of both species was increased after pruning. In Chapters 6, a tree growth model was constructed. In Chapter 7, this tree model was applied to simulate the effects of pruning on branch harvest, taking pruning intensity, pruning season, pruning frequency, and tree size at which pruning starts into consideration. To sum up, the effects of pruning on tree growth depended on many factors including pruning season, pruning intensity, pruning interval, tree species, and tree size. <b>Heavy</b> and repeated <b>pruning</b> with short intervals reduced tree growth always. This negative effect, however, can be mitigated to some extent by the increased biomass partitioning to leaves and the increased leaf productivity in the pruned tree...|$|R

40|$|Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) is an {{important}} cash crop in the coastal areas of Papua New Guinea (PNG). In 2000, a mutant cocoa genotype MJ 12 - 226, with abnormal growth characteristics was identified at the Cocoa and Coconut Institute of PNG. The mutant, found among progenies of the cross Scavina 12 x Nanay 149, was characterized by dwarfing, small and narrow leaves, a small root system and strong branching habit. This {{study was designed to}} improve the understanding of the dwarf cocoa mutant and identify its relevance to future cocoa farming. The specific objectives are to investigate the feasibility of using a dwarf mutant of cocoa as a commercial rootstock for various hybrid cocoa clones, to study the genetics of this dwarf mutant and the role of plant hormones in differentiating this mutant from the normal phenotype. This study was carried out at the Cocoa and Coconut Institute of PNG, Rabaul, Papua New Guinea, and at the University of Queensland, Gatton Campus, Australia. The comparative study of mutant and normal cocoa seedlings revealed distinct vegetative differences between the two genotypes at the nursery stage. The largest effects of the mutant genotype are on stem elongation, short internodes, multiple stems, root growth and leaf growth. The agronomic results indicated that the mutant rootstock significantly reduced tree vigour at least in the early years. When used as a rootstock, the mutant had a significant dwarfing effect on scion growth of cocoa clones in the nursery and persisted in the field 12 months after planting. After that, the cocoa clones grafted on mutant rootstock reverted to normal growth. It was postulated that the accumulation of endogenous growth substances and cambial activity between the scion (normal) and the rootstock overcame the dwarfing effect of the mutant genotype. Yield and vegetative data collection from this trial ceased on May 2006 and recommenced in May 2007 to allow trees to recover from <b>heavy</b> canopy <b>pruning</b> due to cocoa pod borer attack. This resulted in one year loss of yield and vegetative data from this experiment. The first two years’ yield data indicated no significant differences between mutant, normal segregants and commercial rootstocks. However, cocoa clones bud grafted on these mutant rootstocks produced significantly greater yield at higher planting density compared with lower densities and this was sustained for two years. However, it might be expected that competition among cocoa trees would increase with increased size of trees, favouring low density planting and reducing the differential performance of the trees under high density planting with time. The major advantages of reducing tree vigour are to improve the harvest index, ease of harvesting, pruning and overall management of the trees. The continuation of this study to collect mature tree yield data (from fifth to eighth years) would confirm these results. This work has also demonstrated {{for the first time that}} cocoa clones grafted on mutant rootstock can produce similar yields to clones grafted on normal or commercial rootstocks. Moreover, this study has also established that cocoa clones derived from orthotropic scions can yield the same as plagiotropic scions when grafted on to either mutant or normal rootstocks. Therefore, it is proposed that mutant rootstocks and orthtropic scions should also be considered for future use in cocoa farming. The strong branching habit and dwarfing stature of the mutant suggested that the mutation affects the quantity or the balance of plant growth hormones, or both. The effect of exogenously applied gibberellic acid (GA 3) on developmental processes in dwarf mutant and normal cocoa seedlings was studied. Both dwarf mutant and normal one month old cocoa seedlings responded to gibberellic acid (GA 3) by accelerated longitudinal growth, especially seedling height. Paclobutrazol (PBZ) applied to normal cocoa seedlings altered the growth so that they almost resembled the mutant phenotype. It was postulated that PBZ prevented GA biosynthesis in the normal cocoa seedlings and therefore decreased bioactive auxin (IAA) which, in turn, then promoted lateral shoot growth; PBZ also slightly retarded plant growth. Synthetic auxin (IBA/NAA) significantly inhibited lateral bud sprouting and growth of intact, decapitated and nodal segments of mutant and normal cocoa seedlings compared with control and those treated with IAA. It appears that the mutant and normal cocoa genotypes have a similar capacity to metabolize IAA and this capacity was much greater than for synthetic auxins. The results suggested that auxin levels in the mutant seedlings were probably limiting, and therefore affected biosynthesis of gibberellic acid thus resulting in the dwarfing characteristics of the mutant cocoa genotype. However, analysis of endogenous IAA and GA 1 levels at four months old did not reveal differences between the mutant and normal seedlings. The present genetic studies which included backcrossing, test crossing and selfing of F 1 progenies confirmed earlier work on the mutant and showed that the mutant was probably heterozygous (Dd). The allele (DD) in mutant cocoa is probably lethal in nature because the phenotype of the homozygote was not observed amongst the mutant progenies. Mutant segregants were obtained in a 1 : 1 ratio only when the mutant clone was used as the female; however, when the mutant was used as male, very few mutant segregants were obtained. This suggested selective pollen viability (pollen grains carrying the D allele are nonviable) or an incompatible reaction between pollen tubes (D carrying pollen) and style or ovule. The selfing and test-crosses of F 1 progenies resulted in deviation from the expected 3 : 1 segregation ratio to a 1 : 1 ratio...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{evaluate}} the effects of two soil management systems, so called ‘sustainable’ (ST) and ‘conventional’ (CT) on the composition, genetic diversity and carbon substrate utilization of soil microbial communities in a Mediterranean olive orchard. ST system included no-tillage, limited chemical fertilization, and organic matter inputs from drip irrigation with wastewater, spontaneous cover crops and pruning material. CT system was characterized by soil tillage, chemical fertilization, no irrigation and <b>heavy</b> <b>pruning.</b> After seven years of treatments, average olive yield was 8. 4 and 3. 1 t ha– 1 yr– 1 in ST and CT, respectively. CT had a significant higher number of total bacteria and actinomycetes if compared to ST, whereas fungi were significantly lower. In ST, {{the number of the}} bacteria involved in the nitrogen cycle isolated from the wetted areas under the drippers (ST-WET) were significantly higher than in inter-row areas (ST-INTER). The patterns of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of microbial 16 S/ 18 S rDNA showed differences between ST and CT, whereas those of 16 S/ 18 S rRNA evidenced that ST-WET clustered separately from CT and ST-INTER. Diversity indexes evaluated by Biolog® assay were significantly different between ST and CT. The results revealed qualitative and quantitative changes of soil microbial communities in response to sustainable agricultural practices that stimulate soil micro-organisms and improve olive yield and quality...|$|E
