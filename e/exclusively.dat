Childhood gender nonconformity appeared more significant for <b>exclusively</b> homosexual women than for bisexual women, and more significant for women who had been in psychotherapy than for women who had not.|$|E

5|$|Based on Kinsey's scale where 0 {{represents}} {{a person with}} an <b>exclusively</b> heterosexual response and 6 {{represents a}} person with an <b>exclusively</b> homosexual one, and numbers in between represent a gradient of responses with both sexes, 6% of those interviewed ranked as a 6: <b>exclusively</b> homosexual. Apart from those who ranked 0 (71%), the largest percentage in between 0 and 6 was 1 at approximately 15%. However, the Kinsey Report remarked that the ranking described a period in a person's life, and that a person's orientation may change. Among the criticisms the Kinsey Report received, a particular one addressed the Institute for Sex Research's tendency to use statistical sampling, which facilitated an over-representation of same-sex relationships by other researchers who did not adhere to Kinsey's qualifications of data.|$|E
