40|$|The {{performance}} of artificially milked young <b>hares,</b> born <b>in</b> <b>captivity</b> or born <b>in</b> pens (three animals each) {{were compared with}} those of normally reared young hares (ten anoimals bearing to the control group). In experimental groups the live weights and the feed consumption were daily measured during suckling then weekly measured. In control group the live weight was measured in 15, 25, 35, 60, 90, 120, 150, 200 and 270 days old hares. Normally reared young hares were weaned at 25 - 28 days old, artificially milked young <b>hares</b> born <b>in</b> cages or in large pens were weaned at 35 - 40 and 80 - 90 days old, respectively. Non linear growth curves were calculated by iteratively re-weighted least squares using the classic logistic model. At fixed age live weights were compared by ANOVA. Results showed that the hare growth was fitted by the following equations: normally reared young hares, LW = 3482 /(1 +exp(1. 627 - 0. 022 * days)) (R 2 = 0. 985); artificially-milked young <b>hares</b> born <b>in</b> <b>captivity,</b> lW = 3401 /(1 +exp(2. 405 - 0. 035 *days)) (R 2 = 0. 995); artificially-milked young <b>hares</b> born <b>in</b> pens, LW = 3985 /(1 +exp(2. 307 - 0. 024 *days)) (R 2 = 0. 999). The disadvantage due to artificial milking was completely regained at 60 - 90 days by artificially milked young <b>hares</b> born <b>in</b> <b>captivity</b> and at 120 days by artificially milked young <b>hares</b> born <b>in</b> large pens. Maximum growth speed was reached at 74, 69, 97 days in the groups...|$|R

50|$|Dolphins and {{porpoises}} {{are kept}} <b>in</b> <b>captivity.</b> Bottlenose dolphins {{are the most}} common, as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan <b>in</b> <b>captivity</b> and have a friendly appearance.

500|$|Aquariums {{have tried}} housing {{other species of}} whales <b>in</b> <b>captivity.</b> The success of belugas turned {{attention}} to maintaining their relative, the narwhal, <b>in</b> <b>captivity.</b> However, <b>in</b> repeated attempts in the 1960s and 1970s, all narwhals kept <b>in</b> <b>captivity</b> died within months. A pair of pygmy right whales were retained in an enclosed area (with nets); they were eventually released in South Africa. There was one attempt to keep a stranded Sowerby's beaked whale calf in captivity; the calf rammed into the tank wall, breaking its rostrum, which resulted in death. It was thought that Sowerby's beaked whale evolved to swim fast in a straight line, and a [...] tank was not big enough. There have been attempts to keep baleen whales <b>in</b> <b>captivity.</b> There were three attempts to keep grey whales <b>in</b> <b>captivity.</b> Gigi was a grey whale calf that died in transport. Gigi II was another grey whale calf that was captured in the Ojo de Liebre Lagoon, and was transported to SeaWorld.

50|$|Elephants <b>in</b> <b>captivity</b> refers {{most often}} to {{elephants}} either born <b>in</b> <b>captivity,</b> {{such as a}} zoo, circus, or camp, or have been imported from the wild.

There are estimated to be 15,000 to 20,000 elephants <b>in</b> <b>captivity,</b> of a total population of 40,000 to 50,000.
