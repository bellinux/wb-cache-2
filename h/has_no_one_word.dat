50|$|Ancient Indian texts {{call the}} {{craftsmen}} and builders of temples as ‘‘Silpin’’ (Sanskrit: शिल्पिन्), derived from ‘‘Silpa’’. One of earliest mentions of Sanskrit word Silpa is in Atharvaveda, from about 1000 BC, which scholars have translated as any work of art. Other scholars {{suggest that the}} <b>word</b> Silpa <b>has</b> <b>no</b> direct <b>one</b> <b>word</b> translation in English, nor does the word ‘‘Silpin’’. Silpa, explains Stella Kramrisch, is a multicolored word and incorporates art, skill, craft, ingenuity, imagination, form, expression and inventiveness of any art or craft. Similarly a Shilpin, notes Kramrisch, is a complex Sanskrit word, describing any person who embodies art, science, culture, skill, rhythm and employs creative principles to produce any divine form of expression. Silpins who built Hindu temples, {{as well as the}} art works and sculpture within them, were considered by the ancient Sanskrit texts to deploy arts whose number are unlimited, Kala (techniques) that were 64 in number, and Vidya (science) that were of 32 types.|$|R

50|$|Rivals such as Apple, Tandy, and Commodore—together {{with more}} than 50% of the personal-computer market—had many advantages. While IBM began with one microcomputer, little {{available}} hardware or software, {{and a couple of}} hundred dealers, Radio Shack had 14 million customers and 8,000 stores—more than McDonald's—that only sold its broad range of computers and accessories. Apple had five times as many dealers in the US as IBM, an established international distribution network, and an installed base of more than 250,000 customers. Hundreds of independent developers produced software and peripherals for both companies' computers; at least ten Apple databases and ten word processors were available, while the PC <b>had</b> <b>no</b> databases and <b>one</b> <b>word</b> processor.

6000|$|But {{those who}} were trying earnestly to do their work, though amid many {{mistakes}} and failures, why should they dread {{the coming of the}} kingdom of God? Why should they shrink from remembering that, though God's kingdom is not come in perfection and fulness, it is here already, and they are in it? Why should they shrink from that thought? They will find it full of comfort, of strength, and hope, if they will but hallow their Father's name, and remember the fact of all facts--that they have a Father in heaven. There are thousands on earth, from the highest to the lowest, who can say honestly--to take the commonest instance--every parent can say it--"I have a heavy work to do, a heavy responsibility to fulfil. [...] God knows I did not seek it, thrust myself into it; it was thrust upon me. It came to me in the course of nature or of society, and circumstances over which I <b>had</b> <b>no</b> control. In <b>one</b> <b>word</b> it was MY DUTY. [...] But now that I have my duty to do, behold I cannot do it. I try my best, but I fail. I come short daily of my own low standard of duty. How much more of God's perfect standard of it! And the burden of responsibility, the regret for failure, is more than I can bear.|$|R
