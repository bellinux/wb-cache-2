METHODS: The expression of <b>eotaxins</b> and eosinophil counts were determined in bronchial biopsy specimens obtained from 10 subjects with mild asthma 48 hours after diluent and allergen challenge by using immunohistochemistry.

In contrast, PBS-processed sputum resulted in an <b>eotaxin</b> spike recovery of 101 % (SD, 20 %). Addition of protease inhibitors or high-speed centrifugation had no effect on <b>eotaxin</b> detection. By using this optimized protocol, <b>eotaxin</b> levels in PBS-processed sputum samples were found to be significantly increased in asthmatic sputum (P<. 05). Conclusion Measurement of <b>eotaxin</b> by means of immunoassay is adversely affected by DTE, possibly through irreversible denaturation of epitopes, which makes <b>eotaxin</b> undetectable by using the immunoassay antibody. Sputum samples should be processed into PBS for assessment of <b>eotaxin,</b> which is present at increased levels in asthmatic sputum. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Eosinophils are {{effector}} cells that migrate toward several mediators released at inflammatory sites {{to perform their}} multiple functions. The mechanisms driving eosinophil selective accumulation in sites of allergic inflammation are well established and involve several steps controlled by adhesion molecules, priming agents, chemotactic and surviving factors. Even though the majority of studies focused on role of protein mediators like IL- 5 and <b>eotaxins,</b> lipid mediators also participate in eosinophil recruitment and activation. Among the lipid mediators with distinguish eosinophil recruitment and activation capabilities are platelet activating factor (PAF) and the eicosanoids, including leukotriene B 4, cysteinyl leukotrienes and prostaglandin D 2. In this review, we focused {{on the role of}} these four lipid mediators in eosinophil recruitment and activation, since they are recognized as key mediators of eosinophilic inflammatory responses...|$|R

Here, we show that serum IL- 5 is maintained by long-lived type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC 2) resident in peripheral tissues.

40|$|Tobacco smoking among {{asthmatic}} individuals {{has shown}} {{to influence the}} course and severity {{of the disease and}} its response to treatment. 1 - 5 Specifically, smoking may stimulate the production of <b>eotaxins</b> (potent eosinophil chemoattractant cytokines involved in the inflammatory response in asthma), 3, 5 accelerate the decline in pulmonary function (FEV(1) /FVC is lower in smokers than nonsmokers with asthma), 4, 6 reduce the effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids by modifying their pharmacological properties, 1, 4, 7 and increase the long-term mortality risk following a near-fatal asthma attack. 3, 8 Moreover, the finding that children who smoke regularly are four times more likely to develop asthma within 8 years of follow than nonsmokers, suggests a causal link between smoking and asthma. 9 Data from the 2007 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) was analyzed to estimate the prevalence of any cigarette smoking in the past 30 days (i. e., current tobacco smoking) in a nationally representative sample of American adolescent students who had been told by a doctor or nurse that they have asthma (n= 1, 438).

40|$|The β {{chemokine}} <b>eotaxin</b> is {{a potent}} eosinophil activator and chemoattractant. We examined immunohistochemically <b>eotaxin</b> protein expression {{in a range of}} normal rat tissues and in rat lung during Sephadex particle-induced pulmonary inflammation. The time course of <b>eotaxin</b> expression in lung at various time points after Sephadex administration was related to the appearance of eosinophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and tissue distribution of <b>eotaxin</b> receptor (CCR 3) positive cells. Results showed that <b>eotaxin</b> protein was constitutively expressed by both lung airway epithelial cells and gut epithelial cells in normal tissues in the absence of inflammation. During Sephadex induced pulmonary inflammation, <b>eotaxin</b> expression increased in alveolar macrophages prior to the major increase in eosinophil numbers which reached a peak at 72 h. The pattern of <b>eotaxin</b> pulmonary expression and the location of CCR 3 receptor positive cells suggest a chemoattractant gradient resulting in migration firstly into the tissue and subsequently through the airway epithelium into the airways. Treatment of rats with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone or the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A reduced eosinophil entry into lung tissue and airways but had no apparent effect on <b>eotaxin</b> expression in vivo, indicating that both these drugs inhibit eosinophil recruitment either by an eotaxin-independent mechanism, or by targetting factors that synergise with <b>eotaxin,</b> or an event post <b>eotaxin</b> expression...|$|E
40|$|The CC {{chemokine}} <b>eotaxin,</b> {{identified in}} guinea pigs and also recently in mice, {{may be a}} key element for the selective recruitment of eosinophils to certain inflamed tissues. Using a partial mouse <b>eotaxin</b> CDNA probe, the human <b>eotaxin</b> gene was cloned and found to be 61. 8 and 63. 2 % identical at the amino acid level to guinea pig and mouse <b>eotaxin.</b> Human <b>eotaxin</b> protein was a strong and specific eosinophil chemoattractant in vitro and was an effective eosinophil chemoattractant when injected into {{the skin of a}} rhesus monkey. Radiolabeled <b>eotaxin</b> was used to identify a high affinity receptor on eosinophils (0. 52 nM Kd), expressed at 4. 8 x 10 (4) sites per cell. This receptor also bound RANTES and monocyte chemotactic protein- 3 with lower affinity, but not macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 alpha. <b>Eotaxin</b> could desensitize calcium responses of eosinophils to RANTES and monocyte chemotactic protein- 3, although RANTES was able to only partially desensitize eosinophil calcium responses to <b>eotaxin.</b> Immunohistochemistry on human nasal polyp with antieotaxin mAbs showed that certain leukocytes as well as respiratory epithelium were intensely immunoreactive, and eosinophil infiltration occurred at sites of <b>eotaxin</b> upregulation. Thus <b>eotaxin</b> in humans is a potent and selective eosinophil chemoattractant that is expressed by a variety cell types in certain inflammatory conditions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Eotaxin</b> is an {{important}} inflammatory chemokine in eosinophil chemotaxis and activation and, thus, is implicated in asthma. Recently, obesity was {{associated with an increased}} prevalence of asthma, but the relationship between obesity and <b>eotaxin</b> expression has only been partially understood in obese mice and human studies. Therefore, we studied the expression patterns of <b>eotaxin</b> in 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes/adipocytes to determine whether <b>eotaxin</b> levels are influenced by body weight gain and/or reduction in diet-induced obese mice. First, we investigated <b>eotaxin</b> expression during differentiation in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Then, we treated 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes/adipocytes with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), <b>eotaxin,</b> interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 5, or leptin. To examine the effects of weight loss in high-fat diet induced obese mice, we fed C 57 BL/ 6 mice a high-fat diet or a normal diet for 26 weeks. Then, half of the high-fat diet group were fed a normal diet until 30 weeks to reduce weight. Epididymal adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue, serum, and bronchoalveolar fluid of mice were examined for <b>eotaxin</b> expression. The results showed that <b>eotaxin</b> expression levels increased with adipocyte differentiation and that more <b>eotaxin</b> was expressed when the cells were stimulated with TNF-α, <b>eotaxin,</b> IL- 4, IL- 5, or leptin. An in vivo study showed that <b>eotaxin</b> levels were reduced in visceral adipose tissues when high-fat diet fed mice underwent weight loss. Taken together, these results indicate a close relationship between <b>eotaxin</b> expression and obesity as well as weight loss, thus, they indirectly show a relation to asthma...|$|E
40|$|Asthma is an {{inflammatory}} disease usually characterized by increased Type 2 cytokines and by an infiltration of eosinophils to the airways. While {{the production of}} Type 2 cytokines {{has been associated with}} TH 2 lymphocytes, increasing evidence indicates that group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC 2) {{play an important role in}} the production of the Type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL) - 5 and IL- 13, which likely amplifies the recruitment of eosinophils from the blood to the airways. In that regard, recent asthma treatments have been focusing on blocking Type 2 cytokines, notably IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 13. These treatments mainly result in decreased blood or sputum eosinophil counts as well as decreased asthma symptoms. This supports that therapies blocking eosinophil recruitment and activation are valuable tools in the management of asthma and its severity. Herein, we review the mechanisms involved in eosinophil and ILC 2 recruitment to the airways, with an emphasis on <b>eotaxins,</b> other chemokines as well as their receptors. We also discuss the involvement of other chemoattractants, notably the bioactive lipids 5 -oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid, prostaglandin D 2, and 2 -arachidonoyl-glycerol. Given that eosinophil biology differs between human and mice, we also highlight and discuss their responsiveness toward the different eosinophil chemoattractants...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Complicated Plasmodium falciparum {{infection}} {{is associated with}} a 6. 4 % mortality rate in India, yet its prognostication is incompletely understood. The conventional prognostic markers of falciparum malaria include clinical, haematological and biochemical parameters. However these factors are non-specific. Hence there is a need of an accurate inexpensive objective marker for prognosticating falciparum malaria infection outcomes. Angiopoietins, angiogenic factors, <b>eotaxins,</b> adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines have been studied for prognostication of this common disease. Determination of the first four is technically difficult and requires a high level of expertise and equipment. Intermediary cytokines have the most promising role. This study was conducted with the aim to evaluate the serum level of TNF-α in patients with P. falciparum malaria and carry out statistical analysis of levels of serum TNF-α with parasite index, age, severity of anaemia, hypoglycaemia, hepatic and renal dysfunction. In our study the average TNF alpha level in 91 healthy controls was 46. 42 pg/ml whereas that in mild falciparum malaria was 100. 45 pg/ml, in severe malaria – 278. 63 pg/ml and in cerebral malaria it was 532. 6 pg/ml. The mean TNF alpha level was significantly different in severe malaria and cerebral malaria compared to that in healthy controls (p <...|$|R
40|$|Interleukin (IL) - 13 {{transgene}} overexpression in {{the lung}} induces features of chronic inflammatory lung disorders, including an eosinophil-rich inflammatory cell infiltration, airway hyper-reactivity, and remodeling of the airway (eg, subepithelial fibrosis, goblet cell metaplasia, and smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia). Here, we aimed {{to define the}} role of eosinophils and eosinophil signaling molecules [eg, <b>eotaxins</b> and CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 3] in IL- 13 -mediated airway disease. To accomplish this, we mated IL- 13 -inducible lung transgenic mice with mice deficient in eosinophil chemoattractant molecules (eotaxin- 1, eotaxin- 2, and their receptor CCR 3) and with mice genetically deficient in eosinophils (Δdbl-GATA). We report that {{in the absence of}} eotaxin- 2 or CCR 3, there was a profound reduction in IL- 13 -induced eosinophil recruitment into the lung lumen. In contrast, in the absence of eotaxin- 1, there was a fourfold increase in IL- 13 -mediated eosinophil recruitment into the airway. IL- 13 transgenic mice deficient in CCR 3 had a 98 % reduction in lung eosinophils. Furthermore, the reduction in pulmonary eosinophils correlated with attenuation in IL- 13 -induced mucus cell metaplasia and collagen deposition. Mechanistic analysis identified alterations in pulmonary protease and transforming growth factor-β 1 expression in eosinophil-deficient mice. Taken together, these data definitively identify a functional contribution by eosinophils on the effects of chronic IL- 13 expression in the lung...|$|R
