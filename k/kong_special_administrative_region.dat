Describes the planning environment in Hong Kong, characterized as 'administrative authoritarianism' (Chui, 1996) in which an executive-led administration has overwhelming authority over the legislature and therefore considerable power over urban planning; discusses the statutory and administrative mechanisms which give the government supremacy in the planning process; and points out that the extent of civilian participation is extremely limited, leaving the government to interpret and act on the 'public interest'. Offers an appraisal of the socio-economic and political context in which urban planners operate and concludes that as civil society becomes more articulate and more demanding of a role in identifying the public interest, government planners must rethink their own interpretation of the public interest...|$|R
