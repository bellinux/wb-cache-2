5|$|In Europe, Amanita ceciliae is {{widespread}} everywhere, though infrequently encountered. It often inhabits deciduous forests with <b>hornbeam</b> (Carpinus), oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus) and birch (Betula), {{but it can}} also rarely occur with conifers: pine (Pinus), fir (Abies), spruce (Picea) and cedar (Cedrus). It has a preference for neutral to calcareous soils.|$|E
5|$|Mycena fuscoaurantiaca {{is known}} only from Kanagawa, Japan.

Fruit bodies appear in November.|$|E
25|$|Though some botanists grouped {{them with}} the hazels (Corylus) and hop-hornbeams (Ostrya) in a {{segregated}} family, Corylaceae, modern botanists place the <b>hornbeams</b> in the birch subfamily Coryloideae.|$|R
50|$|Beetles in {{this family}} live and breed in wood. This species is {{associated}} with trees such as <b>hornbeams,</b> chestnuts, hazels, beeches, oaks, and species of Populus and Prunus.|$|R

5|$|Marasmius funalis {{is known}} only from Kawasaki, Kanagawa and Machida, Tokyo, Japan. Mushrooms grow in groups on dead plant matter, {{and have been}} {{recorded}} on Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) wood and leaf litter in woodland mostly made up of Chonowski's <b>hornbeam</b> (Carpinus tschonoskii) and bamboo-leaf oak (Quercus myrsinifolia). The mushrooms can be encountered from May to July.|$|E
5|$|Other less {{satisfactory}} materials than horn {{have been}} used for the belly of the bow (the part facing the archer when shooting), including bone, antler, or compression-resistant woods such as osage orange, <b>hornbeam,</b> or yew. Materials that are strong under tension, such as silk, or tough wood, like hickory, {{have been used}} {{on the back of the}} bow (the part facing away from the archer when shooting).|$|E
5|$|Ciomadul {{is covered}} by beech and spruce forests. Around St. Ana lake, the {{vegetation}} is mostly formed by Fagus sylvatica (common beech) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) woods. Other trees include Acer platanoides (Norway maple), Betula pendula (silver birch), Carpinus betulus (common <b>hornbeam),</b> Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine), Salix caprea (goat willow) and Salix cinerea (grey willow). A fen contains Carex lasiocarpa (slender sedge), Carex rostrata (bottle sedge), Lysimachia thyrsiflora (tufted loosestrife) and Sphagnum angustifolium (fine bogmoss).

50|$|The wood is ancient coppice with {{standards}} with mainly {{pedunculate oak}} and <b>hornbeams</b> dominant in the coppice layer. The unimproved meadow is poorly drained and species rich, with grasses including red fescue and Yorkshire fog.|$|R
50|$|This is {{an ancient}} coppice with {{standards}} wood {{with a variety of}} woodland types. There are many <b>hornbeams,</b> and other trees include oak and ash. Wet rides, a pond and a stream provide additional ecological interest.|$|R
50|$|B. porosporus appears {{occasionally}} in the autumn, and grows singly {{or in small}} groups in mixed deciduous woods, particularly with oak, <b>hornbeams,</b> and beech. This species is widespread in northern temperate zones, but somewhat rare in Europe.|$|R
5|$|The {{species is}} common in spruce-fir and spruce-moorland forests and in spruce forests and plantations. Together with spruces, the fungus is also common in {{different}} European beech and oak-European <b>hornbeam</b> forests, {{but also on the}} forest edges, on clearings and in clearcut meadows and even on juniper heathers and in parkland. There are scarcely any habitats where the spruce is common, while the fungus is not found there. The fungus is very common in young spruce forests that are 10 to 20 years old, where it occurs on forest path edges occasionally in masses.|$|E
5|$|The {{purposes}} of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and the pleasant exercise {{of effort and}} ingenuity (for the grower). Bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping {{of one or more}} small trees growing in a container, beginning with a cutting, seedling, or small tree of a species suitable for bonsai development. Bonsai can be created from nearly any perennial woody-stemmed tree or shrub species that produces true branches and can be cultivated to remain small through pot confinement with crown and root pruning. Some species are popular as bonsai material because they have characteristics, such as small leaves or needles, that make them appropriate for the compact visual scope of bonsai and a miniature deciduous forest can even be created using such species as Japanese maple, Japanese zelkova or <b>hornbeam.</b>|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata is an ectomycorrhizal species, {{with a wide}} {{ecological}} range. It can {{be found}} in all biomes from low-lying deciduous woodland to arctic-alpine areas. It typically grows on the ground in deciduous (or mixed) woodland, favouring beech. It grows best on chalky soil, among leaf litter. In North America, it favours sandy soil, clay or moss. It is also encountered on pathsides. As well as beech, the species has been recorded growing in association with <b>hornbeam,</b> hazel, oak and lime. Inocybe maculata f. fulva favours birch, spruce, pine, Populus, willow, (as well as Dryas and Polygonum in alpine regions). Mushrooms grow individually or in scattered groups. Though widespread in the areas it is found, it is not a common species. It can be found from western Europe to eastern Asia; and in North America, from where it was first collected in the 1960s. Inocybe maculata f. fulva was first identified in France, and has since been found elsewhere in Europe.|$|E
50|$|The square {{is lined}} with {{buildings}} of the 19th century and a post office. It is illuminated on the night with violet colours. The vegetation consists mainly of <b>Hornbeams</b> and Paulownias, with suspensions of spring flowering bulbs.|$|R
50|$|A large {{proportion}} of the lowland's forests have been cleared out, although pine forests mixed with firs and birches occur in the region's sandy areas, and fir forests mixed with <b>hornbeams</b> and maples grow in its heavier soils.|$|R
50|$|In the Möslepark up to 200 {{year old}} oak trees, <b>hornbeams</b> and big rhododendrons can be found. Moreover, {{it is an}} {{important}} habitat for bats, such as the noctule. The park is part of the nature preserve Lorettoberg-Günterstal-Littenweiler.|$|R
5|$|Traditionally, the badnjak {{ceremony}} {{begins on}} Christmas Eve, {{but there are}} many regional variations surrounding the details. Early in the morning the head of each family, usually accompanied by several male relatives, selects and fells the tree from which a log will be cut for their household. The group announces its departure by firing guns or small celebratory mortars called prangija. The Turkey oak is the most popular species of tree selected in most regions, but other oaks are also chosen. Beech, pear, quince, <b>hornbeam,</b> and plum trees are used in eastern Serbia, although less frequently than oak trees. In some areas of Montenegrin Littoral where oaks do not grow, olives, bay laurels, elms, or strawberry trees are used instead. Young, straight, and undamaged specimens are preferred. The badnjak may be more valued if it is felled stealthily in someone else's rather than in one's own woods.|$|E
25|$|The lowland regions used to {{be covered}} by swaths of oak, beech, and <b>hornbeam,</b> which have since been cleared.|$|E
25|$|Carpinus betulus L. — European <b>hornbeam</b> - {{widespread}} {{across much}} of Europe; Turkey, Iran, Caucasus; naturalized in a few places in US.|$|E
50|$|The {{slopes of}} the {{mountain}} are covered with broadleaved forests (ash trees, <b>hornbeams,</b> oaks, beeches). Also, there is the Perkalsky Dendrologic Orchard on the northern slope of the mountain, which contains approximately 800 kinds of different woody plants and brushwood.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a wide}} lane that {{joins the}} mansion area with town. The lane {{is located in the}} park of the {{landscape}} type.The park occupies territory of more than 8 square kilometers. Ashes, alders, <b>hornbeams,</b> and oaks prevail in the park.|$|R
50|$|The park {{contains}} valuable trees, mostly local varieties, {{but also}} some foreign trees, especially from North America. In 1993, 770 maples, 455 ash trees, 381 linden, 291 chestnuts and 257 <b>hornbeams</b> were counted, {{with an average age}} of 80 to 150 years at the time.|$|R
25|$|Hornbeams {{are used}} as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} autumnal moth, common emerald, feathered thorn, walnut sphinx, Svensson's copper underwing, and winter moth (recorded on European <b>Hornbeam)</b> {{as well as the}} Coleophora case-bearers C. currucipennella and C. ostryae.|$|E
25|$|The {{hills of}} Považský Inovec are mostly covered with {{deciduous}} forests. These consist of oak and <b>hornbeam</b> {{in the lower}} elevations, and beech in the higher elevations. The Váh valley is used for agriculture. The main products are cereals, sugar beet, animal feed, and pork.|$|E
25|$|The {{vegetation}} is heterogeneous and storeyed due to {{the prevalence}} of hilly and mountainous relief. In Cluj County can be met {{a wide range of}} plant formations. Sub-alpine floor, present in Vlădeasa Massif and Muntele Mare, is characterized by lawns with midget grasses and juniper bushes. The spruce forests floor, expanded on mountain slopes between 1,000–1,600 m, consists predominantly of spruce mixed with fir, and the deciduous forests floor develops on all forms of relief, ranging from 400–1,000 m, and consists of sessile forests mixed with beech, <b>hornbeam</b> or elm. On slopes with northern exposure of Luna and Lujerdiu valleys develop compact clusters of sessile, <b>hornbeam,</b> ash and elm forests. In the Hilly Plain of Transylvania appear islands of steppe, alternating with patches of forests.|$|E
25|$|The {{countryside}} is {{very attractive}} in all shades of green; the higher mountainous area is mainly covered with dense forests of pines, firs, spruces, chestnuts, oaks, <b>hornbeams,</b> rhododendrons, beeches, and alders, while the coastal zone (up to 20–30km inland) is densely planted with hazelnut trees and some tea.|$|R
50|$|A hemiboreal forest {{has some}} {{characteristics}} of a boreal forest, and also shares features with temperate-zone forests to the south. Coniferous trees predominate in the hemiboreal zone, but {{a significant number of}} deciduous species, such as aspens, oaks, maples, ash trees, birches, beeches, hazels, and <b>hornbeams,</b> also occur.|$|R
50|$|In {{the middle}} of the park was a {{circular}} labyrinth of trimmed <b>hornbeams</b> (bot. Carpinus betulus) with a flower bed in its center. From 1907, there were 45 busts of famous Poles displayed in the park, ordered by Jordan and made by sculptors Alfred Daun and Michal Korpal.|$|R
