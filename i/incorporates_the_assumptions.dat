The most recent set of 75 -year projections {{was published in}} June 2012. This publication presents additional information about those projections, which were {{made on the basis}} of two scenarios: The first, CBO’s extended baseline scenario, adheres closely to current law. For example, that scenario reflects the assumption that the cuts in individual income taxes enacted since 2001 and most recently extended in 2010 will expire as scheduled in 2012 and 2013. CBO also has developed an extended alternative fiscal scenario, which <b>incorporates</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumptions</b> that certain policies that have been in place for a number of years will be continued and that some provisions of law that might be difficult to sustain for a long period will be modified. Unless otherwise noted, the projections presented in the current analysis are based on the assumptions of the extended baseline scenario. In that scenario, income taxes, including the income taxes on Social Security benefits that are credited to the trust funds, are higher than they are in the extended alternative fiscal scenario...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop and}} test a model {{describing}} {{the effects of}} motivational resources and autonomy support on math performance. The model, based on Self-Determination Theory (SDT), <b>incorporates</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumptions</b> that intrinsic forms of motivation positively affect math performance, whereas external regulation (another form of motivation) negatively affects math performance. We also assume that math self-concept affects math performance, not only directly but also indirectly through the mediating variable of intrinsic motivation. Finally, we examine the effects on motivation and performance of one specific aspect of teacher behavior, namely autonomy support in the classroom. We hypothesize that autonomy support can affect math performance both directly and indirectly through the mediator of math self-concept. We tested this causal model {{using data from the}} Third International Mathematics and Science Study-Revised or TIMSS-R (1999) on the math performance of eighth-grade students in the USA. The results were consistent with the predictions of SDT. Both structural equation modeling and multilevel path modeling analyses confirmed that intrinsic motivation positively influences math performance, while external regulation negatively influences math performance. Also, a positive math self-concept significantly affects math performance both directly and indirectly through the mediator of intrinsic motivation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes theoretically and empirically {{the role}} of fiscal dominance as defined by Sargent and Wallace (1981) {{in the behavior of}} inflation, the real exchange rate, and the stock of net international reserves in developing countries with imperfect capital mobility and managed exchange rate regimes. We develop an open-economy AD-AS model that imposes the government intertemporal solvency constraint and <b>incorporates</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumptions</b> of a managed exchange rate regime with imperfect capital mobility. We test the empirical relevance of the fiscal dominance hypothesis for Colombia and Venezuela, estimating vector error-correction and unrestricted vector autoregression models with annual and quarterly data. Our hypothesis that under a managed exchange rate regime, fiscal dominance should imply a dynamic relationship between fiscal deficits and net domestic credit is not supported by the data. Using either the net domestic credit to trend output ratio or the logarithm of the monetary base to trend output ratio, we find for both countries that the fiscal dominance hypothesis receives, at best, weak support. Fiscal deficits and/or the rate of growth of the monetary base to trend output, however, have an important effect on the behavior of inflation, but not on the real exchange rate or the stock of net international reserves. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBending {{an elastic}} beam {{leads to a}} {{complicated}} 3 D stress distribution, but the shear and transverse stresses are so small in a slender beam that a good approximation is obtained by assuming purely uniaxial stress. In this paper, we demonstrate that {{the same is true}} for a saturated poroelastic beam. Previous studies of poroelastic beams have shown that, to satisfy the Beltrami–Michell compatibility conditions, it is necessary to introduce either a normal transverse stress or shear stresses in addition to the bending stress. The problem is further complicated if lateral diffusion is permitted. In this study, a fully coupled finite element analysis (FEA) incorporating the lateral diffusion effect is presented. Results predicted by the “exact” numerical solution, including load relaxation, pore pressure, stresses and strains, are compared to an approximate analytical solution that <b>incorporates</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumptions</b> of simple beam theory. The applicability of the approximate beam-bending solution is investigated by comparing it to FEA simulations of beams with various aspect ratios. For “beams” with large width-to-height ratios, the Poisson effect causes vertical deflections that cannot be neglected. It is suggested that a theory of plate bending is needed in the case of poroelastic media with large width-to-height ratios. Nevertheless, use of the approximate solution yields very small errors over the range of width-to-height ratios (viz., 1 – 4) explored with FEA...|$|E
