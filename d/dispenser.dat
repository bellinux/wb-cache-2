5|$|Another {{charter of}} Theobald's from about 1152 shows the usual {{household}} staff that surrounded him. It was witnessed by the archbishop's crossbearer, three of Theobald's nephews and the clerk who presumably {{was in charge}} of them, a chancellor, two chaplains who were monks, a butler, <b>dispenser,</b> chamberlain, steward, cook, usher, porter and marshal. Theobald also {{at about the same time}} granted a mill to his baker named William and some lands to his cook William and the cook's heirs.|$|E
5|$|Other funded {{improvements}} to the A-10 fleet include a new data link, the ability to employ smart weapons such as the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and Wind Corrected Munitions <b>Dispenser,</b> {{and the ability to}} carry an integrated targeting pod such as the Northrop Grumman LITENING or the Lockheed Martin Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP). Also included is the Remotely Operated Video Enhanced Receiver (ROVER) to provide sensor data to personnel on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Solar deities play a {{major role}} in many world {{religions}} and mythologies. The ancient Sumerians believed that the sun was Utu, the god of justice and twin brother of Inanna, the Queen of Heaven, who was identified as the planet Venus. Later, Utu was identified with the East Semitic god Shamash. Utu was regarded as a helper-deity, who aided those in distress, and, in iconography, he is usually portrayed with a long beard and clutching a saw, which represented his role as the <b>dispenser</b> of justice.|$|E

50|$|Manual <b>dispensers</b> of foam soap often {{consist of}} a large button which squeezes the foam out of a tube. Many liquid soap <b>dispensers</b> operate in this way as well. A few <b>dispensers</b> operate with a lever that pulls forward and squeezes the soap out.|$|R
50|$|In 1977, Tobin {{founded and}} served as CEO to Cal Pack Industries, Inc., which invented and sold {{patented}} plastic <b>dispensers</b> for disposable cups and napkins, {{eliminating the need for}} restaurants to use expensive metal <b>dispensers.</b> The <b>dispensers</b> are still in common use. Tobin remained CEO until 1985.|$|R
5|$|Draught {{beer from}} a {{pressurised}} keg using a lever-style <b>dispenser</b> and a spout {{is the most}} common method of dispensing in bars around the world. A metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet. Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. Nitrogen produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel. Some types of beer can also be found in smaller, disposable kegs called beer balls. In traditional pubs, the pull levers for major beer brands may include the beer's logo and trademark.|$|E
5|$|Marketing {{included}} an MS-DOS computer game, {{part of an}} increasing trend of game tie-ins to movies. J.M. Dillard wrote the film's novelization, which was on The New York Times Best Seller list for four weeks. Paramount sold Star Trek-branded apparel through catalogues, and Kraft made a Star Trek-branded marshmallow <b>dispenser.</b> While Star Trek had a built-in fan market, marketing tie-ins were risky {{at the time and}} even high-grossing films could not guarantee success of related merchandise. Unlike other summer blockbusters, Star Trek had no mass-market appeal and no major food or beverage promotions, but sold pins and posters in theaters, bypassing retailers.|$|E
5|$|The Conventional Enhancement Modification (CEM) program {{gave the}} B-52H a more {{comprehensive}} conventional weapons capability, adding the modified underwing weapon pylons used by conventional-armed B-52Gs, Harpoon and Have Nap, and the capability to carry new-generation weapons including the Joint Direct Attack Munition and Wind Corrected Munitions <b>Dispenser</b> guided bombs, the AGM-154 glide bomb and the AGM-158 JASSM missile. The CEM program also introduced new radios, integrated Global Positioning System into the aircraft's navigation system and replaced the under-nose FLIR with a more modern unit. Forty-seven B-52Hs were modified under the CEM program by 1996, with 19 more {{by the end of}} 1999.|$|E
50|$|World War II slowed {{marketing}} and production. In 1945, manufacturers devised and promoted the Pez Box Regular. In 1952 Eduard Haas introduced his product to the United States, and Curtis Allina headed Pez's U.S. business. In 1955, the Pez company placed heads on the <b>dispensers</b> and marketed them for children. Santa Claus and Mickey Mouse {{were among the}} first character <b>dispensers.</b> Since 1950, over 1500 Pez <b>dispensers,</b> including the original character <b>dispensers,</b> have been created.|$|R
50|$|The mines were {{typically}} deployed from SUU-41A/A and SUU-41B/A <b>dispensers,</b> with the <b>dispensers</b> packed into cluster bomb units with between 12 and 16 <b>dispensers</b> in each cluster bomb. A single bomb could contain between 1,470 and 7,500 mines. The bombs could be dropped from aircraft at between 60 and 6000 meters and at speeds of 370 km/h to 1300 km/h. The <b>dispensers</b> would burst {{at an altitude}} of between 200 to 300 meters, scattering the mines.|$|R
5000|$|Gummed (water activated) tape <b>dispensers</b> measure, dispense, moisten, and cut gummed or water-activated {{adhesive}} tape. This tape {{is often}} {{composed of a}} paper backing and adhesive glue that is unable to adhere until it is [...] "activated" [...] by contact with water. To perform this step, gummed <b>dispensers</b> often employ a water bottle and wetting brush to moisten each piece of tape as it is dispensed. Many gummed <b>dispensers</b> feature a heater, which is mounted over the feed area to maintain the <b>dispenser’s</b> water temperature. These heaters ensure maximum wetting, and are ideal in cold climates. Gummed tape <b>dispensers</b> are often used in packaging or shipping departments for closing corrugated boxes.|$|R
5|$|While {{these six}} {{aircraft}} provided a limited tanker capability suitable for refuelling fighters, the Mk 20A wing hosereels could only deliver fuel at a limited rate, {{and were not}} suitable for refuelling bombers. Work therefore continued to produce a definitive three-point tanker conversion of the Victor Mk.1. Fourteen further B.1A and 11 B.1 were fitted with two permanently fitted fuel tanks in the bomb bay, and a high-capacity Mk 17 centreline hose <b>dispenser</b> unit with three times the fuel flow rate as the wing reels, and were designated K.1A and K.1 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp {{probably}} {{held the}} office of royal forester for Worcestershire as well as sheriff. The evidence {{for this is that}} after Beauchamp's death, his son William was granted the revenues from the royal forests of Worcestershire {{at the same rate as}} his father had held them; this strongly implies that the elder held {{the office of}} forester. The historian Judith Green felt that Walter de Beauchamp might possibly have held the office of constable, which had been held by his father-in-law, although the historian C. Warren Hollister felt that Beauchamp definitely did hold the office. He also a held the royal office of <b>dispenser,</b> an office which later became known as a butler. He acquired this because his wife inherited the office from her father. The date when he acquired the office is unknown. While a member of the royal household, Beauchamp witnessed a number of royal charters, mainly when the king was in England.|$|E
5|$|In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, {{students}} and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them. The final product is served with mayonnaise, ketchup or curry. The process takes around two minutes {{from start to}} finish, in which the product is served in a paper cup. The potato strips are stored in a frozen state inside the machine at −18°C, and it cooks them in oil at 180°C. The unit uses a specially-designed <b>dispenser</b> to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and a fork and salt are provided separately in a box.|$|E

5|$|Phase two {{was broken}} into four {{separate}} sections, phase 2.1 {{is for a}} radar upgrade, phase 2.2 incorporated a link 16 secure data link, Multi-function Information Distribution System (MIDS), Cockpit full colour displays (MDGU), Counter Measures <b>Dispenser</b> System (CMDS), Joint Helmet Mounted Cuing System (JHMCS), Tactical Air Moving Map Capability (TAMMAC), and the 19C Operational Flight Program. Phase 2.3 added the Electronic Warfare suite upgrade (Radar Warning Receiver, Radio Frequency Jammer) and phase 2.4 upgraded with the Target Designation System (HTDS). The following support systems will also be either upgraded or replaced, the Operational Flight Trainer (OFT) {{to be replaced by}} the Hornet Aircrew Training System (HACTS), the Integrated Avionics Software Support Facility (IASSF), the Mission Planning System (MPS), Miscellaneous Support Equipment (SE), Computer Based Training System (CBTS), Simulated Aircraft Maintenance Training System (SAMTS) to be replaced by the Integrated Maintenance Training System (IMTS).|$|E
5|$|Some of the ECM {{equipment}} which initially saw {{use on the}} Victor, such as {{the original}} chaff <b>dispenser</b> and Orange Putter tail warning radar, had been developed for the earlier English Electric Canberra bomber and were already considered to be near-obsolete {{by the time the}} Victor had entered service. Significant improvements and alterations would be made to the avionics and ECM suites, as effective ECMs had been deemed critical to the Victor's role; for example, the introduction of the more capable Red Steer tail warning radar. The introduction of the Victor B.2 was accompanied by several new ECM systems, including a passive radar warning receiver, a metric radar jammer and communications jamming equipment. Streamlined fairings on the trailing edges of the wings that could house large quantities of defensive chaff/flares were also new additions. While trials were conducted with terrain-following radar and a side scan mode for the bombing and navigation radar, neither of these functions were integrated into the operational fleet.|$|E
5|$|Urse {{came from}} an undistinguished family, {{and made his way}} on {{military}} reputation. He was probably born in about 1040, but the exact date is unknown. He was from St Jean d'Abbetot in Normandy, where his family had lands, and where he himself was a tenant of the lords of Tancarville. Other tenants of the Tancarville lords included Robert d'Abetot and his wife Lesza, who held lands close to St Jean d'Abbetot in the early 12th century; despite the name, it is not certain that Robert d'Abetot was related to Urse. Urse had a brother usually called Robert Despenser, sometimes known as Robert fitz Thurstin, who also became a royal official. The historian Emma Mason suggested that Urse may have been a nickname rather than a forename, perhaps given on account of his tenacious temperament. Urse's usual last name derives from his ancestral village in Normandy. His brother's usual last name of Despenser derives from his office, that of <b>dispenser,</b> in the royal household.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} training of <b>dispensers</b> on knowledge of <b>dispensers</b> working at community pharmacies in context to storage temperature, prescription terminologies and status of medicines in Islamabad, Pakistan. Method: A randomized, controlled, blinded intervention study was designed and implemented. Before the implementation of intervention, a baseline study was performed to assess the knowledge of <b>dispensers</b> working at community pharmacies. The study population included all community pharmacy outlets in Islamabad. Pharmacies of Islamabad which were visited in pre intervention phase (n= 118) {{were divided into two}} geographical regions: A (intervention) and B (control). Thirty pharmacies were randomly selected from each region. Keeping in view the results of the baseline study an educational intervention was designed to improve the knowledge of <b>dispensers</b> working at community pharmacies in Pakistan. Results: A significant difference in the overall knowledge of <b>dispensers</b> was observed between the pre-post intervention groups. Knowledge of <b>dispensers</b> regarding storage of drugs, prescription terminologies and status of drugs was improved after the training. On the other hand no significant difference was observed between the pre-post control groups. Conclusion: The study has highlighted that improvements in knowledge of <b>dispensers</b> working at community pharmacies are possible through suitable interventions. But, results of interventions can only be sustainable through continuous monitoring and reinforcement of the training...|$|R

5|$|It is Christmas in Bikini Bottom and Plankton is {{miserable and}} angry for {{committing}} so many naughty deeds, {{that he always}} gets on Santa's naughty list, making him unable to receive his Christmas wishthe Krusty Krab's Krabby Patty secret formula. However, he discovers Jerktonium, a dangerous chemical element {{which serves as a}} trap for the citizens of Bikini Bottom and is capable of turning anyone into a jerk. He cooks it into fruitcakes that he intends to feed to all the Bikini Bottomites and turn them into jerks. In order to test it, Plankton gives SpongeBob a slice, but nothing seems to work on SpongeBob, who is immune to Jerktonium because of the combination of his small brain and his very big heart. Increasingly infuriated that his plan has seemingly failed completely to suffice, Plankton gives his fruitcake <b>dispenser</b> to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini Bottom and transforms all the residents into jerks. After realizing that the element works only on other people in Bikini Bottom instead and that SpongeBob is so full of Christmas spirit that he is immune to jerktonium, Plankton is forced to send out an evil wind-up robot version of SpongeBob to commit troublesome deeds to frame the real SpongeBob.|$|E
5|$|The Anonimalle Chronicle gives a clear {{account of}} the unrest in East Anglia. On hearing of the rebellion, Henry le Despenser acted swiftly, moving through Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Norfolk {{from his home in}} Burley, Rutland. His armed force {{initially}} consisted of his personal retinue, but ultimately became a much larger force consisting of many knights and other men who had previously not dared to confront the rebels. According to the historian Edgar Powell, Henry <b>Dispenser</b> undertook the task of dealing with the revolt in his diocese and punishing the rebels. He was involved in crushing rebellions at Peterborough and elsewhere, before moving on to suppress the revolts in Cambridge. The authorities were alerted to the call in Norfolk for men to join the revolt in the name of Litster. On 17 June the rebels from the north and east of the county assembled on Mousehold Heath, outside Norwich: shortly afterwards, Sir Robert Salle, who had come out of the city to speak with the commons, was killed. According to Thomas Walsingham, the knight died soon after he was 'knocked on the head by a rustic who was one of his own serfs'. The rebels then entered Norwich and wreaked havoc, destroying property and killing several prominent citizens. Other houses and church properties within the county (such as at Yarmouth) were attacked by the rebels at this time.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} loading of sodium atoms into a {{magneto-optical}} trap from current-controlled sodium metal <b>dispensers.</b> Contrary {{to what was}} previously reported [V. Wippel, C. Binder, W. Huber, L Windholz, M. Allegrini, F. Fuso, E. Arimondo, Eur. Phys. J. D 17 (2001) 2851 we demonstrate a significantly higher number of trapped atoms that make Na <b>dispensers</b> a feasible source of atoms for cold-atom studies. The inherent rise in pressure that naturally arises from metal <b>dispensers</b> as they are heated to release atoms is partially controlled by placing the metal <b>dispensers</b> near the pumping port where an ion pump is connected. We also {{study the effects of}} placing the sodium <b>dispensers</b> at different distances from the main vacuum chamber where the atoms are trapped and the effectiveness of using a Zeeman slower to cool the atoms as they emerge from the <b>dispensers.</b> We observe trapping of up to 1. 9 x 10 (8) atoms, which is significantly higher by almost three orders of magnitude than previously reported experiments.
