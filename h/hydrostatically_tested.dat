40|$|AbstractA smart oar blade with piezoresistive sensors {{on either}} side was developed, calibrated, and <b>tested</b> <b>{{hydrostatic}}ally,</b> hydrodynamically and during rowing. The hydrostatic test down to a water depth of 0. 7 m returned the correct and expected pressure values (r 2 = 0. 9953). In the hydrodynamic test, the peak differential pressure ranged from 100 Pa to 150 Pa, corresponding to a blade velocity and displacement of approximately 0. 5 m/s and 0. 5 m. In the rowing tests, the peak differential pressure was approximately 800 Pa, corresponding to a blade velocity and displacement of approximately 1. 15 m/s and 0. 9 m. The large displacement may result from {{the shape of the}} boat (gentlemen's skiff) and its load (3 people) ...|$|R
50|$|Pressure {{vessel design}} {{involves}} Barlow's formula, {{used to calculate}} the required wall thickness. However, the design of a complex pressure containment system involves much more than the application of this formula. For almost all pressure vessels, the ASME code stipulates the requirements for design and testing. Prior to delivery, the pressure vessel is <b>hydrostatically</b> <b>tested</b> at 130% of its rated pressure under the supervision of an ASME code inspector. It is filled with water, and a small pump raises the pressure to the necessary test value, at which it is held for a specified time (30 minutes according to the ASME code). The inspector checks for leaks as well as evidence of flaws or inadequacies in the welding.|$|E
50|$|The {{ships are}} of the {{conventional}} DSV design, with spherical habitable pressure hull of 2.1 meter diameter and 100 mm thickness welded from titanium alloy, with buoyancy provided by domestically produced syntactic foam. Habitable hull fits two crew with an optional passenger/mission specialist, and is equipped with three viewports in the frontal side and external cameras. Pressure hull assembly is <b>hydrostatically</b> <b>tested</b> to withstand 720 at pressure, while the viewports are tested up to 780 at. Propulsion is supplied by three main engines with ducted propellers in the stern, while two additional vertical and one lateral impellers ensure the maneurability. Both ships are equipped with two heavy-duty robotic arms, capable of handling up to 200 kg loads, {{and are able to}} carry and control ROVs. The endurance is mainly limited by capacity of their main batteries, which are capable of holding enough charge for 10-12 hours of operation.|$|E

40|$|The {{commonly}} used British Standard constant head triaxial permeability test for testing of fine-grained soils is relatively time consuming. A {{reduction in the}} required time for soil permeability testing would provide potential cost savings to the construction industry, particularly in the construction quality assurance of landfill clay liners. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to evaluate an alternative approach of measuring permeability of fine-grained soils benefiting from accelerated time scaling for seepage flow when testing specimens in elevated gravity conditions provided by a centrifuge. As part of the investigation, an apparatus was designed and produced to measure water flow through soil samples under conditions of elevated gravitational acceleration using a small desktop laboratory centrifuge. A membrane was used to <b>hydrostatically</b> confine the <b>test</b> sample. A miniature data acquisition system was designed and incorporated in the apparatus to monitor and record changes in head and flow throughout the tests. Under enhanced gravity in the centrifuge, the flow through the sample was under ‘variable head' conditions as opposed to ‘constant head' conditions as in the classic constant head permeability tests conducted at 1 g. A mathematical model was developed for analysis of Darcy's coefficient of permeability under conditions of elevated gravitational acceleration and verified using the results obtained. The test data compare well with the results on analogous samples obtained using the classical British Standard constant head permeability tests...|$|R
40|$|The {{inner vessel}} heads {{including}} bypass and beam tubes {{had just been}} welded into place and dye penetrant checked. The vacuum heads were not on at this time but the vacuum shell was on covering the piping penetrating into the inner vessel. Signal boxes with all feed through boards, the instrumentation box, and high voltage boxes were all installed with their pump outs capped. All 1 / 4 -inch instrumentation lines were terminated at their respective shutoff valves. All vacuum piping used for pumping down the inner vessel was isolated using o-ring sealed blind flanges. PV 215 A (VAT Series 12), the 4 -inch VRC gate valve isolating the cyropump, and the rupture disk {{had to be removed}} and replaced with blind flanges before pressurizing due to their pressure limitations. Stresses in plates used as blind flanges were checked using Code calcualtions. Before the CC test, vacuum style blanks and clamps were <b>hydrostatically</b> pressure <b>tested</b> to 150 % of the maximum test pressure, 60 psig. The Code inspector and Research Division Safety had all given their approval to the test pressure and procedure prior to filling the vessel with argon. The test was a major success. Based on the lack of any distinguishable pressure drop indicated on the pressure gages, the vessel appeared to be structurally sound throughout the duration of the test (approx. 3 hrs.). A major leak in the instrumentation tubing was discovered at half of the maximum test pressure and was quickly isolated by crimping and capping with a compression fitting. There were some slight deviations in the actual procedure used. The 44 psig relief valve located just outside the cleanroom had to be capped until the pressure in the vessel indicated 38 psi. This was to allow higher supply pressures and hence, higher flows through the pressurizing line. Also, in order to get pressure readings at the cryostat without exposing any personnel to the potentially dangerous stored energy near the maximum test pressure, a camera was installed {{at the top of the}} vessel to view the indicator mounted there. The monitor was viewed at the ante room adjacent to the cleanroom. The holding pressure of 32 psig (4 / 5 of the maximum test pressure) was only maintained for about 20 minutes instead of the half hour recommendation in the procedure. We felt that this was sufficient time to Snoop test and perform the pressure drop test. After the test was completed, the inspector for CBI Na-Con and the Research Divison Safety Officer signed all of required documentation...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{fabricating}} composite pressure vessels having toroidal geometry was evaluated. Eight units were fabricated using fibrous graphite material wrapped over a thin-walled aluminum liner. The material was wrapped using a machine designed for wrapping, the graphite material was impregnated with an epoxy resin that was subsequently thermally cured. The units were fabricated using various winding patterns. They were <b>hydrostatically</b> <b>tested</b> {{to determine their}} performance. The method of fabrication was demonstrated. However, the improvement in performance to weight ratio over that obtainable by an all metal vessel probably does not justify the extra cost of fabrication...|$|E
40|$|A 71 cm {{diameter}} 74 cm length boron/epoxy composite {{rocket motor}} chamber was designed {{based on the}} geometric configuration of the JPL Applications Technology Satellite titanium alloy apogee motor chamber. Because analyses showed large stress concentrations in the domes, the configuration was modified using the same basic constraints for openings and attachments. The rocket motor chamber was then fabricated by filament winding with boron/epoxy tape and <b>hydrostatically</b> <b>tested</b> to failure at 264 N/sq cm, 57. 2 N/sq cm above the design value. Two more rocket motor chambers were fabricated with the same basic constraints, but shortened to 57. 6 cm for a smaller propellant load. The first of these short chambers failed in proof because of filament winding fabrication difficulties. The second chamber was successfully fabricated and passed the hydrostatic proof test...|$|E
40|$|The author {{contributed a}} brief {{account of the}} {{radiographic}} practices necessary to comply with government specifications to a round table discussion on inspection methods at the last American Society for Metals Convention, and later was able to release for publication in Metal Progress {{a full set of}} the radiographic standards set up about a year ago to govern acceptance of structural castings for airplanes. Representaive negatives are reproduced in this article. Those eliminated are either of similar defects which did not register strong enough to appear on an engraving without retouching, or of defects readily observed by visual inspection without X-ray. Towards the end of 1941 it became imperative that general standards for the acceptance of aircraft castings be established. At that time the commercial standards for the acceptance or rejection were largely intangible; castings rejected by one radiographic laboratory were later accepted by another. As a check on the validity of commercial X-ray inspection, rejected castings were subjected to breakdown or tensile tests conducted upon specimens machined from castings, and many were found to have strengths considerably in excess of design or specification values. Pressure of increased aircraft production made such a waste of material intolerable. As remarked at the outset it became necessary to establish an inspection procedure which would insure that: 1. No casting which might fail would find its way into an airplane structure. 2. A minimum number of usable parts would be discarded by unnecessarily rigid inspection standards, and 3. The inspection procedure be as economical of manpower and materials as was consistent with the first two aims. To achieve these ends, a procedure for the X-ray examination of structural castings which attempted to resolve these principles was adopted by the Army Air Forces in February, 1942. An outline of the procedure and some representative radiographs will be given, principally applicable to sand and permanent mold castings of aluminum or magnesium alloys used in the airplane 2 ̆ 7 s structure. Castings for use in hydraulic systems need not be X-rayed if they are <b>hydrostatically</b> <b>tested</b> unless sections of these castings are also subject to structural loads, whereupon such sections are subject to the same requirements as structural castings...|$|E
40|$|Many of the {{mechanical}} equipment failures at the Laboratory are due {{to the loss of}} cooling water. In order to insure the proper operating temperatures and to increase the reliability of {{the mechanical}} equipment in the D 0 Cryo Utilities Room it is necessary to provide an independent liquid cooling system. To this end, an enclosed glycoVwater cooling system which transfers heat from two vane-type vacuum pumps and an air compressor to the outside air has been installed in the Cryo Utilities Room. From the appended list {{it can be seen that}} only the Thermal Precision PFC- 121 -D and Ingersoll-Rand WAC 16 deserve closer investigation based on price. The disadvantages of the WAC 16 are that: it runs a little warmer, it requires more valving to properly install a backup pump, inlet and outlet piping are not included, and temperature and pressure indicators are not included. Its only advantage is that it is $ 818 cheaper than the PFC- 121 -D. The advantages of the PFC- 121 -D are that: it has automatic pump switching during shutdown, it has a temperature regulator on one fan control, it has a switch which indicates proper operation, has a sight glass on the expansion tank, and comes with an ASME approved expansion tank and relief valve. For these reasons the Thermal Precision PFC- 121 -D was chosen. In the past, we have always found the pond water to be muddy and to sometimes contain rocks of greater than 1 / 2 inch diameter. Thus a system completely dependent on the pond water from the accelerator was deemed unacceptable. A closed system was selected based on its ability to greatly improve reliability, while remaining economical. It is charged with a 50 / 50 glycol/water mixture capable of withstanding outside temperatures down to - 33 F. The fluid will be circulated by a totally enclosed air cooled Thermal Precision PFC- 121 -D pump. The system will be on emergency power and an automatically controlled backup pump, identical to the primary, is available should the main pump fail. The fan unit is used as a primary cooler and the trim cooler cools the fluid further on extremely hot days. The trim cooler has also been sized to cool the system in the event of a total shutdown provided that the pond water supply has adequate pressure. Due to a broken filter, we found it necessary to install a strainer in the pond water supply line. The expansion tank separates air bubbles, ensures a net positive suction head, protects against surges and over pressurization of the system, and allows for the filling of the system without shutting it off. All piping has been installed, flushed, charged with the glycol/water mix, and <b>hydrostatically</b> <b>tested</b> to 55 psi. The condition of all pumps and flow conditions will be recorded at the PLC. It has been decided not to include the regulator valve in the pond water return line. This valve was designated by the manufacturer to reduce the amount of water flowing through the trim cooler. This is not necessary in our application. There is some concern that the cooling fluid may cool the mechanical eqUipment too much when they are not operating or during very cold days. This issue will be addressed and the conclusion appended to this engineering note...|$|E
