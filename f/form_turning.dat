500|$|Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor indefinitely stabilizes the Gangers' {{forms to}} ensure that they remain human permanently, while {{providing}} Cleaves with a cure to her terminal condition. He takes the Ganger Jimmy to meet the real Jimmy's son and drops the factory crew at their headquarters where they plan to reveal the truth of the Flesh to humanity. As the TARDIS crew turns to leave, Amy starts feeling contractions. Back aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor admits his trip to the factory was planned: he wanted to investigate the Flesh in its raw form, as he has known for some time that Amy is a Ganger herself. He promises her that he will find her and then disrupts her <b>form,</b> <b>turning</b> her back to raw Flesh. Amy wakes in a pristine white tube; a slot opens on a wall revealing the [...] "Eye Patch Lady", who informs Amy she is [...] "ready to pop, aren't you". Amy looks down at herself, finding herself fully pregnant, and starts entering labour.|$|E
500|$|Putana (also {{called as}} poothani), the [...] "killer of infants", {{was sent by}} Krishna's evil uncle Kamsa to kill Krishna. Putana assumed the {{disguise}} of a young, beautiful woman and came to Gokul (Vraj) - Krishna's home-town. Her beauty resulted in her being mistaken by gopas (cowherds) {{as a manifestation of}} goddess Lakshmi. Stunned by her beauty, Krishna's foster-mother Yashoda allowed Putana to take the infant Krishna into her lap and breast-feed him. Putana had smeared her breast with a mandana, an intoxicant, to kill Krishna. [...] However, Krishna squeezed her breasts and took her life away(prana), as well as her milk. (Putana had got blessing [...] in her previous life from Lord Vishnu that she will meet lord Vishnu's avtaar in human form in her next life but she forgot about it). In pain, Putana screamed, pleading for her release, but in vain. She ran out of the town with Krishna still clinging to her and finally fell dead. [...] She then assumed her real demonic <b>form,</b> <b>turning</b> trees to a distance of three gavyuti (a unit of distance equivalent totally to 12 miles) to dust. The people of Vraj cut Putana's body, burying her bones and feet and burning the flesh and skin. The fragrant smoke rose out of the flames, as Putana was cleansed of all sin by breast-feeding Krishna and she attained the same heaven that Yashoda acquired. Thus, Putana, like Yashodha, is also considered as a foster-mother of Krishna as she breast-fed him.|$|E
500|$|Lionel Green of the Sand Mountain Reporter {{named the}} entry the {{greatest}} {{episode of the}} series and called the ending [...] "one of the most uplifting finales in the series." [...] Writing for the Daily News, Eric Mink gave the episode a rating of four stars and praised it as an outstanding episode in a weak early fifth season of the show. He said that the two leads acted flawlessly and that Chris Owens' performance as The Great Mutato was especially touching. He concluded that, [...] "ith Shelley's classic as inspiration, Carter and company have created a classic of their own." [...] Elaine Linere from the Corpus Christi Caller-Times called the episode [...] "brilliantly written" [...] and named it [...] "a classic among many for this always-intriguing, ever-inventive series."

Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe called the episode [...] "a memorable X-Files from start to finish", {{due in part to}} its [...] "extraordinary visual flair" [...] and [...] "atmospheric black and white" [...] footage. Furthermore, Gilbert positively critiqued Carter's writing and directing, saying he [...] "keeps his balance between drama, low-key humor, [...] allusive wit". Margaret Lyons of New York called the entry [...] "one of the great TV episodes of all time". Nick De Semlyen and James White of Empire named it the fifth [...] "greatest" [...] episode of the series and wrote that [...] " [...] plays with style and <b>form,</b> <b>turning</b> the entire episode into a loving homage to Universal monster movies in general and James Whale's 1931 Frankenstein in particular". In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus" [...] was presented as the [...] "Best Stand-Alone Episode".

2500|$|Kyle Charizanis of The Fandom Post {{found the}} anime {{portrayal}} of Eren's transformation to be amusing, starting from his [...] "almost pitiful" [...] look while declaring how he's {{going to kill}} all of the Titans. When the anime portrays him as capable of controlling his transformation, Charizanis adds [...] "Maybe one day he’ll be able to contort his body {{to be used as}} a bridge, or heal other people’s wounds, or morph his arms into sharp blades like a certain other anime character." [...] In the final anime episode, when Eren is fighting the Female Titan, he describes Eren's internal monologue as changing [...] "from the usual violent determination to a kind of gleeful madness." [...] and likens his tone to that of The Joker. Elijah Watson from Complex magazine liked the plot twist of Eren's titan <b>form</b> <b>turning</b> on the other titans that he called it a Worldstar moment. Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network was fond on Eren's Titan abilities as [...] "there has not been anything as uncomfortable for me to watch as Eren chomping into his own hand, trying to transform.

But, accustomed to obedience and bewildered with her grief, she hesitated no longer. The head of Narra-mattah sunk on her bosom, as she left him, and her face was buried in her robe. The step with which she passed Uncas was so light as to be inaudible; but when he saw her tottering <b>form,</b> <b>turning</b> swiftly, he stretched an arm high in the air.

60|$|The play {{opens with}} a scene between one Wilding and his ward Penelope, in which he {{attempts}} to seduce the young lady, in language which has certainly the merit of honesty. She refuses him, but civilly enough; and on her departure Mrs. Wilding enters, who, it seems, {{is the object of}} her husband's loathing, though young, handsome, and in all respects charming enough. After a scene of stupid and brutal insults, he actually asks her to bring Penelope to him, at which she naturally goes out in anger; and Hazard, the gamester, enters,--a personage without a character, in any sense of the word. There is next some talk against duelling, sensible enough, which arises out of a bye-plot,--one Delamere having been wounded in a duel by one Beaumont, mortally as is supposed. This bye-plot runs through the play, giving an opportunity for bringing in a father of the usual play-house type,--a Sir Richard Hurry, who is, of course, as stupid, covetous, proud, and tyrannical and unfeeling, as play- house fathers were then bound to be: but it is a plot of the most commonplace <b>form,</b> <b>turning</b> on the stale trick of a man expecting to be hanged for killing some one who turns out after all to have recovered, and having no bearing whatsoever on the real plot, which is this,--Mrs. Wilding, in order to win back her husband's affections, persuades Penelope to seem to grant his suit; while Mrs. Wilding herself is in reality to supply her niece's place, and shame her husband into virtue. Wilding tells Hazard of the good fortune which he fancies is coming, in scenes of which one can only say, that if they are not written for the purpose of exciting the passions, {{it is hard to see}} why they were written at all. But, being with Hazard in a gambling-house at the very hour at which he is to meet Penelope, and having had a run of bad luck, he borrows a hundred pounds of Hazard, stays at the table to recover his losses, and sends Hazard to supply his place with the supposed Penelope. A few hours before Penelope and Hazard have met for the first time, and Penelope considers him, as she says to herself aside, 'a handsome gentleman.' He begins, of course, talking foully to her; and the lady, so far from being shocked at the freedom of her new acquaintance, pays him back in his own coin in such good earnest that she soon silences him in the battle of dirt-throwing. Of this sad scene it is difficult to say whether it indicates a lower standard of purity and courtesy in the poet, in the audience who endured it, or in the society of which it was, of course, intended to be a brilliant picture. If the cavaliers and damsels of Charles the First's day were in the habit of talking in that way to each other (and if they had not been, Shirley would not have dared to represent them as doing so), one cannot much wonder that the fire of God was needed to burn up (though, alas! only for a while) such a state of society; and that when needed the fire fell.|$|E

Black Zero's body was then shattered by Jax-Ur, in recompense {{for what he had}} done to Krypton. This story suggests that were it not for something none of them knew, Jor-El would have been wrong and the Science Council right. E. Nelson Bridwell hypothesized that what Black Zero had noticed was the Green Lantern Tomar Re's attempts to prevent the destruction (as seen in Superman (vol. 1) #257 (1972)), meaning the two sets of interference canceled each other out, and Jor-El was right.|$|E
