50|$|<b>Hill</b> <b>farming</b> {{is a type}} of {{agricultural}} practice in the UK in upland regions. In England, <b>hill</b> <b>farms</b> are located mainly in the North and South-Western regions, as well as a few areas bordering Wales. The Scottish highlands are another home for many <b>hill</b> <b>farms.</b> Sheep farms and mixed sheep and cattle farms constitute approximately 55% of the agricultural land in Scotland. These areas have a harsh climate, short growing seasons, relatively poor quality of soil and long winters. Therefore, these areas are considered to be disadvantaged and the animals raised there are generally less productive and farmers will often send them down to the lowlands to be fattened up.|$|R
