5|$|In {{early summer}} 1165, Pope Alexander III wrote twice to Foliot, {{ordering}} him to intercede {{with the king}} and protest the royal injunction against appeals to the papacy. Foliot replied that the king respected the pope, heard his protests carefully, and that the archbishop had not been expelled, but had left of his own accord. Foliot wrote that the king had said Becket was free to return at any time, but would still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> to the charges he had faced at Northampton. Foliot then advised the pope not to impose any sentences of excommunication and to be patient and continue to negotiate. In 1166, Foliot accused Becket of simony, or the purchase of church offices, basing this on the alleged purchase Becket had made of the chancellorship, {{although there is no}} evidence that Becket bought the office. By 1166, the king had made Foliot the head of the English Church, in fact if not in law. The king and Foliot got along well, and it was probably Foliot's influence that kept the king from more violent measures against Becket.|$|E

500|$|In a {{commentary}} in the Financial Times entitled [...] "Olympus's deceit was dishonourable", John Gapper noted that [...] "It {{is still possible}} {{to believe that the}} accused trio of directors... thought they were behaving honourably... failure discreetly and not to make their predecessors lose face." [...] He noted that accounting scandals were not uniquely Japanese, but that it was [...] "a nice piece of corporate satire to conceal losses by exploiting the widespread habit of paying too much for acquisitions and writing them down [...] the 'advisory fee' was especially creative". Gapper criticised the weakness in governance, particularly how 12 out of 15 directors were either executives or former executives of the company, and that Hideo Yamada, head of the Audit Board, was complicit in the scam. He also noted that auditors KPMG and Ernst & Young would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> tough questions about why the manipulation was never discovered or properly questioned.|$|E
500|$|The SCLC {{decided that}} {{economic}} pressure on Birmingham businesses {{would be more}} effective than pressure on politicians, a lesson learned in Albany as few blacks were registered to vote in 1962. In the spring of 1963, before Easter, the Birmingham boycott intensified during the second-busiest shopping season of the year. Pastors urged their congregations to avoid shopping in Birmingham stores in the downtown district. For six weeks supporters of the boycott patrolled the downtown area to make sure blacks were not patronizing stores that promoted or tolerated segregation. If black shoppers were found in these stores, organizers confronted them and shamed them into participating in the boycott. Shuttlesworth recalled a woman whose $15 hat ($ in [...] ) was destroyed by boycott enforcers. Campaign participant Joe Dickson recalled, [...] "We had to go under strict surveillance. We had to tell people, say look: if you go downtown and buy something, you're going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> to us." [...] After several business owners in Birmingham took down [...] "white only" [...] and [...] "colored only" [...] signs, Commissioner Connor told business owners that if they did not obey the segregation ordinances, they would lose their business licenses.|$|E

500|$|Several {{critics have}} {{acknowledged}} Clair's influence on female African American lawyers Olivia Pope and Annalise Keating {{from the television}} dramas Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder, respectively. Clair's influence on fictional female lawyers in television, particularly Alicia Florrick's dual role as mother and lawyer in the legal drama The Good Wife, has been dubbed [...] "the Clair Huxtable effect" [...] by the media. Much like Clair, Alicia is often forced to defend her decision to work while raising her family. Pastes Shannon M. Houston concluded, [...] "because someone like Clair Huxtable shared her feminism in the home, someone like Alicia Florrick can now share it in the courtrooms". Crediting Clair with pioneering [...] "the feminist, TV lawyer", the character's impact extends to include Diane Lockhart from The Good Wife and Abby Whelan from Scandal. Rainbow Johnson from the sitcom Black-ish is often compared to Clair. In 2015, Elle dubbed Rainbow [...] "the next Clair Huxtable"; the character often asks herself [...] "What would Clair Huxtable do?" [...] when struggling to parent her own children. Conversely, in 2014 Dr. Mlsee Harris of The Huffington Post published an article asking [...] "Where Is This Generation’s Clair Huxtable?", believing that characters like Clair continue to be scarce in modern-day television despite the character's success and popularity; The Daily Dots Nico Lang agreed that it is television's responsibility to [...] "create 100 more women like , ones that won’t <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> for their creator's sins." ...|$|E
500|$|At the Twenty-Second Congress of the CPSU in October {{that year}} Khrushchev openly {{attacked}} the Albanian leadership, proclaiming Hoxha a [...] "leftist nationalist deviationist" [...] {{and calling for}} his overthrow, declaring that, [...] "We are certain the time will come when the Albanian communists and the Albanian people will have their say, and then the Albanian leaders will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> for the harm they have done their country, their people {{and the cause of}} socialist construction in Albania." [...] He further stated that [...] "The imperialists are always prepared to pay thirty pieces of silver to those who split the Communist ranks." [...] To this Hoxha replied in a November 7 speech, [...] "the Albanian people and their Party of Labor will even live on grass if need be, but they will never sell themselves 'for 30 pieces of silver'... They would rather die honourably on their feet than live in shame on their knees." [...] Nicholas C. Pano noted that [...] " [...] pronouncements , at least insofar as the Soviet leadership was concerned, had made the policies of de-Stalinization, peaceful coexistence, and reconciliation with Yugoslavia adopted at the Twentieth Congress of the CPSU binding upon the members of the communist system." [...] Despite Albanian calls for the continued existence of state relations between the two countries, the Soviet government formally withdrew its ambassador on November 25 and on December 3 withdrew [...] "the whole personnel of its embassy and commercial representation from the PRA, {{while at the same time}} demanding that the personnel of the Albanian embassy and the Albanian commercial adviser should leave the territory of the Soviet Union." [...] "Thus," [...] the Albanian account continues, [...] "the Khrushchev revisionist group, consistent in its line, cut off all relations with socialist Albania at a time when it maintained contacts with and was drawing ever closer to the most reactionary regimes of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1997, Warner Bros. {{approached}} cult filmmaker {{and comic}} book writer Kevin Smith, who had then just finished writing Superman Lives, to script a Green Lantern film. Smith {{turned down the}} offer, believing there were more suitable candidates to make a Green Lantern film. At one point Quentin Tarantino was offered the chance to write and direct. Warner also considered the property as an action comedy; by 2004, Robert Smigel had completed a script which was set to star Jack Black in the lead role. However, the studio dropped the comedy idea following poor fan reaction from the Internet. David S. Goyer was offered the chance to write and direct either a Green Lantern or Flash film after Warner Bros. was impressed with his screenplay for Batman Begins, but he opted to direct the latter. Actor-writer Corey Reynolds, a comic book fan of the John Stewart character, pitched Warner {{an idea for a}} trilogy, with him starring as John Stewart and performing screenwriting duties. Reynolds intended to introduce Hal Jordan, the Green Lantern Corps and Justice League in possible sequels. He finished the script for Green Lantern: Birth of a Hero in June 2007, receiving positive feedback from Warner Bros. with a potential 2010 release date. However, the studio abandoned Reynolds' concept, and in October 2007, Greg Berlanti signed to direct the film and co-write it with comic-book writers Michael Green and Marc Guggenheim. A draft of the trio's 2008 script, leaked on the Internet, revealed a story that included the hero's origin and included the characters Carol Ferris, Kilowog, Sinestro, and Guy Gardner in a cameo appearance, and appeared [...] "to set up Hector Hammond as Hal Jordan's ... first major nemesis...." [...] Shortly afterward, Guggenheim said that the script would contain characterizations inspired by the Denny O'Neil-Neal Adams run on the comic in the 1970s, and Dave Gibbons' work in the early 1980s. He added that he and his co-writers also looked to the 2000s Geoff Johns stories, saying, [...] "It’s been interesting because we finished a draft just before [...] '' [...] started up. [...] "So I’ve been reading 'Secret Origin' with a real interest in seeing 'OK, how did Geoff solve this problem?' There are certain elements just for anyone trying to retell Hal’s origin for a modern day audience has to address and grapple with. For example, why the hell was Abin [...] flying in a space ship when he's a Green Lantern? You don't ask that question back in the Silver Age, but when you're writing in the Modern Age, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> these things." ...|$|E
