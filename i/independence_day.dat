5|$|As {{early as}} {{three years after}} independence, the Naga National Council called for a boycott of <b>Independence</b> <b>Day</b> in {{northeast}} India.

With increasing insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir from the late 1980s, separatist protesters boycotted <b>Independence</b> <b>Day</b> there with bandh (strikes), use of black flags and by flag burning. Terrorist outfits such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Hizbul Mujahideen and the Jaish-e-Mohammed have issued threats, and have carried out attacks around <b>Independence</b> <b>Day.</b> Boycotting of the celebration has also been advocated by insurgent Maoist rebel organisations.|$|E
