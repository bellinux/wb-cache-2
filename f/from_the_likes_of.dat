5|$|Turner's {{painting}} achieved widespread critical acclaim, and accolades <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> John Ruskin and William Makepeace Thackeray. It was Turner's particular favourite; he only lent it {{once and}} refused to ever do so again. He also refused to sell it at any price, and on his death bequeathed it to the nation. It hangs today in the National Gallery, and in 2005 it was voted the nation's favourite painting in a poll organized by BBC Radio 4's Today programme.|$|E
5|$|Amid loud outcry, Playford {{started a}} Royal Commission {{to review the}} case. However, two of the Commissioners appointed, Chief Justice Mellis Napier and Justice Geoffrey Reed, had already been involved, Napier as {{presiding}} judge in the Full Court appeal and Reed as the trial judge. This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> the President of the Indian Bar Council, the esteemed British judge Norman Birkett, {{the leader of the}} United Kingdom Liberal Party Jo Grimond and former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. Years later, Playford admitted that he erred in his appointments of Reed and Napier and that it could have shaken public confidence on the fairness of the hearing.|$|E
50|$|In the 18th century, Sir John Riggs Miller, 1st Baronet and Anna Miller held a much-mocked {{fortnightly}} literary salon {{along with}} competitions and prizes {{at their house}} in the village. The couple there held a fortnightly literary salon along with competitions and prizes. Distinguished contributions were received <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>like</b> <b>of</b> David Garrick, Christopher Anstey and the poet Anna Seward.|$|R

40|$|Conventionally speaking, {{the current}} Muslim law of {{inheritance}} is habitually {{considered as a}} sufficient and final form of legal formula that reflects the true spirit of Islamic Law ordained by God. The majority of Muslims currently are of belief that the ulama {{of the first generation}} have passed down to us the most complete and sophisticated set of law based on their acute interpretation of the Qur’an and the Sunnah. This belief however has now been subjected to a severe criticism by the contemporary critiques especially <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>like</b> <b>of</b> David S. Powers. His Studies in Qur’an and Hadith: The Formulation of the Islamic Law of Inheritance that employs the historical and literary criticism approach discovered that there are other sides of Muslim inheritance law. This work challenges the established belief among the traditional Muslims and offers a new legal paradigm whereby a legal ruling must bee seen as reflecting a social and historical dimension. This paper in every respect is a critical review of Powers’ book...|$|R
5|$|On 7 November 1957, after Sputnik {{and under}} {{pressure}} to bring on a dedicated science advisor, Eisenhower created the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC), which {{had the effect of}} eroding the AEC's monopoly over scientific advice. In stark contrast to the AEC, PSAC promoted a test ban and argued against Strauss's claims concerning its strategic implications and technical feasibility. In late 1957, the Soviet Union made a second offer of a three-year moratorium without inspections, but lacking any consensus within his administration, Eisenhower rejected it. In early 1958, the discord within American circles, particularly among scientists, was made clear in hearings before the Senate Subcommittee on Nuclear Disarmament, chaired by Senator Hubert Humphrey. The hearings featured conflicting testimony <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Teller and Linus Pauling, as well as from Harold Stassen, who argued that a test ban could safely be separated from broader disarmament, and AEC members, who argued that a cutoff in nuclear production should precede a test ban.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{authority}} {{on the design of}} the film was concept artist Albert Hurter. All designs used in the film, from characters' appearances to the look of the rocks in the background, had to meet Hurter's approval before being finalized. Two other concept artists— Ferdinand Hovarth and Gustaf Tenggren— also contributed to the visual style of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Hovarth developed a number of dark concepts for the film, although many other designs he developed were ultimately rejected by the Disney team as less easily translated into animation than Hurter's. Tenggren was used as a color stylist and to determine the staging and atmosphere of many of the scenes in the film, as his style borrowed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Arthur Rackham and John Bauer and thus possessed the European illustration quality that Walt Disney sought. He also designed the posters for the film and illustrated the press book. However, Hovarth didn't receive a credit for the film. Other artists to work on the film included Joe Grant, whose most significant contribution was the design for the Queen's Witch form.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the goals}} of the team for Angel of Darkness were to create more {{complicated}} puzzles and make the character of Lara Croft, together with the tone of the game, darker and more hard-edged. They also wished to compete with some of the newer action-adventure games on the market, which were providing heavy competition, and include gameplay ideas from Shenmue and the Metal Gear series. Many character movements were drawn from and based directly on movements made by real people, similar to later motion capture techniques, and the world design drew from various artists and elements of films <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Luc Besson and David Fincher. Murti Schofield, who had previously worked with Core Design, was brought in to write the story and script. As part of writing the background for the organisations involved in the story, he researched historical secret societies and artefacts, and accurate translations of Latin text incorporated into the game. Schofield created the character Kurtis Trent upon a request for someone who could become the focus of a spin-off franchise. Core spent two years trying to reshape the franchise as well as writing a back story {{in the form of a}} book separated into multiple chapters, with Angel of Darkness being the first of those chapters.|$|E
50|$|As an {{alternate}} series, the show makes {{references to the}} previous one. References range <b>from</b> <b>the</b> subtle, <b>like</b> some <b>of</b> Chiu's costumes, to <b>the</b> obvious, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> first series's theme song Happy Material utilized during the mass Pactio activation.|$|R
50|$|The book, hailed for its uncompromising honesty, {{was greeted}} in England with almost unremitting acclaim, which {{included}} an entire BBC broadcast devoted to its merits and lavish praise from Cyril Connolly and Philip Toynbee. The book eventually drew praise <b>from</b> <b>the</b> disparate <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Saul Bellow, Paul Bowles, Joseph Brodsky, William Burroughs, Arthur Miller and Dorothy Parker, but generally the appreciation on the US {{side of the}} Atlantic was more mixed.|$|R
50|$|Keca {{was born}} in Bihać, Yugoslavia. He started playing in Romania with Naţional Bucharest, a club at the time popular for foreign players <b>from</b> Eastern-Europe (<b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> his fellow Bosnian Slaviša Mitrović or Albanian Albert Duro) or Australians (Michael Thwaite, Ryan Griffiths or Jonathan McKain). With Naţional he could compete in the 2002-03 UEFA Cup, where they would edge out teams like Tirana and Heerenveen before {{eventually}} being eliminated by Paris Saint-Germain in the Second Round.|$|R
5|$|During {{his first}} term in parliament, Playford also gained {{attention}} for his unconvincing command of the English language; he developed a reputation for pronouncing common words incorrectly, bad syntax and speaking in a monotone. He continued to attack his ministers, and complaints <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Public Works Minister Herbert Hudd only encouraged Playford to further mock him. Playford also consistently opposed the liberalisation of liquor trading, having been unimpressed by the drunken behaviour he had witnessed while in the military. He continued to stridently support economic rationalism, something he would later renege on as premier. He opposed government investment in capital works {{as a means of}} generating employment and stimulating the economy during the Depression, and called for a decrease in dairy production within the state on the basis that it was more efficient to import from interstate, where rainfall was higher and grazing was more effective. Playford further criticised government subsidies to work farms designed to alleviate unemployment among Indigenous Australians, claiming that the cost exceeded that of the standard jobless payment. He also endorsed the privatisation of unprofitable state railways and denounced tariff protection as rewarding inefficiency and non-innovation. In 1936, Playford defied his party by voting against the formation of the South Australian Housing Trust. Nevertheless, despite his refusal to toe the party line, Playford was well regarded for his studious attitude to research and his preparation of his speeches.|$|E

50|$|The {{autograph}} score has not survived. Parts survive <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1730s. <b>Like</b> most <b>of</b> Bach's output, {{the music}} was not published in the composer's lifetime. It {{first appeared in the}} early nineteenth century in an edition by Johann Gottfried Schicht.|$|R

25|$|South African {{alternative}} rock {{grew more}} mainstream with two leading bands, Asylum Kids from Johannesburg and Peach from Durban having chart success and releasing critically acclaimed albums. The burgeoning music scene around Johannesburg saw {{a surge of}} small bands, inspired and informed by the UK DIY punk ethic, form and start performing at a growing number <b>of</b> venues <b>from</b> clubs <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Metalbeat, Bluebeat, King of Clubs, DV8 and Dirtbox to student run venues such as GR Bozzoli Hall and later the Free People Concert on the University of the Witwatersrand campus.|$|R
25|$|VVAW {{veterans}} {{involved with}} the WSI event then realized they needed to take control, and insisted that there be no more interference <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Lane. A new, all-veteran steering committee was formed without Lane. Ultimately, the WSI was an event produced by veterans only, without the need of civilians such as Lane and Fonda.|$|E
25|$|In the 2005–06 Australian cricket season, Joseland became {{captain of}} the Victorian 2nd XI and {{in the wake of}} departures <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Matthew Elliott and Ian Harvey, the door was open for Joseland to make a return. However, Lloyd Mash, fellow opener with the 2nd XI, scored 233 in September 2005, which saw him later make his debut for Victoria's seniors.|$|E
25|$|As the 1900s {{drew to a}} close, Franklin {{had moved}} their product line to the middle and {{high end of the}} market. The company found {{themselves}} under increasing competition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Cadillac and Packard. Franklin was pressured to introduce a new and better car every year. A new Franklin with distinctive styling was introduced in 1911 to appeal to the markets.|$|E

50|$|Mariner's third England cap came in {{the return}} World Cup {{qualifier}} in Luxembourg, scoring a last-minute goal in a 2-0 win which England really needed to win by much more {{in order to give}} themselves half a chance of qualifying for the 1978 World Cup in Argentina. By now, Mariner had become {{one of a number of}} 'target man'-type centre forwards for England coach Ron Greenwood to select <b>from,</b> with <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Stuart Pearson and Bob Latchford also on the scene. It was Mariner, however, who would get the nod for the majority of the time.|$|R
50|$|In recent years, {{these two}} albums {{have come under}} {{scrutiny}} after reaching a Western audience thanks to the internet. It {{has been found that}} multiple songs seem to take elements <b>from</b> songs by <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Curve, <b>The</b> Stone Roses, Duran Duran, PJ Harvey, and Yo La Tengo, though the liner notes list only Asaki as songwriter. These allegations have never been addressed by the band.|$|R
25|$|The area {{includes}} numerous wineries, {{ranging from}} large multi-national to small family run operations, {{which are a}} popular tourist destination. In addition to long-established names like Drayton, Lindeman's, Tulloch, Lake's Folly and Tyrrell, newer plantings <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Brokenwood Wines, Don Francois, Allandale, Petersons and Bimbadgen can be found.

25|$|The {{band has}} broken free from its {{original}} niche by courting mainstream publicity. This increased accessibility has brought coverage <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Kerrang! and MTV, along with frequent main stage appearances at major festivals such as Ozzfest, Download and even the mainstream Sziget Festival. They have sometimes been perceived as Satanic by casual observers, even though their outright lyrical references to Satanism {{are few and far}} between; their use of Satanic imagery has arguably always been more for shock value than any seriously-held beliefs.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} fit {{and finish}} of the Heathkit enclosures was not always quite up {{to the standards of}} factory-built products, but a Heathkit amplifier, for instance, did not look out of place in a living room. The technical characteristics of many Heathkits were good. The ordinary consumer would, of course, buy a factory-built phonograph <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> RCA; but an audiophile, who was serious enough to assemble a system from individual components, frequently gave serious consideration to Heathkit products (for example, the AR15 and AR1500 receivers).|$|E
50|$|Ladd-Peebles Stadium {{also played}} host to {{numerous}} other major college games over the years. Auburn played eight games at Ladd <b>from</b> 1948-55, playing <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Clemson, Florida and Ole Miss. The University of Southern Mississippi was also a consistent Ladd Stadium tenant, as the Golden Eagles played 17 games there from 1950 through 1974. Southern Mississippi's opponents included schools such as Texas A&M, Florida State and Alabama.|$|R

50|$|He {{was born}} John Miller in County Clare, Ireland. His father was John Miller and his mother, John's wife, Anne née Browne. He was educated at Dalston School and Eton College {{before joining the}} British Army in 1760 as a cornet. He was on active service in the Battle of Emsdorf and at Belleisle, France in 1761, before {{retiring}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> army in 1763. He was admitted to study at the Middle Temple in 1765, though {{does not seem to}} have made any progress with his legal studies, but studied at Trinity Hall, Cambridge though he did not graduate. In August 1765 he married Anna née Riggs (1741-1781), adding her name to his own. They had a son and a daughter. In July 1762 he inherited his family estates, though they were worth little, but his wife brought substantial wealth to the marriage, enabling him to build a prestigious house at Batheaston, Somerset. The couple there held a fortnightly literary salon along with competitions and prizes. The prizes were drawn from an ornately decorated Roman vase and the affair was mocked as Lady Miller's Vase, though that did not dissuade distinguished contributions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>like</b> <b>of</b> David Garrick and Christopher Anstey. In 1778 he was created a Baronet, of Ballicasey in the County of Clare. Anna died on 24 June 1781 and on 9 September 1795 he marrier Jane née Sell, widow of Sir Thomas Davenport. He was elected Member of Parliament for Newport, Cornwall in 1784.|$|R
25|$|The plan {{to expand}} North was mooted by {{groups within the}} SVR {{as early as the}} mid-1970s, the first plan was {{dismissed}} as impossible by the then board of the SVR. However, recent successes by others in obtaining large sums of money <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> the Heritage Lottery Fund and the European Regional Development Fund have caused this view to moderate. Telford Steam Railway have recently announced aspirations to operate into the Severn Gorge, leading a group to suggest extending the SVR northwards.|$|E
25|$|Structuralism in Europe {{developed}} in the early 1900s, in the structural linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure and the subsequent Prague, Moscow and Copenhagen schools of linguistics. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, when structural linguistics was facing serious challenges <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>likes</b> <b>of</b> Noam Chomsky and thus fading in importance, an array of scholars in the humanities borrowed Saussure's concepts for use in their respective fields of study. French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss was arguably the first such scholar, sparking a widespread interest in structuralism.|$|E
