40|$|Different {{classes of}} organic {{substances}} (acetylenic derivatives, N-containing and/or S-containing additives) wre tested as inhibitors for corrosion of ASTM a 106 plain steel and Armco iron in hot diluted HF solutions. The additives {{interacting with the}} metal surface by chemisorption through available lone pairs were the most efficient substances. The best results were obtained with S-containing additives: these markedly inhibit the acid attack both on pure iron and plain steel. Though very efficient, some S-containing additives (e. g. phenylthiourea) act as promoters of hydrogen entry into the metal lattice in HF corrosion; however, others (e. g. <b>dibenzylsulphoxide)</b> can be safely used as inhibitors in this acid solution...|$|E
