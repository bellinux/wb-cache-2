40|$|The early low-cost, wood burning Thermo-Acoustic Engine (TAE) {{known as}} Demo 2. 0 -build- 1 was {{developed}} by SCORE™ at the UK Centre and was capable of achieving 22. 7 Watts of electricity. This prototype was limited to an operating temperature of about 300 oC and due to <b>excessive</b> <b>leaks</b> could not operate continuously above ambient pressure. To absorb a thermal heat input of 4. 4 kW from the burning wood so as to fulfil the required acoustic power, the Hot Heat Exchanger (HHX) requires heating to the highest possible temperature. Therefore, a corrugated stainless steel plate HHX design that maximises heating surface area was adopted to the current Demo 2 TAE design. In addition, the system is often pressurised to achieve higher acoustic intensity. Rigorous sealing of the system at high temperature is also required. A Demo 2. 1 TAE design based on the Demo 2 TAE design and its prototype which is developed recently by the SCORE™ Centre in Malaysia was successfully constructed and well integrated with the stove. During the early construction and assembly process, fabrication difficulties and serious leak problems around the HHX’s edges were found when the apparatus operated at high temperatures. This is because the uneven geometrical HHX (convolution profile) makes it difficult and relatively costly to be sealed. The Demo 2. 1 TAE {{is focused on the}} sealing efficiency and effective manufacturing cost by meantime to allow further modification variation. The design was made to adopt the local manufacturing technologies and materials available or easy to access in Malaysia. It also aims to minimise the parasitic heat losses to lower the system onset temperature. By removing the Linear Alternator and Tuning Volume from the system, preliminary measurements shown that the apparatus was oscillating at the frequency of 70 Hz. A much lower onset temperature was observed at around 144 oC for the new configuration when the apparatus was oscillating at approximately 200 Pa. This paper describes the main design features of the Demo 2. 1 TAE including easy fabrication and assembly methodology, together with apparatus construction and rig test assessment...|$|E
500|$|Because {{the airway}} {{of a child}} is narrow, {{a small amount of}} glottic or {{tracheal}} swelling can produce critical obstruction. Inserting a tube that is too large relative to the diameter of the trachea can cause swelling. Conversely, inserting a tube that is too small can result in inability to achieve effective positive pressure ventilation due to retrograde escape of gas through the glottis and out the mouth and nose (often referred to as a [...] "leak" [...] around the tube). An <b>excessive</b> <b>leak</b> can usually be corrected by inserting a larger tube or a cuffed tube.|$|R

40|$|The soft X-ray {{experiment}} {{hardware and}} its operation are described. The device included six X-ray proportional counters, two of which, numbers 1 and 4, were pressurized with on-board methane gas supplies. Number 4 developed an <b>excessive</b> <b>leak</b> rate {{early in the}} mission and was turned off on 1975 day number 282 except for brief (typically 2 -hour) periods up to day 585 after which it as left off. Counter 1 worked satisfactorily until 1975 day number 1095 (January 1, 1978) at which time the on-board methane supply was depleted. The other four counters were sealed and all except number 3 worked satisfactorily throughout the mission which terminated with permanent satellie shut-down on day 1369. This was the first large area thin-window, gas-flow X-ray detector to be flown in orbit. The background problems were severe and consumed a very {{large portion of the}} data analysis effort.

40|$|Surface mounted {{components}} {{are being used}} increasingly in electronics, but the manufacture and assembly cause numerous problems of mechanical reliability. This is a very complicated situation {{depending on the size}} of the electronic elements as well as on the material behaviour of the various joined components. The example of a ceramic multilayer chip capacitor illustrates these problems. Ceramic materials are used as substrate or construction materials in microelectronics, especially in those cases, where hight thermal, mechanical, and electrical loads occur. Cracks in ceramic capacitors limit assembly reliability and yields. These cracks manifest themselves as electrical defects like intermittent contact, less of capacitance and <b>excessive</b> <b>leaking</b> currents. In this connection, the generation and determination of definite residual stresses seem to be an appropriate means to reach optimum properties of such ceramics. Residual stresses in a ceramic multilayer chip capacitor caused by ther mal load during sintering can arise freom several sources: - thermal stresses within the ceramics, - stresses due to the different thermal expansion of the metal-electrode (and/or the termination) and the ceramics. The X-ray stress measuring method was applied to investigate a residual stress distribution in the surface layer of the ceramic (barium titanate) capacitor. In addition, the stress gradients were measured using different diffraction lines and various radiations. In a further step, the thermal and mechanically caused stresses under operating conditions can be superimposed on the experimentally determined residual stresses by the help of finite element calculations...|$|R
50|$|A {{few hours}} later, S-36 began {{sighting}} enemy planes; and, that afternoon, {{she took up}} patrol duties between Cape Bolinao and San Fernando. On 9 December <b>excessive</b> air <b>leaks</b> developed, but she remained on patrol. On 10 December, the crew listened to radio traffic as the Japanese bombed Cavite. After the raid, the submarine's radio operator was unable to raise the station. On 12 December, S-36’s electrical steering failed. She was still unable to contact Cavite. Exhaust valve leaks appeared on 13 December, and, on 14 December, she received an urgent message requesting her position. None of her previous messages had gotten through. Two days later, she was ordered back to Mariveles, if able.|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine the N 1 value in the relationship between pressure and flow for different types of water reticulation pipes with different forms of fractures. The relationship is defined as: Once these N 1 values are established, they can be used as an indication for better pressure management in water reticulation networks. This investigation was limited to three types of pipe with diameter 110 mm and wall thickness of 4 mm: • uPVC • Cast iron • Steel And three different forms of failures: • Round holes • Longitudinal splits • Circular cracks Pressure step testing was used to obtain experimental data. During analysis of the data, Cd was calculated from the initial area of a fracture and kept constant thereafter. Conclusions could be drawn about similar type pipes with similar fractures and comparisons could be made between all the samples as well as previous studies. Generally it seems that longitudinal splits lead to the most <b>excessive</b> <b>leaking,</b> followed by round holes and then the circular cracks. A summary of typical N 1 exponents found is shown below: • uPVC pipes with round holes 0. 48 - 0. 49 • uPVC pipes with longitudinal splits 0. 89 - 1. 26 • uPVC pipes with circular cracks 0. 31 – 0. 48 • Cast Iron pipes with round holes 0. 43 – 0. 44 • Cast Iron pipes with longitudinal splits 0. 42 – 0. 46 • Cast Iron pipes with circular cracks 0. 41 – 0. 43 • Steel pipes with round holes 0. 42 – 0. 44 • Steel pipes with longitudinal splits 0. 39 – 0. 45 • Steel pipes with circular cracks 0. 38 – 0. 4...|$|R

40|$|Mechanically {{pumped fluid}} loops (MPFLs) are {{increasingly}} considered for spacecraft thermal control. A concern for long duration space missions is the leak of fluid leading to performance degradation or potential loop failure. An understanding of leak rate through analysis, {{as well as}} destructive and non-destructive testing, provides a verifiable means to quantify leak rates. The system can be appropriately designed to maintain safe operating pressures and temperatures throughout the mission. Two MPFLs on the Mars Science Laboratory Spacecraft, launched November 26, 2011, maintain the temperature of sensitive electronics and science instruments within a - 40 deg C to 50 deg C range during launch, cruise, and Mars surface operations. With over 100 meters of complex tubing, fittings, joints, flex lines, and pumps, the system must maintain a minimum pressure through all phases of the mission to provide appropriate performance. This paper describes the process of design, qualification, test, verification, and validation of the components and assemblies employed to minimize risks associated with <b>excessive</b> fluid <b>leaks</b> from pumped fluid loop systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of VENUS, a next generation superconducting Electron Cyclotron Resonance ion source designed {{to operate at}} 28 GHz, is complete. The cryostat including the superconducting magnet assembly was delivered in September 2001. During acceptance tests, the superconducting magnets produced an axial magnetic field strength of 4 T at injection, 3 T at extraction, and a radial field strength of 2 T at the plasma chamber wall without any quenches. These fields are sufficient for optimum operation at 28 GHz. The cryogenic system for VENUS {{has been designed to}} operate at 4. 2 K with two cryocoolers each providing up to 45 W of cooling at 50 K and 1. 5 W at 4 K in a closed loop mode without further helium transfers. However, during the acceptance tests an <b>excessive</b> heat <b>leak</b> of about 3 W was measured. In addition, the liquid helium heat exchanger did not work properly and had to be redesigned. The cryogenic system modifications will be described. In addition, an update on the installation of the ion source and its beam line components will be given...|$|R
40|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} {{in children}} is usually performed utilizing uncuffed endotracheal tubes for conduct of anesthesia {{as well as}} for prolonged ventilation in critical care units. However, uncuffed tubes may require multiple changes to avoid <b>excessive</b> air <b>leak,</b> with subsequent environmental pollution making the technique uneconomical. In addition, monitoring of ventilatory parameters, exhaled volumes, and end-expiratory gases may be unreliable. All these problems can be avoided by use of cuffed endotracheal tubes. Besides, cuffed endotracheal tubes may be of advantage in special situations like laparoscopic surgery and in surgical conditions at risk of aspiration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in children have found the narrowest portion of larynx at rima glottides. Cuffed endotracheal tubes, therefore, will form a complete seal with low cuff pressure of < 15 cm H 2 O without any increase in airway complications. Till recently, the use of cuffed endotracheal tubes was limited by variations in the tube design marketed by different manufacturers. The introduction of a new cuffed endotracheal tube in the market with improved tracheal sealing characteristics may encourage increased safe use of these tubes in clinical practice. A literature search using search words "cuffed endotracheal tube" and "children" from 1980 to January 2012 in PUBMED was conducted. Based on the search, the advantages and potential benefits of cuffed ETT are reviewed in this article...|$|R
40|$|There are two 850, 000 gallon Liquid Hydrogen (LH 2) storage spheres used {{to support}} the Space Shuttle Program; one {{residing}} at Launch Pad A and the other at Launch Pad B. The LH 2 Sphere at Pad B has had a high boiloff rate since being brought into service in the 1960 's. The daily commodity loss {{was estimated to be}} approximately double that of the Pad A sphere, and well above the minimum required by the sphere's specification. Additionally, after being re-painted in the late 1990 's a "cold spot" appeared on the outer sphere which resulted in a poor paint bond, and mold formation. Thermography was used to characterize the area, and the boiloff rate was continually evaluated. All evidence suggested that the high boiloff rate was caused by an <b>excessive</b> heat <b>leak</b> into the inner sphere due to an insulation void in the annulus. Pad B was recently taken out of Space Shuttle program service which provided a unique opportunity to diagnose the sphere's poor performance. The sphere was drained and inerted, and then opened from the annular relief device on the top where a series of boroscoping operations were accomplished. Boroscoping revealed a large Perlite insulation void in the region of the sphere where the cold spot was apparent. Perlite was then trucked in and off-loaded into the annular void region until the annulus was full. The sphere has not yet been brought back into service...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In some cases, {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax may require surgery, but in poor risk patients, pleurodesis {{may be a}} reasonable choice. Pleurodedis with autologous blood necessitates the clampage of the chest tube for a period. Excess air leakage from the chest tube may avoid the clampage. A simple technique without clamping the chest tube during pleurodesis is described which we used in patients with persistent air leak. Material and Method: The study comprised 11 patients diagnosed with {{spontaneous pneumothorax}} who were treated by autologous blood patch pleurodesis without clamping the chest tube. Pleurodesis was performed at the bedside by giving 50 ml autologous blood into the pleural cavity. The tube was lifted up to form a loop, {{in order to prevent}} the blood from draining into the bottle. Cessation of air leak at the end of 72 hours was accepted as complete response, whereas a marked decrease in air leakage was accepted as partial response to the procedure. Results: The mean age and age range of 10 male and 1 female patients were 55. 6 + 15. 7 and 29 - 75, consecutively. Complete response was obtained in 6 patients (% 54. 5), partial in 4 (% 36. 4). Air drainage continued without any change in 1 patient. Complications were empyema (1 patient) and intrathoracic coagulum (1 patient). Conclusion: The aforementioned loop technique facilitates the execution of autologous blood patch pleurodesis, particularly in patients with an <b>excessive</b> air <b>leak.</b> In our opinion, it is a reliable technique both for preventing air leakage and achieving pleurodesis in selective patients unsuitable for surgery...|$|R
40|$|A long life, single stage, reverse Brayton cycle {{cryogenic}} cooler {{is being}} developed for applications in space. The system {{is designed to provide}} 5 W of cooling at a temperature of 65 Kelvin with a total cycle input power of less than 200 watts. Key features of the approach include high speed, miniature turbomachines; an all metal, high performance, compact heat exchanger; and a simple, high frequency, three phase motor drive. In Phase 1, a preliminary design of the system was performed. Analyses and trade studies were used to establish the thermodynamic performance of the system and the performance specifications for individual components. Key mechanical features for components were defined and assembly layouts for the components and the system were prepared. Critical materials and processes were identified. Component and brassboard system level tests were conducted at cryogenic temperatures. The system met the cooling requirement of 5 W at 65 K. The system was also operated over a range of cooling loads from 0. 5 W at 37 K to 10 W at 65 K. Input power to the system was higher than target values. The heat exchanger and inverter met or exceeded their respective performance targets. The compresssor/motor assembly was marginally below its performance target. The turboexpander met its aerodynamic efficiency target, but overall performance was below target because of <b>excessive</b> heat <b>leak.</b> The heat leak will be reduced to an acceptable value in the engineering model. The results of Phase 1 indicate that the 200 watt input power requirement can be met with state-of-the-art technology in a system which has very flexible integration requirements and negligible vibration levels...|$|R
5000|$|By 1977, {{construction}} on the dam had reached an advanced stage where it could begin to impound its reservoir. While filling with water, cracks {{began to appear in}} the dam on its upstream heel when the reservoir level was 42 m below its maximum operating level of 1902 m above sea level. Uplift pressure on the dam had unexpectedly increased as well and engineers worried that the structure's grout curtain had been damaged. Because the dam is in a [...] "U"-shaped valley instead of the usual [...] "V"-shaped for arch dams, hydrostatic pressure is exceptionally strong on the center-bottom (heel) upstream portion of the dam. As <b>excessive</b> water <b>leaked</b> into lower areas of the dam, the water level was drawn down and engineers increased drainage. In 1979, the grout curtain was strengthened and another full impoundment was unsuccessfully attempted. Between 1980 and 1981, a polyurethane resin grout was used to re-grout joints and they were frozen during the next impoundment attempt, allowing them to thaw naturally. As remedial works progressed, cracks near the abutments (flanks) of the dam formed as well; on the downstream side and in a horizontal direction. A plastic sheet-covered concrete blanket was laid on the upstream valley floor behind the dam between 1981 and 1983. In the next few years, the sheets had to be repaired and the grout curtain re-grouted. In 1984, the reservoir was able reach 90 percent full. In 1979 and 1983, it had temporarily reached its maximum level as well but it could not be safely sustained. In 1984, the reservoir levels were limited to 15 - 20 m below maximum, and at those levels it was able to operate safely though at reduced capacities.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn 2013 new “mouthpiece ventilation” modes {{are being}} {{introduced}} to commercially available portable ventilators. Despite this, there is little {{knowledge of how to}} use noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIV) as opposed to bi-level positive airway pressure (PAP) and both have almost exclusively been reported to have been used via nasal or oro-nasal interfaces rather than via a simple mouthpiece. Non-invasive ventilation is often reported as failing because of airway secretion encumbrance, because of hypercapnia due to inadequate bi-level PAP settings, or poor interface tolerance. The latter can be caused by factors such as excessive pressure on the face from poor fit, <b>excessive</b> oral air <b>leak,</b> anxiety, claustrophobia, and patient-ventilator dys-synchrony. Thus, the interface plays a crucial role in tolerance and effectiveness. Interfaces that cover the nose and/or nose and mouth (oro-nasal) are the most commonly used but are more likely to cause skin breakdown and claustrophobia. Most associated drawbacks can be avoided by using mouthpiece NIV. Open-circuit mouthpiece NIV is being used by large populations in some centers for daytime ventilatory support and complements nocturnal NIV via “mask” interfaces for nocturnal ventilatory support. Mouthpiece NIV is also being used for sleep with the mouthpiece fixed in place by a lip-covering flange. Small 15 and 22 mm angled mouthpieces and straw-type mouthpieces are the most commonly used. NIV via mouthpiece is being used as an effective alternative to ventilatory support via tracheostomy tube (TMV) and is associated with a reduced risk of pneumonias and other respiratory complications. Its use facilitates “air-stacking” to improve cough, speech, and pulmonary compliance, all of which better maintain quality of life for patients with neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) than the invasive alternatives. Considering these benefits and the new availability of mouthpiece ventilator modes, wider knowledge of this technique is now warranted. This review highlights the indications, techniques, advantages and disadvantages of mouthpiece NIV...|$|R
40|$|Refining 155, 000 {{barrels of}} crude oil daily, a Louisiana plant markets oil {{products}} to gas stations in at least 26 states, including Washington, D. C. The plant uses 8, 538 steam traps with 1, 200 -, 600 -, 250 -, 75 -, 40 - and 15 -psi nominal pressures. Standardized with inverted bucket steam traps, the Louisiana refinery?s maintenance and energy coordinator was content with the results. The Spirax Sarco Inc (SSI) team demonstrated SSI?s Energy Service Group (ESG) capabilities and successes to the refinery manager, operations manager and production manager. From 2004 through 2006, the team presented a series of ESG seminars at the refinery site. The numerous models demonstrated quantitative savings with 3 - to 12 -mo paybacks. For a complete SSI turnkey program, for example, the SSI team presented an ROI with {{less than six months}} payback. The ESG survey found that only 3, 952 (46. 3 %) of the steam traps were operating correctly. The remaining steam traps experienced a variety of failures, including: 613 (7. 2 %) that failed open; 2, 763 (32. 4 %) were cold; 1, 012 (11. 9 %) that failed closed; 6 (0. 0 %) exhibited rapid cycling; and 192 (2. 2 %) were disconnected. The team also found performance and temperature issues with the HP sulfur reactors in the SRU units, largely due to the application of inverted bucket steam traps. Plus, as a result of <b>excessive</b> steam <b>leaks,</b> the sulfur reactors were creating a safety hazard. When these results were presented, management agreed that the sulfur reactors needed process improvement. The SSI team recommended replacing the inverted bucket steam traps with 1 - 1 / 2 -in. strainers and 1 - 1 / 2 -in. flanged float & thermostatic steam traps. They also suggested that the existing trap discharge piping should be removed and re-piped with globe-style bypass valves and gate-style isolation valves to reduce flow velocity. Once the SSI team began negotiations, it only took one survey for the Louisiana refinery to realize all the energy savings opportunities. In fact, the ESG survey uncovered more than $ 1. 3 million in steam losses through failed steam traps and another $ 1 million in steam leak opportunities and production, process, safety and environmental improvements. Impressed with the survey results, the refinery approved the estimated $ 110, 000 turnkey project, which offered a 5. 3 -month payback. Further negotiations netted the team annual steam trap surveys for the next three years, as well as an approved 2008 energy budget of $ 600, 000. Additionally, the Louisiana refinery has indicated that upon successful completion of the ESG program, SSI?s annual energy budget will increase to $ 1, 000, 000. ...|$|R

Thesis (PhD) [...] Macquarie University, Division of Environmental & Life Sciences, Dept. of Biological Sciences, 2005. Bibliography: p. 221 - 244. Introduction [...] Materials and methods [...] Isolation of the hex 1 gene from Trichoderma reesei and Ophiostoma floccosum [...] Expression of DsRed under the cbh 1 promoter and the hex 1 promoter with random integration [...] Modified expression vectors containing a fusion to {{a portion of}} hex 1 gene sequence [...] Expression of DsRed from the hex 1 locus and the phenotypic characteristics of a hex 1 deletion mutant [...] Summary and concluding discussion. For Trichoderma reesei to be developed as an effiecient producer of a large variety of proteins, the expression system requires diversification. In particular, the choice of promoters available needs to be broadened to include promoters which are active in conditions other than those conducive to induction of cellulase expression. Using proteomics, the HEX 1 protein was identified as an abundant protein of the cell envelope of T. reesei when grown {{on a range of}} carbon sources, suggesting that a strong constitutive promoter drives the expression of this physiologically important protein. This thesis is an exploration into the hex 1 gene promoter and the role of hex 1 in the maintenance of mycelium integrity in T. reesei with consideration for the application of this gene in the further development of filamentous fungi as protein expression systems. [...] The single copy hex 1 gene and flanking regions were isolated from T. reesei and another biotechnologically important fungus, Ophiostoma floccosum. The fluorescent reporter protein DsRed 1 -E 5 was expressed under the T. reesei hex 1 promoter and promoter activity was monitored by fluorescence CLSM and RNA analysis. During the rapid growth phase of a culture, the hex 1 promoter was active in a range of carbon sources and three transcipt types with alternative tsp and splicing sites were discovered for the hex 1 gene. The distribution of fluorescence throughout the mycelium suggested spatial regulation of the hex 1 promoter as well as temporal regulation. The promoter was continually active {{in the absence of a}} functional hex 1 gene product suggesting that the hex 1 promoter is regulated in part, by negative feedback from the endogenous gene product. Interruption of the hex 1 gene produced hyphae that <b>leaked</b> <b>excessive</b> volumes of cytoplasm when physically damaged which may be advantageous for the externalisation of selected protein products. The results indicate that the regulation of the hex 1 hene promoter is complex and that the hex 1 gene is integral to the maintenance of the integrity of the fungal mycelium.
