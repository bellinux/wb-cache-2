5|$|Bok began {{a ten-year}} period of slavery {{at the hands}} of Giemma and his son Hamid. He was forced to tend the family's herds of livestock. He had to take them to {{pastures}} in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect that his life was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> forever and that his father {{was not going to be}} able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E
25|$|When {{his form}} slumped in 2006, Sreesanth {{had tried to}} change his luck by {{changing}} his name to Sreesunth, on numerological advice. He later stated {{that he was not}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the name due to sentimental reasons. The word 'santh' in his name is derived from his father's name Santhakumaran Nair.|$|E
25|$|Private or not, UT and Texas A {{were dead}} set against {{replacing}} Arkansas. The NCAA sanctions and Arkansas' departure made the conference appear broken to fans in Texas. Texas and Texas A's leaderships felt {{the conference was}} inherently flawed, with too many mouths to feed off too few TVs. Adding a single school was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> that dynamic, it would only create the public perception of a healed conference and prolong UT and Texas A's suffering.|$|E

50|$|The books's primary content {{involved}} politics {{related to}} school financing, including expenditures and taxation, with less emphasis <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in curriculum. Mirel {{argued that the}} social classes and races need {{to come together and}} cooperate so that the Detroit school system can be properly funded and maintain its academic standards; the author makes this view known in the epilogue. The second edition has a new epilogue that covers the late 1980s and the 1990s.|$|R

25|$|Chuck's {{philosophy}} was to convince every {{guy on the}} team that his role was important. If you came in {{as a free agent}} and were just a gunner on the punt team or the third safety, you were doing something the team needed to win...It was his way of emphasizing that no one is irreplaceable. You have to coach everybody the same way. If Joe Greene goes out, Steve Furness goes in and we're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> anything. Chuck never panicked when someone got hurt or held out. We can still function. That made a big impression on me.|$|E

If you're not, this video isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> your opinion on the music." [...] Patrizio criticized the video's direction, observing that [...] "the camerawork is full of fast, MTV-style cuts, which, combined with the flashing lights, is more headache-inducing than the music." ...|$|E
500|$|FFA chief {{executive}} Ben Buckley {{said that this}} signing will be crucial {{for the growth of}} Australian Football, both economically and technically. Ian Crook, manager of Sydney FC, said he would build the forward set-up around the Italian, who would be given [...] "licence" [...] to pull the strings. [...] "We're not going to reinvent the wheel here. He's played 19 years for one of the biggest four or five clubs in the world, as a No. 10 or a No. 9. We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> that." [...] FIFA President Sepp Blatter sent his best wishes to Del Piero and his new club.|$|E

500|$|Mills {{sets his}} teams {{out to play}} a passing game, and affirmed this when stating: [...] "My {{philosophy}} is to play football with {{the ball on the}} deck, to play attacking football, to be disciplined with and without the ball". He prefers to employ a 4–3–3 formation, explaining it allows his teams to play entertaining football and makes them hard to beat, and it brought him success when at Tamworth and York. He has stuck with this formation despite charges from some of being tactically stubborn, saying: [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the way my teams play, the systems. I've not even had a thought about that".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the success}} of the game, the Miller {{brothers}} eventually pursued other projects. Robyn Miller said: [...] "I {{think it would be a}} detriment to always, for the rest of our lives, be creating Myst-like projects. [...] We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> evolve and grow, just like any person does in any manner." [...] Robyn would leave Cyan to form a new development company called Land of Point; Vander Wende would also leave to pursue other projects. The next video game entry in the Myst franchise would be 2001's , which was not developed by Cyan nor published by Brøderbund. Presto Studios took over development; Ubisoft acquired Brøderbund's entertainment library from The Learning Company and published the Myst sequels.|$|E
500|$|He started {{alongside}} Hall of Fame center Dave Cowens, {{who enjoyed}} playing with Washington, remarking, [...] "It's great fun, {{you can always}} hear him grunt when he's rebounding." [...] Auerbach said, [...] "Kermit was fighting a battle he couldn't win. Nothing he could say or do was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the way people perceived him because of that moment. I wanted him to feel at home with us, to feel wanted." [...] Washington won Boston fans over immediately. His acceptance was aided by a glowing article Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him. After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the Denver Nuggets.|$|E

[...] He described it that [...] "It's like erosion: a very slow process. As time goes on, you need to bring him to different places and more places, the more stories and scripts you do." [...] Contrasting first-season episodes to those of the seventh season, Kenny said that [...] "there's a bit of a change , but I don't think it's that extreme at all." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Braves {{selected}} Ernie DiGregorio in the 1973 NBA {{draft to}} complement 1972 NBA draft selection Bob McAdoo, {{it was clear}} the team was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> to fast-paced offense to leverage DiGregorio's skills. [...] Hummer {{was more of a}} defensive player. [...] Prior to the 1973–74 NBA season, Hummer was packaged with a 1974 NBA draft 2nd round pick and a 1975 NBA draft 2nd round pick in a trade that sent him to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for Gar Heard and Kevin Kunnert. [...] The deal was part of the resume that earned Donavan the NBA Executive of the Year Award. That season the 54–28 Dick Motta-coached 1973–74 Bulls team that he was traded to initially would make the playoffs, but the 36–46 Bill Russell-coached 1973–74 SuperSonics that he would finish the season with would not.|$|E
500|$|The {{other three}} episodes {{of the season}} did not match the viewership of [...] "Bop Gun", but they were {{nevertheless}} considered strong ratings for the show, better than past Homicide episodes and the average rating for L.A. Law. Homicides improved ratings in the Thursday night timeslot fueled speculation that L.A. Law might be canceled and Homicide would take its place. Warren Littlefield denied such claims, believing the success of one series did not necessarily have to mean the cancellation of the other. Despite Homicides improvement in the ratings, NBC did not immediately commit to a third season until the producers agreed to even more changes, including more prominent guest stars, more women in the cast and more life-affirming storylines. Outgoing cast member Polito publicly decried these changes, claiming the show was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> from a drama into a [...] "soap opera".|$|E

500|$|During the 1990s {{specialties}} {{for communicating}} to certain audiences and within certain market segments emerged, such as investor relations or technology PR. New internet technology and social media websites effected PR strategies and tactics. In April 1999, four managers from IBM, Sun Microsystems, National Public Radio and Linux Journal created [...] "The Cluetrain Manifesto." [...] The Manifesto established 95 theses {{about the way}} social media and internet technologies were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> business. It concluded that markets had become [...] "smarter and faster than most companies," [...] because stakeholders were getting information from each other. The Manifesto [...] "created a storm" [...] with strong detractors and supporters. That same year, Seth Godin published a book on permission marketing, which advocated against advertising and in favor of marketing that is useful and educational. While initially controversial, by 2006 it became commonly accepted that social media had {{an important role in}} public relations.|$|E
500|$|During the 2000–01 season, Richmond {{finished}} {{the regular season}} with a 21–6 record, finishing first in the CAA with a 12–4 record. The Spiders won ten of their final eleven games. [...] However, since Richmond was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> its athletic affiliation from the CAA to the Atlantic 10 the following season, it was ineligible for the 2001 CAA conference tournament. Only one team from the CAA had ever earned an at large bid to the NCAA tournament. [...] The Spiders wound up playing in the 2001 NIT, where they defeated West Virginia before losing to Dayton. [...] With one win and one loss Beilein stayed at [...]500 in the NIT, at 4–4. At {{the end of the}} season, Beilein declined an offer to coach at Rutgers. The victory over West Virginia is credited with being a large part of why Beilein was eventually hired at West Virginia.|$|E

500|$|U.S. Soccer {{was criticized}} after the {{match for the}} secretive bid process that allows teams to outspend their opponents for hosting rights. [...] Both the blind bidding process for hosting tournament matches {{and the manner in}} which MLS teams {{qualified}} for the tournament were widely criticized. [...] An example of the concerns raised around hosting came from FC Dallas midfielder Daniel Hernandez on Twitter, where he complained about Seattle's home-field advantage throughout the 2011 tournament. [...] Following the final, MLS and U.S. Soccer officials met to discuss rule changes to the tournament's host bidding system and team qualification processes. [...] Sounders FC owner Adrian Hanauer commented on the changes and the possibility of raising the profile of the tournament, [...] "I don’t think the bidding process is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the profile of the tournament, necessarily.
