Finally he stated that this was the reason why ancients prefer qian huang (铅黄 or literally ‘lead yellow’) for painting over error. In the context, one would assume that this meant a lead white and orpiment mixture, but massicot is also commonly referred to as qian huang.|$|E

To {{improve the}} {{dispersion}} of phthalocyanine blue powder, decrease its consumption {{and increase the}} use value of talc, TPBCP (Talc/Phthalocyanine Blue Composite Powder) was prepared by liquid phase mechanochemical method. By means of paint performance test, scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, the properties and microstructure of com-posite powder were characterized. The <b>hiding</b> <b>power</b> and oil absorption value of TPBCP were 12. 88 g/m 2 and 32. 50 g/ 100 g respectively, and the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) colorimetric data L, a, and b were 44. 95, 1. 65 and- 17. 18 respectively. It was equivalent for the <b>hiding</b> <b>power</b> of composite powder to 77. 6 % of that of pure phthalocyanine blue with an equivalent CIE. The formation of TPBCP was marked by phthalocyanine blue particles uniformly coated on talc surface.

30|$|Although MA-XRF {{scanning}} is not depth-selective, {{it appeared}} to be highly suitable to study the complex layer sequencing that is typical for seventeenth century still life paintings. The ground rule was to start off with an underpainting, blocking out each figure in its own basic color, using pigments with strong <b>hiding</b> <b>power</b> and/or tinting strength and then gradually building up the tonality and form by applying local passages of transparent pigments in the upper paint layers. This particular system, in fact, favored characterizing the build-up of the paint layers with MA-XRF scanning. Pigments with more body, such as vermilion (HgS), lead white (PbCO 3 ·Pb(OH) 2) and umber (Fe 2 O 3 ·(H 2 O) + MnO 2) were often found in the ground, underpainting, or as small highlights in the upper layers. Those pigments are composed of elements with a high atomic number, and are consequently easier to detect with MA-XRF scanning and less influenced by attenuation. In addition, the superimposed layers are projected as a shadow on top of the fluorescence emission from subjacent layers. Therefore, the degree of attenuation and blocked fluorescence emission of the elements gave an insight in the layered sequence. In return, pigments with a smaller body and little <b>hiding</b> <b>power,</b> such as ultramarine and lakes, are composed of elements with a low atomic number and are highly influenced by attenuation and blocking by other elements. Since they are usually found in upper layers of the strata, the fluorescence emission of the elements is either not or to a lesser degree attenuated. Moreover, color information from the paint surface can ameliorate the ability to distinguish pigments with the same element composition.|$|E
40|$|TiO 2 -coated illite {{composite}} pigments {{were prepared}} by hydrolyzing Ti(SO 4) (2) {{on the surface}} of illite substrates and the products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), zeta potential analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. Density functional theory calculations of the energetic stability and electronic structure of illite, calcined illite, and TiO 2 -coated illite were used to analyze the chemical activity and bonding position between the anatase film and the illite particles. The results demonstrate that calcined illite is more suitable for metatitanic acid coating. Moreover, the surface of illite substrates is continuously coated with anatase and a chemical interaction could occur between the anatase film and the illite substrates.

40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, {{differential}} power-analysis (DPA) {{attacks are}} {{a serious threat}} for cryptographic systems due to the inherent existence of data-dependent power consumption. <b>Hiding</b> <b>power</b> consumption of encryption circuit or applying key-blinded tech-niques can increase the security against DPA attacks, but they result in a large overhead for hardware cost, execution time, and energy dissipation. In this brief, a new DPA countermea-sure performing all field operations in a randomized Montgomery domain is proposed to eliminate the correlation between target and reference power traces. After implemented in 90 -nm CMOS process, our protected 521 -bit dual-field elliptic curve (EC) cryp-tographic processor can perform one EC scalar multiplication in 8. 08 ms over GF (p 521) and 4. 65 ms over GF (2409), re-spectively, with 4. 3 % area and 5. 2 % power overhead. Experi-ments from a field-programmable gate array evaluation board demonstrate that the private key of unprotected device will be revealed within 103 power traces, whereas the same attacks on our proposal cannot successfully extract the key value even after 106 measurements.
