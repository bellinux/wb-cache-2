50|$|Alternatively, a {{grapple fork}} {{may be used}} to lift and {{transport}} large round bales. The grapple fork is a hydraulically driven implement attached {{to the end of a}} tractor's bucket loader. When the hydraulic cylinder is extended, the fork clamps downward toward the bucket, much like a closing hand. To move a large round bale, the tractor approaches the bale from the side and places the bucket underneath the bale. The fork is then clamped down across the top of the bale, and the bucket is lifted with the bale in tow. <b>Grab</b> <b>hooks</b> installed on the bucket of a tractor are another tool used to handle round bales, and be done by a farmer with welding skills by welding two hooks and a heavy chain to the outside top of a tractor front loader bucket.|$|R
50|$|Inside the supermarket, the {{remaining}} group make {{a plan to}} catch their shark so they can swim to safety. Jaime manages to swim to the butcher section and <b>grab</b> a <b>hook</b> with meat to use as bait. The shark does not go for the bait, so fellow survivor, Kirby (Dan Wyllie) <b>grabs</b> a <b>hook</b> and puts it through Naomi's shirt, using her as bait. Kirby is revealed to be Doyle's partner, who changed out of his clothes and mask so the others wouldn't know he was the murderer. Doyle stabs Kirby with a makeshift harpoon, and throws him into the water with the hook. Naomi is pulled from the water as the shark devours Kirby, catching its jaw on the hook and ensnaring itself in the trap. Josh apologizes to Tina, feeling guilt over her brother's death, but Tina reassures him and kisses him.|$|R

50|$|While crochet braids are {{a hybrid}} of {{traditional}} braids, they're considered to be more similar to weaves. The natural hair can be twisted or braided, but is most commonly styled into cornrows before affixing the synthetic hair. Using a latch hook or crochet hook, the synthetic hair (in the form of loose bulk) is then attached. Parts of the hair extensions are <b>grabbed</b> by the <b>hook</b> and pulled through the underside of each cornrow, working {{from the front of}} the hair to the back at a 90 degree angle.|$|R
5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by clamping the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a <b>hook,</b> <b>grabs</b> the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|R
5000|$|On any {{song that}} we're writing, {{the first thing}} I think is, [...] "Where's the chorus? What's the chorus? Where's the hook?" [...] Then we've got {{something}} to build around.

To me, the chorus {{has to be the}} thing that <b>grabs</b> me and <b>hooks</b> me in - especially in death metal, because there's no vocal melody. Yeah, you've got riffs, {{but you have to have}} something to hook the listener in, to bring them back, to keep them listening again and again and again. That's really the goal, to create music that I would want to listen to five years later. For me, it's all about choruses and trying to write catchy songs.|$|R
50|$|The work is {{begun with}} the {{traditional}} starting chain, a series of slip stitches. Once the chain is completed, the first row is worked by inserting the hook back into the previous link of the chain, and a loop from the free end of the yarn is <b>grabbed</b> with the <b>hook</b> and pulled back through the link. Unlike traditional crochet, however, this new loop is not then pulled through the initial loop. Both remain on the hook and then the process is repeated, working from right to left, until each link in the chain has been worked. At the end, there will be as many loops on the hook as there are stitches required. This process is called casting on. This {{is the first of}} two parts for creating a row.|$|R

2500|$|In 2007 and 2008, Oscar Dyson took {{scientists}} to the Bering Sea {{so that they}} could capture seals on the ice there and attach satellite tags to them with which to collect movement and behavior data. To expand NOAA's ability to monitor ribbon, bearded, spotted, and ringed seals, whose broad range and remoteness from shore make surveying them using manned helicopters challenging, NOAA conducted tests of the ScanEagle unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aboard Oscar Dyson in October 2008. On 15 and 16 October 2008, scientists and technicians aboard Oscar Dyson conducted three successful test flights of the ScanEagle over Puget Sound, Washington, launching it from a pneumatic catapult attached to the top of her bridge, flying it by remote control from Oscar Dyson, and recovering it with a [...] "skyhook" [...] system [...] a vertical line deployed over Oscar Dysons starboard side between a winch and a boom [...] that the Scaneagle could <b>grab</b> with <b>hooks</b> on its wingtips as it returned to the ship. As a United States Coast Guard officer aboard Oscar Dyson to study the feasibility of using the ScanEagle for search and rescue missions looked on, Oscar Dysons bridge personnel and the embarked UAV pilots cooperated closely to ensure that the ships speed and heading facilitated the launch and recovery of the aircraft. The test demonstrated the feasibility of using UAVs to assess the abundance and distribution of seals, which began in the spring of 2009.|$|R
5000|$|The camera ran on {{a ceiling}} {{track in the}} hotel room and when it came outside the window, was meant to be picked up by a hook {{suspended}} from a giant crane nearly 30 metres high. A system of gyroscopes was fitted on the camera to steady it during the switch from this smooth indoor track to the crane outside. Meanwhile, the bars on the window had been given hinges. When the camera reached the window and the bars were no longer in the field of view, they were swung away to either side. At this time the camera's forward movement had to stop for a few seconds as the crane's <b>hook</b> <b>grabbed</b> it and took over from the track. To hide this, the lens was slowly and smoothly zoomed until the crane could pull the camera forward. Antonioni directed the scene from a van by means of monitors and microphones, talking to assistants who communicated his instructions to the actors and operators.|$|R
50|$|The Swamp from Hell was an {{occasional}} stand-in for the Worminator. One player started outside the house, jumping on a trampoline {{in an effort}} to <b>grab</b> skulls off <b>hooks</b> for 15 seconds. Each skull snatched meant that one bag of skulls was placed on a platform by a CGI lava pit. On {{the other side of the}} lava pit was another platform, and the two were bridged by a balance beam. Once the player stepped on a platform, they had 60 seconds to transport as many of the bags of skulls to the other platform as possible, earning five points for each one (the player could make as many trips as needed). Falling off the balance beam at any point would vaporize the player, ending the round (though the team still kept the points). In addition, as the 60-second time limit counted down, a cage containing the player's teammate lowered towards the lava pit. If time ran out before all of the bags were across, the teammate in the cage would reach the lava pit and be vaporized.|$|R

By the standards of the Weiland of old, Blaster falls softly short; its best flavors come from the handful of new touches." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said, [...] "With such a familiar palette, details matter and the aptly titled Blaster lacks in subtlety. Much of it churns at crackling digital overdrive, sounding brutal, loud, and ugly, but beneath that gnarled surface Weiland can still deliver the kind of candied hooks that keep him firmly situated as a guilty pleasure.

40|$|Abstract Background Bursting {{strength}} {{is a standard}} method for evaluating mosquito net strength. This article suggests that tension strength with one <b>grab</b> and one <b>hook</b> better represent how holes are generated in bed nets in real life. Methods Measurements of bursting strength and tension strengths in the two directions are analysed for eight model nets created for the study. The nets {{were made in the}} most commonly used denier (75 and 100 D) and mesh (156 holes/inch 2) for multifilament polyester yarns, texturized or not, and with 4 or 6 sided holes. All were made from one polyester quality. Data was arranged in a randomized, complete block design and analysed for significant variables and their interactions. Data was then subjected to regression analyses using net square metre weight as a weighting factor with stepwise removal of variables. This revealed how the four textile variables interacted and allowed for making predictions for the strength of commercial nets in polyester or polyethylene. Results For the model nets, higher denier provided higher bursting strength and tension strengths, texturizing weakened nets and four-sided holes were stronger than six-sided holes. Even when compensating for square metre weight, 100 D nets are stronger than 75 D nets. Results for the commercial polyester net nets are less clear, probably because of different qualities of polyester. Tensile strength: a 75 denier net knitted tightly to provide the same square metre weight as a standard 100 denier net therefore does not obtain the same strength. Polyethylene nets are made of mono-fibre yarns and, therefore, have higher tension strength in both directions than multifilament polyester nets. For bursting strength results overlap for 100 denier yarns of both yarn types. As a class, commercial polyethylene nets are stronger than commercial polyester net whatever method is used for evaluation. Conclusion Tension strength measured in the length and width directions of the net using one hook and one clamp provide new relevant data as this method more closely imitates the cause of tear holes in nets as they occur in real life use. Using this methodology, the commercial monofilament yarn polyethylene nets are significantly stronger than the commercial multifilament polyester nets. This test method should be applied for nets used for years in the field. </p...|$|R
5000|$|While {{recording}} Music Box, Carey {{began to}} alter her songwriting style and genre choices, {{most notably in}} [...] "Dreamlover". The song is different from anything she had recorded on her previous album, as it leans on pop and light R&B influences. While searching for new record producers for the album, Carey came across Dave Hall, a New York native who was known from his work on Mary J. Blige's debut album, What's the 411? (1992). Carey wanted to incorporate a sampled loop from an older song into [...] "Dreamlover", her second song to do so. The pair reviewed several older tunes and melodies, and chose [...] "Blind Alley", performed by The Emotions in 1972. This song had previously been sampled in Big Daddy Kane's [...] "Ain't No Half-Steppin'", which led Mariah to use the sample for Dreamlover. In an interview with Fred Bronson, Carey described working with Hall:"I {{wanted to do something}} that had a happy feeling, something that was more open and released, and that's really not Dave. It's very anti what he's about. So he said, 'Oh, {{you want to do that}} happy stuff? All right, all right.' He was not into doing it. Then we started listening to a lot of different and old loops and we used the 'Blind Alley' loop and I started singing the melody over it."Although Carey had heard the hook used in several other songs over the years, she felt her use of the sample was done in a more innovative way. [...] "We built the song from there and I wrote the lyrics and the melody and Dave ended up liking it," [...] she continued. After having completed the song, Hall complimented Carey's work ethic and form of writing, calling her a [...] "perfectionist" [...] and [...] "very professional." [...] He explained that they incorporated the hook, a melody, and the sample into the song over the course of one night. The song's title was not added until the end of production. Hall said Carey works in a unique fashion, usually developing the song's instrumentals and hook prior to the lyrics and title. Carey describes the songwriting process:"The way I usually work is I do an untitled song. We'll <b>grab</b> the <b>hook,</b> whether sampled or created, and use it as the working title. I wrote the verses first, as well as the melody and the inclusion of several instrumentals. Sometimes I'll have an idea for a lyrics. If I'm collaborating with someone, I'll direct them in the direction that I'm going chord wise, because I get all these melody ideas and then I lose them if I don't have someone really good with the keyboard with me. That's why I tend to collaborate because I lose the ideas by the time I figure out the chord. All these melody ideas just go."When Carey's fiancé at the time, Tommy Mottola, came to hear the song in the studio, he had mixed feelings. He approached Walter Afanasieff and asked him to add some additional instrumentation and flavor. Afanasieff changed the song at the production level, altering the way in which the hook sample was incorporated into the song, as well as adding several new instruments. He described the changes to Bronson in an interview:"Mariah and Dave did this loop thing which was new to us pop producers at the time. Their version of 'Dreamlover' was missing a lot of stuff. The spirit of the song was up but it wasn't hitting hard enough. I re-worked the drums, organ and keyboard. The organ and hi-hat part I changed made it a bit more swinging and a little bit more driving. I put a whole new shade of colors to it." ...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{participants}} of the outdoor recreation folk group, {{or people who}} participate regularly in human-powered outdoor recreation as a lifestyle, personal narratives are an integral and integrated part of interaction. This group is particularly rife with stories, because in {{the natural order of}} their lifestyle they regularly engage in activities filled with adventure and challenge. As members of this folk group engage in recreation together they share their personal narratives because it is the common tie between them, not only in interest, but in current participation and thus natural conversation. This common and simple tie sets the stage perfectly for the sharing of personal experiences, but more than that, within this folk group, the stories serve other crucial functions that {{play a role in the}} perpetuation of group dynamics, community development, community involvement, and social sorting within the group. This thesis discusses the findings of an analysis of 15 personal narratives, collected in natural context, and determined to play the primary roles of establishing or maintaining face, social sorting, and community building. I find myself at the top of a zip-line at the Olympic Park in Park City, Utah, waiting with a friend and my son for our race to the bottom of the mountain. I’m teasing my son about the fact that his excuse for losing the last zip-line race is that a “branch hit him” during the first phase of the race and slowed him down. My friend J. G. begins to tell a story, and because I have my phone with me I record his narrative. J. G. : Well speaking of branches, I was in Maui and we were mountain biking, actually we were on the island of Molaki, it’s on the desert side and we were descending down to the ocean. So, you’d be in these big areas that you just kind of roll over, and it was kind of single track that would weave through these meadows. And my buddy stopped and goes “Oh, I gotta remind you of something. Don’t…don’t run into those bushes. He said, you’re gonna see these bushes, they don’t look harmful, but they are really going to hurt. And I’m goin and I see one that looks really painful and I’m like, “Oh, I’m going to avoid that. ” and then I run into the one doesn’t look painful. L. J. And it was? J. G. : And it was like this shhhh, it literally <b>grabbed</b> me like <b>hooks</b> and shredded my arm. L. J. Really? J. G. : And I remember, I pull up and my buddy stops and he goes, “Oh, you got it, didn’t Yeah ?” And I was literally bleeding. And I still have scars, here and here (points to arm) just two lines that go like this (shows how long the cuts were). Because it just went shhhh. And it just … L. J. How did it do that? J. G. : It was just like……but it’s funny, because if you bumped into it, it wouldn’t do anything, but because you’re moving it grabs you. It was just like shhhh. L. J. What kind of plant was it? J.
