We {{demonstrate}} that the sand record from Silver Lake plotted as percent weight is in-phase with the <b>elevation</b> <b>curve</b> of Lake Michigan since the mid-Holocene Nipissing Phase. Because fluctuations in Lake Michigan's lake level are recorded in beach ridges, and are a response to climate change, the aeolian sand record within Silver Lake is also a proxy for climate change. It appears that increases in dune activity and lake sand are controlled by similar climatic shifts that drive fluctuations in lake level of Lake Michigan. High lake levels destabilize coastal bluffs that drive dune sand instability, and along with greater wintertime storminess, increase niveo-aeolian transport of sand across lake ice. The sand is introduced into the lake each spring as the ice cover melts...|$|E
40|$|Pocatello Valley {{in southeastern}} Idaho and {{northern}} Utah is a structural and topographic basin bounded {{on all sides}} by mountains composed of Paleozoic platform carbonates and elastics. In the late Pleistocene it contained pluvial Lake Utaho, which, prior to 1981, was considered {{to have been an}} arm of Lake Bonneville. This study corroborates the finding of Currey (1981) that the two lakes were separate. The Quaternary deposits examined in this study are divided into two broad groups: those that were deposited prior to the last pluvial lake cycle, and those that were deposited during and after the pluvial lake maximum, (since approximately 16 ka) when the area was occupied by Lake Utaho and Lake Bonneville. Pediment gravels, alluvial fans, piedmont colluvium, and talus comprise the older group: the younger deposits include stream channel deposits, lacustrine sediments, and loess. Quantitative front sinuosity height ratios) geomorphological techniques (mountain ratios and valley floor width-valley indicate that the bounding ranges on the east and west margins of Pocatello Valley are slightly to moderately active tectonically. Precise surveying of the Lake Utaho highstand shoreline revealed significant deviations from the smooth, isostatically rebounded shoreline <b>elevation</b> <b>curve</b> of Crittenden (1963). The greatest deflections occur where the sinuous shoreline crosses the more linear inferred range front faults at the base of Samaria Mountain, on the east margin of the valley. The deflections (as much as 6. 4 m over a horizontal distance of 900 m) suggest that movement has occurred along the range front faults since the shorelines were created approximately 16 ka, but no fault scarps were formed. A buried colluvium estimated to be 95 ka + 15 ka that was exposed draped toward in a over the trench at the range the inferred fault, valley. There are front is monoclinally and dips as much as 49 ° no fractures in the colluvium, which suggests that, although relative movement between the mountain and valley blocks has occurred, the displacement has only warped the colluvium. This further suggests that any earthquakes accompanying the movements must have been below the magnitude threshold (ML 6. 2 - 6. 3) necessary for surface rupture...|$|E

40|$|Accepted for Publication) ABSTRACT: The {{manifold}} of a {{planar array}} {{in a direction}} finding system may be considered as two families of azimuth and <b>elevation</b> <b>curves,</b> where the-parameter curves are hyperhelical as well as geodesic while the-parameter curves are neither. Since the-curves are not hyperhelical, their curvatures depend on and so analytical evaluation of curvatures of order greater than two can become exceedingly laborious and impractical. The advantages of having hyperhelical parameter curves are numerous. For one thing, all the curvatures of a hyperhelix may be evaluated recursively since they do not vary from point to point {{as a function of}} lower-order curvatures. This has been demonstrated in [1] for the case of the singleparameter manifold of a linear array. Furthermore the convenient nature of a hyperhelix's geometry has proven invaluable in array design [2], in investigating the detection and resolution thresholds [3] and in identifying ambiguities inherent in array configurations [4]. In view of the above facts, it seems logical that an alternative parametrization of the manifold surface, which results in two sets of hyperhelical parameter curves, can provide a great deal of additional insight into the nature of planar array behaviour and design. In this investigation, such a parametrization is identified and its significance is demonstrated by a number of examples/applications. Furthermore properties, such as Gaussian and geodesic curvatures, are defined and their implications with regards to isometric mappings are discussed...|$|R

The tube is supported at the mirror end by a [...] "universal joint", a hinge with two axes, which allows the tube to be inclined through a large range of altitude and also to be turned through a limited range of azimuth. The azimuth range is limited to about one hour by the supporting walls that flank the tube on its eastern and western sides. The walls are 23 ft (7 m) apart, 40 ft (12 m) high, and 71 ft (21.5 m) long. A chain and counterweight keeps the telescope in balance, another chain with a winch controls the altitude.

The basic analysis tool is a Physical Optics reflector analysis code that was ported to a parallel computer for faster execution times. There are several steps involved in computing the RF {{performance of the}} various systems. 1. A model of the RF distortions of the main reflector is required. This model is based upon measured holography maps of the 70 -meter antenna obtained at 3 elevation angles. The holography maps are then processed (using an appropriate gravity mechanical model of the dish) to provide surface distortion maps at all elevation angles. 2. From the surface distortion maps, ray optics is {{used to determine the}} theoretical shape of the DFP that will exactly phase compensate the distortions. 3. From the theoretical shape and a NASTRAN mechanical model of the plate, the actuator positions that generate a surface that provides the best RMS fit to the theoretical model are selected. Using the actuator positions and the NASTRAN model provides an accurate description of the actual mirror shape. 4. Starting from the mechanical drawings of the feed, a computed RF feed pattern is generated. This pattern is expanded into a set of spherical wave modes so that a complete near field analysis of the reflector system can be obtained. 5. For the array feed, the excitation coefficients that provide the maximum gain are computed using a phase conjugate technique. The basic experimental geometry consisted of a dual shaped 70 -meter antenna system; a refocusing ellipse, a DFP and an array feed system. To provide physical insight to the systems performance, focal plane field plots are presented at several <b>elevations.</b> <b>Curves</b> of predicted performance are shown for the DFP system, monopulse tracking system, AFCS and combined DFP/AFCS system.
