5|$|Pleuronectiformes (<b>flatfish)</b> are {{an order}} of ray-finned fish. The most obvious {{characteristic}} of the modern <b>flatfish</b> is their asymmetry, with both eyes {{on the same side}} of the head in the adult fish. In some families the eyes are always on the right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed <b>flatfish)</b> and in others they are always on the left (sinistral or left-eyed <b>flatfish).</b> The primitive spiny turbots include equal numbers of right- and left-eyed individuals, and are generally less asymmetrical than the other families. Other distinguishing features of the order are the presence of protrusible eyes, another adaptation to living on the seabed (benthos), and the extension of the dorsal fin onto the head.|$|E
5|$|Animals such as chameleon, frog, <b>flatfish</b> such as {{the peacock}} flounder, squid and octopus {{actively}} change their skin patterns and colours using special chromatophore cells to resemble their current background, or, as in most chameleons, for signalling. However, Smith's dwarf chameleon does use active colour change for camouflage.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of the caudal endoskeleton of the turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.) is described and compared to the setting-up of the caudal endoskeleton in other <b>flatfishes.</b> In the turbot, caudal bony elements develop very early, before the eye migration. The same pattern occurs in the <b>flatfishes</b> of the bothoid group, while in the Soleidae the supporting caudal fin elements develop once the eye has migrated. This discrepancy is discussed; it points out that more work on the ontogeny of <b>flatfishes</b> is needed...|$|R

5|$|<b>Flatfish</b> are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show {{a greater degree}} of asymmetry than any other vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis during the course of their development, with one eye migrating {{to the other side of}} the head, and they simultaneously start swimming on their side. This has the advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view. The upper side is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the leopard}} shark {{consists}} of small benthic and littoral animals, most significantly crabs (Cancridae, Grapsidae, and Hippoidea), shrimp, bony fish (including anchovies, herring, topsmelt, croakers, surfperch, gobies, rockfish, sculpins, <b>flatfish,</b> and midshipmen), fish eggs, clams, and the echiurid fat innkeeper worm (Urechis caupo). This opportunistic hunter {{has also been}} known to eat ghost shrimp, polychaete worms, and the young of smoothhounds, shovelnose guitarfish (Rhinobatos productus), and bat rays (Myliobatis californicus). Eelgrass (Zostera) and algae may be swallowed incidentally.|$|E
5|$|The {{porbeagle}} is {{an active}} predator that predominantly ingests small to medium-sized bony fishes. It chases down pelagic fishes such as lancet fish, mackerel, pilchards, herring, and sauries, and forages near the bottom for groundfishes such as cod, hake, icefish, dories, sand lances, lumpsuckers, and <b>flatfish.</b> Cephalopods, particularly squid, also form {{an important component of}} its diet, while smaller sharks such as spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and tope sharks (Galeorhinus galeus) are rarely taken. Examinations of porbeagle stomach contents have also found small shelled molluscs, crustaceans, echinoderms, and other invertebrates, which were likely ingested incidentally, as well as inedible debris such as small stones, feathers, and garbage fragments.|$|E
5000|$|The common predators of Rhynchocinetes uritai are herring, salmon, sculpin and <b>flatfishes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In general, <b>flatfishes</b> rely {{on their}} {{camouflage}} for avoiding predators, but some have conspicuous eyespots (e.g., Microchirus ocellatus) and several small tropical species (at least Aseraggodes, Pardachirus and Zebrias) are poisonous. Juveniles of Soleichthys maculosus mimic toxic flatworms of the genus Pseudobiceros in both colours and swimming mode. [...] Conversely, a few octopus species {{have been reported to}} mimic <b>flatfishes</b> in colours, shape and swimming mode.|$|R
50|$|Aseraggodes is a genus of soles {{native to}} the Indian and Pacific oceans. These small <b>flatfishes</b> are poisonous.|$|R
5|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A {{wide variety}} of fish have been {{recorded}} as prey for this species: sardines, herring, anchovies, ladyfish, sea catfish, cornetfish, <b>flatfish,</b> threadfins, mullet, mackerel, jacks, groupers, snook, porgies, mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on rays and skates, as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and sharpnose sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Off South Africa, jacks and herring {{are the most important}} prey. Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} edition Darwin {{inserted}} {{a new chapter}} VII (renumbering the subsequent chapters) to respond to criticisms of earlier editions, including the objection that many features of organisms were not adaptive and {{could not have been}} produced by natural selection. He said some such features could have been by-products of adaptive changes to other features, and that often features seemed non-adaptive because their function was unknown, as shown by his book on Fertilisation of Orchids that explained how their elaborate structures facilitated pollination by insects. Much of the chapter responds to George Jackson Mivart's criticisms, including his claim that features such as baleen filters in whales, <b>flatfish</b> with both eyes {{on one side and the}} camouflage of stick insects could not have evolved through natural selection because intermediate stages would not have been adaptive. Darwin proposed scenarios for the incremental evolution of each feature.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups also}} {{underwent}} major radiations. Based on molecular sequencing and fossil dating, Neoaves appeared to radiate after the K–Pg boundary. They even produced giant, flightless forms, {{such as the}} herbivorous Gastornis and Dromornithidae, and the predatory Phorusrhacidae. The extinction of Cretaceous lizards and snakes {{may have led to}} the radiation of modern groups such as iguanas, monitor lizards, and boas. On land, giant boid and enormous madtsoiid snakes appeared, and in the seas, giant sea snakes radiated. Teleost fish diversified explosively, filling the niches left vacant by the extinction. Groups appearing in the Paleocene and Eocene include billfish, tunas, eels, and <b>flatfish.</b> Major changes are also seen in Paleogene insect communities. Many groups of ants were present in the Cretaceous, but in the Eocene ants became dominant and diverse, with larger colonies. Butterflies diversified as well, perhaps {{to take the place of}} leaf-eating insects wiped out by the extinction. The advanced mound-building termites, Termitidae, also appear to have risen in importance.|$|E
40|$|Fishes {{belonging}} to the families Bothidae (flounders), Cynoglossidae (tongue soles), Psettodidae (Indian halibut) and Soleidae (soles) are popularly known as <b>flatfishes.</b> Eleven genera and 25 species of <b>flatfishes</b> contribute to minor or major fisheries along the Indian coast (Table 1). A compressed and asymmetrical body with both the eyes lying {{on one side of}} the head is characteristic of the <b>flatfishes.</b> Most of them are small to medium sized fishes barring Psettodes erumei, which attains 60 cm length. They are exclusive benthic fishes, found mainly on muddy or sandy bottom of shelf areas; most of them are restricted to shallow waters of less than 60 m depth. However, P. erumei and Cynoglossus bilineatus are known to occur up to 100 m and 400 m depth respectivel...|$|R

5|$|The primary food of Galapagos {{sharks are}} benthic bony fishes (including eels, sea bass, <b>flatfish,</b> flatheads, and triggerfish) and octopuses. They also {{occasionally}} take surface-dwelling prey such as mackerel, flyingfish, and squid. As the sharks grow larger, they consume {{increasing numbers of}} elasmobranchs (rays and smaller sharks, including of their own species) and crustaceans, as well as indigestible items such as leaves, coral, rocks, and garbage. At the Galapagos Islands, this species has been observed attacking Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), and marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). While collecting fishes at Clipperton Island, Limbaugh (1963) noted that juvenile Galapagos sharks surrounded the boat, with multiple individuals rushing at virtually anything trailing {{in the water and}} striking the boat bottom, oars, and marker buoys. The sharks were not slowed by rotenone (a fish toxin) or shark repellent, and some followed the boat into water so shallow that their backs were exposed.|$|E

25|$|Benthic fish, {{sometimes}} called groundfish, are denser than water, {{so they can}} rest on the sea floor. They either lie-and-wait as ambush predators, maybe covering themselves with sand or otherwise camouflaging themselves, or move actively over the bottom in search for food. Benthic fish which can bury themselves include dragonets, <b>flatfish</b> and stingrays.|$|E
