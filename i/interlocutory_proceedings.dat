40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{concerned}} with summary applications made to judges, masters, associate judges, or registrars in chambers {{during the course of}} a proceeding, which do not finally determine the rights of the parties. These are known generically as <b>interlocutory</b> procedures or <b>proceedings.</b> The chamber jurisdiction replaced the historical practice of such applications being heard in a judge’s chambers rather than in open court. Factual disputes and substantive issues that involve a final determination of the matters in dispute are heard and resolved by a trial court presided over by a judge...|$|R
40|$|The Act impacts {{the three}} statutorily defined methods of {{condemnation}} proceedings previously established by Georgia law. The three condemnation methods are: (1) the three assessor method; (2) the special master method; and (3) {{the declaration of}} taking method. 2 ̆ 7 In condemnation proceedings over which assessors preside, the Act establishes minimal qualifications for assessors, limits the assessors 2 ̆ 7 costs, and allows reasonable expenses to be awarded on appeal under certain circumstances. In condemnation proceedings before special masters, the Act provides for special master panels and allows reasonable expenses to be awarded on appeal under certain circumstances. The Act also provides for advertising procedures {{in connection with the}} condemnation of property for public transportation purposes. Finally, the Act changes the provisions relating to <b>interlocutory</b> hearings in <b>proceedings</b> regarding condemnation of property for public transportation purposes...|$|R
40|$|The {{office of}} special prothonotary was created in 1975 by an {{amendment}} to the Code of Civil Procedure. The main purpose of the change was to ease the administration of justice before the courts. For this reason, the special prothonotary received many assignments which were reserved until then to a judge sitting in chambers and even to the court itself. Such transfer of duties and powers may conflict with section 96 of the BNA Act, which acts as a bar to prevent the withdrawal of judicial functions from a superior, county or district court. This paper deals with the interferences between various sections of the Code of Civil Procedure and section 96 of the BNA Act. The first part of the paper deals with the approach adopted by the courts. The true test, according to the case-law, is to determine the nature of the function involved. Since only judicial functions are protected by section 96, it is intravires the Legislature of Quebec to confer on a board or tribunal administrative or ministerial powers. If the transfer involves judicial functions, the courts will use the test adopted by the Privy Council in Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan v. John East Iron Works and by Sir Lyman Duff in In re Adoption Act, and examine whether the transferee is analogous to a superior, district or county court. The courts will also have to apply the «  1867 statute books test » : was the particular function conferred to the prothonotary before 1867 ? If the results of each of the two tests are affirmative, then the function is one protected by section 96 of the BNA Act and its transfer is ultra vires the provincial Legislature. If the results are negative, the courts will examine if the provisions involved have the effect of vesting in the special prothonotary the powers of a superior court judge. If the courts conclude that it is so, then, the assignment is ultra vires the powers of the provincial Legislature. The second part deals with each of the assignments transferred to the special prothonotary. These are threefold in nature: 1. Actions by default to appear or by default to plead under article 195 C. C. P.; 2. Jurisdiction under article 44. 1 (1) C. C. P.; 3. <b>Interlocutory</b> or incidental <b>proceedings,</b> contested or not, but, if so, with the consent of the parties. The paper concludes that most of the provisions dealing with the duties and powers of the special prothonotary are unconstitutiona...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to courtroom advocacy White was a prolific legal {{writer in the}} course of the ICTR prosecutions, making significant written contributions to numerous indictments, two pre-trial briefs, three final briefs [...] and several hundred <b>interlocutory</b> <b>proceedings</b> on points of law and evidence. [...] The ‘Military 1’ final brief alone exceeded 950 pages in length, and began with White’s authorship of an overview section entitled ‘The Philosophy of Genocide’ that placed the trial evidence of the events into a broader context. [...] Most of these contributions were during a period when there was little practical legal precedent in international criminal law and many of the issues were being dealt with for the first time.|$|E
5000|$|Further steps {{have been}} taken {{with a view to}} {{simplification}} of procedure. By Order xxx. rule i (as amended in 1897), a summons, called a summons for directions, has to be taken out by a plaintiff immediately after the appearance of the defendant, and upon such summons an order is to be made respecting pleadings, and a number of <b>interlocutory</b> <b>proceedings.</b> To make such an order at that early stage would seem to demand a prescience and intelligent anticipation of future events which can hardly be expected of a master, or even a judge in chambers, except in simple cases, involving a single issue of law or fact which the parties are agreed in presenting to the court. The effect of the rule is that the plaintiff cannot deliver his statement of claim, or take any step in the action without the leave of the judge. In Chancery cases the order usually made is that the plaintiff deliver his [...]statement of claim, {{and the rest of the}} summons stand over, and the practical effect is merely to add a few pounds to the costs. It may be doubted whether, as applied to the majority of actions, the rule does not proceed on wrong lines, and whether it would not be better to leave the parties, who know the exigencies of their case better even than a judge in chambers, to proceed in their own way, subject to stringent provisions for immediate payment of the costs occasioned by unnecessary, vexatious, or dilatory proceedings. The order does not apply to admiralty cases or to proceedings under the order next mentioned.|$|E
40|$|Chapter 15 {{outlines}} Affidavits in detail. An affidavit is a {{sworn statement}} used {{in support of}} or against an application in court. Affidavits, like oral evidence, {{are subject to the}} rule against hearsay. However, the hearsay rule does not apply to affidavits used in <b>interlocutory</b> <b>proceedings</b> (which are accepted on information and belief, provided the source of the information and the grounds of belief are stated). The Rules of Court contain detailed requirements as to the form and structure of affidavits. There are complicated rules concerning the form of the jurat and the procedures for swearing or affirming the contents of an affidavit. A jurat (meaning ‘he or she swears’) is a statement {{at the end of an}} affidavit setting out the name of the deponent, his or her signature, where and when the affidavit was made, the name of the person who took (witnessed) the affidavit, and the signature and title (or description) of the person who took the affidavit. Affidavits may annex or exhibit documents to which they refer, depending on the jurisdiction. Affidavits are required to be filed and served before they can be used in proceedings. The maker of the affidavit may also be required to attend the court for cross-examination. The courts have power to prevent scandalous and irrelevant affidavit material making its way onto the court file. Alterations or erasures to affidavits must be authenticated by appropriate procedures. Non-compliance with the rules governing affidavits can be sanctioned with leave of the court. Effective affidavits are built upon the exercise of drafting skills. Brevity, style and attention to detail should be the hallmarks of an affidavit. Affidavits are always a reflection of your ability to gather and present evidence in written form. But never forget that an affidavit is that of the deponent, not his or her lawyer...|$|E

40|$|In the European Union {{choice of}} law rules, {{uniformity}} and legal certainty are the principal concern of the European legislator. Two main issues are considered. First, it is considered whether the exclusion of matters of procedure and evidence from the legislative competence of the European legislator threatens the aim of legal certainty and uniformity. Second, {{the extent to which}} the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) has contributed to the aims of legal certainty in interpreting the escape clause for contractual obligations is analysed. On the first issue, this research paper focuses on problems relating to the English procedure on the determination of the applicable law in English courts (or common law courts) during <b>interlocutory</b> <b>proceedings.</b> It is questioned whether a tentative or preliminary determination of the applicable law promotes the aim of legal certainty and stability of legal relationship among parties during judicial proceedings. It is questioned whether the standard of the good arguable case in determining whether or not English law applies at the ex parte stage in determining the existence of the English traditional common law jurisdiction, for the purpose of service on a foreign defendant encourages forum shopping in English courts, and thereby threatens the aim of uniformity in determining the applicable law. In addition (also on the first issue), it is questioned whether the English rule of evidence on proof of foreign law promotes the application of the law of the forum, and thereby threatens uniformity. On the second issue, it is assessed whether the decision of the CJEU in interpreting the escape clauses for commercial contracts, and employment contracts has promoted the aims of legal certainty. The conclusion reached is that despite the European legislator’s emphasis on the aims of uniformity in the {{choice of law}} process, a diverse approach or outcome on the determination of the applicable law cannot be avoided...|$|E
