Under the current system, items of <b>general</b> <b>transfer</b> payment include balanced transfer payment, transfer payment to ethnic minority areas, transfer payments to rural areas for taxes reform, and transfer payment for salary adjustment (Ministry of Finance 2012). <b>General</b> <b>transfer</b> payments are not specifically designated for any usage; local governments accepting <b>general</b> <b>transfer</b> payments may follow the relevant regulations and use the money according their practical needs.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates human {{aversive}} Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) and possible influences of outcome devaluation and instrumental overtraining on this effect. PIT measures {{the extent to}} which a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) can increase instrumental responses independently paired with the same (outcome-specific transfer) or a different (<b>general</b> <b>transfer)</b> reinforcer. Two measures of PIT were obtained: the percentage of instrumental responses and the vigor of such responses. Thirty-eight volunteers performed a standard PIT task sequence. Results showed a double dissociation between outcome-specific and general transfer: the first selectively expressed in the amount of responses, the second in the vigor measure solely. Furthermore, outcome-specific transfer was enhanced by overtraining, but not affected by devaluation. <b>General</b> <b>transfer,</b> on the other hand, was affected by neither overtraining, nor devaluation. A positive correlation between <b>general</b> <b>transfer</b> and sensitivity to punishments was found. Findings are discussed in terms of hypothetically different underlying neurobehavioral mechanisms and their relations to habits and goal-directed behavior. Work was completed at the Behavioral and Clinical Neuroscience Institute, University of Cambridge (UK), supported by a joint award from the MRC and Wellcome Trust (G 00001354) and a Trust Senior Investigator Award (104631 /Z/ 14 /Z) awarded to TWR and a fellowship from the University of Bologna to SG...|$|R

40|$|Among Chinaâ€™s current central-local fiscal grants system, <b>general</b> fiscal <b>transfers</b> is {{the only}} type of grants applied for fiscal {{equalization}} purpose. Its scale and effects have been the major determinants for evaluating equalization effectiveness of the overall central-provincial fiscal adjustment system. After analysing the development trend in the scale of Chinaâ€™s <b>general</b> fiscal <b>transfers</b> and measuring {{the effectiveness of the}} overall central-provincial fiscal transfers by newly-designed indicators, this paper finds out that the relative small scale of <b>general</b> fiscal <b>transfers</b> is the main factor to explain current undesirable equalization effects of the overall central-provincial fiscal transfers. In order to effectively address regional fiscal disparities, it is recommended then that Chinaâ€™s current fiscal transfer system should be improved with an attempt to further increase the relative scale of <b>general</b> fiscal <b>transfers...</b>|$|R
