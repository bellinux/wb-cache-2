50|$|Localized <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> has a {{tendency}} towards spontaneous resolution. Localized lesions have been treated with potent topical corticosteroids.|$|E
50|$|<b>Granuloma</b> <b>annulare,</b> microscopically, {{consists}} of dermal epithelioid histiocytes around a central zone of mucin - a so-called palisaded granuloma.|$|E
50|$|The {{disease was}} first {{described}} in 1895 by Thomas Colcott Fox {{and it was}} named <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> by Henry Radcliffe Crocker in 1902.|$|E
50|$|Perforating <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> is a skin {{condition}} of unknown cause, usually {{appearing on the}} dorsal hands, presenting as papules with a central keratotic core.|$|E
50|$|Localized <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> is a skin {{condition}} of unknown cause, tending to affect {{children and young}} to middle-aged adults, usually appearing on the lateral or dorsal surfaces of the fingers or hands, elbows, dorsal feet, and ankles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> is {{a fairly}} rare, chronic {{dermatological}} condition which presents as reddish bumps on the skin arranged in a circle or ring. It can initially occur at any age and is four times more common in females.|$|E
50|$|Generalized <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> is a skin {{condition}} of unknown cause, tending to affect {{women in the}} fifth and sixth decades, presenting as a diffuse but symmetrical, papular or annular eruption of more than ten skin lesions, and often hundreds.|$|E
5000|$|Patch-type <b>{{granuloma}}</b> <b>annulare</b> (also {{known as}} [...] "Macular granuloma annulare") is a skin condition of unknown cause, more commonly affecting women between 30 and 70 years of age, characterized by flat or slightly palpable erythematous or red-brown skin lesions.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> {{is usually}} {{asymptomatic}} and self-limiting with {{a course of}} about 2 years. Initial treatment is generally topical steroid creams, followed by oral steroids and finally intradermal injections {{at the site of}} each ring. Treatment success varies widely, with most patients finding only brief success with the above-mentioned treatments. New research out of India suggests that the combination of rifampin (600 mg), ofloxacin (400 mg), and minocycline hydrochloride (100 mg) once monthly, or ROM therapy, produces promising results. Most lesions of <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> disappear in pre-pubertal patients with no treatment within two years while older patients (50+) have rings for upwards of 20 years. The appearance of new rings years later is not uncommon.|$|E
5000|$|Subcutaneous <b>{{granuloma}}</b> <b>annulare</b> (also {{known as}} [...] "Deep granuloma annulare," [...] and [...] "Pseudorheumatoid nodule") is a skin condition of unknown cause, most commonly affecting children, with girls affected twice as commonly as boys, characterized by skin lesions most {{often on the}} lower legs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> is a {{skin disease}} of unknown cause in which granulomas {{are found in}} the dermis of the skin. However, it is not a true granuloma. Typically there is a central zone of necrobiotic {{generation}} of collagen with surrounding inflammation and mucin deposition on pathology.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from the}} visible rash, <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> is usually asymptomatic. Sometimes the rash may burn or itch. Patients usually notice {{a ring of}} small, firm bumps (papules) over {{the backs of the}} forearms, hands or feet, often {{centered}} on joints or knuckles. The bumps are caused by the clustering of T cells below the skin. These papules start as very small, pimple looking bumps, which spread over time from that size to dime, quarter, half-dollar size and beyond. Occasionally, multiple rings may join into one. Rarely, <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> may appear as a firm nodule under the skin of the arms or legs. It also occurs on the sides and circumferential at the waist and without therapy can continue to be present for many years. Outbreaks continue to develop {{at the edges of the}} aging rings.|$|E
50|$|Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is the {{methyl ester}} of fumaric acid. DMF was {{initially}} {{recognized as a}} very effective hypoxic cell radiosensitizer. Later, DMF combined with three other fumaric acid esters (FAE) was licensed in Germany as oral therapy for psoriasis (trade name Fumaderm). Other diseases, such as necrobiosis lipoidica, <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare,</b> and sarcoidosis were also found to respond to treatment with DMF in case reports or small patient series. Phase III clinical trials found that DMF (BG-12) successfully reduced relapse rate and increased time to progression of disability in multiple sclerosis (trade name Tecfidera). DMF {{is thought to have}} immunomodulatory properties without significant immunosuppression.|$|E
50|$|From 1877, Crocker was {{a member}} (and later a fellow) of the Royal College of Physicians. Following the death of Tilbury Fox in 1879, Crocker succeeded him as {{physician}} {{in the department of}} dermatology at University College Hospital. In this position, Crocker was able to devote himself {{to the study of the}} skin and its diseases. Although a specialist, in his clinical work, he emphasised the value of treating the whole patient. His research concentrated on the epidemiology of skin diseases and histology, noting the importance of microscopic inspection of skin cells. During his career, he was the first to describe or name diseases such as <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> and erythema elevatum diutinum.|$|E
50|$|Sarcoidosis is a {{systemic}} inflammatory disease {{that can affect}} any organ, although it can be asymptomatic and is discovered by accident in about 5% of cases. Common symptoms, {{which tend to be}} vague, include fatigue (unrelieved by sleep; occurs in 66% of cases), lack of energy, weight loss, joint aches and pains (which occur in about 70% of cases), arthritis (14-38% of persons), dry eyes, swelling of the knees, blurry vision, shortness of breath, a dry, hacking cough, or skin lesions. Less commonly, people may cough up blood. The cutaneous symptoms vary, and range from rashes and noduli (small bumps) to erythema nodosum, <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare,</b> or lupus pernio. Sarcoidosis and cancer may mimic one another, making the distinction difficult.|$|E
50|$|NL is {{diagnosed}} by a skin biopsy, demonstrating superficial and deep perivascular and interstitial mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate (including lymphocytes, plasma cells, mononucleated and multinucleated histiocytes, and eosinophils) in the dermis and subcutis, {{as well as}} necrotising vasculitis with adjacent necrobiosis and necrosis of adnexal structures. Areas of necrobiosis are often more extensive and less well defined than in <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare.</b> Presence of lipid in necrobiotic areas may be demonstrated by Sudan stains. Cholesterol clefts, fibrin, and mucin may also be present in areas of necrobiosis. Depending on {{the severity of the}} necrobiosis, certain cell types may be more predominant. When a lesion is in its early stages, neutrophils may be present, whereas in later stages of development lymphocytes and histiocytes may be more predominant.|$|E

40|$|Plain oral glucose {{tolerance}} tests (OGTT) and cortisone stressed oral glucose tolerance tests (COGTT), {{both with}} plasma insulin measurements, {{were carried out}} on 15 non-diabetic cases of ‘typical’ <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare,</b> on one case of ‘atypical’ <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> and on 36 matched controls. No {{significant difference was found}} in either test between patients with ‘typical’ <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> and the controls, in glucose tolerance, total overall insulin secretion, initial insulin secretion during the first hour, the time of occurrence of the peak of the insulin secretion, or the degree of glycosuria. These results support the findings of some of the other investigators in this field. The one case of ‘atypical’ <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> also gave normal results in these tests. This does not support most other workers who have found an association clinically between this variety of the disease and diabetes mellitus. It is postulated that there is no association between ‘typical’ <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> and the pre-diabetic state. An association between ‘atypical’ <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> and the pre-diabetic state is not proven...|$|E
40|$|<b>Granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> is {{relatively}} common idiopathic disease of dermis and subcutaneous tissue. It {{can be observed}} of all races and ages, but it effects woman more often (2 : 1). Widespread <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare,</b> diffuse but symmetrically located occurs as papular or annular pustules composed of more than ten and often hundreds of lesions. Because of the rare occurrence of common <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> cases with photosensitivity distribution, we present {{a case of a}} 49 year-old woman who had generalized <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> on the neck, dorsal aspects of the hands and extensor surfaces of the arms showing photosensitive distribution and that responded well to topical and intralesional steroid treatment...|$|E
30|$|<b>Granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> (GA) {{represents}} {{a group of}} benign dermatoses of unknown aetiology which include cutaneous (localised, generalised or perforating) and subcutaneous types.

40|$|<b>Granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> is a benign, asymptomatic, {{relatively}} common, often self-limited chronic granulomatos {{disorder of}} the skin that can affect both children and adults. The primary skin lesion usually is grouped papules in an enlarging annular shape, with color ranging from flesh-colored to erythematous. The two most common types of <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> are localized, which typically is found on the lateral or dorsal surfaces of the hands and feet; and disseminated, which is widespread. Rarely, familial cases of <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> has been reported. Herein, we report two sisters with annular papules and plaques diagnosed as <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> with the clinical and pathological findings.

40|$|A 57 -year-old, fair-skinned female {{patient with}} lesions of <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> located on her forearms - with signs of actinic damage - is described. No {{response}} was observed after successive treatments with topical corticosteroids and oral pentoxifylline. Four years later, the patient developed open comedones {{on the rim}} of <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> lesions. The loss of elastic fibers seen in both <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> and solar elastosis is presumed to have induced the appearance of open comedones, because of a loss of supporting properties of the dermis inducing a distension of the infundibular canal of the sebaceous follicle, as seen in the Favre-Racouchot disease and actinic comedonal plaque. Concomitantly, the patient developed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Treatment with insulin resulted in the disappearance of open comedones and notably regression of lesions of <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare.</b> Response to insulin therapy in our case supports the hypothesis that insulinopenia could participate in the development of <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> in some cases...|$|E
40|$|<b>Granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> is {{a benign}} {{inflammatory}} dermatosis. Cell-mediated immunity and delayed hypersensitivity are proposed pathogenic mechanisms.

40|$|A middle aged man {{suffered}} with insulin dependent diabetes, autoimmune Addison's disease, myxoedema, {{and severe}} ulcerative colitis, {{for which he}} had undergone subtotal colectomy with formation of an ileostomy. <b>Granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> confined to the anterior abdominal wall was diagnosed in 1981. In 1983 an episode of severe colicky pain and excessive working of the ileostomy occurred associated with severe hyperglycaemia and increased irritation of the <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare.</b> Laparotomy disclosed adhesions and numerous white nodules over bowel, mesentery, and peritoneum histologically identical with the skin lesions. Two further episodes of subacute small bowel obstruction occurred, and a repeat laparotomy showed widespread intra-abdominal <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare.</b> Visceral <b>granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> appears not to have been reported before, and in this patient exacerbation of the skin lesion was associated with poor diabetic control...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT CONTEXT: Localized {{scleroderma}} (morphea) {{is characterized}} by fibrosis of skin and subcutaneous tissue. <b>Granuloma</b> <b>annulare</b> is a relatively common disease that {{is characterized by}} dermal papules and arciform plaques.
