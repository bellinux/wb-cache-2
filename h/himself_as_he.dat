5|$|Larry Hagman and Rex Reed {{also make}} cameos; Hagman plays an army major {{in charge of}} a convoy that is {{transporting}} one of the missiles, and Reed plays <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> meets Lois and Clark outside the Daily Planet headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Veloso {{designed}} the album's cover <b>himself,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{had done before}} for three other albums. He went through a long design {{process in which the}} cover's colors, fonts, and text positioning were changed frequently. Veloso chose the color purple for the cover's background because it is mentioned multiple times in the album itself.|$|E
5|$|Once a male {{has found}} a mate, he selects a territory, marking the {{boundaries}} by warbling as he flies from perch to perch. After circling the perimeter, he performs two flight displays, first repeating a low, flat flight, then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight, tucking his wings close to his body, plummeting earthwards and catching <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spreads his wings to glide upward {{in a series of}} loops. Two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony, perhaps to aid in defense against predators.|$|E
5000|$|ESPN's {{obituary}} listed him as [...] "a character, a charmer, and a drag racer {{who wanted}} to enjoy <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>he</b> wanted to win." ...|$|R
50|$|According to the Wall Street Journal, {{early in}} his career Christie {{described}} <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> pro-choice; <b>he</b> later became pro-life.|$|R
50|$|Lee is a trans man and {{describes}} <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> queer. <b>He</b> lives in Louisiana with his husband and daughter.|$|R
5|$|Several {{additional}} performers {{were selected}} over this fifty contestant limit; one being Briony, {{who had been}} rejected initially due to nerves hampering her performance, but who returned for a second chance and was allowed in by Ian. A further four, whom the panel had rejected, were contacted by Lloyd Webber <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> personally believed them to be potential Marias.|$|E
5|$|Following high school, Ross {{embarked}} on his professional career, getting {{selected by the}} Detroit Tigers in the fourth round of the 1999 Major League Baseball draft. He reached the Major Leagues in 2003, but suffered a torn ACL which caused him to miss most of September. He {{was traded to the}} Los Angeles Dodgers following spring training in 2004, appearing in a handful of games with them in 2005. In 2006, he played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Cincinnati Reds, and the Florida Marlins. It was in Florida that he finally established <b>himself,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> played with the Marlins through 2010. He was used mainly as a reserve outfielder in 2006 and 2007, but during the 2008 season he took over a starting role. He would be a starting outfielder {{for the rest of his}} Marlins career, playing centerfield or right field. In 2009, he hit a career-high 24 home runs and won the Marlins' Charlie Hough Good Guy award.|$|E
25|$|One should {{primarily}} {{be concerned}} with {{their relationship with the}} essence of God, rather than God <b>himself,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is beyond comprehension. The essence of God is referred to in its teachings as Light.|$|E
50|$|Toomey {{identifies}} <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> pro-life. <b>He</b> {{has stated}} that he would support penalties for doctors who perform illegal abortions.|$|R
60|$|He {{answered}} nothing, buzzing to <b>himself</b> softly, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> pursued his thoughts. My temper was going.|$|R
60|$|So Robin lay {{watching}} the Friar, and the Friar, all unknowing {{that he was}} so overlooked, ate his meal placidly. At last he was done, and, having first wiped his greasy hands upon the ferns and wild thyme (and sweeter napkin ne'er had king in all the world), he took up his flask and began talking to <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> though <b>he</b> were another man, and answering <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> though <b>he</b> were somebody else.|$|R
25|$|In October 2015, WWE {{released}} a second Sting DVD titled Sting: Into the Light. The three-disc set features a behind-the-scenes documentary with Sting <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> prepares {{to step into}} a WWE ring {{for the first time}} ever at WrestleMania 31.|$|E
25|$|Swerdlow {{determined}} that Hipparchus relates the distances {{to the sun}} and moon using a construction found in Ptolemy. It would not be surprising if this calculation had been originally developed by Hipparchus <b>himself,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was a primary source for the Almagest.|$|E
25|$|Australian rapper Iggy Azalea makes a cameo {{appearance}} as a Race Wars fan {{and a female}} racer; she contributed to the soundtrack. American singer-rapper T-Pain appears as <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> DJs a party in Abu Dhabi. Klement Tinaj cameos as a Race Wars Racer.|$|E
60|$|Jet, {{confused}} and bewildered by the strange {{position in which}} <b>he</b> found <b>himself,</b> did <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was bidden.|$|R
60|$|Nostromo had paused; {{then began}} {{again in a}} changed tone, sombre, {{speaking}} to <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> though <b>he</b> had forgotten the doctor's existence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Waring," [...] he said thoughtfully, {{turning over}} the name to <b>himself,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> {{attached}} it to no particular individual. [...] "Waring--Waring--Waring." ...|$|R
25|$|However, the Marquis {{unexpectedly}} {{enters and}} discovers Leonora and Alvaro together. He threatens Alvaro with death, {{and in order}} to remove any suspicion as to Leonora’s purity, Alvaro surrenders <b>himself.</b> <b>As</b> <b>he</b> flings down his pistol, it goes off, mortally wounding the Marquis who dies cursing his daughter.|$|E
25|$|The 1-24 was loaned to Paul A. Schweizer {{to compete}} in the 1957 US Nationals, which were held in Elmira, New York. Burr was unable to fly the 1-24 in that contest <b>himself,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was contest director. Paul Schweizer did not {{complete}} the competition as his father died during the contest and he withdrew.|$|E
25|$|The humour of Hay's films {{has been}} {{described}} as subversive and similar to that of fellow English comedian Frank Randle. His films are often characterised as exhibiting traits of Anti-authoritarianism and having a satirical approach towards how authority figures are portrayed, this is notable with Hay <b>himself,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> often played an incompetent authority figure who struggled not to be found out, but whose idiocy was discovered by those around him.|$|E
60|$|The face of Marcus became troubled, <b>as</b> though <b>he</b> were {{reasoning}} with <b>himself,</b> <b>as</b> though <b>he</b> {{wished to}} take her at her word and go, yet could not.|$|R
5000|$|Zuzens lists <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> retired. <b>He</b> wrote against Canada's {{public health}} system in 2000, {{describing}} {{it as the}} [...] "Canada Waiting List" [...] system.|$|R
60|$|The {{carpenter}} came aft at this moment, balancing <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> best <b>he</b> could, for {{the deck}} {{was only a}} few degrees off the perpendicular.|$|R
25|$|In the {{original}} version, {{the game is}} divided into five chapters. The first four provide back-story for the Hero’s party members, while the fifth follows the Hero <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> meets up with the other characters. Chapter One begins when a knight from Burland rescues abducted children from monsters. He discovers a plot to kill the Legendary Hero and decides to {{set out on a}} quest to protect him.|$|E
25|$|The {{city hall}} has {{attempted}} to recruit peregrine falcons to nest in aeries outside the dome. Pigeon droppings have to be periodically cleaned from the pair of glass-covered light wells that were covered with concrete {{at the height of}} modernism. The new city hall in nearby San Jose has already drawn at least one pair of falcons, discovered by Mayor Ron Gonzales <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> saw pigeon feathers descend past a window during a meeting.|$|E
25|$|I {{would have}} the weakest woman read the Gospels and the Epistles of St Paul. I would have those words {{translated}} into all languages, so that not only Scots and Irishmen, but Turks and Saracens might read them. I long for the ploughboy to sing them to <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> follows the plow, the weaver to hum them {{to the tune of}} his shuttle, the traveler to beguile with them the dullness of his journey.|$|E
6000|$|... "But what the--what in thunder {{does it all}} mean?" [...] {{the captain}} demanded, pulling <b>himself</b> up <b>as</b> <b>he</b> glanced towards Katharine.|$|R
50|$|Charles is of Jewish {{heritage}} on his father's side, and {{has described}} <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> Jewish. <b>He</b> {{is a fan}} of the Baltimore Orioles and Baltimore Ravens.|$|R
60|$|His figure cut {{the misty}} {{background}} and <b>he</b> carried <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> were not disturbed. In fact, Jimmy imagined {{he had expected}} something like this.|$|R
25|$|De la Rosa {{parked his}} stalled car {{next to the}} road leading to the pit. Upon getting out, he {{was told by the}} marshals to jump over the barrier. He did so, and fell six feet into a small river. The {{incident}} was humorous to those watching on television, but not to De la Rosa <b>himself,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> complained about the episode to the press afterward, saying the marshals did not tell him what was behind the barrier.|$|E
25|$|Some Christians {{believe that}} the God worshiped by the Hebrew people of the pre-Christian era had always {{revealed}} <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did through Jesus; but that this was never obvious until Jesus was born (see John 1). Also, though the Angel of the Lord spoke to the Patriarchs, revealing God to them, some believe {{it has always been}} only through the Spirit of God granting them understanding, that men have been able to later perceive that they had been visited by God himself.|$|E
25|$|It was in {{his second}} season that Rowley began {{to make a name for}} <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> broke Arthur Chandler's club record for the most goals in a season, netting 38 times. He then broke his own record again the {{following}} season, scoring 41 times in 42 games, 39 of these goals coming in the league, earning him the Second Division golden boot award. He scored a further 36 goals in the 1953–54 season helping fire Leicester to the Second Division title.|$|E
60|$|Sam was willing, {{and soon}} Tom was {{balancing}} <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> best <b>he</b> could. He felt around with care, Sam moving from {{point to point}} as directed.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘It is,’ {{replied the}} driver, rubbing <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> ached, after {{throwing}} the reins to the ostler. ‘And I never was {{so glad to}} see it.’ ...|$|R
60|$|He {{struggled}} {{for a while}} with <b>himself,</b> <b>as</b> though <b>he</b> were {{on the point of}} giving way to anger, but prudence had the best of the controversy.|$|R
