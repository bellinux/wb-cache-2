5|$|Another {{cause of}} revulsion against Webster was her attempt to {{impersonate}} Thomas. She {{had managed to}} perpetrate the impersonation for two weeks, implying that middle-class identity amounted {{to little more than}} cultivating the right demeanour and having the appropriate clothes and possessions, whether or not they had been earned. John Church, the publican whom Webster had attempted to implicate, was himself a former servant who had risen to lower middle-class status and earned a measure of prosperity and <b>effective</b> <b>management</b> of his pub. His commitment to bettering himself through hard work was in keeping with the ethic of the time. Webster, in contrast, had simply stolen her briefly-held middle-class identity.|$|E

5|$|Thus, {{engineer}} and physicist Hannes Alfvén identified two fundamental prerequisites for <b>effective</b> <b>management</b> of high-level radioactive waste: (1) stable geological formations, and (2) stable human institutions {{over hundreds of}} thousands of years. As Alfvén suggests, no known human civilization has ever endured for so long, and no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent radioactive waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period. Nevertheless, avoiding confronting the risks associated with managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude. Radioactive waste management is an example of policy analysis that requires special attention to ethical concerns, examined in the light of uncertainty and futurity: consideration of 'the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations'.|$|E

25|$|The {{numbers of}} {{visitors}} to the Zimbabwean side of the falls has historically been {{much higher than the}} number visiting the Zambia side, due to the greater development of the visitor facilities there. However, the number of tourists visiting Zimbabwe began to decline in the early 2000s as political tensions between supporters and opponents of president Robert Mugabe increased. In 2006, hotel occupancy on the Zimbabwean side hovered at around 30%, while the Zambian side was at near-capacity, with rates in top hotels reaching US$630 per night. The rapid development has prompted the United Nations to consider revoking the Falls' status as a World Heritage Site.

25|$|Derby County, {{promoted}} to the First Division in 1969 after a lengthy absence, emerged as a force during the 1970s, winning the league title in 1972 under the controversial but <b>effective</b> <b>management</b> of Brian Clough, and again in 1975 under Clough's successor Dave Mackay. Clough, after a disastrous 44-day spell as Don Revie's successor at Leeds United, enjoyed even greater success at Nottingham Forest, taking the East Midlands club to promotion in 1977, the league title and League Cup in 1978 and to a further League Cup and the European Cup in 1979, before retaining their European crown in 1980. During this run of outstanding success, Clough also shelled out British football's first £1million transfer fee for the Birmingham City forward Trevor Francis, who signed for Forest in February 1979. Also among his acquisitions was the goalkeeper Peter Shilton, {{who went on to}} win a record of 125 full caps for England.|$|E
25|$|There has {{previously}} been no effective method of treatment for the neurobehavioral aspects of the disease. Even children treated from birth with allopurinol develop behavioral and neurologic problems, despite never having had high serum concentrations of uric acid. Self-injurious and other behaviors are best managed {{by a combination of}} medical, physical, and behavioral interventions. The self-mutilation is often reduced by using restraints. Sixty percent of individuals have their teeth extracted in order to avoid self-injury, which families have found to be an <b>effective</b> <b>management</b> technique. Because stress increases self-injury, behavioral management through aversive techniques (which would normally reduce self-injury) actually increases self-injury in individuals with LNS. Nearly all affected individuals need restraints to prevent self-injury, and are restrained more than 75% of the time. This is often at their own request, and occasionally involves restraints that would appear to be ineffective, as they do not physically prevent biting. Families report that affected individuals are more at ease when restrained.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Effective</b> pain <b>management</b> {{following}} day surgery is a challenging issue. For {{the majority of}} patients severe pain is uncommon. However, a number of patients experience considerable pain following discharge. Uncontrolled pain {{is one of the}} main causes of re-admission to an inpatient bed {{following day}} surgery and a leading cause of patient dissatisfaction with it. Conclusion: This article reviews the literature and there is a discussion of the issues concerning <b>effective</b> pain <b>management</b> in day surgery. The drugs commonly used in day surgery practice are outlined to demonstrate the constraints that day surgery practices can impose on <b>effective</b> pain <b>management.</b> Day surgery is continually expanding and hip replacement and cholecystectomy are now being undertaken in day surgery facilities (Amarnath et al 2002, Berger 2003). The role of the nurse in <b>effective</b> pain <b>management</b> is therefore crucial amid such innovative developments as, even when explicitly instructed, the majority of patients still experience some post-operative pain (Apfelbaum et al 2003, Dewar et al 2003) ...|$|R
