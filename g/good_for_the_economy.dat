25|$|The {{paradox of}} thrift (or paradox of saving) is a paradox of economics. The paradox states that an {{increase}} in autonomous saving leads to a decrease in aggregate demand and thus a decrease in gross output which will in turn lower total saving. The paradox is, narrowly speaking, that total saving may fall because of individuals' attempts to increase their saving, and, broadly speaking, that increase in saving may be harmful to an economy. Both the narrow and broad claims are paradoxical within the assumption underlying the fallacy of composition, namely that what {{is true of the}} parts must be true of the whole. The narrow claim transparently contradicts this assumption, and the broad one does so by implication, because while individual thrift is generally averred to be <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> the paradox of thrift holds that collective thrift may be bad for the economy.|$|E

2500|$|Economist Alan B. Krueger {{wrote in}} 2012: [...] "The rise in {{inequality}} in the United States {{over the last}} three decades has reached the point that inequality in incomes is causing an unhealthy division in opportunities, and is a threat to our economic growth. Restoring a greater degree of fairness to the U.S. job market would be good for businesses, <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy,</b> and good for the country." [...] Krueger wrote that the significant shift in the share of income accruing to the top 1% over the 1979 to 2007 period represented nearly $1.1 trillion in annual income. Since the wealthy tend to save nearly 50% of their marginal income while the remainder of the population saves roughly 10%, other things equal this would reduce annual consumption (the largest component of GDP) by as much as 5%. Krueger wrote that borrowing likely helped many households make up for this shift, which became more difficult {{in the wake of the}} 2007–2009 recession.|$|E

5000|$|Wind {{energy is}} a source of {{renewable}} power which comes from air current flowing across the earth's surface.

Wind is a renewable energy resource, it is inexhaustible and requires no [...] "fuel" [...] besides the wind that blows across the earth; it is also beneficial <b>for</b> <b>the</b> local <b>economy</b> because <b>the</b> energy is harvested and produced locally.

Moreover, {{the community as a whole}} does not actually save money because consumers have to spend so much more on the more expensive local products.|$|E

40|$|Since {{long the}} auto {{industry}} has been a valued source of leading business cycle indicators.

The increased US market penetration by Japanese automakers coincides with a decline in the predictive ability of domestic auto returns. We are, however, able to recover a role for auto returns in business cycle forecasting by employing Japanese data. No such result can be found for European countries.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} characteristic of flood risk management in contemporary Australia is {{the tension between}} private sector land development interests and their allies who create the risk and the quite different groups, largely comprising the public sector, households and small businesses, who bear the main consequences.
