[...] Although known as an easygoing person outside of the court, Eusebio presided over it with a firm demeanor. [...] "No one got away from the court," [...] Eusebio said.

They, at least, are innocent of it all. Young lady, I'd do more for the kids than I'd do for the war--and I'll do it willingly, of my own accord. Tell me, then, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>you</b> got and I'll give you the boys' suits at cost price.

I don't know <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>you</b> have, but I don't fancy you are rolling in wealth, as you Americans say. But I do know what it costs to clear land. Suppose the government sells you Pari- Sulay at a pound an acre; clearing will cost you at least four pounds more; that is, five pounds for four hundred acres, or, say, ten thousand dollars.

6000|$|And as it {{had been}} the night before, so it was now. The Genie brought the princess, and she and Jacob Stuck feasted {{together}} until nearly midnight. Then, again, the door opened, and the beautiful servant-lad came with the tray and something upon it covered with a napkin. Jacob Stuck unfolded the napkin, and this time it was a cup made of a single ruby, and filled to the brim with gold money. And the wonder of the cup was this: that no matter <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>you</b> took out of it, it was always full. [...] "Take this," [...] said Jacob Stuck, [...] "to remind you of me." [...] Then the clock struck twelve, and instantly all was darkness, and the Genie carried the princess home again.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the devil}} (who is {{always trying to}} slander God to us) whispers to them, as he did to Eve, [...] "How unreasonable! how hard on you.

Surely God is hard on you, and grudges you pleasure. Never mind--don't be afraid. Surely you can judge best what is good for you. Surely you know your own business best. Use your own common sense and do what you like, and what you think will profit you. Are you to be a slave to old rules which your parents or the clergyman taught you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, what I'm {{going to}} say is in your interest, and you've got to believe that I have some {{authority}} for saying it. I can't tell you just how much, for I don't know as I know myself exactly. But I {{think you can get}} back if you work it right. Of course, you can't get back for nothing. It's going to cost you something. It's going to cost you all you've brought with you,"--Pinney watched Northwick's impassive face for the next change that should pass upon it; he caught it, and added--"and more. But I happen to know that the balance will be forthcoming when it's needed. I can't say how I know it, for I don't exactly know how I know it. But I do know it; and you know that it's for you to take the first step. You must say <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>you</b> brought with you, and where it is, and how it can be got at.

6000|$|... "It is my duty, Marian," [...] he said gravely, [...] "to {{speak of}} the {{statement}} you made last night. We need not allude to the painful scene which took place then: better let that rest and be forgotten as soon as possible. But the discovery {{of what you have}} been doing without my knowledge has cost me a sleepless night {{and a great deal of}} anxiety. I wish to reason with you now quite calmly and dispassionately; and I trust you will remember that I am older and have far more experience of the world than you, and that I am a better judge of your interests than you yourself can possibly be. Ahem! I have been this morning to the City, where I saw Mr. Conolly, and endeavored to make him understand the true nature of his conduct toward me--and, I may add, toward you--in working his way clandestinely into an intimacy with you. I shall not describe to you what passed; but I may say that I have found him to be a person with whom you could not hope for a day's happiness. Even apart from his habits and tastes, which are those of a mere workman, his social (and, I fear, his religious) views are such as no lady, no properly-minded woman of any class, could sympathize with. You will be better able to judge of his character when I tell you that he informed me of his having taken care, before making any advances to you, to ascertain <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>you</b> had. He boasted in the coarsest terms of his complete influence over you, evidently without a suspicion of the impression of venality and indelicacy which his words were calculated to make on me. Besides, Marian, I am sure you would not like to contract a marriage which would give me the greatest pain; which would offend my family; and which would have the effect of shutting you out from all good society." ...|$|E
