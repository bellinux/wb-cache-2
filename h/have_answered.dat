5|$|Fellow {{citizens}} & compatriots—I am besieged, by {{a thousand}} {{or more of}} the Mexicans under Santa Anna—I have sustained a continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken—I <b>have</b> <b>answered</b> the demand with a cannon shot, & our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism & everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch—The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor & that of his country—'Victory or Death.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, when no {{contestant}} had won $1 {{million in}} any show that aired {{over a period}} of five months, the top prize was then changed from a flat $1 million to an accumulating jackpot that increased by $10,000 for each episode where the top prize was not won. On April 10, 2001, Kevin Olmstead correctly answered the final question and won $2,180,000, making him the biggest winner in television history at the time. The top prize for correctly answering the final question returned to $1 million following Olmstead's win and has remained unchanged since; just five days after Olmstead's win, the standard $1 million prize was awarded to Bernie Cullen. The last top prize winner on the original network version was Ed Toutant, on the episode aired September 7, 2001; he had previously appeared on the episode aired January 31, 2001 when the jackpot was $1,860,000, where he was ruled to <b>have</b> <b>answered</b> his $16,000 question incorrectly, but when it was discovered that there was a mistake in that question, Toutant was invited back and won the $1,860,000 jackpot. On the Super Millionaire spin-off, Robert Essig won $1,000,000 after answering the twelfth question and then walked away, not reaching the final question for $10,000,000.|$|E

25|$|A {{cohort of}} 80,021 exposed people was registered, {{along with a}} control group, a cohort of 15,931 people from areas not exposed to MIC. Nearly every year since 1986, they <b>have</b> <b>answered</b> the same questionnaire. It shows overmortality and overmorbidity in the exposed group. Bias and {{confounding}} factors cannot be excluded from the study. Because of migration and other factors, 75% of the cohort is lost, as the ones who moved out are not followed.|$|E

Of Spanish heritage, Diego, described as a handsome and brave soldier who fought for Charles V's army in the Algiers expedition, was a published poet, member of the Florentine Academy and well connected to the power structure in Naples being a protégé of Viceroy Pedro de Toledo. Perhaps encouraged and helped by her tutor, Isabella and Diego began a secret correspondence, when he began to send her letters in the name of his wife with some poems enclosed, to which Isabella might <b>have</b> <b>answered.</b>|$|E
25|$|SOA administers exam MLC, {{which covers}} life {{contingencies}} topics. Starting in May 2014, MLC includes both multiple choice and open-response questions. SOA made this change because, in their view, strict multiple-choice questions {{are not sufficient}} or adequate to test whether the candidates are familiar and fluent in the material. The test is four-hours long, allows calculators, and is administered via a paper-and-pencil format. Multiple choice questions account for 40% of the exam, and open-response questions account for 60% of the exam. Candidates may freely move between the two sections. The two sections are graded separately. However, since the multiple-choice questions are easier, only candidates who <b>have</b> <b>answered</b> {{a certain percentage of}} the multiple-choice questions correctly have their written answers graded.|$|E

A memoir of Romney was written by his brother John and published in 1830, in which John describes dissuading George from buying four acres of land on Edgware Road on which to build a house, which John feared would be [...] "attended with more expense than his limited circumstance would allow." [...] Romney was instead persuaded to buy the house on Holly Bush Hill and add a [...] "gallery and painting-room at small expense."

500|$|Fort Lipantitlán {{was built}} on the grounds of an old {{campsite}} along {{the west bank of the}} Nueces River on the Gulf coast of Texas. [...] The site was first occupied by a nomadic Lipan Apache tribe during their periodic visits. [...] After the Apaches abandoned the area, the campground was often used by missionaries, military units, and traders making their way between Mexico and the Texas settlements. [...] In 1825 or 1826, Mexican officials constructed a makeshift fort, named Lipantitlán after the Lipan Apaches, at the campsite. [...] According to Texian John J. Linn, the fort [...] "was a single embankment of earth, lined within by fence rails to hold the dirt in place, and would <b>have</b> <b>answered</b> tolerably well, perhaps, for a second-rate hog pen". The embankment was surrounded by a large ditch; just outside the ditch lay adobe and wooden huts for the officers and their families.|$|E
500|$|The Federalist {{articles}} {{appeared in}} three New York newspapers: The Independent Journal, the New-York Packet, and the Daily Advertiser, beginning on October 27, 1787. Although written and published with haste, The Federalist articles were widely read and greatly influenced {{the shape of}} American political institutions. Between them, Hamilton, Madison and Jay kept up a rapid pace, with at times three or four new essays by Publius appearing in the papers in a week. Garry Wills observes that the pace of production [...] "overwhelmed" [...] any possible response: [...] "Who, given ample time could <b>have</b> <b>answered</b> such a battery of arguments? And no time was given." [...] Hamilton also encouraged the reprinting of the essay in newspapers outside New York state, and indeed they were published in several other states where the ratification debate was taking place. However, they were only irregularly published outside New York, and {{in other parts of}} the country they were often overshadowed by local writers.|$|E

2500|$|Anand {{played a}} sharp line against the Nimzo-Indian Defence {{that gave him}} attacking chances. Instead of 20.axb4, which {{according}} to Hikaru Nakamura [...] "was not {{in the spirit of}} the position at all", either 20.a4 or 20.f5 were suggested as more promising continuations for White. Afterwards, Carlsen defended accurately, creating counterplay on the queenside, and ultimately queening his b-pawn with check while Anand was shifting his heavy pieces over to his mating attack. Anand should <b>have</b> <b>answered</b> 27...b1=Q+ with 28.Bf1. ChessBase gives the best line as 28.Bf1 Qd1 29.Rh4 Qh5 (Black must sacrifice his new queen in order to stave off checkmate) 30.Nxh5 gxh5 31.Rxh5 Bf5 32.Bh3 Bg6 33.e6 Nxf6 34.gxf6 Qxf6 35.Rf5 Qxe6 36.Re5 Qd6, which is probably a draw. Instead, Anand blundered with 28.Nf1 and resigned after 28...Qe1, since after 29.Rh4 Qxh4 30.Qxh4, Black emerges a rook up.|$|E
