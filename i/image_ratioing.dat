40|$|Many land-cover change {{detection}} {{techniques have}} been developed; however, different {{conclusions about the}} value or appropriateness of each exist. This difference of opinion is often influenced by the landscape complexity of study areas and data used for analysis. Which method is most suitable for land-cover change detection in Amazon tropical regions remains unclear. ln this paper, 10 binary change detection methods were implemented and compared {{with respect to their}} capability to detect land-cover change and no change conditions in moist tropical regions. They are image differencing (ID), modified image differencing (MID), a combination of image differencing and principal component analysis (IDPCA), principal component differencing (PCD), multitemporal PCA (MPCA), change vector analysis (CVA), vegetation index differencing (VID), <b>image</b> <b>ratioing</b> (IR), modified <b>image</b> <b>ratioing</b> (MIR), and a combination of <b>image</b> <b>ratioing</b> and PCA (lRPCA). Multi-temporal Thematic Mapper (TM) data were used to conduct land-cover binary change detection.

Computer preprocessing techniques applied to the digital images to improve the final classification results were geometric corrections, spectral band or <b>image</b> <b>ratioing</b> and statistical cleaning of the representative training sets. A minimal level of statistical verification was made based upon the comparisons between the airphoto estimates and the classification results.

40|$|Video-based facial {{expression}} recognition is a challenging problem in computer vision and human-computer interaction. To target this problem, texture features have been extracted and widely used, {{because they can}} capture image intensity changes raised by skin deformation. However, existing texture features encounter problems with albedo and lighting variations. To solve both problems, we propose a new texture feature called <b>image</b> <b>ratio</b> features. Compared with previously proposed texture features, e. g., high gradient component features, <b>image</b> <b>ratio</b> features are more robust to albedo and lighting variations. In addition, to further improve {{facial expression}} recognition accuracy based on <b>image</b> <b>ratio</b> features, we combine <b>image</b> <b>ratio</b> features with facial animation parameters (FAPs), which describe the geometric motions of facial feature points. The performance evaluation {{is based on the}} Carnegie Mellon University Cohn-Kanade database, our own database, and the Japanese Female Facial Expression database. Experimental results show that the proposed <b>image</b> <b>ratio</b> feature is more robust to albedo and lighting variations, and the combination of <b>image</b> <b>ratio</b> features and FAPs outperforms each feature alone. In addition, we study asymmetric facial expressions based on our own facial expression database and demonstrate the superior performance of our combined expression recognition system...|$|R

We implement and compare several techniques which vary in complexity. Among the simple methods that are implemented are differencing, Euclidean distance, and <b>image</b> <b>ratioing.</b> These methods require minimal processing time, with little computational complexity, and incorporate no statistical information. We also implemented methods which incorporate second order statistic calculations in making a change decision in efforts to mitigate false alarms arising from the speckle noise, misregistration errors, and nonlinear variations in SAR images. These methods include a Wiener prediction-based method, Mahalanobis distance measure and subspace projection method. We compare the performance of these methods using multilook SAR images containing several targets (mines). We present results in the form of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves...|$|E

More specifically it looks into the optimization of reshold values for these investigated change detection techniques: image differencing, normalized image differencing, <b>image</b> <b>ratioing,</b> normalized variance differencing, normalized spectral Euclidean distance and Tasseled Cap parameters difference. The threshold values were optimized for the detection of land cover change/nochange based on the comparison with an existing validated classification of five broad land cover classes. For this study a sample set of 104 image pairs was selected, each of 20 x 20 km, cut from Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery series. An object based approach was applied for the land cover change detection. The results showed that the threshold of normalized variance difference had most stable values across the sample set, however applying optimized thresholds the achieved accuracy was comparable for all tested methods.

40|$|A {{technique}} is described which enables quantitative histological {{data to be}} recovered from conventional digital images. Methodology is developed around the concept of <b>image</b> <b>ratios,</b> which are shown to be invariant to scene geometry and illumination intensity. Key {{to the success of}} this technique, is a function which maps uniquely from a vector if <b>image</b> <b>ratios</b> to the corresponding vector of histological parameters. The existence of this function is established using mathematical techniques drawn from differential geometry. The methodology is formulated generally then applied to a two-parameter model of human skin. A function relating <b>image</b> <b>ratios</b> to concentrations of melanin and blood is established and used to process a standard RGB image. The technique successfully maps out the distribution of blood and melanin across the entire image. As light optical radiation propagates through skin it is both scattered and absorbed. Scattering primarily occurs from the underlying tissue structure whilst absorption tends to result from the tissue pigments.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{detection}} of changes using hyperspectral images. Change Detection (CD) {{is the process of}} identifying and examining temporal and spectral changes in signals. Detection and analysis of change provide valuable information of possible transformations in a scene. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) sensors are capable of collecting data at hundreds of narrow spectral bands. Such sensors provide high-resolution spatial and spectrally rich information that can be exploited for CD. This work develops and implements various CD algorithms for detection of changes using Hyperspectral images. The main objectives are to study and develop different HSI change detection algorithms. The explored methods were implemented in order to compare the performance on close-in HSI data. The methods studied in this thesis include, Image Differencing, <b>Image</b> <b>Ratioing,</b> Principal Component Analysis, Linear Chronochrome, a modified Correlation Coefficient and a Kernel Dissimilarity Measure. Hyperspectral imagery of different scenarios was collected and used to test and validate the methods presented in this study.

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. The production of <b>ratio</b> <b>images</b> from multispectral scanner data is described and several examples of <b>ratio</b> <b>images</b> from aircraft and ERTS- 1 data are given for visible, reflective infrared, and thermal infrared wavelengths. The application of photogrammetric techniques to <b>ratio</b> <b>images,</b> defined for this paper as ratio scannergrammetry, is considerably {{aided by the}} lesser dependence of <b>ratio</b> <b>images</b> on atmospheric and solar illumination variations, compared with single channel scanner imagery or aerial photos. Ratio scannergrammetry is further aided by the proportionality between ratios of a target deduced from <b>ratio</b> <b>images</b> and <b>ratios</b> of reflectances calculated from laboratory spectra of samples from the target area. Consequently, ratios calculated from laboratory data {{can be used to}} predict which ratios are best for discriminating a given rock or mineral, to predict what other rocks or minerals will be confused with it, and finally, to place ratio scannergrammetry on an absolute basis, within an estimated standard error on the order of 5 % to 10 %.

40|$|We {{conduct a}} {{thorough}} study of photometric stereo under nearby point light source illumination, from modeling to numerical solution, through calibration. In the classical formulation of photometric stereo, the luminous fluxes {{are assumed to}} be directional, which is very difficult to achieve in practice. Rather, we use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to illuminate the scene to reconstruct. Such point light sources are very convenient to use, yet they yield a more complex photometric stereo model which is arduous to solve. We first derive in a physically sound manner this model, and show how to calibrate its parameters. Then, we discuss two state-of-the-art numerical solutions. The first one alternatingly estimates the albedo and the normals, and then integrates the normals into a depth map. It is shown empirically to be independent from the initialization, but convergence of this sequential approach is not established. The second one directly recovers the depth, by formulating photometric stereo as a system of PDEs which are partially linearized using <b>image</b> <b>ratios.</b> Although the sequential approach is avoided, initialization matters a lot and convergence is not established either. Therefore, we introduce a provably convergent alternating reweighted least-squares scheme for solving the original system of PDEs, without resorting to <b>image</b> <b>ratios</b> for linearization.

40|$|We {{address the}} issue of {{anomalous}} <b>image</b> flux <b>ratios</b> seen in the double-image gravitational lens JVAS B 0218 + 357. From the multi-frequency observations presented in a recent study (Mittal et al. 2006) and several previous observations made by other authors, the anomaly is well-established in that the <b>image</b> flux-density <b>ratio</b> (A/B) decreases from 3. 9 to 2. 0 over the observed frequency range from 15 GHz to 1. 65 GHz. In Mittal et al. (2006), the authors investigated whether an interplay between a frequency-dependent structure of the background radio-source and a gradient in the relative image-magnification can explain away the anomaly. Insufficient shifts in the image centroids with frequency led them to discard the above effect as the cause of the anomaly. In this paper, we first take this analysis further by evaluating the combined effect of the background source extension and magnification gradients in the lens plane in more detail. This is done by making a direct use of the observed VLBI flux-distributions for each image to estimate the <b>image</b> flux-density <b>ratios</b> at different frequencies from a lens-model. As a result of this investigation, this mechanism does not account for the anomaly. Following this, we analyze the effects of mechanisms which are non-gravitational in nature on the <b>image</b> flux <b>ratios</b> in B 0218 + 357. These are free-free absorption and scattering, and are assumed to occur under the hypothesis of a molecular cloud residing in the lens galaxy along the line-of-sight to image A.
