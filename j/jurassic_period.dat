5|$|Limusaurus is {{the first}} {{definite}} ceratosaur from eastern Asia to be discovered. It {{is also one of}} the earliest members of the group Ceratosauria, living during the Oxfordian stage of the <b>Jurassic</b> <b>period</b> (approximately 161-157 million years ago). Its discovery shows that the Asian dinosaurian fauna was less endemic during the Middle/Late <b>Jurassic</b> <b>period</b> than previously thought, and suggests a possible land connection between Asia and other continents during that period.|$|E

5|$|In clade-based phylogenetic taxonomy, Ceratopsia {{is often}} defined {{to include all}} marginocephalians {{more closely related to}} Triceratops than to Pachycephalosaurus. Under this definition, the most basal known ceratopsians are Yinlong, from the Late <b>Jurassic</b> <b>Period,</b> along with Chaoyangsaurus and the family Psittacosauridae, from the Early Cretaceous Period, all of which were {{discovered}} in northern China or Mongolia. The rostral bone and flared jugals are already present in all of these forms, indicating that even earlier ceratopsians remain to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} most of these fossils were the coastal cliffs around Lyme Regis, part of a {{geological}} formation known as the Blue Lias. This consists of alternating layers of limestone and shale, laid down as sediment on a shallow seabed early in the <b>Jurassic</b> <b>period</b> (about 210–195million years ago). It {{is one of the}} richest fossil locations in Britain. The cliffs could be dangerously unstable, however, especially in winter when rain caused landslides. It was precisely during the winter months that collectors were drawn to the cliffs because the landslides often exposed new fossils.|$|E

5|$|Geologically, West Antarctica {{closely resembles}} the Andes {{mountain}} range of South America. The Antarctic Peninsula {{was formed by}} uplift and metamorphism of sea bed sediments during the late Paleozoic and the early Mesozoic eras. This sediment uplift was accompanied by igneous intrusions and volcanism. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are andesite and rhyolite volcanics formed during the <b>Jurassic</b> <b>period.</b> There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in Marie Byrd Land and Alexander Island. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the Ellsworth Mountains region, where the stratigraphy is more similar to East Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Scelidosaurus lived {{during the}} Early <b>Jurassic</b> <b>Period,</b> during the Sinemurian to Pliensbachian stages around 191million years ago. This genus and related genera {{at the time}} lived on the supercontinent Laurasia. Its fossils have been found near Charmouth in Dorset, England, and {{are known for their}} {{excellent}} preservation. Scelidosaurus has been called the earliest complete dinosaur. It is the most completely known dinosaur of the British Isles. Scelidosaurus is currently the only classified dinosaur found in Ireland. Despite this, a modern description is still lacking. After initial finds in the 1850s, comparative anatomist Richard Owen named and described Scelidosaurus in 1859. Only one species, Scelidosaurus harrisonii named by Owen in 1861, is considered valid today, although one other species was proposed in 1996.|$|E

5|$|The {{sandstone}} formations {{from which}} Silver Reef gets its name were formed when tectonic stresses forced long, longitudinally aligned sections of Navajo Sandstone to buckle and {{stand on their}} sides, giving them the appearance of ocean reefs. Over {{long periods of time}} silver ore, sediments, and vegetation were carried in water runoff from the Chinle Formation to the White, Buckeye, and East reefs. The ore settled as deposits and the vegetation became petrified. The Silver Reef Mining District's geologic resources consist mainly of silver deposits, with smaller deposits of copper, gold, lead, and uranium oxide. Iron oxide deposits in the soil rocks cause a red coloration, and dinosaur tracks from the early <b>Jurassic</b> <b>period</b> have been found in the area.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, the {{estimated}} number of dinosaur species {{that existed in}} the Mesozoic era was estimated to be 1,543–2,468. Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous, including seed-eaters, fish-eaters, insectivores, and omnivores. While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal (as are all modern birds), some prehistoric species were quadrupeds, and others, such as Ammosaurus and Iguanodon, could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits, and some extinct species had bony armor. Although known for large size, many Mesozoic dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller, and modern birds are generally small in size. Dinosaurs today inhabit every continent, and fossils show that they had achieved global distribution by at least the early <b>Jurassic</b> <b>period.</b> Modern birds inhabit most available habitats, from terrestrial to marine, and there is evidence that some non-avian dinosaurs (such as Microraptor) could fly or at least glide, and others, such as spinosaurids, had semi-aquatic habits.|$|E
5|$|It {{lived in}} what is now {{southern}} Germany in the Late <b>Jurassic</b> <b>period</b> around 150million years ago, when Europe was an archipelago in a shallow warm tropical sea, much closer to the equator than it is now. Similar in shape to a European magpie, with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a raven, Archaeopteryx could grow to about 0.5metres (1.6ft) in length. Despite its small size, broad wings, and inferred ability to fly or glide, Archaeopteryx has more in common with other small Mesozoic dinosaurs than it does with modern birds. In particular, it shares the following features with the deinonychosaurs (dromaeosaurs and troodontids): jaws with sharp teeth, three fingers with claws, a long bony tail, hyperextensible second toes ("killing claw"), feathers (which suggest homeothermy), and various skeletal features. These features make Archaeopteryx a clear candidate for a transitional fossil between dinosaurs and birds, making it important in the study both of dinosaurs and of the origin of birds.|$|E

5|$|Living {{in what is}} now Europe, {{during the}} <b>Jurassic</b> <b>Period</b> (~201 to ~145 million years ago), Megalosaurus may have hunted stegosaurs and sauropods. Repeated {{descriptions}} during the nineteenth and early twentieth century of Megalosaurus hunting Iguanodon (another of the earliest dinosaurs named) through the forests that then covered the continent are now known to be inaccurate, because Iguanodon skeletons are found in much younger Early Cretaceous formations. The only specimens belonging to Megalosaurus bucklandii are from the Lower/Middle Bathonian of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire. No material from outside of the Bathonian formations of England can be referred to Megalosaurus. It lived alongside the theropods Cruxicheiros, Iliosuchus and Streptospondylus, and the sauropods Cardiodon, Cetiosaurus, and possibly Cetiosauriscus. The pterosaur Rhamphocephalus, and indeterminate sauropod and ornithopod remains have also been found alongside fossils of Megalosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Quarries of {{the local}} blue lias stone were worked from {{as early as the}} 12th century {{to the end of the}} 19th century. It is a {{geological}} formation in southern England, part of the Lias Group. The Blue Lias consists of a sequence of limestone and shale layers, laid down in latest Triassic and early Jurassic times, between 195 and 200 million years ago. Its age corresponds to the Rhaetian to lower Sinemurian stages of the geologic timescale, thus fully including the Hettangian stage. It is the lowest of the three divisions of the Lower <b>Jurassic</b> <b>period</b> and, as such, is also given the name Lower Lias. It consists of thin blue argillaceous, or clay-like, limestone. The Blue Lias contains many fossils, especially ammonites. Fossils discovered in the lias include many ichthyosaurs, one of which has been adopted as the badge of Street. There is a display of Street fossils in the Natural History Museum in London.|$|E
5|$|The Morrison Formation is a {{sequence}} of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which, according to radiometric dating, dates from between 156.3mya at its base, and 146.8mya at the top, placing it in the late Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the Late <b>Jurassic</b> <b>period.</b> This formation is interpreted as originating in a locally semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin, where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan; it was formed when the precursors to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels, and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the Lourinhã Formation in Portugal and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania.|$|E
