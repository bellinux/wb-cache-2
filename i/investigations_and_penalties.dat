40|$|Although the {{protection}} of economic competition is a public interest, its restrictions {{have a negative impact}} on both the market that is being protected, as well as its consumers. While damages to the market and the general interest are protected through administrative <b>investigations</b> <b>and</b> <b>penalties,</b> damages caused to competitors, as a result of the noncompliance with rules of public character, are protected through tort law actions. To determine whether liability arises from the noncompliance with competition rules, it is necessary to analyze the different elements of such liability. Some competition law rules have an objective dimension (intended to safeguard public interests) and a subjective dimension (intended to safeguard private interests). Damages caused by the implementation of anticompetitive business practices is a case of liability for its own act (trader’s activity), which should be analyzed under a subjective system of liability. However, the noncompliance to competition laws, which also protects the public interest dimension of the competition, carries the fault element. In this case, the only option for the defendant is to prove if his/her conduct fits into an exemption, or prove that it was an invincible mistake. </p...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the record of}} two state agencies within the California Department of Industrial Relations, the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) and the California Occupational Safety and Health Program (Cal/OSHA), over the 1970 - 2000 period. Although the data available {{on the performance of}} these agencies are severely limited - in most cases consisting only of enforcement activity measures, without any valid measures of enforcement outcomes, it is possible to draw some conclusions. The analysis shows that the agencies' budget and staffing allocations have generally not kept pace with the growth {{in the size of the}} state's workforce, nor with the agencies' increased responsibilities. Despite recent improvements, the agencies are still funded and staffed at 1989 levels. Moreover, several key activity measures, such as the number of <b>investigations,</b> citations, <b>and</b> <b>penalties</b> assessed, have failed to increase in proportion to the expansion of funding and staffing that has occurred. The chapter highlights the urgent need for these agencies to collect data on outcomes, so that any future progress in their work can be measured and evaluated in a rigorous manner...|$|R

DOJ appears to be conducting its three national initiatives consistent with the guidance. U. S.

Representatives from the American Hospital Association and the state hospital associations GAO spoke to were generally satisfied that U. S.

40|$|Competition {{authorities}} {{carry out}} <b>investigations</b> <b>and</b> impose legal <b>penalties</b> on firms which are caught infringing the competition law. The rationale {{of this policy}} is to prevent firms from distorting free competition {{in a way that}} is detrimental to economic efficiency and at the same time to deter them from engaging in cartels and other anti-competitive behaviour. In this paper I try to evaluate the impact of major antitrust & abuse of dominant position investigations on firm’s financial value. For this purpose I divide the period of each investigation into two sub periods: the ‘Investigation period”, which begins from the outset of the anticompetitive case and ends when the competition authority issues the statement of objections to the infringed firms and the ‘Deterrence period’, which follows the ‘Investigation period’ and ends with the final judgment of the court. I use aggregate regression based approach to estimate the Average & Cumulative Average Residuals of the firms which infringe articles 1 & 2 of Greek Competition Law. The empirical results imply that the release of the final decisions of the Hellenic Competition Commission and the Court of Appeal negatively affect the share price of the infringed firms. ...|$|R
40|$|According to Mann, {{the state}} {{infrastructure}} power is "the institutional {{capacity of a}} central state, despotic or not, to penetrate its territories and logistically implement decisions. " From the perspective of state-building, this paper investigates the change of the state infrastructure power from the Maoist time to the Post-Mao period with the case study of the Industrial and Commercial Administrative Office (ICAO) in Guang Zhou city. The paper illustrates the following three arguments. First, different from the perspectives which focus on the change of the authoritarian or communist factors in China, the state-building studies give us fresh perspective to outline the change of the state infrastructure power from the Maoist time to the Post-Mao period. In the case study of the ICAO in Guang Zhou city, the state fell short of fiscal revenue to finance the ICAO. The self-supply funding system of the ICAO hindered the formalization of the ICAO and rendered the ICAO to pursue revenue increase, {{which led to the}} arbitrary charges of the market management fee and distorted the function of the ICAO. Since 1990 s, the state tried to check the ICAO's orientation of pursuing revenue increase by launching reforms to change the funding system of the ICAO and promoting the institution-building of it. Despite the limitation of the reform measures, the state enhanced its agent-monitoring capacity under the circumstance of disappearance of political movement and ideological bindings. Second, the state-building effort of the rulers, the shortage of the fiscal revenue and the path-dependence are three outstanding factors which influence the change of the state infrastructure power from the Maoist time to the Post-Mao era. In the case of ICAO, the rulers takes efforts to extend their power to penetrate the society and monitor their agents. In order to achieve the objective of market control, the rulers established the ICAO and tried to enhance the agent-monitoring capacity. The shortage of the fiscal revenue baffled the rulers efforts to widely set up ICAO and restricted the formalization of it. Furthermore, the path dependence impacts {{on the development of the}} state infrastructure power. When the self-supply funding system of the ICAO was established, new problems and resistance arose from the funding system prevent the rulers to reform it. Third, the state infrastructure power influences the relationship between the state and society. The state infrastructure power not only shapes how the ICAO deals with different market subjects, it also works on the coping strategies different market subjects take to protect themselves from the <b>investigation</b> <b>and</b> <b>penalty</b> of the ICAO. By taking the social control capacity and agent-monitoring capacity of the state into consideration, we could better understand the interaction between the ICAO and different market subjects. 黃冬婭.

40|$|In this {{theoretical}} analysis, the"principal"can be {{the head}} of the tax collection agency (or"government"or even citizens), the"supervisor"can be the tax collector, and the"agent"can be the taxpayer. The principal, interested in controlling an agent's socially costly activity ("cheating"), hires the supervisor to save on monitoring costs. The agent may bribe the tax collector to suppress reporting, but bribery can be eliminated by the agency head if he institutes enough <b>investigations</b> <b>and</b> sets rewards high enough <b>and</b> <b>penalties</b> steep enough. When <b>penalties</b> <b>and</b> rewards are constrained, some corruption will exist even under a rational approach to pursuing the agency's objectives. Anti-corruption efforts will have higher costs than benefits unless they successfully address these constraints. The agency's implementation costs, and thus the scope for corruption, are defined by constraints on <b>penalties</b> <b>and</b> rewards relative to costs of monitoring <b>and</b> <b>investigation.</b> For example, if the agency head is extremely handicapped in his ability to detect bribery (by a high burden of proof <b>and</b> cost of <b>investigation,</b> <b>and</b> a civil service pay scale that is too flat and rigid), he cannot really reward good employees or make dishonest employees suffer. The analysis assumes that the principal can commit in advance to a certain likelihood of being caught engaging in bribery. Creating an independent anti-corruption commission (like those in Hong Kong and New South Wales) may be interpreted as a way of making such a commitment. In Hong Kong two-thirds of reports to the commission are made in full name, an indication that it has attained a reputation for independence and efficiency. The"whistleblower act"in the United states (promising rewards and protection for informants), as well as separation of powers and independent courts, also function as commitment. Corruption exists not only in poorly designed but also in sophisticated systems. It can profitably be reduced only by improving general incentives. Advances in courts, investigations, freedom of the press, and flow of information can allow more performance-based rewards <b>and</b> <b>penalties.</b> Environmental Economics&Policies,Economic Theory&Research,Corruption&Anitcorruption Law,Public Sector Corruption&Anticorruption Measures,Banks&Banking Reform...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "U. S. agencies engaged in export controls use various compliance activities to prevent the diversion or misuse of exported items against U. S. interests or allies and reduce illicit transshipment risk. Compliance activities include (1) vetting transactions prior to export, (2) analyzing shipping data and monitoring the end use of items, and (3) educating companies and foreign governments about illicit transshipment risks. To vet transactions, agencies review license applications for the export of controlled items, consult multiple lists of entities known or suspected of violating export control laws or regulations, and screen foreign end users to determine their eligibility to receive items without a license. Agencies also review shipping records to identify patterns of abuse and to plan end-use checksvisiting foreign companies to verify the approved use and location of exported items on both licensed items and those eligible for export without a license. From 2008 to 2010, Commerce conducted 56 percent of its end-use checks on unlicensed exports. In the 13 transshipment countries, unlicensed exports accounted for about 94 percent of unfavorable end-use check determinations, which indicates that the end use or end user of an export were not appropriate. For example, some unlicensed items transshipped illicitly to Iran through Hong Kong were used to build improvised explosive devices used against Coalition troops in Iraq. When an unfavorable determination is made, the Department of Commerce (Commerce) or Department of State (State) may take further action, such as denying a license or referring involved entities to enforcement agencies for <b>investigation</b> <b>and</b> possible <b>penalties.</b> To educate U. S. companies and foreign governments about illicit transshipment risks, Commerce and State review the internal controls of companies compliance programs; conduct outreach to U. S. companies to inform exporters of their responsibilities to comply with export control laws and regulations; and provide training to foreign governments. ...|$|R
