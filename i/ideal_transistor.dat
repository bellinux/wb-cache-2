No current flows into the gate or base which is represented by Y. There is no base-emitter or gate-source voltage drop, so the emitter or source voltage (at X) follows the voltage at Y. The gate or base has an infinite input impedance (Y), while the emitter or source has a zero input impedance (X). Any current out of the emitter or source (X) is reflected at the collector or drain (Z) as a current in, but with an infinite output impedance. Because of this reversal of sense between X and Z currents, this ideal bipolar or field-effect transistor represents a CCII−. If current flowing out of X resulted in the same high-impedance current flowing out of Z, it would be a CCII+.|$|E
5000|$|The goal of many {{laboratories}} {{around the}} world is creating semiconductors that can operate faster than current technology. Specifically, electrons within the transistor will be able to actively travel with no collisions. [...] Research shows that with low velocities come unstable electron flow. Thus, when the electrons have a high velocity and long distance over which they can remain ballistic, then {{they will be able to}} travel through semiconductor material without being scattered. Currently, the silicon Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) is the main and leading research circuit. However, researchers predict that finding the ideal semiconductor will increase the dimensions of the transistor, even greater than the current silicon. In the early 1960s, there has been speculation that replacing the silicon with metal would increase the energy barrier between electrons and the semiconductor. Scientists now are also currently trying to improve two aspects of the standard transistor. The first is the common emitter, which is an amplifier used as a reference point between the point and collector. Scientists are trying to reduce the width of the emitter, in belief that it would increase the speed of electrons. The second is the base of the transistor. Scientists are trying to make the base as thin as possible, even as thin as 70 nanometers, so that there is a less travel length and time for the electrons through the base. When a device exceeds its permitted power consumption, there will be a leakage current. The <b>ideal</b> <b>transistor</b> should maintain a low to no leakage current. In order for this to happen, the device will have to operate in low temperatures, again meaning that it will have to use very little power.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{distributed amplifier}} offers broad bandwidth but has low efficiency since {{half of the}} FET output power is wasted in an idle termination, and {{only one of the}} FETs is fully utilised. Further, such amplifiers are normally operated in the class-A mode which has an inherently low efficiency. The single-ended dual-fed distributed amplifier (SE-DFDA) [1] allows all the FET output power to be utilised. The work of Moazzam and Aitchison [1] only considered single-FET SE-DFDAs. The SE-DFDA concept can be extended to N FETs, and if the FETs are spaced 180 ", all FETs have identical loadlines, which can be chosen optimally [2]. The SE-DFDA therefore allows efficient power combining of FET output power without using bulky multi-way power combiners [2]. In the previous work on the power SE-DFDA, class-A [2] and class-B [3] operation was demonstrated. A class-F amplifier [4] can offer both high output power and high efficiency (up to 100 % for <b>ideal</b> <b>transistors).</b> To date, the developments reported in the literature pertaining to class-F amplifiers have essentially only considered single transistor amplifiers.

40|$|Abstract- Due to Technology scaling the {{importance}} of leakage power has significantly increased in the modern day system-on-chip devices. The runtime leakage component during the active state is almost becoming equal to the standby leakage component. Hence Present day research is more focused on reduction of runtime leakage current. we present a novel runtime leakage reduction for 70 nm technology. As an attempt to save the leakage power in the active mode, run-time power gating is explored at various design levels. In the present work we propose a power control method based on Transient Time Slot (TTS) of a logic gate. Using static timing analysis, for each logic gate of the circuit we find its idle period (non-transition period) within the clock period. We switch off the power supply during that period which saves significant amount of run time leakage power. The Logic gates are partitioned according to a heuristic algorithm proposed into clusters so that pair of control transistors is attached to each cluster. Power is supplied only during Transient Time Slot. We simulated ISCAC’ 85 bench mark circuits and observed that there is significant amount of run time leakage saved.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{different}} driver topologies for RF Doherty {{power amplifiers}} (DPAs). The investigation {{is based on}} the simulation of four different driver configurations in Matlab and Advanced Design Systems (ADS) tools. The topologies of the two-stage PA are as follows: (1) cascaded class-AB and a DPA, (2) two-stage cascaded DPAs, (3) DPA with embedded class-ABs and (4) DPA with embedded Dohertys as drivers. Using <b>ideal</b> <b>transistor</b> models, the analysis of the different two-stage power amplifier topologies have been compared through Matlab simulations. The results show that the two-stage cascaded DPA provide the best performance since its efficiency in back-off is higher than the other topologies. To verify the Matlab simulations, the different topologies have been designed and simulated in ADS using real transistor models. The driver and final-stage designed based on 10 W (CGH 40010 F) and 45 W (CGH 40045 F) GaN-HEMT transistors from Cree devices respectively. The required fundamental source and load impedances are obtained from the source- and load-pull simulations. Moreover, the second and third harmonic terminations have been simulated and tuned {{in order to get the}} highest possible Power- Added Efficiency (PAE). These amplifiers have made the basis to simulate the four different two-stage power amplifier efficiencies. The ADS simulation results are in good agreement with the Matlab simulations and confirm that the two-stage cascaded DPAs outperforms the other topologies in term of efficiency. All four different topologies have been designed in band-I (2. 11 - 2. 17 GHz). The two-stage cascaded Doherty PA exhibits the highest PAE. It consists of the Doherty driver-stage that exhibits a peak output power of 42 dBm, a power gain of 13 dB, a PAE of 60 % at 6 dB back-off and 74 % at peak output power. The Doherty-final-stage has 58 % PAE at 6 -dB back-off and a peak PAE of 73 %. Its power gain and peak output power are 12 dB and 50 dBm, respectively. The simulation results of the two-stage-cascaded DPA provides 26 dB power gain at 50 dBm peak output power, a PAE of 58 % at 6 -dB back-off and 73 % PAE. The desired topology (2) exhibits 3 % and 5 % more PAE comparing to the topology (1) and (3) at 6 -dB output back-off respectively. In addition it has about 3 % more PAE comparing to the topology (4) at the peak output power. Regarding to the total gain, topology (1) has the highest gain. However, topology (4) has a very flat gain of 30. 5 - 31. 5 dB over Pout = 34 - 49. 5 dBm which can result in a more linear behavior. The obtained results demonstrate the importance of the driver topology on total efficiency of the two-stage power amplifiers when signals with large PAPR are used...|$|E
40|$|Field effect {{transistors}} (FETs) are {{indispensable for}} our modern digital society, needed as basic {{building blocks for}} logical gates in all digital circuits. FETs are found in sample and hold circuits with high storage capacities and high write and read speeds and in driver circuits for active matrix displays such as large area TVs. An entire new application perspective is currently emerging {{in the area of}} printed electronics, where flexible plastic foils, papers and textiles become inexpensive substrates for novel devices. To realize circuits on such substrates, dielectrics, semiconductors and conductors with suitable morphologies as well as innovative device architectures have to be developed. Prominent among others, printed liquid electrolytes with high gate capacities in combination with printed oxide semiconductors have yielded good device performance and remarkable drain currents at low gate voltages. To be usable in everyday applications basic requirements have to be fulfilled, such as functional stability during environmental temperature changes, sufficient current output to drive more advanced electronic circuits, high switching speed and miniaturized size to allow for large packing densities. Miniaturized high current transistors with good temperature stability can open the path to many new applications for printed electronics, e. g., wearable electronics or lighting solutions, where higher currents are necessary. In this thesis in-plane indium oxide based FETs have been fabricated utilizing composite solid polymer electrolytes (CSPEs) for gating. Different CSPEs have been investigated to determine the most suitable candidate for high performance FETs concerning chemical, physical and electrical behavior. The CSPE, containing LiClO 4, PVA, PC and DMSO, has been selected and printed onto an in-plane electrolyte-gated FET (EG-FET). Special attention has been drawn to the key parameters of the EG-FET like mobility, on-current, on/off-current ratio and threshold voltage tested over a wide temperature range. Especially the temperature independence of the on-current and the threshold voltage as well as the absence of hysteresis turn out to be beneficial with respect to future applicability of printed EG-FETs in electrical circuits. In order to downsize the in-plane EG-FETs and to obtain large drain currents at the same time, a vertical arrangement of the FET (v-FET) has been realized. In order to achieve this goal, SnO 2 has been stacked in between two platinum electrodes to achieve the vertical source/semiconductor/drain structure, in plane with the platinum gate. The gating is realized by ink-jet printing a CSPE film covering the semiconductor channel and the gate. The CSPE, infiltrated into the porous semiconductor network, addresses the entire inner surface of the semiconductor. A channel of 45 nm is achieved by utilizing the thickness of the printed semiconductor film. A device using such geometry yields nearly <b>ideal</b> <b>transistor</b> characteristics with a clear current saturation with increasing drain voltage and a quadratic increase of the output curves with increasing gate voltage. The large drain current densities exceeding 0. 1 MA/cm 2 {{can be explained by the}} large channel area or channel width, which can be modeled by a large number of independent pillars forming conducting pathways between source to drain electrode. Finally, the problem of limited switching speeds of an in-plane EG-FET has been addressed. The limiting factor for such devices is clearly the large gate-to-channel distance, which limits the time to form the FET conducting channel. The characteristic time constant is determined by the ionic conductivity of the CSPE and double layer capacitance of the CSPE/semiconductor interface. In order to reduce the gate-to-channel distance, i. e., the total resistance, a back-gated EG-FET has been designed using a porous AlOx spacer with a thickness of about 300 nm and a SnO 2 layer as the channel material. Due to the reduction of the gate-to-channel distance by more than two orders of magnitude a potential reduction of the the switching frequency can be shown...|$|E

Despite the remarkable performances exhibited by the junctionless transistor, this device has to be tested against variability before it may be produced in large scale. Hence, the study of how the fluctuations in the number and in the position of the dopant atoms affects a large number of devices has been developed in this work. Such variability source is referred to as Random Dopant Fluctuations (RDF) and it is among the most critical ones for conventional MOSFETs.

Nanowires in the InAs/InP material system were grown by chemical beam epitaxy from size-selected nanoparticle catalysts. The heterostructure interfaces between the InAs and InP regions were determined to be almost atomically abrupt from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy investigations. Ohmic contacts, showing linear I-V characteristics down to 4. 2 K, were developed to homogeneous InAs nanowires, and transport in these wires was investigated. From electrical characterization of InAs nanowires containing a thick InP barrier, the InP barrier height was estimated to be ~ 0. 6 eV relative to the InAs conduction band edge. Resonant tunneling diodes were fabricated by incorporating a 15 nm InAs dot between two thin InP tunnel barriers. These devices showed peak-to-valley ratios up to 50 : 1 at 4. 2 K.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Electric and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. There is {{increasing}} use of commercial components in space technology {{and it is important}} to recognize that the space radiation environment poses the risk of permanent malfunction due to radiation. Therefore, the integrated circuits used for spacecraft electronics must be resistant to radiation. The effect of using the MOSFET device in a radiation environment is that the gate oxide becomes ionized by the dose it absorbs due to the radiation induced trapped charges in the gate-oxide. The trapped charges in the gate-oxide generate additional space charge fields at the oxide-substrate interface. After a sufficient dose, a large positive charge builds up, having the same effect as if a positive voltage was applied to the gate terminal. Therefore, the transistor source to drain current can no longer be controlled by the gate terminal and the device remains on permanently resulting in device failure. There are four processes involved in the radiation response of MOS devices. First, the ionizing radiation acts with the gate oxide layer to produce electron-hole pairs. Some fraction of the electron-hole pairs recombine depending on the type of incident particle and the applied gate to substrate voltage, i. e. the electric field. The mobility of the electron is orders of magnitude larger than that of the holes in the gate oxide, and is swept away very quickly in the direction of the gate terminal. The time for the electrons to be swept away is on the order of 1 ps. The holes that escape recombination remain near their point of origin. The number of these surviving holes determines the initial response of the device after a short pulse of radiation. The cause of the first process, i. e. the presence of the electric field, is the main motivation for design method described in this dissertation. The second process is the slow transport of holes toward the oxide-silicon interface due to the presence of the electric field. When the holes reach the interface, process 3, they become captured in long term trapping sites and this is the main cause of the permanent threshold voltage shift in MOS devices. The fourth process is the buildup of interface states in the substrate near the interface The main contribution of this dissertation is the development of the novel Switched Modular Redundancy (SMR) method for mitigating the effects of space radiation on satellite electronics. The overall idea of the SMR method is as follows: A charged particle is accelerated in the presence of an electric field. However, in a solid, electrons will move around randomly in the absence of an applied electric field. Therefore if one averages the movement over time there will be no overall motion of charge carriers in any particular direction. On applying an electric field charge carriers will on average move in a direction aligned with the electric field, with positive charge carriers such as holes moving in the direction of field, and negative charge carriers moving in the opposite direction. As is the case with process one and two above. It is proposed in this dissertation that if we apply the flatband voltage (normaly a zero bias for the <b>ideal</b> NMOS <b>transistor)</b> to the gate terminal of a MOS transistor in the presence of ionizing radiation, i. e. no electric field across the gate oxide, both the free electrons and holes will on average remain near their point of origin, and therefore have a greater probability of recombination. Thus, the threshold voltage shift in MOS devices will be less severe for the gate terminal in an unbiased condition. The flatband conditions for the real MOS transistor is discussed in appendix E. It was further proposed that by adding redundancy and applying a resting policy, one can significantly prolong the useful life of MOS components in space. The fact that the rate of the threshold voltage shift in MOS devices is dependant on the bias voltage applied to the gate terminal is a very important phenomenon that can be exploited, since we have direct control and access to the voltage applied to the gate terminal. If for example, two identical gates were under the influence of radiation and the gate voltage is alternated between the two, then the two gates should be able to withstand more total dose radiation than using only one gate. This redundancy could be used in a circuit to mitigate for total ionizing dose. The SMR methodology would be to duplicate each gate in a circuit, then selectively only activating one gate at a time allowing the other to anneal during its off cycle. The SMR algorithm was code in the “C” language. In the proposed design methodology, the design engineer need not be concerned about radiation effects when describing the hardware implementation in a hardware description language. Instead, the design engineer makes use of conventional design techniques. When the design is complete, it is synthesized to obtain the gate level netlist in edif format. The edif netlist is converted to structural VHDL code during synthesis. The structural VHDL netlist is fed into the SMR “C” algorithm to obtain the identical redundant circuit components. The resultant file is also a structural VHDL netlist. The generated VHDL netlist or SMR circuit can then be mapped to a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Spacecraft electronic designers increasingly demand high performance microprocessors and FPGAs, because of their high performance and flexibility. Because FPGAs are reprogrammable, they offer the additional benefits of allowing on-orbit design changes. Data can be sent after launch to correct errors or to improve system performance. System including FPGAs covers a wide range of space applications, and consequently, they are the object of this study in order to implement and test the SMR algorithm. We apply the principles of reconfigurable computing to implement the Switched Modular Redundancy Algorithm in order to mitigate for Total Ionizing Dose (TID) effects in FPGA’s. It is shown by means of experimentation that this new design technique provides greatly improved TID tolerance for FPGAs. This study was necessary in order to make the cost of satellite manufacturing as low as possible by making use of Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. However, these COTS components are very susceptible to the hazards of the space environment. One could also make use of Radiation Hard components for the purpose of satellite manufacturing, however, this will defeat the purpose of making the satellite manufacturing cost as low as possible as the cost of the radiation hard electronic components are significantly higher than their commercial counterparts. Added to this is the undesirable fact that the radiation hard components are a few generations behind as far as speed and performance is concerned, thus providing even greater motivation for making use of Commercial components. Radiation hardened components are obtained by making use of special processing methods in order to improve the components radiation tolerance. Modifying the process steps is one of the three ways to improve the radiation tolerance of an integrated circuit. The two other possibilities are to use special layout techniques or special circuit and system architectures. Another method, in which to make Complementary Metal Oxide Silicon (CMOS) circuits tolerant to ionizing radiation is to distribute the workload among redundant modules (called Switched Modular Redundancy above) in the circuit. This new method will be described in detail in this thesis...|$|R
