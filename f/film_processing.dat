25|$|Scheduled for a twelve-month shoot, the twenty-four episodes took fifteen {{months to}} complete, with the {{production}} experiencing a number of difficulties. Britain's mandatory three-day work week and the unplugging of the National Grid during the coal shortages due to industrial unrest of the early 1970s did not delay filming as Pinewood had its own generators, but it affected <b>film</b> <b>processing</b> as the lab was an off-site contractor.|$|E

25|$|Forms of {{tone mapping}} long precede digital photography. The {{manipulation}} {{of film and}} development process to render high contrast scenes, especially those shot in bright sunlight, on printing paper with a relatively low dynamic range, is effectively a form of tone mapping, {{although it is not}} usually called that. Local adjustment of tonality in <b>film</b> <b>processing</b> is primarily done via dodging and burning, and is particularly advocated by and associated with Ansel Adams, as described in his book The Print; see also his Zone System.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of the television programmes was decentralised, with three Base Production Centres located at Delhi, Cuttack and Hyderabad, and an ISRO studio located in Mumbai. Each of the centres had a production studio, three IVC tape recorders, two 16mm. projectors, a slide Projector in Telecine and audio equipment like tape desks and turntables. Each centre also had 2–3 full-fledged synchronised sound camera units, an editing table (Delhi had two) and a <b>film</b> <b>processing</b> plant.

Ball and Arnaz offered to take a pay cut to finance filming, on the condition that their company, Desilu, would retain the rights to that film once it was aired. CBS relinquished the show rights to Desilu after initial broadcast, not realizing they were giving away a valuable and durable asset. In 1957, CBS bought the rights back for $1,000,000 ($ in today's terms), which provided Ball and Arnaz the down payment for the purchase of the former RKO Pictures studios, which became Desilu Studios.|$|R

He finds her breaking up with her previous boyfriend, Ralph Mandy, to be with Dolarhyde; McClane grants Mandy's request for a final kiss goodbye. Enraged with jealousy, Dolarhyde kills Mandy. He kidnaps Reba and, having taken her to his house, sets the place on fire. He says he intends to kill her and then himself, but finds himself unable to shoot her. The shotgun fires, and a body hits the floor. Reba escapes just before the house explodes. Graham later comforts her, telling her {{that there is nothing}} wrong with her, and that the kindness and affection she showed Dolarhyde probably saved lives.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} had its land-based home at Teller, Alaska.

The production took [...] (0.32 metric tonnes) of food with them to Alaska, as well as medical supplies, a mobile <b>film</b> <b>processing</b> laboratory, and sound recording equipment. Many native people ate bacon, corn flakes, and oranges for the first time, and became enamored of the food. Film was flown out of Teller back to Los Angeles every seven or eight weeks.|$|E
500|$|Frank's Cock won several awards at {{domestic}} and international film festivals. At the 1994 TIFF it won the NFB–John Spotton Award, given for the best Canadian short film.

It was later revealed that a top official of the lab had sold the master copy for 200,000 rupees to film pirates to make pirated copies of the film to sell in India and overseas. Several people were arrested, including the manager of Adlabs Processing, for allegedly stealing the master copy and producing pirated copies. The print was later recovered by the police, who also found and seized pirated CDs and DVDs produced from the master copy.|$|R

Two rival newsreel companies, who were each vying {{to be the first}} to have their films of the ceremony shown in New York theaters, chartered a train and an aircraft, respectively, from Washington to New York City. No. 460 headed up the charter train, pulling only its tender, a baggage car and a passenger car. The train departed Washington at 1:14 PM and arrived at the Manhattan Transfer, outside of New York City, 2 hours and 56 minutes later. The final leg, through the tunnels underneath the Hudson River, was completed by an electric DD1.

2500|$|Kodachrome, {{the first}} modern [...] "integral tripack" [...] (or [...] "monopack") color film, was {{introduced}} by Kodak in 1935. It captured the three color components in a multi-layer emulsion. One layer was sensitized to record the red-dominated part of the spectrum, another layer recorded only the green part and a third recorded only the blue. Without special <b>film</b> <b>processing,</b> the result would simply be three superimposed black-and-white images, but complementary cyan, magenta, and yellow dye images were created in those layers by adding color couplers during a complex processing procedure.|$|E

5000|$|Reversal film is {{sometimes}} used as motion picture film, {{mostly in the}} 16 mm, Super 8 and 8 mm [...] "cine" [...] formats, to yield a positive image on the camera original. This avoids the expense of using negative film, which requires additional <b>film</b> and <b>processing</b> to create a positive film print for projection.|$|R
2500|$|The major film studios {{owned the}} theaters where their motion {{pictures}} were shown, either in partnerships or outright and complete. Thus specific theater chains showed only the films {{produced by the}} studio that owned them. The studios created the films, had the writers, directors, producers and actors on staff ("under contract" [...] as it was called), owned the <b>film</b> <b>processing</b> and laboratories, created the prints and distributed them through the theaters that they owned: In other words, the studios were vertically integrated, creating a de facto oligopoly. By 1945, the studios owned either partially or outright 17% of the theaters in the country, accounting for 45% of the film-rental revenue.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} years of the Montreal Metro's life, a unique mode of {{advertising}} was used. In some downtown tunnels, cartoons depicting an advertiser's product were mounted on the walls of the tunnel at the level of the cars' windows. A retail <b>film</b> <b>processing</b> outfit called Direct Film advertised on the north wall in the Westbound track of the Guy (now Guy-Concordia)-to-Atwater Station (Green Line) during 1967-1969. Strobe lights, aimed at the frames of the cartoon and triggered by the passing train, sequentially illuminated the images so that they appeared to the viewer (passenger) on the train as a movie. Today known as [...] "tunnel movies" [...] or [...] "tunnel advertising", they have been installed in many cities' subways around the world in recent years, for example in the Southgate tube station in London and the MBTA Red Line in Boston.|$|E

50|$|In the mid-1970s, Betamax and VHS home {{videocassette}} recorders were introduced. Color video cameras, previously {{beyond the}} financial reach {{of all but}} the richest amateurs, gradually became cheaper and smaller. Battery-powered camcorders combined the recorder and the camera into one portable and increasingly compact and affordable unit. By the early 1980s an hour of blank videotape cost {{no more than a}} three-minute 50-foot roll of 8 mm <b>film</b> with <b>processing.</b> The writing was on the wall for cine film as a mass market item, though even in the early 2010s all the film formats mentioned above are still supported with new <b>film</b> stock and <b>processing,</b> albeit only from a very few specialist suppliers.|$|R
