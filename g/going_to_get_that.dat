Elizabeth was as sweet as only she could be and protested that it didn't matter, that she didn't mind if she didn't have it, that {{there was much more}} in life than baubles, that she would manage with what she had. The {{inference}} was that she would make do. But not me!... I screamed at Aaron that bugger Cartiers, I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> diamond if it cost me my life or 2 million dollars whichever was the greater. For 24 hours the agony persisted and in the end I won. I got the bloody thing".|$|E

To get to first grade you've {{got to be}} a friggin' good player and once you get there the {{competition}} is very, very fierce. Unfortunately it's not the same standard [...] Competition is everything and the only way the New Zealand guys are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> is to play the world's best players." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to his {{signing with}} WWE, Sting's legacy was perpetuated by the organization. It hailed him as [...] "one of sports-entertainment's elite", and ranked him at {{number one in}} listings of the {{greatest}} wrestlers to never perform in WWE, and the greatest stars in WCW history. In 2013, the company named Sting's WCW World Heavyweight Championship contest against Diamond Dallas Page, on April 26, 1999, as the greatest match ever aired on WCW's flagship Monday Nitro program. At Night of Champions 2013, WWE organized a viewer poll to determine the greatest United States Champion of all time: Sting, a two-time champion, beat out the other four contenders – all WWE Hall of Famers – in a landslide victory with 53% of the overall vote. In regard to Sting's creative handling after he signed with WWE, PWInsider editor Dave Scherer wrote that [...] "he really represented WCW so he was never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> [...] treatment".|$|E

2500|$|No {{conceptual}} {{music videos}} {{ended up being}} made to promote Invitation to the Dance, {{in part due to}} issues with the band's troubled label London-Sire. Despite being one of the heavier songs on the album, [...] "Falling Down" [...] received moderate airplay, leading to it initially being considered. Max Illidge stated in 2002 [...] "We could have made a video for it and maybe if the video was shocking enough it would have given us a bigger push, but London-Sire just decided to scrap [...] "Falling Down" [...] and go with [...] "Wither Away" [...] for the video. I mean we were literally going to leave in like a few days to shoot the video for ‘Wither Away" [...] — en route to LA — we had the plane tickets and the actresses schedules and just all that, and we were about three days away from the day of shooting and we got the phone call that we weren’t doing it {{and they were going to}} wait until early next year, but we knew that they were folding. We are not ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> video." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{shook my}} head vigorously, and saying, [...] "No more! no more!" [...] threw myself over the wall, and seized the rope, Rectus holding the grapnel in its place as I did so.

6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} didn't. I'm {{invisible}} to the eyes of human beings unless they get within three feet of me, and I take care to keep more than that distance away from them.

Now, then," [...] he added, crossly, [...] "are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> rope off?" ...|$|E
5000|$|When Raekwon {{was asked}} about the album in an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, he explained [...] "It’s not nothing derogatory towards Wu. It’s just that Shaolin (i.e. Staten Island) is the place, Wu-Tang is the crew that came from that place. It’s like me just <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> my history of being an emcee first, before I actually became part of Wu-Tang. I always give RZA that support as far as saying he brought Wu-Tang to the table. It was his philosophy. He picked certain dudes {{to be part of this}} group, and he said, 'This is what it’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be called'. Before that, I was on the block. I was living in Shaolin. So this album just shows the street side of me, challenging the great side of Wu-Tang. Which is almost like how T.I. did T.I. vs. T.I.P. You’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> sounds <b>that</b> relate <b>to</b> Wu-Tang. You’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> sounds <b>that</b> relate <b>to</b> great Rae at his best shit, too.

5000|$|Some {{hold that}} {{divestment}} campaigns {{are based on}} a fundamental misunderstanding of how stock markets work. John Silber, former president of Boston University, observed that while boycotting a company's products would actually affect their business, [...] "once a stock issue has been made, the corporation doesn't care whether you sell it, burn it, or anything else, because they've already got all the money they're ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> from <b>that</b> stock.

6000|$|Reddie Ray {{had been}} the intercollegiate {{champion}} in the sprints and a famous college ball player. After {{a few months of}} professional ball he was hitting over [...] .400 and leading the league both at bat and on the bases. It was a beautiful and a thrilling sight to see him run. He was so quick to start, so marvelously swift, so keen of judgment, that neither Delaney nor any player could ever tell the hit that he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get.</b> <b>That</b> was why Reddie Ray was a whole game in himself.|$|E
6000|$|He {{came back}} to the Bowery briskly, alone, with the manhood of a loaf of bread in him. He was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> job as porter. He planned his {{campaign}} as a politician plans to become a statesman. He slipped the sign, [...] "Porter wanted in A.M.," [...] from its nail and hid it beneath his coat. He tramped the block all night and, as suspicious characters always do to avoid seeming suspicious, he begged a match from a policeman who was keeping an eye on him. The policeman chatted with him about baseball and advised him to keep away from liquor and missions.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] {{continued}} Colonel Starbottle, {{setting his}} glass upon his knee, and audibly smacking his large lips. [...] "No, sir, I waited in the--er--ante-chamber until I saw you part with your guests--until you bade--er--adieu {{to a certain}} fair nymph--Ged, sir, I like your taste, and I call myself a judge of fine women--'Blank it all,' I said to myself, 'Blank it all, Star, you ain't goin' to pop out upon a man just as he's ministering to Beauty and putting a shawl upon a pair of alabaster shoulders like that!' Ha! ha! Ged, sir, I remembered myself that in '43 in Washington at a party at Tom Benton's I was in just such a position, sir. 'Are you never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> cloak on, Star?' she says to me--the most beautiful creature, the acknowledged belle of that whole winter--'43, sir--as a gentleman yourself you'll understand why I don't particularise--'If I had my way, madam,' I said, 'I never would!' I did, blank me. But you're not drinking, Mr. Dumphy, eh? A thimbleful, sir, to our better acquaintance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Every cent!" [...] said Wally firmly. [...] "And {{the young}} Greek brigand who stole my hat {{at the door}} is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a dollar! <b>That,</b> as our ascetic and honourable friend Goble would say, {{is the sort of}} little guy I am!" ...|$|R

50|$|This song {{is about}} young {{people living in}} the Northeast of America. Their lives are miserable because the steel {{factories}} are closing down.

5000|$|The next day, {{the group}} discovers a large footprint, and stake out a nearby ridge. The Geek appears, and rapes {{one of the}} women when she {{approaches}} it. The beast then goes after Valerie, and rapes her as well. The men attack the Geek, but it fights them off, and escapes. As the wounded campers limp away, one of them vows [...] "Some day I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> filthy animal!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The series used 50 horses, {{trained by}} Matt Chew at Santa Anita. As he described, [...] "Because it’s a natural {{tendency}} for horses {{to want to}} be a part of a herd, most adapt to it very well. We have a couple individuals that have been taught to be race horses; we’re not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> out of their system. We'll just have to adapt to it. But of the 50 horses, I’d say 45 of them have adapted to it real well." ...|$|E
5000|$|Considered {{a leading}} Sovietologist during the 1940s and 1950s, Mandel {{was a fellow}} at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, but lost his {{position}} there due to the political pressures of the McCarthy era.
