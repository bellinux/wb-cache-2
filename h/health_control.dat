We examined the self-esteem, internal <b>health</b> locus of <b>control,</b> and external <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> through sociodemographic and neurocognitive factors. Methods: Forty-six schizophrenic patients and 31 healthy residents from the community or hospital were recruited as the control group. All subjects participated in the self-esteem questionnaire, <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> questionnaire, {{and a series of}} neuropychological measures. Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed that inhibition of attention and external <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> were predictors for self-esteem (r=− 0. 30, P< 0. 05; r= 0. 41, P< 0. 01); inhibition of attention and external <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> were contributors for internal <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> (r=− 0. 43, P< 0. 01; r= 0. 61, P< 0. 001); and education was related to external <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> (r=− 0. 31, P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The current study integrated background characteristics and cognitive function to better understand the impact of self-esteem and <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> in schizophrenia. The findings indicated that inhibition of attention, external <b>health</b> locus of <b>control,</b> and education contributed to self-esteem, internal <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> and external <b>health</b> locus of <b>control.</b> However, the overall predicted variance accounted for by these predictors was small; thus, further research is necessary to examine imperative variables related with self-esteem and <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> in schizophrenia.

This paper re-solves these seemingly contradictory results by analyzing the effects of both unemployment and the unemployment rate on health using individual-level panel data.

Furthermore, the effect of the unemployment rate on health is limited only to individuals who remain employed during business fluctuations.

The subjects of our study are 192 students in 6 groups of the 9. Grade students of a high school. Three groups of 108 students were randomly selected as the experiment group who were subjected to 4 class-hours specific lectures on <b>health</b> locus of <b>control.</b> The rest 84 students constituted the control group. A 34 -item questionnaire for health behaviours and the Multidimensional <b>Health</b> Locus of <b>Control</b> Scale (MHLOC), were filled by the students before and after the lectures. The lectures on <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> increased the perception of internal <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> of adolescents while decreasing chance <b>health</b> locus of <b>control.</b> The differences between experiment and control groups in this aspect were found to be statistically significant.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} the <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> and self-management behaviors in patients receiving hemodialysis. Methods: Patients receiving hemodialysis in Xiamen, Fujian province, from December 2014 to March 2015 answered the Chinese version of the Multidimensional <b>Health</b> Locus of <b>Control</b> scale and the self-management behavior questionnaire. Results: The {{participants in this study}} indicated that they believed others exerted more <b>control</b> over their <b>health</b> than themselves or chance. In addition, the majority of participants had a medium to low level of self-management behaviors.

The GC/MS-PLS-LDA analysis allowed comprehensive detection of plasma fatty acid, enabling fatty acid metabolic characterization of DM- 2 patients, which included biomarkers different from <b>health</b> <b>controls</b> and dynamic change of NEFA profiles of patients after treated with medicine.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> and functioning in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) was investigated. The hypothesis {{was that an}} internal <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> {{would be associated with}} less impairment in functioning than other dimensions of <b>health</b> locus of <b>control.</b> Prior research undertaken into CFS has been inconsistent in its finding's and it continues to be an area of controversial interpretations. A repeated measures design was used, 74 people participated at the initial stage of the study and 67 people participated in the second stage. The Functional Limitations Profile was used to assess levels of impairment. The Multidimensional <b>Health</b> Locus of <b>Control</b> was used to identify types of <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> orientation, and the Shapiro Control Inventory was used to establish a clearer picture of control issues. Correlations and t-tests were used to investigate the {{relationship between}} <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> and functioning. The results of these analyses indicated that an internal <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> was positively related to functioning. Multiple regression analysis was performed and showed that an internal <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> could successfully predict functioning measured at the second stage of the study. An unexpected discovery was that a doctor's <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> impacted negatively on functioning. The Shapiro Control Inventory revealed that the CFS sample fell within the normal range in the majority of control areas, but was outside the normal range in only six of the 23 control areas. These findings indicated that <b>health</b> locus of <b>control</b> does {{play an important role in}} CFS. It was therefore concluded that increasing a patient's sense of control and reflecting this in the treatment regime of CFS would aid recovery...|$|R
