5|$|On 24 July 2015, Jeremy Peace {{announced}} that his sale <b>exclusivity</b> deal was now off after potential buyer {{was unable to}} fulfil terms of sale.|$|E
5|$|Five {{downloadable}} content (DLC) packs {{have been}} released: the T-Bone Content Bundle, Human Conditions, No Compromise, Root Access Bundle, and Psychedelic Pack. As per an <b>exclusivity</b> agreement with Sony Interactive Entertainment, all DLC for Watch Dogs 2 were timed exclusives for PlayStation 4.|$|E
5|$|A {{spin-off}} series, , {{was produced}} exclusively for mobile phones and was broadcast first to Sprint customers in April 2006 on SprintTV's Fox station. The first episode of Proof of Innocence became {{available on the}} Internet for viewing on May 8, 2006. This was an exclusive deal made between Toyota Motor and News Corporation's Fox network, allowing Toyota to sponsor exclusive content of the show and to obtain advertising <b>exclusivity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{presented}} Xem as his Aeonic Word to the Setians, presenting it as {{a natural}} and necessary further development of Aquino's Xeper. Aquino later acknowledged Xem as a worthwhile magical concept for Setians to explore, but found Barrett's insistence on its <b>exclusivity</b> as incompatible with the Temple's individualistic philosophy.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Soule {{signed an}} MMO <b>exclusivity</b> deal with Sony Online Entertainment, {{in order to}} compose music for Everquest Next and Landmark. The move saw an end to his six-year {{collaboration}} with the Guild Wars series. Everquest Next was later cancelled in March 2016; Landmark was released in 2016, but was shut down {{less than a year}} later in February 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{suburb of}} Beaumont, in the City of Burnside, was founded as a {{purpose-built}} village by Sir Samuel Davenport in 1848. The location of Beaumont to Adelaide, a rapidly developing settlement at the time, made {{land in the}} area extremely expensive. Although Adelaide as a new settlement was prospering during the mid-19th century, still very few people could afford the <b>exclusivity</b> of Beaumont.|$|E
5|$|TowerFall was Thorson's first {{commercial}} game. It followed from a June 2012 game jam single-player prototype. Thorson tested {{the game on}} his indie developer colleagues with whom he lived, and developed its capacity as a party game. Its mechanics were inspired by games of Thorson's youth, such as Bushido Blade and GoldenEye 007, and influenced by demo feedback at the Evolution Championship Series fighting game tournament. TowerFall {{was known as the}} standout title for the Ouya at the console's launch, and sold well. When the Ouya <b>exclusivity</b> expired, Thorson signed another <b>exclusivity</b> agreement for the PlayStation 4, where Ascension received an expanded single-player mode, and new levels, weapons, and gameplay variants. A PlayStation Vita release followed in 2015 and an Xbox One version is in development. A standalone eight-player edition for Windows released in 2016.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{the album}} became {{exclusively}} available to iTunes Stores, Sony Music Entertainment handed down an edict that forbade retailers to put the album up for pre-order, as to further protect the <b>exclusivity</b> with iTunes. It was then reported that US retailers Target and Amazon refused to sell the physical copy of the album. According to a Target spokesperson, the store was only interested in retailing albums which were released digitally and physically simultaneously. On December 21, 2013, all the videos from the album were screened at the SVA Theater in New York.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{theories}} of constraints {{focus on how}} children learn nouns, but ignore other aspects of their word learning. Although constraints are useful in explaining how children limit possible meanings when learning novel words, the same constraints would eventually need to be overridden {{because they are not}} utilized in adult language. For instance, adult speakers often use several terms, each term meaning something slightly different, when referring to one entity, such as a family pet. This practice would violate the mutual <b>exclusivity</b> constraint.|$|E
5|$|Daft Punk were {{scheduled}} {{to appear on the}} episode of The Colbert Report on 6 August 2013 to promote Random Access Memories, but were unable to do so because of contractual obligations regarding the duo's later appearance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. According to Stephen Colbert, Daft Punk were unaware of any <b>exclusivity</b> agreement and were halted by MTV executives the morning prior to the taping. In 2015, Daft Punk appeared alongside several other musicians to announce their co-ownership of the music service Tidal at its relaunch.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, administrators Ernst & Young {{entered into}} an <b>exclusivity</b> {{agreement}} with Malaysia's SP Setia and Sime Darby {{to develop the}} site. The Â£400 million sale was completed in September 2012, and the redevelopment intends to implement the Rafael Vinoly design, which had gained planning consent from Wandsworth Council in 2011. In January 2013, the first residential apartments went on sale. Construction on Phase 1 was due to commence in 2013, with completion due in 2016/17. Apple will locate its new London headquarters at Battersea Power Station, becoming the largest office tenant with 1,400 staff across six floors in the central boiler house.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, it was {{reported}} that WhiteWater World planned to add a WhiteWater West AquaLoop. However Village Roadshow Theme Parks, owner of competitor Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast, attempted to negotiate an <b>exclusivity</b> agreement with the manufacturer. Three months later in February 2010, it was announced that WhiteWater World would build an alternative attraction built by ProSlide before the April school holidays. The Wedgie, the first ProSlide Superloop, opened on 1 April 2011. It was the first ride in Australia to feature a trap door release and was marketed as Australia's first looping water slide.|$|E
5|$|Knowing that a {{court battle}} lay ahead, Hadl {{contacted}} Rissman, the errant Tiger licensee, {{to compromise on}} the handheld King Kong game. Hadl wanted to remove the <b>exclusivity</b> provision of the license and to distinguish the handheld game from Donkey Kong so as to weaken any potential counterclaims that one of Universal's licensees had violated Nintendo's intellectual property rights. Rissman complied, giving the hero a fireman hat, replacing barrel graphics with bombs, and making the game platforms straight instead of crooked. This design was approved in early June.|$|E
5|$|Succeeding the SG-1000, the Master System was {{released}} {{as a direct}} competitor to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in the third generation of video game consoles. The NES used virtually the same hardware as the 1983 Famicom while the Master System was constructed with more up-to-date hardware. Despite improved hardware, it failed to overturn Nintendo's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America. However, it attained significantly more success in Europe and Brazil. Compared with its competition from Nintendo, the Master System's game library lacked a number of well-received titles, due to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform <b>exclusivity</b> to the NES.|$|E
5|$|The Capcom Five {{were first}} {{announced}} as games exclusive to the Nintendo GameCube; however, Capcom later ported {{most of the}} titles to other consoles. At the end of 2002, the company confirmed that P.N.03 would be released in 2003 as a GameCube exclusive. In January 2003, the company slated the game for a March release in Japan but retracted the <b>exclusivity</b> announcement. At a press conference prior to the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo, however, Capcom reaffirmed that P.N.03 would be available only for the GameCube. In the end, P.N.03 was the only Capcom Five title to remain exclusive to the system.|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} in his life Beebe was {{developing}} a close friendship with the American romance novelist Elswyth Thane, who had met Beebe in 1925. Very little of their early correspondence survives, but Elswyth had idolized Beebe for years, and her first novel Riders of the Wind was devoted to him. The novel was an account of a young woman who falls in love with, and eventually marries, a much older adventurer who strongly resembled Beebe. Beebe and Elswyth were married on September 22, 1927, when Beebe was 50. Due to Elswyth's tendency to misrepresent her age, conflicting accounts exist of how old she was when she and Beebe were married, ranging from 23 to 28. Elswyth and Beebe had an open marriage, in which neither expected sexual <b>exclusivity</b> from the other so long as their life together was not damaged.|$|E
5|$|During Microsoft's E3 2014 presentation, Rise of the Tomb Raider was {{announced}} as a sequel. At Gamescom 2014, Microsoft announced during its press briefing that Rise of the Tomb Raider would be exclusive to Xbox consoles at launch. The <b>exclusivity</b> is timed, with Square Enix, the game's developer, allowed {{to release the}} title to other platforms after an unspecified period of time. In December 2014, Microsoft announced {{that they would be}} publishing the title for its release on Xbox consoles. Rise of the Tomb Raider was released on 10 November 2015 for Xbox One and Xbox 360, and 28 January 2016 for Microsoft Windows. The PlayStation 4 version was released on 11 October 2016, titled the 20 Year Celebration, as it was released 20 years after the original Tomb Raider game. This version includes all of the previously released DLC.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 {{the company}} {{repaired}} {{its relationship with}} its franchisees by immediately dropping the most contentious of the contract terms that had been proposed by chairman John Cranor five years previously. The 1976 contract was restored, including the 1.5 mile outlet <b>exclusivity</b> zone, while the parent company gained greater control over national advertising. Novak also axed the Colonel's Rotisserie Gold product and introduced a new non-fried item called the Tender Roast. Tender Roast was served by piece, as with the fried chicken, {{in contrast with the}} rotisserie product, which had been sold in quarter, half or whole chicken portions. Afterwards, Novak oversaw ten fiscal quarters of consecutive growth at KFC North America. As a result of his success at KFC North America, Novak became President and CEO of the entire KFC organization in 1996.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, 94% {{of urban}} Sarawak was {{supplied}} with electricity, but only 67% of rural areas had electricity. However, this had increased to 91% by 2014. According to a 2015 article, household internet penetration in Sarawak {{was lower than}} Malaysian national average, 41.2% versus 58.6%, with 58.5% of internet use being in urban areas and 29.9% in rural areas. In comparison, mobile telecommunication uptake in Sarawak was comparable to the national average, 93.3% against a national average of 94.2%, and on par with neighbouring Sabah. Mobile telecommunication infrastructure, specifically broadcast towers, are built and managed by SacofaSdnBhd (Sacofa Private Limited), which enjoys a monopoly in Sarawak after the company was granted a 20-year <b>exclusivity</b> deal on the provision, maintenance and leasing of towers in the state.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, the {{receivers}} granted a two-year <b>exclusivity</b> period to their preferred bidder, the British Virgin Islands-registered investment vehicle Trillion Trophy Asia (TTA), wholly owned by Chinese businessman Paul Suen Cho Hung. After striking {{deals with the}} previous major shareholders such that legal action against them would be dropped {{in return for their}} agreement not to obstruct any transfer of ownership, {{the receivers}} released a document in June 2016 setting out a timescale for the company restructure, share relisting and takeover, to be completed by the end of October. It confirmed that Suen would hold 60.78% of BIH shares and the Yeung faction no more than 14%, and that the company would not be sold on within two years. The process completed on 17 October, leaving TTA owning 50.64% of BIH's share capital, a level of ownership that required them to make an offer for the remainder.|$|E
5|$|In {{a feature}} {{on the five}} best Fire Emblem titles up until 2013, Chris Carter of Destructoid {{included}} Genealogy of the Holy War among them due to the many lasting features it introduced to the series. In a retrospective feature about games not released in the United Kingdom, Digital Spy's Damian McFerren {{referred to it as}} the best game in the series, decrying its <b>exclusivity</b> to Japan. In a different feature for RPGamer, writer Cassandra Ramos called the game the entry she most wished to see released overseas due to its scale and quality when compared to other entries from the period. Both noted that Genealogy of the Holy War was a suitable subject for a remake {{in the wake of the}} international success of more recent titles in the series.|$|E
5|$|Late in the year, AT/Western Electric {{created a}} {{licensing}} division, Electrical Research Products Inc. (ERPI), to handle {{rights to the}} company's film-related audio technology. Vitaphone still had legal <b>exclusivity,</b> but having lapsed in its royalty payments, effective control of the rights was in ERPI's hands. On December 31, 1926, Warners granted Fox-Case a sublicense {{for the use of}} the Western Electric system; in exchange for the sublicense, both Warners and ERPI received a share of Fox's related revenues. The patents of all three concerns were cross-licensed. Superior recording and amplification technology was now available to two Hollywood studios, pursuing two very different methods of sound reproduction. The new year would finally see the emergence of sound cinema as a significant commercial medium.|$|E
5|$|On September 21, 2000, Universal Interactive Studios and Konami {{announced}} that they had entered an agreement that would enable Konami to publish a Crash Bandicoot game for next-generation game systems, with Universal Interactive handling {{the production of the}} games. The agreement served to break the Crash Bandicoot franchise's <b>exclusivity</b> to Sony-produced consoles and effectively made Crash Bandicoot a mascot character for Universal rather than Sony. After Universal fell out with Cerny and Sony, Traveller's Tales was forced to alter the game from a free-roaming title to a standard Crash title. Traveller's Tales had to begin development of the game from scratch and were given only twelve months to complete the game.|$|E
5|$|On {{the central}} precinct sits The Hawthorns, a student house {{accommodating}} 115 undergraduate students. The house started {{life as a}} collection of villas built somewhere between 1888 and 1924 that were later converted, bit by bit, into a hotel by John Dingle. The Hawthorns also houses conferencing facilities, the staff refectory and bar, the Accommodation Office and the Student Houses Office. Several of the residences in the central precinct are more recent and have been built and are managed by third-party organisations under <b>exclusivity</b> arrangements with the University. These include New Bridewell House, opened in 2016, which includes en-suite bedrooms and studios and is in the former police HQ and operated by Fresh Student Housing, Unite House and Chantry Court, opened in 2000 and 2003 respectively by the UNITE Group, as well as Dean's Court (2001, postgraduates only) and Woodland Court (2005), both run by the Dominion Housing Group.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil was {{developed}} {{over the course of}} one year and two months as part of an <b>exclusivity</b> deal between Capcom and Nintendo. It was directed by Shinji Mikami, who also designed and directed the original Resident Evil. Mikami decided to produce a remake because he felt that the original had not aged well enough and that the GameCube's capabilities could bring it closer to his original vision. The game retains the same graphical presentation, with 3D models superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds. However, the quality of the graphics was vastly improved. The remake also features new gameplay mechanics, revised puzzles, additional explorable areas, a revised script, and new story details including an entire subplot cut from the original game.|$|E
5|$|The {{concession}} conferred on the grantees {{the sole}} rights to mine throughout Lobengula's country, {{as well as}} the power to defend this <b>exclusivity</b> by force, in return for weapons and a regular monetary stipend. Starting in early 1889, the king repeatedly tried to disavow the document on the grounds of alleged deceit by the concessionaires regarding the settled terms; he insisted that restrictions on the grantees' activities had been agreed orally, and apparently considered these part of the contract even though the written text had been translated and repeatedly explained to him just before he signed it. He attempted to persuade the British government to deem the concession invalid, among other things sending emissaries to meet Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, but these efforts proved unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{the first}} Capcom-designed Vs. {{installment}} to be rendered fully in 3D. Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and its graphical characteristics were optimized for the Wii, which prevents the game from being ported to other consoles without completely re-building the game. Niitsuma explained that its Wii <b>exclusivity</b> was also {{due to a lack}} of Capcom fighting games for the console, and because the Wii's casual quality matches the Vs. series trait of accessibility. The producer suggested that porting a sequel would be easier, but that Capcom would gauge the reception of the Wii game before making such plans. On November 7, 2012, Capcom USA's senior vice president Christian Svensson revealed that Capcom's rights with Tatsunoko have lapsed, meaning Capcom is no longer authorized to sell Tatsunoko vs. Capcom physically or digitally.|$|E
5|$|The soundtracks have {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from both dedicated video game music outlets and video game critics. The first game was {{noted for its}} disturbing style, which both drew criticism for repetitiveness and praise for suiting the game's atmosphere. It has been generally cited as an experimental soundtrack. The second game's soundtrack received a more positive reception, with the general opinion being {{that it was a}} more traditional and consequently more comfortable soundtrack. The third game's soundtrack also received fairly positive comments, mainly praising its quality, although critiques were made concerning its variety. The chiptune compilation was generally liked, except for its <b>exclusivity</b> to the special release. The singles have also received praise.|$|E
5|$|To {{maximize}} {{their chances of}} success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. Eidos Interactive, whose release of Tomb Raider had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port. The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' <b>exclusivity</b> deal for North America and Europe at the time. To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a triangular shape for the cover and box. They agreed on a contract price of $1.8 million, making initial sales forecasts of 100,000 units based on that outlay. The PC version was released in North America and Europe on June 25, 1998; the port was not released in Japan. Within one month, sales of the port exceeded the initial forecasts. The PC version would end up providing the source code for subsequent ports.|$|E
5|$|To placate {{physical}} retailers {{affected by}} the digital <b>exclusivity</b> period, Universal offered them a deluxe version of Songs of Innocence that contains four additional songs, along with several acoustic versions of the record's songs. The bonus tracks were exclusive to brick-and-mortar stores and music streaming services for five weeks; the iTunes Store then released the ten deluxe edition tracks under the title Songs of Innocence + on 18 November 2014. Retailers also received catalog deals that discounted U2's albums in stores by US$3 {{for a period of}} time. A Grammy Awards spokesperson initially said the album would not be eligible for consideration at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards because {{it would not have been}} available for purchase prior to the 30 September eligibility deadline. However, this ruling was reversed after UMG released a limited-edition vinyl pressing of the album to retailers on the cutoff date.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, Soma Bringer was not {{released}} outside Japan: no explanation {{was given by}} Nintendo, although there was some speculation that its high text content was to blame. Its <b>exclusivity</b> to Japan has drawn both disappointment and criticism from some journalists, in addition to continued hope for a Western release: an article from IGN cited the release of Glory of Heracles as a possible precursor to a Western release, while gaming site Siliconera reported that Nintendo might release it in the West during the transitional phase between the DS and its successor the Nintendo 3DS, although the writer noted that Soma Bringers text-heavy approach {{made it more difficult}} and thus less appealing to localize. To date, it remains exclusive to Japan. An unofficial open fan translation patch was created: while not complete, it translated the greater majority of text into English.|$|E
5|$|When James Cameron {{agreed to}} make Spider-Man, Carolco lawyers simply used his {{previous}} Terminator 2 contract as a template. A clause in this agreement gave Cameron {{the right to decide}} on movie and advertising credits. Show business trade articles and advertisements made no mention of Golan, who was still actively assembling the elements for the film. In 1993, Golan complained publicly and finally instigated legal action against Carolco for disavowing his contractual guarantee credit as producer. On the other hand, Cameron had the contractual right to decide on credits. Eventually, Carolco sued Viacom and Columbia to recover broadcast and home video rights, and the two studios countersued. 20th Century Fox, though not part of the litigation, contested Cameronâs participation, claiming <b>exclusivity</b> on his services as a director under yet another contract. In 1996, Carolco, 21st Century, and Marvel went bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|A GameCube {{version of}} the game was {{released}} in 2003 {{as part of an}} <b>exclusivity</b> agreement between Capcom and Nintendo. The GameCube version received mixed reviews from critics and was mainly criticized for its relatively high retail price and outdated graphics. AllGame noted that the fact that the game was not priced as a budget title could mislead buyers into thinking that it was an enhanced update similar to the 2002 Resident Evil on the GameCube. GamePro remarked that, while the game's graphics on the GameCube were not like those of the 2002 Resident Evil or Resident Evil Zero, they were better-looking than previous versions of the game. As of November 2003, 41,395 copies of the GameCube version had been sold in the US. Resident Evil 3 was digitally released on the PlayStation Network in Japan in 2008 and North America in 2009, allowing PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable users to play any {{version of the}} game via emulation.|$|E
5|$|According to {{industry}} sources, Capcom's reversal on GameCube <b>exclusivity,</b> particularly with Resident Evil 4, was a betrayal that soured relations between Capcom and Nintendo for several years. After this early pulling of Capcom support, the GameCube {{went on to}} sell 22 million units, less than the Nintendo 64's 33 million units and {{only a fraction of}} the PlayStation 2's 155 million units. Though Resident Evil 4 was eventually ported to Nintendo's Wii in 2007, it also received a high-definition re-release for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2011. The 2002 GameCube remake of Resident Evil and Resident Evil Zero also received remasters for newer consoles in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Super Smash Bros. Brawl was released in 2008, featuring third party characters like Solid Snake from Konami and Sonic the Hedgehog from Sega as a selling point. Kotaku reported on a rumor that Nintendo refused to include a character from Capcom as a direct result of Resident Evil 4s multi-platform release. Years later, Capcom's own Mega Man appeared as a playable character in the next game in the series, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.|$|E
5|$|At Gamescom 2010, BioWare {{announced}} that a PlayStation 3 version of the game was in development. Microsoft responded to the announcement that, despite losing the game's <b>exclusivity,</b> the Xbox 360 was still the most appropriate console {{to play the game}} due to the game's compatibility with the original Mass Effect, which was only available on the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 systems at the time. The PlayStation 3 version was released on January 18, 2011 in North America and January 21, 2011 in Europe. Unlike the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows versions of the game, which span two DVDs, the PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2 fits on one Blu-ray Disc. The downloadable PlayStation Network version accounted for more than 10% of the game's overall sales on PlayStation 3. As of April 2011, it was reported that both the original Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 combined have sold more than seven million units worldwide. In 2012, a compilation featuring the three main games of the series, titled Mass Effect Trilogy, was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. In 2016, Mass Effect 2 was added to the list of backward compatible Xbox 360 games on Xbox One.|$|E
