40|$|This study {{deals with}} an {{automated}} data analysis strategy to pinpoint potential unknown compounds in full scan mass spectrometry (MS) experiments. Three examples of an untargeted metabolomics approach to contaminant analysis are given. By comparing a plant-oil based <b>hormone</b> <b>cocktail</b> to 90 plant oil samples ca. 25 compounds {{specific to the}} <b>hormone</b> <b>cocktail</b> could be detected. Five of these compounds were confirmed as steroid hormones. A comparison of a drink water sample from a farm to distillated water showed the presence of contaminants specific to this drink water sample. A grass sample, which was known to give a false positive result in a DR-CALUX bioassay, was unexpectedly shown to contain an abnormal level of chrysene, which was obviously not eliminated during clean-up...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{desorption}} electrospray ionization (DESI) linear {{ion trap}} tandem mass spectrometry (MSn) {{was applied for}} the confirmation and 3 D profiling of anabolic steroid esters in an injection site of bovine muscle. The spatial resolution of the DESI-MSn was demonstrated by scanning hormone esters and marker ink lines drawn at various distances on a microscopic slide at set distances, using an x-scanner with manual y and z adjustment. Tissue slices of bovine muscle injected with a <b>hormone</b> <b>cocktail</b> were analysed. All anabolic steroid esters could be directly detected in the sample and confirmed based on identification points awarded for selected MS/MS transitions according to the performance criteria in Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC. Moreover, the injection site could be mapped by 2 D and 3 D imaging MS, showing a horizontal and vertical distribution through the muscle tissue. This DESI approach offers potential for analysis of injection sites of steroid esters from illegally treated animals; moreover, direct analysis by ambient imaging DESI-MS still allows conventional extraction {{and analysis of the}} whole tissue for further confirmatory or contraanalysis afterwards...|$|E
40|$|The tissue for {{pancreas}} and islet transplantation, the life-saving treatment for {{type 1 diabetes}} patients; comes predominantly from brain-dead donors. Novel strategies are required to improve transplant outcomes. This thesis spans three approaches to attenuate inflammation in pancreas. Porcine neonatal islet cell clusters (pNICCs), an experimental alternative to human islets, exhibited increased gene expression of proinflammatory mediators after isolation. The anti-inflammatory agent, activated protein C was applied to pNICCs in culture, but did not demonstrate an effect. We applied a <b>hormone</b> <b>cocktail</b> treatment on brain-dead pigs, which improved physiological indices and organ function. Expression of pro-inflammatory markers in pancreas showed a limited increase or was downregulated in the HR group. TUNEL method appeared to overestimate apoptosis in pancreas. Pattern-recognition receptor signalling can be disrupted by competitive binding of esRAGE to danger signals. Mice were transduced with esRAGE-encoding vector and underwent brain death. Exogenous esRAGE was detected in transplantable organs. Gene expression of most proinflammatory markers was modestly decreased in pancreas. Overall, the most promising intervention is hormone resuscitation of the brain-dead donor, which is already in clinical use. Further evaluation {{of the effects of}} the above treatments is necessary to fully understand the potential of these approaches in transplantation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{demonstrate}} the applicability of a yeast androgen and estrogen bioassay in the detection of steroid esters in hair samples of animals treated with a <b>hormone</b> ester <b>cocktail.</b> The outcome of the activity screenings was critically compared with the results previously obtained with LC-MS/MS analysis. Hair samples of one pour-on treated animal, 10 ml DMSO containing 25 mg estradiol benzoate (EB), 60 mg testosterone decanoate (TD) and 60 mg testosterone cypionate (TC), were selected and analyzed with the androgen and estrogen yeast bioassay. Results showed that by the introduction of a hydrolysis step, bioassays can be used to screen for the presence of hormone esters in hair samples. Based on the difference in fluorescence responses between the nonhydrolyzed and the hydrolyzed hair samples, it was possible to detect the presence of EB up to at least 56 days after a single pour-on treatment and to detect the presence of TC and TD up to at least 14 days after the treatment. Although the LC-MS/MS analysis could detect TC and TD up to 49 days after treatment, bioassays have the advantage that they can also detect any (un) known steroid ester. Keywords Testosterone ester.

40|$|WHEN TEACHING RENAL PHYSIOLOGY, it {{is often}} {{difficult}} to sway students to the wonders of the kidney. For most students, it is reasonable straightforward to understand the function of all main tubular transporters on a cellular and segment level and to grasp glomerular filtration and renal hemodynamics. A new level of complexity emerges as the interplay between the tubular segment and vasculature is added for renal autoregu-lation and the urinary concentration mechanism. On top of that comes the overall regulation of renal function by classical systemic <b>hormones.</b> After this <b>cocktail,</b> the exiting area of renal auto- and paracrine regulation is hardly mentioned, particularly because the function and physiological relevance of the many auto and paracrine systems are a challenge for even the most hardcore renal physiologist. Looking through the literature, one can easily understand why this jungle of paracrine regulation i...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Pregnancy is {{associated}} with a depression of the immune inflammatory system, and with increased growth and function of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. We monitored glucosuria, blood glucose concentration, and lymphocytic infiltration of pancreatic islets in 30 female, 10 -wk-old, pre-diabetic non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice divided into 3 treatment groups for 13 wk: group 1, saline; group 2, pregnancy hormones (dexamethasone 4 mg/Kg/day, progesterone 1. 7 mg/Kg/day, growth hormone 0. 6 mg/Kg/day, prolactin 1 mg/Kg/day, and estradiol 0. 05 mg/Kg); and group 3, prolactin alone (1 mg/Kg/day). At sacrifice, the pancreases were fixed in paraformaldehyde and islet infiltration was evaluated. In the saline-treated group (# 1) 4 / 10 mice developed diabetes, while in the hormone treated group (# 2) none of the mice developed diabetes. Only 1 / 10 mice in the prolactin-treated group (# 3) developed diabetes during the study. Islets from the <b>hormone</b> <b>cocktail</b> treated group were significantly less infiltrated than islets from the other 2 treatment groups (p < 0. 001). Thus, the pregnancy hormones protected NOD mice from developing diabetes and significantly reduced or eliminated insulitis and islet infiltration. Prolactin alone had a partial protective effect. The results have implications for prevention of type 1 diabetes and for immune suppression in patients receiving islet cell transplantation.

40|$|Mutations in the Berardinelli-Seip {{congenital}} lipodystrophy 2 gene (BSCL 2) are {{the underlying}} defect {{in patients with}} congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 2. BSCL 2 encodes a protein called seipin, whose function is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of Bscl 2 in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation. Bscl 2 mRNA is highly up-regulated during standard hormone-induced adipogenesis in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells in vitro. However, this up-regulation does not occur during mesenchymal stem cell (C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells) commitment to the preadipocyte lineage. Knockdown of Bscl 2 by short hairpin RNA in C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells {{has no effect on}} bone morphogenetic protein- 4 -induced preadipocyte commitment. However, knockdown in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells prevents adipogenesis induced by a standard <b>hormone</b> <b>cocktail,</b> but adipogenesis can be rescued by the addition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonist pioglitazone at an early stage of differentiation. Interestingly, pioglitazone-induced differentiation in the absence of standard hormone is not associated with up-regulated Bscl 2 expression. On the other hand, short hairpin RNA-knockdown of Bscl 2 largely blocks pioglitazone-induced adipose differentiation. These experiments suggest that Bscl 2 may be essential for normal adipogenesis; it works upstream or at the level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, enabling the latter to exert its full activity during adipogenesis. Loss of Bscl 2 function thus interferes with the normal transcriptional cascade of adipogenesis during fat cell differentiation, resulting in near total loss of fat or lipodystrophy...|$|E
40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the mechanism of adipose tissue differentiation is of paramount importance in the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment and prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Optimal results using tissue culture models can be expected only when the in vitro adipocyte resembles adipose tissue in vivo as closely as possible. In this study, we used tissue-engineering principles to develop a three-dimensional (3 -D) culture system to mimic the geometry of adipose tissue in vivo. Mouse preadipocyte 3 T 3 -L 1 cells were seeded onto nonbiodegradable fibrous polyethylene terephthalate scaffolds and differentiated with a <b>hormone</b> <b>cocktail</b> consisting of insulin, dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine, and fetal calf serum. Cell morphology, growth, differentiation, and function were studied by immunocytochemistry, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and oil red O staining. Cells grown on 3 -D fibrous scaffolds were differentiated in situ by hormone induction with high efficiency (approximately 90 %) as shown by scanning electron microscopy. Immunocytochemistry, immunoblot analysis, and RT-PCR revealed that the 3 - D constructs expressed adipocyte-specific genes, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, leptin, adipsin, aP 2, adiponectin, GLUT 4, and resistin. Adipocytes matured on 3 -D constructs secreted leptin at levels even greater than that of fully differentiated adipocytes in 2 -D conventional cell cultures. Finally, adipocyte-specific phenotypic function was demonstrated by accumulation of neutral lipids in larger fat droplets. In conclusion, preadipocytes grown on 3 -D matrices acquire morphology and biological features of mature adipocytes. This new culture model should have significant utility for in vitro studies of adipocyte cell biology and development...|$|E
40|$|The {{abuse of}} {{synthetic}} esters of natural steroids such as testosterone and estradiol in cattle fattening and sports {{is hard to}} detect via routine urine testing. The esters are rapidly hydrolysed in vivo into substances which are also endogenously present in urine. An interesting alternative can be provided by {{the analysis of the}} administered synthetic steroids themselves, i. e., the analysis of intact steroid esters in hair by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). However, retrospective estimation of the application date following a non-compliant finding is hindered by the complexity of the kinetics of the incorporation of steroid esters in hair. In this study, the incorporation of intact steroid esters in hair following pour-on treatment has been studied and critically compared with results from intramuscular treatment. To this end animals were pour-on treated with a <b>hormone</b> <b>cocktail</b> containing testosterone cypionate, testosterone decanoate and estradiol benzoate in different carriers. The animals were either treated using injection and pour-on application once or three times having 1  week between treatments using injection and pour-on application. Animals were slaughtered from 10 – 12  weeks after the last treatment. Both hair and blood plasma samples were collected and analysed by LC/MS/MS. From the results, it is concluded that after single treatment the levels of steroid esters in hair drop to CCβ levels (5 – 20  µg/kg) after 5 – 7  weeks. When treatment is repeated two times, the CCβ levels are reached after 9 – 11  weeks. Furthermore, in plasma, no steroid esters were detected; not even at the low microgramme per litre level but—in contrast with the pour-on application—after i. m. injection, significant increase of 17 β-testosterone and 17 β-estradiol were observed. These observations suggest that transport of steroid esters after pour-on application is not only performed by blood but also by alternative fluids in the animal so probably the steroid esters are already hydrolysed and epimerized before entering the blood...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{expression}} and function of proteins important for human health in normal development provides valuable information {{for the design of}} therapeutical opportunities in the context of disease. Myc is one of the current most promising targets for a number of cancer types including triple-negative breast cancer and Miz 1 has been shown {{to play an important role}} in Myc-mediated tumorigenesis. In the present work, the function of the Myc-binding protein Miz 1 in the mammary gland is investigated for the first time using two different lines of transgenic mice expressing Cre-recombinase to conditionally knockout the POZ domain of Miz 1 in the murine mammary gland. Deletion of this evolutionary-conserved region impedes multimerization and stable association of Miz 1 with chromatin. MMTV-Cre mediated deletion was used to investigate Miz 1 function in the virgin gland, considering branching morphogenesis and mammary stem/progenitor biology. Ablation under the Wap-Cre promoter provided information about alveologenesis and mammary differentiation. The mammary gland is a very suitable organ for stem cell and developmental studies as rounds of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis occur after each pregnancy. POZ domain deletion using MMTV-Cre (Line A), already active in the embryo, led to a delayed ductal tree formation, less cellularity in knockout ducts and a Myc-independent accumulation of stem/progenitor cells in virgin mammary glands of Miz 1 DPOZ animals. No differences in the expression of luminal and myoepithelial markers were observed between control and Miz 1 DPOZ virgin mice. In addition, the delay in the development of the mammary ductal tree in knockout mice is rescued at around two months of age. Endogenous Miz 1 expression in the mammary gland of control animals was found to be highly boosted during lactation by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Very low Miz 1 levels were detected at the end of pregnancy, which increased after parturition and diminished upon cessation of pup suckling at around 48 hours of forced involution. Miz 1 POZ domain ablation in luminal alveolar mammary cells during pregnancy using the WAP-Cre transgenic line resulted in a lactation defect in mutant dams during the first two pregnancies analysed. Mutant lactating glands display a reduced alveologenesis as a result of a diminished mammary cell proliferation and differentiation. These data were also confirmed in vitro using the HC 11 murine mammary cell line after retroviral infection for stable knockdown of Miz 1. HC 11 cells with low levels of Miz 1 show a reduced proliferation and a decreased expression of ß-casein after inducing differentiation by addition of a lactogenic <b>hormone</b> <b>cocktail</b> containing prolactin. Apoptosis is unaffected after either Miz 1 POZ domain ablation in vivo or stable knockdown of Miz 1 in vitro. Mutant glands display lower levels of activated Stat 5 which lead to a reduced expression of its transcriptional targets, mainly genes which code for milk proteins like a-casein, b-casein or whey acidic protein (WAP). Gene expression of negative regulators of the Jak 2 /Stat 5 pathway like Socs (Socs 1, Socs 2 and Socs 3) or Caveolin- 1 (Cav 1) is not upregulated in Miz 1 DPOZ lactating glands. In contrast, the expression of receptors important for a proper phosphorylation of Stat 5, like the prolactin receptor or ErbB 4, is decreased in lactating mutant glands. ChIP-Seq experiments revealed that genes encoding the prolactin receptor and ErbB 4 are not direct targets of Miz 1. Rather, Miz 1 binds to genes which regulate vesicular transport and thus alters processes like endocytosis and autophagy in mammary gland cells. A model in which the vesicular transport of these receptors in mutant glands could be disrupted is proposed. In conclusion, this work shows for the first time that Miz 1 is important for mammary stem/progenitor cell regulation in the virgin gland and for a proper proliferation and differentiation in the lactating mammary gland...|$|E
