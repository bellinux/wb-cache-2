50|$|The Pitman arm is a {{steering}} {{component in}} an automobile or truck. As a linkage attached to the steering box (see recirculating ball) sector shaft, it converts the angular motion of the sector shaft into the linear motion needed to steer the wheels. The arm {{is supported by the}} sector shaft and supports the <b>drag</b> <b>link</b> or center link with a ball joint. It transmits the motion it receives from the steering box into the <b>drag</b> (or center) <b>link,</b> causing it to move left or right to turn the wheels in the appropriate direction. The idler arm is attached between {{the opposite side of the}} center link from the Pitman arm and the vehicle's frame to hold the center or <b>drag</b> <b>link</b> at the proper height. A worn ball joint can cause play in the steering, and may get worse over time.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{one end of}} the <b>drag</b> <b>link</b> is {{connected}} via the Pitman arm and steering gearbox to the steering wheel (providing the connection between the driver and the steering system); the other end is attached to the steering linkage, by the steering arm.|$|R

5|$|McLamore and Edgerton {{acquired}} {{a license to}} operate an Insta-Burger King franchise and opened their first location on 4 December 1954 at 3090 NW 36th Street in Miami. By 1959, the pair had stores at several locations within the Miami-Dade area, and operations were growing at a fast rate. However, the partners discovered that the insta-broiler units' heating elements were prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created a mechanized gas grill that avoided the problems by cooking the meat patties a different way inside the unit. The new cooking appliance, which they called a flame broiler, moved the patties over the flame vertically on a chain <b>link</b> <b>conveyor</b> over the heating elements, a design that imparted grill lines on the patties similar to those made on a charcoal grill.

However, at the air show held on opening day in 1959 there were two significant incidents. A Royal New Zealand Air Force Sunderland flying boat scraped its keel along the runway during a low pass in turbulent conditions; it returned to its base at Hobsonville and was beached for repair. A Royal Air Force Avro Vulcan bomber aborted its landing when it touched down short of the runway, rupturing its left main landing gear <b>drag</b> <b>link,</b> the wing attachments and engine fuel lines; the aircraft flew to Ohakea air base where it was stranded for several months being repaired.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{feature of}} the Ferguson System was the three-point linkage. This allowed trailed implements to be supported on a hydraulic system. Two <b>drag</b> <b>links</b> attached under the rear axle with a single compression link connected to the upper rear transmission case automatically regulating the hydraulic suspension's height. This allowed lighter implement to be used, with no attached wheels or separate manual controls. By assisting the tractor to maintain traction from a combined drag and rotary force to the axle, which kept the rear driving wheels on the ground, the front steering wheels had improved contact with the ground. Consequently, the [...] "rearing and bucking" [...] of overloaded tractors was reduced, making tractors much safer for the operator.|$|R

40|$|A PhD project titled: “Direct on-line {{measurement}} of wall friction of coal {{as an indicator}} of handleability”, and sponsored by Corus plc., has arisen from a need to obtain real time information about the flow-ability of the coal, so troublesome batches can be detected before problems arise. The on-line wall friction tester essentially comprises a ‘skid’ plate that rest on the top free surface of a bulk solid being transported on a conveyor belt. The ‘skid’ plate is connected to a load cell via a <b>drag</b> <b>link</b> allowing the shear force between the ‘skid’ plate and bulk solid to be sensed as the latter is conveyed.

40|$|Abstract. The 3 D and 2 D type {{maps for}} planar four-bar and simply RSSR {{linkages}} are constructed with illustration of their application. The criteria determining the rotatability of input or output link are developed or reviewed for both linkages. Three-dimensional type maps are then constructed by integrating the tool for numerical analysis and solid modeling software, e. g. MATLAB and PRO/E. The coordinate axes are mainly three ratios of link lengths. The types are classified {{based on whether}} the input or output link can make fully rotation. Each type map is composed of five regions representing different types. They are <b>drag</b> <b>link,</b> crank-rocker, rocker-crank, double-rocker, and unassembled. Any cross sections can be taken readily and arbitrarily from the 3 D models along any plane or surfaces to get 2 D type maps. The constructed type maps are also combined with curves or surfaces representing performances of transmission ratio. With type maps and related surfaces, the design process can be simplified and expedited substantially...|$|R

Bigger payloads required a four-wheeled float, and the Freighliner was showcased at the 1966 Royal Dairy Show. It came as a 50 cwt model and twin tyres were fitted on the rear axle. In order to retain the manoeuvrability of the three-wheeled vehicles, the front springs and steering <b>drag</b> <b>link</b> were placed inside the frames, which allowed a kerb-to-kerb turning circle of 30 ft to be achieved. The wheelbase was 7.75 ft, with the cab located in front of the front wheels, to give easy access to the driving position. Three models were available, with top speeds of 14 mph, 17 mph and 20 mph. The working range was from 30 to 40 mi, and a series resistance controller was fitted as standard, although the model at the Dairy Show had a thyristor control unit.|$|R
