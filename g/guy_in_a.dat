5|$|For the 2009 remake, {{stuntman}} Derek Mears {{was hired}} to portray Jason Voorhees at the recommendation of makeup special effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Mears's pleasant demeanor had the studio worried {{about his ability to}} portray such a menacing character on screen, but Mears assured them {{he would be able to}} perform the role. When Mears auditioned for the role he was asked why they should hire an actor over just another <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mask. As Mears explained, portraying Jason is similar to Greek mask work, where the mask and the actor are two separate entities, and, based on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance.|$|E

Politicians and diplomats found evident contradictions between the claim and the photos and the videotape footage that documented the time before and after the shooting. Years later, the official investigation into the assassination concluded that Galman was a fall <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> larger plot to kill Aquino; despite this conclusion, many prominent individuals continue to support the position that Galman was the perpetrator.|$|E

500|$|Brad Greenquist {{appeared}} as a Rigelian in this episode in his second appearance on Enterprise, he too had also previously appeared in episodes of DS9 and Voyager. The other Rigelians were played by stuntmen Brian Williams and Tom Dupont, whilst Linda Park was stunt-doubled by Diana Inosato. It was the second appearance of Seth MacFarlane, {{the creator of the}} animated television show Family <b>Guy,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> role in Enterprise. He had previously {{appeared as}} an unnamed character in the third-season episode [...] "" [...] but gains the name Ensign Rivers in [...] "Affliction".|$|E
500|$|It wasn’t as hard as, say, {{running around}} with all my gear on in Jarhead. I’d rather go for an awkward moment than {{physical}} exertion any day. The only thing that I think [...] get freaked out about {{when they have to}} do something like kiss a <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> movie—when to their knowledge they’re straight—is that they’re afraid they’re going to be turned on. And if you’re not afraid that you’re going to be turned on—meaning that you know what you like—then really it’s not that hard.|$|E
500|$|When Mears went to {{audition}} for the role, he was asked, [...] "Why do we need an actor {{as opposed to just}} a <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mask?" [...] Mears said portraying Jason is similar to Greek Mask Work, in which the mask and the actor are separate entities, and depending on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance. Mears said the energy from the actor's thoughts will be picked up by the camera. He compared his experience behind the camera to a stock car race: he is the driver and the effects team is his pit crew. As he performs, the effects team subtly suggest ways he can give the character more life on camera.|$|E

500|$|The rock monster {{climax of}} the film was {{ultimately}} dropped due to difficulties during filming. The monster, dubbed the Rockman, was a large latex rubber suit that breathed fire on command. Effects personnel smoked cigarettes and blew smoke into the suit's tubing, loading it with smoke that it would slowly emit, obscuring some obvious rubber parts. On {{the last day of}} location shooting, the Rockman began suffering mechanical problems; the suit stopped breathing fire, and the desert wind dissipated the smoke. The result, Shatner wrote, was that [...] "our guy in the silly rubber suit ultimately just looked like... well, a <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> silly rubber suit." [...] With no time to return to the location, Shatner was forced to get wide shots and hope that the setting could be reproduced in the studio, but admitted that it was likely it was not going to work for the film.|$|E
500|$|... "Night of Desirable Objects" [...] was {{the first}} episode to feature guest actor Kevin Corrigan as the mysterious Sam Weiss. To help Corrigan, Torv {{compared}} Sam Weiss to the Oracle in The Matrix, which the actor had not yet seen. Corrigan noted, [...] "It opened my mind up... So now Sam's just this regular <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bowling alley but he's {{so much more than}} that." [...] Weiss' appearance generated some rumors that he was a figment of Olivia's imagination, causing actress Anna Torv to state in a later interview that she has always believed Weiss to be [...] "100 percent real" [...] and her character's [...] "guide". The episode marked the last appearance by guest actress Meghan Markle, who plays Agent Amy Jessup. Frequent Fringe collaborator Akiva Goldsman later hinted in January 2010 that audiences have [...] "not seen the last of Agent Jessup". Other guest stars included John Savage and Charles Martin Smith, as well as Stefan Arngrim, who made his second appearance on the series.|$|E
500|$|The {{main source}} of the game's horror is Alma, a ghostly little girl. Craig Hubbard remarked that [...] "a <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mask chasing co-eds with a meat cleaver can be scary, but on some level you're {{thinking}} to yourself you could probably kick his ass if you got the drop on him...but when a spooky little girl takes out an entire Delta Force squad, how {{are you supposed to}} deal with that?" [...] While Alma has been compared to the character Samara from The Ring, Craig Hubbard stated that she [...] "... was born out of a tradition of eerie, faceless female ghosts ..." [...] and not [...] "... as an answer to any specific movie character." [...] Hubbard acknowledged that Alma [...] "... admittedly bears some visual resemblance to the ghosts in Dark Water or Séance", but [...] "... creepy little girls have been freaking [...] out since The Shining." [...] Developers Dave Matthews and Nathan Hendrickson say the name 'Alma' comes from the character Alma Mobley in Peter Straub's novel Ghost Story.|$|E

500|$|Jessie Bannon, age 15, was {{characterized}} {{to be just}} as tough, smarter, and more thoughtful than Jonny. Written as [...] "more of an egghead", she elected to spend time with Dr. Quest as Jonny did with Race, and was [...] "more in tune with Hadji". Turner conceived Jessie as cool, independent, and a strong role model for contemporary girls. Peter Lawrence took pains to ensure Jessie would not be written as [...] "a <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> skirt", and made her more mature than Jonny. Race Bannon (Jessie's father) age 38, retained his classic, laconic sense of humor and fearless, dependable nature. He retired from government work over ethical scruples with his former intelligence agency. Writers noted that Race was helplessly overprotective of Jessie, and Jonny was [...] "the boy Race never had". Race was also given a western-US accent and a knack for crafting elaborate, colorful similes. Peter Lawrence sculpted Race to be a [...] "cowboy philosopher or philosopher-warrior". Writers tasked Race with physical and self-defense training for the Quest team.|$|E
500|$|Negative reviews, on {{the other}} hand, mainly criticized the film's dark humor and the unlikeability of the main character. USA Today Claudia Puig found the film [...] "neither {{believable}} nor funny" [...] and wrote that [...] "it's tough to summon sufficiently negative language to describe the unfunny, desperate mess that is Bad Words". The Boston Globe critic Peter Keough gave the film 1 star out of 4, finding it unfunny, clichéd and offensive with an unlikeable [...] "sociopath" [...] as the main character. Richard Corliss of Time thought that the film failed to redeem Guy's character or justify his [...] "deification", ultimately making it boring and unsatisfying. Similarly, Joe Morgenstern described <b>Guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> review for The Wall Street Journal as [...] "downright vile, a self-created pariah, and funny enough for a reasonable stretch of time" [...] before the plot becomes [...] "both implausible and banal". The Globe and Mail Robert Everett-Green gave Bad Words 1 out of 4 stars, deeming it [...] "a shallow remix" [...] of offensive and clichéd characters with poor acting and [...] "mean-spirited" [...] humor.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times said, [...] "You {{put down}} your money – still less than $10 in most cities – {{and in return}} you get {{two and a half}} hours of {{spirited}} swashbuckling, and Gore Verbinski has an appropriate sense of mischief, as a well as a gift, nearly equaling those of Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg, for integrating CGI seamlessly into his cinematic compositions." [...] Empire magazine gave the film 3 stars saying [...] "Depp is once again an unmitigated joy as Captain Sparrow, delivering another eye-darting, word-slurring turn with some wonderful slapstick flourishes. Indeed, Rossio and Elliot smartly exploit these in some wonderful action set-pieces." [...] "We don’t get the predictable ‘all friends together on the same quest’ structure, and there’s a surfeit of surprises, crosses and double-crosses and cheeky character beats which stay true to the original’s anti-heroic sense of fun. After all, Jack Sparrow is a pirate, a bad <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hero’s hat, a man driven by self-gain over concern for the greater good, who will run away from a fight and cheat his ‘friends’ without a second’s thought." ...|$|E

5000|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. Travis Pickett of IGN gave it an 8.5 rating, especially praising Trey Parker and Matt Stone {{for managing}} to contrast the episode {{with the actual}} Simpsons with themes like Cartman performing fellatio on [...] "some <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> alley", while respectfully paying their dues.|$|R
500|$|Critics lauded the {{development}} of the storyline between Shane and Rick. Writing for Best Week Ever, Dan Hopper stated that it presented a cold and eerie outlook {{on the future of the}} two men. Nate Rawlings of Time evaluated their physical confrontation as [...] "darn good", and Alex Crumb of The Faster Times called it [...] "wholly satisfying". Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich commended the fight scene; [...] "The Shane/Rick fight was great, a brilliantly extended scuffle that started out with an air of boys-will-be-boys pettiness but quickly escalated into something genuinely homicidal." [...] Goldman summated on the scene: [...] "Of course, it was also gratifying to finally see that conflict turn physical, with a fight we've been waiting to see for a long time. Rick vs. Shane was appropriately brutal and did a very good job of representing the two men's different tactics—Rick was no doubt a formidable and dangerous <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fight, wailing on Shane with a series of punches. But Shane was going for the kill, using anything he could grab as a weapon, as he shoved a motorcycle onto Rick at one point and then threw a massive wrench at him in an effective, 'Holy S**t!' moment." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{seeing the}} {{portrayal}} of Yellowjacket in Ant-Man, the antagonist of the film, McMillian noted, It's hardly a secret that Marvel Studios {{has a bit of}} a problem when it comes to offering up exciting characters for their heroes to fight against ... villains generally fall into one of two camps. There's the Unstoppable Monster ... or there's the Professional White <b>Guy</b> <b>In</b> <b>A</b> Suit With An Ego ... No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into, they share one common purpose: evil. The motivations for evil likely differ—although, invariably, they fall under the umbrella of 'misguided belief in a greater good that doesn't exist'—but that really doesn't matter, because without fail, there will be so little time in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations, meaning that to all intents and purposes, the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity and little else ... The strange thing about this is that Marvel's comic books offer a number of wonderful, colorful bad guys who could step outside the above parameters and offer an alternative to the formulaic villains audiences have gotten used to (and arguably bored with) ... In future movies, we can only hope [...] treated {{in such a way that}} their freak flags are allowed to fly free.|$|E
500|$|After {{signing with}} the label, Bemis began writing songs for his band's Doghouse debut. [...] Bemis {{went into the}} studio with Florida {{producer}} Paul Trust. [...] They recorded 3 songs that were not released although {{one of the songs}} entitled [...] "Spider Song" [...] would later appear on a Doghouse compilation. [...] With tremendous self-created pressure, he threw himself into pushing the sonic boundaries of the band and maturing their sound, incorporating elements of math-rock, indie-pop and theatrical pomp. He and Linder also started the search for a producer. The two met several producers but eventually decided on Tim O'Heir and Stephen Trask. Bemis struggled with different ideas for the record and decided the album should focus on [...] "the artistic struggle, the fact that every creative person has this sick ambition to affect some sort of change in society with their art, to be more than just a <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> band or a poet or a sculptor." [...] Bemis originally intended the album to be a rock opera with a full script, narration, and a cast of characters. It was tentatively titled Zona! Zona! However, Bemis became overwhelmed by the entire process of writing and playing most of the instruments and had a breakdown.|$|E

500|$|Feige {{stated that}} Steve Rogers would be paired with other {{characters}} from The Avengers like Black Widow and Nick Fury, because unlike Tony Stark and Thor, who {{could return to}} their own supporting casts, Rogers had nowhere else to go, [...] "and it just made sense {{that he was the}} one that stayed with what remains of the Avengers at the end of the film." [...] The writers considered including Hawkeye, but [...] "he didn't have enough to do and suddenly it seemed like we were giving him short shrift", leading all of his parts to be fulfilled by Black Widow, and Joe Russo added that Jeremy Renner's schedule could not be worked out for him to appear. As to why the Red Skull from The First Avenger did not appear in The Winter Soldier, Joe Russo explained, [...] "I know we have a <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> computer, but the tone we were chasing was sort of that conspiracy thriller. And we wanted to try and ground the movie as much as we could. And Red Skull, he's a fantastical character and didn't necessarily fit for Cap 2 and especially because it was about the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. Certainly Hydra exists and that's his legacy, but there's something interesting about the fact that his legacy outlived the skull. And they're still dealing with the demons of it, but not necessarily him." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{takes place}} {{simultaneously}} with {{the events of}} The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2, the latter of which is set {{six months after the}} events of Iron Man, Clark Gregg, who appeared in Iron Man and Iron Man 2 as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson, reprised the role in Thor. About his role in Thor he stated, [...] "Agent Coulson was one of the guys who wasn't really in the comic books, and he [...] a very kind of small role in Iron Man. And I was just very lucky that they chose to expand that character and [...] to put him more into the universe of it." [...] After signing on to appear as Clint Barton / Hawkeye in The Avengers, Jeremy Renner made a cameo appearance as the character during a scene in Thor. Branagh said that they [...] "were always going to have a <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> basket above the action where Thor breaks in the S.H.I.E.L.D. camp", and that he was thrilled when the producers told him they wanted to use Renner's Hawkeye for that role. The film ends with a post-credits scene featuring Loki, watching as Erik Selvig and Nick Fury discuss the Tesseract. The scene was directed by Joss Whedon, who directed The Avengers. Stellan Skarsgård, who played Selvig, said the scene was not included when he first read the screenplay for Thor, and that he was sent pages for the scene after agreeing to appear in The Avengers.|$|E
500|$|Williams {{said the}} album was never {{finished}} {{and because of the}} demand for the record, the distributors insisted the album be completed, otherwise they would cancel the album's orders. This resulted in Dr. Dre mixing the album and inserting the skits within 48 hours, which enabled the album to be released. Rolling Stone writer Jonathan Gold described how Dr. Dre produced a beat from scratch to complete instrumental: [...] "Dre may find something he likes from an old drum break, loop it and gradually replace each part with a better tom-tom sound, a kick-drum sound he adores, until the beat bears the same relationship to the original that the Incredible Hulk does to Bill Bixby". Gold also described how the track progressed with other musicians adding to the song, stating [...] "A bass player wanders in, unpacks his instrument and pops a funky two-note bass line over the beat, then leaves to watch CNN, though his two notes keep looping into infinity. A smiling <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> striped jersey plays a nasty one-fingered melody on an old Minimoog synthesizer that's been obsolete since 1982, and Dre scratches in a sort of surfadelic munching noise, and then from his well-stocked Akai MPC60 samples comes a shriek, a spare piano chord, an ejaculation from the first Beastie's record -- [...] "Let me clear my throat"—and the many-layered groove is happening, bumping, breathing, almost loud enough to see." ...|$|E
