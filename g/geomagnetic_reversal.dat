5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>reversal</b> (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field was weakening, which could precede a reversal of the north and south magnetic poles, and the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012.|$|E
5|$|Lieder {{described}} Planet X as roughly {{four times}} the size of the Earth, and said that its closest approach would occur on May 27, 2003, resulting in the Earth's rotation ceasing for exactly 5.9 terrestrial days. This would be followed by the Earth's pole destabilising in a pole shift (a physical pole shift, with the Earth's pole physically moving, rather than a <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>reversal)</b> caused by magnetic attraction between the Earth's core and the magnetism of the passing planet. This in turn would disrupt the Earth's magnetic core and lead to subsequent displacement of the Earth's crust.|$|E
5|$|Although {{generally}} Earth's {{field is}} approximately dipolar, with an axis that is nearly {{aligned with the}} rotational axis, occasionally the North and South geomagnetic poles trade places. Evidence for these geomagnetic reversals {{can be found in}} basalts, sediment cores taken from the ocean floors, and seafloor magnetic anomalies. Reversals occur nearly randomly in time, with intervals between reversals ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. The most recent <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>reversal,</b> called the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, occurred about 780,000 years ago. A related phenomenon, a geomagnetic excursion, amounts to an incomplete reversal, with no change in polarity. The Laschamp event is an example of an excursion, it having occurred during the last ice age (41,000 years ago).|$|E

500|$|Timescales for ice cores {{from the}} same {{hemisphere}} can usually be synchronised using layers that include material from volcanic events.

500|$|Most {{scientific}} estimates, however, {{say that}} geomagnetic reversals take between 1,000 and 10,000 years to complete, {{and do not}} start on any particular date. Furthermore, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that the solar maximum would peak in late 2013 or 2014, {{and that it would}} be fairly weak, with a below-average number of sunspots. In any case, there was no scientific evidence linking a solar maximum to a <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>reversal,</b> which is driven by forces entirely within the Earth. Instead, a solar maximum would be mostly notable for its effects on satellite and cellular phone communications. David Morrison attributed the rise of the solar storm idea to physicist and science popularizer Michio Kaku, who claimed in an interview with Fox News that a solar peak in 2012 could be disastrous for orbiting satellites, and to NASA's headlining a 2006 webpage as [...] "Solar Storm Warning", a term later repeated on several doomsday pages.|$|E

30|$|If the Sun’s {{magnetic}} field flipping {{coincides with the}} <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>reversals</b> on Earth, there is little geo{{magnetic field}} protection during the switching process of between 5000 – 10, 000  yr and the Earth will concurrently receive high UV-B emissions and galactic cosmic ray incursions during these transitions between field flipping and rotation of the solar dynamo within thermonuclear production.

This would also be a time of high galactic cosmic ray incursions and atmospheric ionization. If there were concurrent changes to the Sun’s gravitational pull on the solar system, it would not be surprising that impact crater periodicities could be largely synchronous with <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>reversals,</b> sea-level fluctuations and marine extinctions (Table  1).|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{geophysical}} event which can affect [...] production: geomagnetic reversals and polarity excursions. In a <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>reversal,</b> the Earth's geomagnetic field weakens and stays weak for thousands of years during the transition to the opposite magnetic polarity and then regains strength as the reversal completes. A polarity excursion, which can be either global or local, is a shorter-lived version of a <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>reversal.</b> A local excursion would not significantly affect 14C production. During either a <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>reversal</b> or a global polarity excursion, [...] production increases during the period when the geomagnetic field is weak.
