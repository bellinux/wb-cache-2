5|$|A {{comparative}} study of the amino acid composition of eleven Portuguese wild edible mushroom species showed Boletus edulis to have the highest total amino acid content, about 2.3g per 100g of dried mushroom. This total includes {{a full complement of}} 20 essential and nonessential amino acids. Analysis of the <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> (that is, those not bound up in protein) revealed glutamine and alanine to be the principal amino acids (each about 25% of total compounds); a separate analysis concluded that lysine is another predominant compound.|$|E
5|$|However, not all peptide {{bonds are}} formed in this way. In a few cases, {{peptides}} are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide glutathione {{is an essential}} part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> In the first step, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamic acid through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible {{inhibition}} {{is different}} from irreversible enzyme inactivation. Irreversible inhibitors are generally specific for one class of enzyme and do not inactivate all proteins; they do not function by destroying protein structure but by specifically altering the active site of their target. For example, extremes of pH or temperature usually cause denaturation of all protein structure, {{but this is a}} non-specific effect. Similarly, some non-specific chemical treatments destroy protein structure: for example, heating in concentrated hydrochloric acid will hydrolyse the peptide bonds holding proteins together, releasing <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b>|$|E

These mutants contained total <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> pool contents that were considerably {{higher than those}} found in the wild-type strain. Diaminopimelic acid accounted for 10 to 20 % of the total <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> pools, depending on the individual mutant and its culture growth phase, whereas diaminopimelic acid contained in the wild-type strain accounted for only 0. 5 % of the total <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> pool...|$|R

25|$|Aspartame is a {{methyl ester}} of the {{dipeptide}} {{of the natural}} amino acids L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine.

40|$|<b>Free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> {{contents}} in {{skin mucus}} extracts were analysed in sexually undinerentiated yellow eels, female yellow eels and {{male and female}} silver eels trapped {{at the same time}} from the same freshwater location. Total <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> contents in skin mucus were similar in the three groups of sexually differentiated eels (16. 2 – 18. 2 μM/g dry weight). In sexually undinerentiated yellow eels, total content was higher (39. 6 μM/g dry weight). <b>Free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> composition of skin mucus from male and female silver eels were similar. Compared with the two groups of yellow eels, main differences were found in taurine and non-essential <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> relative contents. Taurine, glycine and alanine concentrations in skin mucus decreased as the level of sexual maturity of the eel increased. Possible influences of nutritional and hormonal factors on the <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> content of eel skin mucus are discussed.

Also after that of 10 mg GABOB, it shows a slight decrease. 2) During metrazol convulsion, <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> nitrogen content decreases markedly. 3) The intravenous injection of 100 mg GABOB before metrazol convulsion does not influence the variation of <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> nitrogen content during convulsion. Positively after that of 10 mg, the decrease of <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> nitrogen content by cardiazol convulsion is restrained slightly. 4) By intravenous injection of 100 mg GABOB., ChE activity is accelerated but by that of 10 mg, it is rather restrained. 5) During convulsion, the ChE activity in cerebral cortex decreases markedly. 6) In this case, if 100 mg GABOB is given intravenously before the intravenous injection of metrazol, in the maximum stadium of convulsion antagonistic function is fairly found, but in the latter stadium of convultion it is scarcely influenced. In case of 10 mg GABOB intravenous injection, ChE activity decreases by metrazol convulsion while it {{shows no sign of}} being influenced in the maximum stadium of convulsion...|$|R

25|$|Of the Free Amino Nitrogen (FAN) {{that make}} up YAN, the amino acids arginine, proline and {{glutamine}} are the most abundant followed by alanine, threonine, serine and aspartic acid in much smaller concentrations though trace amounts of most known amino acids {{can be found in}} grape must. Proline is usually the most concentrated and can represent up to 30% of the total amount of amino acids.

25|$|YAN is a {{measurement}} of the primary organic (<b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids)</b> and inorganic (ammonia and ammonium) sources of nitrogen that can be assimilated by S. cerevisiae. There are several nitrogenous compounds found in must and wine including peptides, larger proteins, amides, biogenic amines, pyridines, purines and nucleic acids but these cannot be directly used by yeast for metabolism. Taken together, the total nitrogen content of grape must can range from 60 to 2400mg of nitrogen per liter, however not all of this nitrogen will be assimilable. The lack of protease enzymes, which break down larger peptides into smaller components, that can work outside the cell, limits {{the size of the}} molecules that yeast can use as a source for nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|Proteins {{account for}} 8% to 12% of dried green coffee beans. A {{majority}} of the proteins are of the 11-S storage kind (alpha – component of 32 kDa, beta – component of 22 kDa), {{most of which are}} degraded to <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> during maturation of green coffee beans. Further, 11-S storage proteins are degraded to their individual amino acids under roasting temperature, thus are an additional source of bitter components due to generation of Maillard reaction products. High temperature and oxygen concentration and low pH degrade 11-S storage proteins of green coffee beans to low-molecular-weight peptides and amino acids. The degradation is accelerated in the presence of organic acids such as chlorogenic acids and their derivatives. Other proteins include enzymes, such as catalase and polyphenol oxidase, which are important for the maturation of green coffee beans. Mature coffee contains <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> (4.0mg amino acid/g robusta coffee and up to 4.5mg amino acid/g arabica coffee). In Coffea arabica, alanine is the amino acid with the highest concentration, i.e. 1.2mg/g, followed by asparagine of 0.66mg/g, whereas in C. robusta, alanine is present at a concentration of 0.8mg/g and asparagine at 0.36mg/g. The free hydrophobic amino acids in fresh green coffee beans contribute to the unpleasant taste, making it impossible to prepare a desirable beverage with such compounds. In fresh green coffee from Peru, these concentrations have been determined as: isoleucine 81mg/kg, leucine 100mg/kg, valine 93mg/kg, tyrosine 81mg/kg, phenylalanine 133mg/kg. The concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (a neurotransmitter) has been determined between 143mg/kg and 703mg/kg in green coffee beans from Tanzania. Roasted coffee beans do not contain any free amino acids; the amino acids in green coffee beans are degraded under roasting temperature to Maillard products (reaction products between the aldehyde group of sugar and the alpha-amino group of the amino acids). Further, diketopiperazines, e.g. cyclo(proline-proline), cyclo(proline-leucine), and cyclo(proline-isoleucine), are generated from the corresponding amino acids, and are the major source of the bitter taste of roasted coffee. The bitter flavor of diketopiperazines is perceptible at around 20mg/liter of water. The content of diketopiperazines in espresso is about 20 to 30mg, which is responsible for its bitterness.|$|E
40|$|International audienceTemporal {{changes in}} <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> pools are {{examined}} in starved and cold-exposed (10 degrees C) beetles (Alphitobius diaperinus) (control beetles; 4, 7, 14, 28 and 56 days of cold-exposure). The range of individual responses {{and the effect}} of gender on survival and <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> levels are evaluated. Females survived significantly longer (Lt(50) and Lt(90)) than males under stressing conditions. Pro, Gln, Ala, Arg and Thr are the major components of the <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> pool in the whole body of adult beetles. Multivariate analysis indicates that the duration of exposure explains most of the observed variation in <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> levels, while sex effect is not significant. Moreover, <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> levels fluctuate strongly within each sampled date, revealing a high inter-individual heterogeneity. However, this heterogeneity decreases after four weeks of cold-exposure and starvation. The increase in Ala level and the concomitant decrease of Pro after four weeks suggest that Pro might be an important fuel for metabolism when fat reserves are reduced. We conclude that changes in <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> pools are due to a combination of reduced individual heterogeneity, cold-acclimation and <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> degradation for energetic purpose...|$|R

25|$|Upon {{completion}} of feeding, the mosquito will withdraw her proboscis, {{and as the}} gut fills up, the stomach lining secretes a peritrophic membrane that surrounds the blood. This membrane keeps the blood separate from {{anything else in the}} stomach. However, like certain other insects that survive on dilute, purely liquid diets, notably many of the Hemiptera, many adult mosquitoes must excrete unwanted aqueous fractions even as they feed. (See the photograph of a feeding Anopheles stephensi: Note that the excreted droplet patently is not whole blood, being far more dilute). As long as they are not disturbed, this permits mosquitoes to continue feeding until they have accumulated a full meal of nutrient solids. As a result, a mosquito replete with blood can continue to absorb sugar, even as the blood meal is slowly digested {{over a period of several}} days. Once blood is in the stomach, the midgut of the female synthesizes proteolytic enzymes that hydrolyze the blood proteins into <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> These are used as building blocks for the synthesis of egg yolk proteins.|$|E
