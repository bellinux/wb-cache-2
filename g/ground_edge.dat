The blade also has a hollow <b>ground</b> <b>edge</b> throughout the blade. The hilt is shaped like the letter Y, with its length up to 25 cm. The moderate overall length of the sword is approximately 70 to 79 cm. The blade of the sword is usually made of pamor (pattern welding or Damascus) steel.|$|E
5000|$|Schmidt himself {{worked out}} a second, more elegant, scheme for {{producing}} the complex figure needed for the correcting plate. [...] A thin glass disk with a perfectly polished accurate flat form was placed on a heavy metal pan. The upper edge of the pan was ground at a precise angle or bevel based on the coefficient of elasticity of the particular type of glass plate that was being used. The glass plate was sealed to the <b>ground</b> <b>edge</b> of the pan, then a vacuum pump was used to exhaust the air until a particular negative pressure had been achieved. This caused the glass plate to warp slightly. The exposed side was then ground and polished to a perfect flat. When the vacuum was released, the plate sprang back until its bottom surface was again plane, while the upper surface had the correct figure. Schmidt's vacuum figuring method is rarely used today. The glass plate will usually break if bent enough to generate a curve for telescopes of focal ratio f/2.5 or faster. [...] Also, for fast focal ratios, the curve obtained is not sufficiently exact and requires additional hand correction.|$|E

5000|$|This Museo Galileo {{microscope}} is {{a compound}} microscope made of cardboard, leather and wood, and is inserted in an iron support with three curved legs. The outer tube {{is covered in}} green vellum decorated with gold tooling. There are three lenses (an objective lens, a field lens, and an eyepiece), all double-convex. The objective measures 11 mm in diameter and has a thickness of 3.5 mm. The glass is clear with few imperfections; the edge is ground {{and there are some}} fine chips. The field lens (diameter 30 mm, thickness 4.7 mm) is in a cell that pushes {{into the bottom of the}} inner tube. The glass is amber-green, with air bubbles, and has a <b>ground</b> <b>edge</b> that is chipped; the eyepiece, with an aperture of 24 mm, also has some bubbles; it is protected by a wooden cap that screws onto the mount. The instrument is attributed to Giuseppe Campani, an Italian optician and astronomer who lived in Rome during the latter half of the 17th century, known as an expert lens grinder and instrument maker. Compound microscopes such as this first appeared in Europe around 1620 including one demonstrated by Cornelis Drebbel in London (around 1621) and one exhibited in Rome in 1624.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Gentex Corporation is {{developing}} a new style of interior rear-view mirror where the substrate sits proud of the mirror housing. Federal regulations require at least a 2. 5 mm radius of curvature {{around the perimeter of}} the substrate, and a grinding operation has been determined to form the radius in the substrate. During the process development, scratches have been observed along the surface of the <b>ground</b> <b>edge.</b> The purpose of this study was to utilize design of experiment (DOE) techniques to determine the process parameters that most significantly affected the presence of the scratches. METHODS: Feed rate, tool speed, and tool rotational direction were tested using a 23 full factorial design with two replicates. A vertical CNC and a diamond abrasive tool were used to form the <b>ground</b> <b>edge</b> into the substrate. Surface scratches on the ground surface were measured using an optical microscope. ANALYSES: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the data from the study. The response variable was the number of scratches present on a ground substrate. RESULTS: Using a significance level of α = 0. 05, the only significant factor that affected the presence of the surface scratches was the tool rotational direction with a p-value of 0. 013. It was determined that up-grinding produced less surface scratches than down-grinding. There were no significant interactions between factors. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that tool rotational direction significantly affected the number of surface scratches on a substrate, and the feed rate and tool speed were insignificant. To reduce the occurrence of the surface scratches, up-grinding should be employed...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} study directed at finding a deflector ramp that will reduce to {{an acceptable level}} the ground winds under the exhaust jet of the 80 by 120 Foot Wind Tunnel at NASA Ames Center is described. A one-fifieth scale model of the full-scale facility was used to investigate how the jet flow field was modified by the various design parameters of the ramp. It was concluded that the ground winds were alleviated sufficiently by a ramp with end plates located next to the wind tunnel building along the <b>ground</b> <b>edge</b> of the exhaust opening. At full scale, the ramp should have a slant length of 7. 62 m (25 ft) or more, and would be elevated at about 45 degrees to the ground plane.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is the study of}} the effect of the {{finishing}} of the edge of glass when it has a structural function. Experimental investigations carried out for glass specimens are presented. Various series of annealed glass beam were tested, with cut edge and with <b>ground</b> <b>edge.</b> The glass specimens are tested in four-point bending performing flaw detection on the tested specimens after failure, in order to determine glass strength. As a result, bending strength values are obtained for each specimen. Determining some physical parameter as the depth of the flaw and the mirror radius of the fracture, after the failure of a glass element, it could be possible to calculate the failure strength of that. The experimental results were analyzed with the LEFM theory and the glass strength was analyzed with a statistical study using two-parameter Weibull distribution fitting quite well the failure stress data. The results obtained constitute a validation of the theoretical models and show the influence of the edge processing on the failure strength of the glass. Furthermore, series with different sizes were tested in order to evaluate the size effect...|$|E
40|$|In a {{compartment}} fire, the breakage {{and possible}} fallout {{of a window}} glass has {{a significant impact on}} the fire dynamics. The thermal breakage of glass depends on various parameters such as glass type, edge shading, edges conditions and constraints on the glass. The purpose of the present study is to investigate some of the key parameters affecting the thermal breakage of window glass in fire conditions using a recently developed and validated computer tool. Fallout is not within the scope of this study. Different boundary conditions of the glass pane (unconstrained and constrained) subjected to fire radiant heat are investigated. The analysis shows that to prevent glass thermal breakage, it is important to provide enough spacing between the frame and glass pane to accommodate the thermal expansion, and constraints on the glass structure should be avoided. The zones where the glass is likely to crack first are shown. The study also quantifies the effects of glass edge conditions on its thermal breakage in fire conditions; such analysis has not been reported in the literature due to its complexity and the statistical nature of edge flaws. The results show that an ordinary float glass mostly used in windows, with the “as-cut” edge condition would break later and is stronger than a <b>ground</b> <b>edge</b> or polished edge glass for the scenarios investigated. The study demonstrates how a predictive tool could be employed for a better understanding of thermal breakage of window glass in fires and for design guidance...|$|E

40|$|A {{new design}} method is {{proposed}} for the structural, loadbearing applications of glass with <b>ground</b> <b>edges.</b> It is shown that all the strength characteristics of glass relevant to structural engineering {{can be explained by}} the cracks present in the glass and can be analysed using fracture mechanics. The proposed method takes a 'design crack' as the basis for design, rather than an allowable stress, as in current approaches with which it is compared. This paper deals with the determination of the strength of glass elements; it does not address buckling problems, nor does it consider the concepts of alternative load paths. The role of crack size design within the wider philosophy of limit state design is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of stress corrosion {{on the edge}} strength becomes important when designing structural glass elements. As the load duration of the design wind load (600 s) or the design temperature load {{is larger than the}} common load duration during testing the glass edge, a strength model must be used {{to take into account the}} load duration properly. In such a model, both short term parameters (i. e. the flaw geometry and depth) and stress corrosion parameters are involved. The stress corrosion parameters strongly depend upon the environment, especially the temperature and the humidity. In this study, the latter two are kept constant, for the testing at high stress rate (50 MPa/s), to determine the short term parameters as well as for the testing at low stress rate (2 MPa/s), to determine the stress corrosion parameters. The geometry factor and the stress corrosion parameters were determined for arrised and <b>ground</b> <b>edges...</b>|$|R
