Hardy finished two slices in the time limit and then proceeded to vomit on MVP, who didn't finish any, which won Hardy the competition.|$|E
5|$|Margret Reed {{had managed}} to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, {{to the delight of}} her children, but by January they were facing {{starvation}} and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning {{that it would be better}} to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide-roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graveses came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b>|$|E

In March 1869, Livingstone suffered from pneumonia and arrived in Ujiji to find his supplies stolen. He was coming down with cholera and had tropical ulcers on his feet, so he was again forced to rely on slave traders to get him as far as Bambara—where he was caught by the wet season. With no supplies, Livingstone <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> his meals in a roped-off enclosure for the entertainment of the locals in return for food.|$|E

25|$|Chikatilo's {{parents were}} both {{collective}} farm labourers {{who lived in}} a one-room hut and who received no wages for their work, but instead received the right to cultivate a plot of land behind the family hut. The family seldom had sufficient food; Chikatilo himself later claimed not to have eaten bread until the age of twelve, adding that he and his family often <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> grass and leaves in an effort to stave off hunger. Throughout his childhood, Chikatilo was repeatedly told by his mother Anna that prior to his birth, an older brother of his named Stepan had, at age 4, been kidnapped and cannibalized by starving neighbours, although it has never been independently established whether this incident actually occurred, or if a Stepan Chikatilo even existed. Nonetheless, Chikatilo recalled his childhood as being blighted by poverty, ridicule, hunger, and war.|$|E

It gives a graphic insight into the chaos and confusion of the five-day crisis, and shows how the nuclear industry, the regulators and the government all [...] "initially played down the risks, then <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> their words". Some 144,000 people were evacuated, but Walker points out that [...] "if {{the full extent of}} the core meltdown had been known at the time, hundreds of thousands more would have been told to go".

McCartney got past customs by saying [...] "You know who I am", {{but he and}} Evans were not allowed into a hotel restaurant in Nice because they [...] "didn't look the part", and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> dinner in Evans' room. Because the money they had with them had been spent on clothes (NEMS was supposed to send them more), they arranged for credit over two nights in a nightclub. Evans: [...] "We took advantage of our credit standing, as money had still not arrived from England. News about Paul's [...] visit to the club the previous night had spread, and the place was jammed. Now Paul, being a generous sort of person, had built up quite a bar bill, when {{the manager of the}} club arrived demanding that we pay immediately. On explaining who Paul was and what had happened, he answered, 'You either pay the bill, or I call the police.' It certainly looked like {{we were going to get}} thrown in jail. It was ironical, sitting in a club with a millionaire, unable to pay the bill." ...|$|E
500|$|Britten Austin tempers his {{praise for}} Bellman's realism with the {{observation}} that the effects are chosen to work in song, rather than to be strictly correct or even possible. Thus in Epistle 72, [...] "Glimmande Nymf", the memorable rainbow with its glowing colours [...] "of purple, gold and green" [...] is seen after nightfall. He comments [...] "Never mind. It is a beautiful scene, even if its chronology calls for much poetic license." [...] Or in Epistle 80, [...] "Liksom en herdinna", the farmer is for some reason going to or coming from market on a Sunday, when the market would be closed; and his cart [...] "heavy on staggering wheel" [...] must have been absurdly full if it contained chickens, lambs, and calves all at once. But {{it had to be}} a Sunday to allow Ulla Winblad to step out of her swaying chaise, on an outing from the city. Britten Austin remarks that [...] "until such solecisms are actually pointed out, one does not even notice them." [...] It is the same with the meals, which would cause [...] "terrible indigestion" [...] if the listener actually <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> them, but [...] "as a feast for mind, eye and ear they are highly satisfactory", the imagination filled with [...] "all the poetic wealth" [...] that Bellman provides.|$|E

500|$|In 1983, Rangel became {{chair of}} the Select Committee on Narcotics, which {{solidified}} his position as a leading strategist on this perennially important issue to him. [...] Rangel kept the committee going, {{in the face of}} the usual pressure to disband special committees. [...] He battled against proposed cutbacks in the federal anti-drug budget, and advocated increased grants to states and cities for better shelters for the homeless. [...] Rangel's amendments providing increased funding for state and local law enforcement were included in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. [...] He traveled to countries in Central and South America and elsewhere to inspect the sources of drugs and the law enforcement efforts against them; Ebony magazine termed Rangel [...] "a front-line general in the war against drugs." [...] Rangel said [...] "We need outrage!", making reference to the slow reaction by both government and religious leaders to the epidemics of crack cocaine, heroin, PCP, and other drugs that hit American streets during the 1980s. [...] He believed that legalizing drugs would represent [...] "moral and political suicide". [...] Nor did he refrain from criticizing those most affected by drugs, saying that Hispanic and black teenagers had no sense of self-preservation, and that drug dealers were so stupid that they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> in fast-food places because they could not read a menu. [...] By 1988, Rangel was saying that President Ronald Reagan had not done enough in the war on drugs, but that First Lady Nancy Reagan's [...] "Just Say No" [...] campaign had been quite valuable. [...] The narcotics committee itself was termed possibly the most important select committee of its time. [...] The Washington Post said Rangel was [...] "in a powerful position to shape policy on an issue at the top of the nation's agenda." [...] He would remain as {{chair of the}} committee through 1993, when it was abolished along with other House select committees.|$|E
