40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is {{the most}} common lethal inherited disease in the Caucasian population with an incidence of- 1 in 2, 500 live births. Pulmonary complications of CF, which are the most morbid aspects of the disease, are caused by primary abnormalities in epithelial cells that lead to impaired mucociliary clearance. One potential therapeutic strategy is to reconstitute expression of the CF gene in airway epithelia by somatic gene transfer. To this end, we have developed an animal model of the human airway using bronchial xenografts and have tested the efficiency of in vivo <b>retroviral</b> <b>gene</b> transfer. Using the LacZ reporter gene, we find the efficiency of in vivo <b>retroviral</b> <b>gene</b> transfer to be dramatically dependent on the regenerative and mitotic state of the epithelium. Within an undifferentiated regenerating epithelium in which 40 % of nuclei labeled with BrdU, 5 - 10 % <b>retroviral</b> <b>gene</b> transfer was obtained. In contrast, no gene transfer was noted in a fully differentiated epithelium in which 1 % of nuclei labeled with BrdU. These findings suggest that <b>retroviral</b> mediated <b>gene</b> transfer to the airway in vivo may be feasible if the proper regenerative state can be induced. (J. Clin.

40|$|The {{rescue of}} {{infectious}} virus from nonproducer BH RSV(-) cells by chick cellular DNA was attempted {{in order to}} investigate the functional state of endogenous and exogenous <b>retroviral</b> <b>genes</b> integrated within the cellular DNA.

40|$|Biosensors {{based on}} the {{principle}} of Förster (or fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET) have been developed to visualize spatio-temporal dynamics of signalling molecules in living cells. Many of them adopt a backbone of intramolecular FRET biosensor with a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) as donor and acceptor, respectively. However, there remains the difficulty of establishing cells stably expressing FRET biosensors with a YFP and CFP pair by lentiviral or <b>retroviral</b> <b>gene</b> transfer, due to the high incidence of recombination between YFP and CFP genes. To address this, we examined the effects of codon-diversification of YFP on the recombination of FRET biosensors introduced by lentivirus or retrovirus. The YFP gene that was fully codon-optimized to E. coli evaded the recombination in lentiviral or <b>retroviral</b> <b>gene</b> transfer, but the partially codon-diversified YFP did not. Further, the length of spacer between YFP and CFP genes clearly affected recombination efficiency, suggesting that the intramolecular template switching occurred in the reverse-transcription process. The simple mathematical model reproduced the experimental data sufficiently, yielding a recombination rate of 0. 002 - 0. 005 per base. Together, these results show that the codon-diversified YFP is a useful tool for expressing FRET biosensors by lentiviral or <b>retroviral</b> <b>gene</b> transfer...|$|R

While this approach is faster and less expensive than generating transgenic mice with macrophage-specific promoters and applicable to a wider array of mouse models, it has been hampered by two major drawbacks: labor-intensive cloning procedures involved in generating retroviral vectors for each gene of interest and low viral titers. Here we describe the construction of a MSCV-based retroviral vector that can serve as an acceptor vector for commercially available Cre-lox-compatible donor vectors.

40|$|Abstract: There {{have been}} major changes since the {{incidents}} of leukemia development in X-SCID patients after the treatments using <b>retroviral</b> <b>gene</b> therapy. Due {{to the risk}} of oncogenesis caused by retroviral insertional activation of host genes, most of the efforts focused on the lentiviral therapies. However, a relative clonal dominance was detected in a patient with �-thalassemia Major, two years after the subject received genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells using lentiviral vectors. This disappointing result of the recent clinical trial using lentiviral vector tells us that the current and most advanced vector systems does not have enough safety. In this review, various safety features that have been tried for the <b>retroviral</b> <b>gene</b> therapy are introduced and the possible new ways of improvements are discussed. Additional feature of chromatin insulators, co-transduction of a suicidal gene under the control of an inducible promoter, conditional expression of the transgene only in appropriate target cells, targeted transduction, cell type-specific expression, targeted local administration, splitting of the viral genome, and site specific insertion of retroviral vector are discussed here...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Cancer <b>gene</b> therapy by <b>retroviral</b> vectors {{is mainly}} {{limited by the}} level of transduction. <b>Retroviral</b> <b>gene</b> {{transfer}} requires target cell division. Cell synchronization, obtained by drugs inducing a reversible inhibition of DNA synthesis, could therefore be proposed to precondition target cells to <b>retroviral</b> <b>gene</b> transfer. We tested whether drug-mediated cell synchronization could enhance the transfer efficiency of a retroviral-mediated gene encoding herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV- tk) in two colon cancer cell lines, DHDK 12 and HT 29. Methods Synchronization was induced by methotrexate (MTX), aracytin (ara-C) or aphidicolin. Gene transfer efficiency was assessed by the level of HSV-TK expression. Transduced cells were driven by ganciclovir (GCV) towards apoptosis that was assessed using annexin V labeling by quantitative flow cytometry. Results DHDK 12 and HT 29 cells were synchronized in S phase with MTX but not ara-C or aphidicolin. In synchronized DHDK 12 and HT 29 cells, the HSV-TK transduction rates were 2 and 1. 5 -fold higher than those obtained in control cells, respectively. Furthermore, the rate of apoptosis was increased two-fold in MTX-treated DHDK 12 cells after treatment with GCV. Conclusions Our findings indicate that MTX-mediated synchronization of target cells allowed a significant improvement of <b>retroviral</b> HSV- tk <b>gene</b> transfer, resulting in an increased cell apoptosis in response to GCV. Pharmacological control of cell cycle may thus be a useful strategy to optimize the efficiency of retroviral-mediated cancer gene therapy. </p...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to characterize the class-specific pattern of <b>retroviral</b> <b>gene</b> expression in NOD/Lt beta cells versus a related, but diabetes-resistant strain, NON/Lt. Electron microscopic comparison of beta cells from both strains indicated low constitutive expression of the intracisternal type A (IAP) retroviral class. However, NOD beta cells, in contrast to NON beta cells, expressed an additional intracisternal retroviral form resembling a type C particle. Antibodies against both IAP and type C were detected in NOD, with the humoral response to type C, but not IAP, preceding decline in beta cell function. RNA was extracted from freshly isolated islets from NOD and NON males. Comparative Northern blot analysis of total type C <b>retroviral</b> <b>gene</b> expression using a gag-pol DNA probe corroborated expression of endogenous type C proviruses in both NOD and NON islet cells and thymus. Use of class-specific retroviral probes identified the class of expressed endogenous retrovirus distinguishing the two inbred strains. The single ecotropic provirus present in both the NOD and NON genome (Emv- 30) was not expressed in islets or thymus of either strain. Comparison of endogenous xenotropic provirus content by Southern blot analysis revealed two unique xenotropic loci (Xmv- 65, - 66) in NOD; 8. 4 and 3. 0 kb xenotropic envelope (env) RNA transcripts were detected in NOD, but not NON islets and thymus. NON contained three xenotropic loci common to other inbred strains (Xmv- 21, - 25, and - 28). Both strains were partially characterized for content of recombinant (polytropic and modified polytropic) proviruses. IAP RNA expression was common to both NOD and NON islets and hence could not be specifically associated with the unique intracisternal type C particle found in NOD, but not NON beta cells. In conclusion, this study shows that expression of xenotropic type C but not IAP distinguishes retroviral activity in NOD/Lt versus NON/Lt beta cells. The potential pathogenic role of <b>retroviral</b> <b>gene</b> expression in NOD beta cells is discussed...|$|R

Results To address this issue, we have developed a <b>retroviral</b> <b>gene</b> trap vector that can target genes expressed in undifferentiated ES cells. This gene trap vector harbors both GFP and Neo reporter genes. G- 418 drug resistance was used to select ES clones in which the vector was integrated into transcriptionally active loci. This was then followed by GFP FACS profiling to identify ES clones with reduced GFP fluorescence and, hence, reduced transcriptional activity when ES cells differentiate. Reduced expression of the GFP reporter in six of three hundred ES clones in our pilot screening was confirmed to be down-regulated by Northern blot analysis during ES cell differentiation. These six ES clones represent four different genes. Among the six integration sites, one was at Zfp- 57 whose gene product {{is known to be}} enriched in undifferentiated ES cells. Three were located in an intron of a novel isoform of CSL/RBP-Jkappa which encodes the key transcription factor of the LIN- 12 /Notch pathway.

40|$|Summary The proteases of retroviruses, such as leukemia viruses, {{immunodeficiency}} viruses (including {{the human}} immunodeficiency virus, HIV), infectious anemia viruses, and mammary tumor viruses, form {{a family with}} the proteases encoded by several retrotransposons in Drosophila and yeast and endogenous viral sequences in primates. Retroviral proteases are key enzymes in viral propagation and are initially synthesized with other viral proteins as polyprotein precursors that are subsequently cleaved by the viral protease activity at specific sites to produce mature, functional units. Active retroviral proteases are homodimers, with each dimer structurally related to the larger class of singlechain aspartic peptidases.

This investigation was designed to determine whether transduced endothelial cells (ECs) could produce and post-translationally process somatostatin. Methods: Cultured canine venous, rat aortic, and rat microvascular ECs were transfected with retroviruses containing a human somatostatin cDNA or a control β-galactosidase gene. Total and isoform somatostatin production and uniformity of β-galactosidase expression were analyzed, as were the effects of somatostatin production on EC proliferation. Results: Somatostatin-transduced canine venous ECs, but not rat ECs, produced approximately 10 times as much total somatostatin as did control-transfected ECs (450 ± 32 vs 49 ± 10 pmol/L, p < 0. 05). The predominant isoform of somatostatin produced was somatostatin- 14. Production of somatostatin was stable with passage and did not impair the growth of canine ECs. The failure of rat ECs to produce somatostatin correlated with nonuniform expression of β-galactosidase, suggesting that promoter silencing was responsible for failure of transgene expression. Conclusion: <b>Retroviral</b> <b>gene</b> transfer of somatostatin to canine ECs results {{in the production of}} physiologically relevant concentrations of biologically active somatostatin.
