40|$|Subject {{of inquiry}} is double beta-processes, nuclear {{transitions}} into superdense state, cluster radioactivity, electron stability. The {{aim of the}} work is experimental detection or determination of liimting values for rare processes probability, theoretical analysis of the obtained data. New calculational algorithms and techniques realized in experiments simulator programmes using Monte Carlo method and in processing programmes for spectrometric data have been suggested. Limitations on nonconservation degree of lepton and electric charges, right-hand current impurities, masses of neutrino, photons and so on have been calculated. There were received experimental limitations for probabilities of 2 <b>K-captures</b> in 196 -Hg, various modes of 2 beta -decay of 116 -Cd, which are considered to be the most hard from all the known. For the first time there were determined limitations for probability of cluster decay of mercury various isotopes, and probability of titanium nuclei transition into superdense state. The designed programme parts of experiments simulation and experimental data processing is used in Institute for Nuclear Research of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukraine and in National Institute for Physics of Nucleus and Fundamental Particles (France). The programmes allow to simulate processes of electrons travel through any sibstance and double beta-decay, to computate the efficiency of recording of gamma-radiation from a solid specimen, to process one-dimensional spectra.

40|$|A toy model {{shows how}} {{neutrino}} masses and mixing can be investigated {{by studying the}} behavior of a radioactive ion which decays by <b>K-capture</b> BEFORE and DURING its weak decay by <b>K-capture.</b> A new oscillation phenomenon providing information about neutrino mixing is obtained by following the ion before and during the decay.
