40|$|The {{distribution}} of Vitis vinifera subsp. silvestris, the wild grapevine subspecies of Vitis vinifera L., has been dramatically reduced in its major sites of diffusion, at {{first by the}} spread, over the last 150 years, of pathogens from North America and, more recently, with fragmentation of habitat and <b>disbranching</b> by humans. In this work, 418 wild grapevine samples, belonging to 78 populations, were collected in their main Mediterranean distribution areas, including the Caucasus area, {{and the extent of}} their genetic variability evaluated by analysing plastid microsatellite DNA polymorphism. Results show low haplotype diversity value, with five haplotypes detected within the analysed populations. The highest within-population ha-plotypic diversity, with the presence of all five detected haplotypes, was found in the Caucasus regions and in the central regions of Italy. The {{distribution of}} all detected haplotypes suggests the Caucasian region as the possible center of origin of Vitis vinifera subsp. silvestris. A principal plastid lineage was found to be fixed in several locations, in the Northernmost European countries and in the Southern island of Sardinia. These results draw attention to two different refugium sites in the Mediterranean basin and suggest that conservation priority should be given to grapevine populations still preserved in hotspots of these regions...|$|E

40|$|EPIDEMIOLOGY (EPIDEMIOLOGIC RESEARCH) OF BURN INJURIES IN CHILDREN Lenka Eichlová Supervisor: MUDr. Monika Tokarik Background: Burn injury {{belongs to}} {{main cause of}} {{morbidity}} and mortality in children. More than 100 000 people sustain flash burn every year, 40 % of them forms children. Near minimus insider babies into two years come to scorch mostly owing second men. Cardinal cause of thermic injury off elderly is by personal endeavour. Burns differ by mechanism, range, depth and localization. An age is other crucial factor determinants prognosis of patient. And just therefore children's burns are very specific <b>disbranch</b> of medicine. Object: I tried to created a labour, in which I elaborate statistical data of newly hospitalized patiens on clinic of burns in FNKV behind the year 2008. Patients: The set contained 373 newly hospitalized patiens. I have divided them according to age, sex, mechanism of scorch, range, depths and localization of scorch. Further I followed longitude of hospitalization, way of applied therapy and occurence of complications. Results: Predomination of burns is in boyhood (65 %). The highest occurence of burns is in the group at the age of 0 - 2. The most frequent reason of burn in this group is caused by scalding hot liquid and further contact with hot body. In a group of 4 - 15 years old, [...] ...|$|R
