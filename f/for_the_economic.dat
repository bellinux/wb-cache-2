40|$|The article investigates <b>the</b> {{problem of}} <b>economic</b> {{security}} of <b>the</b> {{city in the}} strategic management system. The article describes the process of ensuring <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> security of <b>the</b> city. The organizational approach was approved using the example of Kharkiv city. The list of threats to <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> security of <b>the</b> city and their urgency is justified by combining such methods as expert surveys, SWOT-analysis and the hierarchy analysis method. There proposed a methodical approach to assessing <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> security of <b>the</b> city based on a hierarchically built system of indices (integral, complex and partial), which allowed determining <b>the</b> level of <b>economic</b> security of <b>the</b> city and imbalances {{in the development of}} its functional components. It is proposed to work out scenarios <b>for</b> ensuring <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> security of <b>the</b> city by combining the cognitive modeling and the scenario approach, which makes it possible to determine directions of the implementation of <b>the</b> strategy <b>for</b> ensuring <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> security of <b>the</b> city and choose leverages of state regulation.

5|$|During the Reagan years, Kemp and his {{followers}} ignored budget balancing while promoting tax cuts and economic growth.

Kemp notes that Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's success at stemming inflation and the favorable regulatory environment were also major factors. Detractors note that the expansion was fueled by undesirable sectors like gaming, prisons, medical treatment, and credit card use.|$|E

5|$|In the English towns the {{burgage tenure}} for urban {{properties}} was established {{early on in}} the medieval period, and was based primarily on tenants paying cash rents rather than providing labour services. Further development of a set of taxes that could be raised by the towns included murage for walls, pavage for streets, and pontage, a temporary tax for the repair of bridges. Combined with the lex mercatoria, which was a set of codes and customary practices governing trading, these provided a reasonable basis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> governance of the towns.|$|E
5|$|Articles 41–43 mandate the State to {{endeavour}} to secure to all citizens the right to work, a living wage, social security, maternity relief, and a decent standard of living. These provisions aim at establishing a socialist state as envisaged in the Preamble. Article 43 also places upon the State the responsibility of promoting cottage industries, {{and the federal government}} has, in furtherance of this, established several Boards for the promotion of khadi, handlooms etc., in coordination with the state governments. Article 39A requires the State to provide free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are available to all citizens irrespective of economic or other disabilities. Article 43A mandates the State to work towards securing the participation of workers in the management of industries. The State, under Article 46, is also mandated to promote the interests of and work <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> uplift of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and protect them from discrimination and exploitation. Several enactments, including two Constitutional amendments, have been passed to give effect to this provision.|$|E

Thereafter, he worked irregularly and attended political and religious meetings, trying to understand the reasons <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> turmoil of the Panic of 1893. In so doing, he became interested in anarchism. By 1901, this movement was feared in the United States—New York's highest court had ruled that the act of identifying oneself as an anarchist {{in front of an audience}} was a breach of the peace. Anarchists had taken a toll in Europe by assassinating or attempting assassinations of a half-dozen officials and members of royal houses, and had been blamed for the 1886 Haymarket bombing in Chicago.|$|E

5|$|The {{state and}} federal governments also had {{conflicts}} on the economic front. UMNO leaders feared that the economic dominance of Singapore would inevitably shift political power away from Kuala Lumpur. Despite earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore refused to provide Sabah and Sarawak {{the full extent of the}} loans previously agreed to <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> development of the two eastern states. The Bank of China branch of Singapore was closed by the Central Government in Kuala Lumpur as it was suspected of funding communists. The situation escalated to such an extent that talks between UMNO and the PAP broke down, and abusive speeches and writings became rife on both sides. UMNO extremists called for the arrest of Lee Kuan Yew.|$|E
5|$|Under Rau's {{leadership}} the DWK, {{still under}} {{supervision of the}} Soviet Military Administration in Germany (German: Sowjetische Militäradministration in Deutschland or SMAD), quickly developed more and more into a partner of the SMAD with its own conceptions and intentions.

One of Rau's aims during the meetings with the SMAD was, to come to agreements, which also obliged the Soviet side, including subordinate Soviet authorities, who still engaged in wild confiscations for reparation purposes. An important success in this direction was a half-year plan <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> development {{in the second half of}} 1948, which was accepted by the SMAD in May 1948.
