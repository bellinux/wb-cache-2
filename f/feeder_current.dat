For finding and forming a basic way to FFT analysis of <b>feeder</b> <b>current,</b> the paper embarks from the principle of Fourier transform and analyzes the principle and algorithm of the related metrics such as spectrum and signal-to-noise ratio(SNR). Then it uses the smooth function which is based on the moving average filter to filter the <b>feeder</b> <b>current,</b> which is used to prove the feasibility of this method. Meanwhile its result which we can get the data from figures and tables in the paper also shows that the smooth function as a low-pass filter can effectively filter out noise and keep the <b>feeder</b> <b>current</b> fundamental wave using the way that changes span values and method, but it will cause the base wave distortion.

Direct optimisation of the tap position is not appropriate since in general the high voltage (HV) side voltage is not known. Therefore, the tap setting can be determined give the optimal VCT once the HV side voltage is known. The objective function is composed of the distribution line loss cost, the peak power loss cost and capacitors' and VRs' capital, operation and maintenance costs. The constraints are limits on bus voltage and <b>feeder</b> <b>current</b> along with VR taps. The bus voltage should be maintained within the standard level and the <b>feeder</b> <b>current</b> should not exceed the feeder-rated current. The taps are to adjust the output voltage of VRs between 90 and 110 % of their input voltages. For validation of the proposed method, the 18 -bus IEEE system is used.

Wave {{and current}} {{measurements}} are presented from {{a set of}} laboratory experiments performed on a fixed barred beach with periodically spaced rip channels using a range of incident wave conditions. The data demonstrate {{that the presence of}} gaps in otherwise longshore uniform bars dominates the nearshore circulation system for the incident wave conditions considered. For example, nonzero cross-shore flow and the presence of longshore pressure gradients, both resulting from the presence of rip channels, are not restricted to the immediate vicinity of the channels but instead are found to span almost {{the entire length of the}} longshore bars. In addition, the combination of breaker type and location is the dominant driving mechanism of the nearshore flow, and both are found to be strongly influenced by the variable bathymetry and the presence of a strong rip current. The depth-averaged currents are calculated from the measured velocities assuming conservation of mass across the measurement grid. The terms in both the cross-shore and longshore momentum balances are calculated, and their relative magnitudes are quantified. The cross-shore balance is shown to be dominated by the cross-shore pressure and radiation stress gradients in general agreement with previous results, however, the rip current is shown to influence the wave breaking and the wave-induced setup in the rip channel. Analysis of the longshore balance shows that the overall strength of the longshore <b>feeder</b> <b>currents</b> is governed by a balance between longshore pressure gradient forcing and an opposing radiation stress gradient. In addition, the longshore <b>feeder</b> <b>currents</b> show maxima in the bar trough region, providing experimental evidence that longshore pressure gradients can shift longshore current maxima shoreward from the bar crest. Finally, since the longshore radiation stress gradient in the surf zone is governed by the amount of wave dissipation on the rip current, there exists a positive feedback mechanism whereby a strong rip current can weaken the radiation stress gradient opposing the <b>feeder</b> <b>currents</b> and lead to even stronger <b>feeder</b> <b>currents</b> and rips...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT – There is an {{increasing}} interest in renewable and green energy sources and the integration of Distributed Generation DG into the power grid system. The problem of optimal capacitor allocation in electric distribution systems involves maximizing energy utilization, feeder loss reduction, and power factor correction. The feeder loss can be separated into two parts based on the active and reactive power loss components. The paper presents a novel method for minimizing the loss associated with the reactive component of branch currents by placing shunt capacitor optimally selected banks. This paper presents a novel technique for capacitor sizing using the Multi objective multi-stage Particle Swarm Optimization MOPSO to determine optimal capacitor sizes in a radial distribution system.

Field data collected over 32 complete tidal cycles, spanning a range of wave and tide conditions, demonstrate that rip current strength and behaviour is modulated at the semi-diurnal frequency by tide-induced changes in the water-level over bar/rip morphology. Peak flow speeds in the rip neck 〈uv〉 correspond to the time of maximum wave breaking 1. 5 h before and after low water. Alongshore-directed water surface gradients ∂η/∂y were measured along the feeder channel and around the ends of the inter-tidal bar, with head differences O(0. 1 m). The numerical model reproduced ∂η/∂y with a good level of skill and showed that ∂η/∂y and 〈uv〉 increase with the proportion of breaking waves Qb over the inter-tidal bar; but 〈uv〉 was maximised during peak Qb, maximum ∂η/∂y occurred when wave breaking moved offshore to the sub-tidal bar and Qb was reduced. Around low water, the forcing of the rip current by the alongshore pressure-driven <b>feeder</b> <b>current</b> was reduced by the decrease in Qb over the bar and feeder regions, but an offshore flow through the rip channel was maintained by a localised intensification of ∂η/∂y around the ends of the inter-tidal bar...|$|E
40|$|Determination of the {{placement}} and rating of transformers and feeders {{are the main}} objective of the basic distribution network planning. The bus voltage and the <b>feeder</b> <b>current</b> are two constraints which should be maintained within their standard range. The distribution network planning is hardened when the planning area is located far from the sources of power generation and the infrastructure. This is mainly {{as a consequence of}} the voltage drop, line loss and system reliability. Long distance to supply loads causes a significant amount of voltage drop across the distribution lines. Capacitors and Voltage Regulators (VRs) can be installed to decrease the voltage drop. This long distance also increases the probability of occurrence of a failure. This high probability leads the network reliability to be low. Cross-Connections (CC) and Distributed Generators (DGs) are devices which can be employed for improving system reliability. Another main factor which should be considered in planning of distribution networks (in both rural and urban areas) is load growth. For supporting this factor, transformers and feeders are conventionally upgraded which applies a large cost. Installation of DGs and capacitors in a distribution network can alleviate this issue while the other benefits are gained. In this research, a comprehensive planning is presented for the distribution networks. Since the distribution network is composed of low and medium voltage networks, both are included in this procedure. However, the main focus of this research is on the medium voltage network planning. The main objective is to minimize the investment cost, the line loss, and the reliability indices for a study timeframe and to support load growth. The investment cost is related to the distribution network elements such as the transformers, feeders, capacitors, VRs, CCs, and DGs. The voltage drop and the <b>feeder</b> <b>current</b> as the constraints are maintained within their standard range. In addition to minimizing the reliability and line loss costs, the planned network should support a continual growth of loads, which is an essential concern in planning distribution networks. In this thesis, a novel segmentation-based strategy is proposed for including this factor. Using this strategy, the computation time is significantly reduced compared with the exhaustive search method as the accuracy is still acceptable. In addition to being applicable for considering the load growth, this strategy is appropriate for inclusion of practical load characteristic (dynamic), as demonstrated in this thesis. The allocation and sizing problem has a discrete nature with several local minima. This highlights the importance of selecting a proper optimization method. Modified discrete particle swarm optimization as a heuristic method is introduced in this research to solve this complex planning problem. Discrete nonlinear programming and genetic algorithm as an analytical and a heuristic method respectively are also applied to this problem to evaluate the proposed optimization method...|$|E
