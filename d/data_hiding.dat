Their design follows three requirements: 1) resistance to multi-snapshot adversaries; and 2) ensuring that <b>hidden</b> <b>data</b> {{will not be}} destroyed when a user is writing the public volume; and 3) using normal system operations on public data to disguise writes to <b>hidden</b> <b>data.</b> In ECD, the storage space is separated into two parts: a part containing the public data volume and the other containing the <b>hidden</b> <b>data</b> volume. The <b>hidden</b> volume is visible to the system when the user enters the secret key. ECD uses a large volume of pseudorandom <b>data</b> to <b>hide</b> the sensitive <b>data.</b> A portion of data from the volume are periodically migrated using normal firmware operations to obfuscate writes to the <b>hidden</b> <b>data.</b> Since <b>hidden</b> and pseudorandom <b>data</b> blocks are constantly relocated and modified, the <b>hidden</b> <b>data</b> may eventually be overwritten without knowing the secret key. To mitigate the overwrite issue, the rate of internal data migration {{is controlled by the}} user and the user should enter the secret key periodically.|$|R

This paper discusses and compares the two methodologies. Some similarities and differences are presented, in addition to discussing some of the best known algorithms for each. Lastly, an idea for a possible algorithm which combines the use of both steganography and visual cryptography is suggested. There are several ways of <b>hiding</b> <b>data</b> in files of different formats, leaving various signs of <b>hidden</b> <b>data.</b> Can <b>data</b> <b>hidden</b> in an original image be detected after it undergoes visual cryptography?

50|$|One of {{the more}} well known tools that is often used for <b>data</b> <b>hiding</b> is called Slacker (part of the Metasploit framework). Slacker breaks up a file and places each piece of that file into the slack space of other files, thereby hiding it from the {{forensic}} examination software. Another <b>data</b> <b>hiding</b> technique {{involves the use of}} bad sectors. To perform this technique, the user changes a particular sector from good to bad and then data is placed onto that particular cluster. The belief is that forensic examination tools will see these clusters as bad and continue on without any examination of their contents.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study steganalysis, the {{detection}} of <b>hidden</b> <b>data.</b> Specifically we focus on detecting <b>data</b> <b>hidden</b> in grayscale images with spread spectrum hiding.

To verify {{the results of these}} findings, we create a tool to discriminate between natural “cover ” images and “stego ” images (containing <b>hidden</b> <b>data)</b> taken from a diverse database. Existing steganalysis schemes that exploit the spatial memory found in natural images are particularly effective. Motivated by this, we include inter-pixel dependencies in our model of image pixel probabilities and use an appropriate statistical measure for the security of a steganography system subject to optimal hypothesis testing. Using this analysis as a guide, we design a tool for detecting hiding on various spread spectrum methods. Depending on the method and power of the hidden message, we correctly detect the presences of <b>hidden</b> <b>data</b> in about 95 % of images...|$|R
