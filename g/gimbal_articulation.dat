40|$|Performance of two {{solar sail}} {{attitude}} control implementations is evaluated. One implementation employs four articulated reflective vanes {{located at the}} periphery of the sail assembly to generate control torque about all three axes. A second attitude control configuration uses mass on a gimbaled boom to alter the center-of-mass location relative to the center-of-pressure producing roll and pitch torque along with a pair of articulated control vanes for yaw control. Command generation algorithms employ linearized dynamics with a feedback inversion loop to map desired vehicle attitude control torque into vane and/or <b>gimbal</b> <b>articulation</b> angle commands. We investigate the impact on actuator deflection angle behavior due to variations in how the Jacobian matrix is incorporated into the feedback inversion loop. Additionally, we compare how well each implementation tracks a commanded thrust profile, which has been generated to follow an orbit trajectory from the sun-earth L 1 point to a sub-L 1 station...|$|E
40|$|Three operational, {{engineering}} model, 7 -kW ion thrusters and one instrumented, dormant thruster {{were installed}} in a cluster array in a large vacuum facility at NASA Glenn Research Center. A series of engineering demonstration tests were performed to evaluate the system performance impacts of operating various multiple-thruster configurations in an array. A suite of diagnostics was installed to investigate multiple-thruster operation impact on thruster performance and life, thermal interactions, and alternative system modes and architectures. The ion beam characterization included measuring ion current density profiles and ion energy distribution with Faraday probes and retarding potential analyzers, respectively. This report focuses on the ion beam characterization during single thruster operation, multiple thruster operation, various neutralizer configurations, and thruster <b>gimbal</b> <b>articulation.</b> Comparison of beam profiles collected during single and multiple thruster operation demonstrated the utility of superimposing single engine beam profiles to predict multi-thruster beam profiles. High energy ions were detected in the region 45 off the thruster axis, independent of thruster power, number of operating thrusters, and facility background pressure, which indicated that the most probable ion energy was not effected by multiple-thruster operation. There were no significant changes to the beam profiles collected during alternate thruster-neutralizer configurations, therefore supporting the viability of alternative system configuration options. Articulation of one thruster shifted its beam profile, whereas the beam profile of a stationary thruster nearby did not change, indicating there were no beam interactions which {{was consistent with the}} behavior of a collisionless beam expansion...|$|E
