2500|$|While giving {{one piece}} of the flag to Ausmus, he held onto another piece until {{the time of his}} death. Gen. Wainwright later {{recalled}} the circumstances of Bunker's death in the prison camp, still holding onto the remnant: [...] "He must have suffered ... constant pain of hunger ... <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> him for a part of the last two hours of his life ... cremated in the rags in which he had carefully sewn a bit of the American flag he had pulled down in Corregidor." ...|$|E
2500|$|E. Urner Goodman {{also wrote}} the Owasippe Hymn {{that would become}} the Reservation's song that is sung {{at the end of}} all opening and closing campfires by the staff. The {{original}} lyrics written in 1927 by Dr. Goodman remain in the museum. According to a now older staff alumni, Joseph Sener, he stood with Sheridan Nunn at the shore of the current location of the Blackhawk Fire-bowl during Camp Blackhawk's relocation and Nunn said, [...] "it was here at this spot in 1927 that <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> E. Urner Goodman as he wrote out the lyrics to the Owasippe Hymn". Sener recounts how when he heard that he was smart enough to know how amazing and important that was.|$|E
2500|$|A {{considerable}} amount of material has been deleted by Blake in the manuscript. For example, when Tiriel initially arrives in the Vales of Har, he lies about his identity. In the poem as Blake left it, the scene reads [...] "I am not of this region, said Tiriel dissemblingly/I am an aged wanderer once father of a race/Far in the north" [...] (2:43-44). However, in the original manuscript, between these two lines is contained the line [...] "Fearing to tell them who he was, because of the weakness of Har." [...] Similarly, when Har recognises Tiriel he proclaims [...] "Bless thy face for thou are Tiriel" [...] (3:6), to which Tiriel responds [...] "Tiriel I never saw but once <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> him and ate" [...] (3:7). Between these two lines were originally the lines [...] "Tiriel could scarcely dissemble more & his tongue could scarce refrain/But still he fear'd that Har & Heva would die of joy and grief." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1861, the {{decorative}} arts firm Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., [...] "Fine Art Workmen in Painting, Carving, Furniture and the Metals," [...] was jointly created by William Morris, Madox Brown, Burne-Jones, Charles Faulkner, Rossetti, P. P. Marshall, and Philip Webb to create and sell medieval-inspired, handcrafted items for the home. Jane Morris directed the embroidery arm, and Georgiana was employed painting tiles, but {{with the birth of}} her son Philip in October of that year she gave up the art studio to become a full-time caregiver. [...] "I remember the feeling of exile with which I now heard through its closed door the well-known voices of friends together with Edward's familiar laugh, while <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> my little son on my knee and dropped selfish tears on him as 'separator of companions and the terminator of delights'". [...] As late as 1868 she was still attempting to learn to etch but none of her work was published.|$|E

60|$|One morning, a {{considerable}} time after my studies were completed, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> at breakfast <b>with</b> my mother.|$|R
60|$|For before I left England, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> Aunt Emma in {{her little}} drawing-room at Barton-on-the-Sea, {{discussing}} my plans and devising routes westward, she made me, quite suddenly, an unexpected confession.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> {{him in the}} smoking-room, propounding what I {{considered}} to be the most indisputable and non-contentious propositions conceivable--until, to my infinite amazement, he exploded and called me a [...] "damned young puppy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And we {{are making}} seven miles an hour," [...] I {{concluded}} for him, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> my eyes upon the distance meter. [...] "How thick is the Earth's crust, Perry?" [...] I asked.|$|E
60|$|At first <b>I</b> stormed. Vane <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> an amused smile {{upon his}} lips and listened.|$|R
60|$|This was {{owing to}} my vow to Philippa, that I would read every journal {{published}} in England. As the day went on, <b>I</b> often <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> {{them up to}} my shoulders, and littering all the patio.|$|R

60|$|They {{brought a}} quarter of a saddle to Colonel Clark, but he smiled at them kindly and told them to divide it amongst the weak. He looked at me as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> my feet crossed on the stump.|$|E

60|$|My fust {{idea was}} to go arter 'im, but I knew I couldn't catch 'im, and if I tried to meet 'im coming back I should most likely miss 'im through the side streets. So <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> there <b>with</b> my pipe and waited.|$|R
5000|$|Adams {{elaborated}} further, [...] "It's {{the second}} {{draft of the}} song that I wrote for Chris Feinstien. ... I think it was really fantastic, {{it was a good}} thing for me to write.

60|$|I must confess, too, that I {{remained}} there {{long after he}} had crawled under his mosquito-net. He had entreated me not to leave him; so, as one sits up with a nervous child, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> up <b>with</b> him--in the name of humanity--till he fell asleep.|$|R

60|$|That {{afternoon}} Reuben Camp came lounging {{up toward}} us, where <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> {{her on the}} corner of the piazza, and said that if she would like to let him try his luck with some tickets for the Talk he would see what he could do.|$|E
60|$|As for me, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> {{my heart}} beating within my breast {{as though it}} would burst asunder, for I saw that my fate was decided at last, {{and that one of}} the {{greatest}} happenings in all of my life was soon to come upon me.|$|E

60|$|It {{really did}} my heart good as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> my comrades beside our fire {{and looked around}} me on their happy faces, which were {{rendered}} still happier by the gift from us of a small quantity of tobacco, with which we had taken care to provide ourselves for this very purpose.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>with</b> my {{eyes fixed}} on him, and he never left the house without having me at his heels; and if it ever {{happened}} {{that when he was}} preparing to go out I was asleep, and did not notice, he would call [...] "Rufus, Rufus," [...] for that was the name he gave me.|$|E

5000|$|Don D'Amassa, in {{his review}} for Science Fiction Chronicle said [...] "I've enjoyed almost every book I've ever read by Foster, so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>with</b> this new one expecting an enjoyable read.

60|$|No {{one spoke}} again, and, drawing the two {{remaining}} blankets across the three, we sank into our couches of spruce twigs and slept soundly.
