5|$|General Motors' then-Vice-Chairman Robert Lutz {{said the}} {{two-seater}} sports car {{being developed by}} Tesla, the Tesla Roadster, and the rapid advancement of lithium-ion battery technology inspired him to push the carmaker to develop the Volt after the 2006 Detroit Auto Show, overcoming internal opposition. Lutz's initial idea was to develop an all-electric car, but Jon Lauckner, General Motors Vice President for Global Vehicle Development, convinced him that to avoid an expensive battery, range anxiety concerns, and lack of public charging infrastructure, they could use a smaller battery pack with a small <b>gasoline</b> <b>engine</b> driving a generator acting as a backup to extend the range, but without a mechanical connection between the <b>gasoline</b> <b>engine</b> and the drive wheels, {{so it would be}} a pure electrically driven vehicle without many of the limitations General Motors learned from the EV1 experience.|$|E
5|$|A plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (PHEV or PHV), also known as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid {{electric vehicle}} with rechargeable batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source. A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional {{hybrid electric vehicle}} and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a <b>gasoline</b> <b>engine</b> and an electric motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted.|$|E

It had a main armament of four 0.5in (12.7mm) machine guns in a M45 Quadmount and 12millimeters of armor on the front and the sides.|$|E
5|$|The Opel Monza Concept is a four-seat coupe plug-in hybrid {{concept car}} with {{gullwing}} door unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show. The concept shares {{the same basic}} plug-in hybrid setup as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera, but using a turbocharged 1 L 3-cylinder natural gas-powered engine as its range extender instead of General Motors’ current 1.4 L <b>gasoline</b> <b>engine.</b> According to Opel, this concept is the role-model {{for the next generation}} of Opel cars, and because of its modular chassis design, future cars based on it would be able to accommodate gasoline, diesel or electric power.|$|E

It was 20ft 2 in long, 6ft 5 in wide, 7ft 8 in high, with a weight of 9.54short tons. The suspension consisted of semi-elliptical longitudinal leaf springs for the wheels and vertical volute springs for the tracks. It was powered by a White 160AX, 147hp, 386 in3, six-cylinder <b>gasoline</b> <b>engine</b> with a compression ratio of 6.3:1. It was capable of a maximum road speed of 45mph.

50|$|Diesel {{engines are}} {{generally}} heavier, noisier, {{and more powerful}} at lower speeds than <b>gasoline</b> <b>engines.</b> They are also more fuel-efficient in most circumstances and are used in heavy road vehicles, some automobiles (increasingly so for their increased fuel efficiency over <b>gasoline</b> <b>engines),</b> ships, railway locomotives, and light aircraft. <b>Gasoline</b> <b>engines</b> are used in most other road vehicles including most cars, motorcycles, and mopeds. Note that in Europe, sophisticated diesel-engined cars have taken over about 45% of the market since the 1990s. There are also engines that run on hydrogen, methanol, ethanol, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), biodiesel, paraffin and tractor vaporizing oil (TVO).|$|R
5|$|The F1 {{project was}} {{completed}} in 1989, involving 60 designers, 24 engineering teams, 1,400 engineers, 2,300 technicians, 220 support workers, approximately 450 prototypes and more than $1 billion in costs. The resulting car, the Lexus LS 400, had a design that shared no major elements with previous Toyota vehicles, with a new 4.0 L V8 <b>gasoline</b> <b>engine</b> and rear-wheel drive. The car debuted in January 1989 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit and sales of the vehicle began the following September at a network of 81 new Lexus dealerships in the U.S. The LS 400 was sold along with the smaller ES 250, a rebadged version of the Japanese market Toyota Camry Prominent/Toyota Vista. The launch of Lexus {{was accompanied by a}} multimillion-dollar advertising campaign.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{ambulances}} {{are typically}} powered by internal combustion engines, {{which can be}} powered by any conventional fuel, including diesel, gasoline or liquefied petroleum gas, depending on the preference of the operator {{and the availability of}} different options. Colder regions often use gasoline-powered engines, as diesels can be difficult to start when they are cold. Warmer regions may favor diesel engines, as they are thought to be more efficient and more durable. Diesel power is sometimes chosen due to safety concerns, after a series of fires involving gasoline-powered ambulances during the 1980s. These fires were ultimately attributed in part to gasoline's higher volatility in comparison to diesel fuel. The type of engine may be determined by the manufacturer: in the past two decades, Ford would only sell vehicles for ambulance conversion if they are diesel-powered. Beginning in 2010, Ford will sell its ambulance chassis with a <b>gasoline</b> <b>engine</b> in order to meet emissions requirements.|$|E
5|$|The Porsche hull designs {{included}} a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension {{was the same}} as on the Elefant tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired bogies sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a Diesel-electric transmission, only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the prime mover), similar to a gasoline-electric hybrid but without a storage battery; two separate drive trains in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; <b>gasoline</b> <b>engine</b> – electric generator – electric motor – drive sprocket. This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the Tiger (P) (later Elefant prototypes) and in some US designs, but had never been put into production. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later Jagdtiger tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives. Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{a technological}} assessment of automotive powertrain technologies {{for the near}} to mid term future. The powertrain types to be assessed include naturally aspirated <b>gasoline</b> <b>engines,</b> turbocharged <b>gasoline</b> <b>engines,</b> diesel engines, electric hybrids using <b>gasoline</b> <b>engines</b> and advanced transmissions. Advancements in aerodynamics, weight reduction and tire rolling friction are also taken into account. The basis for the comparison is the potential of these powertrain technologies for reduction of oil consumption and green house gas emissions {{at the same level}} of performance as current vehicles. The fuel consumption and performance of future vehicles was estimated using simple scaling laws and vehicle simulations. The results indicate that the potential for reduction of fuel consumption is significant for all the powertrains examined. More specifically, it seems that the current relative advantage of diesel over <b>gasoline</b> <b>engines</b> in terms of fuel consumption is reduced. Future turbocharged <b>gasoline</b> <b>engines</b> especially, seem to become almost equivalent with diesel engines. (cont.) Hybrids electric vehicles do maintain a competitive advantage over other powertrains in terms of reduction of fuel consumption. This advantage is however much more pronounced for urban than for highway driving. by Emmanuel P. Kasseris. Thesis (S. M.)
