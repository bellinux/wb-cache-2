40|$|This paper proposes an {{explanation}} for observed differences in the business cycle volatility of employment and unemployment across a sample of OECD countries. Using an incomplete markets variant of the fair wage real business cycle model, increases in the <b>gross</b> <b>replacement</b> rate of public unemployment insurance are shown to increase the volatility of employment, and decrease the volatility of real wages, ceteris paribus. For a sample of 14 OECD countries over the period 1985 - 2005, the <b>gross</b> <b>replacement</b> rate {{is found to be}} positively correlated with the business cycle volatility of hours worked, lending support to the argument. A secondary contribution, which may be of some use in the incomplete markets literature, is the simple manner in which unemployment is endogenised in the model...|$|E
40|$|We analyse the {{development}} of labour productivity and hours worked by the working-aged population in the EU 25 countries and other OECD countries in 1960 - 2004. We emphasise the possible effects of taxes, benefits and other labour-market variables. First, we describe the trends in productivity and hours worked especially in the EU 15 countries relative to the United States. Then we use both cross-section analyses of the 1995 - 2004 period and pooled least squares panel data analyses of the 1960 - 2004 period to explain {{the development}}s. Taxes and <b>gross</b> <b>replacement</b> rates do not correlate with productivity growth. Instead, productivity growth is influenced positively by investment into fixed assets, R&D and ICT, higher levels of education, and lower product market regulation. According to the results, taxes and <b>gross</b> <b>replacement</b> rates do {{have a negative effect}} on the average number of hours worked. Also the ratio between collective bargaining coverage and trade union density as well as higher product market regulation seem to {{have a negative effect on}} the number of hours worked.

40|$|In France {{over the}} last fifteen years two {{important}} reforms in the basic pension systems (1993 and 2003) were made and numerous measures concerning the legal supplementary benefits systems were put into effect. Contrary to other countries, the role of the pay-as-you-go system as the main pension financing system has apparently continued. The early age at which a worker can claim a retirement benefit has remained unchanged. The core of the 2003 pension reforms strategy is the hopped reduction of unemployment in the next years, which will allow an increase of the employments' rate of older worker and thus an extension of the insurance period to get a full rate pension. In this context a limited increase of the pension contributions without a rise of the total social security contributions would be possible. Is there actually a French way to the pension reform ? After an overview of the legal pension system in France, which allow us to present the content of the most important pension reform of 1993, we analyse and discuss, in a second part, the explaining factors of the new reform, which was adopted in the year 2003. The third part of our contribution is dedicated to an evaluation of the reform strategy and the expected effects of this reform. We will show that the answer to our question must be strongly qualified, notably because of the very important reduction of <b>gross</b> <b>replacements</b> rates in the long term, which {{could be one of the}} sharpest in the EU.

40|$|The Dutch {{pension system}} is highly ranked on adequacy. These rankings, however, {{are based on}} fictitious {{replacement}} rates for median income earners. This paper investigates whether the Dutch pension adequacy is still high when we {{take into account the}} resources that people really accumulate, using a large administrative data set. A comprehensive approach is followed: not only public and private pension rights, but also private savings and housing wealth are taken into account. Summed over all age- and socioeconomic groups we find a median <b>gross</b> <b>replacement</b> rate of 83 % and a net replacement rate of 101 %. At retirement age, 31 % of all households face a <b>gross</b> <b>replacement</b> rate that is lower than 70 % of current income. Public and occupational pensions each account for more than 35 % of total pension annuities. Private non-housing assets account for 14 % and imputed rental income from net housing wealth accounts for about 10 %. Some vulnerable groups, such as the self-employed, have below average replacement rates. Results are fairly similar to results found in the UK, indicating that we should be careful in evaluating the adequacy of pensions systems on the basis of fictitious replacement rates...|$|E
40|$|Generous {{unemployment}} benefits {{lie at the}} heart of the conventional explanation for persistent high unemployment. The effects of benefit generosity are more ambiguous in a broader behavioral framework in which workers get substantial disutility from unemployment controlling for income, and know that unemployment has scarring effects in the future. The micro evidence suggests modest effects of changes in generosity, but there are reasons to doubt that the impacts on national unemployment rates are consequential. The strongest evidence for the orthodox prediction comes from cross-country regressions on the OECD’s <b>gross</b> <b>replacement</b> rate (GRR), but we find little support in the pattern of annual changes in the GRR and the unemployment rate for OECD countries over the last three decades. We take advantage of newly released and much improved net replacement rate indicators from the OECD, which show little correlation with either the GRRs or with unemployment and employment rates. The evidence does not offer compelling support for the view that benefit generosity is at the root of high European unemployment. ��...|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{research}} has shown {{that there has been a}} tendency of convergence of social protection levels in the European Union and in other OECD countries over the last decades. However, comparative studies of social protection systems frequently use indicators (gross public expenditure on social benefits and <b>gross</b> <b>replacement</b> rates) which may not be representative as measures of the level or generosity of benefits in different countries. In this paper we will do new convergence tests with more recent data (years). We will also use recent OECD data which take into account the effects of accounting for the impact of the tax system on social protection statistics and analyse whether and to what extent relative and/or absolute differences in social protection will become smaller with these adjustments. Our empirical analyses- using data for 2001 / 2003 - indicate that accounting for the impact of the tax system has an equalising effect on levels of social effort across countries (as measured by social expenditure ratios and replacement rates). Especially within the EU Member-countries differences in total net spending levels and differences in replacement rates become small...|$|E

By calculating Gini and Kakwani indices, we also estimate the inequality reduction and the progressivity characteristics of taxes on replacement incomes.

30|$|Given {{the design}} of the Spanish UIS, all {{employees}} who involuntarily become unemployed are entitled to Unemployment Benefits, provided that they have been employed for at least 12  months over the previous 72 -month period. Individuals who receive full-time disability benefits, people who leave their jobs voluntarily and anyone over the age of 64 are excluded from these benefits. Benefits end when individuals cease to be unemployed or reach the maximum entitlement period. During the analysed period, the amount of income provided to each unemployed individual is determined by multiplying the <b>gross</b> <b>replacement</b> rate by the individual’s average basic pay over the twelve months preceding unemployment. This replacement rate is 70  % of previous wages {{for the first six months}} and 60  % of previous wages from the seventh month onward. 6 The length of the benefit entitlement period depends on previous employment duration. Specifically, the initial benefit period is at least 4  months, which may be extended in 2 -month increments up to a maximum of 2  years, depending on the worker’s employment record. Finally, Unemployment Assistance benefits are available for people who have not been working long enough to qualify for the previously described unemployment benefits and for people who have exhausted them and have family responsibilities.|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} but {{difficult to distinguish}} between desirable and undesirable effects of unemployment insurance (UI) that are observationally equivalent when designing optimal UI schemes. For example, a UI-induced rise in the wage rate caused by workers taking more time to match their skills with job vacancies is desirable. However, another view of the same observation is that UI causes permanently higher involuntary unemployment by raising the reservation wage. This paper avoids this problem by regarding the trade-off between the UI replacement rates and unemployment as an intermediate relationship that matters {{only as far as}} it impacts economic growth. An empirical analysis of UI replacement rates, unemployment rates, and growth rates using annual panel data finds UI replacement rates are associated with higher unemployment. However, no significant relationship is found between UI-related unemployment and the real growth rate of gross domestic product.

40|$|The {{value of}} {{functional}} and biologically diverse landscapes to indigenous societies is increasingly recognised in public debates about development pathways but rarely rigorously assessed in development decisions. Using the replacement cost method, we quantify the direct consumptive value of aquatic species and sites for indigenous subsistence in three Australian tropical river catchments where negligible data exists on indigenous water {{values and the}} extensive use of wild resources for food, art, craft and medicines. The results establish a baseline for assessing and monitoring the socio-economic impact of hydrological and ecological changes from water resource development. More than 90 % of the <b>gross</b> <b>replacement</b> value in each catchment was accounted for by a small subset of high value species {{which could be used}} as integrated indicators of ecological and socio-economic change. The total value of species harvested was distributed across a large number of sites, justifying the need for a regional management approach to ensure the maintenance of diverse habitats for hunting and fishing. While 'value' is a cultural, context-dependent construct, studies like this one can lend legitimacy to a targeted approach to environmental and social impact assessment of water resource development proposals by calling for prioritisation of mitigation and management actions.

40|$|Flexicurity is at {{the heart}} of European policy debates. Its aim is to {{overcome}} the tensions between labour market flexibility on the one hand, and the provision of social security for workers on the other hand. To date, there is little insight into whether flexicurity policies have been adopted across the European Union. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyse to what extent labour market policies have been reformed along the lines of the flexicurity concept across 18 European countries over the period 1985 - 2008. Focusing on the main axes of the flexicurity concept, new datasets are used to examine changes in employment protection legislation, unemployment benefits and active labour market policies. Data on the strictness of employment regulation indicate that reforms have been influenced by labour market insiders, since the level of flexibility has been increased more for temporary employment, the labour market outsiders, than for regular employment, the insiders. Although <b>gross</b> unemployment <b>replacement</b> rates suggest that unemployment benefits have become more generous, net replacement rates indicate that the level of income security from benefits actually has been decreased. Moreover, data illustrate that larger shares of European labour forces have temporary contracts. As such, the gap between insiders and outsiders on the labour market has been increased. This development is contrary to the goals of the European Commission. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze the tax effects of various forms of remuneration, {{with a focus on}} {{employee}} benefits. The thesis is structured into three chapters. In the first chapter there is a definition of labor law relationship, it's participants, rewards and demands that are placed on them. An extensive part describes employee benefits, it's legislative regulation, classification and trends in this area. The second chapter describes taxation of income from employment and compulsory contributions to social and health insurance systems. There is also a description of tax and contribution liability of employee benefits. The third chapter attends to the description of employee benefits in ČSOB Pojišťovna, a. s. and analyses the impact of replacement these employee benefits with monetary income by employees with different level and structure of total <b>gross</b> income. This <b>replacement</b> reduces the total net income by all employees and the specific impact depends on the factors that affect the tax burden. It is influenced by various structural elements of tax or insurance and the rations of income to which they are applied (ie exemption or taxation) ...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{any differences}} between the percentages of involved breast volume, pathologic attributes, and tumor marker expression of T 3 and T 4 a-c tumors in locally advanced breast cancers (BC). METHODS: All patients with T 3 N > 0 and T 4 a-c BC without evidence of distant metastasis (M 0), presenting to the Breast Clinic from 1980 to 2010, were examined to determine whether their BC&#x 2019;s involved &#x 2265; 50 % of their breast volumes, defined by <b>gross</b> <b>replacement</b> {{of at least one}} hemisphere. Core needle biopsy or post-mastectomy specimens from tumors involving a known percent of breast volume were evaluated for: (1) pathological grades and lympho-vascular invasion (LVI); (2) hormone receptor (ER/PR) expression > 0; and (3) epidermoid growth factor 2 (her 2) over-expression (3 +) by immune-histochemical staining or fluorescent in situ hybridization. RESULTS: The data base included 98 patients with T 3 N> 0 M 0 and 120 with T 4 a-c, any N disease, M 0 disease. T 3 tumor masses involved 50 % or more of the breast in 23 / 98 (24 %), and T 4 a-c tumors 65 / 120 (54 %) (P < 0. 001). Only 1 % of T 3 tumors and 23 % of T 4 a-c tumors presented with total breast replacement. There were no significant {{differences between the}} pathological attributes and marker expression of the T 3 and T 4 a-c tumors.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of recent changes in second pension pillars of three Central and Eastern European Countries. The paper seeks to answer the {{following}} questions: i) what is the impact on the sustainability of Poland's pension system of the decrease in the pension contribution going to the second pension pillar from 7. 3 % to 2. 3 % in 2011; ii) {{what are the implications of}} the recent changes on <b>gross</b> <b>replacement</b> rates; iii) does the weakening of the Polish second pension system have a different impact on pension system sustainability than a similar move in a Hungarian-style pension system with a defined-benefit first pillar and iv) how does Estonia's temporary decrease in pension contributions compensated by temporarily higher future rates affect pension sustainability in that country. The simulation results show that in our baseline scenario the Polish move would permanently lower future pension-system debt, chiefly as a result of a cut in replacement rates. But using a combination of pessimistic assumptions including strong population ageing, low real wage growth and a high indexation of existing pension benefits, coupled with bringing in tax expenditures related to the third voluntary pension pillar and an increase in the share of minimum pensions leads to higher pension system deficits and eventually more public debt at a very long horizon. The simulations also suggest that the Hungarian pension reversal reduces deficit and debt only temporarily, mainly because of Hungary's costly defined-benefit first pension pillar: the weakening of the second pillar is tantamount to swapping low current replacement rates (in the defined-contribution second pillar) against high future replacement rates in the defined-benefit first pension pillar. Finally, results show that the Estonian move will increase public debt only very moderately in the long run, even though this result is sensitive to the effective interest rate on public debt...|$|E
30|$|Moreover, the {{structure}} of national labour markets (STRUC) is considered since it can influence structural changes and the speed of adjustment to shocks. To take these differences into account, the concentration of the population on a particular skill level (measured by {{the share of the}} population with tertiary education) was included to account for an increase in policy effectiveness when populations are highly educated since highly educated individuals have more probabilities to find a job. In addition, four controls for differences in institutional arrangements (INST) were also included in the estimation: union density, to control for insider power in wage bargaining, which may push wages upwards at a cost of lower employment, especially for groups whose labour supply is more elastic (e.g. low-skilled workers) (Layard et al. 2009); the two indexes of strictness of EPL, one for the layoff of temporary workers, since temporary layoff regulation can reduce search effectiveness of the unemployed (Bellmann and Jackman 1996 b), and another for the individual and collective dismissal of regular workers, as ALMP effectiveness can also be affected by the coexistence of different levels of EPL stringency between temporary and regular contracts (Dolado et al. 2002); and an average of <b>gross</b> <b>replacement</b> rates across various earnings levels, family situations and durations of unemployment to reflect the generosity of the unemployment benefit system and account for its interaction with ALMPs (Bassanini and Duval 2006; Martin and Grubb 2001). Finally, EU countries have a relatively integrated labour market due to a relative freedom in the movement of workers. To control for this special feature of the European labour market, a dummy variable was added taking the value of 1 for countries that are members of the European Union (EU). The variables used in the analysis draw from different sources of information. The exact definitions and sources can be found in Additional file  1 : Table S 1.14 Furthermore, a summary of descriptive statistics of the variables used in the analysis are also presented in Additional file  1 : Table S 4.|$|E
30|$|Focusing {{here on the}} authors’ panel {{regression}} analysis, Jaumotte and Osorio-Buitron first regress {{two measures}} of gross income inequality (namely the top 10  % income share and the Gini coefficient of gross income) on labor market institutions. The controls in addition to country and time fixed effects comprise technology, globalization, an index of financial reform, the top marginal tax rate, and a banking crisis variable. The labor market institutions are union density, excess collective bargaining coverage (viz. coverage less density), {{the value of the}} minimum wage in relation to the median wage, the first-year <b>gross</b> unemployment benefit <b>replacement</b> rate, and a measure of the employment protection afforded regular and temporary employment contracts. A separate regression analysis of the Gini coefficient of net income inequality is also provided in which a key RHS variable is the Gini coefficient of gross income, the other arguments being a subset of those considered earlier. In each case, a benchmark equation is run containing all the controls plus union density (and the minimum wage). Next, the estimating equation is augmented by an excess collective bargaining coverage variable. Finally, the rest of the labor market arguments are added (and excess collective bargaining coverage dropped).|$|R

40|$|This {{second edition}} of Pensions at a Glance updates all the {{important}} indicators of retirement-income systems developed for the first edition. The values of all pension system parameters reflect {{the situation in the}} year 2004. The general approach adopted is a “microeconomic” one, looking at prospective individual entitlements under all 30 of OECD member countries’ pension regimes. The report starts by showing the different schemes that together make up national retirement income provision, including a summary of the parameters and rules of pension systems. This is followed by eight main indicators of pension income that are calculated using the OECD pension models. This issue also contains two special analyses on pension reforms and private pensions, which use the OECD pension models to explore more deeply the central issues of pension policy in national debates. Finally, the report provides detailed background information on each of the 30 countries’ retirement-income arrangements. For workers at average earnings, the average for the OECD countries of the <b>gross</b> <b>replacement</b> rate, i. e. the ratio between pension benefit and pre-retirement earnings, from mandatory pensions is 58. 7 %. But taxes {{play an important role in}} old-age support. Pensioners often do not pay social security contributions and, as personal income taxes are progressive and pension entitlements are usually lower than earnings before retirement, they usually pay less taxes. For average earners, the net replacement rate across OECD countries is nearly 70 % on average, some 11 percentage points higher than the average <b>gross</b> <b>replacement</b> rate. For low earners, the average net replacement rate across OECD countries is 83 %. But there are regional differences: the Nordic countries offer a 95 % net replacement rate to workers on half average earnings while the Anglophone OECD countries pay 76 % of previous net earnings. What matters for governments, however, is not only the replacement rate but the value of the overall pension promise. This is measured by the indicator of pension wealth which takes life expectancy and the indexation of pensions in payment into account. Using this indicator, the pension promise is most expensive in Luxembourg. On average, each male pensioner will receive the equivalent of USD 920 000 and each female retiree over USD 1 million. The Netherlands and Greece rank second and third on this measure. The most modest pension systems are those of Belgium, Ireland, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States where pension wealth is around two-thirds of the average for OECD countries. The lowest ranking is occupied by Mexico where men and women are promised a pension equivalent to USD 34 000 and 32 000, respectively. Nearly all the 30 OECD countries have made at least some changes to their pension systems since 1990. As a result, the average pension promise in the 16 countries - whose reforms are studied in this report - was cut by 22 %. For women, the reduction was 25 %. Only in two of the 16 countries – Hungary and the United Kingdom – were there increased pension promises on average. How will these changes affect different individuals? Some countries – such as France, Portugal and the United Kingdom – are moving towards greater targeting of public pensions on low earners thus bolstering the safety-net. Others – such as Poland and the Slovak Republic – have moved to tighten the link between pension entitlements and earnings, which may put low-earners at a higher risk of poverty. In Germany, Japan, Mexico, Poland and the Slovak Republic, for example, the net pension entitlement for a full-career worker with half average earnings was around 41 % of average earnings before reform, slightly below the average for the OECD as a whole. The reforms will cut this to just 32. 5 %. In contrast, Finland, France, Hungary, Korea, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have protected low-income workers from cuts in benefit in their pension reforms. The intense reform activity in OECD countries means that today’s workers will have to do more on their own to prepare for tomorrow’s retirement. In some countries, the savings effort necessary to reach the OECD average replacement rate is substantial, even if workers save throughout their entire career. If young workers miss out on the first 10 or 15 years of their career because of other demands on their budget, reaching a sufficient pension level will become even more difficult. This report illustrates how important it is that workers start saving early and contribute regularly. ...|$|E
