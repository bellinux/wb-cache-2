40|$|Background Recently, {{there has}} been a growing {{awareness}} {{of the importance of the}} roles of <b>fathers</b> <b>in</b> understanding normative developmental processes. Increased attention has been given to the roles of <b>fathers</b> <b>in</b> the area of clinical child research and therapy. However, the presence of <b>fathers</b> <b>in</b> research and treatment in pediatric psychology has not been fully examined. Objective To explore the status of including <b>fathers</b> <b>in</b> both research and treatment in the area of pediatric psychology. Method An extensive review of published research. Results The findings suggest that pediatric psychology research lags even farther behind clinical child research <b>in</b> including <b>fathers</b> <b>in</b> research designs and analyzing for maternal and paternal effects separately. There is also a concomitant lack of inclusion of <b>fathers</b> <b>in</b> family-based interventions in pediatric psychology. Conclusion These patterns are discussed, with an emphasis on strategies to increase the inclusion of <b>fathers</b> <b>in</b> research and treatment of pediatric psychology issues. Future directions for researchers and clinicians are also included. Key words fathers; mothers; family research; treatment. Historically, fathers have not been included in research on normative developmental processes or in research and treatment of developmental psychopathology. Since the mid- 1960 s, this pattern has improved for research on normative developmental processes with somewhat greater attention to the roles of <b>fathers</b> <b>in</b> children’...|$|R

40|$|Objective: There {{is limited}} {{research}} on <b>fathers</b> <b>in</b> {{the setting of}} maternal teenage pregnancy. Most studies report data from regions of social disadvantage and low education. We report on the levels of anxiety, depression {{and quality of life}} of <b>fathers</b> <b>in</b> the setting of maternal teenage pregnancy in an area where the unemployment rate is low. Methods: Observational study of 50 <b>fathers</b> <b>in</b> the setting of maternal teenage pregnancy and 100 fathers whose partners were not teenagers (control), living within the same metropolitan healthcare region with high employment rates. Fathers were enrolled within the larger Australian Father’s Study and were recruited from antenatal clinics and community settings. Researchers administered the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale and demographic questionnaires. Results: <b>Fathers</b> <b>in</b> the setting of maternal teenage pregnancy were significantly younger than control fathers (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). After adjusting for demographic variables, <b>fathers</b> <b>in</b> the setting of maternal teenage pregnancy did not have levels of anxiety, depression or quality of life that were significantly different to control <b>fathers.</b> Conclusion: <b>Fathers</b> <b>in</b> the setting of maternal teenage pregnancy, when engaged in further education or employment have levels of anxiety, depression and quality of life comparable to control fathers...|$|R
