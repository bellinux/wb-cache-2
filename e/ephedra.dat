The Hsanda Gol Formation of Mongolia represents an arid desert basin, and the environment is thought to have had few tall trees and limited brush cover, as the fauna consisted mainly of animals that fed from tree tops or close to the ground. A study of fossil pollen showed that much of China was woody shrubland, with plants such as saltbush, mormon tea (<b>Ephedra),</b> and nitre bush (Nitraria), all adapted to arid environments. Trees were rare, and concentrated near groundwater. The parts of China where Paraceratherium lived had dry lakes and abundant sand dunes, and the most common plant fossils are leaves of the desert-adapted Palibinia. Trees in Mongolia and China included birch, elm, oaks, and other deciduous trees, while Siberia and Kazakhstan also had walnut trees.

The effects of single admin ist er ed BOF and composed crude drugs in 6 groups were investigated on the levels of diabetic parameters (serum glu cose, insulin, triglyceride and cholesterol) in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. The anti-hyperglycemic action of BOF was depended on <b>Ephedrae</b> Herba, Saposhnikoviae Radix and Schizonepetae Spica in diaphoretic group, For sythiae Fructus, Saposhnikoviae Radix, Schizonepetae Spica and Cnidii Rhizoma in antidote group, Scutellariae Radix, Gardeniae Fructus and Gypsum Fibrosum in antipyretic group and Paeoniae Radix in neutralizer group. In these crude drugs, <b>Ephedrae</b> Herba, Saposhnikoviae Radix, Schizonepetae Spica, Forsythiae Fructus, Scutellariae Radix, Gypsum Fibrosum and Paeoniae Radix increased serum insulin level, but Cnidii Rhizoma and Gardeniae Fructus did not affect serum insulin level. From these results, it suggested that anti-hyperglycemi c action of BOF was through insulin-de pendent and insulin independent manners. The lowering effect of BOF on serum triglyceride level was dependent on actions of Platycodi Radix in antidote and diuretic groups and Gardeniae Fructus in antipyretic group. The lowering effect of Gardeniae Fructus was parallel with its anti-hyperglycemic action. The lowering effect of BOF on high serum triglyceride level also included both direct action and indirect action. The reducing effect of BOF on serum cholesterol level was observed together with the actions of <b>Ephedrae</b> Herba and Zingiberis Rhizoma in diaphoretic group, Schi zonepetae Spica in diaphoretic and antidote groups and Paeoniae Radix in neutralizer group. The lowering effects of <b>Ephedrae</b> Herba, Schizonepetae Spica and Paeoniae Radix on serum cholesterol level were parallel with their anti-hy perglycemic actions. Zingiberis Rhizoma in diaphoretic group might be direct reducing effect on serum cholesterol level but no serum glucose level. The <b>Ephedrae</b> Herba in diaphoretic group, Schizonepetae Spica in diaphoretic and antidote groups and Paeoniae Radix in neutralizer group might have reduced serum cholesterol level by reducing blood glucose level.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the elimination of urinary ephedrines after administering Kakkon-to and to determine the possibility of urinary positive ephedrine test results. Six healthy volunteers took one single dose of 2. 5 g Kakkon-to extract granules. The concentrations of urinary ephedrines were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The result showed that ephedrine and norpseudoephedrine were excreted in the urine after taking one single dose of Kakkon-to. However, the highest amount of ephedrines in urine was ephedrine and the peak concentration was 4. 35 ± 1. 82 µg/mL (mean ± standard deviation), which was lower than the WADA permitted value (10 µg/mL).

The EtOAc fraction of SAD showed a significant effect on PPARγ activation. A simple and rapid method has been established for separation and characterization of the main compounds in the PPARγ-activating fraction of SAD by ultra-fast HPLC coupled with quadropole time-of-flight mass pectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS). A total of 10 compounds were identified in the activating fraction of SAD, including amygdalin (1), liquiritin (2), 6 ′-acetyliquiritin (3), liquiritigenin (4), isoliquiritigenin (5), formononetin (6), licoisoflavanone (7), glycycoumarin (8), glycyrol (9) and uercetin (10).

40|$|Annually, tens of {{millions}} of first-ever strokes occur in the world; however, currently there is lack of effective and widely applicable pharmacological treatments for stroke patients. Herbal medicines, characterized as multi-constituent, multi-target and multi-effect, have been acknowledged with conspicuous effects in treating stroke, and attract extensive interest of researchers although the mechanism of action is yet unclear. In this work, we introduce an innovative systems-pharmacology method that combines pharmacokinetic prescreening, target fishing and network analysis to decipher the mechanisms of action of 10 herbal medicines like Salvia miltiorrhizae, Ginkgo biloba and <b>Ephedrae</b> herba which are efficient in stroke treatment and prevention. Our systematic analysis results display that, in these anti-stroke herbal medicines, 168 out of 1285 constituents with the favorable pharmacokinetic profiles might be implicated in stroke therapy, and the systematic use of these compounds probably acts through multiple mechanisms to synergistically benefit patients with stroke, which can roughly be classified as preventing ischemic inflammatory response, scavenging free radicals and inhibiting neuronal apoptosis against ischemic cerebral damage, as well as exhibiting lipid-lowering, anti-diabetic, anti-thrombotic and antiplatelet effects to decrease recurrent strokes. Relying on systems biology-based analysis, we speculate that herbal medicines, being characterized as the classical combination therapies, might be not only engaged in multiple mechanisms of action to synergistically improve the stroke outcomes, but also might be participated in reducing the ris...|$|R

The doses of Gancao used in Shanghan Lun ranged from six zhu (Chinese unit, and one zhu is equal to 0. 65 g) to four liang (Chinese unit, and one liang is equal to 15. 625 g). Doses of one, two, three or four liang were commonly used. One liang Gancao as juvantia was usually matched with Mahuang (Herba <b>Ephedrae),</b> Xingren (Semen Armeniacae) and Guizhi (Ramulus Cinnamomi) for restricting the excessive diaphoresis of Mahuang. Two liang Gancao was often matched with some couple drugs, such as Guizhi and Shaoyao (Radix Paeoniae), Shigao (Gypsum Fibrosum) and Zhimu (Rhizoma Anemarrhenae), Fuzi (Radix Aconiti Lateralis) and Ganjiang (Rhizoma Zingiberis), for warming yang to supplement qi, nourishing yin, detoxifying Fuzi, and preventing qi impairment from heat evil.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{review the}} herbal drugs used most often for {{treating}} lung-distension by determining {{those used by}} physicians throughout history; to study their property, taste, and channel tropism; and to explore their compatibility. MethodsHistorical prescriptions for treating lung-distension were collected and sorted. Property, taste and channel tropism were determined, and the law of herbal administration was determined by cluster analysis. ResultsOne hundred and ninety five prescriptions were found, involving 166 herbal drugs, with a total appearance frequency of 1296 drugs. The herbs involved 8 properties (total appearance frequency, 1296), 7 forms of taste (total appearance frequency, 1991) and involved all 12 regular channels (total appearance frequency, 3382). Sixteen herbal drugs were used most often and formed 4 cluster prescriptions: C 1 : Xing Ren (Semen Armeniacae Amarum), Gan Cao (Radix Glycyrrhizae), and Ban Xia (Rhizoma Pinelliae); C 2 : Gui Zhi (Ramulus Cinnamomi), Wu Wei Zi (Fructus Schisandrae), and Sheng Jiang (Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens); C 3 : Da Zao (Fructus Jujubae), Ma Huang (Herba <b>Ephedrae),</b> and Shi Gao (Gypsum Fibrosum); and C 4 : Chen Pi (Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae), Jie Geng (Radix Platycodi), Fu Ling (Poria), Sang Bai Pi (Cortex Mori), Xi Xin (Herba Asari), Gan Jiang (Rhizoma Zingiberis), and Bai Shao (Radix Paeoniae Alba).

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The western Nearctic {{species of}} the genus Phytocoris Fallen were taxonomically revised. Over 15, 000 {{specimens}} were examined. Information concerning host plant associations and distributions was compiled and summarized for use by future researchers. External morphological features and characters of the male genitalia were used to distinguish species. The genital tubercles above the clasper bases, claspers, and sclerotized process of the vesica were especially useful in this effort. These structures have been illustrated {{for each of the}} included species. One-hundred and sixty-two species of Phytocoris are now recognized from western North America. These have been arranged into 20 species-groups ranging in size from two to twenty-two species. The formation of species-groups was based primarily on characters of the male genitalia. Relationships between groups were cladistically analyzed. Forty-four characters of the male genitalia and external morphology were used to determine the final arrangement of species-groups. Forty-six new species are described, and the following synonymies are proposed (senior synonym first) : acaciae Knight = minuendus Knight; calli Knight = laticeps Knight; deserticola Knight lineatellus Knight; empirensis Knight = rinconae Knight; fraterculus Van Duzee = westwoodi Bliven; fuscipennis Knight = longirostris Knight; geniculatus Van Duzee = blackwelli Bliven; interspersus Uhler = eurekae Bliven; juniperanus Knight = chiricahuae Knight, flaviatus Knight, santaritae Knight; ketinelbi Bliven = kahtahbi Bliven; knowltoni Knight = albertae Knight, elongatus Knight; maritimus Van Duzee = sequoiae Bliven; neglectus Knight = yuroki Bliven; nigrifrons Van Duzee = abiesi.

A geographically diverse and high density taxon sampling strategy was employed, including multiple isolates/species from the following genera: Anteaglonium (6 / 4), Encephalographa (1 / 1), Farlowiella (3 / 1), Gloniopsis (8 / 4), Glonium (4 / 2), Hysterium (12 / 5), Hysterobrevium (14 / 3), Hysterographium (2 / 1), Hysteropatella (2 / 2), Lophium (4 / 2), Mytilinidion (13 / 10), Oedohysterium (5 / 3), Ostreichnion (2 / 2), Patellaria (1 / 1), Psiloglonium (11 / 3), Quasiconcha (1 / 1), Rhytidhysteron (8 / 3), and 24 outgroup taxa. Sequence data indicate that although the Hysteriales {{are closely related to}} the Pleosporales, sufficient branch support exists for their separation into separate orders within the Pleosporomycetidae. The Mytilinidiales are more distantly related within the subclass and show a close association with the Gloniaceae. Although there are examples of concordance between morphological and molecular data, these are few. Molecular data instead support the premise {{of a large number of}} convergent evolutionary lineages, which do not correspond to previously held assumptions of synapomorphy relating to spore morphology. Thus, within the Hysteriaceae, the genera Gloniopsis, Glonium, Hysterium and Hysterographium are highly polyphyletic. This necessitated the transfer of two species of Hysterium to Oedohysterium gen. nov. (Od. insidens comb. nov. and Od. sinense comb. nov.), the description of a new species, Hysterium barrianum sp. nov., and the transfer of two species of Gloniopsis to Hysterobrevium gen. nov. (Hb. smilacis comb. nov. and Hb. constrictum comb. nov.). While Hysterographium, with the type Hg. fraxini, is removed from the Hysteriaceae, some of its species remain within the family, transferred here to Oedohysterium (Od. pulchrum comb. nov.), Hysterobrevium (Hb. mori comb. nov.) and Gloniopsis (Gp. subrugosa comb. nov.); the latter genus, in addition to the type, Gp. praelonga, with two new species, Gp. arciformis sp. nov. and Gp. kenyensis sp. nov. The genus Glonium is now divided into Anteaglonium (Pleosporales), Glonium (Gloniaceae), and Psiloglonium (Hysteriaceae). The hysterothecium has evolved convergently no less than five times within the Pleosporomycetidae (e. g., Anteaglonium, Farlowiella, Glonium, Hysterographium and the Hysteriaceae). Similarly, thin-walled mytilinidioid (e. g., Ostreichnion) and patellarioid (e. g., Rhytidhysteron) genera, previously in the Mytilinidiaceae and Patellariaceae, respectively, transferred here to the Hysteriaceae, have also evolved at least twice within the subclass. As such, character states traditionally considered to represent synapomorphies among these fungi, whether they relate to spore septation or the ascomata, in fact, represent symplesiomorphies, and most likely have arisen multiple times through convergent evolutionary processes in response to common selective pressures.
