40|$|Amending the <b>funding</b> <b>arrangements</b> for {{maintained}} schools in England and Wales was among New Labour's educational priorities {{when it came}} to power in 1997.

5000|$|A {{review of}} {{available}} {{research on the}} Swedish model that partially inspired the policy was published in a paper by Rebecca Allen. It concluded, [...] "The econometric evidence {{on the effect of}} the reforms suggests that, so far, Swedish pupils {{do not appear to be}} harmed by the competition from private schools, but the new schools have not yet transformed educational attainment in Sweden." [...] Peter Wilby, writing in The Guardian, predicted that free schools would be run by private companies rather than parents, teachers or voluntary groups. The New Schools Network was subsequently set up to help groups develop the skills needed to set up free schools. Paul Carter, a Conservative councillor, pointed out that under the <b>funding</b> <b>arrangements</b> in place at the time, [...] "the more academies and Free Schools you operate, under the current academy <b>funding</b> <b>arrangements,</b> the less money maintained schools would get." [...] Subsequently, the Department for Education changed the <b>funding</b> <b>arrangements</b> for all maintained schools so that [...] "schools in similar circumstances and with similar intakes receive similar levels of funding", whatever type of school they are.|$|R
