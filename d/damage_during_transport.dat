40|$|A {{qualitative}} {{literature review}} on the preservation benefits of cold storage showed that when preserving paper the lifetime is doubled for each 5 ° C drop in temperature. By halving the relative humidity {{in the environment}} one can {{more than double the}} lifetime of the paper. To investigate the changes in temperature and relative humidity during transport in and out from cold storage several experiments where conducted. The experiments where carried out at The Royal Library in Denmark’s cold storage at Njalsgade 112. During the transport in and out from The Royal Library’s cold storage the changes in temperature and relative humidity where measured near the surface of the hollow test book and inside the book and inside a book placed in a stack of books. Based on the literature study and results from the experiments the following precautions, for transporting paper in and out of cold storages, to prevent condensation were taken: It is recommended that paper is stored in cold storages at temperatures down to 2 ° C, which exploits the low temperatures during winter, and about 45 % RH. During transport out from the cold storage paper should be packed in an impenetrable packaging or acclimatized in a climatecontrolled room. During transport back to the cold storage it is recommended that paper be acclimatized in a climate-controlled room and not under any circumstances packed in an impenetrable packaging. A single book should be acclimatized for three hours in order to avoid condensation on the surface as well as inside and the books should be stacked separately during acclimatization in the climate-controlled room. It is also recommended that the Library prolong delivery time so that the necessary time is available to avoid condensation <b>damage</b> <b>during</b> <b>transport</b> in and out from the cold storage and that the books are digitized for expanding public access to the material and to limit the damage caused by physical handling of the objects and the risk of <b>damage</b> <b>during</b> <b>transport</b> in and out of cold storage...|$|E

40|$|Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) {{were used}} for the {{instrumentation}} of the iron flux return of the BABAR detector as a muon system. Unfortunately the efficiency of the original RPCs degraded rapidly with time. Limited Streamer Tubes (LSTs) were chosen for an upgrade of the barrel portion of the detector. The phased installation started in summer 2004 with replacing two sextants of the BABAR barrel muon system with LSTs. The modules for the remaining four sextants are under long-term test at SLAC and ready for installation, expected in 2006. The modules become inaccessible once installed in BABAR, so it is critical to select only perfectly working tubes. To accomplish this a strong QC system was established during the prototype phase, and fully implemented throughout pre-production and construction. To spot any <b>damage</b> <b>during</b> <b>transport,</b> the final modules are subjected to comprehensive tests at SLAC immediately after arrival and kept under long-term test till installation into BABAR. Details of these tests and results from long-term testing will be discussed. Since spring 2005 the PEP-II accelerator is running and BABAR is collecting data.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{detailed}} case study of postharvest losses along a commercial small holder tomato supply chain in Fiji. It is the first systematic quantification of postharvest horticultural losses undertaken in Fiji. Postharvest loss was measured from harvest through to product arrival at the Suva municipal fruit and vegetable markets, with post-municipal market loss determined using simulated storage conditions. In this study, 32. 9 % of the harvested product {{was removed from the}} commercial supply chain due to rots (8. 8 %), failure to ripen (8. 9 %), insufficient volume fill a carton (7. 8 %), physical <b>damage</b> <b>during</b> <b>transport</b> (0. 1 %) and fruit being over-ripe (6. 4 %). Poor temperature management during on-farm product ripening and limited on-farm postharvest hygiene were key contributors to the observed loss. In trace-back studies to identify the end-use of all product removed from the commercial chain, of the 32. 9 % total commercial postharvest loss, 11. 0 % was consumed at home and/or traded within the village, 6. 3 % was fed to domestic livestock, and a further 14. 7 % ended up as on-farm waste or dumped at the municipal refuge. Based on simulated ambient storage condition, once the fruit arrived at the municipal markets, daily postharvest loss thereafter was between 8. 3 % and 13. 4 %. Overall accumulative postharvest losses based on three days post-market ambient storage was 60. 8 %. Postharvest ripening, storage and transport conditions along the supply chain are discussed...|$|E

Proper {{technical}} drying is {{a condition}} for processing sawn timber into high quality products. The drying process is a phase with an extreme importance in wood transformation process, because it gives a significant improvement to the characteristics of workability, prevents <b>damage</b> <b>during</b> <b>transport</b> and insects or fungi attack (Tsoumis, 1991; Walker, 1993). One {{of the most critical}} and important phases in the kiln dry is the perfect knowledge of moisture evolution in wood that is drying and is given by the probes measures. Therefore, it became necessary estimate frequently the wood moisture content, which should be at the same time accurate and practical. The objective of the present study is to verify the fiability of the data given by different probes types, and between the values given by this and the ones obtains by laboratory. This work was done in 2 different industrial dryers and in a laboratory dryer. There were executed several simple regression analysis to evaluated the existent relation between this ones and the ones obtain in laboratory; it was observed that to values until 30 % of moisture it exist a strong correlation between this two parameters but the same it wasn’t observed to higher moisture contents. It was made the confrontation between the result obtain in Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) and Eucalyptus (Eucaliptus globulus), and it was observed that the probes can evaluated the moisture content with higher accuracy in pine comparing with eucalyptus. So, it is necessary have some caution when the probes are disconnected, during the kiln dry process, specially to moisture content values are higher then 30 %, because the values given by them are some times liable to error...|$|E
50|$|From a legal standpoint, {{multimodal}} transport creates several problems. Unimodal transports are currently governed by different, often-mandatory international conventions.

40|$|Western Research Institute (WRI) of Laramie, Wyoming and AeRock, LLC of Eagar, Arizona (formerly of Bellevue, Washington) partnered, under {{sponsorship}} of the U. S. Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory (U. S. DOE-NETL), to support the development of rapid-setting, ash-based, fiber-incorporated ''green'' building products. Green building materials are a rapidly growing trend in the building and construction industry in the US. A two phase project was implemented wherein Phase I assessed, through chemical and physical testing, ash, ash-based cement and fiber composites exhibiting superior structural performance when applied to the AeRock mixing and extrusion process and involved the conduct of pilot-scale production trials of AeRock products, and wherein Phase II involved the design, construction, and operation of a commercial-scale plant to confirm production issues and to produce panels for performance evaluations. Phase I optimized the composite ingredients including ash-based cement, Class F and Class C DFGD ash, and various fiber reinforcements. Additives, such as retardants and accelerators, were also evaluated as related to extruder performance. The optimized composite from the Phase I effort was characterized by a modulus of rupture (MOR) measured between 1, 931 and 2, 221 psi flexural strength, comparable to other wood and non-wood building materials. Continuous extrusion of the optimum composite in the AeRock pilot-scale facility produced an excellent product that was assembled into a demonstration for exhibit and durability purposes. Finishes, from plain to marbled, from bright reds to muted earth tones and with various textures, could easily be applied during the mixing and extrusion process. The successful pilot-scale demonstration was in turn used to design the production parameters and extruder dies for a commercial scale demonstration at Ultrapanel Pty, Ltd of Ballarat, Australia under Phase II. The initial commercial-scale production trials showed green product sagging, {{as a result of}} the die design. After the third die was acquired and fitted to the extruder, satisfactory decking and structural panels were produced. Cured decking was shipped to the US but experienced significant breakage and <b>damage</b> <b>during</b> <b>transport.</b> Subsequent evaluations concluded that an alternative die design was needed that would produce a more robust product resistant to damage. In summary, AeRock Decking can be a commercially-viable non-wood alternative decking product. This project has provided WRI and AeRock the knowledge and understanding to make AeRock Decking a commercial success. However, a commercial demonstration that produces quality product and the subsequent evaluation of its performance is needed before commercial acceptance of the AeRock product...|$|E
40|$|Stony corals (Order Scleractinia) are {{susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} diseases, which can occur from abiotic or biotic factors, or a combination of both. Public aquaria provide opportunities to study coral disease. Because coral mucus is {{the first line of defense}} against disease, the Biolog EcoplateTM is a useful tool to detect differences in microbial assemblages in the surface mucopolysaccharide (mucus) layer when comparing healthy and diseased corals. Histological examination is essential to document structural changes in coral tissue in response to diseases. This study identifies and characterizes diseases in captive corals through visual recognition, characterization of carbon utilization by microbial assemblages in coral mucus samples, and histological examination. In March 2010, surveys were sent to public aquaria throughout the United States that house corals. If the survey was returned indicating that the aquarium had diseased coral specimens present, sample kits were sent to the aquarium to acquire photographs, mucus samples for microbial carbon utilization analysis, and tissue samples for histological examination. Eighteen aquaria participated in the survey and 25 sets of samples were provided. The gross lesions from diseased samples fit into six categories: discoloration associated with darkening of the tissue or with color loss (bleaching), growth anomalies, and tissue loss associated with pests, with brown jelly, or with no obvious cause. Seven categories of possible contributing factors were reported: addition of inadequately quarantined corals to the tank, <b>damage</b> <b>during</b> <b>transport,</b> change of location, manual stress, and variations in light, salinity, or temperature. Introduction of inadequately quarantined specimens was the most common possible contributing factor to pest introduction. Significant differences in carbon source utilization were found between tank-water samples and mucus from both healthy and diseased areas of sampled corals. Although mucus samples from healthy and diseased samples did not differ in carbon source utilization overall, D-mannitol was used by 52 % of microbial assemblages from mucus from diseased areas compared with only 17 % of microbial assemblages from healthy mucus samples. Histologically, the most commonly observed features across all samples were healthy zooxanthellae, endolithic organisms, and nematocysts, all of which are normal features that can be influenced by stress factors. Brown granular material and ciliates were found associated with some anomalies, primarily the three categories of tissue loss. The presence of dense aggregates of zooxanthellate-engorged ciliates in corals afflicted with brown jelly was highly similar to histological observations of brown band syndrome, previously described from natural coral reefs...|$|E
40|$|In most countries, {{domestic}} {{transport of}} products is predominantly made on roads. Protective packaging {{is used to}} protect the freight from the shocks and vibration encountered during this type of transportation. Inefficient packaging constitutes a significant problem that costs {{hundreds of billions of}} dollars and has an important environmental impact. An insufficient level of packaging increases the occurrence of product <b>damage</b> <b>during</b> <b>transport,</b> whereas excessive packaging increases the packages weight and volume which is costly throughout the supply chain. In order to reduce these costs, packaging protection is currently optimised by simulating the vibration produced by road vehicles. Despite these simulations being prescribed by many standards, it is broadly acknowledged that these methods oversimplify the Road Vehicle Vibration (RVV) which imposes a significant limit on packaging optimisation. More complex RVV models have been recently developed to enhance simulations. However, the fundamental problem still remains; none of these alternatives consider the different excitation modes contained in RVV: i. e. the nonstationary random vibration induced by pavement’s profile and vehicle speed random variations; the shocks caused by pavement’s aberrations and discontinuities; and the sinusoidal (harmonic) vibration caused by unbalanced wheels and the engine-borne vibration. These excitation modes should be included in the RVV simulation to ensure that simulations are realistic and accurate and that the packaging will protect against vibration during transport without being too excessive. Each of these modes is represented by a different mathematical model and cannot be analysed with the same statistical tools. This means that they have to be characterised separately in order to create an accurate RVV simulation model. This task is challenging because all the excitation modes are simultaneously present in the acceleration signal recorded on a vehicle. This PhD thesis proposes to use machine learning to separate these modes from a signal. Being a first attempt to apply this approach to index RVV, the most common classification algorithms are used to identify the two predominant modes; i. e. the nonstationary vibration and the shocks. The important novelty of this approach is that algorithms integrate many RVV analysis methods such as moving statistics, the Discrete Wavelet Transform and the Hilbert-Huang Transform. A comprehensive evaluation and optimisation of the classification algorithms was performed using synthetically generated RVV signal. The best performing algorithm was applied on a real measurement dataset. The RVV mode decomposition will greatly increase the ability to correctly optimise the level of packaging required. An accurate model comprising all the characteristics inherent to RVV will be a considerable step forward to reduce unnecessary level of protective packaging without risking damage to products...|$|E
