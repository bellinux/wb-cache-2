25|$|Likely, current chemotherapies are not effective. Antiprogestin {{agents have}} been used, but with {{variable}} results. A 2007 study of whether <b>hydroxyurea</b> {{has the capacity}} to shrink unresectable or recurrent meningiomas is being further evaluated.|$|E
25|$|The care {{of people}} with sickle-cell disease may include {{infection}} prevention with vaccination and antibiotics, high fluid intake, folic acid supplementation, and pain medication. Other measures may include blood transfusion, and the medication hydroxycarbamide (<b>hydroxyurea).</b> A small proportion of people can be cured by a transplant of bone marrow cells.|$|E
25|$|In the past, antimetabolites (e.g., cytarabine, <b>hydroxyurea),</b> alkylating agents, {{interferon}} alfa 2b, and steroids {{were used as}} treatments of CML in the chronic phase, but since the 2000s {{have been replaced by}} Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitors drugs that specifically target BCR-ABL, the constitutively activated tyrosine kinase fusion protein caused by the Philadelphia chromosome translocation. Despite the move to replacing cytotoxic antineoplastics (standard anticancer drugs) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors sometimes <b>hydroxyurea</b> is still used to counteract the high leukocyte counts encountered during treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib; in these situations it may be the preferred myelosuppressive agent due to its relative lack of leukemogenic effects and hence the relative lack of potential for secondary hematologic malignancies to result from treatment. IRIS, an international study that compared interferon/cytarabine combination and the first of these new drugs imatinib, with long-term follow up, demonstrated the clear superiority of tyrosine-kinase-targeted inhibition over existing treatments.|$|E
25|$|Sickle-cell {{disease can}} be treated in mice. The mice – which have {{essentially}} the same defect that causes human cases – used a viral vector to induce production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which normally ceases to be produced shortly after birth. In humans, the use of <b>hydroxyurea</b> to stimulate the production of HbF temporarily alleviates sickle cell symptoms. The researchers demonstrated this treatment {{to be a more}} permanent means to increase therapeutic HbF production.|$|E
25|$|Azacitidine {{is a drug}} {{approved}} by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) {{for the treatment of}} CMML and by the European Medicines Agency for high risk non-proliferative CMML with 10-19% marrow blasts. It is a cytidine analogue that causes hypomethylation of DNA by inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. Decitabine is a similar drug to azacitidine and is {{approved by}} the FDA for treatments of all subtypes of MDS, including CMML. <b>Hydroxyurea</b> is a chemotherapy that is used in the myeloproliferative form of CMML to reduce cell numbers.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 it was {{reported}} that sickle-cell disease had been successfully treated in mice using gene therapy. The researchers used a viral vector to make the mice—which have essentially the same defect that causes human sickle cell disease—express production of fetal haemoglobin (HbF), which an individual normally ceases to produce shortly after birth. In humans, using <b>hydroxyurea</b> to stimulate the production of HbF has been known to temporarily alleviate sickle cell disease symptoms. The researchers demonstrated that this gene therapy method is a more permanent way to increase therapeutic HbF production.|$|E
2500|$|Beutler was {{the first}} to attempt pharmacologic {{intervention}} in sickle cell disease by increasing methemoglobin levels, carboxyhemoglobin levels, and fetal hemoglobin levels. [...] The latter approach depended on administration of estrogen, progesterone and human chorionic gonadotropin. [...] These attempts were unsuccessful, but set the stage for presaged the use of <b>hydroxyurea</b> as a treatment modality.|$|E
2500|$|The {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} the adeno-associated virus is a deficiency in replication and thus its inability to multiply in unaffected cells. [...] The first factor that was described as providing successful generation of new AAV particles, was the adenovirus, from which the AAV name originated. It was then shown that AAV replication can be facilitated by selected proteins derived from the adenovirus genome, by other viruses such as HSV, or by genotoxic agents, such as UV irradiation or <b>hydroxyurea.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Competence is {{specifically}} induced by DNA damaging conditions. [...] For instance, transformation is induced in Streptococcus pneumoniae by the DNA damaging agents mitomycin C (a DNA crosslinking agent) and fluoroquinolone (a topoisomerase inhibitor that causes double-strand breaks). [...] In B. subtilis, transformation is increased by UV light, a DNA damaging agent. In Helicobacter pylori, ciprofloxacin, which interacts with DNA gyrase and introduces double-strand breaks, induces expression of competence genes, thus enhancing {{the frequency of}} transformation Using Legionella pneumophila, Charpentier et al. tested 64 toxic molecules to determine which of these induce competence. [...] Of these only six, all DNA damaging agents, caused strong induction. [...] These DNA damaging agents were mitomycin C (which causes DNA inter-strand crosslinks), norfloxacin, ofloxacin and nalidixic acid (inhibitors of DNA gyrase that cause double-strand breaks), bicyclomycin (causes single- and double-strand breaks), and <b>hydroxyurea</b> (induces DNA base oxidation). [...] UV light also induced competence in L. pneumophila. [...] Charpentier et al. suggested that competence for transformation probably evolved as a DNA damage response.|$|E

5000|$|According to a 2005 Medical Research Council {{randomized}} trial, {{the combination}} of <b>hydroxyurea</b> with aspirin is superior to {{the combination of}} anagrelide and aspirin for the initial management of ET.

50|$|One common {{mechanism}} for synthesizing <b>hydroxyurea</b> {{is by the}} reaction of calcium cyanate with hydroxylamine nitrate in absolute ethanol and by the reaction of salt (i.e. sodium or potassium) cyanates and hydroxylamine hydrochloride in aqueous solution. <b>Hydroxyurea</b> has also been prepared by converting a quaternary ammonium anion exchange resin from the chloride form to the cyanate form with sodium cyanate and reacting the resin in the cyanate form with hydroxylamine hydrochloride.

50|$|Biochemical {{research}} has explored {{its role as}} a DNA replication inhibitor which causes deoxyribonucleotide depletion and results in DNA double strand breaks near replication forks (see DNA repair).

50|$|<b>Hydroxyurea</b> is a monohydroxyl-substituted urea (hydroxycarbamate) {{antimetabolite}}.

5000|$|<b>Hydroxyurea</b> : <b>Hydroxyurea</b> (HU) is {{an older}} {{medication}} (an antimetabolite) used for sickle-cell anemia {{and some other}} hematologic disorders. It enhances ddI, {{and to a lesser}} extent AZT and ddC. One possible explanation is that HU causes cells to spend more time in the [...] "S" [...] phase checkpoint of cellular growth which allows ddI, AZT and ddC into the cell more. In addition HU inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme used to break down certain proteins to form the building blocks of DNA called dNTPs. When dNTPs are depleted the cell tries to absorb more but if ddI, AZT or ddC is present it absorbs that due to the similarity, the net effect is more ddI, AZT or ddC enters the cell. HU can result in bone marrow suppression, and there are warnings that using HU with ddI can increase the risk of pancreatitis. The Health and Human Services (HHS) panel in the US is recommending against the use of <b>Hydroxyurea</b> although some doctors are still using it for various reasons.|$|E
