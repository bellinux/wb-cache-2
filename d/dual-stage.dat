This research finds the optimal power-split drive train for hybrid hydraulic city bus. The research approaches the optimization problem {{by studying the}} characteristics of possible configurations offered by the power-split architecture. The critical speed ratio (S_crit) is introduced in this research to represent power-split configurations and consequently simplifies the optimal configuration search process. This methodology allows the research to find the optimal configurations among the more complicated <b>dual-staged</b> power-split architecture. The search for optimal single-staged and <b>dual-staged</b> power-split configurations is done by tuning the S_crit values until the optimal configuration is reached. The configuration candidates are simulated over three city bus drive cycles and to ensure they operate at optimal condition at each drive cycle, a dynamic programming is used. This study also establishes {{that there are two}} kinds of power re-circulation modes and one of them has a usable range with better efficiency than the series hybrid hydraulic architecture. A configuration candidate from single-staged power-split architecture is chosen to be the optimal drive train. The (S_crit value of the optimal configuration is used to determine how all the gears in the optimal power-split HHB drive train are connected and the planetary gear ratio so that the physical drive train can be built...|$|R
40|$|In the {{emerging}} field of adaptive biometrics, systems aim to adapt enrolled templates to variations in samples observed during operations. However, despite numerous advantages, few commercial vendors have adopted auto-update procedures in their products. This {{is due to}} limitations associated with existing adaptation schemes. This paper proposes a <b>dual-staged</b> template adaptation scheme that allows to capture `informative' operational samples with significant variations but without increasing the vulnerability to impostor intrusion. This is achieved through a two staged classification-selection approach driven by the harmonic function and risk minimization technique, over a graph based representation of (enrolment and operational) samples. Experimental results on the DIEE fingerprint data set, explicitly collected for evaluating adaptive biometric systems, demonstrate that the proposed scheme results in 67 % reduction in error over the baseline system (without adaptation), outperforming state-of-the-art method...|$|R

40|$|A quasi-mono-energetic x-ray source, {{produced}} by laser Compton scattering of laser wakefield accelerated electrons, is demonstrated {{for the first}} time [1]. The peak spectral brightness of the source compares with or exceeds that of conventional, radio-frequency (RF) -based sources, but at significantly lower cost and smaller footprint. The beams are expected to have among the shortest temporal duration of any high energy x-ray source produced to date. ^ The source was composed of a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) and Compton scattering undulator. The LWFA uses a laser to drive a plasma wave. Spatial and temporal properties of the drive beam were matched to the plasma resonance conditions. A near-diffraction-limited, near-transform limited and low contrast intense laser was produced using spatial and temporal phase correction and temporal gating. The high-quality laser parameters resulted in effective self-guiding over several Rayleigh lengths and stable acceleration. ^ A <b>dual-staged</b> gas jet target was designed to independently control e-beam characteristics [2]. The first stage used a He/N 2 gas mixture to inject electrons, by ionization, into the accelerator. Increasing the density and nitrogen content of this jet increased the e-beam charge. The second stage used pure helium to further accelerate the injected electrons. The e-beam energy was increased, while maintaining the energy spread by increasing the density and length of the second jet. The e-beams were characterized by relatively high charge (∼ 20 pC), low divergence (∼ 10 mrad), small source size (∼ 1 µm), and low energy spread (3 ̆c 25...|$|R

2500|$|The Lexus LFA {{is powered}} by a 72-degree bank angle 4.8-liter V10 engine {{equipped}} with dual VVT-i carrying the 1LR-GUE designation with a maximum output of [...] delivered at 8,700rpm. Its maximum torque output of [...] arrives at 6,800rpm, 90percent of which is available from 3,700rpm. The engine redlines at 9,000rpm, but with a fuel cutoff set at 9,500rpm, and is constructed using forged aluminum pistons, forged titanium connecting rods, and solid titanium valves. The V-angle of the LFA's V-10 engine is set to 72-degrees to fully balance the firing force from the pistons. This 72-degree angle allows for even firing from the pistons without the use of a split-journal crankshaft, thus improving engine efficiency as well as lowering overall weight. Dry sump lubrication prevents engine oil starvation through high speed corners and lowers the engine's center of mass. Air is fed directly from beneath the hood through a visible slit passing into a dual stage variable intake manifold and then into ten individual throttle bodies before finally exiting from a <b>dual-stage</b> titanium muffler.|$|E

5000|$|The {{mirror in}} a <b>dual-stage</b> reflectron has two regions (stages) with {{different}} fields. This {{makes it possible}} to zero both the first and second derivatives of t(U) with respect to energy U. That is why <b>dual-stage</b> reflectrons can compensate flight times over larger variations in ion kinetic energy compared to single-stage ones. This type of reflectrons is typically employed in orthogonal acceleration (oa) TOF MS. [...] "Classical" [...] (i.e., Mamyrin's) design includes two highly transparent conductive grids separating regions with homogeneous fields. In general, the first stage (section) of the reflectron has high electric field, in this section the ions decelerate losing 2/3 or more of their kinetic energy depending on the reflectron parameters; the second stage has lower field, in this stage the ions are repelled toward the first region. Mass resolution in <b>dual-stage</b> reflectron is mainly determined by ion scattering on the grids, the spread of kinetic energy of ions leaving the pulsed ion source, and accuracy of mechanical alignment. To diminish effect of scattering, the length of the first deceleration region should be relatively large. Ion scattering makes using triple- and further stage reflectrons impractical.|$|E
