500|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of the sketch and Fey's impression of Palin, Fey reprised her role during the September 27, 2008 episode. That sketch featured Palin being interviewed by Katie Couric (Amy Poehler), and parodied an interview which took place between Palin and Couric which aired days before the sketch's broadcast. In the sketch, Fey quoted near verbatim one of Palin's answers from the actual interview and mimed Palin's gestures. [...] The following episode featured a skit parodying the debate between Palin and Joe Biden (played by Jason Sudeikis). Queen Latifah also appeared in the skit as moderator <b>Gwen</b> <b>Ifill.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Imus's {{behavior}} has often drawn {{the attention of}} the press. He famously called Rush Limbaugh [...] "a fat, pill-popping loser" [...] and a [...] "drug-addled gas bag", <b>Gwen</b> <b>Ifill</b> a [...] "cleaning lady" [...] and Lesley Stahl a [...] "gutless, lying weasel." [...] His comedic exchange of quips ("fat pig") regarding his show's former news reader, Contessa Brewer, made news, as did Brewer's response ("cantankerous old fool"). When Tucker Carlson brought up Brewer on the program in 2005, Imus hung up on him, calling him [...] "a bowtie-wearing little pussy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{disappearance}} of Figueroa has spawned controversy about {{media coverage of}} missing people and how cases get national attention, with the terms [...] "Missing White Women Syndrome." [...] PBS journalist <b>Gwen</b> <b>Ifill</b> referred to the phenomenon as [...] "The Missing White Woman Syndrome" [...] at the Unity Convention of Journalists in 2004 [...] This phrase was invoked by Professor of American Studies Sheri L. Parks) [...] on March 13, 2006 during an interview with American news reporter, Anderson Cooper to describe a phenomenon characterized by critics as a short and cynical equation: Pretty, white damsels in distress draw viewers; missing women who are black, Latino, Asian, old, fat, or ugly do not. Critics accused major news outlets of ignoring Figueroa's disappearance to focus on cases involving young, usually attractive, white women like Laci Peterson who was also pregnant when she was reported missing.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} Imus was suspended. Media commentators {{were divided}} on the suspension: on MSNBC's Scarborough Country on April 10, for example, Pat Buchanan said that Imus is [...] "a good guy... made a bad mistake and apologized for it" [...] and that the show should stay on the air. Comedian Bill Maher said that if a comedian apologizes for stepping over a line, that should suffice. Steve Adubato, an MSNBC media analyst, disagreed, saying that this incident was [...] "not isolated". Joe Klein made the same charge, referring to Imus's comment about New York Times reporter <b>Gwen</b> <b>Ifill</b> 14 years before as evidence of a pattern of offensive comments. On The View, Rosie O'Donnell spoke out in support of keeping Imus on the air on free speech grounds, while Emil Steiner of The Washington Post argued that Al Sharpton used the issue to further divide America along racial lines.|$|E
