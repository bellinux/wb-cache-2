5|$|The {{character}} Walter Skinner {{was played}} by actor Mitch Pileggi, who had unsuccessfully auditioned for {{the roles of}} two or three other characters on The X-Files before getting the part. At first, {{the fact that he was}} asked back to audition for the recurring role slightly puzzled him, until he discovered the reason he had not previously been cast in those roles—Carter had been unable to envision Pileggi as any of those characters, because the actor had been shaving his head. When Pileggi auditioned for Walter Skinner, he had been in a grumpy mood and had allowed his small amount of hair to grow. His attitude fit well with Skinner's character, causing Carter to assume that the actor was only pretending to be grumpy. Pileggi later realized he had been lucky that he had not been cast in one of the earlier roles, as he believed he would have appeared in only a single episode and would <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to play the recurring role.|$|E
5|$|The group goes to IBF {{in search}} for a cure, but starts showing signs of Tief Blau. An {{exception}} is Tsugumi, as the Cure virus has made her immune; the group injects themselves with her antibodies. They get contact with the surface, and a rescue pod is sent down, but is only able {{to stay for a}} short period of time. Tsugumi disappears to find Chami, who has gone missing; Takeshi chases after her, and saves Sora's data onto a disk, to save her memories. Returning to IBF, they <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> rescue vessel. They find a submarine and escape, but its batteries die; Takeshi exits it, giving it enough buoyancy to save Tsugumi, while he dies on the ocean floor. Coco dies in IBF, as she had been looking for Pipi, and the rescue team could not find her.|$|E
5|$|Maricello's super soft tyres {{began to}} degrade quickly, {{allowing}} Rossi and Vandoorne to draw closer {{over the next}} two laps. Rossi caught Maricello by the start of the sixth lap but the latter remained on the circuit. King, who was delayed by a long queue of vehicles behind him, was the first driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the same lap and rejoined the track in clear air. On lap eight, Matsushita collided heavily with de Jong at the Novelle chicane, causing him to retire and was later penalised with a three-place grid penalty for the sprint race after the stewards judged him to <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> corner's braking point. De Jong was able to continue. Marciello made his pit stop for new tyres on the next lap, allowing Rossi and Vandoorne to move into the first and second places and both drivers built an advantage over the remainder of the field. Maricello rejoined in eleventh, behind Pic, who made his pit stop one lap later. Sørensen was placed into the Casino Hairpin barriers at the apex of the corner by Nato on lap ten, ending his race. Nato was issued with a ten-second time penalty, but no safety car was deployed. Marvelov retired from the race in the pit lane with damage to his car after running off the circuit, and drove over a kerb exiting the left-hand Louis Chiron corner, causing him to become airborne, and hit the barriers lining the track.|$|E

25|$|After three years, {{during which}} {{surveyors}} sometimes had to rappel down the mountain's cliffs {{to mark the}} route, construction began in 1916.

Accordingly, the specifications for the project were changed. The planned road was widened from , with a three-foot (1 m) concrete gutter.|$|E
25|$|Azhar Ali was {{appointed}} Pakistan's captain {{for the second}} Test after Misbah-ul-Haq left the tour {{after the death of}} his father-in-law. Misbah-ul-Haq was later given a one-match suspension by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for Pakistan's slow over rate in the first Test, and he would <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> second Test because of this. Mitchell Santner replaced James Neesham in New Zealand's squad ahead of the second Test. Trent Boult was ruled out of the second Test with a knee injury and was replaced by Doug Bracewell.|$|E
25|$|After {{initially}} {{struggling in}} their first two seasons, the Mighty Ducks improved {{under the leadership of}} center Paul Kariya, who first got the team to two playoff appearances in 1997 and 1999 while forming a potent line with Teemu Selänne, and later rode the strong goaltending of Jean-Sébastien Giguère to a Cinderella run to the franchise's first Stanley Cup Finals appearance in 2003, lost to the New Jersey Devils in seven games. Once Disney sold the franchise in 2005 to Henry and Susan Samueli, the team's name was changed to Anaheim Ducks before the 2006–07 season, where the Ducks won the Stanley Cup in five games over the Ottawa Senators. The Ducks <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> playoffs only twice since then.|$|E

25|$|Quarterback Brett Favre threw three {{touchdown}} passes against the Chargers in the victory, bringing his career total to 420 and tying Dan Marino's career touchdown record. With {{just over two}} minutes remaining {{in the game and}} San Diego leading 21–17, Favre found wide receiver Greg Jennings for a 57-yard catch-and-run across {{the middle of the field}} for the go ahead score. On the Chargers ensuing drive, linebacker Nick Barnett intercepted a Philip Rivers pass and returned it to the San Diego 1-yard line setting up the Packers final score and a 10-point lead. Barnett was voted the GMC Defensive Player of the Week for games played on September 23 – 24. This win made the Packers the only team to <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> playoffs the previous season to return to open 3–0 against teams that made the playoffs the year before.|$|E
25|$|In June, Milner {{competed for}} England at the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. He played {{in all four}} of England's matches and was booked in the semi-final against the Netherlands, which meant he would <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> final. The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out, in which Milner scored twice and England lost 13–12. Milner was {{included}} in the under-21 squad for a friendly against Romania, which ended in a 1–1 draw. A month later, Milner set an England under-21 record by making his 30th appearance for the team in a 3–0 win against Montenegro. During this match, he set up the first goal from a corner. Historically, players with several England Under-21 appearances have not progressed to become regulars in the senior team, which has led some to doubt whether Milner would be able to successfully make the transition. In October, he scored his third goal for the under-21 team in a 3–0 win over Republic of Ireland. He scored again in the return match four months later that England also won 3–0.|$|E
25|$|The Spurs {{finished}} the 1995–96 season under Hill at 59–23 {{and lost in}} the Western Conference semi-finals. Few observers could have predicted how far the Spurs would fall during the 1996–97 season, especially with the signing of Dominique Wilkins. Robinson missed {{the first month of}} the season due to a back injury. He returned in December, but played only six games before a broken foot sidelined him {{for the rest of the}} season. Elliott also missed more than half the season due to injury. Without Robinson and Elliott, the Spurs were a rudderless team. The lone bright spot was Wilkins, leading the team in scoring with an average of 18.2 ppg. The Spurs ended the season with a 20–62 record, the worst in franchise history—and to date, the last time they <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> playoffs. Hill only lasted 18 games as coach that season, eventually being fired and replaced by general manager Gregg Popovich, who had also served a stint under Brown as an assistant coach. Wilkins would play his lone season in 1996–97 for San Antonio, knowing his minutes and playing time would greatly diminish next season.|$|E

25|$|Twelve {{seconds before}} the plane hit the mountain, named El Diluvio (The Deluge), the Ground Proximity Warning System activated, announcing an {{imminent}} terrain collision and sounding an alarm. Within a second of this warning the first officer disengaged the autopilot, and the captain attempted to climb clear of the mountain; however, neither pilot had remembered to disengage the previously deployed speed brakes, which reduced the rate of climb. At 9:41:28 pm Eastern Standard Time it struck trees at about 8,900 feet MSL {{on the east side}} of the mountain. The crash was six miles south of Tuluá VOR and 28 miles north of the approach end of runway 19 at Alfonso Bonilla Aragon International Airport. During the investigations, it was found that neither the Boeing fixed-base simulator nor the CDU/FMS simulator could be backdriven with the data obtained directly from the accident airplane's flight data recorder. Because the B-757 flight simulators could not be backdriven during the tests, it could not be determined with precision whether the airplane would <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> mountain/tree tops if the speedbrakes had been retracted during the escape attempt. However, the final report stated that if the flightcrew had retracted the speedbrakes one second after initiating the escape maneuver, the airplane could have been climbing through a position that was 150 feet above the initial impact point. Because the airplane would have continued to climb and had the potential to increase its rate of climb, it might well have cleared the trees at the top of the mountain.|$|E

500|$|Elms {{suggests}} Bettelheim may <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> anal {{aspect of}} the tale {{that would make it}} helpful to the child's personality development. In Handbook of Psychobiography Elms describes Southey's tale not as one of Bettelheimian post-Oedipal ego development but as one of Freudian pre-Oedipal anality. He believes the story appeals chiefly to preschoolers who are engaged in [...] "cleanliness training, maintaining environmental and behavioral order, and distress about disruption of order". His own experience and his observation of others lead him to believe children align themselves with the tidy, organized ursine protagonists rather than the unruly, delinquent human antagonist. In Elms's view, the anality of [...] "The Story of the Three Bears" [...] can be traced directly to Robert Southey's fastidious, dirt-obsessed aunt who raised him and passed her obsession to him in a milder form.|$|E
500|$|According to Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, Murdoch told Captain Smith {{that he was}} {{attempting}} to [...] "hard-a-port around [...] ", suggesting that he {{was attempting}} a [...] "port around" [...] manoeuvre– to first swing the bow around the obstacle, then swing the stern so that {{both ends of the}} ship would avoid a collision. There was a delay before either order went into effect; the steam-powered steering mechanism took up to 30seconds to turn the ship's tiller, and the complex task of setting the engines into reverse would also have taken some time to accomplish. Because the centre turbine could not be reversed, both it and the centre propeller, positioned {{directly in front of the}} ship's rudder, were simply stopped. This reduced the rudder's effectiveness, therefore impairing the turning ability of the ship. Had Murdoch simply turned the ship while maintaining her forward speed, Titanic might <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> iceberg with feet to spare.|$|E
500|$|Original Stories {{gained a}} {{reputation}} in the 20th century as an oppressively didactic book and was derided by early scholars of children’s literature such as Geoffrey Summerfield. Recent scholars, particularly Mitzi Myers, have re-evaluated Wollstonecraft’s book and 18th-century children’s literature in general, assessing it within its historical context rather than judging it according to modern tastes. Myers suggests, in her series of seminal articles, that women writers of children’s literature such as Mary Wollstonecraft and Maria Edgeworth were not only using the genre of children’s literature to teach but also to promote visions of society distinct {{from those of the}} Romantics. These authors believed that they could effect great change by exposing young children to their ideas of a better society, even though they were [...] "only" [...] writing stories about seemingly insignificant topics such as small animals or little girls. Myers argues that because scholars have traditionally paid more attention to Romantic poetry and prose (the works of William Wordsworth and Percy Bysshe Shelley, for example) than to children’s literature, they <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> social critique that these women writers of children’s literature were offering.|$|E
