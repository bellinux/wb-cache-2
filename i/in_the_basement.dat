5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} guards, there may have been an opportunity for {{one or more of the}} guards to rescue a survivor. Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> with the bodies.|$|E

5|$|Firefighters began {{experiencing}} {{problems before}} they even reached the fire. By the time firefighters reached the 11th floor the building had lost power after {{the heat from the}} blaze damaged electrical cables. The emergency generator never began producing electricity, and despite efforts to restore power the building was without electricity for the entirety of the event. This forced firefighters to work in darkness and without the aid of elevators. In addition, the transformers that provided power to the neighboring Girard Trust Building were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> of One Meridian Plaza. The transformers were eventually shut down due to water accumulation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> and firefighters directing water streams from that building had to do so without the aid of elevators.|$|E
5|$|In late December {{the last}} of the {{survivors}} that were able to be extricated were pulled from the fallen buildings, rescue operations ceased, and the cleanup began, beginning with the destruction of buildings that were too heavily damaged to be repaired. Six friends were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> of a nine-story building relocating barrels when it came down around them on December 7. Their injuries were minor, but one person did suffer a broken arm.

5|$|Although much {{is known}} of Little's {{investment}} activities in his adult life, {{little is known about}} his early years. Jacob Little was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts on March 17, 1794. The son of a successful local shipbuilder and of Quaker origin, Little exhibited a strong understanding of money and financial markets from an early age. In 1817 he emigrated to New York City and became a clerk in the store of Jacob Barker, a highly successful financier, merchant, and politically well-connected founding member of the Democratic Party political machine Tammany Hall. Little spent five years in apprenticeship under Barker before moving out in 1822 to start his own business with $700 he had accrued over the length of his employment. He bought a small office <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> of a Wall Street building, which served as his base of operations for the next twelve years, before moving out of his old office to a new one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> of the old exchange building in 1834, from which he opened a brokerage—the start of his investment career.|$|E

40|$|The {{protection}} afforded against simulated fall-out radiation {{has been}} evaluated for several typical homes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Oak Ridge area. Nine houses {{were chosen to}} represent a variety of construction materials, topographical conditions and sizes; they included three types of Oak Ridge Cemesto houses, one concrete-block house with a basement fall-out shelter, and two wood-frame houses. The protection factor (ratio of open-field exposure dose rate to exposure dose rate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house) <b>in</b> all these houses ranged from 2 to 5 {{on the main floor}} and from 5 to 30 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basements,</b> except <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fall-out shelter, where the protection factor was greater than 100. The analysis showed that sloping lots. common to Oak Ridge, do not appreciably affect the protection factor for the main floor. Owing to the generally increased exposure of <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> walls on such lots, <b>the</b> protection factors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> were typically lower than in similar basements built on level lots.
