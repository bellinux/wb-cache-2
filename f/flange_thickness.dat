The measurement was done with the Neutron Diffraction Method using the Neutron Diffractometer DN 1 -M PSTBM BATAN.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the details of}} an experimental investigation on the section moment capacities of rivet fastened Rectangular Hollow Flange Channel Beams (RHFCB). The rivet fastened RHFCB is {{a new type of}} cold-formed steel section, an extension to the widely researched hollow flange beams, shown to have capacities more typically associated with hot-rolled steel beams. It is characterized by a unique geometry, consisting of two rectangular hollow flanges and a web. Unlike other cold-formed sections, the RHFCB has improved capacity due to its mono-symmetric shape and the absence of free edges. The RHFCB manufacturing involves fastening two hollow flanges to a web, utilizing inexpensive intermittent self-pierced rivet fastening. This enables designers to develop optimum sections with varying web and <b>flange</b> <b>thicknesses,</b> therefore delaying the onset of other buckling failures due to slender web element. Various researches have been carried out to investigate the behavior of continuously welded hollow flange beams but little is known on the behavior of RHFCBs. Hence this paper investigates the section moment capacities of rivet fastened RHFCBs. Fifteen section moment capacity tests were conducted to investigate the behavior of RHFCB flexural members. The reduction in section moment capacities from having continuous weld to intermittent rivet connection at its web-flange junction was also investigated. The ultimate moment capacities from the tests were compared with current steel design standards: AS/NZS 4600, AS 4100 and AISI S 100. The paper also explores the suitability of the Direct Strength Method, with modification being proposed, from the results obtained from this investigation...|$|R

40|$|Economic Tyre Turning (ETT) is {{the process}} of turning wheels to a profile that has the same tread shape but a thinner flange than the design case, {{allowing}} less material to be removed from the wheel diameter. ETT can allow maintainers to extend wheel life, particularly when the wheel is approaching its minimum diameter. Modern wheel lathes are typically capable of turning such profiles but GB railway group standards do not currently permit their use. This paper investigates the effect of using ETT wheel profiles on the wheel-rail interface, in terms of wear and rolling contact fatigue (RCF) damage. It demonstrates how a Wheel Profile Damage Model (WPDM) can be used to accurately predict both the magnitude of wheel wear and the worn shape of the wheel for mileages exceeding 100, 000 miles since turning. The paper presents results for one suburban and one inter-city train fleet. It discusses the validation of the wear prediction using data from the real fleets and the calibration methodology used to adjust the Archard wear model within the WPDM to improve the accuracy of the simulation results for specific routes. Having established that wear patterns can be predicted with a good degree of accuracy, the paper then examines how the predicted wear performance changes when wheel profiles with thin flanges (four different <b>flange</b> <b>thicknesses</b> at 1 mm intervals from 28 mm to 25 mm) are used.

Eurocode does not provide adequate design information for mechanical properties prediction of top-seat flange cleat connection, especially for thin-walled cold-formed steel structures. Adopting hot-rolled design with neglecting thin-walled behaviour could lead to unsafe or uneconomic design. This research aims to provide accurate mechanical properties prediction for bolted top-seat flange cleat connection in cold-formed steel structures. The scope of work focuses on the effect of various <b>thickness</b> of the <b>flange</b> cleat to the rotational stiffness and strength behaviour of a beam-to-column connection.

The importance of the plate thickness on the magnitude of residual stress has been highlighted as well.

40|$|In many steel {{structures}} like buildings, industrial halls and bridges, standardized hot-rolled sections are used. These sections {{are divided into}} specific types in Europe and similar profiles in the USA. The range of hot-rolled sections is limited and therefore fabricated plate girders are used when the standard hot-rolled sections {{do not meet the}} requirements for stiffness, strength, stability and economy. Such a plate girder is built up from steel plates for the top and bottom flange and for the web, welded together to an I-shape cross-section, single or double symmetric. Using this type of plate girders, a high degree of optimisation of material use is achieved by using different plate thickness and width for the <b>flanges,</b> and <b>thickness</b> and height for the web over the span of the girder adapted to the distribution of bending moments and the shear forces. A model is developed for the distribution of a certain amount of steel over the flanges and the web of a plate girder to achieve the maximum bending moment resistance.

The results of FEM models are validated with an test performed at the Lehigh University and with ten tests on plate girders performed at the Delft University of Technology.

40|$|This {{paper is}} about the laser {{measurements}} {{as part of the}} research on the distribution of a certain amount of steel over the flanges and the web of an I-shaped plate girder to achieve the maximum bending moment resistance [1]. In many steel structures standard hot-rolled sections are used. These sections are divided into specific types in Europe and similar profiles in the USA. The range of hot-rolled sections is limited and therefore fabricated plate girders are used. Double symmetric I-shaped plate girders are built up with steel plates for the top and bottom flange and the web, welded together to a cross-section. Using this type of plate girders, a high degree of optimisation of material use is possible by using different plate thicknesses and widths for the <b>flanges</b> and <b>thickness</b> and height for the web. In the thesis the main topic for optimisation is the bending moment resistance of a plate girder. The maximum bending moment resistance appears for plate girders with a lot of material in the flanges and with a large web height. The web thickness has to be as small as possible and so the web slenderness has to be as large as possible. The limitation of the web slenderness is according to the Eurocode and the American standard based on flange induced buckling. The web of cross-section class 4 buckles and this buckling is during experiments measured by lasers. This paper gives an overview {{of the results of the}} laser measurements. Based on these measurements, it is concluded that flange induce buckling is not a limitation for the web slenderness. High web slenderness can be applied and the bending moment resistance increases enormously and the stiffness increases even more. Because of this, the use of HSS becomes of high interest.
