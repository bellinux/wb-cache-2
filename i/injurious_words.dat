60|$|Dorothea when {{thoroughly}} moved cared little {{what any}} one {{thought of her}} feelings; and {{even if she had}} been able to reflect, she would have held it petty to keep silence at <b>injurious</b> <b>words</b> about Will from fear of being herself misunderstood. Her face was flushed and her lip trembled.|$|E
60|$|These {{outrageous}} dealings of {{the governor}} were not confined to those, who made these remonstrances {{to him from the}} Father; they extended even to the saint himself, whom he looked on as the author and head of the enterprize. It is incredible what <b>injurious</b> <b>words</b> he gave him, and how rudely he treated him on several occasions; insomuch, that it was the common talk of Malacca, that this persecution might pass for the martyrdom of Father Xavier. The servant of God resented nothing which was done to his own person. He blessed God continually, for giving him occasions of suffering; but he was extremely sensible of what religion and the progress of the gospel suffered, and was often seen to weep abundantly.|$|E
60|$|If {{there was}} any dreadful {{punishment}} to be inflicted, or cruel deed of any kind to be performed, Caligula took great pleasure in assigning the duty to Chærea, knowing how abhorrent to his nature it must be. At one time a senator of great distinction named Propedius, was accused of treason {{by one of his}} enemies. His treason consisted, as the accuser alledged, of having spoken <b>injurious</b> <b>words</b> against the emperor. Propedius denied that he had ever spoken such words. The accuser, whose name was Timidius, cited a certain Quintilia, an actress, as his witness. Propedius was accordingly brought to trial, and Quintilia was called upon before the judges to give her testimony. She denied that she had ever heard Propedius utter any such sentiment as Timidius attributed to him. Timidius then said that Quintilia was testifying falsely: he declared that she had heard Propedius utter such words, and demanded that she should be put to the torture to compel her to acknowledge it. The emperor acceded to this demand, and commanded Chærea to put the actress to the torture.|$|E
6000|$|Franklin's {{grotesque}} mortal envelope {{had disappeared}} from the poop to seek its needful repose, if only the worried soul would let it rest a while. Mr Powell, half sorry for the thick little man, wondered whether it would let him. For himself, he recognised that the charm of a quiet watch on deck when one may let one's thoughts roam {{in space and time}} had been spoiled without remedy. What shocked him most was the implied aspersion of complicity on Mrs Anthony. It angered him. In his own words to me, he felt very [...] "enthusiastic" [...] about Mrs Anthony. [...] "Enthusiastic" [...] is good; especially as he couldn't exactly explain to me what he meant by it. But he felt enthusiastic, he says. That silly Franklin must have been dreaming. That was it. He had dreamed it all. Ass. Yet the <b>injurious</b> <b>word</b> stuck in Powell's mind with its associated ideas of prisoner, of escape. He became very uncomfortable. And just then (it might have been half an hour or more since he had relieved Franklin) just then Mr Smith came up on the poop alone, like a gliding shadow and leaned over the rail by his side. Young Powell was affected disagreeably by his presence. He made a movement to go away but the other began to talk--and Powell remained where he was as if retained by a mysterious compulsion. The conversation started by Mr Smith had nothing peculiar. He began to talk of mail-boats in general and in the end seemed anxious to discover what were the services from Port Elizabeth to London. Mr Powell did not know for certain but imagined that there must be communication with England at least twice a month. [...] "Are you thinking of leaving us, sir; of going home by steam? Perhaps with Mrs Anthony," [...] he asked anxiously.|$|R
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{common ragwort}} (Senecio jacobaea) {{is one of}} the five plants named as an {{injurious}} weed under the provisions of the Weeds Act 1959. The <b>word</b> <b>injurious</b> in this context indicates that it could be harmful to agriculture not that it is dangerous to animals, as all the other injurious weeds listed are non-toxic. Under the terms of this Act, a land occupier can be required by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs {{to prevent the spread of}} the plant. However, the growth of the plant is not made illegal by the Act and there is no statutory obligation for control placed upon landowners in general.|$|R
60|$|But this {{gossip about}} Bulstrode spread through Middlemarch like {{the smell of}} fire. Mr. Frank Hawley {{followed}} up his information by sending a clerk whom he could trust to Stone Court on a pretext of inquiring about hay, but really to gather all that could be learned about Raffles and his illness from Mrs. Abel. In this way it came to his knowledge that Mr. Garth had carried the man to Stone Court in his gig; and Mr. Hawley in consequence took an opportunity of seeing Caleb, calling at his office to ask whether {{he had time to}} undertake an arbitration if it were required, and then asking him incidentally about Raffles. Caleb was betrayed into no <b>word</b> <b>injurious</b> to Bulstrode beyond the fact which he was forced to admit, that he had given up acting for him within the last week. Mr Hawley drew his inferences, and feeling convinced that Raffles had told his story to Garth, and that Garth had given up Bulstrode's affairs in consequence, said so a few hours later to Mr. Toller. The statement was passed on until it had quite lost the stamp of an inference, and was taken as information coming straight from Garth, so that even a diligent historian might have concluded Caleb to be the chief publisher of Bulstrode's misdemeanors.|$|R
60|$|It is, of course, always {{difficult}} {{to ascertain the}} precise truth in respect to such transactions as those that are connected with plots and conspiracies against tyrants, since every possible precaution is, of course, taken by all concerned to conceal what is done. It is probable, however, in this case, that Propedius had cherished some hostile designs against Caligula, {{if he had not}} uttered <b>injurious</b> <b>words,</b> and that Quintilia was in some measure in his confidence. It is even possible that Chærea may have been connected with them in some secret design, for it is said that when he received the orders of Caligula to put Quintilia to the torture he was greatly agitated and alarmed. If he should apply the torture severely, he feared that the unhappy sufferer might be induced to make confessions or statements at least, which would bring destruction on the men whom he most relied upon for the overthrow of Caligula. On the other hand, if he should attempt to spare her, the effect would be only to provoke the anger of Caligula against himself, without at all shielding or saving her. As, however, he was proceeding to the place of torture, in charge of his victim, with his mind in this state of anxiety and indecision, his fears were somewhat relieved by a private signal given to him by Quintilia, by which she intimated to him that he need feel no concern,--that she would be faithful and true, and would reveal nothing, whatever might be done to her.|$|E
