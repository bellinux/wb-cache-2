2500|$|There were {{numerous}} reasons {{leading to the}} birth of the Neo Destour: The Great Depression and its impact in Tunisia, in the early 1930s, the reactions denouncing the international eucharistic congress of Carthage, held to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the French colonization of Algeria, the Tunisian naturalization issue but mainly the policy and behavior adopted by the Destour towards these events. Indeed, the party activism decreased {{in the midst of the}} 1920s, precisely on January 29, 1926, when [...] "scoundrel decrees" [...] were enacted by the Residence, the French colonial administration. In result, the first exclusively Tunisian labour union, the General Confederation of Tunisian Workers (GCTW), founded by Mohamed Ali El Hammi, was dissolved. <b>Furthemore,</b> nationalist newspapers such as Ifriqiya, Al-Asr, Al Jadid and Le Libéral were prohibited. The party soon bursted in pieces with the departure of Hassen Guellaty and Mohamed Noomane, who founded the Reformist Destourian Party, but also Farhat Ben Ayed, who created the Independent Destourian Party. In this context, a new generation of nationalists emerged.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} 1960s the descarga genre was revitalized in New York by the Alegre All-Stars, an {{ensemble}} featuring {{the most successful}} artists in the Alegre Records roster. The albums were produced by Al Santiago, who chose Charlie Palmieri as music director, {{and they would have}} a major influence on the development of salsa, launching the careers of artists such as Johnny Pacheco, Cheo Feliciano and Barry Rogers. <b>Furthemore,</b> in 1965 Alegre released Puerto Rican All-Stars featuring Kako, a jam-session recorded in February 1963 and led by prolific timbalero Francisco Ángel Bastar [...] "Kako" [...] which featured Rafael Ithier and Roberto Roena among others. Soon, Alegre's biggest competitor, Tico, launched its own [...] "house band", the Tico All-Stars, playing the same style of [...] "Nuyorican" [...] descargas. Meanwhile, the Alegre All-Stars project was continued by Al Santiago under different names, namely Cesta All-Stars and Salsa All-Stars. In 1968, Jerry Masucci and Johnny Pacheco, the owners of New York's leading salsa label, Fania Records, decided to start another project in the vein of the Alegre All-Stars but with a different approach: the music would now revolve around large-ensemble salsa played live instead of the 1950s Panart studio descarga style. The band, the Fania All-Stars, debuted in 1968 at the Red Garter in Greenwich Village with a lineup that included Ray Barretto, Joe Bataan, Willie Colón, Bobby Valentín and Larry Harlow among others, plus guests Eddie Palmieri, Tito Puente and Richie Ray. The concert was recorded and divided into two LPs, Live at the Red Garter Volumes I and II, which were moderately successful.|$|E

5000|$|John Bradshaw Layfield's push in 2004 {{that would}} change him from a tag team partner to a SmackDown main eventer that would held the WWE Championship for 280 days (the longest reign in a decade) is often seen as go away heat due the push being forced and undeserving. In WWE's defense, {{it should be noted}} that SmackDown's roster was short of villain main eventers due Brock Lesnar leaving the company and Kurt Angle due once again suffer from {{legitimate}} neck problems, with then reigning WWE Champion Eddie Guerrero wanting to drop the title due major pression and feeling responsible for the lack of crowd attendence at SmackDown's live events. Layfield would not improve things on SmackDown during his reign and actually drew even less. <b>Furthemore,</b> Layfield's matches on pay-per-view were not well received, including his WrestleMania 21 match with John Cena in which he lost the title.

5000|$|During Survivor Series on November 20, Ellsworth hid {{under the}} ring and grabbed Braun Strowmans leg {{to prevent him from}} getting back in the ring, {{resulting}} in Strowman getting eliminated by countout, only for Strowman to chase Ellsworth up the ramp and put him through a table, injuring his neck. After legitimately signing a WWE contract, this was worked into a storyline on the 22 November episode of SmackDown Live, when Styles goaded the injured Ellsworth to face him in a ladder match for the right to be a SmackDown superstar with his contract suspended above the ring; Ellsworth agreed, but wanted another shot at the WWE World Championship should he win the match. That night, Ellsworth defeated Styles to win a SmackDown contract, due to Ambrose (who was given the night off) helping Ellsworth yet again. On the 29 November episode of SmackDown Live, Ellsworth suffered a storyline injury after Styles interrupted his Ambrose Asylums segment with Ambrose, attacking both and delivering a Styles Clash to Ellsworth off the steel steps, which caused Ellsworth to be taken on a stretcher by medical personnel. This led Ellsworth interfering on December 4 at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs during the Tables, Ladders and Chairs between Styles and Ambrose to help the latter, but he ended up helping Styles instead by pushing Ambrose off the ladder and sent him through two tables, turning heel. Ellsworth explained that since he had already beaten Styles three times, he helped Styles because he wanted to defeat him again, this time for the WWE World Championship, a match SmackDowns commissioner Shane McMahon granted him for the following episode of SmackDown Live. Ellsworth also praised his own [...] "brilliant strategy" [...] to give Styles the title so his title match would be against Styles, who he had [...] "beaten three times already", adding that Ambrose would have [...] "done the same thing" [...] and would [...] "understand cause we go way back", also promising him an immediate shot at the title after he would defeat Styles, but Ambrose would instead end up giving him a Dirty Deeds. This prompted Ellsworth trying to make it up with Ambrose by helping him defeat The Miz for the Intercontinental Championship on the December 6 episode of SmackDown Live, but his effort backfired and eventually cost Ambrose the match. <b>Furthemore,</b> Ellsworths title opportunity was twice postponed, first due to Styles being legitimate injured, and the second time due to Ellsworth suffering from a kayfabe cold. The match eventually happened on the December 20 episode of SmackDown Live, during which Styles easily defeated Ellsworth in under a minute to end their storyline.|$|E
