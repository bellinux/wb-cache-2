5000|$|A {{second problem}} was that the {{multiple}} radio frequency stages, all tuned to the same frequency, were prone to oscillate, and the parasitic oscillations mixed with the radio station's carrier in the detector, producing audible <b>heterodynes</b> (<b>beat</b> notes), whistles and moans, in the speaker.

5000|$|A {{more serious}} {{drawback}} {{was that it}} could act as an inadvertent radio transmitter, producing interference (RFI) in nearby receivers. In AM reception, {{to get the most}} sensitivity the tube was operated very close to instability and could easily break into oscillation (and in CW reception did oscillate), and the resulting radio signal was radiated by its wire antenna. In nearby receivers, the regenerative's signal would beat with the signal of the station being received in the detector, creating annoying <b>heterodynes,</b> (<b>beats),</b> howls and whistles. [...] Early regeneratives which oscillated easily were called [...] "bloopers", and were made illegal in Europe.

5000|$|Another {{advantage}} of the circuit was that the tube {{could be made to}} oscillate, and thus a single tube could serve as both a beat frequency oscillator and a detector, functioning as a heterodyne receiver to make CW radiotelegraphy transmissions audible. [...] This mode was called an autodyne receiver. To receive radiotelegraphy, the feedback was increased until the tube oscillated, then the oscillation frequency was tuned {{to one side of the}} transmitted signal. The incoming radio carrier signal and local oscillation signal mixed in the tube and produced an audible <b>heterodyne</b> (<b>beat)</b> tone at the difference between the frequencies.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1915 the tikker was {{replaced}} by a better means of accomplishing the same thing; the [...] "heterodyne receiver" [...] invented by Reginald Fessenden in 1902. In this an electronic oscillator generated a radio signal at a frequency fo offset from the incoming radio wave carrier fC. This was applied to the rectifying detector with the radio carrier. In the detector the two signals mixed, creating a <b>heterodyne</b> (<b>beat)</b> signal at the difference fC - fC between these frequencies, which was in the audio frequency range. The heterodyne provided the audible tone in the earphone whenever the carrier was present. After vacuum tube oscillators were invented in 1913 by Alexander Meissner the heterodyne receiver replaced the tikker. Today the heterodyne method is still used to receive CW signals, and the beat frequency oscillator (BFO) is a standard part of all communications receivers.|$|E

5000|$|For the {{reception}} of CW radiotelegraphy (Morse code) signals, the feedback is increased {{to the level of}} oscillation (a loop gain of one), so that the amplifier functions as an oscillator (BFO) as well as an amplifier, generating a steady sine wave signal at the resonant frequency, as well as amplifying the incoming signal.

The two frequencies mix in the nonlinear amplifier, generating a <b>heterodyne</b> (<b>beat</b> frequency) signal at the difference between the two frequencies. This frequency is in the audio range, so it is heard as a steady tone in the receiver's speaker whenever the station's carrier is present.

50|$|The {{distance}} between the fuze and the target is not constant but rather constantly changing due to the high speed of the fuze and any motion of the target. When the {{distance between}} the fuze and the target changes rapidly, then the phase relationship also changes rapidly. The signals are in-phase one instant and out-of-phase a few hundred microseconds later. The result is a <b>heterodyne</b> <b>beat</b> frequency that indicates the velocity difference. Viewed another way, the received signal frequency is doppler shifted from the oscillator frequency by the relative motion of the fuze and target. Consequently, a low frequency signal corresponding to the frequency difference develops at the oscillator's plate terminal. Two additional amplifiers detected and filtered this low frequency signal. If the amplified beat frequency signal is large enough (indicating a nearby object), then it triggers the 4th tube (a gas-filled thyratron); the thyratron conducts a large current that sets off the electrical detonator.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the design}} of {{communication}} systems like radio on fibre, an important step is the characterisation of opto-microwave receivers. This paper presents two equipments based on the generation of millimetre-waves by the beating of lasers. The sources of the two benches are different. So the particularities of each {{of them will be}} showed. An example of application is given by the characterisation of an Heterojunction Photo Transistor (HPT). I. Overview of the techniques of microwave single-tone-signal transport by an optical carrier Different fibre optic communication systems imply components having to work at very high frequencies. It is the case, for instance, for long haul links or for on-chip optical connections with very high bit rates of tens of Gb/s. It is also the case for radio on fibre systems. In all these systems, optical detection components and associated circuits need to be characterised at microwave or millimetre wave frequencies. To realise this characterisation, it is necessary to set up opto-microwave systems which should be able to combine an optical carrier with a microwave signal. Microwave frequencies can go until 40 or 60 GHz. These frequencies can appear through three different schemes:- The laser source is directly modulated by a microwave frequency- The optical carrier is modulated by an external modulator like an electro-absorption or phase modulator- <b>Heterodyne</b> <b>beating</b> of two optical sources into a photodetector generates the microwav...|$|R

40|$|An {{apparatus}} of the <b>heterodyne</b> <b>beat</b> type for {{measurement of the}} dipole moment is described, which consists of a 1 Mc crystal-controlled oscillator, a variable oscillator of the Franklin type, and a mixer and beat indicator. The Franklin oscillator has excellent stability, the frequency variation being within 1 cps for about one hour. Since the singnals from the fixed and variable oscillators are pure sine, no spurious beat appears on the beat indicator. The dipole moments measured on nitrobenzene and chlorbenzenein benzene solutions give 3. 99 D and 1. 59 D respectively, being very consistent with the literature value.

5000|$|In a radio receiver, a beat {{frequency}} oscillator or BFO is a dedicated oscillator used to create an audio frequency signal from Morse code radiotelegraphy (CW) transmissions to make them audible.

BFOs are also used to demodulate single-sideband (SSB) signals, making them intelligible, by essentially restoring the carrier that was suppressed at the transmitter.

5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant <b>heterodyne</b> <b>beats</b> is measured.|$|R
