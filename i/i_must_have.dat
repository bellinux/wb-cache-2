500|$|Spector made various {{changes to}} the songs. His most {{dramatic}} embellishments occurred on 1 April 1970, the last ever Beatles recording session, when he added orchestral overdubs to [...] "The Long and Winding Road", [...] "Across the Universe" [...] and [...] "I Me Mine" [...] at Abbey Road Studios. The {{only member of the}} Beatles present was Starr, who played drums with the session musicians to create Spector's characteristic [...] "Wall of Sound". Already known for his eccentric behaviour in the studio, Spector was in a peculiar mood that day, according to balance engineer Peter Bown: [...] "He wanted tape echo on everything, he had to take a different pill every half hour and had his bodyguard with him constantly. He was on the point of throwing a wobbly, saying 'I want to hear this, I want to hear that. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> this, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> that.'" [...] The orchestra became so annoyed by Spector's behaviour that the musicians refused to play any further; at one point, Bown left for home, forcing Spector to telephone him and persuade him into coming back after Starr had told Spector to calm down.|$|E

500|$|On 2 October 1869, Putlibai {{gave birth}} to her last child, Mohandas, in a dark, {{windowless}} ground-floor room of the Gandhi family residence in Porbandar city. As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as [...] "restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears." [...] The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, he admits that they left an indelible impression on his mind. He writes: [...] "It haunted me and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> acted Harishchandra to myself times without number."

[...] Sara took her son on a Caribbean cruise in 1904, hoping that a separation would squelch the romance, but Franklin remained determined.

500|$|Hergé did {{not make}} use of speech bubbles to convey into the comic, an {{innovation}} that was yet to become widespread in Europe, and instead his captions were accompanied by captions of three to five lines long. He would begin to add simple speech bubbles into the series, stating simple comments like [...] "Eureka!", [...] "Bang!", and [...] "Hip! Hip! Hip! Hurrah!". Hergé later noted that [...] "From time to time... I risked a timid question mark, or perhaps a few stars, when, for example, a character was punched. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> seen that in L'Éatant or Les Belles Images, the illustrated papers of the time." [...] Hergé had come {{under the influence of}} other comic strips, such as those of the French author Alain Saint-Ogan, and British comic magazine The Rainbow. He was also influenced by the contemporary American comics that reporter Léon Degrelle had sent back to Belgium from Mexico, where he was stationed to report on the Cristero War. These American comics included George McManus's Bringing Up Father, George Herriman's Krazy Kat and Rudolph Dirks's Katzenjammer Kids.

500|$|I {{was visiting}} {{my friend and}} generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With {{characteristic}} kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (as I recall it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not on my list, mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once {{that there was an}} extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called [...] "possible" [...] values of the surface brightness and density. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: [...] "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study! ...|$|E
500|$|After Darius I of Persia (...) {{launched}} a military {{campaign against the}} Scythians in Europe in 513 BC, he left behind his general Megabazus to quell the Paeonians, Thracians, and coastal Greek city-states of the southern Balkans. In 512/511 BC Megabazus sent envoys demanding Macedonian submission as a vassal state to the Achaemenid Empire of ancient Persia, to which Amyntas I responded by formally accepting the hegemony of the Persian king of kings. This began the period of Achaemenid Macedonia, which lasted for roughly three decades. The Macedonian kingdom was largely autonomous and outside of Persian control, but was expected to provide troops and provisions for the Achaemenid army. Amyntas II, son of Amyntas I's daughter Gygaea of Macedon and her husband Bubares, son of Megabazus, was given the Phrygian city of Alabanda as an appanage by Xerxes I (...) , to secure the Persian-Macedonian marriage alliance. Persian authority over Macedonia was interrupted by the Ionian Revolt (499–493 BC), yet the Persian general Mardonius was able to subjugate Macedonia, bringing it under Persian rule. It is doubtful, though, that Macedonia was ever officially included within a Persian satrapy (i.e. province). The Macedonian king Alexander <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> viewed his subordination {{as an opportunity to}} aggrandize his own position, since he used Persian military support to extend his own borders. The Macedonians provided military aid to Xerxes I during the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 480–479 BC, which saw Macedonians and Persians fighting against a Greek coalition led by Athens and Sparta. Following the Greek victory at Salamis, the Persians sent Alexander I as an envoy to Athens, hoping to strike an alliance with their erstwhile foe, yet his diplomatic mission was rebuffed. Achaemenid control over Macedonia ceased when the Persians were ultimately defeated by the Greeks and fled the Greek mainland in Europe.|$|E
500|$|Dubbed at {{the time}} [...] "The Queen of obscene", Madonna and the Sex era is {{considered}} by many as the artist's most controversial and transgressive period. The book, widely panned by the press, is {{regarded as one of the}} factors that shaped the social reaction and critique towards Madonna during the early 1990s. Her fifth studio album Erotica was affected by the negative press surrounding the book. In March 1993, Spin magazine wrote an article praising the book, but months later in Mexico, social communicologist Nino Canún dedicated an episode of his morning talk show ¿Y usted qué opina? (English: So what's your opinion?), to Madonna. Some members of the audience, among them a priest, presented their arguments as to why [...] "this morally clueless singer shouldn't be allowed to perform in the country", making reference to The Girlie Show World Tour, which was set to visit Mexico. Later, during the concert, Madonna wore a charro sombrero and simulated an orgy with her dancers onstage, as a response to these comments. Continuing her provocative imagery, Madonna starred in the erotic thriller Body of Evidence, which featured the singer fully nude and in scenes engaged in simulated sexual acts. In March 1994, Madonna appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, using profanity that was required to be censored on television and handing Letterman a pair of her underwear and asking him to smell it. The releases of her sexually explicit film, album and book, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics regard Madonna as a sexual renegade. She faced strong negative publicity from critics and fans, who commented that [...] "she had gone too far" [...] and that her career was over. Later, on the song [...] "Human Nature", from her sixth studio album Bedtime Stories (1994), Madonna addressed the public backlash the book was still receiving, particularly with the lines [...] "Did I say something wrong? Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been crazy," [...] as well as the line [...] "What was I thinking?".|$|E
