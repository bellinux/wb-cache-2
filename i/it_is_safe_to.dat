5|$|In late 1938, another PanzerI {{was sent}} to the Armament Factory of Seville in order to mount a 45mm gun, {{captured}} from a Soviet tank (a T-26 or BT-5). A second was sent sometime later in order to exchange the original armament for a 37-millimeter Maklen anti-tank gun, which had been deployed to Asturias in late 1936 on the Soviet ship A. Andreiev. It remains unknown to what extent these trials and adaptations were completed, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> assume neither adaptation was successful beyond the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> {{observe the}} total {{phase of a}} solar eclipse {{directly}} only when the Sun's photosphere is completely covered by the Moon, and not before or after totality. During this period, the Sun is too dim to be seen through filters. The Sun's faint corona will be visible, and the chromosphere, solar prominences, and possibly even a solar flare may be seen. At the end of totality, the same effects will occur in reverse order, and {{on the opposite side}} of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The splendid artistic {{legacy of}} Angkor Wat and other Khmer monuments in the Angkor region led {{directly}} to France adopting Cambodia as a protectorate on 11 August 1863 and invading Siam {{to take control of}} the ruins. This quickly led to Cambodia reclaiming lands in the northwestern corner of the country that had been under Siamese (Thai) control since AD 1351 (Manich Jumsai 2001), or by some accounts, AD 1431. Cambodia gained independence from France on 9 November 1953 and has controlled Angkor Wat since that time. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> say that from the colonial period onwards until the site's nomination as UNESCO World Heritage in 1992, this specific temple of Angkor Wat was instrumental in the formation of the modern and gradually globalised concept of built cultural heritage.|$|E

5|$|There are {{different}} types of starts for races of different distances. Middle- and long-distance races mainly use the waterfall start. This is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves farther out at {{the outer edge of}} the track. Competitors are allowed to move towards the inside lane right away, as long as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> do so. For some middle-distance races, such as 800m, each athlete starts in their own lane. Once the gun fires, they must run in the lane they began in until markers on the track notify them it is time to move towards the inside lane. For sprint races, athletes begin in start blocks and must stay in their own lane for the entire race.|$|E

25|$|Technical dives may {{alternatively}} {{be defined}} as dives where the diver cannot safely ascend directly to the surface either due to a mandatory decompression stop or a physical ceiling. This form of diving implies a much larger reliance on redundancy of critical equipment and procedural training since the diver must stay underwater until <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> ascend or the diver has successfully exited the overhead environment.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately for Ismail, {{most of his}} {{subjects}} were Sunni. He thus had to enforce official Shiism violently, putting to death those who opposed him. Under this pressure, Safavid subjects either converted or pretended to convert, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> say {{that the majority of}} the population was probably genuinely Shia by the end of the Safavid period in the 18th century, and most Iranians today are Shia, although there is still a Sunni minority.|$|E
