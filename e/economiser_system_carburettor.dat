40|$|In Malaysia, {{interest}} on motorcycles {{as the main}} choice of transport for works has increased recently, mainly due to the increasing fuel price. The majority of the motorcycles, especially those with cubic capacity less than 250 cc, are equipped with the conventional <b>carburettor</b> <b>system.</b> Small gasoline fuelled engines operating using <b>carburettor</b> <b>system,</b> however, suffers from low operating efficiency, apart from producing hazardous emissions to the environment. In light of this situation, the current project will attempt to develop a retrofit fuel injection kit to address such challenges of meeting power requirement as a small cubic capacity prime mover and also in complying with the emissions regulations currently put in place. The experimental works on the proposed fuel injection retrofit kit is initiated by preparing a dedicated engine test rig equipped with the necessary instrumentation, which will allow analysis on the engine operating performance. Among the parameters to be investigated are engine torque, brake power, specific fuel consumption and engine thermal efficiency. Throughout the work, other key operating parameters that will also be monitored are the emissions levels of the exhaust gas and operating consistency and durability.

5000|$|The {{race was}} {{extended}} from 500 miles to 1000 kilometres in 1973. The increased {{pace of the}} cars had resulted in the 500 mile race distance being achieved earlier each year, and since Australia had converted to the metric system the increased distance was considered more appropriate than 800 km for an endurance race. To reduce the threat to public safety, homologation rules were relaxed to permit certain modifications to the race cars. Ostensibly this removed the need to build batches of high speed road cars and improved the durability of the actual race cars. The Group E Series Production Touring Car regulations, which had applied to the 1972 race, were replaced by the new Group C Touring Car regulations for 1973. [...] Upgrades were allowed to seats, lubrication <b>systems,</b> camshafts, <b>carburettors,</b> suspensions, brakes and wheel rim sizes. These changes advantaged the better resourced teams as {{a great deal of}} testing was now needed to optimize the performance of the race cars. Factory teams had the best access to improved components that were often not readily available to private competitors.|$|R

It adopted some of the L2 features, having twin exhaust and inlet valves in each cylinderdriven by an overhead camshaft, twin spark plugs and twin magnetos. The splash component of the L2's lubrication was abandoned in favour of a completely forced recirculating <b>system.</b> The twin <b>carburettors</b> of the L2 were replaced with a single float chamber, dual-venturi model.

A 2.0-litre petrol engine from the Rover stable was briefly available in a model known as the 2.0-litre Mpi I4. This was intended to attract fleet managers, since UK (and Italian) tax laws benefited vehicles under 2.0 litres.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{documents the}} selection of the engine for Formula SAE car. This dissertation also documents the design and testing of the intake manifold, exhaust <b>system,</b> <b>carburettor</b> and the intake restrictor for the USQ Motorsport Formula SAE engine. Before selecting the engine thorough research into all types of engines and designs was carried out. Once the type of engine that was suitable for the Formula SAE competition was determined, all of the parameters that impacted on {{the selection of}} the engine were analysed. To accurately predict which engine was the 'optimum engine' a model of the Formula SAE car's acceleration performance was created and the calculations were undertaken using Matlab. The engine that was purchased for the Formula SAE car was sourced from a 600 cc water-cooled motorcycle. Once the engine had been purchased it was possible to design the fuelling system for the Formula SAE car. In this project the fuelling system incorporated the method of aspiration, fuel mixture preparation system, the intake manifold, the intake restrictor and the exhaust system. A feasibility study that encompassed forced air induction systems for the Formula SAE car was carried out and the utilisation of multi-point fuel injection was also examined. However due to budgetary restraints neither of these systems were feasible. Therefore it was decided that the engine would be naturally aspirated and carburetted. The merits of fixed venturi carburettors and constant velocity carburettors were explored in order to select the most suitable type of carburettor for the Formula SAE engine. Research was carried out in order to find the intake manifold configuration that best suited the Formula SAE car. The USQ workshop was also liased with during the initial design period {{in order to ensure that}} the machining capabilities at the USQ could produce the required design. In order to determine if the final design of the intake manifold was feasible a prototype manifold was constructed. In order to design the restrictor various standards that are used to design flow measurement devices were incorporated. Several prototype restrictors were constructed and tested using an airflow bench. The design of the exhaust system was also investigated. It was found that the best solution in regards to the exhaust system was to retain the original exhaust manifold and purchase an aftermarket muffler. As the project developed it became clear that cooling requirements of the engine were a concern. For this reason experimental procedures were devised to determine if the original motorcycle radiator would be sufficient. Because all of the components that were designed or specified in this project are part of a system they were tested together, on the engine. Unfortunately it was not possible to obtain any meaningful test results. The reason for this was that the rest of the car was not at a stage of completion that would allow testing on dynamometer. For this reason, at the time of writing, it is uncertain whether the systems that were designed in this project matches the design criteria, which are outlined in chapter 2...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{expansion}} (DX) refrigeration {{technology is}} almost exclusively used in multi-temperature transport refrigeration systems. Multi-temperature systems use {{up to three}} evaporators, requiring large refrigerant charges and system pressure control to operate {{over a wide range}} of set-point conditions. Despite incremental design improvements over the past decade, environmental and control issues continue to arise with DX systems. Deployment of indirect refrigeration systems (IDX) offers an alternative approach to address these issues. Indirect systems can however suffer from performance penalties, where reduced cooling capacity and COP occur under certain operating conditions. One strategy, aimed at offsetting the disadvantage of reduced refrigeration capacity, is to incorporate an economiser circuit into the primary cycle of the IDX <b>system.</b> <b>Economiser</b> cycles can enhance the refrigeration effect of the primary refrigerant in the primary to secondary heat exchanger of the indirect system. In this paper, for a multi-temperature transport refrigeration system, the performance of an optimised economised indirect system is compared with a non-economised indirect system and a contemporary direct expansion system. All tests for the economised IDX system were carried out using optimised refrigerant mass flowrate injection ratios, which were established for different operating boundary conditions. Tests were carried out to ATP standard for a Class C multi-compartment vehicle for a range of set point temperatures from - 20 ºC to + 10 ºC...|$|R
40|$|Indoor {{air quality}} (IAQ) has {{recently}} received increased attention by researchers, architect developers {{and public health}} officials. The human exposure {{to a variety of}} indoor pollutants and the high cost of energy are the motivation for these kinds of studies. Fungus and mould growth has always been a problem in subtropical climate areas due to the high temperature and high humidity. Generally in institutional buildings, most of the internal heat load is generated by human body and thermal comfort is achieved with extensive usage of recycled air and air conditioning. The main considerations in any air conditioning <b>system</b> <b>economisers</b> are based on the usage of recycled air and air ventilation. The current practice in an institutional building cooling system under subtropical climate is to curb the mould issue by overcooling large recirculation airflow to remove the moisture content from the air, which is considered as an expensive practice. The use of a solar desiccant cooling system to reduce moisture from the air and to improve indoor air quality is found to be economical, environmental friendly and readily achievable in the tropics. This technology is the future alternative to the conventional vapour compression cooling system to maintain human thermal comfort conditions and enhance indoor air quality. Solar desiccant cooling systems are also environmentally friendly and energy efficient. This paper presents review on a solar desiccant cooling system and its affect on indoor air quality. It first introduces the issue of air moisture, mould growth and indoor air quality and then the development and application of thermally activated desiccant cooling technologies...|$|R

[...] The AN.1 {{was their first}} foray into Diesel aero-engines. To shorten its development time and {{to concentrate on the}} higher combustion chamber pressures, different burning temperatures and fuel supply systems of the Diesel cycle, they based its design on the Fiat A.12. [...] This was a petrol engine first run in 1916 and produced in large numbers during World War I, a water-cooled, upright, overhead camshaft straight six. The AN.1 kept the external dimensions and the lower section, crankshaft, crankcase, sump, plus the lubrication and water-cooling supplies of the older engine but required new cylinders, pistons, valve gear and fuel delivery <b>systems</b> to replace <b>carburettors</b> and magnetos. The cylinder barrels had to be stronger to withstand the greater combustion pressures (2-300 atmospheres) required by the compression ignition Diesel. The swept volume of the Diesel engine was reduced by 23.4% as the cylinders had a bore of 140mm (5.51in), compared with the A.12's 160mm (6.30in). Two camshafts were fitted to operate the four valves per cylinder, though they were driven via the same tall vertical rod used for the single camshaft of the A.12, at its top, and the water pump of both models at its bottom.|$|R
40|$|Carburetted 2 -stroke {{engines are}} a {{worldwide}} pandemic. There are over 50 million 2 -stroke cycle engines in Asia alone, powering motorbikes, mopeds, “three-wheelers”, “auto-rickshaws”, “tuk-tuks”, and “tricycles”. These carbureted 2 -stroke engines {{are characterized by}} high levels of hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM) emissions. Direct injection is a technology that has shown a great ability to reduce these emissions {{while at the same}} time improve fuel economy. A prototype kit has been designed for use in retrofitting existing carbureted two-stroke engines to direct injection. The kit was designed for use on a TVS 50; a motorcycle from the INDIA that is commonly used as a transportation. It is however, a relatively common engine design and TVS manufactures similar models for sale all over the world. The conventional fuel injection system kit incorporates the Orbital air blast direct injection system. This injection system has been implemented in TVS 50. The design involved replacing the existing cylinder head with one designed to incorporate the direct injection valves as well as a modified combustion chamber. An external compressor was added to supply compressed air to the <b>system.</b> The <b>carburettor</b> was refined with a throttle body outfitted with a position indicator, and an encoder system was added to provide speed and position feedback to the engine control unit (ECU). Once design and manufacture of the system was complete, it was installed on the motorcycle. The motorcycle was then mounted in a low inertia eddy current dynamometer test cell for calibration. Calibration was done on the dynamometer for power and engine performance. The system was also tuned in real world road tests for drivability. When calibrations were complete emissions and fuel consumption measurements were taken for the vehicle. The results showed an 88 % reduction in hydrocarbon emissions and a 72 % reduction in carbon monoxide emissions versus the baseline engine, {{while at the same time}} virtually eliminating visible smoke.

40|$|Refrigerant leakage {{associated}} with multi-temperature direct expansion (DX) systems in transport refrigeration applications has {{lead to increased}} interest in alternative refrigeration concepts. One alternative design approach aimed at reducing refrigerant charge and simplifying system control, {{involves the use of}} an indirect (IDX) refrigeration circuit. Recent investigations, concerned with the deployment of indirect systems for supermarket applications have shown that penalties in cooling capacity and COP can exist under certain operating conditions. These performance deficiencies are attributed to a number of factors including: additional power requirements of secondary circulation pumps, temperature glide {{associated with}} the secondary working fluid, and increased compressor pressure lift due to the additional primary to secondary heat exchanger. One design strategy, aimed at offsetting the disadvantage of reduced refrigeration capacity is to incorporate an economiser circuit into the primary cycle of the IDX <b>system.</b> <b>Economiser</b> cycles can enhance the refrigeration effect of the primary refrigerant in the primary to secondary heat exchanger of the indirect system. The net effect can result in increased refrigeration capacity, if appropriate mass flowrates of refrigerant are expanded through the economiser circuit. However, to date, there is little evidence of the use of an economiser cycle in more complex refrigeration systems, such as multi temperature transport systems, which are subject to significant variation in boundary conditions and operate frequently under transient conditions. This paper examines for a multi-temperature indirect transport refrigeration system, the influence of injection ratio on system performance under ATP conditions as well as the sensitivity of system parameters to different injection ratios. It is found that system capacity and COP can be modulated by regulation of injection ratio. An optimum injection ratio exists which allows maximisation of system capacity and COP respectively. This optimum injection ratio appears to be dependent on set-point and ambient conditions...|$|R
