5|$|Cattle <b>grazing</b> in the Trout Creek Mountains {{began in}} the late 19thcentury, and the BLM {{currently}} oversees <b>grazing</b> allotments in the area. Cattle can be found <b>grazing</b> in some areas during the spring and summer months. The effects of <b>grazing</b> on the local environment were the subject of controversy in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are largely}} <b>grazing</b> herbivores, unlike {{browsing}} {{animals such as}} goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants {{very close to the}} ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle. For this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational <b>grazing,</b> where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover. Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy spurge, kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush, making <b>grazing</b> sheep effective for conservation <b>grazing.</b> Research conducted in Imperial County, California compared lamb <b>grazing</b> with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields. Three trials demonstrated that <b>grazing</b> lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. Entomologists also compared <b>grazing</b> lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa. In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the course of rearing Red Pied heifers reared with use of <b>graze</b> and stable and review effect of <b>graze</b> use on subsequence performance in 1 st lactation. In selected breed was monitored process of heifer grow by periodical weighting in three months interval, furthermore was taken for these heifers these reproduction indices: 1 st insemination age, insemination index, 1 st calve age. Heifers are divided by rearing form (<b>graze,</b> stable) and compared differences in grow intesities and reproduction efficiency between particular groups. Subsequently, for cows on first lactation were monitored and compared these indices: level of milk performance, content of milk elements, degree of physical condition, indices of fertility. Dairy cows are divided into groups according to how they were reared as heifers (<b>graze,</b> stable). When comparing growth of heifers, <b>grazed</b> heifers reaches higher values than group of not <b>grazed</b> heifers. <b>Grazed</b> heifers grows more quickly: at age 3 months was their average weight 93, 26 Kg against 88, 30 Kg not <b>grazed</b> heifers. At age 6 months was weight of <b>grazed</b> heifers 169, 51 kg against 161, 80 kg not <b>grazed</b> heifers, At age 9 months was values 236, 47 kg for <b>grazed</b> heifers, 228, 07 kg for not <b>grazed</b> heifers, at age 12 months 326, 62 kg and 299, 87 kg, at age 15 months 366, 11 kg and 359, 98 kg. From reproduction indices have been found statistically significant differences in age at 1 st insemination, when the <b>grazed</b> heifers were flushed in average age of 18, 43 months against not <b>grazed</b> heifers in age of 17, 12 months. In addition, was found statistically significant differences in age at first calving, when the values obtained for the group of <b>grazed</b> heifers was 28. 63 months and for not <b>grazed</b> heifers 27, 73 months. First calving heifers reared on <b>graze</b> produce in lactation average 7 782, 4 Kg of milk, first calving heifers reared in stable produce in lactation average 7 064, 40 Kg of milk. Differences was statistically significant. Average duration of lactation at first calving heifers reared on <b>graze</b> was 359, 47 days, duration of lactation at first calving heifers reared in stable was 329, 01 days. Differences was statistically highly significant. From the linear description is clear that <b>graze</b> has positive effect on heifers muscling and limbs. In overall assessment made <b>grazed</b> heifers higher rating points 81, 43 for heifers reared on <b>graze</b> and 81, 00 point for heifers reared in stable. These differences could not be statistically demonstrated...|$|R
30|$|Interestingly, {{we found}} a strong pasture effect in the lightly <b>grazed</b> treatments, {{including}} the ungrazed exclosures, which are located within the lightly <b>grazed</b> pastures. We did not find {{a difference between the}} heavily <b>grazed</b> pastures. This suggests that our two heavily <b>grazed</b> pastures were more similar than our lightly <b>grazed</b> pastures due possibly to higher stocking densities and more uniform vegetation removal or to original soil properties, initial vegetation composition or slope and aspect which can affect inherent soil water properties.|$|R

5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1970s, the Bureau of Land Management {{identified}} damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas. Approximately 20,000 willow trees were planted along streams, small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams, and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from <b>grazing.</b> Next, the agency sought to reform land-use plans to change <b>grazing</b> practices, which became a complex and controversial project.|$|E
