25|$|Trace {{amounts of}} {{explosive}} residue were detected on three samples of material from three separate {{locations of the}} recovered airplane wreckage (described by the FBI {{as a piece of}} canvas-like material and two pieces of a <b>floor</b> <b>panel).</b> These samples were submitted to the FBI's laboratory in Washington, D.C., which determined that one sample contained traces of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), another nitroglycerin, and the third a combination of RDX and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN); these findings received much media attention at the time. In addition, the backs of several damaged passenger seats were observed to have an unknown red/brown-shaded substance on them. According to the seat manufacturer, the locations and appearance of this substance were consistent with adhesive used {{in the construction of the}} seats, and additional laboratory testing by NASA identified the substance as being consistent with adhesives.|$|E

2500|$|While {{being tested}} for {{competing}} British television programme Top Gear, first broadcast on 11 November 2007, a <b>floor</b> <b>panel</b> came {{loose from the}} test vehicle as it was being driven at speed by Jeremy Clarkson, after he had already made a play of being scared about driving the car because of Plato's experience.

2500|$|Some older {{low-cost}} {{structures are}} elevated on tapered concrete pylons set into shallow pits, a method frequently used to attach outdoor decks to existing buildings. This {{is seen in}} conditions of damp soil, [...] especially in tropical conditions, as it leaves a dry ventilated space under the house, and in far northern conditions of permafrost (frozen mud) as it keeps the building's warmth from destabilizing the ground beneath. During an earthquake, the pylons may tip, spilling the building to the ground. This can be overcome by using deep-bored holes to contain cast-in-place reinforced pylons, which are then secured to the <b>floor</b> <b>panel</b> {{at the corners of}} the building. Another technique is to add sufficient diagonal bracing or sections of concrete shear wall between pylons.|$|E

2500|$|The forward {{cargo hold}} had been loaded with [...] {{capacity}} baggage containers, made either of fiberglass or aluminium, {{and filled with}} suitcases. After the explosion, most of these containers showed damage consistent with a fall from , but two of them—metal container AVE4041 and fibre container AVN7511—showed unusual damage. From the loading plan, investigators saw that AVE4041 had been situated inboard of, and slightly above, the starburst-patterned hole in the fuselage, with AVN7511 right next to it. The reconstruction of container AVE4041 showed blackening, pitting, and severe damage to the <b>floor</b> <b>panel</b> and other areas, indicating that what the investigators called a [...] "high-energy event" [...] had taken place inside it. Though {{the floor of the}} container was damaged, there was no blackening or pitting of it. From this, and the distribution of sooting and pitting elsewhere, investigators calculated that the suitcase containing the bomb had not rested on the floor, but had probably been on top of another case, though there was no proof that the explosion had occurred in a suitcase.|$|E

40|$|Black liquor {{recovery}} boiler <b>floor</b> <b>panels</b> made of composite tubes with alloy 625 applied by weld overlay process on SA 210 carbon steel {{have been studied}} using finite element modeling to determine the stresses under different operating conditions. Heat treatment of tubes after weld overlay process is shown to be beneficial, since tubes develop a compressive axial stress at the tube fireside crown after welding with membrane to make the <b>floor</b> <b>panels.</b> A localized temperature excursion at the tube crown can cause the axial stress to become tensile, although cracks forming on the fireside surface would still stop before reaching the tube inside surface. Tensile axial stress in the membrane may cause cracks that have formed on the top surface to proceed past the interface through the carbon steel. Heat treatment of the <b>floor</b> <b>panels</b> {{can be used to}} reduce the stress magnitude in the membrane, and could prevent cracks from progressing into the carbon steel...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from October 13, 2016 - October 13, 2017 This project determines the short term and long term effective stiffness values for Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) with a reinforced concrete topping. The reinforced concrete {{was attached to the}} CLT panels with interface connections, and different types of interface connections were tested. Throughout this project, there are 31 tests with composite CLT <b>floor</b> <b>panels.</b> Described in this report are: • Eight 2 ft. by 10 ft. 8 inch composite <b>floor</b> <b>panels</b> with different interface shear connections. All these 2 ft. by 10 ft. 8 inch panels were tested to failure in positive bending moment under simply-supported conditions. • Three 8 ft. by 8 ft. composite <b>floor</b> <b>panels</b> with inclined self-tapping screws. The panels were tested to estimate the initial stiffness in strong and weak axis bending, under positive and negative bending moments. In addition, two-way bending flexural (warping) stiffness values were obtained from testing results. Lastly, the <b>floor</b> <b>panels</b> were tested to failure under weak-axis direction, positive moment bending, and in strong and weak axis bending under negative moment bending. • One 37. 5 ft. long by 8 ft. test specimen with inclined self-tapping screws was tested to failure. • One 20 ft. by 4 ft. specimen and one 13. 5 ft. by 4 ft. specimen under positive and negative bending moment, respectively, tested under creep loading. These tests aided in the determination of effective stiffness values {{that can be used for}} design of <b>floor</b> <b>panels</b> that have a total thickness of 9 inches, including a 2 - 1 / 4 inch concrete lamina, over a five-ply CLT panel. In addition, estimates of failure loads and moments presented in this thesis provide information needed for future structural designs of the CLT concrete composite floor systems...|$|R
