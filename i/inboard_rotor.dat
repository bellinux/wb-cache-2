40|$|An {{investigation}} {{to determine the}} altitude performance of the J 57 -P- 1 turbojet engine and components was conducted at the NACA Lewis altitude wind tunnel. Data were obtained over a corrected <b>inboard</b> <b>rotor</b> speed range from 56 to 106 percent of rated speed, with intercompressor bleeds both open and closed, at altitudes from 15, 000 to 50, 000 feet and at a flight Mach number of 0. 81. The corresponding range of Reynolds number indices was from 0. 858 to 0. 213. All data presented were obtained with a fixed-area exhaust nozzle sized according to the manufacturer's specification. Over-all engine performance parameters are presented as functions of <b>inboard</b> <b>rotor</b> speed corrected {{on the basis of}} engine inlet temperature. Component parameters are presented as functions of their respective corrected rotor speeds. A tabulation of all performance data is included in addition to the graphical presentation. Corrected net thrust is unusually sensitive to changes in corrected <b>inboard</b> <b>rotor</b> speed in the high speed region. A change of 1 percent in speed, at sated speed, produced a change of 6 percent in corrected net thrust. At rated engine speed, increasing the altitude from 15, 000 to 50, 000 feet at a constant flight Mach number of 0. 81 increased the specific fuel consumption 13 percent but did not affect corrected net thrust...|$|E
40|$|A {{drive system}} for a {{variable}} diameter rotor (VDR) system includes a plurality of rotor blade assemblies with inner and outer rotor blade segments. The outer blade segment being telescopically mounted to the inner blade segment. The VDR retraction/extension system includes a drive housing mounted {{at the root of}} each blade. The housing supports a spool assembly, a harmonic gear set and an electric motor. The spool assembly includes a pair of counter rotating spools each of which drive a respective cable which extends through the interior of the <b>inboard</b> <b>rotor</b> blade section and around a pulley mounted to the outboard rotor blade section. In operation, the electric motor drives the harmonic gear set which rotates the counter rotating spools. Rotation of the spools causes the cables to be wound onto or off their respective spool consequently effecting retraction/extension of the pulley and the attached outboard rotor blade section relative the <b>inboard</b> <b>rotor</b> blade section. As each blade drive system is independently driven by a separate electrical motor, each independent VDR blade assembly is independently positionable...|$|E

40|$|A {{brake disc}} plays an {{important}} role in the automotive industry since it concerns directly with safety. In order to develop proper heat ventilation a wide range of brake discs have been designed. Different types of physical brake disc geometries, as front- and back-vented brake discs, affect the heat ventilation directly. This is a vital factor of the brakeâ€™s capability. We recognized the importance of this circumstance and therefore attempted to create a test to investigate the temperature gradient of the brake disc in order to evaluate the coefficients of heat convection. The coefficients were modified by the change of temperature distribution in both brake discs under the forced heat convection in steady state conditions. However, the heat radiation value does not take into account that the heat convection is dominated by the physical geometry of the brake disc. To set up the experimental test for investigating the heat transfer by convection the JASO C 406 standard is adopted. The experimental results in terms of heat convection coefficients are used in the numerical simulation via the finite element method in order to study the temperature diffusion and heat ventilation of front and back-vented brake discs. Conse-quently, the experimental results reveal that the overall heat convection coefficients of the front-vented brake disc are higher than these of the back-vented one. In other words the simulation yields that the front-vented brake disc allows stronger heat ventilation than its compared object, leading to larger temperature differences between outboard and <b>inboard</b> <b>rotors,</b> resulting in more thermal stress. This makes it more susceptible to be damaged during operation. ...|$|R
50|$|First time {{an entirely}} new car was {{designed}} and fabricated from scratch at Rutgers in a school year. The car earned a spot in design semi finals. Utilized a 600CC Honda F3 motor. First time a motor was semi stressed in this program. Incorporated outboard shocks, {{which seemed to be}} going a step back, but they worked quite well. CV joints were applied after a long hiatus since the first car. Switched to a single <b>inboard</b> rear brake <b>rotor.</b> All three aluminum brake rotors failed during the morning heat of endurance. New rotors were made by the afternoon, but the car ultimately did not finish endurance due to a throttle control issue (jam nut came loose).|$|R
40|$|Rotational {{effects are}} known to {{influence}} severely the aerodynamic performance of the <b>inboard</b> region of <b>rotor</b> blades. The underlying physical mechanisms are however far from being well understood. The present work addresses this problem using Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes computations and experimental results of the MEXICO (Model Experiments in Controlled Conditions) rotor. Four axisymmetric inflow cases with wind speeds ranging from pre-stall to post-stall conditions are computed and compared with pressure and particle image velocimetry (PIV) experimental data, obtaining, in general, consistent results. At low angles of attack, the aerodynamic behavior {{of all of the}} studied blade sections resembles the one from the corresponding 2 D airfoils. However, at high angles of attack, rotational effects lead to stall delay and/or lift enhancement at inboard positions. Such effects are shown to occur only in the presence of significant radial flows. Interestingly, the way in which rotational effects influence the aerodynamics of the MEXICO blades differs qualitatively in certain aspects from the descriptions found in the literature about this topic. The presented results provide new insights that are useful for the development of advanced and physically-sound correction models...|$|R
