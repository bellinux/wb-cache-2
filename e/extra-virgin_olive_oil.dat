40|$|Pigments are {{responsible}} for the color of <b>olive</b> <b>oils,</b> and are an important ingredient that {{is directly related to the}} quality of this food. However, the concentration of pigments can vary significantly depending on the climate conditions, harvesting time, and olive cultivars. In this work, we quantified the main pigments in several <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> produced from a blend of three cultivars (Moraiolo, Frantoio, and Leccino) typical of Tuscany (Italy) harvested in three different years: 2012, 2013, and 2014. Pigments—namely, β-carotene, lutein, pheophytin A, and pheophytin B—were quantified by a method based on the mathematical analysis of the near ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of the oils. Data were analyzed by a multivariate statistical approach. The results show that the pigments’ content of <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> produced in 2014 can be well distinguished with respect to previous years. This can be explained by the anomalous climate conditions, which strongly affected Italy and, in particular, Tuscany, where the olives were harvested. This study represents an interesting example of how pigment content can be significant in characterizing <b>olive</b> <b>oils.</b> Moreover, this is the first report of pigment quantification in <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> produced in Tuscany...|$|R

In order to investigate the effects of the characteristics of the oil blends {{on the quality of the}} deriving flavoured <b>oils,</b> three mono-cultivar <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> (Coratina, Peranzana, Ogliarola) were used to produce three blends, which were successively flavoured by infusion. From each blend, three types of flavoured <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> were produced: basil, chilli pepper, and garlicÂ +Â chilli pepper. Mono-varietal <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils,</b> blends, and flavoured oils were submitted for routine analyses and for determination of polar compounds, phenolic profile, antioxidant activity, and volatile profiles. The panel and consumer tests were also carried out on the flavoured oils. Along with the undoubted influence of the flavouring agents, the quality parameters of each blend changed and their changes greatly depend on the starting blend. The parameters mostly affected by oil blend were: acidity, K 232, peroxide values, diacylglycerols, polar compounds, total phenolics, antioxidant activity, and phenolics such as p-coumaric acid, tyrosol acetate, vanillic acid, tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, hydroxytyrosol acetate, dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to tyrosol, and ligstroside aglycone, oleuropein aglycone. The effects of oil blending were rather limited on volatile profiles and sensory characteristics...|$|R

A total of 40 volatile compounds belonging mainly to esters, aldehydes, ketones, aliphatic alcohols and hydrocarbons were determined. Significant differences in the proportions of volatile and phenolic constituents of oils from different geographical origins were observed. The major volatile component was the C 6 aldehyde (hexanal and (E) - 2 -hexenal) fraction, whose content was highly variable between the areas studied. The content of (E) - 2 -hexenal ranged from 50. 9 % in the Melloulech EVOO to approximately 39. 8 % for El-Ala EVOO...|$|R

Using spectral data, principal component analysis successfully classified each cultivar and differentiated the mixtures from pure mono-varietal oils. Quantification of two different monovarietal oil mixtures (2 - 20 %) is achieved using partial least square (PLS) regression models. Correlation coefficients (R 2) of the proposed PLS regression models are 0. 94 and 0. 96 for the Erkence-Nizip and Ayvalik-Nizip mixtures, respectively. Cross-validation was applied to check the goodness of fit for the PLS regression models, and R 2 of the cross-validation was determined as 0. 84 and 0. 91, respectively, for the two mixtures.

40|$|A {{number of}} <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> were {{obtained}} by mechanical extractions from different Sicilian olive cultivars. High field NMR analyses showed, as expected, that the major components of the extra-virgin oils were triglycerides. The measurements of the proton longitudinal relaxation times (T 1) revealed that triglycerides were ellipsoidal-shaped. In fact, a multi-exponential mathematical model was applied to fit all the decay data from the classical inversion recovery experiments, thereby leading {{to the conclusion that}} anisotropic relaxation mechanisms arise into the triglycerides. Low field NMR experiments revealed two different components of the longitudinal relaxation times. The shortest T 1 value was attributed to an intra-molecular spin diffusion, whereas the longest T 1 was assigned to inter-molecular spin diffusion mechanisms. According to such hypothesis, it has been concluded that triglycerides in <b>extra-virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> are assembled in contiguous supramolecular blocks. The present study showed {{for the first time that}} the combined use of different NMR techniques can be very helpful for obtaining information on the conformational assessment of natural systems such as extra-virgin oils.
