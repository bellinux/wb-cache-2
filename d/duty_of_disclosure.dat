40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} scope of physicians' legal and ethical <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> in an era marred by {{decreasing}} available medical resources. Using three hypothetical case scenarios, it examines {{the scope of}} physicians' obligations to disclose information about medical interventions that patients might wish to consider but that are not available in their immediate community. The legal analyses focus on Canadian and Quebec law. Discussion of the ethical considerations centres {{on the concept of}} 'benefit' and issues of 'communication' and 'trust' in the physician-patient relationship. It integrates, as well, empirical knowledge about patients' desire for information and participation in decision-making. The thesis demonstrates the broad scope of the legal and ethical disclosure obligations that physicians owe patients, regardless of conditions of economic scarcity. It further highlights areas where law and ethics would suggest different conclusions with respect to disclosure obligations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{highlight}} the early modern scholastic contribution {{to dealing with the}} issue <b>of</b> pre-contractual <b>duties</b> to inform. Bringing together different strands of thought, ranging from Aristotelian philosophy to Roman law, the 16 th and 17 th century scholastics developed adequate analytical tools to solve legal and moral problems arising from information disparities between contracting parties. While first looking at the different classical and medieval texts that shaped the early modern debate, this paper then goes on to give a systematic account of how the early modern scholastics dealt with <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> about both intrinsic and extrinsic defects in the merchandise. A final chapter looks at how the early modern scholastic debate was received in the Northern natural law school, before concluding that the early modern scholastics took a surprisingly negative attitude towards duties to inform. © 2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden...|$|R

40|$|Many {{lawyers are}} now {{involved}} in mediation, {{either as a}} mediator or as a legal representative {{for one of the}} parties to the mediation. These roles raise a host of new ethical dilemmas for lawyers. The focus of the literature to date concerns the ethical complexities faced by mediators. Comparatively little attention has been given to the ethical position of legal representatives. This paper identifies some common ethical issues which arise in mediation from the perspective of legal representatives for the parties. It focuses on the issue <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> information (an issue which itself raises questions about honesty as against misrepresentation and openness or candour as against nondisclosure) and suggests how the issue might be resolved using the current rules of professional conduct governing lawyers in two common law jurisdictions, those of Australia and the United States. Each jurisdiction has taken a different approach on the issue. In the US, legal representatives owe mediators the same <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> as they owe to their opponents. In Australia, it seems that legal representatives may owe mediators the same duties as they owe to the judges. This paper will argue that the approach taken in the US (based on the much criticized rule 4. 1 of the American Bar Association Model Rules) is to be preferred...|$|R

40|$|This article {{highlights}} the ethically uncertain and emotionally charged climate that governs the criminalization of HIV nondisclosure in Canada. Focusing on AIDS Service Organizations (ASO), {{we suggest that}} interlocutors perform critical work that helps people living with HIV/AIDS {{make sense of their}} rights and responsibilities. Semi-structured interviews with 62 ASO staff across Canada revealed this shifting landscape of HIV advocacy in the age of criminalizing HIV nondisclosure. Drawing on a critical bioethics approach that is informed by considering the role of emotion in decision-making, this article critiques the liberal model of the rational actor that is central to traditional discussions of bioethics and law. Our findings suggest that ASO workers have varying degrees of knowledge about the intricacies <b>of</b> legal <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>disclosure,</b> which affect how they balance their own emotions and thoughts about nondisclosure with their professional duties to provide support and counselling. Ultimately, we argue that critical bioethics in the context of criminalization commands us to appreciate the inherently affective nature of the environment in which bioethical decisions are made...|$|R
40|$|The present article {{analyzes}} the recent {{revision of the}} International Bar Association Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration, which were approved by the IBA in late October 2014. First introduced in 2004, the guidelines have become an essential tool relied upon by arbitration practitioners, institutions and courts when assessing questions of impartiality and independence of arbitrators and the extent <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> requirements. The goal {{of this paper is}} not only to highlight those aspects of the revised guidelines which are new or clarified, but also to provide a comprehensive analysis of the guidelines as a whole. To that end, the authors have identified a number of key topic areas relating to conflicts of interest in arbitration which {{have been the subject of}} recurring debate and were also to a considerable extent at the core of the discussion during the revision process. These topic areas serve as a framework to analyze and better comprehend the impact of the various provisions of the guidelines. In particular, the article addresses in detail the following specific subject matters: <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> and enquiry for arbitrators, administrative secretaries and parties, relationship-based conflicts (including third-party funding), issue conflicts, and waivers of conflicts of interest (including advance waivers) ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{identifies}} the underlying values of German and English contract law. It establishes {{that to some}} extent almost all values are reflected in both jurisdictions but {{that in many cases}} the underlying values compete with each other. The thesis {{identifies the}} balance of the values in the context of four problem areas namely pre-contractual <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>disclosure</b> (breaking off negotiations), mistake, unfair contract terms and changed circumstances. The thesis concludes that although almost all values are reflected in each system the balance of the values differs significantly. This is important and topical because identifying the balance of the competing values within a jurisdictions and contrasting these to another jurisdiction provides a deeper level of understanding of the courts' decision-making process. The particular questions which the research addresses are twofold, firstly, which values are competing {{within the context of a}} particular problem, and secondly, what weight is given to each value in a given context in contrast to the other jurisdiction. In order to address these questions a combination of doctrinal and comparative research methods is adopted. The focus is on the decisions of the respective courts', but doctrinal elements are also explored through the way in which cases were interpreted by academic writers at that particular time, while a functional comparative method is adopted. The work does not aim to create its own theory of contract or try to engage in the theoretical debate of which universal values 'should' apply. The implications of the research findings are that policies at a European level can more accurately identify the core underlying values if they firstly identify the viability of harmonising areas of contract law and at a national level and evaluate potential legislative changes in light of these values. Additionally, identification of the values also allows further research on the desirability of the values to be conducted...|$|R

40|$|The {{position}} of the whistle-blower {{is known to be}} a precarious one, with the whistle-blower often either regarded as a hero or a reprehensible traitor. Various pieces of legislation have attempted to remedy their precarious position, especially within the employment relationship, and in which the whistle-blower more often than not has the most to lose. The study at hand has the specific objective of comparing the {{position of}} the whistle-blower in terms of South African Law, against 16 specific measurables, and in comparison with the {{position of the}} whistle-blower in New Zealand, Australia (Victoria) and the United Kingdom. In the main, the protection offered to the whistle-blower within the South African context, is embodied within the Protected <b>Disclosure</b> Act 26 <b>of</b> 2000 (hereinafter referred to as the “PDA”). In examining the protection afforded to the whistle-blower in South Africa, it is concluded that the framework involved extends much further than just the mere provisions in the PDA. However, there are admitted challenges in respect of this framework as discussed, both legislative and non-legislative, especially in respect <b>of</b> <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>disclosures</b> placed on persons in circumstances in which concurrent protection is not afforded to the whistle-blower. With reference to the comparison in respect of the measurement parameters set, {{it was found that the}} PIDA (UK) meets the least amount of the measurements set, with the PDA A (Australia, Victoria) meeting the most of the measurements; the PDA NZ is equally balanced in meeting and not meeting the measurements and the PDA meeting less of the measurements than not, but still meeting more than the PIDA. It was found that had it not been for the catch-all provision contained in section 4 (1) (b) of the PDA, the PDA would have ranked last. Mercantile LawLL...|$|R

40|$|This work is {{a search}} for deeper {{understanding}} of established differences and similarities among compared legal systems. The application of economically inspired optimal model rule as a uniform term of comparison provides additional insights {{into some of the}} most often discussed legal issues. The assessed topics <b>of</b> pre-contractual <b>duties</b> <b>of</b> <b>disclosure,</b> the phenomena <b>of</b> unforeseen contingencies and the unilateral termination of contracts has triggered the attention of both legal and the law and economics’ scholars and are generally considered as one of the several persisting legal puzzles. While surveying law and economics’ literature and systematizing into the economically inspired optimal model rules used as uniform terms of comparisons the real driving force behind legal changes appear as evident. The fruitfulness of approach appears in the objective evaluation framework which enabled all consequent results. Analysis shows that in all three comparative essays following conclusions appear repeatedly in an unprecedented form. (1) All three assessments reveal that compared legal systems differ less than comparatists tend to believe. (2) Provided comparisons surprisingly reveal a growing trend from inefficient towards efficient legal practices. In other words, assessments reveal that legal systems invariably tend towards efficiency. (3) All comparisons reveal wealth maximization as the main driving force behind the judicial decision making. (4) In all examinations economically inspired optimal model rule provides an objective framework for explaining inconsistencies or similarities, and an objective justification for certain statutory provisions or decisions, where doctrinal justification failed. (5) All assessments also offer path for statutory reform. Upon those findings one may argue that indeed the main driving force behind legal changes in contract law is the economics, i. e. the wealth maximization. Moreover, the economically inspired objective evaluation method enriches traditional comparative contract law by enabling further qualitative assessment, previously left to the subjective intuitions or even to a majoritarian voting of comparatists. It offers ample opportunities for further research and for “better” law making, legislation and jurisprudence. Actually, it enables comparative contract law to offer clear-cut, objective recommendations on the possible improvements of legal rules or decisions, and to provide an objective, from national law separated evaluation on which law, doctrine and decision is a “better” one...|$|R
