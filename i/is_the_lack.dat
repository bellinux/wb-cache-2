5|$|Although {{the airport}} is capable of {{handling}} Boeing 767 aircraft, for large numbers of these aircraft, significant investment would be needed. Consequently, the largest aircraft regularly flying to the airport are Boeing 757. The main problem at the airport <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of ramp space, with just two parking positions for large aircraft. As a result, El Al operates regular shuttle flights to Ben Gurion International Airport carrying passengers {{from around the world}} on 757s and 737s.|$|E
50|$|Another major {{difference}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of independent principalities; this <b>was</b> due to <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of vassalage. As separate lords did not command their own troops {{to protect their}} own lands.|$|R

5|$|There {{has been}} raised {{criticism}} against several fundamental shortcomings in the network system. The most fundamental <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of indoor coverage. This has in part been reversed by increasing the signal strength in urban areas and installing repeaters at for instance medical clinics, Oslo Courthouse and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Other shortcomings are that the location of base stations are publicly know, allowing for easy sabotage and increased investment costs because of {{the choice of the}} proprietary TEDS instead of the open ETSI system.|$|E
5|$|To Cairano, also, is {{attributed}} the Altar of San Girolamo {{in the church}} of St Francis. One of the critical issues of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of historical sources on its origin. Certainly the altar was carved after 1506, given its high quality and artistic originality, indeed {{the highest level of}} art in the Brescian period, and evokes several features of Cairano's earlier work on the Loggia and front-yard of San Pietro's church in Oliveto.|$|E
5|$|Unless the {{pituitary}} {{damage is}} being {{caused by a}} tumor that overproduces a particular hormone, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of pituitary hormones {{that leads to the}} symptoms described above, and an excess of a particular hormone would indicate the presence of a tumor. The exception to this rule is prolactin: if a tumor compresses the pituitary stalk, a decreased blood supply means that the lactotrope cells, which produce prolactin, are not receiving dopamine and therefore produce excess prolactin. Hence, mild elevations in prolactin are attributed to stalk compression. Very high prolactin levels, though, point more strongly towards a prolactinoma (prolactin-secreting tumor).|$|E

50|$|Racine's work faced many criticisms {{from his}} contemporaries. One <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of {{historic}} veracity in plays such as Britannicus (1669) and Mithridate (1673). Racine {{was quick to}} point out that his greatest critics - his rival dramatists - <b>were</b> among <b>the</b> biggest offenders in this respect. Another major criticism levelled at him <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of incident in his tragedy Bérénice (1670). Racine's response <b>was</b> that <b>the</b> greatest tragedy does not necessarily consist in bloodshed and death.|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} causes {{of an urban}} heat island (UHI); for example, dark {{surfaces}} absorb significantly more solar radiation, which causes urban concentrations of roads and buildings to heat more than suburban and rural areas during the day; materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs, such as concrete and asphalt, have significantly different thermal bulk properties (including heat capacity and thermal conductivity) and surface radiative properties (albedo and emissivity) than the surrounding rural areas. This causes {{a change in the}} energy budget of the urban area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. Another major reason <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of evapotranspiration (for example, through lack of vegetation) in urban areas. With a decreased amount of vegetation, cities also lose the shade and cooling effect of trees, and the removal of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Without seismic data or {{knowledge}} of its moment of inertia, little direct {{information is available}} about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus. The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, the Venusian core is at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling {{at about the same}} rate. The slightly smaller size of Venus means pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior than Earth's. The principal difference between the two planets <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous. This results in reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an internally generated magnetic field.|$|E

25|$|In each {{of these}} areas, there is {{considerable}} debate as to the optimal treatment.
