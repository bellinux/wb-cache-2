500|$|Hartman {{became one}} of the stars of the NBC sitcom NewsRadio in 1995, portraying radio news anchor Bill McNeal. He signed up after being {{attracted}} by the show's writing and use of an ensemble cast, and joked that he based McNeal on himself with [...] "any ethics and character" [...] removed. Hartman made roughly $50,000 per episode of NewsRadio. Although the show was critically acclaimed, it was never a ratings hit and cancellation was a regular threat. After the completion of the fourth season, Hartman commented, [...] "We seem to have limited appeal. We're on the edge here, not sure we're going to be picked up or not", but added he was [...] "99percent sure" [...] the series would be renewed for a fifth season. Hartman had publicly lambasted NBC's decision to repeatedly move NewsRadio into different timeslots, but later regretted his comments, saying, [...] "this is a sitcom, <b>for</b> <b>crying</b> out loud, not brain surgery". He also stated that if the sitcom were cancelled [...] "it just will open up other opportunities for me". Although the show was renewed for a fifth season, Hartman died before production began. Ken Tucker praised Hartman's performance as McNeal: [...] "A lesser performer [...] would have played him as a variation on The Mary Tyler Moore Shows Ted Baxter, because that's what Bill was, on paper. But Hartman gave infinite variety to Bill's self-centeredness, turning him devious, cowardly, squeamish, and foolishly bold from week to week." [...] Hartman was posthumously nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1998 for his work on NewsRadio, but lost to David Hyde Pierce.|$|E

40|$|Evolution of {{resistance}} in pests threatens the long-term efficacy of insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) used in sprays and transgenic crops. Previous work showed that genetically modified Bt toxins Cry 1 AbMod and Cry 1 AcMod effectively countered resistance to native Bt toxins Cry 1 Ab and Cry 1 Ac in some pests, including pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella). Here {{we report that}} Cry 1 AbMod and Cry 1 AcMod were also effective against a laboratory-selected strain of pink bollworm resistant to Cry 2 Ab {{as well as to}} Cry 1 Ab and Cry 1 Ac. Resistance ratios based on the concentration of toxin killing 50 % of larvae for the resistant strain relative to a susceptible strain were 210 <b>for</b> <b>Cry</b> 2 Ab, 270 <b>for</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab, and 310 <b>for</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac, but only 1. 6 <b>for</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 AbMod and 2. 1 <b>for</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 AcMod. To evaluate the interactions among toxins, we tested combinations of Cry 1 AbMod, Cry 1 Ac, and <b>Cry</b> 2 Ab. <b>For</b> both the resistant and susceptible strains, the net results across all concentrations tested showed slight but significant synergism between Cry 1 AbMod and Cry 2 Ab, whereas the other combinations of toxins did not show consistent synergism or antagonism. The results suggest that the modified toxins might be useful for controlling populations of pink bollworm resistant to Cry 1 Ac, Cry 2 Ab, or both...|$|R

2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B-. While she liked the episode, she left some reservations: [...] "Ultimately, depending on what you want from your Once, “Dreamcatcher” {{was a bit of}} a let down. It moved the plot along, but at a feverish pace and with built in leaps in faith and storyline that just haven’t been explained enough. (How, for instance, did Emma learn that she could capture memories in dreamcatchers? [...] And why is that the craft she chose now that she doesn’t need to sleep?) Maybe all those assumptions and conclusions will be eventually explained in one of those “ohhhhh, I get it now” summations a couple of episodes down the road, but maybe not. Once’s writers and creators have a tendency to play fast and loose with their storylines, knowing their audience will just kind of accept it and move on. Thus, these kinds of leaps aren’t really out of the question for them. (You can’t blame them, really. We’re already watching a show about fairy tales, <b>for</b> <b>crying</b> out loud.) But I didn’t really get “Dreamcatcher.” I’m not sure that I’m supposed to yet, and down the road I might change my mind and say, “you know, that was the episode I need to go back and watch now that I know what I know.” But for now, it just left me a little cold.

40|$|Abstract. - Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is Gram {{positive}} bacterium {{which forms}} endospores and produces parasporal crystals, which are toxic to specific lepidopterous and dipterous insects. In this study, 70 spore former rods {{were selected from}} 470 bacterial colonies, obtained from 72 soil and sand samples from different habitats and parts of Pakistan. Out of these 70 strains, 48 gave positive tests specific for Bt. Only three strains were positive <b>for</b> <b>cry</b> 1 C gene. Three isolates (MS-SBS-Bt 1 - 3) were found positive <b>for</b> <b>cry</b> 1 Ca, and two (MS-SBS-Bt 4 - 5) were found positive <b>for</b> <b>cry</b> 1 Cb genes. All cry 1 C genes were 99 % homologous when aligned on alignment tool BLAST. The optimum growth conditions and antibiotic sensitivity of the isolates were determined. Bioassays showed that MS-SBSBt 1 was more toxic to Spodoptera litura, compared to control HD 137, more toxic to Musca domestica compared to control HD 29, and less toxic to Heliothes virescens compared to HD 29...|$|R
