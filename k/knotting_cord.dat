50|$|<b>Knotted</b> <b>cords</b> {{were used}} by rope stretchers, royal {{surveyors}} who measured out the sides of fields (Egyptian 3ht). The <b>knotted</b> <b>cords</b> (Egyptian ht) were 100 royal cubits in length, with a knot every hayt or 10 royal cubits. The rope stretchers stretched the rope {{in order to take}} the sag out it, as well as to keep the measures uniform.|$|R
50|$|A rope may {{refer to}} any of several units of {{measurement}} initially determined or formed by ropes or <b>knotted</b> <b>cords.</b>|$|R
50|$|The single tally stick was an {{elongated}} piece of bone, ivory, wood, or stone which is {{marked with a}} system of notches (see: Tally marks). The single tally stick serves predominantly mnemonic purposes. Related to the single tally concept are messenger sticks (e.g., Inuit tribes), the <b>knotted</b> <b>cords,</b> khipus or quipus, as used by the Inca. Herodotus (c. 485-425 BC) reported {{the use of a}} <b>knotted</b> <b>cord</b> by Darius I of Persia (c. 521-486 BC).|$|R
60|$|Logan {{threw down}} his <b>knotted</b> <b>cord.</b> 'I beg your pardon, Mr. Macrae,' he said, 'but if I had that dog {{in my house}} of Kirkburn--' he then went out.|$|R
5000|$|Schoenus (schœnus; σχοίνος, schoinos, [...] "rush rope"; i͗trw, [...] "river-measure") was {{an ancient}} Egyptian, Greek and Roman {{unit of length}} and area based on the <b>knotted</b> <b>cords</b> first used in Egyptian surveying.|$|R
50|$|It {{is made of}} {{wood with}} thin waist like and hourglass. The skin on the both sides in {{tightened}} with ropes that helps in holding the instrument firmly too. Its design {{is very similar to}} other Indian drums: the simple Damru, the Udukai, and the sophisticated Idakka. The Damru has <b>knotted</b> <b>cords</b> to stuck its both sides but Dhadd does not have any chord. Damru is played by shaking/rotating quickly so that the <b>knotted</b> <b>cords</b> stuck its both sides and also played with a stick sometimes. The Udukai and the Dhad have similar technique of playing, but the social significance is different.|$|R
60|$|When the Jester, arrayed in the cowl and frock of the hermit, {{and having}} his <b>knotted</b> <b>cord</b> twisted round his middle, {{stood before the}} portal of the castle of Front-de-Boeuf, the warder demanded of him his name and errand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, Larico," [...] I {{answered}} grimly, [...] "and if aught of ill befalls me, {{remember that}} this," [...] and I touched the <b>knotted</b> <b>cords,</b> [...] "will {{find its way}} to Kari, {{and with it the}} man who was your messenger." ...|$|R
60|$|In the chapter-house Henry caused each of {{the clergy}} present, {{to the number of}} eighty, to strike him over the {{shoulders}} with a <b>knotted</b> <b>cord,</b> and afterward spent the whole night beside the tomb. He heard mass the next morning, and returned to London.|$|R
25|$|Quipu, a <b>knotted</b> <b>cord</b> device, {{used in the}} Inca Empire and its {{predecessor}} societies in the Andean region to record accounting and other digital data, is encoded in a base ten positional system. Zero {{is represented by the}} absence of a knot in the appropriate position.|$|R
50|$|A <b>knotted</b> <b>cord</b> was a {{primitive}} surveyor's tool for measuring distances. It is {{a length of}} <b>cord</b> with <b>knots</b> at regular intervals. They were eventually replaced by surveyor's chains, which being made of metal were less prone to stretching and thus were more accurate and consistent.|$|R

50|$|The Pueblo revolt {{was typical}} of millenarian {{movements}} in colonial societies. Popé promised that, once the Spanish were killed or expelled, the ancient Pueblo gods would reward them with health and prosperity. Popé's plan was that the inhabitants of each Pueblo would rise up and kill the Spanish in their area and then all would advance on Santa Fe to kill or expel all the remaining Spanish. The date set for the uprising was August 11, 1680. Popé dispatched runners to all the Pueblos carrying <b>knotted</b> <b>cords.</b> Each morning the Pueblo leadership was to untie one <b>knot</b> from the <b>cord,</b> and when the last knot was untied, {{that would be the}} signal for them to rise against the Spaniards in unison. On August 9, however, the Spaniards were warned of the impending revolt by southern Tiwa leaders and they captured two Tesuque Pueblo youths entrusted with carrying the message to the pueblos. They were tortured to make them reveal the significance of the <b>knotted</b> <b>cord.</b>|$|R

50|$|A <b>knotted</b> <b>cord</b> 12 lengths long (the units do not matter) closed into a loop {{can be used}} to lay out a {{right angle}} by forming the loop of cord into a 3-4-5 triangle. This could be used for laying out the corner of a field or a {{building}} foundation, for instance.|$|R
50|$|Some {{members of}} strict monastic orders, and {{some members of}} the Catholic lay {{organization}} Opus Dei, practice mild self-flagellation using an instrument of penance called a discipline, a cattail whip usually made of <b>knotted</b> <b>cords,</b> which is flung over the shoulders repeatedly during private prayer. Pope John Paul II took the discipline regularly.|$|R
50|$|The many {{tools and}} writing {{materials}} used throughout history include stone tablets, clay tablets, bamboo slats, wax tablets, vellum, parchment, paper, copperplate, styluses, quills, ink brushes, pencils, pens, and many styles of lithography.

5000|$|<b>Knotted</b> <b>cords</b> {{were used}} by many ancient cultures. The Greek schoenus is {{referred}} to as a rope used to measure land. Ropes generally became cables and chains with Pythagoras making the Greek agros a chain of 10 stadia equal to a nautical mile c 540 BC. The Romans used a waxed cord for measuring distances.|$|R

60|$|He {{flung the}} length of <b>knotted</b> <b>cord</b> {{to one of the}} negroes, who in an instant made it fast about the prisoner's brows. Then between cord and cranium the black {{inserted}} a short length of metal, round and slender as a pipe-stem. That done he rolled his eyes towards Levasseur, awaiting the Captain's signal.|$|R
5|$|The {{depiction}} of the galero in arms can vary greatly depending on the artist's style. The top of the hat may be shown flat or round. Sometimes the brim is shown much narrower; with a domed top it can look like a cappello romano with tassels, but in heraldry it is still called a galero. The tassels may be represented as <b>knotted</b> <b>cords.</b>|$|R

It now consists of white <b>knotted</b> <b>cord</b> worn around the left shoulder, and affixed to the left breast pocket button, or second jacket button for women in Service Dress with jackets.|$|R
40|$|Background: True {{umbilical}} <b>cord</b> <b>knot</b> {{is one of}} the {{abnormalities of}} the umbilical cord. Active fetal movements create <b>cord</b> <b>knotting.</b> True umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>knots</b> are rare but may be associated with fetal distress and stillbirth. True umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>knots</b> are capable of impeding blood flow to the fetus. Case presentation: A 26 -year old primigravid woman was first treated for genital herpes simplex virus (HSV type 2) at 36 weeks of gestational age. She received oral acyclovir (400 mg three times daily for 10 days). At the gestational age of 38 weeks and 5 days, fetal activity decreased and NST was nonreactive. She was delivered by cesarean section and a true umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>knot</b> was found. Four years later, in her second pregnancy, another true knot was seen. Conclusion: Excessively long umbilical cords {{are more likely to be}} associated with true knots. Genetics has an important role in determining cord length and occurrence of true knots...|$|R
5000|$|A witch's ladder (also {{known as}} rope and feathers, witches' ladder, witches ladder, or witch ladder) is a practice, in folk magic or witchcraft, {{that is made}} from <b>knotted</b> <b>cord</b> or hair, that {{normally}} constitutes a spell. Charms are knotted or braided with specific magical intention into the cords. The number of knots and nature of charms varies with the intended effect (or [...] "spell").|$|R
40|$|Intrauterine factors {{important}} for cognitive development, such as birth weight, chorionicity and umbilical cord characteristics were investigated. A total of 663 twin pairs completed the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children- Revised and scores {{were available for}} Performance, Verbal and Total Intelligence Quotient (IQ). The intrauterine factors examined were birth weight, placental weight and morphology, <b>cord</b> <b>knots,</b> <b>cord</b> length and cord insertion. IQ scores for the varying levels of the intrauterine markers adjusting for gender and gestational age were calculated. The heritability of IQ and the association between IQ and intrauterine environment were examined. Twins with lower birth weight and <b>cord</b> <b>knots</b> had lower IQ scores. The aetiology of IQ is largely distinct from that of birth weight and <b>cord</b> <b>knots,</b> and non- shared environment may influence the observed relationships...|$|R
5000|$|On October 17, 1940, in the Bois de Caugnet between Saint-Antoine-l'Abbaye and Montagne, near Saint Marcellin, French hunters {{discovered}} Münzenberg's partially decomposed corpse at {{the foot}} of an oak tree. The initial newspaper report stated that {{the cause of death was}} strangulation caused by a [...] "knotted cord" [...] but other sources state that the cause of death was a garrote (a weapon usually formed from a <b>knotted</b> rope or <b>cord).</b> The body was found resting upright on the knees, with a <b>knotted</b> <b>cord</b> draped over the skull. The <b>knotted</b> <b>cord</b> had apparently snapped soon after the body had been suspended from an overhead branch. The police investigation of the circumstances of his death, including the brief coroner's report, did not interrogate Münzenberg's fellow camp inmates, and cause of death was listed officially as suicide. However, several eyewitnesses at the prison camp, including Valentin Hartig and Hans Siemsen, reported that Münzenberg remained in high spirits both during his days at Chambaran and in the first days of his flight to freedom after which they lost sight of their comrade. That tends to support the conclusion that Münzenberg was intentionally killed, either by Soviet NKVD agents or by party members acting on Stalin's orders.|$|R
25|$|Surveying and {{itinerant}} measurement were undertaken using rods, poles, and <b>knotted</b> <b>cords</b> of rope. A {{scene in}} the tomb of Menna in Thebes shows surveyors measuring a plot of land using rope with knots tied at regular intervals. Similar scenes {{can be found in}} the tombs of Amenhotep-Sesi, Khaemhat and Djeserkareseneb. The balls of rope are also shown in New Kingdom statues of officials such as Senenmut, Amenemhet-Surer, and Penanhor.|$|R
50|$|Since land {{in ancient}} Egypt was {{measured}} using several different units, {{there would have been}} <b>knotted</b> <b>cords</b> with the <b>knots</b> spaced in each unit. Among these were the mh t3 or land cubits, remen royal cubits, rods or ha3t, generally the lengths in multiples of 100 units. The longest measured length listed in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus is a circumference of about a Roman mile with a diameter of 9 khet.|$|R
50|$|In ancient Egypt, a rope {{stretcher}} (or harpedonaptai) was a surveyor who measured {{real property}} demarcations and foundations using <b>knotted</b> <b>cords,</b> stretched so the rope did not sag. When {{performed by a}} king to begin building a temple the stretching of the rope was probably a religious ceremony. On artefacts as ancient as the Scorpion Macehead, Egyptians documented the royal surveyors' procedure for restoring the boundaries of fields after each flood.|$|R
