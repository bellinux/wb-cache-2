[...] but stated that [...] "the serial became lost in multitude of vamps, warring families, crude language and events that in real life are unfathomable."

5|$|Washington {{received}} no {{support from the}} Lakers front office, aside from a single call {{the day after the}} fight from Cooke, and was sent torrents of <b>hate</b> <b>mail</b> filled with racial epithets. He was advised by police not to order room service when he played again, as it was feared he would be poisoned. Larry Fleisher, head of the Players' Association, wanted Washington to appeal his suspension, an idea which he originally considered, but ultimately rejected. Although many players around the league sympathized with Washington and said that he had a good reputation off the court, he and his wife became ostracized. They had a two-year-old daughter, and Washington's wife was eight months pregnant with the couple's first son {{at the time of the}} punch. His wife recalls her and the children being treated like pariahs after the incident. Her obstetrician refused her service because she was Washington's wife, and her friends asked her what kind of person Washington was that he could commit such an act. The only person who contacted them was Newell. Later in the year Washington went to his home with a big screen television which he insisted Newell accept.|$|E

In Coke Studio season 8 Umair performed the song [...] "Sammi Meri Waar" [...] with QB which received {{more than two million}} views in two weeks. In an interview to The Express Tribune he told that he also received <b>hate</b> <b>mails</b> after release of the song. Umair said: “Man!

40|$|The global {{migration}} of professional athletes has escalated {{during the last}} a few decades (Magee 2 ̆ 6 Sugdeen, 2002). Especially in baseball, after the inception of free agency in the early 1970 s, the influx {{of large numbers of}} Latin American players transformed the face of the game of baseball. Although several Korean players participated in American professional baseball in the 1980 s, {{it is safe to say}} that Chan Ho Park in 1994 paved the way from Korean baseball to Major League Baseball. Park became a staff ace for the LA Dodgers, winning 18 games in 2000; for Koreans, who were suffering an economic depression, he became a national hero. Many young Korean players crossed the Pacific Ocean with hopes of becoming another Park. In reality, most of the Korean prospects had a difficult time on and off the field. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the stories of cultural conflicts experienced by Korean minor league baseball players in America. To guide the narrative, I will utilize World Systems theory to analyze and compare the differences between the migratory patterns of Korean players and those of Japanese players. In short, while most Japanese players are considered to be fully developed and ready to commence their Major League careers, most Korean players are regarded as young, inexperienced who therefore have to navigate the minor league systems to survive. This means that they have to deal not only with baseball but also with homesickness, language barriers, and cultural differences. However, unlike the Major Leagues, minor league organizations do not have the resources to help these players with the challenges they face. Jae-Kuk Ryu, a former pitcher for the Chicago Cubs, is an example of the phenomenon that is explored in this paper. In April 2003, during a pregame practice in Daytona, Florida, Ryu threw a baseball at an osprey and the bird eventually died; Ryu later told reporters that his act had been instigated by the opposing players, but he had to pay a 500 fine and serve 100 hours of community service. In addition, he was demoted to the Single-A Lansing organization. This became a media issue that resulted in Ryu’s receiving many <b>hate</b> <b>mails</b> from fans. The incident will be discussed in this paper within the context of the Asian American stereotype of being diligent and subservient or the so called “Model Minority” (Mayeda 1999) ...|$|R

Davis and Britt had one daughter, Tracey, and adopted two sons.|$|E
25|$|Schmeling's entourage also {{included}} an official Nazi Party publicist.

Hitler himself lifted the nationwide 3:00 a.m. curfew so that cafés and bars could carry the broadcast for their patrons. As a result, the perception of the American public had turned decidedly against Schmeling between 1936 and 1938. Schmeling was picketed at his hotel room, received a tremendous amount of <b>hate</b> <b>mail,</b> and was assaulted with cigarette butts and other detritus as he approached the ring.|$|E

It was called Corruptions of Empire (1988) and its cover featured a portrayal of Admiral George Cockburn torching the White House with slaves escaping. To follow up Cockburn published The Golden Age Is In Us: Journeys and Encounters (1995) in the much the same mode combining diary entries with columns, essays, and letters even including <b>hate</b> <b>mail.</b> The last collection in this series was A Colossal Wreck: A Road Trip Through Political Scandal, Corruption, and American Culture (2013), which was published posthumously, and he only completed it days before his death.|$|E

25|$|After Earnhardt's death, both {{a police}} {{investigation}} and a NASCAR-sanctioned investigation commenced; nearly {{every detail of}} the crash was made public. The allegations of seatbelt failure resulted in Bill Simpson's resignation from the company bearing his name, which manufactured the seatbelts used in Earnhardt's car and nearly every other NASCAR driver's car. NASCAR implemented rigorous safety improvements, such as mandating the HANS device, which Earnhardt refused to wear after finding it restrictive and uncomfortable. Several press conferences were held in the days following Earnhardt's death. After driver Sterling Marlin and his relatives received <b>hate</b> <b>mail</b> and death threats from angry fans, Waltrip and Earnhardt Jr. absolved him of any responsibility. Richard Childress made a public pledge that the number 3 would never again adorn the side of a black race car with a GM Goodwrench sponsorship.

25|$|On {{his return}} from Australia, Cowdrey decided {{to drop out of}} Oxford so he could {{concentrate}} on his career with Kent and England. No longer an undergraduate he was called up for national service, but discharged after two weeks in the Royal Air Force due to a hereditary disability of rigid toes on which he previously had an operation. This caused some controversy as he promptly made 44, 101, 5, 139, 48, 44, 115 not out and 103 not out, hardly the scores of an invalid. The press suggested that strings had been pulled on his behalf and questions were asked in the House of Commons by Gerald Nabarro MP, though he apologised after the true facts became known. Cowdrey received <b>hate</b> <b>mail</b> from the parents of national servicemen, and took great care to answer them personally. He was called up for the Third Test against South Africa, but was battered by the fast bowlers Peter Heine and Neil Adcock making 1 and 50, which he considered to be the worse bruising of his career and Cowdrey pulled out of the series rather than add to his injuries.|$|E

Jason Whitlock criticized Scott's use of Jay-Z's alternate nickname, [...] "Jigga", at halftime of Monday Night Football as ridiculous and offensive.
