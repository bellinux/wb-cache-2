In the <b>ex-post</b> <b>analysis,</b> the Rachev {{ratio is}} {{computed}} by dividing the corresponding two sample AVaR's. Since the performance levels in the Rachev ratio are quantiles of the active return distribution, they are relative levels as they adjust according to the distribution.

After an introduction about the objectives and instruments of the 2007 - 2013 EU Cohesion Policy, and in particular the legal framework for co-financing environmental and transport projects, the paper illustrates and discusses some methodological choices which have been made by the authors of the EC CBA Guide. It is showed that, without an <b>ex-post</b> Cost-Benefit <b>analysis,</b> the ex-ante exercise is also weakened as a decision making tool. In particular, in the light of evidence from literature about the most common mistakes and pitfalls in ex-ante project appraisal, it is explained how systematic ex-post evaluation is important in particular linked to ex-ante incentives to reveal true information about the projects characteristics (especially on investment costs and demand forecast which are often respectively under and overestimated due to an optimism bias) and ex-post performance assessment. The EC has a unique role to play in this context, and recommendations are given about how to improve the use of CBA for investment decisions and how to contract co-funding of major projects in the framework of incentive theory.

The volume of investments and their performance significantly determine the economic conditions in the future, and have long-term consequences on business and its success as well as the entire economy. Since the resources for the investments are usually limited and usually the main objective of investment is a profit or at least adeguate level of benefits, {{it is important that the}} project preparation considers all possible factors which affect the success of the investment. Therefore, there are different methods for assessing the effectiveness of the investment applied. Usually the prediction of the effects of investment (ex-ante) is being performed less often one can see the analysis of the effects of investment and the analysis of the effects of investment analysis (<b>ex-post).</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the effects of investment is extremely important, as it allows for corrections and improves the prediction of the effects of the following investments their corrections in the thesis, I have focused primarily on <b>ex-post</b> <b>analysis,</b> which analyzes the performance of the investments after they were developed.

40|$|Ex-ante <b>ex-post</b> <b>analysis</b> {{has become}} a {{standard}} tool in macroeconomics. Yet Keynes dismissed it. We argue that Keynes's dismissal of ex-ante <b>ex-post</b> <b>analysis</b> is not an oddity but {{an indication of the}} originality of his theory of employment compared to standard macroeconomics. First, the principle of effective demand does not amount to a process that determines employment and income at the point of intersection of the traditionally defined ex ante supply and demand functions. Second, the finance motive allowed Keynes to confirm the identity of aggregate supply and demand already asserted in The General Theory. This latter conclusion is puzzling, however, since the principle of effective demand presupposes the possibility of a discrepancy between supply and demand. We suggest that Keynes's theory of employment is linked to a theory of income distribution whereby profits are a redistributed share of factor income which is transferred to firms when prices exceed factor costs. The identity and the equilibrium condition then relate to separate measurements of income and output, factor cost and prices. ...|$|E

The (qualitative) results are robust with respect to different sizes of the shocks. The results for the unemployment shock do not change much when we model it as an increase of the unemployment rate by 5 percentage points for each country. It would be further possible to derive more complicated scenarios with different shocks on different income sources or a combination of income and unemployment shock. However, this would only have an impact on the distribution of changes which are not relevant in the analysis of this paper. Therefore, we focus on these two simple scenarios in order to make our analysis as simple as possible. One should note, though, that our analysis is not a forecasting exercise. We do not aim at quantifying the exact effects of the recent economic crisis but of stylized scenarios in order to explore the build-in automatic stabilizers of existing pre-crisis tax-benefit systems. Conducting an <b>ex-post</b> <b>analysis</b> would include discretionary government reactions and behavioral responses (see, e.g., Aaberge et al.
