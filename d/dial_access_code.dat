50|$|For {{calling from}} Israel to another country: choose operator, and <b>dial</b> its {{international}} <b>access</b> <b>code,</b> then <b>dial</b> destination country code {{and then the}} rest of the local number.|$|R
50|$|To call Kenya {{from other}} countries, {{subscribers}} must <b>dial</b> their international <b>access</b> <b>code</b> e.g. 00 for most European countries, and 011 from North America, {{followed by the}} country code 254. The international <b>access</b> <b>code</b> for calls from Kenya is 000.|$|R
50|$|Callers {{from outside}} the NANP (country code +1), {{including}} callers from the French side of the island, must <b>dial</b> their international <b>access</b> <b>code</b> (often 00) followed by 1 721. Callers within the NANP dial 1 721 and the seven-digit telephone number.|$|R
50|$|Later, a {{more modern}} {{indirect}} service was introduced which required only the <b>dialling</b> of the <b>access</b> <b>code</b> ('132') and the destination number. Mercury also provided backbone services to the emerging groups of British cable operators which were beginning to offer their own fixed-line telephone services.|$|R
50|$|The No. 4 Crossbar {{switching}} system {{had been introduced}} in the 1940s to switch four-wire circuits and replace the incoming operator. With semiautomatic operation analogous to {{the early days of}} the panel switch, the operator in the originating city used a multifrequency keypad to <b>dial</b> an <b>access</b> <b>code</b> to connect to the correct city and to send the seven digit number to incoming equipment at the terminating city. This design was further refined to serve DDD.|$|R
5000|$|As this {{jurisdiction}} {{is part of}} the North American Numbering Plan, callers {{from outside}} the NANP area dial into this area as they would dial any number in the US or Canada (or any other NANP member), by <b>dialing</b> their international <b>access</b> <b>code,</b> the country code 1, the area code 684, then the phone number.|$|R
50|$|This change provokes {{an error}} in citing mobile numbers, quite {{similar to that of}} {{erroneous}} UK telephone codes. The first digit of the subscriber number is most often cited as part of the <b>access</b> <b>code,</b> e.g. (0)887 XXX XXX, instead of the correct (0)88 7XXX XXX. This error remains for new subscriber numbers even for Vivacom (which entered the market with the 087 (+7 digits) code and has always remained so). However, unlike the situation in UK, this error has no effect since a mobile number must always be <b>dialled</b> with the <b>access</b> <b>code.</b>|$|R
50|$|International {{calling from}} the UK is {{deregulated}} in that many alternative providers allow very cheap international calling by the caller <b>dialling</b> an <b>access</b> <b>code,</b> usually beginning with the digit 1, followed by the full international code. These services generally use internet-based connections {{in the same way}} as computer-based services such as Skype, Friend Caller and many others, but with the added convenience of there being no need to use a computer. It is this use of the internet for the calls which allows such low prices. Often these same services are available from a mobile phone by the use of a special access number, though in this case there may be a charge equivalent to that of a standard landline call.|$|R
50|$|Country {{codes are}} {{necessary}} only when dialing telephone numbers {{in other countries}} than the originating telephone. These are dialed before the national telephone number. By convention, international telephone numbers are indicated by prefixing the country code with a plus sign (+), which is meant {{to indicate that the}} subscriber must dial the international dialing prefix in the country from which the call is placed. For example, the international <b>dialing</b> prefix or <b>access</b> <b>code</b> in all NANP countries is 011, while it is 00 in most European countries. On GSM networks, + is an actual keypad code that may be recognized automatically by the network carrier in place of the international <b>access</b> <b>code.</b>|$|R
50|$|Telephone and {{cellular}} subscribers' numbers have eight digits. There are no area codes in Malta, but after inception, the original first two numbers, and currently the 3rd and 4th digit, were assigned {{according to the}} locality. Fixed line telephone numbers have the prefix 21 and 27, although businesses may have numbers starting 22 or 23. An example would be 2*80**** if from Å»abbar, and 2*23**** if from Marsa. Gozitan landline numbers generally are assigned 2*56****. Mobile telephone numbers have the prefix 77, 79, 98 or 99. When calling Malta from abroad, one must first <b>dial</b> the international <b>access</b> <b>code,</b> then the country code +356 and the subscriber's number.|$|R
50|$|Eir {{retains a}} virtual {{monopoly}} of around 70% on fixed-line telephony in the State (the only exceptions being those operated by UPC Ireland cable company (formerly NTL Ireland and Chorus), Digiweb Metro and some fibre offerings from BT, Magnet Networks, Smart and Digiweb). Chorus had offered wireless telephony {{but failed to}} renew their licence. Eir is required to allow carrier pre-selection (CPS). Introduced in Ireland in 2001, CPS allows subscribers to use an alternative provider for all their calls, without the need to <b>dial</b> indirect <b>access</b> <b>codes</b> or numbers, although they still receive a bill from Eir for line rental. Under a wholesale line rental scheme, {{it is possible for}} customers, to have a single bill from an alternative provider, for example, Vodafone, including the cost of Eir line rental, rather than continuing to receive a separate one from Eir for this cost. Unlike the UK, where BT's competitors now can charge less than BT for line rental, it is not yet possible for operators in Ireland to buy the lines from Eir and charge their own rate for line rental, should they wish.|$|R
50|$|Non-geographical {{numbers have}} no fixed length, but also {{required}} the dialling {{of the trunk}} <b>access</b> <b>code</b> (0). They are used for mobile telephone networks and other designated service types, such as toll-free <b>dialling,</b> Internet <b>access,</b> voice over IP, restricted audiences, and information resources.|$|R
