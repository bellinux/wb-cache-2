5|$|Elephants {{have been}} the subject of {{religious}} beliefs. The Mbuti people of central Africa believe that the souls of their dead ancestors resided in elephants. Similar ideas existed among other African tribes, who believed that their chiefs would be reincarnated as elephants. During the 10th century AD, the people of Igbo-Ukwu, near the Niger Delta, buried their leaders with elephant tusks. The animals' religious importance is only totemic in Africa but is much more significant in Asia. In Sumatra, elephants have been associated with lightning. Likewise in Hinduism, they are linked with thunderstorms as Airavata, the father of all elephants, represents both lightning and rainbows. One of the most important Hindu deities, the elephant-headed Ganesha, is ranked equal with the supreme gods Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma. Ganesha is associated with writers and merchants and it is believed that he can <b>give</b> <b>people</b> success as well as grant them their desires. In Buddhism, Buddha is said to have been a white elephant reincarnated as a human. In Islamic tradition, the year 570 when Muhammad was born is known as the Year of the Elephant. Elephants were thought to be religious themselves by the Romans, who believed that they worshipped the sun and stars.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea that}} certain diets {{can lead to}} {{extraordinary}} longevity (ages beyond 130) is not new. In 1909, Élie Metchnikoff believed that drinking goat's milk could confer extraordinary longevity.

25|$|After the Second World War, large new neighbourhoods {{were built}} in the western, southeastern, and {{northern}} parts of the city. These new neighbourhoods were built to relieve the city's shortage of living space and <b>give</b> <b>people</b> affordable houses with modern conveniences. The neighbourhoods consisted mainly of large housing blocks situated among green spaces, connected to wide roads, making the neighbourhoods easily accessible by motor car. The western suburbs which {{were built in}} that period are collectively called the Westelijke Tuinsteden. The area to the southeast of the city built during the same period is known as the Bijlmer.|$|E

25|$|This {{leads to}} {{decision}} making by the parents. Rightful parental ownership over the embryo {{is only in}} the short-run and means that they control the embryos biological future. Consent over tissue ownership has been an issue for decades and can have legal repercussions. In the case of Henrietta Lacks, researchers lacked patient consent to use her tissues in genetic research, and this led to many legal issues on the family’s right to profit from the use of her cells. Decisiveness over autonomy is necessary in the case of IVF to avoid long run issues and <b>give</b> <b>people</b> their full rights of humanity.|$|E

25|$|Earthquake warning {{systems could}} {{potentially}} <b>give</b> <b>people</b> {{time to take}} cover {{in the event of}} a quake, preventing injuries caused by falling debris, automatically stopping trains or shutting off gas lines. The system being developed at the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory (called ShakeAlert) in conjunction with the United States Geological Survey, the California Institute of Technology and the University of Washington, will eventually cover the entire West Coast. The system would cost $80 million in funding to run for five years in California, or $120 million for the whole West Coast. In December 2014, United States Congress approved a $5 million allocation as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 in order to expand funding for development of the system.|$|E

They reported him saying it is his oasis in between trips and it's the crew's production home base to debrief before flying all over the world.

Sending cash is cheaper as {{it does not have}} the same transaction costs as shipping goods. Sending cash is also faster than shipping the goods. In 2009 for sub-Saharan Africa, food bought locally by the WFP cost 34 percent less and arrived 100 days faster than food sent from the United States, where buying food from the United States is required by law. Cash aid also helps local food producers, usually the poorest in their countries, while imported food may damage their livelihoods and risk continuing hunger in the future.|$|E

25|$|Responsibility {{for health}} care has been devolved to the Scottish Parliament since it was {{established}} in 1999. The Scottish government has enacted health policies which {{are different from those}} in England, such as abolishing charges for prescriptions and elderly personal care. NHS Scotland has been operationally independent of the NHS {{in the rest of the}} United Kingdom since the formation of the NHS in 1948. Supporters of independence argue that independence is needed because possible reductions in the NHS budget in England would result in reduced funding for Scotland, which would make it difficult to maintain the existing service. Harry Burns, a former chief medical officer for Scotland, said in July 2014 that he thought independence could be beneficial for public health because it may <b>give</b> <b>people</b> greater control of their lives.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} broadened {{land ownership}} by returning land {{that had been}} sold to large landowners in the late Ming period by families unable to pay the land tax. To <b>give</b> <b>people</b> more incentives {{to participate in the}} market, they reduced the tax burden in comparison with the late Ming, and replaced the corvée system with a head tax used to hire laborers. The administration of the Grand Canal was made more efficient, and transport opened to private merchants. A system of monitoring grain prices eliminated severe shortages, and enabled the price of rice to rise slowly and smoothly through the 18th century. Wary of the power of wealthy merchants, Qing rulers limited their trading licenses and usually refused them permission to open new mines, except in poor areas. These restrictions on domestic resource exploration, as well as on foreign trade, are held by some scholars as a cause of the Great Divergence, by which the Western world overtook China economically.|$|E
