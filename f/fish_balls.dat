The study also explored {{the possibility to}} involve rural low-income people in the production and marketing of such products. The production of silver carp was higher in greater Jessore and Mymensingh districts but the price remained low during the peak-harvesting season in October to November. The price varied with size of the fish, season, market characteristics and effective demand of the buyers. Price of about 500 g size fish {{was found to be}} Tk. 20 - 25 /kg in the rural markets. The average size of fish in the rural markets was 3 S 0 - 550 g while that in the urban markets it was 700 - 1, 200 g. The cost of production of the value added products and profit margin were assessed on the basis of market price of the raw material {{as well as that of}} the finished products, transportation, storage and marketing costs. The profit margins of 34 %, 39 %, 81 % and 31 % of their sales price were obtained for <b>fish</b> sausage, <b>fish</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>fish</b> stick and fish burger, respectively.

40|$|Non-conventional seafood products, {{fish sausage}} and <b>fish</b> <b>ball</b> were {{developed}} from underutilized sea catfish and consumer`s acceptance and market {{test of the}} new products were conducted in inland rural and coastal fishing communities. Sea catfish, achysurus thalassinus was collected from Chittagong in an insulated box. The cost of production and profit of the products were assessed in the laboratory of the Faculty of Fisheries, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh, Bangladesh. From a 1000 g catfish, 500 g washed mince could be recovered. From 500 g washed mince, a total of 1000 g dough could be produced and from this dough 17 pieces of fish sausage and 40 pieces of <b>fish</b> <b>ball</b> were produced. The total production cost of the products from 1000 g dough including raw materials, ingredients, wage, transportation, storage and marketing was Tk. 75. Pilot market-testing were done in 10 villages of Mymensingh and six coastal villages of Chittagong. Finally, {{an analysis of the}} cost and profit of production was done {{on the basis of the}} price of product set by the people, the price of raw material in the market, tentative cost of productions and cost of transportation and storage. As per the average selling price obtained from the market tests, products of 1000 g can be sold at Tk. 136 /- for sausage (Tk. 8 /- each) and Tk. 160 /- for <b>fish</b> <b>ball</b> (Tk. 4 /- each) in the rural market of Bangladesh. Therefore, a net profit of Tk. 61 from fish sausage and Tk. 85 from <b>fish</b> <b>ball</b> could be realized, from a manufacture of 1000 g whole sea catfish.

40|$|Abstract approved: <b>Fish</b> <b>ball</b> is an {{extruded}} surimi-based {{product that}} is popular among Asian communities. In the manufacturing of <b>fish</b> <b>ball,</b> optimum floatation is extremely important for maximal production. Factors affecting floatation of <b>fish</b> <b>ball</b> in water were investigated. The density of threadfin bream surimi paste significantly decreased (P<O. 05) as moisture content increased from 80 % to 84 % and temperature increased from 5 °C to 40 °C, to 90 °C. Increased salt concentration from 2 % to 3 % also decreased surimi paste density. The ability of surimi paste to float or sink in water was observed according to changes in density. In gel texture measurement, when surimi was thawed for 1 h before chopping at 5 °C with 2 % salt the highest breaking force and deformation values were obtained. However, when surimi was thawed for 4 h before chopping at 20 °C with 3 % salt, the lowest breaking force and deformation values were found.
