5|$|The American economy, however, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> {{labor force}} {{consisting}} solely of professionals. Instead {{it requires a}} greatly diverse and specialized labor force. Thus the majority of Americans complete assigned tasks with considerably less autonomy and creative freedom than professionals, leading to theory that they may better be described as being members of the working class.|$|E

5|$|Compared to {{standard}} telescopic sights, a reflector sight {{can be held}} at any distance from the eye (<b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> designed eye relief), and at almost any angle, without distorting {{the image of the}} target or reticle. They are often used with both eyes open (the brain will tend to automatically superimpose the illuminated reticle image coming from the dominant eye onto the other eye's unobstructed view), giving the shooter normal depth perception and full field of view. Since Reflector sights are not dependent on eye relief, they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically-convenient mounting position on a weapon.|$|E

5|$|The ectomycorrhizae formed {{between the}} fungus and host plant can be {{influenced}} by soil microorganisms present in the mycorrhizosphere. For example, soil bacteria from the genera Paenibacillus and Burkholderia alter the branching structure of the root, whereas Bacillus species increase root growth and mycorrhizal colonization. The fungus <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> <b>a</b> specific soil but seems to prefer acidic and nutrient-deficient soil. Suillus luteus produces hydroxamic acid-based siderophores, which are compounds that can chelate iron and extract it from the soil in nutrient-poor conditions. Ignacio Chapela and colleagues analysed the carbon uptake of S.luteus in Ecuador, concluding pine plantations accompanied by S.luteus deplete carbon stored in the soil and raising concerns that these {{might not be a}} remedy for rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.|$|E
