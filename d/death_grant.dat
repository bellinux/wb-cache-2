5|$|After Spare's <b>death,</b> <b>Grant</b> {{began to}} focus more on his own writing career. From 1959 to 1963, Grant privately {{published}} the Carfax Monographs, a series of short articles on magic published in ten installments, each at a limited print run of 100. Nine of these volumes included original artworks produced by Steffi, reflecting the increasing collaboration between husband and wife which would be reflected in many of Grant's subsequent publications. The Carfax Monographs would eventually be assembled together and re-released as Hidden Lore in 1989. In 1966 he also privately published a small book of his poems, Black to Black and Other Poems. During the 1950s and 1960s Spare also authored a number of novels, although these would only be published by Starfire Publishing between 1997 and 2012.|$|E
500|$|When Grant {{was nine}} years old, his father placed his mother in Glenside Hospital (a mental institution), {{and told him that}} she had gone away on a [...] "long holiday", later declaring that she had died. Grant grew up resenting his mother, {{particularly}} after she left the family. After Elsie was gone, Grant and his father moved into the home of his grandmother in Bristol. When Grant was 10, his father remarried and started a new family that did not include his son. Grant did not learn that his mother was still alive until he was 31, when his father confessed to the lie, shortly before his own <b>death.</b> <b>Grant</b> made arrangements for his mother to leave the institution in June 1935, shortly after he learned of her whereabouts. He visited her during a break to England in October 1938, after filming for Gunga Din was completed.|$|E
500|$|Lee {{found that}} in {{contrast}} to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a [...] "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed {{like a human being}} and getting sympathy, they feel they have to do things, they have to carry the movie." [...] Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is [...] "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him do, I have to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing... and not [...] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now." [...] For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's <b>death.</b> <b>Grant</b> had been unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, [...] "'There's no other way, and I promise you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and he was very good about it". Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.|$|E

50|$|He is {{reported}} to have died in 1854 aged 69 years although Letters of Administration, after his <b>death,</b> <b>granted</b> to his father Joab states that he died on 22 July 1855. He was interred in Mellor Churchyard.|$|R
500|$|Many {{historians and}} biographers have been {{intrigued}} and challenged by contradictions in Grant's life, and few presidential reputations have shifted as dramatically as his. At his <b>death,</b> <b>Grant</b> {{was seen as}} [...] "a symbol of the American national identity and memory". Soon afterward, Grant's reputation fell under severe criticism as national reconciliation took hold among whites throughout the country. Later accounts portrayed his administration as corrupt; as {{the popularity of the}} pro-Confederate Lost Cause theory and the Dunning School movement grew early in the 20th century, a more negative view of Grant became common. In 1917, historian Louis Arthur Coolidge bucked the trend of negativity and said Grant's [...] "success as President" [...] was [...] "hardly less significant than his success at war." [...] In 1931, historians Paxson and Bach noted that Grant's presidency [...] "had some achievements, after all." [...] In 1934, historian Robert R. McCormick said Grant's military triumphs were neglected {{due in part to the}} [...] "malicious and deliberate design" [...] of Lost Cause veterans and writers. In the 1950s, historians Bruce Catton and T. Harry Williams began a reassessment of Grant's military career, shifting the analysis of Grant as victor by brute force to that of successful, skillful, modern strategist and commander. William S. McFeely won the Pulitzer Prize for his critical 1981 biography that credited Grant's initial presidential efforts on civil rights, but lamented his failure to carry out lasting progress.|$|E

50|$|Grant {{believes}} that the claim the Rome incident was a suicide attempt was not made until after Cobain's <b>death.</b> <b>Grant</b> claims that people close to Cobain, including Nirvana's management Gold Mountain Records, specifically denied the characterization prior to Cobain's <b>death.</b> <b>Grant</b> {{believes that}} if Rome had truly been a suicide attempt, Cobain's friends and family would have been told {{so that they could}} have watched over him.|$|E

50|$|A {{very large}} part of the {{narrative}} rests on four women from Klosterman's past and present who embody abstractions that he loves (and are later compared to the four original members of KISS). In the same way that a rock star's <b>death</b> <b>grants</b> them a transcendence of anything that they may have embodied during the course of their life, so, too, these four women transcend their own effect on Klosterman to become the molds by which all other women will undoubtedly fall short.|$|R

5000|$|The Grant Museum of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy is {{a natural}} history museum {{that is part of}} University College London in London, England.

50|$|From 1876 {{until his}} <b>death,</b> <b>Grant</b> was {{constantly}} {{being pursued by}} creditors in the courts.

He was declared bankrupt in 1877, but attempted to regain his fortune by establishing a new bank in 1878. This failed, and he was again in the bankruptcy court in 1885. A third and final receiving order was made against him a few days before his death in 1899. A large house he had built for himself in Kensington was demolished in 1883, with the site sold.

Grant finally relented and let Custer fight under Brig. Gen. Alfred Terry. Two months after Custer's <b>death</b> <b>Grant</b> castigated him in the press, saying [...] "I regard Custer's massacre as a sacrifice of troops, brought on by Custer himself, that was wholly unnecessary - wholly unnecessary." [...] As the nation {{was shocked by the}} death of Custer, Grant's Peace policy became militaristic; Congress appropriated funds for 2,500 more troops, two more forts were constructed, the army took over the Indian agencies, while Indians were barred from purchasing rifles and ammunition.|$|E
