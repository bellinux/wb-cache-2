If a high viscous paste and slow drying is required like in screen-printing processes PEDOT:PSS can also be supplied in high boiling solvents like propanediol.

Includes bibliographical references and (some col. illustrations). Coating tensioned-web running over slot die is an efficient way of depositing thin and uniform layers on flexible web {{at high speed}} with a relatively simple set-up, a combination of slot die pre-metering and carefully controlled web transport. It is different from conventional slot <b>die</b> <b>coating,</b> where the coating gap is maintained by the clearance between backup roll and slot die, in that coating gap is maintained by elastohydrodynamic balance between the tension-resultant force of the curved and tensioned web and the pressure in the coating bead; with this setup much thinner coating gap is made than is possible in conventional slot <b>die</b> <b>coating.</b> For successful operation in tensioned-web coating system, properly designed die is necessary. In conventional slot <b>die</b> <b>coating,</b> pressure profile in the coating bead is well understood and efficiently predicted by considerations based on the one-dimensional viscocapillary model. The model to describe the pressure and gap profiles in tensioned-web slot <b>die</b> <b>coating</b> needs to incorporate {{the interaction between the}} liquid flow and the web deformation, leading to a nonlinear system of equations. In this thesis, coating bead flows and gap profiles in both single-layer and two-layer tensioned-web slot <b>die</b> <b>coating</b> were studied by theoretical model based on shell theory and lubrication approximation, hybridized with two-dimensional flow model when two-dimensional flow model is necessary, and visualization using bench-top web transport system with slot die mounted. The results from visualization and theoretical model study show that a tensioned-web slot <b>die</b> <b>coating</b> die {{can be viewed as a}} combination of component foil bearings. Interpreting the results in this manner, it is easier to predict how the change in die shape and process condition will affect the pressure and gap profiles and therefore easier to design the die shapes required to achieve desired process states, as thin and fast coating, stable two layer coating, or to predict and remove the appearance of microvortexes. By the two-dimensional model on the flow of the two-layer coating, positioning of separation line and appearance of the microvortexes inside the feed slot were studied with the changes in operation condition...|$|E

The effects of anti-solvent introduction and slot <b>die</b> <b>coating</b> process on the device performance, e. g. charge transport, surface morphology, and solid state packing, were investigated in details.

40|$|A <b>coating</b> <b>die</b> is {{used for}} distributing liquid in order to apply a uniform film on a solid surface. The fluid flowing through the die cavity can exert a {{pressure}} of up to 500, 000 Pascal on the die body. This liquid pressure can distort the die and lead to a non-uniform slot opening, which in turn causes non-uniformity in the coating thickness. Distortion of the die can also occur during non-isothermal operation of the die; this is an undesired consequence of delivering liquids at a different temperature than the die itself. The distortions undergone by the die both due to liquid pressure and non-isothermal conditions should be within the manufacturing tolerances for the slot heights {{in order to maintain}} uniformity in the coating. The deformation exhibited by a <b>coating</b> <b>die</b> due to pressure loadings is modeled both two-dimensionally and three-dimensionally. A two-dimensional model has lower computational load and is preferred for die design. For the two-dimensional analysis of a <b>coating</b> <b>die,</b> the finite element method is used to determine the deflections due to pressure loadings with a focus on slot heights. A model of low computational load is also developed based on beam theory, and its results are compared with those of the two-dimensional finite element analyses predictions. The beam model is incorporated in a die design and simulation program in which flow and slot deformations are coupled. Two-dimensional finite element analyses due to non-isothermal conditions are also performed on the <b>coating</b> <b>die</b> to give an estimate of the die deflection due to temperature variations within the <b>die.</b> A three-dimensional <b>coating</b> <b>die</b> with varying inner cavity area is modeled and analyzed to check its predictions with those of the two-dimensional finite element analyses and beam theory results. In the literature reviewed, flow distribution is fully coupled to die deformation only for extrusion dies. Extrusion dies are used for extruding melted polymers of very high viscosity. Therefore, the deflections are much larger for extrusion <b>dies</b> than for <b>coating</b> <b>dies.</b> Mechanical adjustments can be used to manage the large deflections in the case of extrusion <b>dies</b> whereas <b>coating</b> <b>dies</b> have to be designed for small deflections comparable to manufacturing tolerances. This is the first time where a coupled analysis has been done for a <b>coating</b> <b>die.</b> This research provides the slot deflections for a <b>coating</b> <b>die</b> subjected to pressure loadings that vary throughout the die length. The model of flow distribution coupled with die distortion incurs low computational load and is intended for use in design and simulation programs.

40|$|Slot <b>die</b> <b>coating</b> {{technology}} {{is currently the}} most widely used method for production of optical films. The main advantages of this coating method are its ability to pre-determine the product film thickness and to produce uniform film under prolonged operation. In the present study, a laboratory-scale slot <b>die</b> <b>coating</b> equipment was used to investigate the effects of pH, molecular weight and degree of hydrolysis of TiO 2 in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) suspensions on the coating window. Measurements of steady shear viscosity, surface tension, and amount of PVA adsorption on particle surfaces of different suspensions, together with observations of coating bead by means of a flow visualization technique, were used to analyze the coating flow behavior. Changing pH affected the suspension rheology and its stability. Increasing the amount of PVA adsorbed on the TiO 2 surface resulted in an increase in surface tension, which was responsible for the expansion of the coating window or an increase of the maximum coating speed at which flow defects occurred. Four different PVA with varying molecular weight and degree of hydrolysis were used in the suspensions. Higher degrees of hydrolysis resulted in an increase in polymer adsorption, and hence larger surface tension. By contrast, higher molecular weight PVA resulted in a higher viscosity and a smaller surface tension, thus causing air entrainment to occur at a much lower maximum coating speed...|$|E
40|$|The major {{impetus for}} flight {{qualifying}} Chip-On-Board (COB) packaging {{technology is the}} shift in emphasis for space missions to smaller, better, and cheaper spacecraft and satellites resulting from the NASA New Millenium initiative and similar requirements in DoD-sponsored programs. The most important benefit that can potentially be derived from miniaturizing spacecraft and satellites is the significant cost saving realizable if a smaller launch vehicle may be employed. Besides the program cost saving, {{there are several other}} advantages to building COB-based space hardware. First, once a well-controlled process is established, COB can be low cost compared to standard Multi-Chip Module (MCM) technology. This cost competitiveness is regarded {{as a result of the}} generally greater availability and lower cost of Known Good Die (KGD). Coupled with the elimination of the first level of packaging (chip package), compact, high-density circuit boards can be realized with Printed Wiring Boards (PWB) that can now be made with ever-decreasing feature size in line width and via hole. Since the COB packaging technique in this study is based mainly on populating bare dice on a suitable multi-layer laminate substrate which is not hermetically sealed, <b>die</b> <b>coating</b> for protection from the environment is required. In recent years, significant improvements have been made in <b>die</b> <b>coating</b> materials which further enhance the appeal of COB. Hysol epoxies, silicone, parylene and silicon nitride are desirable because of their compatible Thermal Coefficient of Expansion (TCE) and good moisture resistant capability. These <b>die</b> <b>coating</b> materials have all been used in the space and other industries with varying degrees of success. COB technology, specifically siliconnitride coated hardware, has been flown by Lockheed on the Polar satellite. In addition, DARPA has invested a substantial amount of resources on MCM and COB-related activities recently. With COB on the verge of becoming a dominant player in DoD programs, DARPA is increasing its support of the availability of KGDs which will help decrease their cost. Aside from the various major developments and trends in the space and defense industries that are favorable to the acceptance and widespread use of'COB packaging technology, implementing COB can be appealing in other aspects. Since the interconnection interface is usually the weak link in a system, the overall circuit or system reliability may actually be improved because of the elimination of a level of interconnect/packaging at the chip. With COB, mixing packaging technologies is possible. Because some devices are only available in commercial plastic packages, populating a multi-layer laminate substrate with both bare dice and plastic-package parts is inevitable. Another attractive feature of COB is that re-workability is possible if <b>die</b> <b>coating</b> is applied only on the die top. This method allows local replacement of individual dice that were found to be defective instead of replacing an entire board. In terms of thermal management, unpackaged devices offer a shorter thermal resistance path than their packaged counterparts thereby improving thermal sinking and heat removal from the parts...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Casting is {{a process}} where {{components}} are produced by pouring molten metal into moulds or dies which is then allowed to solidify. A variety of casting techniques are used in industry, but this thesis focuses on aluminium casting using a type of permanent mould casting called Gravity Die Casting (GDC). Casting {{is a process}} which is largely dictated by thermal conditions. Thermal conditions dictate solidification rate, which partly determines the microstructure and affects the mechanical properties of a component. Casting parameters such as melt temperature, initial die temperature, and <b>die</b> <b>coating</b> can also affect how heat is removed from a casting. The rate of heat removal is expressed as heat flux (q) (MWm- 2). The rate of heat removal from a casting and through a die is known as interfacial heat flux, and is calculated at the metal/mould boundary. Heat transfer at the metal/mould boundary can also be described by the interfacial Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) (Wm- 2 K- 1). In general if the HTC is large then solidification will be rapid. The HTC {{is a very important}} parameter in casting simulation programs, which are often used to optimise casting processes and die design. For most simulation programs the HTC is required, however, the HTC generally has to be estimated for the particular casting condition being simulated. Current state-of-the-art modelling packages, such as Magmasoft, have the ability to use variable HTCs in computations, but this information is rarely available. The variable HTC plots presented in this thesis provide a valuable database for more accurate modelling the solidification of gravity die cast aluminium-silicon alloys. Aluminum gravity die castings were produced using an experimental gravity die casting rig installed with a Heat Transfer Coefficient gauge. Al- 7 Si- 0. 3 Mg aluminium alloy was used for all castings and two different die coatings were used. A ceramic <b>die</b> <b>coating</b> primarily consisting of titanium dioxide particles in a water suspension, and a graphite <b>die</b> <b>coating</b> were applied to the die using a spray gun with adjustable spray pressure. Two sets of castings were produced with the die set at variable thicknesses of 15 mm, 20 mm and 25 mm, one with the die coated in the ceramic coating and the other with the graphite coating. Castings were produced with the ceramic coating applied at different spray pressures of 2 bar, 4 bar and 6 bar. Heat flux and HTCs were calculated and plotted against time for all castings. The castings of various thicknesses had maximum HTCs in the range of 1. 4 to 1. 5 kWm- 2 K- 1 for castings from the graphite coated die, and 1. 3 to 1. 4 kWm- 2 K- 1 for castings from the ceramic coated die. Heat transfer data for castings from the die coated with ceramic coating applied at spray pressures of 2 bar, 4 bar and 6 bar were also plotted and analysed. It was found that the castings from the die coated at 4 bar had the highest HTC of 1. 3 kWm- 2 K- 1, with the 2 bar and 6 bar castings only reaching maximum HTCs of approximately 1. 0 kWm- 2 K- 1 and 1. 1 kWm- 2 K- 1, respectively. Microstructures from castings were also analysed with dendrite cell sizes and eutectic volume fraction measurements taken. This information was then compared to the HTC data and solidification times in order to establish links between heat transfer, maximum HTC and the resultant microstructures. Significant variations in the HTC are likely to occur as results of normal processes in commercial foundries. This thesis provides an idea of how much the absolute value of the HTC varies with changes in some typical parameters. From this knowledge a robust casting process can be designed to tolerate these typical changes in the HTC...|$|E

For the photoactive layer the non-halogenated solvent o-Xylene was used {{in order to reduce}} the impact on health and environment for R 2 R coating on ambient atmospheric conditions. The Cr–Al–Cr layers were sputtered onto the PET rolls in a batch process while the photoactive layer as well as the hole transport layer were applied in a continuous R 2 R process by slot <b>die</b> <b>coating.</b> The Ag grid was either thermally evaporated through a shadow mask as reference process or deposited by aerosol printing as a more production compatible process. Device efficiencies up to 2. 9 % on an active area of 1. 1 cm 2 were obtained with no difference for the method of grid processing. These experimental results demonstrate that R 2 R coated organic functional layers in ITO-free devices obtain the same device performance as compared to spin coated laboratory cells...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research program was to design and develop an optimal coating system that extends die life by minimizing premature die failure. In high-pressure aluminum die-casting, the die, core pins and inserts must withstand severe processing conditions. Many of the dies and tools in the industry are being coated to improve wear-resistance and decrease down-time for maintenance. However, thermal fatigue in metal itself can still be a major problem, especially since it often leads to catastrophic failure (i. e. die breakage) {{as opposed to a}} wear-based failure (parts begin to go out of tolerance). Tooling costs remain the largest portion of production costs for many of these parts, so the ability prevent catastrophic failures would be transformative for the manufacturing industry. The technology offers energy savings through reduced energy use in the die casting process from several factors, including increased life of the tools and dies, reuse of the dies and die components, reduction/elimination of lubricants, and reduced machine down time, and reduction of Al solder sticking on the die. The use of the optimized <b>die</b> <b>coating</b> system will also reduce environmental wastes and scrap parts. Current (2012) annual energy saving estimates, based on initial dissemination to the casting industry in 2010 and market penetration of 80 % by 2020, is 3. 1 trillion BTU's/year. The average annual estimate of CO 2 reduction per year through 2020 is 0. 63 Million Metric Tons of Carbon Equivalent (MM TCE) ...|$|E
40|$|Coating of particle-fluid dispersions is {{very common}} in the {{manufacturing}} of functional materials, whose quality depends on the uniform distribution of the suspended functional particles.

40|$|In this paper, {{thermal cycling}} {{reliability}} along with ANSYS {{analysis of the}} residual stress generated in heavy-gauge Al bond wires at different bonding temperatures is reported. 99. 999 % pure Al wires of 375 mum in diameter, were ultrasonically bonded to silicon <b>dies</b> <b>coated</b> with a 5 mum thick Al metallisation at 25 degC (room temperature), 100 degC and 200 degC, respectively (with the same bonding parameters). The wire bonded samples were then subjected to thermal cycling in air from - 60 degC to + 150 degC. The degradation rate of the wire bonds was assessed by means of bond shear test and via microstructural characterisation. Prior to thermal cycling, the shear strength {{of all of the}} wire bonds was approximately equal to the shear strength of pure aluminum and independent of bonding temperature. During thermal cycling, however, the shear strength of room temperature bonded samples was observed to decrease more rapidly (as compared to bonds formed at 100 degC and 200 degC) {{as a result of a}} high crack propagation rate across the bonding area. In addition, modification of the grain structure at the bonding interface was also observed with bonding temperature, leading to changes in the mechanical properties of the wire. The heat and pressure induced by the high temperature bonding is believed to promote grain recovery and recrystallisation, softening the wires through removal of the dislocations and plastic strain energy. Coarse grains formed at the bonding interface after bonding at elevated temperatures may also contribute to greater resistance for crack propagation, thus lowering the wire bond degradation rat...|$|R
40|$|In {{aluminium}} extrusion, {{the life}} of the die tooling components is mainly limited by wear and fatigue. Therefore reliable predictions of the amount of wear and its distribution in dies are important factors for the die design. In this study the stress location and wear depth of the tooling components were calculated using finite element models incorporating the Archards wear model. A comparative study was conducted on an extrusion <b>die</b> without <b>coating</b> and with a bilayer (TiCN + Al 2 O 3) chemical vapor deposition (CVD) coating. Stress distribution and the amount of wear were calculated. The results generated from the simulation would help predict the service life of the components through optimizing coating thickness...|$|R
