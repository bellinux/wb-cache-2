The Crew's ownership believed that Schmid {{had been in}} contact with Sounders FC despite being denied permission to talk to other teams during the season. It was also alleged that he shared confidential information with Seattle after his contract with the Crew had ended. The MLS ruled that no tampering had occurred, but ordered Sounders FC to financially compensate the Crew.|$|E
5|$|Johnston decided upon {{a course}} of action that {{forfeited}} the initiative across most of his defensive line, tacitly admitting that the Confederate defensive strategy for Tennessee was a sham. On February 7, at a council of war held in the Covington Hotel at Bowling Green, he decided to abandon western Kentucky by withdrawing Beauregard <b>from</b> <b>Columbus,</b> evacuating Bowling Green, and moving his forces south of the Cumberland River at Nashville. Despite his misgivings about its defensibility, Johnston agreed to Beauregard's advice that he should reinforce Fort Donelson with another 12,000 men, knowing that a defeat there would mean the inevitable loss of Middle Tennessee and the vital manufacturing and arsenal city of Nashville.|$|E
5|$|The airport opened July 8, 1929, {{on a site}} {{selected}} by Charles Lindbergh, as the eastern air terminus of the Transcontinental Air Transport air-rail New York to Los Angeles transcontinental route.

5|$|The government's {{financial}} woes also continued. Hawes {{was embarrassed}} {{to admit that}} neither he nor anyone else seemed to know what became of approximately $45,000 that had been sent <b>from</b> <b>Columbus</b> to Memphis, Tennessee during the Confederate occupation of Kentucky. Another major blow was Davis' 1864 decision not to allow Hawes to spend $1 million that had been secretly appropriated in August 1861 to help Kentucky maintain its neutrality. Davis reasoned that the money could not be spent for its intended purpose, since Kentucky had already been admitted to the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|Following the German Army's {{invasion}} of Poland and {{the outbreak of}} World War II in Europe in September 1939, the U.S. military entered a period of mobilization, and Patton sought {{to build up the}} power of U.S. armored forces. During maneuvers the Third Army conducted in 1940, Patton served as an umpire, where he met Adna R. Chaffee Jr. and the two formulated recommendations to develop an armored force. Chaffee was named commander of this force, and created the 1st and 2nd Armored Divisions as well as the first combined arms doctrine. He named Patton commander of the 2nd Armored Brigade, part of the 2nd Armored Division. The division was one of few organized as a heavy formation with many tanks, and Patton was in charge of its training. Patton was promoted to brigadier general on October 2, made acting division commander in November, and on April 4, 1941 was promoted again to major general and made Commanding General (CG) of the 2nd Armored Division. As Chaffee stepped down from command of the I Armored Corps, Patton became the most prominent figure in U.S. armor doctrine. In December 1940, he staged a high-profile mass exercise in which 1,000 tanks and vehicles were driven <b>from</b> <b>Columbus,</b> Georgia, to Panama City, Florida, and back. He repeated the exercise with his entire division of 1,300 vehicles the next month. Patton earned a pilot's license and, during these maneuvers, observed the movements of his vehicles from the air to find ways to deploy them effectively in combat. His exploits earned him a spot on the cover of Life Magazine.|$|E

25|$|The Columbus, Piqua and Indiana Railroad was {{chartered}} in Ohio on February 23, 1849, {{to build}} <b>from</b> <b>Columbus</b> west via Urbana, Piqua and Greenville to the Indiana state line.

The first section, <b>from</b> <b>Columbus</b> west to Plain City, opened June 6, 1853. Extensions opened to Urbana September 19 and Piqua October 16, 1854; on the latter date it changed its rail gauge to Ohio gauge {{to connect with the}} Indianapolis and Bellefontaine, which had also re-gauged. The rest of the line to Union City opened March 25, 1859, after some financial problems. The CP was sold at foreclosure on August 6, 1863, and reorganized October 30 as the Columbus and Indianapolis Railroad.|$|E

Forrest proved to be a scourge to the Union Army in western Kentucky, even making an attack on Paducah.

The Columbus and Bellefontaine railroad was incorporated in 1878 and had station points in the county at Marysville.

General Albert Sidney Johnston, commander of all Confederate forces in the West, sent General Simon Bolivar Buckner of Kentucky to invade Bowling Green, Kentucky. Union forces in Kentucky saw Buckner's move toward Bowling Green as the beginning of a massive attack on Louisville. With twenty thousand troops, Johnston established a defensive line stretching <b>from</b> <b>Columbus</b> in western Kentucky to the Cumberland Gap, controlled by Confederate General Felix Zollicoffer.|$|E
