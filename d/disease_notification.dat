50|$|The Infectious <b>Disease</b> (<b>Notification)</b> Act first {{appeared}} on the UK national statute books in 1889. It was compulsory in London and optional {{in the rest of}} the country. It later became a mandatory law with the Infectious Diseases Notification (Extension) Act, 1899. These acts required householders and/or general practitioners to report cases of infectious disease to the local sanitary authority. The following diseases were covered by the acts: smallpox, cholera, diphtheria, membranous croup. erysipelas, scarlatina or scarlet fever, typhus fever, typhoid fever, enteric fever, relapsing fever, continued fever and puerperal fever. Householders or general practitioners who failed to notify a case of one of these diseases was liable to a fine of up to forty shillings.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the first}} points {{to be dealt with}} in 1897 was to settle the {{incubation}} period for this disease, and the period to be adopted for administrative purposes. It was admitted that the incubation period was, as a rule, a comparatively short one, namely, of some three or four days. After much discussion ten days was accepted by a very large majority. The principle of <b>disease</b> <b>notification</b> was unanimously adopted. Each government had to notify to other governments on the existence of plague within their several jurisdictions, {{and at the same time}} state the measures of prevention which are being carried out to prevent its diffusion. The area deemed to be infected was limited to the actual district or village where the disease prevailed, and no locality was deemed to be infected merely because of the importation into it of a few cases of plague while there has been no diffusion of the malady. As regards the precautions to be taken on land frontiers, it was decided that during the prevalence of plague every country had the inherent right to close its land frontiers against traffic. As regards the Red Sea, it was decided after discussion that a healthy vessel could pass through the Suez Canal, and continue its voyage in the Mediterranean during the period of incubation of the disease the prevention of which is in question. It was also agreed that vessels passing through the Canal in quarantine might, subject to the use of the electric light, coal in quarantine at Port Said by night as well as by day, and that passengers might embark in quarantine at that port. Infected vessels, if these carry a doctor and are provided with a disinfecting stove, have a right to navigate the Canal, in quarantine, subject only to the landing of those who were suffering from plague.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} {{and spread}} of infectious disease {{are a major}} issue associated with environmental change. Contributing to this is the effect climate variability and change may play in altering disease risk. The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate the association between climate and infectious diseases in humans throughout New Zealand from 1997 - 2007, then use the identified associations to project the burden of disease in 2015, 2040 and 2090 with respect to future climate change scenarios. The four infectious diseases selected and investigated were campylobacteriosis, cryptosporidiosis, influenza hospitalisations and meningococcal disease. The association of weather variables and other confounders with the incidence risk (IR) of disease were explored using a quasi-Poisson generalized linear model, indicating that weather variables were significantly associated with disease risk. These results, along with expert opinion on epidemiological plausibility, were used to select confounders for the past association models. Climate variation was associated with the IR of campylobacteriosis and cryptosporidiosis in New Zealand from 1997 - 2007. Campylobacteriosis notifications were found to be positively associated with the weekly absolute humidity. Additionally, campylobacteriosis notification risk factors were increasing beef and dairy density, intermediate and poor drinking water quality, being over 65 years of age and identifying with Pacific Island or Asian ethnicity. Protective factors were being less than 4 years of age and identifying with Maori ethnicity. Cryptosporidiosis notifications were found to be positively associated with the weekly average temperature and negatively associated with the weekly average rainfall. Risk factors for cryptosporidiosis notifications were poor drinking water quality, being less than 4 years of age and living in rural areas. Protective factors were identifying with Maori ethnicity and unknown drinking water quality. Influenza hospitalisations and meningococcal <b>disease</b> <b>notifications</b> were not significantly associated with past climate variation. Identifying with Maori ethnicity was found to be a risk factor for influenza hospitalisations, with no protective factors identified. Risk factors for meningococcal <b>disease</b> <b>notifications</b> were an increasing social deprivation index (SDI) score, being less than 4 years of age and identifying with Maori ethnicity. Identifying with Asian ethnicity was a protective factor for meningococcal disease. The projection calculations of the change in disease incidence from the study period to 2015, 2040 and 2090 were carried out under a combination 3 Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) climate scenarios (A 2, B 1 and A 1 B) and 12 downscaled global climate models.

DESIGN [...] The study design was descriptive. SUBJECTS [...] The population resident in the city of Madrid. MAIN RESULTS [...] There was a high correlation between the cases notified to the compulsory <b>disease</b> <b>notification</b> system and those listed by the sentinel network (r = 0. 91, p < 0. 001, r 2 = 0. 82). The epidemic activity during the period 1991 - 92 was centred approximately on week 48 in 1991 and week 6 in 1992 (24 November 1991 - 8 February 1992). Altogether 913 cases of influenza were notified through the sentinel network. The greatest number of cases occurred in people aged between 20 and 39 years. CONCLUSION [...] For the epidemiological surveillance of influenza it is necessary to develop systems that can quickly detect epidemic periods and provide information about populations at risk, in addition to systems that isolate and identify seasonal epidemic viruses. Both types of data will help the development of adequate public health policies. Sentinel networks provide these data and offer additional advantages such as lower cost...|$|E

MethodsWe used the Global Burden of Diseases 2010 (GBD 2010) methodology to estimate the country-level burden of disease in KSA. We used data from systematic reviews of the literature, household survey data, antenatal clinic surveillance data, reportable <b>disease</b> <b>notifications,</b> <b>disease</b> registries, hospital admissions data, outpatient visit data, population-based cancer registries, active screening data, and other administrative data. ResultsNoncommunicable diseases and road traffic injuries became {{the leading cause of}} death and disability in KSA in 2010. Elevated body mass index was the leading risk factor for disease (7. 02 % for males and 4. 61 % for females in 2010). High glucose levels were the second leading disease risk factor for females (3. 28 %) and third for males (6. 25 %) in 2010. Preterm birth complications were the main cause for DALYs in 1990; however, in 2010, the leading cause of DALYs for males was road traffic injuries (12. 40 %) and for females it was major depressive disorder (7. 88 %). ConclusionKSA is facing a rising burden of noncommunicable diseases and road traffic injuries as a result of rapid changes in behaviors.

40|$|Abstract Background Routinely {{collected}} {{infectious disease}} surveillance data provide a valuable means {{to monitor the}} health of populations. Notifiable disease surveillance systems in Australia have consistently reported high levels of completeness for the demographic data fields of age and sex, but low levels of completeness for Aboriginality data. Significant amounts of missing data associated with case notifications can introduce bias in the estimation of disease rates by population subgroups. The aim of this analysis was {{to evaluate the use}} of data linkage to improve the accuracy of estimated notification rates for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and blood borne viruses (BBVs) in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal groups in Western Australia. Methods Probabilistic methods were used to link <b>disease</b> <b>notification</b> data received in Western Australia in 2004 with core population health datasets from the established Western Australian Data Linkage System. A comparative descriptive analysis of STI and BBV notification rates according to Aboriginality was conducted based on the original and supplemented notification datasets. Results Using data linkage, the proportion of STI and BBV notifications with missing Aboriginality data was reduced by 74 per cent. Compared with excluding notifications with unknown Aboriginality data from the analysis, or apportioning notifications with unknown Aboriginality based on the proportion of cases with known Aboriginality, the rate ratios of chlamydia, syphilis and hepatitis C among Aboriginal relative to non-Aboriginal people decreased when Aboriginality data from data linkage was included.

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} whether under-reporting of rheumatic fever occurs at hospital, municipal, provincial {{and national levels}} of the South African health system. Background. Information on the incidence of rheumatic fever (RF) and the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease (RHD) {{is required for the}} prevention of valvular heart disease in developing countries. In South Africa, RF was made a notifiable condition in 1989. It has recently been suggested that the reporting of RF cases may be incomplete, possibly because of underreporting by health care professionals and deficient administration of the <b>disease</b> <b>notification</b> system in South Africa. Method and results. We assessed whether underreporting of RF cases occurs by comparing the numbers of RF cases reported per year at hospital, municipal, provincial and national levels from 1990 to 2004. There was a fall in the number of RF cases reported per year at national and provincial level over the 15 years of observation. A detailed analysis of the number of RF cases reported at hospital, municipal and provincial level for a 5 -year period showed that more cases were diagnosed in one hospital (serving a smaller population) than were captured at municipal and provincial level (serving a larger population), suggesting underreporting by health care professionals. There were discrepancies in the number of cases reported at municipal, provincial and national level, suggesting poor administration of the notification system. Conclusion. There appears to be underreporting of RF cases by health care professionals, and poor administration of the RF notification system. Health care professionals need to be educated about the statutory requirement to notify all RF cases in South Africa.

Materials and method: A total of 141 nurses {{who participated in the}} seminar on breast cancer nursing were enrolled in this study. The questionnaire consisted of the occupational backgrounds of the nurses, and 35 contents that nurses want to learn in breast cancer nursing. We examined the degree of desire to learn each content and the relationship between occupational backgrounds and 35 contents of learning using a 5 -point scoring system. Results: More than half of nurses strongly wanted to learn all of 35 contents. The majority of nurses wanted to learn the contents of nursing skills on <b>disease</b> <b>notification,</b> and nursing skills for psychological response. On the other hand, nurses did not want to learn the contents of consulting in support for sexual activity and nursing skills related to pregnancy and child birth. Nurses with experience of breast cancer nursing for less than 3 years wanted to learn the contents of chemotherapy and endocrine therapy more than those for over 3 years (P< 0. 05).

Data linkage can be effectively used to improve the accuracy of estimated <b>disease</b> <b>notification</b> rates...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} the epidemiology of selected vaccine-preventable diseases in New South Wales, Australia for 2013. Methods: Data from the New South Wales Notifiable Conditions Information Management System were analysed by local health district of residence, age, Aboriginality, vaccination status and organism. Risk factor and vaccination status {{data were collected}} by public health units. Results: Pertussis notification rates in infants were low, and no infant pertussis deaths were reported. Despite {{a high number of}} imported measles cases, there was limited secondary transmission. The invasive meningococcal <b>disease</b> <b>notification</b> rate declined, and disease due to serogroup C remained low and stable. Conclusion: Vaccine-preventable diseases were relatively well controlled in New South Wales in 2013, with declining or stable notification rates in most diseases compared with the previous year...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} impact of {{introducing}} a publicly funded infant rotavirus vaccination program on <b>disease</b> <b>notifications</b> and on laboratory testing and results. Design and setting: Retrospective analysis of routinely collected data (rotavirus notifications [2006 - 2008] and laboratory rotavirus testing data from Queensland Health laboratories [2000 - 2008]) to monitor rotavirus trends before and after the introduction of a publicly funded infant rotavirus vaccination program in Queensland in July 2007. Main outcome measures: Age group-specific rotavirus notification trends; number of rotavirus tests performed and the proportion positive. Results: In the less than 2 years age group, rotavirus notifications declined by 53 % (2007) and 65 % (2008); the number of laboratory tests performed declined by 3 % (2007) and 15 % (2008); and the proportion of tests positive declined by 45 % (2007) and 43 % (2008) compared with data collected before introduction of the vaccination program. An indirect effect of infant vaccination was seen: notifications and the proportion of tests positive for rotavirus declined in older age groups as well. Conclusions: The publicly funded rotavirus vaccination program in Queensland is having an early impact, direct and indirect, on rotavirus disease as assessed using routinely collected data. Further observational studies are required to assess vaccine effectiveness. Parents and immunisation providers should ensure that all Australian children receive the recommended rotavirus vaccine doses in the required timeframe. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{tuberculosis}} (TB) incidence {{has been}} decreasing in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) {{in the last}} decades, specific subgroups of the population, such as migrants, remain {{at high risk of}} TB. This study is based on the report ‘Key Infectious Diseases in Migrant Populations in the EU/EEA’ commissioned by The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Methods: We collected, critically appraised and summarized the available evidence on the TB burden in migrants in the EU/EEA. Data were collected through: (i) a comprehensive literature review; (ii) analysis of data from The European Surveillance System (TESSy) and (iii) evidence provided by TB experts during an infectious disease workshop in 2012. Results: In 2010, of the 73 996 TB cases notified in the EU/EEA, 25 % were of foreign origin. The overall decrease of TB cases observed in recent years has not been reflected in migrant populations. Foreign-born people with TB exhibit different socioeconomic and clinical characteristics than native sufferers. Conclusion: This {{is one of the first}} studies to use multiple data sources, including the largest available European database on infectious <b>disease</b> <b>notifications,</b> to assess the burden and provide a comprehensive description and analysis of specific TB features in migrants in the EU/EEA. Strengthened information about health determinants and factors for migrants’ vulnerability is needed to plan, implement and evaluate targeted TB care and control interventions for migrants in the EU/EEA...|$|R
