40|$|This report {{describes}} the non-nulling calibration of a 13; typical, two dimensional, combination wedge probe used in 13; turbo machinery testing and analysis the calibration 13; characteristics in detail. The calibration {{was carried out}} in a 0;lm x 0. 2 5 m cross-section Induction Tunnel over a subsonic Mach number range of 0. 1 i M lt;: 0. 7 and a yaw angle range of -FA to + 20. Calibration data has been plotted in terms of non dimensional parameters composed of true total and static pressures and the pressures read by the probe orifices. A procedure, based upon the successive Iteration among the calibration curves, is described. for obtaining the t. rue flow 1 x 2019;. parameters from the measured probe pressures in an unknown flow field. x 2019; BASIC x 2019; language programmes and subroutines, which run on MACSYM 150 desk-top computer and a NPS- 6 digital <b>intelligent</b> <b>plotter</b> are explained for. plotting the calibration parameters, polynomial curve fitting and for computing the true flow parameters...|$|E
