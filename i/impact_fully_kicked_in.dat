5000|$|Wilson {{gives in}} to Tucker's plea(after seeing how {{the man had}} reunited with his estranged family {{in light of his}} dire situation) and plans {{to go ahead with the}} {{operation}} to donate a portion of his liver to Tucker. Before the operation, Wilson asks House to be there for the operation. House, showcasing a rare moment of vulnerability, initially refuses by revealing to Wilson that [...] "If you die, I'm alone". At the operation, as Wilson is being anaesthetised, he sees House at the viewing area and smiles just before the anaesthetic <b>fully</b> <b>kicks</b> <b>in.</b> After the operation however, Tucker reveals that now that he's going to live, he is summarily casting his family aside again to pursue a love interest almost the same age as his own daughter. Wilson contains his reaction, but it's clear that his view of Tucker is now similar to House's.|$|R
5000|$|Nerdly gave The Sleeping Room a four star {{review and}} wrote [...] "A superb example of modern British horror, The Sleeping Room, like fellow Frightfest movie The Forgotten, marks a new bright future for genre filmmaking in the UK that, {{in a perfect}} world, would {{be held in the}} same esteem as Hammer’s {{prolific}} output." [...] Anton Bitel of Grolsch Film Works also praised The Sleeping Room, stating [...] "Once the possessions and ghostly manifestations have <b>fully</b> <b>kicked</b> <b>in,</b> it all becomes a little Punch and Judy ... but The Sleeping Room works best as an incestuous love letter to Brighton and the town's darker, ever-present history." [...] Shock Till You Drop gave a mixed review for The Sleeping Room, writing [...] "While the leads are appealing and Fiskin is very creepy looking, the mystery fails to deliver suspense or scares. The snuff films are meant to terrify, but they are more silly than scary as glimpsed through an old machine. And the conclusion, a dragged out chase and showdown in the old building, is perfunctory and fairly dull, making a short movie feel much longer than it actually is." [...] Others were more critical such as Top 10 Films which, in its one-star review, praised the performance of actress Leila Mimmack but felt the film was handicapped by a convoluted script that contained [...] "one-note characters" [...] and a reliance on [...] "horror tropes". It wrote: [...] "John Shackleton never knows whether to stick or twist leaving The Sleeping Room engaging the wrong gears like a premature learner driver behind the wheel for the first time." ...|$|R
60|$|He did {{not move}} for at least ten minutes, while the clamour of the city vibrated through the silent room, and when his first anger passed away became {{sensible}} of a great pity for the girl who had risked so much for him. It appeared only too probable {{that because of the}} modicum of truth it was founded on the lie would stick to both of them, and now when it was too late Alton regretted his folly. He had been <b>fully</b> justified <b>in</b> <b>kicking</b> Cartier out of his rooms, but he knew that everything that is legitimate is not advisable, and groaned as he saw what the story must cost the defenceless girl who had a living to earn and her father to maintain. There was so far as he could see no way out of the difficulty yet--and the one that concerned himself was almost as formidable, for he knew Alice Deringham's pride, and the damning fact remained that he could not deny the whole story.|$|R
