25|$|The {{method used}} to read NANDflash memory can cause nearby cells in the same memory block to change over time (become programmed). This is known as read disturb. The {{threshold}} number of reads is generally {{in the hundreds of}} thousands of reads between intervening erase operations. If reading continually from one cell, that cell will not fail but rather one of the surrounding cells on a subsequent read. To avoid the read disturb problem the flash controller will typically count the total number of reads to a block since the last erase. When the count exceeds a target limit, the affected block is copied over to a new block, erased, then released to the block pool. The original block is as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>new</b> after the erase. If the flash controller does not intervene in time, however, a read disturb error will occur with possible data loss if the errors are too numerous to correct with an error-correcting code.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1950s, Leo Margulies, a {{well-known}} {{figure in the}} magazine publishing world, launched a new company, Renown Publications, with plans to publish several titles. [...] He acquired the rights to both Weird Tales and Short Stories, and hoped to bring both magazines back. [...] He abandoned a plan to restart Weird Tales in 1962, using reprints from the original magazine, after being advised by Sam Moskowitz {{that there was little}} market for weird and horror fiction at the time. [...] Instead Margulies mined the Weird Tales backfile for four anthologies which appeared in the early 1960s: The Unexpected, The Ghoul-Keepers, Weird Tales, and Worlds of Weird. [...] The latter two were ghost-edited by Moskowitz, who proposed to Margulies that when the time was right to start the magazine up again, it should include reprints from obscure sources that Moskowitz had found, rather than just stories reprinted from the first incarnation of Weird Tales. [...] These stories would be as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>new</b> for most readers, and the money saved could be used for an occasional new story.|$|E

[...] In what has become a classic occurrence, Bill often manages to knock {{one or both of the}} side mirrors off the van. He can also store large tools and miscellaneous items in his overalls, and pull them out on demand. Many segments show Bill getting hurt somehow, but apparently not seriously or permanently. (One segment in particular ends with Bill's arms crushed and flattened in a grape press.)

Also, the labeling time for the NP–Containment scheme (that is, P–Containment combined with the New labeling scheme in order of contextualization) is <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>New’s</b> time. However, notice that the P–Containment method has to relabel all nodes when new nodes are inserted. IBSL manipulates longer node labels as it stores the label of the parent (hence the label of its ancestors) of an intended node in addition to SelfID. Therefore, this method requires much more time for the labeling process. Considering all the datasets, the New method generates required labels almost 12.74 times faster than IBSL.|$|R
