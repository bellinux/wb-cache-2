In response, discard sampling in the Belgian beam trawl fishery is carried out by sea-going observers since 2003, but is mainly focused on commercially valuable fishes. From 2007, the research project TOETS prepares {{the extension of the}} data collection programme towards commercially unimportant fish species and non-fish organisms. Four sampling trips were undertaken on Belgian beam trawlers in the TOETS framework so far (October 2007 -January 2008). Both volume and composition of the discards were studied for different parts of the North Sea and the English Channel. In two trips, <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> (among the various factors influencing the amount of discarded organisms in a catch) was manipulated {{on one side of the}} fishing vessel to evaluate potential reductions in discard yields through technical adaptations.

The variability in volume and composition of discards (primarily changing with fishing vessel, geographic region and period of the year), and in commercial yield-to-discard ratios is illustrated.

40|$|We {{reviewed}} {{the literature on}} incidental catches of pinnipeds by commercial fisheries using both passive and active fishing gear. Few incidental catch data were available for most species, although {{a substantial amount of}} information has recently become available for species in the North Pacific Ocean and the Northwest Atlantic Ocean off Eastern Canada. Incidental catches in passive gear appear to be of sufficient magnitude to have contributed to population declines of northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and Kuril seals (Phoca vitulina stejnegeri) in the North Pacific and harp seals (P. groenlandica) from the Barents Sea. Incidental catches in active gear appear at least partially responsible for the decline of northern sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) in the North Pacific. Detrimental impacts of incidental catches are also indicated for New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri) off the Auckland Islands, harbour seals (P. vitulina concolor) off Newfoundland and Alaska, grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in the eastern Baltic and for endangered Mediterranean (Monachus monachus) and Hawaiian (M. schauinslandi) monk seals. Several factors appear to influence incidental catches of pinnipeds, including behavioural traits of individual species, age of individuals, <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>type,</b> and the temporal and spatial overlap of a species' range with fishing activities. More and better data on incidental catches of marine mammals (pinnipeds and cetaceans) and sea-birds by individual fisheries are required in order to evaluate properly the magnitude of the problems and their potential impact on specific populations...|$|E
40|$|One of {{potential}} fishing grounds for small pelagic fish in Southeast Mallucas Regency is Rosenberg Strait waters. In this region, {{a study on}} the effect of different light intensities of floating lift net on fish catches was carried out. The analyses were done on light distribution of 4 light intensities different: Petromaks Lamp and Underwater Lamps of each 18 watt, 36 watt and 54 watt. This study showed that catches of floating lift net using different light intensities were statistically significantly different. The use of 36 watt and 54 watt underwater lamp yielded the same amount of catches but higher than that of 18 watt-underwater lamp and petromaks, both in number and species. Catches consisted of 17 species, 16 fishs and 1 mollusca. Number of species and size also varied with light intensity used. There were 13 fishs species dominated by Stolephorus indicus as much as 46. 9 kg or 22 % for petromaks catches, 14 fishs species dominated by Rastrelliger kanagurata as much as 64 kg (31 %) for 18 watt underwater lamp, 17 fishs species dominated by Rastrelliger kanagurata as much as 76 kg (28 %) for 36 watt underwater lamp, and 15 fishs species dominated by Stolephorus devisi as much as 54. 8 kg (22 %) for 54 watt underwater lamp, respectively. Based on the results, it is recommended that the use of light intensity in fishing operations of floating lift net should be 36 watt and 54 watt underwater lamps, due to high catches, both in number and species.

Predictions of the survival of discarded fish are dependent on understanding how a fish responds to stressful conditions. Our objective was to describe the immunological health of sablefish exposed to capture stressors. In laboratory experiments designed to simulate the capture process, we subjected sablefish to various stressors that might influence survival: Towing in a net, hooking, elevated seawater and air temperatures, and air exposure time. After stress was imposed, the in vitro mitogen-stimulated proliferation of sablefish leukocytes {{was used to evaluate}} the function of the immune system in an assay we validated for this species.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, is a {{valuable}} North Pacific Ocean species caught in several commercial fisheries and is often discarded due to size or catch limits. Managers must account for the mortality of discarded fish to assess fish populations and harvest impacts, yet discard mortality rates of specific fisheries are generally unknown. Delayed mortality is one source of undetected mortality in discarded fish. The observance of delayed mortality in discards during laboratory and field studies suggest that capture stressors may induce physiological modifications that result indirectly in future mortality from stress and/or disease. Since {{the imposition of a}} stressor disrupts a fish's capability to maintain immunological function, understanding the capacity of the immune system to function after an acute bycatch stressor may be important in assessing the survival of discarded fish and further understanding the mechanisms behind delayed mortality. The main objective {{of this study was to}} describe the immunological health of sablefish exposed to capture stressors. First, experiments were performed to obtain the conditions necessary for [³H]-thymidine incorporation into lymphocytes sensitive to B and T cell mitogens. Then, in laboratory experiments designed to simulate the capture process, sablefish were subjected to various stressors that may influence survival: towing in a net, hooking, ecologically relevant temperatures of seawater and air, and air exposure time. Following the imposition of stress, the immunological assay was used to assess immune function. The results demonstrated that regardless of <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>type,</b> exposure to elevated seawater temperatures or air times, [³H]-thymidine incorporation into leukocytes from stressed sablefish was significantly diminished in response to the T cell mitogen concanavalin A or the B cell mitogen lipopolysaccharide. Seawater or air temperatures were not found to significantly influence immune responses. The duration and severity of the capture stressors applied in our study were sufficient to induce significantly elevated levels of cortisol and glucose. However, there was no difference in the magnitude of plasma cortisol and glucose responses among stress treatments. These data suggest that immunological suppression occurs in sablefish subjected to capture-related stressors. Functional impairment of the immune system after exposure to capture-related stress is a potential reason for delayed mortality in discarded sablefish. As fishes are returned to the ocean, their ability to perform at the whole organism level may be diminished for an extended period of time and the cumulative strain from maintaining physiological adaptation can reduce their ability to sustain normal immunological functions. Consequently, immunological impairment may predispose a discarded fish to disease and eventual death. However, further studies are needed to determine if delayed mortality in discarded sablefish can be caused by increased susceptibility to infectious agents resulting from stress-mediated immunosuppression...|$|E

Ephippion guttifer, Chaetodipterus goreensis, Sardinella maderensis, Sardinella aurita, Liza falcipinnis, Mugil bananensis, Pentanemus quinquarius, Polydactylus quadrafilis and Trichuris lepturis were common. Ethmalosa fimbriata, Liza grandisquamis, Sphyraena guachancho, Mugil curema, Sphyraena guachancho and Dormitator pleurops were abundant. None was dominant. The highest number of fish species (16) were recorded in fish town and none was recorded in Kuloma 1 and one (1) was recorded for Kulauma 11. Foroupa, Ekeni, Ejetu and Ikebiri fishing port 1 and 2 recorded 8, 7, 3 and 5 fish species respectively. Artisanal fishing is based on traditional methods of fishing using essentially canoe and different fishing nets which depend on the season and target fish species. Canoes may be motorized or hand-paddled. Common gear types include shrimp traps, drift gill nets, set gill nets, cast nets, seine nets, hook and lines. Lift nets may be use by women folk who target small shrimp species in the creeks and creek lets. Other fishing methods include hand-picking for periwinkles, oysters and other shellfish by women folk and children. Prominent among the fishing devices are edek, a type of fish fence used in the creeks; alot, a large trap used on sand and mud-banks in the estuaries; and otunwa, a barbed spear. Fishers using these devices either operated from their home villages, exploiting the nearby waters, or staged long distance fishing expeditions, during which they lived in distant camps or house-boats.

It was near the median of harvests for the past decade. For some species in some regions the harvest in 2009 was predominantly of hatchery-origin salmon (e. g. Prince William Sound pink salmon, Southeast chum salmon) {{but most of the}} harvest depended on locally-managed fisheries dependent on naturally-reproducing salmon in healthy ecosystems. Managers of some local area fisheries suspect that a trend over several recent years toward smaller body size may be occurring (e. g. chum salmon in northern part of Southeast; pink salmon in Southeast.) Marine Stewardship Council Ecolabel. The Alaska salmon fishery was certified Sustainable in 2000 and recertified in 2007 for five years by the Council. Thus salmon harvested in Alaska have been able to carry the MSC sustainability ecolabel in the marketplace. A single certification, applying to all salmon harvested in all parts of Alaska, was sought by Alaska Department of Fish and Game because the market would have been confused by multiple certifications of multiple fisheries for multiple species. Certification applies to all five species harvested in any of the waters of Alaska. The five species are divided into 16 Units in the certification process which evaluates each Unit in certifying the entire fishery. Each Unit is a different regulatory Area or a combination of <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> and Area. Continued Certification is dependent on successful annual surveillance audits by an agent of the Council. The auditors require detailed reports from the Client each year. The Client for the certification process, Alaska Department of Fish & Game, has withdrawn from the process as of May 2009. This means that Alaska salmon harvested before November 2009 can be marketed with the MSC certification ecolabel but if surveillance audits are not provided by a new Client the certification may lapse. It is possible that Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute will undertake the responsibilities of the MSC Client. Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute.

40|$|Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) {{and blue}} shark (Prionace glauca) are two apex predators in the pelagic {{ecosystem}} {{of the eastern}} Mediterranean Sea. Our current knowledge on their spatio-temporal distribution patterns and {{the effect that the}} surrounding environment has on them is limited. During the period of 1998 - 2001 and 2003 - 2005, data gathered from a series of surveys on the Greek surface drifting longline fleet were analyzed in order to estimate the effect of spatial, temporal, environmental and operational factors on the abovementioned species distribution and relative abundance (expressed in number of fish caught per 1000 hooks deployed). Application of generalized additive models allowed the identification of various parameters influencing catches as well as the contribution of each one. The optimum model was derived using a cross validation procedure which was based on the principal of parsimony: this principal tends to select those variables that depict more closely the actual trends than those that fit best the underlying dataset. Three sets were investigated for swordfish: (i) all specimens; (ii) individuals of size less than 100 cm of lower jaw fork length; (iii) individuals of size greater than 100 cm. The latter two partitions were considered with the intention to confirm whether maturation differentiates the animal’s behavior. The low number of blue shark catches, compared to swordfish, led us to a diverse modeling approach. Firstly, as a first step we modeled the probability of making a catch and secondly we modeled the positive catch rates separately, as in swordfish. It was deduced that spatio-temporal variables (Longitude, Latitude, Month, year) along with the <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> were the most influential on the catches. Environmental constituents (Lunar index, thermal fronts, sea surface temperature) were of less importance and had only some partial effect. Distance from coast was proven to be a very significant factor, bearing a dual property as a variable: spatial and environmental. In particular, immature and mature swordfish differentiated significantly: adult specimens were more abundant to the south-east (Levantine), at the open seas preferring cooler water masses. In contrast, juveniles were more frequently observed to the north-west (Ionian), close to warmer coastal waters. Seasonally, juvenile swordfish were more proliferate in catches during the start and end of the fishing period, and during years of high water temperatures. Increased concentrations of swordfish were detected in the vicinity of thermal fronts. The lunar disc illumination affected positively all year classes, with maximum catches observed around full moon. Although no obvious decline of swordfish abundance was noticed, average size of specimens caught did decrease considerably during the study period. An extended migratory pattern was not confirmed. However, there were strong indications suggesting that Ionian and Levantine actually represent spawning grounds. Blue sharks were encountered more frequently to the north-west of our study area, during late summer in open sea cool water masses. However, the probability of locally high concentrations was higher to the south-east, during springtime, in coastal warm waters. Their presence in catches showed a constant plummeting trend through the years. Annual spring movements towards the shore are most probably related to reproductive activity. Both species are considered to be under severe fishing pressure. Annual closure of swordfish fishery during the winter months, enforced the past 20 years, represent a set of beneficial measures. Introduction of a minimum landins size for blue sharks, appears to be absolutely essential, since the declining annual abundance trends presented in this study, come as a confirmation of other analogous research. ...|$|E

40|$|The Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 {{mandates}} that regional fishery management Councils designate essential fish habitat (EFH) {{for each of}} the species which are managed, assess the effects of fishing on EFH, and develop conservation measures for EFH where needed. This synthesis of effects of fishing on fish habitat was produced to aid the fishery management councils in assessing the impacts of fishing activities. A wide range of studies were reviewed that reported effects of fishing on habitat (i. e., structural habitat components, community structure, and ecosystemprocesses) for adiversity of habitats and <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>types.</b> Commonalities of all studies included immediate effects on species composition and diversity and a reduction in habitat complexity. Studies of acute effects were found to be a good predictor of chronic effects. Recovery after fishing was more variable, depending on habitat type, life history strategy of component species, and the natural disturbance regime. The ultimate goal of gear impact studies should not be to retrospectively analyze environmental impacts but ultimately to develop the ability to predict outcomes of particular management regimes. Synthesizing the results of these studies into predictive numerical models is not currently possible. However, conceptual models are presented which coalesce the patterns found over the range of observations. Conceptual models can be used to predict effects of gear impacts within the framework of current ecological theory. Initially, it is useful to consider fishes' use of habitats along a gradient of habitat complexity and environmental variability. A model is presented of gear impacts on a range of seafloor types and is based on changes in the structural habitat values. Disturbance theory provides Fis [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Sea turtles, {{marine mammals}} and sea birds are {{vulnerable}} to higher mortality rates as a direct function of incidental capture (bycatch) in marine fisheries. Their migratory behavior exposes them to multiple <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> and <b>fishing</b> practices and efforts to understand the rates of interaction between these taxa and fishing necessarily entails analysis of data over large spatial areas (ocean-basin) and multiple types of fishing activities. The acquisition the requisite data, however, requires considerable resources and many regions {{in the world are}} data-poor with respect to bycatch, including the Wider Caribbean Region (WCR) in the west central Atlantic Ocean basin. This dissertation presents the results of multiple strategies used to assess sea turtle, marine mammal and seabird bycatch in the WCR, with a particular focus on sea turtle bycatch. The research incorporated a synthetic review of the literature, expert consultation, statistical techniques, and geospatial analyses to assess the bycatch seascape for the region. I conclude that sea turtle bycatch in the WRC is significantly linked to turtle rookeries, especially those on the continental land mass and in the southern section of the Caribbean basin, {{in large part because of}} the near shore artisanal nature of the fisheries and the importance of these habitats for foraging and reproduction. The limited information on marine mammal bycatch does not permit robust inferences, but it clearly identifies threats to at least one vulnerable marine mammal species, the tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis). Information on seabird bycatch was even more limited; the most vulnerable seabird populations occur in the higher latitudes (temperate zones) while the seabird populations in the WCR face significant threats from habitat loss and over-exploitation. This dissertation proposes specific recommendations for improving and advancing the information base for a regional, ecosystem-level management and mitigation of bycatch. Dissertatio...|$|R

40|$|Fishery {{management}} on Lake Victoria in Uganda is {{constrained by}} lack of an effective fishery monitoring and regulatory mechanism, coupled with inadequate budgetary allocations to the fisheries sub-sector. This has led to high fishing pressure {{and a decline in}} the fishery. This paper presents a preliminary analysis of fisher-folk data collected over a period of one year at four landing sites in four districts along Lake Victoria in Uganda under a co-management pilot project aimed at addressing some of the problems in the <b>fishing</b> industry. <b>Gear</b> <b>type</b> and size and catch size of Nile perch in the different gear types/sizes was examined. Results indicated a declining fishery. Around 62. 7 % of the fishing canoes that target Nile perch on the lake were using <b>fishing</b> <b>gears</b> and methods that catch high proportions of immature Nile perch. Around 7. 1 % of the canoes caught Nile perch that was predominantly immature and illegal. Some 43. 4 % of the Nile perch in the overall sample was smaller than the size at first maturity for males and around 99. 7 % was below the size at first maturity for females. Expansion of the project in space and time, together with a revision of the current fishery regulatory law is recommended to improve the fishery management on Lake Victoria...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} aims at examining commercial fishermen’s subjective resilience to management changes in two Southern New England fishing ports. This study also aims at analyzing {{the relationship between}} job satisfaction and level of occupational attachment with fishermen’s perceived ability to adapt and cope to change. The two age groups examined were categorized into a younger and older generation by splitting the mean age value of 46. 6 to 45 for the older generation. Three hypotheses were developed: 1) Management practices have negatively influenced older fishermen’s perceptions {{on their ability to}} adapt to changes, where younger fishers perceive to be more resilient to management changes; 2) Level of resilience varies between <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>types.</b> For example, those fishers participating in net fisheries perceive to be less resilient and able to adapt to changes than those fishing dredge gear; and 3) Between port differences may influence the relationships between variables in the first two hypotheses. In order to test these hypotheses, a total of 92 interviews were conducted with fishermen from the ports of Point Judith, Rhode Island and New Bedford, Massachusetts. Results of analyses show that there is no difference between age groups on fishermen’s perceived level of resilience. However, results show a positive relationship between age and fishermen’s Perceptions of Risk. Those involved in dredge gear fisheries (scallop, ocean clam/quahog) were shown to be more confident in their ability to adapt and cope to management changes. Results suggest that income and monetary gains {{play an important role in}} fishermen’s perception of their ability to adapt and cope with changes. Correlations between levels of job satisfaction components suggest that a decrease in satisfaction with income and financial needs could result in lower levels of perceived ability to adapt and cope with management changes. Results from this study have the potential to contribute to the expansion of knowledge and inspire future research about the adaptability of fishermen for future policy strategies. ...|$|R
40|$|Marine litter is {{a global}} {{challenge}} that has recently received policymakers’ attention, with new environmental targets in addition to changes to old legislation. There are no global estimates of benthic litter because of the scarcity of data and only patchy survey coverage. However, estimates of baseline abundance and composition of litter are vital in order to implement litter reduction policies and adequate monitoring schemes. Two large-scale surveys of submarine geomorphological features in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans reveal that litter was found at all locations, despite their remoteness. Litter abundance was patchy, but both surveyed oceans had sites of high litter density. There {{was a significant difference}} in the type of litter found in the two oceans, with the Indian Ocean sites being dominated by <b>fishing</b> <b>gear,</b> whereas the Atlantic Ocean sites displayed a greater mix of general refuse. This study suggests that seabed litter is ubiquitous on raised benthic features, such as seamounts. It also concludes that the pattern of accumulation and composition of the litter is determined by a complex range of factors both environmental and anthropogenic. We suggest that the tracing of <b>fishing</b> effort and <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> would be an important step to elucidate hotspots of litter abundance on seamounts, ridges and banks...|$|R
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDIn this thesis, I examine {{household}} {{strategies in}} response to water level fluctuations of Lake Chilwa. I also analyse the frequency and patterns of migration of fishers, conflicts due to migration of fishers and comanagement. The following are the key results:First, the seasonal and periodic lake level changes affect livelihoods of the households. As a coping strategy, the households depend on fishing in pools of water located in influent rivers and hunt birds for income and food while others migrate to find work as casual labourers. When the lake rises during the rain season, inundated areas become suitable for production of maize and rice. However, when the floods recede in the dry season, farming of winter maize and vegetables is common. Second, migration of fishers is common around Lake Chilwa. The pattern of migration varies according to the season and <b>gear</b> <b>type.</b> The northern marshes and floodplain where fishers land the highest catches composed mainly of Barbus paludinosus, attract more fishers operating different <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>types.</b> Conflicts emerge due to the Nkacha seine operations,which require removal of aquatic vegetation. The local fishers believe that the aquatic vegetation {{is a source of}} food for fish. The conflicts are in various forms including access to fishing grounds, authority to grant access to fishing areas and fish price competition between the local fishers and migrants. Third, the household strategies towards recovery of the fishery after recessions are inherent within the households’ traditional system. However, the introduction of co-management does not recognise key actors that include fishers and river-based fishing households that participated in the formulation of conservation strategies for remnant fish stocks in lagoon and rivers during the 1995 recession. Co-management is characterised by limited participation of the fishers especially those operating seines, district assemblies and non-governmental organisations. Similarly, there is low transparency especially with respect to how the key stakeholders, Department of Fisheries and traditional leaders, take decisions. In stark contrast, accountability among Beach Village Sub- Committees is growing; hence more fishing households now perceive these as representing the interests of Department of Fisheries. Based on the above results, a diversified occupational change involving fishing, farming and trading is necessary. The co-management arrangement should be adaptive with consideration of the traditional customs and values of the participating households. Since these households are dependent on the availability of fisheries, it is thus imperative to promote maximum resource exploitation in between recessions and encourage a complete stop to fishing during recessions.

40|$|Situation: A {{permanent}} {{monitoring program}} for the shore-based Pacific whiting fleet needs to be developed and implemented, because of the specification in the Pacific Coast salmon and groundfish fishery management plans (FMPs) and the 1992 Biological Opinion analyzing {{the effects of the}} groundfish fishery on salmon stocks listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The issue of salmon retention in the groundfish trawl fisheries was brought before the Council in 1997 in the form of Amendment 10 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP and Amendment 12 to the Pacific Coast Salmon FMP. Based on an Environmental Assessment drafted to analyze these amendments, the Council recommended the exempted fishery permit (EFP) process be used temporarily until a permanent monitoring program could be developed and implemented in the shore-based Pacific whiting fishery. EFPs are intended to provide for limited testing of a <b>fishing</b> strategy, <b>gear</b> <b>type,</b> or monitoring program that may eventually be implemented on a larger fleet-wide scale and are not a permanent solution to the monitoring needs of the shore-based Pacific whiting fishery. Results of the shore-based Pacific whiting EFPs indicate that it is feasible to retain and appropriately monitor the incidental take of salmon and groundfish other than Pacific whiting in the shore-based Pacific whiting fishery. It is now appropriate to implement a permanent monitoring program for salmon an...|$|R

Entanglements {{have been reported}} off Korea, Japan, Canada, the United States, the Azores, Scotland, Portugal, France, Italy, Greece, Tunisia, Israel, the Canary Islands, Senegal, and Brazil. A total of 1,156 minke whales were caught off Korea between 1996 and 2008, {{an average of about}} 88 per year. They were mainly caught with set nets (31.4%), fish pots (27.3%), and gillnets (26.2%). Most were juveniles. Of 17 individuals that were reported caught in trap nets off eastern Honshu between 1978 and 1990, only two escaped alive, the rest being sold for their meat. Ship strikes are another source of mortality. They have been reported off the east coast of the United States, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and off Italy. A dwarf minke whale calf that stranded in New South Wales had one of its flukes cut by a propeller, which was the likely reason for its stranding and ensuing death.|$|R

Costs of derelict net survey and removal totaled $ 4, 960 per acre of net removed. Costs of survey and removal of derelict pots/traps totaled $ 193 per pot/trap. Directly measurable monetized benefits of derelict <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> removal were based on the commercial exvessel value of species saved from mortality over a one-year period for derelict pots/traps, totaling $ 248 per pot/trap and a ten-year period for derelict nets, totaling $ 6, 285 per acre. The costbenefit ratio was positive and similar for the removal of both <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> measuring 1 : 1. 28 for pots/traps and 1 : 1. 27 for derelict nets. Although indirect benefit values of human safety, impediments to vessel navigation, habitat restoration, reduction in mortality of non-commercial and protected or endangered species and pollution removal were not monetized, derelict <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> removal compared favorably in cost effectiveness with habitat restoration and oiled wildlife rehabilitation projects. Given the expected long-term lifespan of these mainly synthetic-based derelict gears, negative impacts may continue for many years or decades beyond the 10 -year period used in the cost-benefit analysis.

We would like to report on the results of our investigation of catch of two types of trawl net. Results obtained can be as follows; Catch of fish grouped into eleven classes by their swimming layer and form of body, then catches of two types of trawl net were compared. Catches of otter trawl net was significantly larger than that of sea slater net in fishes of sea bream, flat head, sea robin, goosefish and flat fish, but they were almost equal in fishes of cutlassfish, squid and shrimp. It estimated that the fact originated in the difference of the reaction to the <b>fishing</b> <b>gear</b> in each <b>types</b> of <b>fish.</b> <b>Gear</b> efficiency of sea slater net depended on the distance from sea bottom. It was over 20 cm of distance from sea bottom that sea slater net indicated its gear efficiency. 31 species of fish were caught in ordinary net which attached bobbin typed ground rope, while in sea slater net which attached chain typed ground rope, 31 species of fish were caught in a series of experiment. Catch per unit time of two types of net were 24. 17 kg/hour on ordinary net and 8. 74 kg/hour on sea slater net respectively. オッタートロール網を離底曳き網に改造してオッタートロール網との比較操業試験を行って次のような結果を得た。 1) 漁獲物をその生息場所と体型により分類し両網の漁獲量を比較するとタイ型,コチ・カナガシラ型,アンコウ型,カレイ・ヒラメ型ではオッタートロール網が有意に多い漁獲が あった。タチウオ型,イカ類,エビ類では両網とも略同じ漁獲が得られた。これは漁具に対する魚の反応行動の差に起因するものと考えられる。 2) 離底高さの低い場合には普通の底曳網と同じ漁獲性能を示し,離底曳き網としての漁獲性能を示すのは離底高さが約 20 cm以上の場合である...|$|R
