50|$|Depending on the application, {{backlash}} {{may or may}} not be desirable. It {{is unavoidable}} for nearly all reversing mechanical couplings, although its effects can be negated or compensated for. In many applications, the theoretical ideal would be zero backlash, but in actual practice some backlash must be allowed to prevent jamming. Reasons for the presence of backlash include allowing for lubrication, manufacturing errors, <b>deflection</b> <b>under</b> <b>load,</b> and thermal expansion.|$|E
50|$|Joists must {{exhibit the}} {{strength}} to support the anticipated load {{over a long period}} of time. In more developed countries such as the United States, the fabrication and installation of all framing members including joists must meet building code standards. Considering the cross section of a typical joist, the overall depth of the joist is critical in establishing a safe and stable floor or ceiling system. The wider the spacing between the joists, the deeper the joist will need to be to limit stress and <b>deflection</b> <b>under</b> <b>load.</b> Lateral support called dwang, blocking, or strutting increases its stability, preventing the joist from buckling under load. There are approved formulas for calculating the depth required and reducing the depth as needed; however, a rule of thumb for calculating the depth of a wooden floor joist for a residential property is to take half the span in feet, add two, and use the resulting number as the depth in inches; for example, the joist depth required for a 14‑foot span is 9 inches. Many steel joist manufacturers supply load tables in order to allow designers to select the proper joist sizes for their projects.|$|E

50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{completed}} in December 1889, and load testing of the completed bridge was carried out on 21 January 1890. Two trains, each consisting of three heavy locomotives and 50 wagons loaded with coal, totalling 1,880 tons in weight, were driven slowly from South Queensferry {{to the middle of}} the north cantilever, stopping frequently to measure the deflection of the bridge. This represented more than twice the design load of the bridge: the <b>deflection</b> <b>under</b> <b>load</b> was as expected. A few days previously there had been a violent storm, producing the highest wind pressure recorded to date at Inchgarvie, and the deflection of the cantilevers had been less than 25 mm (1 in). The first complete crossing took place on 24 February, when a train consisting of two carriages carrying the chairmen of the various railway companies involved made several crossings. The bridge was opened on 4 March 1890 by the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, who drove home the last rivet, which was gold plated and suitably inscribed. The key for the official opening was made by Edinburgh silversmith John Finlayson Bain, commemorated in a plaque on the bridge. When it opened it had the longest single cantilever bridge span in the world, until 1919 when the Quebec Bridge in Canada was completed. It continues to be the world's second-longest single cantilever span, with a span of 521 m.|$|E

In addition, thirteen bridges were cored. The influence of the level of load balancing, of the loading level and of the reinforcement on the effective stiffness of a bridge is discussed. A non-linear analysis of a partially post-tensioned bridge shows the influence of the modulus of elasticity of concrete, the tensile strength of concrete, the load balancing level and loading level on the concordance and the affinity between measured and calculated deflections.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The brown-rotted {{wood was}} {{liquefied}} in phenol with phosphoric acid as catalyst {{and the resulting}} liquefied products were condensed with formaldehyde to yield novolak liquefied wood-based phenol formaldehyde resin (LWPF). The results showed that brown-rotted wood could be more easily liquefied than sound wood in phenol. The residue content of liquefied wood decreased continually with the progress of brown-rot decay. Both water wash and neutralization and water wash slightly improved the thermofluidity and curing properties of LWPF with a small reduction of LWPF yield. An increase in phenol to wood (P/W) ratio from 2 to 3 slightly improved the flow property of LWPF, but with an accompanied by 20 % deduction in the product yield. Increased liquefaction time from 30 min to 60 min showed no significant influence on the resulting LWPF.

Consequently, attention should be paid to panels where the concrete cover of longitudinal reinforcement has spalled (grade 0) which could {{be a sign of}} decreasing load capacity.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of <b>deflection</b> <b>under</b> <b>load</b> {{is fundamental to}} the assessment of road pavement strength. Many authors have described the benefits of using GPR data to enhance assessment of deflection measurements made by devices such as the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD). However while GPR investigations can be undertaken quickly, FWD and other existing deflection methods are much slower which in turn limits productivity. This paper describes a 2010 field trial comparing data from two highway speed road measurement devices: the Danish made Traffic Speed Deflectometer (TSD) and the Australian made 3 -D noise modulated ground penetrating radar (NM-GPR) system used in the `Roadscout 2 ̆ 7 vehicle. Around 350 lane-kilometers of data from these devices were compared, showing a clear correlation. The methods {{were found to be}} particularly useful when used in combination - the TSD indicating where the pavement was weak, strong or variable and the GPR providing additional information to indicate why. In many cases changes in the data from both methods coincided, providing a direct indication of the cause of the change. In other instances either the TSD or GPR varied and the other method did not, indicating a different type of cause. It quickly became clear that the methods were complementary, providing two independent measurements of pavement response on which to assess current conditions. Overall the correlation between the NM-GPR and TSD data from this trial indicates great promise for using these methods in combination in the future. These methods provide key data needed to achieve rapid, large scale road pavement investigations, collected without public disruption at highway speeds...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) is {{made from}} {{dimensional}} lumber, laminated in layers with the grain in each layer placed orthogonal to the layer before it. The resultant product is not dissimilar to thick plywood. CLT {{is made from}} timber, which is an environmentally attractive option {{in comparison to the}} reinforced concrete or steel structures which dominate the multistorey building market sector. Timber is {{one of the very few}} sustainable carbon neutral building materials available. New technology such as advanced Building Information Modeling (BIM) software and high accuracy CNC machinery are giving CLT the advantage over traditional on-site construction methods. Prefabrication is the key to CLT’s improved construction time-frames, far greater quality control, than on-site construction can deliver. There are no CLT manufacturers currently producing in Australia. Hyne and Son Pty Ltd. is a leading Australian manufacturer and distributor of engineered, structural and decorative softwood products to the building industry. This project forms part of an initial investigation into cross laminated timber wall panels, manufactured from non-structural low grade pine. Initially, the investigations will be directed solely at the low-rise multistorey residential market sector, which Hyne already services with other products.

Its performance in most applications {{as measured by}} convergence of <b>deflections</b> <b>under</b> <b>loads</b> {{is limited by the}} simple bilinear functions used. Attempts have been made to enhance its performance by introducing what is called the residual bending flexibility (RBF) correction. ”’ Since these elements have a provision to include shear deformation, the RBF correction takes advantage of this fact by modifying the shear energy term to compensate for the deficient bending energy term so that superior performance is obtained. Recently it was shown that this is strictly an extra-variational trick (or ‘crime’), using as an example the two node beam element, which is the one-dimensional equivalent of the QUAD 4 element. It is not difficult to argue from this that the RBF correction, as it is frequently applied to QUAD 4 elements, will also disturb some properties of its performance, and especially its accuracy in stress prediction.
