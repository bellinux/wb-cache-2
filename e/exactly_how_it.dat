5|$|Deanesly and Grosjean's thesis was {{addressed}} and refuted by the textual research of Paul Meyvaert, following whose work most scholars {{have come to}} accept the Libellus as a genuine letter of Gregory. The only portion of the Libellus that Meyvaert could not accept as genuine was the chapter on marriage, which Meyvaert (like Boniface before him) believed {{could not have been}} written by Gregory. Meyvaert therefore pronounced this chapter to be the single interpolation in an otherwise genuine document. All subsequent scholarship up until the year 2008 has followed him on this point. In 2008 Ubl not only showed that the marriage chapter was in fact authored by Gregory, but he also explained <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was the Boniface and later historians came to misunderstand its meaning.|$|E
5|$|Many mental states {{seem to be}} {{experienced}} subjectively in different ways by different individuals. And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since {{no one has a}} perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.|$|E
5|$|Liubo: The {{now defunct}} board game liubo {{for the most}} part remains an enigma for modern {{scholars}} still deciphering <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was played; its association with both gambling and divination make it a unique game. The earliest two liubo game boards are found in the Zhongshan Tomb 3 at Shijiazhuang, Hebei. Similar finds, dating from the mid 4th century BC, are also found in the Chu Tomb 197 and 314 at Jiangling, Hubei. Liubo game boards have been found in several Western Han (202 BC– 9 AD) tombs; 1 wooden board at Jiangdu in Jiangsu; 1 wooden board in Tomb 8 at Fenghuangshan in Hubei; 1 lacquered set of liubo in Tomb 3 at Mawangdui Han tombs site in Hunan; 1 lacquered board in Tomb 1 at Dafentou in Yunnan; 1 bronze board at Xilin in Guangxi. During the Han Dynasty, an argument over the divination portents of the game {{as a result of a}} playing session led to a fight between a Western Han crown prince and Liu Xian (劉賢), where the latter was killed in the scuffle which (in part) prompted his father Liu Pi (劉濞), the King of Wu, to rebel against central Han authority in the Rebellion of the Seven States (154 BC). The British sinologist and historian Michael Loewe asserts that the set pieces of liubo were symbolic of the forces of the Chinese Five Elements, wu xing.|$|E

500|$|American Graffiti {{received}} widespread critical acclaim. Based on 43 reviews {{collected by}} Rotten Tomatoes, 95% {{of the critics}} enjoyed the film with an average score of 8.4/10. The consensus reads: [...] "One {{of the most influential}} of all teen films, American Graffiti is a funny, nostalgic, and bittersweet look at a group of recent high school grads' last days of innocence." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film a full four stars and praised it for being [...] "not only a great movie but a brilliant work of historical fiction; no sociological treatise could duplicate the movie's success in remembering <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was to be alive at that cultural instant".|$|E

'All You Need Is Love' by The Jamms is more than rife with a bit of The Beatles (with a dash of MC5 and Samantha Fox). It seems to be anti-AIDS, but as I know nothing about the band it could easily be a piss take. Either way this is a superb jam, if you can find it, buy it (it's so dodgily constructed in legal terms that no distributor info is given)." ...|$|E

Free association and silliness, I'm sure, played a big role." [...] Another Dylan chronicler, Oliver Trager, notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan's first name, the album title is also a riff on Brecht on Brecht, a stage production based on works by German playwright Bertolt Brecht that had influenced his early songwriting. Dylan himself has said of the title: [...] "Well, I don't even recall <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> came up, but I know it was all in good faith... I don't know who thought of that.

They speculate about anticipated large changes ahead with claims such as “The rise and fall of enterprises and entire national economies will hinge on making ‘intelligent factories’ a reality” (Wübbeke and Conrad, 2015), and “[Industry 4.0] is just beginning to take off and it’s difficult to imagine <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>it’s</b> all going to develop” (Gray and Hughes, 2016).

500|$|Gabriel Luna, who portrays Reyes, {{explained}} {{at the end}} of October 2016 {{that the}} confrontation between his character and the last member of the Fifth Street Locos gang in the episode [...] "Lockup" [...] revealed to Reyes that the accident that caused him to become Ghost Rider [...] "wasn’t just random, it was a hit, somebody ordered that, these guys were just the guys who carried it out—there’s a whole batch of new questions that Robbie has after that. In episode 6, we’re going to find out <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> happened, and we may find out why later." [...] Luna said that the series' take on Reyes' origin story would mix elements from Felipe Smith's original comic with [...] "this new angle that we’re approaching from, but that new angle still draws from the source material." [...] He also felt the episode's approach to revealing the story, by having Reyes tell it to his brother Gabe for the first time, was [...] "really interesting and powerful" [...] and the most surprising aspect of the script for him.|$|E

[...] Steve Persall wrote in the Tampa Bay Times he saw the movie in a crowded bar, yet [...] "until the shocking end, there's nothing less than rapt attention to this sordid thriller about an online predator (Wilson) and his not-so-innocent prey (Ellen Page). On a party night in New Orleans? That's how creepy-good this movie is." [...] Steve Schneider, writing in the Orlando Weekly, praised the films [...] "grabber of a sicko setup... It's a memorably tense pas de deux, and if the movie doesn't pay off on it properly, fault a script that ventures further and further into psychological thriller claptrap, leaving the two stars to rely on their hefty talents to keep it at all believable." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{his way to}} the hospital, Peter {{is confronted}} by a little girl, who says she holds the answer to his problem. He talks to the little girl, who runs off. While {{pursuing}} her, Peter encounters a group of men; a woman in red informs him these are alternate versions of himself, from alternate timelines where he never became Spider-Man. The woman in red transforms into the demon Mephisto, who tells Peter he can save Aunt May. As payment, Mephisto wants not Peter's soul, but his marriage to Mary Jane. Peter and Mary Jane are given until midnight the following night to decide their answer and, after several hours agonizing over the choice, they agree to the deal, as long as knowledge of Peter's secret identity is erased from the world. Mary Jane also whispers to Mephisto another, unspecified offer in return for Mephisto putting Peter's life back <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was and [...] " [...] him a chance at happiness." [...] Finally, Mephisto reveals to the couple that his disguise as the little girl was in fact their future daughter, but she will never exist because of their decision. [...] This future daughter is {{not to be confused with}} May [...] "Mayday" [...] Parker (Spider-Girl). [...] May [...] "Mayday" [...] Parker is the baby that Peter Parker and Mary Jane had at the end of the Clone Saga from the 1990s and would grow up to be Spider-Girl if Norman Osborn never killed her.|$|E
50|$|The Acafellas (Philip, Lassiter, Jasper, and JB) sing “Get Ready” to {{demonstrate}} to all the auditioning freshmen <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>it’s</b> done.

His nerves only get worse when he hears that Lassiter, the Acafellas’ pitch, is looking for a talented musician who knows how to blend, JB is hoping for a cool dude, and Philip wants a guy who won’t screw up their championship vibe. Simon knows he doesn’t exactly check those boxes. He gives a powerful but highly unorthodox audition with “Three Times A Lady”.|$|R

2500|$|There are {{concerns}} that the Pentagon and NSA will overshadow any civilian cyber defense efforts. There are also concerns on whether the command will assist in civilian cyber defense efforts. According to Deputy Secretary of Defense William J.

Responsibility for federal civilian networks – dot-gov – stays with the Department of Homeland Security, and that's <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> should be."

2500|$|Prescott {{explained}} Swope's {{methods in}} a 1997 interview: [...] "What Martin did ... was tape {{something that was}} going on live, manipulate it, and send it back in (via the soundboard) as a sort of new instrument. You couldn't predict <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> would sound, and that got to be the really fun thing I think we all liked. We wanted to play this hammer-down drony noise stuff, but we also wanted another sound in there." [...] Swope's tapework ranged from subtle and nearly subaural (such as the quiet shifting feedback sounds in Conley's [...] "That's When I Reach For My Revolver"), to prominent and even jarring (such as the high-pitched two-note squeal in Miller's [...] "Red"). Journalist Michael Azerrad later wrote: [...] "A lot of people never knew about Swope's contribution and were mystified by how the musicians onstage could wring such amazing phantom sounds from their instruments." [...] Though his contribution is widely considered an integral part of Burma's sound, Swope very rarely appeared onstage, only occasionally appearing to play second guitar during encores.|$|E

Invalid Channel said [...] "you can really tell that they've taken all of the footage themselves, it's not one-sided stock footage from the developing company. The hosts really play the games themselves and it shows, but you know that you're getting a real opinion from someone who played the game and know <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> handles and how annoying all those bugs are, not two people reading straight from some sort of rigid script." [...] He adds that [...] "being on a non-commercial network helps too" [...] as if the show was on a commercial network it may be more successful, but its credibility would be lost as [...] "once the game companies start paying sponsorship, you'd be seeing a lot of 10/10's {{and a whole lot of}} kiss-ass".|$|E
