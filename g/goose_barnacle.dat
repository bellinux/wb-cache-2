Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink-footed <b>goose,</b> <b>barnacle</b> goose and Taiga bean goose. The swans tend to fly off {{in the day and}} return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common pochard, northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{barnacles}} {{are considered}} edible by humans, including Japanese <b>goose</b> <b>barnacles</b> (e.g. Capitulum mitella), and <b>goose</b> <b>barnacles</b> (e.g. Pollicipes pollicipes), a delicacy in Spain and Portugal. The resemblance of this barnacle's fleshy stalk to a goose's neck gave rise {{in ancient times}} {{to the notion that}} geese, or at least certain seagoing species of wild geese, literally grew from the barnacle. Indeed, the word [...] "barnacle" [...] originally referred to a species of <b>goose,</b> the <b>barnacle</b> <b>goose</b> Branta leucopsis, whose eggs and young were rarely seen by humans because it breeds in the remote Arctic.|$|R

50|$|Among {{a sample}} of 100 minke whales caught in the western North Pacific in 1995, 78% had the copepod P. balaenopterae {{anchored}} into their skin and blubber - the <b>goose</b> <b>barnacle</b> C. virgatum was found attached to P. balaenopterae on three of the whales. The whale louse C. balaenopterae {{was found on the}} skin of four whales, while a single whale had the pseudo-stalked barnacle X. globicipitis attached to its skin. All individuals sampled were infected with the nematode Anisakis simplex in their stomachs (sometimes their small intestine) and the acanthocephalan Bolbosoma nipponicum in their small intestine. Other internal parasites included the cestodes Diphyllobothrium macroovatum, Diplogonoporus balaenopterae, and Tetrabothius sp., which infected the small intestine and were found in 17 per cent of the sample (all three species combined).|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} nesting birds on the skerries of MÃ¤laren {{are also the}} most common in the Baltic Sea. After a survey in 2005, the ten most common species {{were found to be}} common tern, herring gull, black-headed gull, common gull, mallard, tufted duck, Canada goose, common goldeneye, lesser black-backed gull and common sandpiper. White-tailed eagle, greylag <b>goose,</b> <b>barnacle</b> goose, black-throated diver, red-breasted merganser and gadwall are less common, and some of these latter are {{endangered}} in the MÃ¤laren area. Since 1994 a subspecies of great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis, has nested there as well. A 2005 survey tallied 23 breeding colonies with 2178 nests, of which the largest colony had 235 nests. Most experts believe the great cormorant population has peaked and will stabilize at around 2000 nests.|$|E
