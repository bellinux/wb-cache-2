50|$|<b>Dammar</b> <b>gum,</b> or damar gum, is {{obtained}} from the Dipterocarpaceae family of trees in India and East Asia, principally those of the genera Shorea, Balanocarpus or Hopea. Most is produced by tapping trees; however, some is collected in fossilised form from the ground. The gum varies in colour from clear to pale yellow, while the fossilised form is grey-brown. <b>Dammar</b> <b>gum</b> is a triterpenoid resin, containing {{a large number of}} triterpenes and their oxidation products. Many of them are low molecular weight compounds (dammarane, dammarenolic acid, oleanane, oleanonic acid, etc.), but dammar also contains a polymeric fraction, composed of polycadinene.|$|E
50|$|Dammar {{is used in}} foods, as a {{clouding}} or glazing agent, and in incense, varnish {{and other}} products. Dammar varnish, made from <b>dammar</b> <b>gum</b> mixed with turpentine, was introduced as a picture varnish in 1826; commonly used in oil painting, both during the painting process and after the painting is finished.|$|E
50|$|When {{the image}} is {{finished}} and has dried {{for up to a}} year, an artist often seals the work with a layer of varnish that is typically made from <b>dammar</b> <b>gum</b> crystals dissolved in turpentine. Such varnishes can be removed without disturbing the oil painting itself, to enable cleaning and conservation. Some contemporary artists decide not to varnish their work, preferring the surface unvarnished.|$|E
5000|$|Amber is fossil resin (also called resinite) from {{coniferous}} {{and other}} tree species. Copal, kauri <b>gum,</b> <b>dammar</b> and other resins {{may also be}} found as subfossil deposits. Subfossil copal can be distinguished from genuine fossil amber because it becomes tacky when a drop of a solvent such as acetone or chloroform is placed on it. [...] African copal and the kauri gum of New Zealand are also procured in a semi-fossil condition.|$|R
50|$|Resins {{that are}} used in {{varnishes}} include amber, kauri <b>gum,</b> <b>dammar,</b> copal, rosin (pine resin), sandarac, balsam, elemi, mastic, and others. Shellac is also a resin. In the 1900s in Canada, resins from local trees were used to finish pianos. As a result, these now antique pianos are considered difficult to refinish. However, shellac can be used over the existing resins provided sufficient time is allowed for thin coats to cure. Thus the original finish can be returned to its original lustre while preserving the color and age-related crackle.|$|R

50|$|Agathis dammara is a medium-large conifer up to 60 metres {{in height}} found in {{tropical}} rainforests, growing from sea level to very high mountainous regions where it becomes extremely stunted. It {{belongs to the}} southern hemisphere family Araucariaceae, widespread throughout the entire Mesozoic, emerging about 200 million years ago. An extinct genus, Protodammara (which appeared long ago, during the Mesozoic), derives its name from this tree. This tree {{is a source of}} <b>dammar</b> <b>gum,</b> also known as cat-eye resin.|$|E
50|$|Various {{species of}} kauri give diverse resins such as kauri copal, Manilla copal and <b>Dammar</b> <b>gum.</b> The timber is {{generally}} straight-grained and of fine quality with an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and rot resistance, making it ideal for yacht hull construction. The wood {{is commonly used}} {{in the manufacture of}} guitars and ukuleles due to its light weight and relatively low price of production. It is also used for some Go boards (goban). The uses of the New Zealand species (A. australis) included shipbuilding, house construction, wood panelling, furniture making, mine braces, and railway sleepers.|$|E
50|$|Hopanoids {{are natural}} pentacyclic {{compounds}} (containing five rings) {{based on the}} chemical structure of hopane. The first known triterpenoid of the class, hydroxyhopanone, was isolated by two chemists at The National Gallery, London working on the chemistry of <b>dammar</b> <b>gum,</b> a natural resin used as a varnish for paintings. The name hopane {{was derived from the}} genus Hopea (a source of the resin) itself named after John Hope, the botanist. Since this first finding, however, hopanoids {{have been found to be}} present in nature in vast amounts as components of bacteria and other primitive organisms. A range of hopanoids are found in petroleum reservoirs, where they are used as biological markers. Hopanoids are not detected in archaea.|$|E

40|$|Dammar Asphalt (Daspal) is {{expected}} {{to be used as a}} bio-asphalt renewable binder for road construction. It is made with a modification of the "Jabung", which is the <b>dammar</b> <b>gum</b> based material mixed with grounded red brick debris and low quality cooking oil at a certain ratio. <b>Dammar</b> <b>gum</b> is obtained from the Dipterocarpaceae family of trees in India and East Asia, most are produced by tapping trees. The gum varies in color from clear to pale yellow. <b>Dammar</b> <b>gum</b> is a triterpenoid resin, containing a large number of triterpenes and their oxidation products. Many of them are low molecular weight compounds. The objective of this research is to analyze the chemical properties of Daspal uses a Resonance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) method to compare with conventional asphalt. The investigation using spectral data showed that all types of Daspal have similar functional groups of Saturate, Aromatic, Resins, and Asphalten as the 60 / 70 penetration conventional bitumen, so that based on its chemical properties Daspal can be considered as bioaspal...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Gum Dammar is {{a natural}} {{resinous}} material of plant Shorea javanica, family–Dipterocarpaceae. In the present investigation <b>Dammar</b> <b>gum</b> (DG) and alcohol soluble fraction of <b>Dammar</b> <b>gum</b> (DA) are evaluated for their physicochemical, mechanical and film forming characteristics. Films were produced by casting/solvent evaporation method from plasticizer free and plasticizer containing solutions. Films prepared from different formulations were studied for their mechanical (tensile strength, percent elongation and Young’s modulus), water vapor transmission and moisture absorption characteristics. Unplasticized DG, DA films were brittle and posed the problem of breaking during handling. Hydrophobic plasticizers, dibutyl phthalate (DBP), improved the mechanical properties of free films with plasticizer showing significant effects on film elongation. Thus present study proposes DG and DA as excellent film formers. INTRODUCTION: Polymers are the younges...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the present}} work was to {{formulate}} and evaluate an oral pulsatile drug delivery system using natural superdisintegrants and natural polymers to achieve time release of Indomethacin, based on chronopharmaceutical approach {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis. Pulsatile delivery system is capable of delivering drug when and where it required most. By administering the system at bedtime, but releasing drug as a burst after the lag time (during peak morning hours) thereby delivering the drug when and where it is required the most with decreased side effects, dose size and prolonged action. The press-coated pulsatile release tablet contains Indomethacin in the inner rapid release core tablet formulated by direct compression method using plantago ovata mucilage and modified agar as superdisintegrants and the external coat formulated using natural polymers such as <b>dammar</b> <b>gum,</b> chitosan, xanthan gum and gaur gum by both direct and wet granulation method. The prepared press-coated pulsatile tablets were evaluated for various pre-compressional and post-compressional parameters. In-vitro release profiles of pulsatile device during 10 h studies were found to have very good sustaining efficacy. Formulation code A 1, A 8, B 2 and B 7 were selected as the best formulations with formulation B 2 containing xanthan gum and <b>dammar</b> <b>gum</b> in the ratio 2 : 1 having maximum lag time of 7 h 15 min...|$|E
