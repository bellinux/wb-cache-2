[...] Once {{production}} of the first movie was finished, the Coens began to recruit staff to film Barton Fink. Turturro looked forward to playing the lead role, and spent a month with the Coens in Los Angeles to coordinate views on the project: [...] "I felt <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> something more human to Barton. Joel and Ethan allowed me a certain contribution. I tried to go a little further than they expected." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Beckinsale {{landed the}} role of Hero in Kenneth Branagh's big-screen {{adaptation}} of Much Ado About Nothing. It was filmed in Tuscany, Italy, during a summer holiday from Oxford University. She attended the film's Cannes Film Festival premiere and remembered it as an overwhelming experience. [...] "Nobody even told me <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> a friend!" [...] "I had Doc Martens boots on, and I think I put the flower from the breakfast tray in my hair." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was won over by her [...] "lovely" [...] performance while Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted that she and Robert Sean Leonard [...] "look right and behave with a certain naive sincerity, although they often seem numb with surprise at hearing the complex locutions they speak." [...] The film earned over $22million at the box office. She made three other films while at university. In 1994, she appeared as Christian Bale's love interest in Prince of Jutland, a film based on the Danish legend which inspired Shakespeare's Hamlet, and starred in the murder mystery Uncovered. In 1995, while studying in Paris, she filmed the French language [...]|$|E
500|$|Born Esham Attica Smith on September 20, 1973 in Long Island, New York, Esham grew up {{splitting}} {{time between}} the Seven Mile neighborhood on the East side of Detroit, where {{he lived with his}} mother. He attended Osborn High School, and lived with his grandmother in New York during summers. He studied piano, guitar, and trombone in high school, and listened to artists such as Sugar Hill Gang, Run-DMC, Ozzy Osbourne and Kiss. Esham began to write original lyrics, and was encouraged by his older brother, James H. Smith, to seriously pursue a career in hip hop. According to Esham, [...] "He felt like I had a dope flow, and he thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> something new to the game, just coming from the city of Detroit. Back then, it wasn't really a [...] music scene in Detroit. Everybody was just imitating what everybody else was doing." [...] In the second grade, Esham met Champtown, who was also an aspiring rapper. The two performed together at open mic events Seafood Bay. In one occurrence, Champtown and Esham were forced to rap for a drug dealer at gunpoint.|$|E

500|$|Soap Opera Digest {{noted the}} rarity of {{brothers}} like Edmund Grey and Dimitri Marick. In {{the soap opera}} genre, brothers with a standing rivalry {{as well as a}} strong fraternal bond are considered to be a rarity. Sisters on soap operas were usually the ones who shared [...] "men, makeup, and misery." [...] Dimitri and Edmund's relationship was scripted as complicated, transitioning between loving and antagonistic. Their relationship gained positive feedback from both viewers and the soap opera media. Soap Opera Digest named them Best Brothers of 1994, saying, [...] "In Michael Nader (Dimitri) and John Callahan (Edmund), AMC has charismatic performers with chemistry, and they're making the most of it." [...] Complications in the brothers' relationship included childhood jealousies, the revelation that they were brothers, Dimitri's one-night stand with Edmund's wife Maria and subsequent question of the paternity of Maddie Grey, and the Dimitri, Alex, and Edmund triangle. Along with the conflict, they displayed a loving relationship where they stood by each other. In describing the relationship, Nader said, [...] "The storyline with Edmund and Dimitri, the Marick brothers, there wasn't a brother duo on television that had the sort of power that John and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> to that relationship." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rose Kennedy {{stated that}} she felt {{completely}} fulfilled as a full-time homemaker. In her 1974 autobiography, Times to Remember, she wrote, [...] "I looked on child rearing {{not only as a}} work of love and a duty, but as a profession that was fully as interesting and challenging as any honorable profession in the world and one that demanded the best <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> to it..... What greater aspiration and challenge are there for a mother than the hope of raising a great son or daughter?" ...|$|E

Marmon responded, to a [...] "Mrs. Harding", {{and a few days}} later she received a reply from Dyer. From Oxford Road in Reading, [...] "Mrs Harding" [...] wrote that [...] "I should be glad to have a dear little baby girl, one <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> up and call my own." [...] She continued: [...] "We are plain, homely people, in fairly good circumstances. I don't want a child for money's sake, but for company and home comfort... Myself and my husband are dearly fond of children. I have no child of my own. A child with me will have a good home and a mother's love".|$|E

Instead I hastily scrabbled up in tissue paper a large flat brooch--a bloodstone set in pinchbeck--a thing of no intrinsic value, alas, but precious to me because it had been the gift of an old servant of my mother's. I hastened out and lifting it over my head, pushed it into her hand.|$|R
2500|$|On 29 January 2014, {{following}} a 0–0 draw {{at home to}} West Ham United, Mourinho described the Hammers as playing [...] "19th century football", saying, [...] "This {{is not the best}} league in the world, this is football from the 19th century," [...] and, [...] "The only [...] thing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> was a Black and Decker to destroy the wall." [...] On 19 April 2014, Mourinho suffered his first ever home league defeat as Chelsea manager in a 2–1 loss to Sunderland at Stamford Bridge. He consistently played down Chelsea's title chances throughout the season and referred to it as a transitional season, slowly moulding his squad and most significantly dropping (and eventually selling) Chelsea's player of the year of the two previous seasons, Juan Mata. Chelsea went on to finish third in the 2013–14 Premier League, four points behind champions Manchester City.|$|E
2500|$|The {{writer of}} Earth 2, Tom Taylor, {{specifically}} resurrected Lois Lane on Earth 2 {{after he was}} told to kill off the character in the Injustice comic series. Taylor stated [...] "bringing Lois in was quite a personal thing, because having to do such horrible, horrible things to her in Injustice, the first thing I asked when I got on the book was if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> back Lois. Then {{it was just a matter}} of working out exactly how." [...] Taylor received [...] "Women in Refrigerators" [...] criticism for his Injustice comic stories. Bringing back Lois as Red Tornado was Taylor's way to [...] "unfridge" [...] Lois. As Taylor noted, in Lois' first appearance as Red Tornado, Lois literally came out of a blue refrigerator. Other reasons for bringing back Lois involve Superman, Taylor commented [...] "While evil bastard Superman is out there killing and maiming and destroying, I wanted Lois to exist as the counterpoint to this. She's the beating heart at the center. She's the good Ying to Superman's evil Yang. Where there's Lois, there's hope." ...|$|E
2500|$|Melkman, Mor-Salwo, Mangold, Zeller, & Benbenishty (2015) used a {{grounded}} theory approach to understand 1) the motivations and experiences which led young adult [...] "careleavers" [...] (N = 28, aged 18–26) in Israel and Germany {{to assume a}} helper role and 2) the benefits they report enjoying {{as a result of}} helping others through volunteerism and/or human-service focused careers. Participants reported that observing role models involved in helping roles, being exposed to prosocial values, and having opportunities to volunteer within the system in which they were simultaneously receiving care all contributed to later assumption of more stable and regular helping roles. These participants felt obliged to provide assistance to others, desired to provide this assistance to others, and felt sufficiently competent to carry out the tasks required of them in their helping role. These participants reported that helping others provided them with a sense of purpose in their lives, and also increased self-efficacy, social connectedness, and ability to cope with personal issues. Additionally, participants reported that assuming a helping role provided a sense of normalcy to their lives, as well as providing a sense of perspective on their own journey and outcomes. As one participant (a volunteer with a police department who was assigned to work with at-risk youth) shared with the researchers:"The fact that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> a runaway girl back to her home and I made her trust me, the fact that I located a missing girl, the fact that I escorted a rape victim to hospital and I managed to give her strength and support her, {{these are the things that}} give me meaning, tell me that I'm in a much better situation than others" [...] (p. 45).|$|E
