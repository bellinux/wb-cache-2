25|$|Advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1968 New Year Honours, Le Fanu became First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff in August 1968. In {{the face}} of {{economic}} difficulties he worked hard to reshape the Navy as an anti-submarine force operating primarily in the Atlantic Ocean. He was nominated for the post of Chief of the Defence Staff but never held the office because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> discovered to be terminally ill. He was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 3 July 1970, on his retirement, and died in London on 28 November 1970.|$|E

Both sides {{immediately}} rushed forth to rescue their respective generals and withdrew their forces after that. Later, Ling Tong was surprised to hear from Sun Quan that it was Gan Ning who saved him, and he knelt down and thanked the latter. Since then, Ling Tong forgot his past feud with Gan Ning and they became close friends.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{situation}} with Muhammad had been resolved, 'Ali took no action for a while. Eventually he decided to attack the stronghold of Mattuth and marched against it. When he arrived, however, he saw that it had strong fortifications and numerous defenders, {{so he decided to}} make further preparations before assaulting it. He withdrew and began assembling ladders and tools for scaling walls; once this was completed, he ordered his army to again approach the city. As he drew near Mattuth this time, however, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> attacked by Masrur al-Balkhi, who had learned of 'Ali's plans. The sight of Masrur's cavalry caused 'Ali's men to abandon their equipment and flee, and 'Ali was forced to retreat.|$|E

His second son Po Than Gyaung had gone underground in 1976 to join the Communists like his brother before him. U Hla's death at the age of 72, in August 1982, was unexpected by most who knew him as someone who had always lived a healthy life, although he developed diabetes later in life. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> taken ill just {{as he was about to}} be interviewed by a Japanese woman researcher accompanied by the writer Maung Tha-ya, rushed to hospital, and he died the same evening.|$|E

25|$|Bill Fulton, {{the owner}} of the {{unlicensed}} security firm said the journalist, Tony Hopfinger, was trespassing at a private event and had assaulted a Miller supporter by shoving him. Fulton was subsequently named as the federal informant who supplied weapons to a radical accused of plotting the deaths of officials in Fairbanks. The Anchorage Daily News described the event as public, and a school district spokesperson noted that the hallway where the arrest took place was a public area. Hopfinger said he had been trying to ask Miller whether he had been disciplined while working as a local government lawyer, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> surrounded by guards and supporters, and bumped or shoved against one of them. No charges were filed against anyone in relation to the incident.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman {{government}} {{during the}} early years of the reign of Sultan Mehmed IV (r. 1648–1687) was rife with factional disputes and power struggles. Thus in 1651, after three years of faithfully carrying out service overseeing the Yeni Il Türkmen, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> removed from office at the insistence of a palace faction of Ocak Aghas (cavalry commanders) led by Bektaş Agha. Despite the intercession of the Şeyhülislâm Karaçelebizade Abdulaziz Efendi, he was unable to regain his office. The grand vizier Melek Ahmed Pasha recognized the injustice which Abaza Hasan had suffered, but was too reliant on the support of the Aghas to be willing to help. A contemporary source depicts him fuming with rage and swearing revenge upon the Ocak Aghas. Giving up on the legal means of recompense, he and his supporters left Istanbul and began gathering an army in Anatolia, demanding either the return of his office or 60,000 guruş (silver coins of foreign origin) in compensation.|$|E

500|$|Still {{feeling the}} chest injury {{sustained}} during the 1818 election, Maxwell returned to Britain in 1826 and entered retirement; {{during this period}} he also reportedly had a bout of depression, especially following {{the sudden death of}} his youngest daughter in 1827. In 1830, he was recalled by the newly crowned King William IV. [...] A former naval officer himself, King William selected a number of senior Navy officers to be his aides de camp, including Maxwell, who was subsequently appointed to succeed John Ready as Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island on 14 March 1831. As Maxwell sailed from his home in Scotland to London to make preparations for his departure, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> taken ill. Medical assistance was unavailable for 48 hours during the passage, and the weather too rough for him to go ashore in an open boat in his condition. As a result, Maxwell died shortly after arriving at Green's Hotel in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London; Colonel Aretas William Young took his place as governor. Maxwell was buried at St Marylebone Parish Church, and was survived by his wife and their son John Balfour Maxwell, who died in 1874 as an admiral of the Royal Navy.|$|E
500|$|Aubrey {{replaced}} CBS Television president Louis Cowan, who {{was slowly}} dismissed after the quiz show scandals. Despite his successes in television, Aubrey's abrasive personality and oversized ego– [...] "Picture Machiavelli and Karl Rove at a University of Colorado football recruiting party" [...] wrote Variety in 2004– {{led to his}} firing from CBS amid charges of improprieties. [...] "The circumstances rivaled the best of CBS adventure or mystery shows," [...] declared The New York Times in its front-page story on his firing, which came on [...] "the sunniest Sunday in February" [...] 1965. He earned the nickname [...] "Smiling Cobra" [...] for his brutal decision-making ways. Aubrey governed CBS with a firm grip, {{and it did not}} go unnoticed. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> dismissed in February 1965. Aubrey offered no explanation following his dismissal, nor did CBS President Frank Stanton or Board Chairman William Paley. After four years as an independent producer, Aubrey was hired by financier Kirk Kerkorian in 1969 to preside over Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's near-total shutdown, during which he slashed the budget and alienated producers and directors but brought profits to a company that had suffered huge losses. In 1973, Aubrey resigned from MGM, declaring his job was done, and then vanished into almost total obscurity for the last two decades of his life.|$|E
500|$|As the {{acoustic}} tour made Grohl realize [...] "we were making music worth listening to, rather than music made for pummelling the person next to you" [...] {{he decided to}} give more importance to the lyrics and [...] "have a connection with the crowd in front of us", considering that among the many compositions the band made on pre-production [...] "the ones that stand out {{are the ones that}} say something". So {{for the first time the}} lyrics started being written before recording begun, with Grohl stating that he [...] "sat in the back of the studio and just wrote every day for about 14 hours a day." [...] Most of the lyrics of the album deal with themes of birth, death and life, which Grohl attributed to the birth of his daughter Violet, considering that having a child [...] "changes your entire outlook on the world", and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> more emotional - [...] "So when you're writing music with that in mind or that in your heart, everything just blooms into this fucking incredibly colourful, colourful feeling." [...] Helped by the extensive lyrical preparation, the lyrics also tried to show more of Grohl's feelings, [...] "those things that you've always wanted to do or always wanted to say", with Hawkins adding that he could not listen to [...] "Stranger Things Have Happened" [...] as [...] "I'm one of his best friends, and the last thing I want to do is read a love letter to his wife or whoever it is." ...|$|E

500|$|Very {{was known}} as an eccentric, prone to odd {{behavior}} and may have suffered from bipolar disorder. The first signs of a breakdown came shortly after meeting Emerson, as Very was completing an essay on William Shakespeare. As Very later explained, [...] "I felt within me a new will... {{it was not a}} feeling of my own but a sensible will that was not my own... These two consciousnesses, as I may call them, continued with me". In August 1837, while traveling by train, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> overcome with terror at its speed until he realized he was being [...] "borne along by a divine engine and undertaking his life-journey". As he told Henry Ware Jr., professor of pulpit eloquence and pastoral care at Harvard Divinity School, divine inspiration helped him suddenly understand the twenty-fourth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew and that Christ was having his Second Coming within him. When Ware did not believe him, Very said, [...] "I had thought you did the will of the Father, and that I should receive some sympathy from you—But I now find that you are doing your own will, and not the will of your father". Very also claimed that he was {{under the influence of the}} Holy Spirit and composed verse while in this state. Emerson did not believe Very's claim and, noting the poor writing, he asked, [...] "cannot the spirit parse & spell?" [...] Very said he was also tormented by strong sexual desires which he believed were only held in check by the will of God. To help control himself, he avoided speaking with or even looking at women—he called it his [...] "sacrifice of Beauty".|$|E
500|$|All known Achelousaurus {{specimens}} {{were recovered}} from the Two Medicine Formation in Glacier County, Montana during excavations conducted by the Museum of the Rockies, which still houses the specimens. The discoveries came about by an accidental chain of events. In the spring of 1985, paleontologist John [...] "Jack" [...] R. Horner was informed that {{he would no longer}} be allowed to exploit the Willow Creek site, where he had studied the Maiasaura Egg Mountain nesting colony for six years. Having already made extensive arrangements for a new field season, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> forced to seek an alternative site. Horner had always been intrigued by the field diaries of Charles Whitney Gilmore who had reported the discovery of dinosaur eggs at Landslide Butte in 1928, but never published on them. In this locality, Gilmore had employed George Fryer Sternberg to excavate skeletons of the horned dinosaurs Brachyceratops and Styracosaurus ovatus. That summer, Horner obtained the permission of the Blackfeet Indian Tribal Council to prospect for fossils on Landslide Butte, {{which is part of the}} Blackfeet Indian Reservation; it was the first paleontological investigation at that location since the 1920s. In August 1985, Horner's associate Bob Makela discovered a rich fossil site on the land of the farmer Ricky Reagan, which was called the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry and contained fossils of horned dinosaurs. On 20 June 1986, Horner and Makela returned to the Blackfeet Indian Reservation and resumed work on the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry, which proved to contain, apart from eggs, more than a dozen skeletons of a horned dinosaur later named Einiosaurus. In August 1986, at a nearby site – the Canyon Bone Bed on the land of Gloria Sundquist, east of the Milk River – Horner's team discovered another Einiosaurus bone bed. Part of the discoveries made on this occasion was an additional horned dinosaur skull, specimen MOR 492, that later would be referred to (i.e., formally assigned to) Rubeosaurus, the genus name in 2010 given to Styracosaurus ovatus.|$|E
