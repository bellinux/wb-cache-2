40|$|Sweden has a {{long history}} of {{research}} within the field of rock fissure grouting in hard crystalline rock mass due to strict environmental requirements regarding allowable ground water draw down. These requirements normally implies that fractures down to aperture size between 50 to 100 μm needs to be sealed and within these ranges the size of the particles for cementitious grouting agents becomes a limiting factor. For a grouting design it is therefore of importance to consider the aperture size distribution of the rock mass in order to predict the groutability for both cementitious and non-cementitious grouting agents. Transmissivity data from <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tests</b> (water <b>pressure</b> <b>tests)</b> and number of fractures along a borehole can be assessed from core logging for further use as input for a statistical interpretation of fracture data to simulate an aperture size distribution. A methodology developed at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, is proposed. The method is a statistical evaluation of groutability (SEG) and is based on the Pareto distribution. A computational design tool has been developed to simplify the use of the statistical evaluation and to make the research more accessible to end users, designers, in the grouting industry. The aim of this article is to present two case studies where the statistical interpretation of fracture data is performed by using the computational design tool and how the outcome can be of great use in finding a more accurate grouting design.

In turn, looking at saturated active clays only, the state parameters seem to be controlled by the effective stress history (SH), ionic valence (vi) and related exposure sequence of salt concentrations in the pore solution (cs). A theoretical framework, able to describe chemical, hydraulic and mechanical behaviors of bentonites in the case of one-dimensional strain and flow fields, has been set up. In particular, the relationships, linking the aforementioned state and intrinsic parameters of a given bentonite with its hydraulic conductivity (k), effective diffusion coefficient (D*s), osmotic coefficient (w) and swelling pressure (usw) under different stress-histories and solute concentration sequences, are presented.

40|$|Grouting or filling of {{the open}} voids in {{fractured}} rock is done by introducing a fluid, a grout, through boreholes under pressure. The grout may be either a Newtonian fluid or a Bingham fluid. The penetration of the grout and the resulting pressure profile may give rise to hydromechanical effects, which depends on {{factors such as the}} fracture aperture, pressure at the borehole and the rheological properties of the grout. In this paper, we postulate that a new parameter, {angstrom}, which is the integral of the fluid pressure change in the fracture plane, is an appropriate measure to describe the change in fracture aperture volume due to a change in effective stress. In many cases, analytic expressions are available to calculate pressure profiles for relevant input data and the {angstrom} parameter. The approach is verified against a fully coupled hydromechanical simulator for the case of a Newtonian fluid. Results of the verification exercise show that the new approach is reasonable and that the {angstrom}-parameter is a good measure for the fracture volume change: i. e., the larger the {angstrom}-parameter, the larger the fracture volume change, in an almost linear fashion. To demonstrate the application of the approach, short duration <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tests</b> and constant <b>pressure</b> grouting are studied. Concluded is that using analytic expressions for penetration lengths and pressure profiles to calculate the {angstrom} parameter provides a possibility to describe a complex situation and compare, discuss and weigh the impact of hydromechanical couplings for different alternatives.

In that context, the Spanish Geological Survey (IGME, Spanish acronym), supported by the National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (ENRESA, Spanish acronym) and with the technical advice of the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB) designed and built a Mobile Hydrogeological Unit (UMH, Spanish acronym) for low-permeability formations characterization, which has been operational since 1997 and has been used for different purposes. Among other possibilities, the UMH allows conducting: constant transient-state flow-rate injection tests, constant-head transient-state injection tests, pseudo-stationary state injection <b>tests,</b> <b>pressure</b> fall-off <b>tests,</b> slug tests and pulse tests.

The mechanical criterion of the rematch is when the mean irreversible displacement after a cycle tends to zero.

Once the fracture has been rematched, and to ensure this state throughout the test, a minimum normal stress, termed pre-load stress, is applied continuously to the sample. In order to avoid/limit any mechanical damage of the asperities in contact during the rematching, the maximum value of normal stress applied will be determined by considering the in situ normal stress submitted by the fracture.|$|R
