Peritoneal macrophages and splenic lymphocytes were cultured either on the silicone-coated plates or on the conventional, normal plates, and their functions were compared with each other. The experiments were repeated three times. The cytotoxic activities of peritoneal macrophages on cancer cells were markedly augmented by cultivation on silicone gel, and the primary T-dependent immunoglobulin M response in which macrophages participated as antigen presenting cells was also enhanced by incubation on silicone gel.

However, relatively few studies have probed <b>immunotoxicities</b> of methylene chloride. In order to examine possible <b>immunotoxicities</b> or immunomodulating effects of methylene chloride, several tests of cellular immune function were performed using both human in In Vitro studies and a mouse model. Body weights and specific organ weights of thymus, spleen, liver, and kidney were normal in CD- 1 mice given various concentrations of methylenechloride. However, a significantly reduced mitogenic response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA} and reduced interleukin- 2 (IL- 2 } production was found in these methylene-chloride-treated mice. The findings in the mouse model provide additional evidence that immune suppression may be associated with exposure to methylene chloride. Splenic mononuclear cells isolated from CD- 1 mice were incubated with various concentrations of methylene chloride in vitro and investigated for blastogenic response to mitogen PHA and IL- 2 production. The results show no significant difference between methylene-chloride-treated cells and the cells treated with growth media. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from healthy donors were incubated with various concentrations of methylene chloride and tested for blastogenic activity, natural killer (NK) cell activity, and IL- 2 production.

40|$|Enzyme {{replacement}} therapy (ERT) with recombinant human acid-ฮฑ-glucosidase (rhGAA) {{is the only}} FDA approved therapy for Pompe disease. Without ERT, severely affected individuals (early onset) succumb to the disease within 2 years of life. A spectrum of disease severity and progression exists depending upon the type of mutation in the GAA gene (GAA), which in turn determines the amount of defective protein produced and its enzymatic activity. A large percent of the early onset patients are also cross reactive immunological material negative (CRIM-) and develop high titer immune responses to ERT with rhGAA. New insights from our studies in pre-clinical murine models reveal {{that the type of}} Gaa mutation has a profound effect on the immune responses mounted against ERT and the associated toxicities, including activation of clotting factors and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Additionally, the mouse strain affects outcomes, suggesting the influence of additional genetic components or modifiers. High doses of rhGAA (20 mg/kg) are currently required to achieve therapeutic benefit. Our studies indicate that lower enzyme doses reduce the antibody responses to rhGAA, reduce the incidence of immune toxicity and avoid ERT-associated anaphylaxis. Therefore, development of rhGAA with increased efficacy is warranted to limit <b>immunotoxicities...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{biological}} and chemical agents {{have the capacity to}} alter the way the immune system functions in human and animals. This study evaluates the <b>immunotoxicity</b> of 20 substances used widely in work environments. METHODS: A systematic literature search on the <b>immunotoxicity</b> of 20 chemicals was performed. The first step was to review literature on <b>immunotoxicity</b> testing and testing schemes adopted for establishing <b>immunotoxicity</b> in humans. The second step consisted of providing a documentation on <b>immunotoxicity</b> of substances that are widely used in work environment, by building tables for each chemical of interest (benzene, trichloroethylene, PAHs, crystalline silica, diesel exhausts, welding fumes, asbestos, styrene, formaldehyde, toluene, vinyl chloride monomer, tetrachloroethylene, chlorophenols, 1, 3 -butadiene, mineral oils, P-dichlorobenzene, dichloromethane, xylene, 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane, ethylene oxide). The third step was the classification of substances; an index (strong, intermediate, weak, nil) was assigned {{on the basis of the}} evidence of toxicity and type of immunotoxic effects (immunosuppression, autoimmunity, hypersensitivity) on the basis of the immune responses. Finally substances were assigned a score of immunotoxic power. RESULTS: Tables have been produced that include information for the 20 substances of interest, based on 227 animal studies and 94 human studies. Each substance was assigned an index of immunotoxic evidence, a score of immunotoxic power and type of immunotoxic effect.

Four study designs were used, with either premating or post-weaning onset of exposure, continued to postnatal day 50, and with or without additional oral gavage of pups from postnatal day 10 onward. Reduced litter size (benchmark dose lower confidence limit (BMDL) 80 mg/kg bw/day) was the most sensitive developmental parameter, with pup relative organ weight effects observed at similar BMDLs, {{in the absence of}} maternal toxicity. Eosinophil numbers were reduced at lower doses (BMDL 16 mg/kg bw/day). KLH challenge resulted in increased IL- 13 and TNF-alpha responses, and variably reduced IgG production (BMDL 27 mg/kg bw/day). T- 4 levels were reduced by 11 % at maximum with a BMDL of 73 mg/kg bw/day. Differences between exposure cohorts were limited and were considered to be without biological significance. This study shows that 4 MA induces developmental <b>immunotoxicity</b> at doses below those inducing developmental and general toxicity. These observations being independent of the study designs applied suggest that the post-weaning period, included in all designs, is the most relevant sensitive period for inducing 4 MA mediated developmental <b>immunotoxicity.</b> Moreover, this study stresses the importance of including developmental <b>immunotoxicity</b> testing by default in regulatory toxicology.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} two {{separate and distinct}} research projects with a common overall theme - the study of <b>immunotoxicity</b> associated with the developmental exposure of young birds to halogenated chemicals posing environmental concern. These chemicals share many chemical characteristics, including environmental ubiquity and longevity, one has been studied extensively since the 1970 s, and one {{is a relatively new}} environmental contaminant with few studies pertaining to toxicological affects on humans or wildlife. Specific summaries of each study begin each project chapter. The first study was entitled Developmental and Immunological Effects of a Commercial Mixture of PBDE Flame Retardants in Chicken Embryos. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine if chicken embryos exposed in ovo to a commercial mixture of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a halogenated flame retardant sharing many characteristics with PCBs and dioxins, presented indication of toxicity by way of increased mortality, developmental abnormalities, or <b>immunotoxicity.</b> Chicken (Gallus gallus) embryos were exposed to a commercial PBDE mixture in ovo via air cell injection at environmentally relevant concentrations. This study resulted in minimal impacts by PBDEs with respect to mortality and <b>immunotoxicity</b> at the doses tested, but interesting, however non-significant results with respect to deformities. The second study, entitled Immunotoxic Effects of 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in the Wood Duck (Aix sponsa) : A Sensitive Indicator Species?, was conducted in cooperation with the US Fish and Wildlife Service in Raleigh, NC. The objective of this research was to determine if wood ducks exposed in ovo to environmentally relevant concentrations of TCDD expressed signs of <b>immunotoxicity.</b> Previous research has shown that wood ducks may be extremely sensitive to low dioxin levels. Accounting for high sensitivity to dioxin-like chemicals and certain life history and behavioral patterns associated with wood ducks, results of previous research has suggested that wood ducks may be an ideal indicator species for environmental contamination and remediation.

ATR at doses of 0, 100, 200, or 400 [*]mg/kg body weight was administered to Balb/c mice daily for 21 days by oral gavage. The studies performed 24 [*]hr after the final exposure showed that ATR could induce the generation of reactive oxygen species in the spleen of the mice, increase the level of advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) in the host serum, and cause the depletion of reduced glutathione in the serum, each in a dose-related manner. In addition, DNA damage was observed in isolated splenocytes as evidenced by increase in DNA comet tail formation. ATR exposure also caused increases in intracellular Ca 2 + within splenocytes. Moreover, ATR treatment led to increased expression of genes for some antioxidant enzymes, such as HO- 1 and Gpx 1, as well as increased expression of NF-ฮบB and Ref- 1 proteins in the spleen.

40|$|Perfluorooctane {{sulfonate}} (PFOS) is {{a persistent}} organic pollutant that is used worldwide and is continuously being detected in biota and the environment, thus presenting potential threats to the ecosystem and human health. Although PFOS is highly immunotoxic, its underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. The present study examined PFOS-induced <b>immunotoxicity</b> in the mouse spleen and explored its underlying mechanisms by gene expression profiling. Oral exposure of male BALB/c mice for three weeks followed by one-week recovery showed that a 10 mg/kg/day PFOS exposure damaged the splenic architecture, inhibited T-cell proliferation in response to mitogen, and increased the percentages of T helper (CD 3 (+) CD 4 (+)) and cytotoxic T (CD 3 (+) CD 8 (+)) cells, despite the decrease in the absolute number of these cells. A delayed type of PFOS <b>immunotoxicity</b> was observed, which mainly occurred during the recovery period. Global gene expression profiling of mouse spleens and QRT-PCR analyses suggest that PFOS inhibited the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and NRF 2 -mediated oxidative stress response, and upregulated those in TCR signaling, calcium signaling, and p 38 /MAPK signaling pathways. Western blot analysis confirmed that the expressions of CAMK 4, THEMIS, and CD 3 G, which {{were involved in the}} upregulated pathways, were induced upon PFOS exposure. Acute PFOS exposure modulated calcium homoeostasis in splenocytes. These results indicate that PFOS exposure can activate TCR signaling and calcium ion influx, which provides a clue for the potential mechanism of PFOS <b>immunotoxicity.</b> The altered signaling pathways by PFOS treatment as revealed in the present study might facilitate in better understanding PFOS <b>immunotoxicity</b> and explain the association between immune disease and PFOS exposure.

The metal binding property of amla could reduce the load of arsenic in spleen and thymus and help to decrease the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species associated with the oxidative stress and imparts its protective effects. Amla may modulate inflammatory responses by decreasing the production of several chemokines, preventing infiltration of immune cells to the damaged area, and promoting the generation of immunoprotective cytokines to accelerate the repair process. As the mechanism of prevention is not clearly understood, further studies are required to investigate the detailed mechanism of immunoprotection of amla in arsenic induced <b>immunotoxicity.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of extended histopathology to detect immunotoxic chemicals in female B 6 C 3 F 1 micewas evaluated {{under the auspices}} of the National Toxicology Program (NTP). A workgroup was formed consisting of four pathologists who conducted extended histopathological evaluation of lymphoid tissues obtained from a subset of NTP toxicology studies, in which previously detailed <b>immunotoxicity</b> assessment was performed. In addition, a positive control data set of three known immunosuppressive agents, one negative control data set, and an additional negative control group composed of the vehicle only treated groups were included. Data obtained fromextended histopathology evaluationswere com-pared to more traditional immune test results (both functional and nonfunctional) from previously conducted <b>immunotoxicity</b> assess-ments. Analyses of the data indicated that the ability to identify immunotoxic chemicals using histological endpoints decreased lin...|$|E
