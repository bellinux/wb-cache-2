40|$|Eukaryotic cells {{contain a}} {{delicate}} balance of minute amounts of the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), sufficient {{only for a few}} minutes of DNA replication. Both a deficiency and a surplus of a single dNTP may result in increased mutation rates, faulty DNA repair or mitochondrial DNA depletion. dNTPs are usually quantified by an enzymatic assay in which incorporation of radioactive dATP (or radioactive dTTP in the assay for dATP) into specific synthetic oligonucleotides by a DNA polymerase is proportional to the concentration of the unknown dNTP. We find that the commonly used Klenow DNA polymerase may substitute the corresponding ribonucleotide for the unknown dNTP leading in some instances to a large overestimation of dNTPs. We now describe assay conditions for each dNTP that avoid ribonucleotide incorporation. For the dTTP and dATP assays it suffices to minimize the concentrations of the <b>Klenow</b> <b>enzyme</b> and of labeled dATP (or dTTP); for dCTP and dGTP we had to replace the <b>Klenow</b> <b>enzyme</b> with either the Taq DNA polymerase or Thermo Sequenase.

Cyclic voltammetry indicates that the ferrocenyl moieties display reversible redox behaviour in aqueous buffer with E 1 / 2 values of 398 (Fc 1 -dUTP) and 260 mV (Fc 2 -dUTP) versus Ag/AgCl. Primer extension by the proofreading <b>enzymes</b> <b>Klenow</b> fragment and T 4 DNA polymerase shows that Fc 1 -dUTP is efficiently incorporated into DNA during synthesis, including incorporation of two successive modified nucleotides. Production of a 998 bp amplicon by Tth DNA polymerase demonstrates that Fc 1 -dUTP is also a satisfactory substrate for PCR. Despite its structural similarity, Fc 2 -dUTP acts predominantly as a terminator with the polymerases employed here. UV melting analysis of a 37 mer duplex containing five Fc 1 -dU residues reveals that the labelled nucleotide introduces only a modest helix destabilisation, with Tm = 71 versus 75 °C for the corresponding natural construct.

40|$|Radiotherapy is the {{clinical}} {{application of the}} ionizing radiation to treat cancer. Ionizing radiation causes multiple modes of damage to the DNA damage such as SSBs, DSBs and modified bases such as thymine glycol. These lesions can exist as clusters {{in one or two}} helical turns of DNA. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are extremely toxic to cells because they can lead to genomic rearrangements and even cell death. If base lesions accompany these DSBs, there will be a substantial hindrance for repair. NHEJ is the primary DSB repair pathway in mammalian cells. HRR repairs single strand breaks (SSBs) or Double strand breaks (DSBs), during late S phase and G 2 phase of the cell cycle, by using an undamaged copy of the DNA sequence, and is therefore largely error-free. The NHEJ pathway repairs DSBs without the requirement for sequence homology and can be error-free or error-prone, and is most active during G 1 phase. Thymine glycol (Tg) is the most common oxidation product of thymine. It is produced endogenously as a consequence of aerobic metabolism or via exogenous factors such as ionizing radiation (IR); {{it is one of the}} predominant types of base modifications produced by ionizing radiation. Due to clustering of radiation-induced damages, many DSBs are accompanied by damaged bases such as Tg at or near the DSB ends that may interfere with subsequent gap filling and ligation. The base excision repair pathway plays a major role in removal of thymine glycol from the damaged DNA strand. During NHEJ, after synapsis by Ku and DNAPKcs and processing of the DNA ends, XRCC 4 /Ligase IV complex ligates the DNA. This ligase activity is promoted by the interaction of XLF/XRCC 4 filament with Ligase IV. Linearized plasmids with Tg at the 5 th -Tg 5 positions from the broken end were subjected to a repair assay using XRCC 4 -like factor (XLF) -deficient cell extracts, with or without the addition of XLF and Endonuclease III and/or ddTTP and Klenow fragments. End joining of Tg 5 was compared to plasmid with Tg at third position-Tg 3 in extracts. In addition, the ability of purified NHEJ proteins Ku, DNAPKcs and XRCC 4 /Ligase IV, to repair the Tg 1 (Tg at the end), Tg 2 (Tg at the second position), Tg 3 and Tg 5 in the presence and absence of XLF was assessed. The data indicated that the cell extract could ligate the Tg 5 plasmids only in the presence of XLF. End joining of the Tg 5 was less in comparison to Tg 3 with base excision repair being more active in Tg 5 competing with the joining. Plasmids with Tg were treated with Endonuclease III and ddTTP to test whether the end joining occurred before or after Tg removal. Endonuclease III and ddTTP treatment showed reduced intensity of the joined fragment suggesting that end joining occurred without removal of Tg in some cases. The extracts were not able to fill in the processed end by the BER though it has a 3 ′-OH which was filled in by the treatment with <b>Klenow</b> <b>enzymes</b> derived from E. coli DNA Polymerase I, following removal of extract proteins by proteolysis. When purified proteins were used to treat the plasmids, it is observed that there was increased efficiency of repair with increased distance of the Tg from the end may be due to less distortion of the ends as Tg is away from the end. While Tg 1 and Tg 2 required XLF presence for the repair, Tg 3 and Tg 5 could show a small amount of repair in its absence. XLF enhanced the repair of Tg 3 and Tg 5. While the repair by extract showed no repair in the same substrates without XLF, there was repair by purified proteins without XLF, suggesting there is some competition with the XRCC 4 /Ligase for the DSB by other proteins and XLF is required to overcome this. In conclusion, cell extract was able to ligate the plasmid with Tg located at fifth position from the DSB but with lower efficiency compared to Tg 3 plasmids. The base excision repair pathway is more functional if the modified base is far from the DSB. End joining by the purified proteins was proportional to the thymine glycol position from the DSB end. XLF was mandatory for repair of Tg 1 and Tg 2 by the purified proteins, and not for Tg 3 and Tg 5...|$|R

There is controversy about the DNA Pol III assembly for the simultaneous control of lagging and leading strands replication, since some Authors propose a dimeric model with two cores, whereas others have assembled in vitro a trimeric DNA Pol III with a third catalytic core, which increases the efficiency of DNA replication. Moreover, {{the function of the}} PHP domain, located at the N-terminus of α subunit, is still unknown. Previous studies hypothesized a possible pyrophosphatase activity, not confirmed yet. The present Thesis highlights by the first time the production in vivo of a trimeric E. coli DNA Pol III by co-expressing α, τ, ε and θ subunits. This trimeric complex has been enzymatically characterized and a molecular model has been proposed, with 2 α subunits sustaining the lagging-strand replication whereas the third core replicates the leading strand. In addition, the pyrophosphatase activity of the PHP domain has been confirmed. This activity involves, at least, the H 12 and the D 19 residues, whereas the D 201 regulates phosphate release.

No. S 4117)) ### (3) Hybridization - (a) hybridization buffer: - 15 µl 20 x SSC - 45 µl 30 % Dextran Sulphate - (b) hybridization mixture: - 30 µl hybridization buffer (from 3. a) - 20 µl labelled probe redissolved in formamide (from 2. d) - (c) denature the hybridization mixture at 72 oC for 10 minutes - (d) denature the chromosome spread as folows: - 0. 05 M NaOH in 2 x SSC - 4. 5 minutes - 70 % ethanol - 5 minutes - 99. 5 % ethanol - 5 minutes - air dry - (e) apply the denatured probe to the chromosome spread, cover with parafilm (acting as a coverslip) and incubate in a humid chamber at 37 oC for 12 - 16 hours ### (4) Post-hybridisation treatment / detection - (a) wash: - 40 % formamide (standard grade) in 2 x SSC at 45 oC for 10 minutes - 2 x SSC at 45 oC for 10 minutes - 2 x SSC at room temperature for 10 minutes - (b) immersion and blocking: - BN buffer (0. 1 M NaHCO 3 / 0. 1 % NP- 40) or BI buffer (0. 1 M NaHCO 3 / 0. 1 % IGEPAL CA- 630 (Sigma I- 3021 (as NP- 40 may no longer be available))) for 5 minutes - 5 % non fat milk in BN or BI buffer for 10 minutes - (c) detection: - 50 µl of 5 % non fat milk in BN or BI buffer containing 4 µg FITC-Avidin (Vector Labs, DCS grade) for 60 minutes - (d) wash in BN or BI buffer, 2 x 10 minutes, with gentle shaking - (e) mount in antifade solution containing PI and DAPI as counterstain...|$|E
