5|$|A {{measure of}} William's success in taking control is that, from 1072 until the Capetian conquest of Normandy in 1204, William and his successors were largely {{absentee}} rulers. For example, after 1072, William {{spent more than}} 75 per cent {{of his time in}} France rather than England. While he needed to be personally present in Normandy to defend the realm from foreign invasion and put down internal revolts, he set up royal administrative structures that enabled him to rule England <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E

5|$|Nevada was refloated on 12 February 1942 and {{underwent}} temporary repairs at Pearl Harbor so {{she could}} get to Puget Sound Navy Yard for a major overhaul and modernization. This was completed in October 1942, and it changed the old battleship's appearance so she slightly resembled a South Dakota <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>distance.</b> Her 5"/51s and 5"/25s were replaced with sixteen 5"/38 caliber guns in new twin mounts.
