40|$|Purpose – Establishing {{toughness}} {{performance in}} concrete using steel fibres is well understood, and design guides {{are available to}} assist with this process. What is less readily understood {{is the use of}} Type 2 <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> to provide toughness. This problem is exacerbated by the wide range of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> available, with each different fibre providing different structural properties. This paper seeks to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines the relative pull-out values of two single fibre types, i. e. steel and Type 2 <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres.</b> The pull-out test results have informed the doses of fibre additions to beams which have been used to equate near equal toughness performance for each fibre type. Findings – The results show that <b>synthetic</b> Type 2 <b>fibres,</b> when used at a prescribed additional volume, can provide toughness equal to steel fibre concrete. Originality/value – The scientific study of fibre pull-out behaviour is well understood and described herein under additional reading. Practical testing to show contractors and clients how to balance the dose of fibres in concrete, so that <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> {{could be used as a}} steel fibre replacement, is not well researched.

In this study, we aimed to determine some using performance properties of the fabrics knitted from natural fibres such as cotton, wool and regenerated fibres such as bamboo, and also conventional and new generated <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> such as Coolmax polyester etc. For this aim, we focus on air permeability, water vapour permeability, water absorption, fire retardant property and also pilling behaviour of these fabrics.

Also all yarns were knitted with the same fabric structure and loop density. Keywords- Cotton, bamboo, new generated fibres, air permeability...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{reports the}} results of {{experimental}} programme focused {{on the effect of}} various <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> on fracture properties and ductility of concrete. The fracture energy was assessed on beams with initial notches in three-point bend test. The incorporation of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> had a slight effect on mechanical properties of concrete but, at the same time, it had a significant influence on the fracture energy by modification of post-cracking behaviour of concrete. It was found that the modern <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> might be able to impart significant toughness and ductility to concrete. However, the beneficial effect of fibres depends on their length and flexibility. The analysis of load-deflection curves obtained made it possible to fit the simple function, describing the post-peak behaviour of fibre reinforced concrete, which can be useful for the calculation of G F value.

30|$|Moreover, {{synthetic}} textiles are {{an important}} source of microplastics. In 2013, 54.4 million t of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> were produced worldwide with PES (44.6 million t) being the dominant fibre type [80]. Browne et al.

40|$|In {{the scope}} of this {{research}} project, self nucleating <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced polypropylene compounds are prepared. Their crystallization behaviour is investigated in order to characterize their material properties. This <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> were prepared by processing nucleation active polymers on the basis of high module and partly crystalline polyesters such as poly(ethylene terephthalate), LCP modified poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(ethylene- 2, 6 -naphthalate) and poly(cyclohexyldimethyl terephthalate). Different compounds with isotactic polypropylene are deformed by variation of sort and portion of <b>fibres.</b> Some <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> habe a nucleating effect on the crystallization of the polymeric matrix polypropylene under technical conditions of processing. Furthermore, it was found, that certain compounds influence the properties of these materials by an improved fibre-matrix adhesion due to transcrystallisation processes. The resulting products have improved properties by addition of nucleation active <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> with their stiffness-tenacity profile. Furthermore, investigations of crystallisation are performed using polarization microscopy. These investigations result into the finding that the characteristic values depend not only on the reinforcement effect of added filaments but also on the interactions at the interfaces in the network of material. Scanning electron microscopical analysis reveal an increased adhesion of fibres on matrix.
