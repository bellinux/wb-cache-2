5000|$|... "Drainers" [...] are {{humans who}} attack vampires {{in order to}} drain their blood, {{though it is a}} {{hazardous}} job. <b>Drainers</b> travel in teams, singling out vampires through a variety of methods and then carefully planning their ambush.

After first meeting Bill, Sookie saves him from the Rattrays, a couple of <b>drainers</b> (people who steal blood from vampires). Then, Sookie realizes she cannot read the minds of vampires. Bill returns the favor several days later when the Rattrays attack Sookie, in revenge. Sookie ends up seriously wounded, but Bill gives her his blood, so she can heal quickly.|$|R

These three models were called the Open Sailer, the Self <b>Drainer,</b> and the Fully Decked Model. The fully decked model did not appeal to the go-fast boys and, although the self <b>drainer</b> was popular, the VJ self <b>drainer</b> was well established therefore the emphasis was put on a boat which, firstly, had to be expertly sailed to stay afloat and, secondly, {{would serve as a}} trainer for the open skiff classes — so the open sailer it had to be.|$|E

50|$|In this universe, {{the effects}} of vampire blood in humans are {{feelings}} of power, increased strength, acute vision and hearing, increased sexual desire, and enhanced physical appearance. The results are notoriously unpredictable and vary per person, lasting from weeks to months. Some people go mad—even homicidal—when the blood hits their systems. Vampires hate <b>drainers</b> and the users of the drained blood. A vial of blood can cost from $200 to $400, depending on {{the age of the}} vampire and the preference of the seller.|$|R

He helped invent a power <b>drainer</b> based on a prototype made by Iron Man. When the Hood lost his powers after being defeated by the New Avengers, Harrow attempted to use the power <b>drainer</b> as a bargaining chip to replace the Hood among Norman Osborn's Cabal. Osborn called Harrow in to operate on Luke Cage, and secretly plants a miniature bomb on Cage's heart. However, the Hood soon returned, with new powers granted by the Norse Norn Stones, and blows Harrow's head off with a single magically-charged bullet. His death served as warning to any villain on his side that attempts to double-cross him.|$|E
50|$|The 1722 chapel of St James, by William Sands senior of Spalding, was a rebuild of {{an earlier}} chapel, and was {{enlarged}} in 1886. In 1896 Moulton Chapel became a separate ecclesiastical parish {{under the name of}} Moulton St James. Pevsner notes the church as a red-brick octagon with a chancel added in 1886, and a domed interior. The style is Dutch, influenced by late 17th-century fen <b>drainers.</b> There is a marble font, and a west gallery probably from the 19th century. St James' is a Grade II* listed building.|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{continued}} evolution of mobile communication technologies, cellular and other wireless networks are becoming more complex overtime. Moreover, with increasing availability of wireless interfaces like cellular networks (GPRS/EDGE/ 3 G/ 4 G) and Wi-Fi, use of rich mobile applications such as social networking applications, data transfer applications, location-aware services etc. has also increased. These wireless interfaces are major power <b>drainers</b> in mobile devices and continuous network activity consumes {{a significant portion of}} the device battery. Cellular network consumes less amount of energy as compared to Wi-Fi to keep it continuously awake. However, Wi-Fi requires very less energy to transfer the data as compared to cellular networks. In addition, cellular network is available almost everywhere whereas Wi-Fi is not and the strength of Wi-Fi varies from location to location (Ljung 2011).|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{e-government}} efforts {{around the}} world have been sporadic and unplanned. “Technological thrust ” rather than “citizen orientation ” has been the driving force for most of these initiatives. This paper provides a comprehensive e-government transformation framework, which views this change as a “guided evolution ” contingent upon the presence of certain “enablers”. E-government initiatives present the opportunity to reengineer the government processes, procedures and systems, which not only provide an enhanced value to the citizens but also increase the business productivity. The proposed framework explores the journey of e-government transformation through the six milestones namely- operation, uni-directional information flow, multi-directional information flow, service delivery, automated transaction and integrated transaction. We also describe the five “enablers ” and the four typical “resource <b>drainers</b> ” associated with e-government transformation...|$|R

60|$|Thorn {{went home}} and waited, {{confident}} that Osborn would presently send for him. The estate was heavily mortgaged, Osborn had no rich friends, and when the blow fell would look to Thorn for the aid nobody else could give. In the meantime, Osborn, enjoying a short relief from financial strain, squandered in personal extravagance part of the sum he had borrowed, and then set <b>drainers,</b> carpenters, and builders to work. He liked spending and now tried to persuade himself that the money he was laying out would give him some return. It ought to last until he had finished the renovations his tenants demanded, and although difficulties might arise afterwards, he would wait until they did. Indeed, {{his wife and daughter}} found him better humored than he had been for long.|$|R
40|$|The {{wetlands}} {{of eastern}} Europe are either marhes or fens. The former include areas of coastal silt and clay, usually located within former estuaries or behind spits of sands and single. The latter are areas of peat soil that usually lay inland from coastal marshes. In the 17 th century, the Great Level which formed the southern and central {{portion of the}} Fens were the main target for <b>drainers.</b> It was here that Dutch engineers left their greatest mark on the English landscape. Due to economic factors and of consequent lack of investment in the maintenance or improvement of drainage works, achievements by Dutch engineers in the middle decades of the 17 th century were followed by a period of deterioration. The chronology of wetland drainage in England in all periods was attributed to a complex mixture of economic, social, and technological factors...|$|R
5000|$|The {{downstream}} {{end of the}} Little Ouse has changed much over the centuries. In the Fens and Norfolk Marshland, it was quite possible for {{the course of a}} river to change {{as the result of a}} flooding episode so it is not surprising to find that the Great Ouse used to enter The Wash by way of the Old Croft River, the Wellstream and Wisbech (the Ouse beach). The modern lower Great Ouse was then the lower part of the Little Ouse. On this occasion, the change was artificial. The 17th century <b>drainers</b> under Cornelius Vermuyden dug the Old Bedford River between the Great Ouse at Earith and what had hitherto been the Little Ouse at Denver. A link was made for the Great Ouse between Littleport 1 and the Little Ouse at Brandon Creek (...) and both the drainage and the navigationwere directed towards King's Lynn rather than Wisbech.|$|R

30|$|Although widely {{documented}} in press and elsewhere, very little quantitative {{research has been}} done on China’s “sea turtles” 2. This is probably because there is little data available that tracks Chinese returnees and their work statuses, and the group of “sea turtles” is not sizable enough to yield informative inference when compared with the whole labor force. However, it is evident that China is eager to make the best use of its highly-educated brain <b>drainers</b> who are close to the world’s technology frontier, and has been implementing policy instruments to attract them back and keep them to stay 3. The main motivation of this paper is thus to have one step forward {{to know more about the}} “sea turtles,” add a China’s perspective to the bigger picture of the international brain circulation, and provide some policy implications to China and similar emerging economies, which have huge demand for creative minds and entrepreneurial skills to fuel their economic growth.|$|R
40|$|Existing {{studies on}} Canada's brain drain have {{established}} {{the importance of}} income gains as a critical factor that motivates individuals {{to move to the}} United States. It remains unclear, however, how sizable the earnings gap may be for recent post-secondary graduates and whether or not this gap varies by the field of study of the most common <b>drainers.</b> Drawing on the most recent National Graduates Survey (NGS), this study compares the early labour market earnings of the 2000 cohort of university graduates who remained in Canada to their counterparts who obtained employment in the United States. Our results indicate that only a small proportion of this cohort migrated south of the border, yet the great majority of these migrants are heavily concentrated in only a few knowledge-economy fields. Annual earnings are significantly higher for all individuals who relocated to the United States. Moreover, these differences are most salient among undergraduate engineers and computer scientists. ...|$|R

40|$|Brain Circulation {{between the}} European Union (EU) and Sub-Saharan Africa {{is a crucial}} {{ingredient}} in Human Capital formation in the latter. A major constraint to African development is the very low base of skilled and highly educated workers and professionals. The production of skilled workers has been low, and only recently has seen a dramatic increase. Recent papers by many authors have indicated that a channel for human capital growth has been, paradoxically, {{the possibility of the}} brain drain which serves as both an incentive mechanism and which results in higher human capital when the <b>drainers</b> return. After a review of some of the literature, these insights are applied to the debates raging today on European Union migration policy: the Blue Card, Migration Con-tracts, anti-Brain Drain legislation, etc. This paper argues that a careful calibration of the EU policies may enable faster Human Capital growth in Africa, while, at the same time, being beneficial to the EU by supplying critically needed skills into the EU economy. By carefully planning the production of human capital and the consequent flow of skilled migrants into Europe, the EU can assist in the development of vitally needed numbers of trained or skilled workers in Africa. ...|$|R

It is not often conceived how large a portion of the life of to-day could be rescued from such a wreck. Here may be found bones of animals by the cartload, and the hard parts and druit of vegetation, both terrestrial and aquatic. The principal non-marine mollusca are also represented, although the majority of shels are usually of aquatic species. To appreciate the profusion of these relics one need only travel for the same period over land-surfaces and note the difference of the result.

The ocean-like appearance of this southern view is even more conspicuous in the heavens than on the land, the clouds arranging themselves after a singularly sea-scape fashion. Endless strata run in parallel ribbons over the extreme horizon; above these, scattered cumuli, also in horizontal lines, are dotted against a clear grey sky, which gradually, as the eye is lifted, passes into a deep cloudless blue vault, continuously clear to the zenith; there the cumuli, in white fleecy masses, again appear; till, in the northern celestial hemisphere, they thicken and assume the leaden hue of nimbi, discharging their moisture on the dark forest-clad hills around. The breezes are south-easterly, bringing that vapour from the Indian Ocean, which is rarefied and suspended aloft over the heated plains, but condensed into a drizzle when it strikes the cooler flanks of the hills, and into heavy rain when it meets their still colder summits. Upon what a gigantic scale does nature here operate! Vapours, raised from an ocean whose nearest shore is more than 400 miles distant, are safely transported without the loss of one drop of water, to support the rank luxuriance of this far distant region. This and other offices fulfilled, the waste waters are returned, by the Cosi and Teesta, to the ocean, and again exhaled, exported, expended, re-collected, and returned.|$|R
