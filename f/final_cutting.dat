2500|$|An ambitious project {{involving}} preserved Class 50s was [...] "Operation Collingwood", {{an engineering}} charity {{established in the}} early 1990s. [...] The aim had been to train young engineering apprentices by getting them to rebuild railway locomotives and Class 50s were chosen both {{for the fact that}} they were a British design throughout and that all were named (so the apprentices would derive some pride from rededication ceremonies at the completion of their work). To this end, Operation Collingwood purchased and stored 50001, 50023, 50029, 50030, 50040 and 50045. All except 50029 and 50030 were heavily stripped examples sold to scrapyards for <b>final</b> <b>cutting</b> up. The intention was to restore them by using industrial sponsorship money to build an engineering centre and overhaul the components, making brand new ones where necessary to overcome lack of availability of some parts unique to the original design. These ambitions failed when sponsorship did not reach the required level and the project lost various key people. The charity was wound up in 2002; 50001/023/040 and 045 were sold back to scrapyards and their state as little more than bodyshells deterred most further preservation attempts. 50045 was scrapped to provide spares for preserved 50026, and 50001 met a similar fate. A private individual made an attempt to restore 50023 using some parts from 50001 but this was abandoned and the shell was cut up a few years after the initial purchase. [...] 50040 could have been suitable for cosmetic restoration, but after many years untouched and in a derelict state at the Coventry Railway Centre, it finally had all remaining parts stripped for spares and was transported to Sims Metals of Halesowen and scrapping. The cutting of the derelict hulk was completed by Wednesday 2 July 2008. [...] 50029 and 50030 were in far better mechanical condition, and were sold to a preservation group for full restoration.|$|E

30|$|Operations on {{forest land}} lead {{to changes in}} land cover and soil conditions. Intensive land {{management}} such as removing vegetation (e.g. <b>final</b> <b>cuttings)</b> exposes terrains to water and wind induced erosion. Particularly erosion is a critical ecological problem in areas with steep slopes. Erosion risks are much dependent on site specific factors; however, current methods for assessing such risk are somewhat limited (Pawelzik et al. 2013). In Finland, operations such as ditching of peatland and maintenance of ditches as well as preparation of soil for reforestation can cause erosion, which could be prevented by water protection methods (Haahti et al. 2014). In general, soil erosion is not regarded as a significant problem in Finnish forests.|$|R

40|$|Integrating the {{planning}} and implementation of wood-based fuel production with the procurement of industrial round wood in conventional forestry {{is considered to be}} a feasible undertaking. When doing so, the logging sites potentially serving as sources of biomass residues to be salvaged for fuel need to be chosen on the basis of harvesting costs. It is essential to take carefully into account site-based cost factors such as the total volume of wood to be obtained from the site, site conditions, available equipment and operating technologies, off-road haulage and truck transportation distances, storage, and quality control. In addition, ecological sustainability, possibilities to concentrate operations, seasonal variation in consumption, and the wishes of land-owners also affect the choice of harvesting sites. An important factor is the scale of operation. Harvesting machinery is expensive and thus the annual output considerably affects the costs. In addition, the greater the share of the potential fuel supply recovered, the higher the cost of procurement. This is due to longer transport distances and the need to operate on less favourable sites. As regards deliveries of different wood fuels or fuel mixtures, the quality of the fuel and the demands of energy-generation plants should be also considered. The present situation in Finland and Sweden is such that the wood fuel delivered directly from the forest to users is recovered almost solely from <b>final</b> <b>cuttings</b> in the form of logging residues. Wood fuel obtained from thinning operations is of minor importance...|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} wood profile, {{all over}} its life cycle, {{is a subject}} of interest for industries within the forest sector. Douglas-fir is a wood species with multiple applications and high productivity. In Europe, France is {{the country with the}} largest area dedicated to the cultivation of this tree species. This study aims to quantify the Douglas-fir forestry environmental impacts under different management practices performed in France. This study presents detailed life cycle inventories of both intensive and extensive scenarios, including all the processes from site preparation to logging activities. The results showed that stand establishment operations, tending and logging were the main stages responsible for the environmental impacts in both scenarios. The requirement of numerous thinning steps prior to the <b>final</b> <b>cutting,</b> which require machines with large fuel consumption, also had a negative influence. The logging stage, which includes the <b>final</b> <b>cutting</b> and the corresponding forwarding and loading onto trucks, also accounted for a significant contribution to all the categories.

40|$|In the future, the {{building}} industries will need predict-able, homogeneous and cost-competitive wood products with structural safety in increasing quantity and quality. This {{can be provided}} by, e. g., breaking solid wood and reconstructing the structure {{in a way that}} the degrading influence of knots, cracks, decay and other natural ir-regularities in wood will be eliminated. Beams, panels or boards made by this principle are called the engineered wood products (EWP). The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibilities to utilize small-diameter Scots pine and birch timber for production of EWPs that are reconstituted of strands. The wood technological char-acteristics of the tree species used in these products worldwide were studied based on the literature, and the findings were compared to the characteristics of domes-tic woods. In addition, test specimens were manufactured from domestic raw materials of Scots pine and birch spe-cies, and tested in order to examine the differences be-tween woods from young trees from the first commercial thinnings and top sections of mature trees from <b>final</b> <b>cuttings</b> as a raw material. According to the literature review, the average basic density and, consequently, many mechanical properties of pine and birch grown in Finland do not markedly differ from those of the numerous for-eign species used for EWPs. The empirical tests indi-cated that beams (air-dry density ca. 620 - 800 kgm- 3) with relatively auspicious static stiffness (ca. 6000 - 8500 MPa) and bending strength (ca. 32 - 42 MPa) could be manufac-tured from timber equal to or smaller than pulpwood in diameter...|$|R

A randomized block design was used with one block in each stand and the treatments SGH and DGH, respectively. The stands were characterized by dense to relatively dense advanced regeneration under approximately 200 trees/ha. No {{significant differences were found}} in mean harvesting time between SGH and DGH or between stands. Fewer trees, but approximately the same volume per hour, were harvested when shelterwood stands were cut as compared with clear-cutting of ordinary stands.
