50|$|A laser <b>engraving</b> <b>machine</b> can {{be thought}} of as three main parts: a laser, a {{controller}}, and a surface. The laser is like a pencil - the beam emitted from it allows the controller to trace patterns onto the surface. The controller (usually a computer) controls the direction, intensity, speed of movement, and spread of the laser beam aimed at the surface. The surface is picked to match what the laser can act on.|$|E

He created small {{photoengraving}} {{machines that}} could be used by small town newspapers to print photographs and patented several of these photo <b>engraving</b> <b>machines.</b> Martz quickly realized in order to sell his machines to newspapers, he would need trained photographers to help create the demand.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to hand engraving, there are <b>engraving</b> <b>machines</b> that require less human finesse {{and are not}} directly controlled by hand. They are usually used for lettering, using a pantographic system. There are versions for the insides of rings and also the outsides of larger pieces. Such machines are commonly used for inscriptions on rings, lockets and presentation pieces.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in the 1890s, each {{character}} was drawn {{in a very}} large size for the American Type Founders Corporation {{and a few others}} using their technology—over a foot (30 cm) high. The outline was then traced by a Benton pantograph-based <b>engraving</b> <b>machine</b> with a pointer at the hand-held vertex and a cutting tool at the opposite vertex down to a size usually less than a quarter-inch (6 mm). The pantographic engraver was first used to cut punches, and later to directly create matrices.|$|E
50|$|In another {{application}} {{similar to}} drafting, the pantograph is {{incorporated into a}} pantograph <b>engraving</b> <b>machine</b> with a revolving cutter instead of a pen, and a tray at the pointer end to fix precut lettered plates (referred to as 'copy'), which the pointer follows and thus the cutter, via the pantograph, reproduces the 'copy' at a ratio to which the pantograph arms have been set. The typical range of ratio is Maximum 1:1 Minimum 50:1 (reduction) In this way machinists can neatly and accurately engrave numbers and letters onto a part. Pantographs are no longer commonly used in modern engraving, with computerized laser and rotary engraving taking favor.|$|E
5000|$|From the {{beginning}} of the nineteenth century, new tools made engraving much easier and more exact. The ruling machine created parallel straight or wavy lines very close together, usually for use with etching. [...] Another of these tools is the geometric lathe. The lathe is used to engrave images on plates, which are in turn engraved on rolls for such uses as printing banknotes. Another of these tools is the <b>engraving</b> <b>machine.</b> This machine uses a master template to lightly engrave a duplicate image which can be then engraved by hand or etched with acid. The machine also makes possible the reduction or enlargement of the letter for the duplicate image.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of the electronic, {{transistorized}} calculator in the 1970s, slide rules became obsolete for most uses. Slide rules had never been very profitable for K & E, so it was not difficult to discontinue the line. K & E's market share shrank because of other technological advancements, and the firm shut down its slide-rule <b>engraving</b> <b>machines</b> in 1975.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Engraving</b> <b>machines</b> {{such as the}} K500 (packaging) or K6 (publication) by Hell Gravure Systems use {{a diamond}} stylus to cut cells. Each cell creates one {{printing}} dot later in the process. A K6 can have up to 18 engraving heads each cutting 8.000 cells per second to an accuracy of [...]1µm and below. They are fully computer-controlled and {{the whole process of}} cylinder-making is fully automated.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "modern signwriters" [...] is misleading, as most {{do not use}} the {{traditional}} brush as method of application. Many use vinyl masking screens in order to replicate traditional signwriting.

50|$|In {{addition}} to his strong aesthetic design sense, Benton was {{a master of the}} technology of his day. He read mechanical engineering at Cornell University, graduating in 1896. His father, Linn Boyd Benton, invented the pantographic <b>engraving</b> <b>machine,</b> which was capable not only of scaling a single font design pattern to a variety of sizes while compensating for the size change, but could also condense, extend, and slant the design (mathematically, these are cases of affine transformation, which is the fundamental geometric operation of most systems of digital typography today, including PostScript). Morris used these machines with his father at ATF, during which these machines were refined to an impressive level of precision.|$|E
5000|$|Dedicated to {{stopping}} counterfeiters, Ormsby {{invented the}} “grammagraph", a machine used to copy medals and medallions onto bank note dies {{in order to}} give the illusion of a bas-relief. The device was later used as a pantographic <b>engraving</b> <b>machine</b> to produce [...] "roll-die" [...] engraving on metal. The machine automated an existing engraving technique that varied spaces between parallel contour lines to give the impression of depth to a print. In Ormsby's case this was most famously used on the cylinders of revolvers made by Samuel Colt of Colt Firearms. Ormsby produced half a dozen engraving scenes for Colt as early as 1839 and these were featured on models such as the Colt Walker, Colt Dragoon Revolver, Colt Model 1849 Pocket Revolver, Colt 1851 Navy Revolver, and Colt Model 1855 Sidehammer Pocket Revolver.|$|E
5000|$|Benton invented many of {{the most}} {{important}} type founding technologies of the day, including a mould (1882), self spacing type (1883), a punch cutter (1885), combination fractions (1895), a type dressing machine (1901), a matrix and punch-cutting machine (1906), and automatic type-caster (1907), and a lining device for engraving matrices of shaded letters (1913). One of his most famous inventions was the Benton Pantograph, an <b>engraving</b> <b>machine</b> which was capable not only of scaling a single font design pattern to a variety of sizes, but could also condense, extend, and slant the design. [...] (Mathematically, these are cases of affine transformation, which is the fundamental geometric operation of most systems of digital typography today, including PostScript.) The technology allowed metal type to be designed on large plan drawings and then cut at the desired size, rather than being hand-engraved at the desired size.|$|E
25|$|It is now common {{place for}} retail stores (mostly jewellery, {{silverware}} or award stores) {{to have a}} small computer controlled engrave on site. This enables them to personalise the products they sell. Retail <b>engraving</b> <b>machines</b> tend to be focused around ease of use for the operator {{and the ability to}} do a wide variety of items including flat metal plates, jewelry of different shapes and sizes, as well as cylindrical items such as mugs and tankards. They will typically be equipped with a computer dedicated to graphic design that will enable the operator to easily design a text or picture graphic which the software will translate into digital signals telling the <b>engraver</b> <b>machine</b> what to do. Unlike industrial engravers, retail machines are smaller and only use one diamond head. This is interchangeable so the operator can use differently shaped diamonds for different finishing effects. They will typically be able to do a variety of metals and plastics. Glass and crystal engraving is possible, but the brittle nature of the material makes the process more time consuming.|$|R
50|$|In modern engineering, {{the term}} laser {{scanning}} is used with two related, but separate meanings. The first, more general, meaning is the controlled deflection of laser beams, visible or invisible. Scanned laser beams {{are used in}} some 3-D printers, in rapid prototyping, in machines for material processing, in laser <b>engraving</b> <b>machines,</b> in ophtalmological laser systems {{for the treatment of}} presbyopia, in confocal microscopy, in laser printers, in laser shows, in Laser TV, in ceramic laser treatments, and in barcode scanners.|$|R

5000|$|Goudy {{used the}} font to set his book Typologia (1940) which was printed by the University of California Press {{in the new}} font, and he {{describes}} his inspiration {{for it in the}} chapter The Story of a Type. He described it as particularly intended to be intended to be attractive in mass and said that the italic was intended to be [...] "a refined letter, yet not, I hope, one which may be called prudish…some letters are a bit exuberant. As an italic is used to emphasise a word…or sometimes merely to give a lighter touch, I have allowed myself to incorporate here and there in my font some forms more or less fanciful." [...] It was finished just before a fire that destroyed Goudy's workshop, <b>engraving</b> <b>machine</b> and plan drawings, and Goudy noted in his book that it was lucky that he had posted off finished work to Monotype to use as a basis for making punches for their hot metal typesetting system, allowing some letters to be redrawn from patterns.|$|E

50|$|Since its {{inception}} in the late 1990s, SSLE has become more cost effective {{with a number of}} different sized machines ranging from small (~US$35,000-60,000) to large production sized tables (>US$250,000). Although these machines are becoming more available, it is estimated that only a few hundred are in operation worldwide. Many machines require very expensive cooling, maintenance and calibration for proper use. The more popular SSLE <b>engraving</b> <b>machines</b> use the Diode Pumped Solid State or DPSS laser process. The laser diode, the primary component which excites a pulsed solid state laser, can easily cost one third of the machine itself and functions for a limited number of hours, although a good quality diode can last thousands of hours.|$|R
