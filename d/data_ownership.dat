50|$|Data {{provenance}} {{covers the}} provenance of computerized data. There {{are two main}} aspects of <b>data</b> provenance: <b>ownership</b> of the <b>data</b> and <b>data</b> usage. <b>Ownership</b> will tell the user {{who is responsible for}} the source of the data, ideally including information on the originator of the data. Data usage gives details regarding how the data has been used and modified and often includes information on how to cite the data source or sources. Data provenance is of particular concern with electronic data, as data sets are often modified and copied without proper citation or acknowledgement of the originating data set. Databases make it easy to select specific information from data sets and merge this data with other data sources without any documentation of how the data was obtained or how it was modified from the original data set or sets.|$|R

30|$|The {{institutional}} shareholdings {{data are}} drawn from the Thomson One Ownership Module. This database contains global shareholding information, including <b>data</b> on <b>ownership</b> of equities from over 70 countries and institutional portfolios from over 27 countries. 5 The institutions covered in the database are professional money managers such as mutual funds, hedge funds, pension funds, bank trusts, and insurance companies. We use institutional <b>ownership</b> <b>data</b> for the period from 1997 to 2006 and extract financial statements data from Worldscope. We collect the following data items from Datastream: the weekly return index (RI), the market return index (MI), the exchange rate, the share price (P), the number of shares outstanding (NOSH), and the trading volume (VO). These data are necessary to compute firm-specific return comovement, trading turnover, and future returns for individual stocks.|$|R
50|$|Faitelson and Korkus {{invented a}} {{solution}} that would retrieve metadata contained in file systems. They brought in Dr. Jacob Goldberger, an expert in statistical modeling and machine learning, to help develop the algorithms that would provide the user-data link. In 2005, Faitelson, Goldberger, and Korkus filed a patent, “Automatic management of storage access control, which was granted in 2006. The result of their work was the Intelligent Data Use (IDU) classification platform, a platform for gathering and analyzing file data use.

5000|$|Some {{critics of}} {{platform}} cooperativism claim that platform cooperatives will have trouble challenging established, venture-capital-funded platforms. Nick Srnicek writes that, due to “the monopolistic nature of platforms, {{the dominance of}} network effects, and the vast resources behind these companies … even if all that software would be made open-source, a platform like Facebook would still have the weight of its existing data, network effects, and financial resources to fight off any co-op arrival.” Evgeny Morozov writes that [...] "Efforts at platform cooperativism are worthwhile; occasionally, they do produce impressive and ethical local projects. There {{is no reason why}} a cooperative of drivers in a small town cannot build an app to help them beat Uber locally. But there is also no good reason to believe that this local cooperative can actually build a self-driving car: this requires massive investment and a dedicated infrastructure to harvest and analyse all of the data. One can, of course, also create <b>data</b> <b>ownership</b> cooperatives but it’s unlikely they will scale to a point of competing with Google or Amazon." ...|$|E

Personal <b>data</b> <b>ownership</b> and {{interoperability}} for decentral-ized social Web {{applications are}} currently two debated topics, especially when {{taking into consideration}} the aspects of privacy and access control. To increase <b>data</b> <b>ownership,</b> users should {{have the freedom to}} choose where their data resides and who is allowed access to it by decoupling data storage from the application that consumes it. Through CIMBA, we propose a decentralized architecture based on Web standards, which puts users back in control of their own data...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Current Internet trends {{have caused}} us to outgrow {{existing}} {{online data storage}} paradigms. This paper presents an extended model for distributed online data storage. The model addresses issues of data duplication, data freshness and <b>data</b> <b>ownership,</b> while facilitating two modes of data access- direct and indirect. Direct data access is implemented using advanced handoff techniques while indirect access is implemented using robust server-to-server protocols that enforce strict policies on data management. Results are presented that compare this solution to existing technologies and an example migration path is described for existing Web 2. 0 applications wishing to adopt this new paradigm.
