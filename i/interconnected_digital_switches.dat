25|$|The {{concepts}} of <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> {{were developed by}} various labs in the United States and in Europe from the 1930s onwards. The first prototype <b>digital</b> <b>switch</b> was developed by Bell Labs {{as part of the}} ESSEX project while the first true digital exchange to be combined with digital transmission systems was designed by LCT (Laboratoire Central de Telecommunications) in Paris. The first <b>digital</b> <b>switch</b> to be placed into a public network was the Empress Exchange in London, England which was designed by the General Post Office research labs. This was a tandem switch that connected three Strowger exchanges in the London area. The first commercial roll-out of a fully <b>digital</b> local <b>switching</b> system was Alcatel's E10 system which began serving customers in Brittany in Northwestern France in 1972.|$|R

40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{features}} description of electronics <b>switches</b> for <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> arrays and on the design of program for optimal calculation of switching points and the figure of <b>switches</b> in <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> arrays investigation. The electronics switches types, used for time circuit separation, are described in the preamble. These switches are the base of <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> arrays and in principal two types are defined: the switch S and switch T. The switch S allows the interconnection only of the same channel intervals from incoming circuit with random outgoing circuit. The switch S is being used in multistage switching arrays in combination with the switches T because it can not be used separately. The switch T allows exchanging the time position of incoming circuit to different time position of outgoing circuit depending on connection needs. The time switch can substitute the space switch under specific work conditions. In practice, the time switch with controlled reading and writing is used. The following part of diploma thesis {{is focused on}} the designs and calculations of optimal <b>switching</b> points of <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> array which is the executive unit of switching systems. These systems directly interconnect the signals from digital multiplexes and make the basic assumptions for telecommunication networks integration. The <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> array means the equipment which is able to connect the channels of digital multiplexes carrying the information in encoding form. The multiplexes are the most often with pulse coded modulation or adaptive delta modulation. The <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> arrays are divided into the time and space one. The <b>switching</b> arrays of <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> systems can be made by time switching array T whose realization is limited to specific capacity or by the connection of multistage arrays. Single stages sequenced one behind each other are made by the switches T and S. The space array S does not allow making the <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> array of switching centre. The program which determines possible proposals of switching arrays from defined figure of inputs and calculates the optimal figure of switching points and switches is a part of diploma thesis...|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 27 - 30, 1997 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaThis paper {{describes}} {{the status of}} the Edwards <b>Digital</b> <b>Switch</b> (EDS) [1] and the success of the <b>Digital</b> <b>Switch</b> Sustainment Program (DSSP); a multi-service program aimed at cost-effective means for providing maintenance and development of an advanced <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> system. This <b>digital</b> communications <b>switching</b> system is deployed at the mission control centers of Edwards AFB, Eglin AFB, and China Lake Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC). Each system provides the test ranges with mission-critical voice communications and Time Space Position Information (TSPI) switching. Through user-friendly Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), the switch provides exceptional resource management of radios, telephones, user positions, secure communications, radars, trackers, 4 -wire Ear & Mouth (E&M) devices, subscriber services, and other equipment. Developed using commercial equipment, such as the Lucent Technologies Digital Access and Cross-Connect System (DACS) II, the <b>digital</b> <b>switch</b> can integrate and interface with the technologies of other test ranges and customers. The DSSP sustaining engineering contract, a 10 M contract awarded in 1997, is a multi-service effort in supporting cost effective maintenance and enhancement for the systems’ software and hardware. Eglin and China Lake have agreed to participate in a <b>Digital</b> <b>Switch</b> Working Group (DSWG) to ensure that this configuration management is in place and that all players follow the same system migration path. These ranges and other interested ranges that agree to purchase systems off the contract and participate in the working group will continue to derive benefits by reducing overhead and eliminating the duplication of effort involved in separate endeavors...|$|R
