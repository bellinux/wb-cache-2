Resources are already seriously limited and are far below under the water poverty line of (1000) m 3 per capita per year. On a per capita basis, available water from existing renewable sources is projected to fall from (150) m 3 /capita/year in year (2003) to (90) m 3 /capita/year by the year (2025). Climate change(CC) is expected to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> which will reduce the per capita water share for Jordanians. To study potential impacts of climate change on hydrological system and water resources, two river basins have been selected in the territory of Jordan: the Amman- Zarqa River (3567 km 2) and the Yarmouk River (1384 km 2). To simulate potential changes in runoff the WEAP hydrological model has been applied three selected global circulation models (GCM) (HADGEM 1, CSIROMK 3 and ECHAM 5 OM) scenarios. It was found from the simulation for base scenario and GCM scenario that the available amounts of surface runoff resulted from precipitation will be highly affected by climate change.

40|$|Invited Mini-Review: Semi-arid tropics host most of {{the poor}} and {{small-holding}} farmers of the developing world. Global warming is seen largely as a consequence of continuous increase in the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere leading to unusual changes in global temperatures and rainfall patterns. This in turn is expected to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> in the environment, affecting plant growth and metabolism. In this context, we reviewed semi-arid crop responses to elevated CO 2 levels in terms of growth, yield components, physiological, biochemical and molecular changes. Predicted rise of carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere may benefit the plants by increasing the crop water use efficiency and net photosynthesis leading to greater biomass, yield and harvest index. C 3 and C 4 crop plants vary in their degree of response to elevated CO 2, which will likely affect the proportion of land area occupied by these crops in future. Stomatal conductance will probably be reduced at higher CO 2 concentrations reducing transpiration per unit leaf area and consequently increasing the leaf temperature. The high CO 2 is an ameliorative of the adverse effects of drought and acts by altering the plant, biochemical and molecular systems. Understanding of the direct effects of elevated CO 2 and its interactions with the other climate variables is needed in order to predict the impact of climate change scenarios on crop growth and food security in future. ...|$|E

However during the colonial and postcolonial regimes, in response to climate change, economic globalization, and population pressure, {{there has been a}} conscious shift from customary water management systems towards paradigms cast in the contemporary mould (legislation, policies, and institutions). These modern approaches have been shown over the years to be insufficient in ensuring water sustainability.

This paper contends that although Ghana’s water related institutions, laws, and policies are undergoing significant reforms, implementation and practice remains embedded in weak ecological modernization (EM). Institutionalizing a narrow conception of EM will only perpetuate ‘organized irresponsibility’ and permit the continued production of ecological problems, leaving open the question of whether modernization is compatible with ecological sustainability.

40|$|The use of {{reclaimed}} wastewater (RWW) for {{the irrigation}} of crops {{may result in}} the continuous exposure of the agricultural environment to antibiotics, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In recent years, certain evidence indicate that antibiotics and resistance genes may become disseminated in agricultural soils {{as a result of}} the amendment with manure and biosolids and irrigation with RWW. Antibiotic residues and other contaminants may undergo sorption/desorption and transformation processes (both biotic and abiotic), and have the potential to affect the soil microbiota. Antibiotics found in <b>the</b> soil pore <b>water</b> (bioavailable fraction) as a result of RWW irrigation may be taken up by crop plants, bioaccumulate within plant tissues and subsequently enter the food webs; potentially resulting in detrimental public health implications. It can be also hypothesized that ARGs can spread among soil and plant-associated bacteria, a fact that may have serious human health implications. The majority of studies dealing with these environmental and social challenges related with the use of RWW for irrigation were conducted under laboratory or using, somehow, controlled conditions. This critical review discusses the state of the art on the fate of antibiotics, ARB and ARGs in agricultural environment where RWW is applied for irrigation. The implications associated with the uptake of antibiotics by plants (uptake mechanisms) and the potential risks to public health are highlighted.

In this study, virtual water trade in relation to water resources availability has been assessed as a way of relaxing water stress in Iran. The results showed that from the 21 food products, cereals, pulses, nuts and oilseeds are water-intensive crops according to their estimated virtual water content, while fruits, vegetables and industrial crops are not water-intensive. Considering the volume of virtual <b>water</b> entering <b>the</b> country through food imports, more water will be available for other essential uses.

Aerobic rice, grown under aerobic {{soil conditions}} like maize or wheat, is an innovative way {{to cope with}} the growing demand for rice and <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity.</b> Weeds are <b>the</b> most severe constraint to aerobic rice. The use of herbicides causes environmental pollution and induces the proliferation of resistant weed biotypes. These risks and the costs of labor for weeding prompt research on environment-friendly and labour-efficient methods of weed control. The adoption of weed-competitive genotypes is regarded as an effective tool in integrated weed management. The main objectives of this study were to explore the feasibility of breeding for weed competitiveness, to develop an indirect selection index for the trait, and to test the efficacy of a weed-competitive genotype in weed management. Field experiments were carried out at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. Aerobic and upland genotypes were grown under aerobic conditions to study their performance under both weed-free and weedy environments. A large genetic variability within Oryza sativa both in weed-suppressive ability (WSA) and yielding ability under weed competition was detected. These two traits were moderately heritable and closely associated. Yield and early crop vigour investigated under weed-free conditions accounted for 87 % of genotypic variation in yield under weed competition and for 40 % of the variation in weed biomass; thus, weed-free yield and early crop vigour should both be included in an indirect selection index for breeding high-yielding, weed-competitive genotypes. Fast early vegetative growth rather than plant erectness was crucial to strong WSA. Indica germplasm in both yielding ability and WSA, and aus germplasm in WSA were both superior to tropical japonica germplasm and the progenies of indica /tropical japonica; thus, indica and aus germplasm may be used as gene donors for breeding for strong WSA in the tropics. The effects of genotype and seeding rate on suppressing weeds were additive; it was shown that a strongly weed-competitive genotype at an appropriate seeding rate (300 viable seeds m - 2) suppresses weeds effectively. These findings indicate that weed-competitive genotypes may contribute greatly to weed management in aerobic rice agro-ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|Chile {{contains}} {{some of the}} driest areas in the world, yet human activities in these areas require large volumes of <b>water,</b> <b>the</b> result is regions experiencing high <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> leading to environmental degradation, conflicts and reduced industrial productivity. The aim {{of this paper was}} to quantify <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> in <b>the</b> central and northern regions by calculating <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> index—the ratio of annual water demand to availability. A focus of the paper was to determine the impact of the main industries in each region and investigate the benefit of implementing water reduction strategies within these industries. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> resources of each investigated region were found to be greatly overexploited and particularly so in the region of Antofagasta. The mining industry was found to be <b>the</b> greatest <b>water</b> consuming sector in this region and further analysis demonstrated that <b>the</b> degree of <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> could be greatly reduced by <b>the</b> implementation of <b>water</b> reduction strategies. <b>The</b> agricultural sector dominated water demand in all other regions and it was found that upgrading irrigation efficiency alongside reducing consumption in mining improved the situation in all regions. Nevertheless, given <b>the</b> scale of <b>water</b> <b>scarcity,</b> further investigation is necessary to obtain more recent and accurate data and analyze alternative strategies...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the number}} of Refugees of the Syrian Civil War in Lebanon rises, Lebanon {{continues}} to face more major challenges to its food and <b>water</b> security. <b>The</b> refugee situation is placing tremendous pressure on the country's resources. There are serious changes in Lebanon's water availability and agricultural production {{as a result of}} climate change and population growth, making it more difficult to fulfill the needs of refugees. More than 40% of farmers in Kfardebian and 81% in the Beqa'a region have reported water shortages being exacerbated by the region's close proximity to Syria and the influx of refugees. <b>Water</b> <b>scarcity</b> affects <b>the</b> quantity and quality of <b>water</b> available to <b>the</b> villages, food security, and land availability for living and for cultivating. The influx of Syrian refugees is not something the Lebanese government could have reasonably prepared for as it happened so rapidly, but international aid has proven to also be inadequate for the scale of the crisis, especially in the Beqa'a and Northern Lebanon region, which borders closely with Syria. Arrivals of refugees to Lebanon grew at an unprecedented pace in 2013 and 2014, with an average of 47,000 refugees being registered by UNHCR per month. Close to 30 percent of the refugee population are left without access to safe drinking <b>water</b> because of <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> in <b>the</b> region. One issue with providing adequate care for the refugees is that both Syria and Lebanon have deeply divided populations, meaning that their current priorities are not climate change or population growth as much as they are regime stability and national security. Because of this priority focus away from refugees, Lebanon needs major international assistance to meet immediate humanitarian needs, as well as to strengthen water infrastructure and irrigation throughout the country. By the beginning of 2015, there were an estimated 1.3 million Syrian refugees living in Lebanon, and it is expected that this number will rise to approximately 1.8 million by December 2015. [...] "As their displacement extends and their savings deplete, refugees' socio-economic vulnerability increases." [...] Syrian refugees who were born in Lebanon are at an increased risk, as 72 percent of them do not possess official birth certificates. The majority of refugees have settled in the Beqa'a region. Because of the influx, not only has Lebanon suffered on a basis of resources and environmental stress, but Lebanon has also suffered economically through a loss of trade, tourism and investment. According to a World Bank Assessment in October 2013, the economic impact of the Syrian crisis was estimated to cost Lebanon USD 7.5 billion, and the country's GDP has plunged from 10 percent before the crisis to 2 percent currently. Public services and infrastructure as well are under severe strain {{as a result of the}} refugee influx. A vulnerability assessment conducted by the UN and partner agencies has shown that upward of 70 percent of refugees cannot meet their minimum daily food requirements. 72 percent of all refugees have been receiving monthly food assistance from WFP (World Food Programme). However, in 2015, WFP lost funding and had to reduce the value of food vouchers by 40 percent. There is a serious strain on resources in Lebanon being exacerbated by an influx of refugees in the country, and Lebanon needs more international aid in order to sustain the population in the long-term.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>water</b> {{conflict}} in <b>the</b> Aral Sea {{is an ongoing}} transboundary conflict starting from 1991 between Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Social causes such as economic development, population growth, electricity demand, and pollution has resulted in <b>water</b> <b>scarcity.</b> <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> has resulted in limited availability to allocate <b>water</b> efficiently between <b>the</b> neighboring countries. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> has impacted many aspects of life and resources such as; fish, biodiversity, water, air pollution, forestry, agricultural land and ecosystem availability. The impact of poor water politics and management has negatively influenced {{the economy of the}} surrounding countries and has created stress on resources that are crucial to the agricultural sector. Research indicates that <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> can cost regions up to 6% of their GDP and cause migration, which negatively impacts the local economy. There have been multiple attempts to resolve the conflict from different organizations such as The Interstate Commission for Water Coordination, Interstate Council of the Aral Sea, and The Aral Sea Basin Program, but the issue is still ongoing.|$|R
