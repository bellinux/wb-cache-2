5000|$|Because most <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>bases</b> contain {{multiple}} nucleophilic sites, site selectivity is {{an important}} issue in nucleoside synthesis. Purine bases, for instance, react kinetically at N3 and thermodynamically at N1 (see Eq. (4)). Glycosylation of thymine with protected 1-acetoxy ribose produced 60% of the N1 nucleoside and 23% of the N3 nucleoside. Closely related triazines, on the other hand, react with complete selectivity to afford the N2 nucleoside.(5)The most nucleophilic nitrogen can be blocked through alkylation prior to nucleoside synthesis. Heating the blocked nucleoside in Eq. (6) {{in the presence of a}} protected sugar chloride provides the nucleoside in 59% yield. Reactions of this type are hampered by alkylation of the heterocycle by incipient alkyl chloride.(6)Silylated <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>bases</b> are susceptible to hydrolysis and somewhat difficult to handle as a result; thus, the development of a one-pot, one-step method for silylation and nucleoside synthesis represented a significant advance. The combination of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl), and hexamethyldisilazide (HMDS) generates trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetate in situ, which accomplishes both the silylation of the heterocycle and its subsequent coupling with the sugar.(7) ...|$|R
5000|$|A useful {{alternative}} to the methods described here that avoids the site selectivity concerns of the SHJ reaction is tandem Michael reaction/cyclization to simultaneously form the <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>base</b> and establish its connection to the sugar moiety.(10)A second alternative is enzymatic transglycosylation, which is completely kinetically controlled (avoiding issues of chemical transglycosylation associated with thermodynamic control).

Most other transglycosylation reactions are low yielding due to a small thermodynamic difference between equilibrating nucleosides.(8)Deoxyribose-derived electrophiles are unable to form the cyclic cation 1; as a result, the stereoselective synthesis of deoxyribonucleosides is more difficult than the synthesis of ribonucleosides.
