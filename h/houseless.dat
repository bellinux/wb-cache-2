500|$|The {{history of}} a station at Watsessing Avenue in the Watsessing {{district}} of Bloomfield {{dates back to the}} Newark and Bloomfield Railroad, established in 1856. [...] The station, a <b>houseless</b> station off of Dodd Street, was deemed first as Doddtown by a railroad conductor. This name soon gave way to Watsessing, and in 1865, the line was bought by the Morris and Essex Railroad, running through trains.

2500|$|The terms {{unsheltered}} and unhoused {{refer to}} that segment of a homeless community {{who do not have}} ordinary lawful access to buildings in which to sleep; the latter term is defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as describing persons occupying [...] "place not designed for ... sleeping accommodation for human beings". [...] Such persons frequently prefer the term <b>houseless</b> to the term homeless. Recent homeless enumeration survey documentation utilizes the term unsheltered homeless. The common colloquial term street people does not fully encompass all unsheltered people, in that many such persons do not spend their time in urban street environments. Many shun such locales, because homeless people in urban environments may face the risk of being robbed or beaten up. Some people convert unoccupied or abandoned buildings ("squatting"), or inhabit mountainous areas or, more often, lowland meadows, creek banks and beaches. Many jurisdictions have developed programs to provide short-term emergency shelter during particularly cold spells, often in churches or other institutional properties. These are referred to as warming centers, and are credited by their advocates as lifesaving.|$|E
60|$|At length these {{flickering}} sparks {{would die}} away, worn out--the last veritable sparks of waking life trailed from some late pieman or hot-potato man--and London would sink to rest. And then the yearning of the <b>houseless</b> mind {{would be for}} any sign of company, any lighted place, any movement, anything suggestive of any one being up--nay, even so much as awake, for the <b>houseless</b> eye looked out for lights in windows.|$|E

6000|$|By wintry hills his hermit-mound [...] The sheeted snow-drifts drape, And <b>houseless</b> {{there the}} snow-bird flits [...] Beneath the fir-trees' crape: Glazed now with ice the cloistral vine [...] That hid the shyest grape.|$|E

6000|$|Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are, [...] That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm! [...] How shall your <b>houseless</b> heads, and unfed sides, [...] Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you [...] From seasons such as these?--Shakespeare.|$|E

6000|$|... "But I have {{no other}} course left open to me," [...] she continued. [...] "I cannot see my poor girls turned out <b>houseless</b> on the world." [...] And then, refusing even to lean on her son's arm, she stepped up heavily into the carriage, and seated herself beside the boy.|$|E
60|$|The four pushed side by side; {{the outer}} wall bulged, split, and fell, and the villagers, dumb with horror, saw the savage, clay-streaked {{heads of the}} wreckers in the ragged gap. Then they fled, <b>houseless</b> and foodless, down the valley, as their village, {{shredded}} and tossed and trampled, melted behind them.|$|E
6000|$|From a wood-hung height, an outpost lone, [...] Crowned with a woodman's fort, The {{sentinel}} {{looks on}} {{a land of}} dole, [...] Like Paran, all amort.

60|$|The lights {{began to}} twinkle, {{it came on}} to rain, the wind rose, and a raw and gusty night set in.

6000|$|The very {{mention of}} this man's {{name had been}} of late a subject {{of the most violent}} {{irritation}} to the unfortunate patient. The sound of his voice now produced an instantaneous effect. Mr. Bertram started up without assistance and turned round towards him; the ghastliness of his features forming a strange contrast with the violence of his exclamations.--'Out of my sight, ye viper! ye frozen viper, that I warmed, till ye stung me! Art thou not afraid that the walls of my father's dwelling should fall and crush thee limb and bone?

Were ye not friendless, <b>houseless,</b> penniless, when I took ye by the hand; and are ye not expelling me--me and that innocent girl--friendless, <b>houseless,</b> and penniless, from the house that has sheltered us and ours for a thousand years?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Ah! poor, <b>houseless,</b> wandering, motherless child!' {{cried the}} old man, {{clasping}} {{his hands and}} gazing {{as if for the}} first time upon her anxious face, her travel-stained dress, and bruised and swollen feet; 'has all my agony of care brought her to this at last!

60|$|In this hotel, I have a room on {{the first}} floor! Luxury, however, is not {{altogether}} regardless of expense. We only pay 13 francs per day--3-1/2 more than at the Pavillon on the third floor.--And beggars must not be choosers. We were very nearly <b>houseless,</b> the night we came. And it is rarely that such winds of adversity blow men into king's Palaces.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} prince, [...] "not {{a man of}} them shall escape alive; you yourselves shall go with your {{children}} into <b>houseless</b> and friendless banishment; but {{that you may not}} starve I grant you this one grace, that each woman may bear with her from this place as much of her most valuable property as she is able to carry." ...|$|E
6000|$|For behind {{they left}} a wailing, [...] A terror and a ban, And blazing cinders sailing, [...] And <b>houseless</b> {{households}} wan, Wide zones of counties paling, [...] And towns where maniacs ran.

6000|$|Here {{spoke the}} born explorer. His eyes sparkled, his face flushed. The farther {{we got into}} the <b>houseless</b> cattle range, the better he liked it.

60|$|In {{course of}} time {{she came into the}} leading {{thoroughfare}} where the Marshalsea was, and then he saw them slacken their pace, and soon turn down a by-street. He stopped, felt that he had no right to go further, and slowly left them. He had no suspicion that they ran any risk of being <b>houseless</b> until morning; had no idea of the truth until long, long afterwards.|$|E
60|$|Nor {{did this}} make her vain and heedless of others; she humbly dwelt among them, seeking {{to do all}} the good she might; and many a <b>houseless</b> bird and hungry insect that Thistledown had harmed did she feed and shelter, and in return no evil could befall her, for so many friends were all about her, seeking to repay her {{tenderness}} and love by their watchful care.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true, deacon; your rambling, <b>houseless</b> sailor is {{commonly}} a great liar--at least so have I always found him. Most of their log-books {{will not do}} to read; or, for that matter, to be written out, in full. But if this man's name is really Daggett, he must come from the Vineyard. There are Daggetts there in scores; yes, {{he must be a}} Vineyard man." ...|$|E
60|$|They were lazy--always lazy. Perhaps {{that was}} their trouble. It is a killing defect. Surely they could have invented and built a {{competent}} house, but they didn't.

They went naked and <b>houseless,</b> and lived on fish and grubs and worms and wild fruits, and were just plain savages, for all their smartness.|$|E
6000|$|Doctor Speddie's {{house was}} the last house in the place. Beyond it, lay the moor, all dark and lonesome. The wind moaned in a low, dull, {{shivering}} manner round the little garden, like a <b>houseless</b> creature that knew the winter was coming. It was exceedingly wild and solitary. 'Roses,' said the Doctor, when Goodchild touched some wet leaves overhanging the stone porch; 'but they get cut to pieces.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] Matt said, [...] "that {{the company}} would let them stay where they are, for the present, and that they won't be {{actually}} <b>houseless.</b> But they propose now {{to give up the}} money that their father left for their support till he could carry out the crazy schemes for retrieving himself that he speaks of in his letter; and then they will have nothing to live on." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{the mood}} would change. The city, grim and vast, {{stretched}} round me endless. I crawled, a mere atom, within its folds, helpless, insignificant, absurd. The <b>houseless</b> forms that shared my vigil were my fellows. What were we? Animalcule upon its bosom, that it saw not, heeded not. For company I would mingle with them: ragged men, frowsy women, ageless youths, gathered round the red glow of some coffee stall.|$|E
60|$|There {{were other}} prisoners—boys of ten, as {{hardened}} in vice as men of fifty—a <b>houseless</b> vagrant, going joyfully to prison {{as a place}} of food and shelter, handcuffed to a man whose prospects were ruined, character lost, and family rendered destitute, by his first offence. Our curiosity, however, was satisfied. The first group had left an impression on our mind we would gladly have avoided, and would willingly have effaced.|$|E
6000|$|The Moslem orphan {{went with}} her protector, [...] For she was homeless, <b>houseless,</b> helpless; all [...] Her friends, like the sad family of Hector, [...] Had perish'd in the field or by the wall: [...] Her very place of birth was but a spectre [...] Of what it had been; there the Muezzin's cal [...] To prayer was heard no more!--and Juan wept, [...] And made a vow to shield her, which he kept.|$|E
