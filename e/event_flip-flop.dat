40|$|AbstractCholesterol (CHOL) {{molecules}} play a {{key role}} in modulating the rigidity of cell membranes and controlling intracellular transport and signal transduction. Using an all-atom molecular dynamics approach, we study the process of CHOL interleaflet transport (flip-flop) in a dipalmitoylphosphatidycholine (DPPC) -CHOL bilayer over a time period of 15 μs. We investigate the effect of the flip-flop process on mechanical stress across the bilayer and the role of CHOL in inducing molecular order in bilayer leaflets. The simulations are carried out at physiologically relevant CHOL concentration (30 %), temperature (323 K), and pressure (1 bar). CHOL <b>flip-flop</b> <b>events</b> are observed with a rate constant of 3  × 104 s− 1. Once a <b>flip-flop</b> <b>event</b> is triggered, a CHOL molecule takes an average of 73 nanoseconds to migrate from one bilayer leaflet to the other...|$|R
40|$|NoChemical {{means of}} {{manipulating}} {{the distribution of}} lipids across biological membranes is of considerable interest for many biomedical applications as a characteristic lipid distribution is vital for numerous cellular functions. Here we employ atomic-scale molecular simulations {{to shed light on}} the ability of certain amphiphilic compounds to promote lipid translocation (flip-flops) across membranes. We show that chemically induced lipid flip-flops are most likely pore-mediated: the actual <b>flip-flop</b> <b>event</b> is a very fast process (time scales of tens of nanoseconds) once a transient water defect has been induced by the amphiphilic chemical (dimethylsulfoxide in this instance). Our findings are consistent with available experimental observations and further emphasize the importance of transient membrane defects for chemical control of lipid distribution across cell membrane...|$|R
40|$|International audienceInteractions between small organic {{molecules}} and lipid or cell membranes {{are important because}} of {{their role in the}} distribution of biologically active substances inside the membrane and their permeation through the cell membranes. In the current paper, we have explored the effect of the attachment of long hydrocarbon tails on the behavior of small organic molecule inside the lipid membrane. Naphthalene with two decyloxy groups attached at the opposite sites of the ring (2, 6 -bis(decyloxy) naphthalene, 3) was synthesized and incorporated into phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles. Fluorescence methods as well as molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were used to estimate the position, orientation, and migration of compound 3 in PC bilayer. It was found that the naphthalene ring of compound 3 resides in the upper acyl chain region of the bilayer and the hydrocarbon tails are directed {{to the center of the}} bilayer. As was shown with cryotransmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), such lipidlike conformation enables compound 3 to be incorporated into liposomes at a very high content without their disintegration. Moreover, compound 3 can migrate from one leaflet to other. The mechanism of this process is, however, different from that characteristic of the <b>flip-flop</b> <b>event</b> of lipid molecules in the membrane. Finally, the possible application of compound 3 as a rotational molecular probe for monitoring fluidity of liposomal membrane in the acyl side chain region was checked by studies of the effect of cholesterol on the fluorescence anisotropy of 3...|$|R
40|$|Transmembrane lipid {{translocation}} (flip-flop) {{processes are}} involved in a variety of properties and functions of cell membranes, such as membrane asymmetry and programmed cell death. Yet, flip-flops are one of the least understood dynamical processes in membranes. In this work, we elucidate the molecular mechanism of pore-mediated transmembrane lipid translocation (flip-flop) acquired from extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. On the basis of 50 successful <b>flip-flop</b> <b>events</b> resolved in atomic detail, we demonstrate that lipid flip-flops may spontaneously occur in protein-free phospholipid membranes under physiological conditions through transient water pores on a time scale of tens of nanoseconds. While the formation of a water pore is induced here by a transmembrane ion density gradient, the particular way by which the pore is formed is irrelevant for the reported flip-flop mechanism: the appearance of a transient pore (defect) in the membrane inevitably leads to diffusiVe translocation of lipids through the pore, which is driven by thermal fluctuations. Our findings strongly support the idea that the formation of membrane defects in terms of water pores is the rate-limiting step in the process of transmembrane lipid flip-flop, which, on average, requires several hours. The findings are consistent with available experimental and computational data and provide a view to interpret experimental observations. For example, the simulation results provide a molecular-level explanation in terms of pores for the experimentally observed fact that the exposure of lipid membranes to electric field pulses considerably reduces the time required for lipid flip-flops...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{attribute of}} cell membranes is transmembrane asymmetry, specifically {{the formation of}} ordered phase domains in one leaflet that are compositionally different from the opposing leaflet of the bilayer. Using model membrane systems, many previous studies have demonstrated the formation of ordered phase domains that display complete transmembrane symmetry {{but there have been}} few reports on the more biologically relevant asymmetric membrane structures. Here we report on a combined atomic force microscopy (AFM) and fluorescence microscopy study whereby we observe three different states of transmembrane symmetry in phase-separated supported bilayers formed by vesicle fusion. We find that if the leaflets differ in gel-phase area fraction, then the smaller domains in one leaflet are in registry with the larger domains in the other leaflet and the system is dynamic. In a presumed lipid flip-flop process similar to Ostwald Ripening, the smaller domains in one leaflet erode away while the large domains in the other leaflet grow until complete compositional asymmetry is reached and remains stable. We have quantified this evolution and determined that the lipid <b>flip-flop</b> <b>event</b> happens most frequently at the interface between symmetric and asymmetric DSPC domains. If both leaflets have nearly identical area fraction of gel-phase, gel-phase domains are in registry and are static in comparison to the first state. The stability of these three DSPC domain distributions, the degree of registry observed, and the domain immobility have direct biological significance with regards to maintenance of lipid asymmetry in living cell membranes, communication between inner leaflet and outer leaflet, membrane adhesion, and raft mobility...|$|R
40|$|HD 208472 {{is among}} the most active RS~CVn {{binaries}} with cool starspots. Decade-long photometry has shown that the spots seem to change their longitudinal appearance with a period of about six years, coherent with brightness variations. Our aim is to spatially resolve the stellar surface of HD 208472 and relate the photometric results to the true longitudinal and latitudinal spot appearance. Furthermore, we investigate the surface differential rotation pattern of the star. We employed three years of high-resolution spectroscopic data with a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) from the STELLA robotic observatory and determined new and more precise stellar physical parameters. Precalculated synthetic spectra were fit to each of these spectra, and we provide new spot-corrected orbital elements. A sample of 34 absorption lines per spectrum was used to calculate mean line profiles with a S/N of several hundred. A total of 13 temperature Doppler images were reconstructed from these line profiles with the inversion code iMap. Differential rotation was investigated by cross-correlating successive Doppler images in each observing season. Spots on HD 208472 are distributed preferably at high latitudes and less frequently around mid-to-low latitudes. No polar-cap like structure is seen at any epoch. We observed a <b>flip-flop</b> <b>event</b> between 2009 and 2010, manifested as a flip of the spot activity from phase 0. 0 to phase 0. 5, while the overall brightness of the star continued to increase and reached an all-time maximum in 2014. Cross-correlation of successive Doppler images suggests a solar-like differential rotation that is ~ 15 times weaker than that of the Sun. Comment: 12 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
40|$|FK Comae is {{a rapidly}} {{rotating}} magnetically active star, the light curve {{of which is}} modulated by cool spots on its surface. It was the first star where the "flip-flop" phenomenon was discovered. Since then, flip-flops in the spot activity {{have been reported in}} many other stars. Therefore, it is of interest to perform a more thorough study of the evolution of the spot activity in FK Com. In this study, we analyse 15 years of photometric observations with two different time series analysis methods, with a special emphasis on detecting <b>flip-flop</b> type <b>events</b> from the data. We apply the continuous period search and carrier fit methods on long-term standard Johnson-Cousins V-observations from the years 1995 [...] 2010. The observations were carried out with two automated photometric telescopes, Phoenix- 10 and Amadeus T 7 located in Arizona. We identify complex phase behaviour in 6 of the 15 analysed data segments. We identify five <b>flip-flop</b> <b>events</b> and two cases of phase jumps, where the phase shift is Δϕ 0. 031. The flip-flop cannot be interpreted as a single phenomenon, where the main activity jumps from one active longitude to another. In some of our cases the phase shifts can be explained by differential rotation: Two spot regions move with different angular velocity and even pass each other. Comparison between the methods show that the carrier fit utility is better in retrieving slow evolution especially from a low amplitude light curve, while the continuous period search is more sensitive in case of rapid changes.

40|$|According {{to earlier}} Doppler {{images of the}} magnetically active primary giant {{component}} of the RS CVn binary II Peg, {{the surface of the}} star was dominated by one single active longitude that was clearly drifting in the rotational frame of the binary system during 1994 - 2002; later imaging for 2004 - 2010, however, showed decreased and chaotic spot activity, with no signs of the drift pattern. Here we set out to investigate from a more extensive photometric dataset whether such a drift is a persistent phenomenon, in which case it could be due to either an azimuthal dynamo wave or an indication of the binary system orbital synchronization still being incomplete. We analyse the datasets using the Carrier Fit method (hereafter CF), especially suitable for analyzing time series in which a fast clocking frequency (such as the rotation of the star) is modulated with a slower process (such as the stellar activity cycle). We combine all collected photometric data into one single data set, and analyze it with the CF method. As a result, we confirm the earlier results of the spot activity having been dominated by one primary spotted region almost through the entire data set, and the existence of a persistent, nearly linear drift. Disruptions of the linear trend and complicated phase behavior are also seen, but the period analysis reveals a rather stable periodicity with P(spot) = 6. 71054 d plus/minus 0. 00005 d. After the linear trend is removed from the data, we identify several abrupt phase jumps, three of which are analyzed in more detail with the CF method. These phase jumps closely resemble what is called <b>flip-flop</b> <b>event,</b> but the new spot configurations do not, in most cases, persist for longer than a few months.

40|$|We {{present and}} analyze {{long-term}} optical photometric {{measurements of the}} three active stars V 2253 Oph, IT Com and IS Vir. All three systems are single-lined spectroscopic binaries with an early K giant as primary component but in different stages of orbital-rotational synchronization. Our photometry is supplemented by 2 MASS and WISE near-IR and mid-IR magnitudes and then used to obtain more accurate effective temperatures and extinctions. For V 2253 Oph and IT Com, we found their spectral energy distributions consistent with pure photospheric emission. For IS Vir, we detect a marginal mid-IR excess which hints towards a dust disk. The orbital and rotational planes of IT Com appear to be coplanar, contrary to previous findings in the literature. We apply a multiple frequency analysis technique to determine photometric periods, and possibly changes of periods, ranging from days to decades. New rotational periods of 21. 55 +- 0. 03 d, 65. 1 +- 0. 3 d, and 23. 50 +- 0. 04 d were determined for V 2253 Oph, IT Com, and IS Vir, respectively. Splitting of these periods led to tentative detections of differential surface rotations of delta P/P ~ 0. 02 for V 2253 Oph and 0. 07 for IT Com. Using a time-frequency technique based on short-term Fourier transforms we present evidence of cyclic light variations of length ~ 10 yrs for V 2253 Oph and 5 - 6 yrs for IS Vir. A single <b>flip-flop</b> <b>event</b> has been observed for IT Com of duration 2 - 3 yrs. Its exchange of the dominant active longitude had happened close to a time of periastron passage, suggesting some response of the magnetic activity from the orbital dynamics. The 21. 55 -d rotational modulation of V 2253 Oph showed phase coherence also with the orbital period, which is 15 times longer than the rotational period, thus also indicating a tidal feedback with the stellar magnetic activity.

40|$|In {{answer to}} the wide {{interest}} in membrane-sensitive probes to visualize the membrane potential in cellular microscopy, {{a new set of}} dyes was developed and characterized to study the influence of different polar heads to minimize flip-flopping in cellular second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. Theoretically, SHG microscopy is a more sensitive technique than fluorescence to visualize the fluctuations caused by changes in the membrane potential, using the appropriate membrane probes. This is due to the coherent and the second-order nature of the phenomenon. However, SHG is much more sensitive to centrosymmetry than are fluorescence methods. This centrosymmetry can be caused by <b>flip-flop</b> <b>events</b> of the dye inside the membrane. In case equal amounts of dye are distributed over the inner and outer leaflets of the membrane, the SHG signal will be canceled out. This may sound as a handicap, {{but it can also be}} used as an advantage, and it is often seen as a way to record complementary information in combined SHG and two-photon fluorescence (TPF) microscopy, possibly revealing information that cannot be probed by fluorescence alone. The combination is interesting because it allows for monitoring the presence of a fluorescent marker, while, at the same time, the SHG signal reveals more information on the ordering of the molecules. Because of the sensitivity for centrosymmetry, time-resolved SHG microscopy is ideal for the visualization of flip-flop dynamics of membrane-associated dyes. We studied this behavior for a number of recently designed and synthesized probes with identical chromphores but with different polar heads attached to minimize flip-flopping. In a first stage, toxicity of the dyes was determined, as well as the first hyperpolarizability in different relevant buffers or medium. Based on time-lapse recordings in the combined SHG and TPF microscope, we studied the effect of the different polar heads on flip-flop dynamics of the dye. The results were compared with di- 8 -ANEPPS at 810 nm. The new chromphore has its optimal performance in the wavelength range of about 950 - 1070 nm, which is red shifted compared with di- 8 -ANEPPS and several other currently available commercial dyes for SHG and in this aspect better for the experiment in terms of imaging depth and invasiveness or phototoxicity in the sample. The chromophore also exhibits a large Stokes' shift, making it suitable for use in microscopes that are not optimized for SHG microscopy, as a broad band pass filter is as effective as a narrow band pass filter for SHG only. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{universe}} is populated with magnetically active stars. This magnetic activity {{is thought to}} be generated by dynamos operating in turbulent stellar convection zones, a process by which kinetic energy is converted into magnetic energy. The solar dynamo is but one dynamo type possible for stars. Rapidly rotating late-type stars are observed to have large spots, activity cycles, flip-flops, and active longitudes, all indicating a different dynamo mechanism may be responsible. Numerical simulations provide a tool for better understanding some of the mechanisms responsible for these dynamos. In this thesis, direct numerical simulations in spherical wedges are used to study dynamo mechanisms in the stellar convection zone. These spherical wedges are used to investigate the dependence of the resulting magnetic field on input parameters such as the density stratification and rotation rate. Mean-field models are used to evaluate the assumption that the wedges can be used to approximate full spheres. As rotation increases, differential rotation decreases in the models, in agreement with observations where more rapidly rotating stars have smaller estimates for differential rotation. As density stratification approaches more realistic values, a lat- itudinal dynamo wave with equatorward propagation is found. The impact of the domain size in the azimuthal direction on the results is explored. When the domain size is increased to 2 pi in the azimuthal direction, a non-axisymmetric m = 1 mode is excited. This non-axisymmetry is reminiscent of the field configurations of rapidly rotating late-type stars. The azimuthal dynamo wave rotates nearly independently of latitude and depth, and its rotation rate is slower than that of the mean rotation of the model. This azimuthal dynamo can provide a possible explanation for the observed rotational difference of spots from the mean rotation observed on stars. The wedges use the perfect conductor boundary conditions at the latitudinal boundary to compensate for the omission of polar regions due to the time step becoming prohibitively small there. Simple mean-field models with only a latitudinal extent and perfectly conducting boundaries do not oscillate when the model is extended to the poles. Thus oscillations near the polar region may be an artifact of the boundary condition. However, when the alpha effect from mean-field dynamo theory and magnetic diffusivity are concentrated towards lower latitudes, oscillatory solutions with equatorward migration are found. When sufficient shear is added, oscillatory solutions are again found, and the Parker-Yoshimura rule for latitudinal dynamo wave propagation is obeyed. It is concluded that numerical simulations where the alpha effect and diffusivity are found to be stronger at lower latitudes and simulations with sufficient shear are considered good approximations of full spheres. These numerical simulations are put into context with stellar observations. Two young solar analogs are selected, V 352 Canis Majoris and LQ Hydrae.
