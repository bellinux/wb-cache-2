5|$|As Bryan spoke {{his final}} sentence, recalling the Crucifixion of Jesus, {{he placed his}} hands to his temples, fingers extended; with the final words, he <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> to his sides {{straight}} out to his body and held that pose for about five seconds as if offering himself as sacrifice for the cause, as the audience watched in dead silence. He then lowered them, descended from the podium, and began to head back to his seat as the stillness held.|$|E
500|$|As {{he spoke}} his final sentence, {{he brought his}} hands to his head, fingers {{extended}} in imitation of thorns; amid dead silence in the Coliseum, he <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> recalling with words and posture the Crucifixion of Jesus, and held that position for several seconds. [...] He then lowered his arms, and began the journey back to his seat in the silence.|$|E
60|$|For {{some time}} {{the young man}} gazed upon her as though entranced, but at length he slowly <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> as though to embrace the {{beautiful}} phantom. The domestic fell upon his face like one stricken by death, the spectre vanished, and again the pealing thunder broke forth.|$|E
60|$|Jacob <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> {{as far as}} {{possible}} around her ample waist.|$|R
50|$|In his {{appearances}} in Avengers Academy, it is shown {{that he is}} now able to telescopically <b>extend</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and legs.|$|R
5000|$|Tension - A Brood Mutant who can <b>extend</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> to constrict anyone. After attacking Reverend William Conover, Tension {{was killed}} by Havok.|$|R
6000|$|With {{a sudden}} and irresistible impulse Robin <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> towards her. She made a little run towards him, then stopped, and the look of fear again came over her {{beautiful}} face. Robin was afraid to advance lest he should frighten her. So, with an earnest look and smile, he said, [...] "Come here, little one." ...|$|E
60|$|As Barney turned {{both the}} men fired simultaneously, and both missed. The American raised his revolver, {{and with the}} flash of it the {{foremost}} brigand came to a sudden stop. An expression of bewilderment crossed his features. He <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> straight before him, the revolver slipped from his grasp, and then like a dying top he pivoted once drunkenly and collapsed upon the turf.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he looked}} about. Cowering {{on the floor}} against a wall was his wife, {{clasping}} his child. As he sprang toward her she rose and broke into laughter, long, loud, and mechanical, devoid of gladness and devoid of sense--the laughter that {{is not out of}} keeping with the clanking of a chain. Hardly knowing what he did he <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> She laid the babe in them. It was dead--pressed to death in its mother's embrace.|$|E
50|$|The {{player who}} <b>extends</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> under the center must receive the snap or the {{offensive}} {{team will be}} penalized for a false start.|$|R
60|$|CAMPBELL. Oh, aunty, did she forget you? [He runs back, and <b>extends</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> to <b>his</b> aunt.] Let me {{help you}} down, Aunt Mary.|$|R
25|$|Roughing-the-passer {{penalties}} {{will not}} be called on a defender engaged with a quarterback who simply <b>extends</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and shoves the passer to the ground.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no mistaking}} this attitude. Old Swallowtail was calling on God to support him in this hour of trial. Josie felt {{something}} clutching at her heart. Nothing could be more impressive than this scene--this silent but earnest appeal to the Most High by the man whom she suspected of murder--of crimes even more terrible. She could see his eyes, pleading and sincere, turned upward; could see his gray hair flutter in the breeze; could see his lips move, though they uttered no sound. And after he had poured out his heart to his Maker he <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> upon the slab, rested his head upon them and again became motionless.|$|E
60|$|Besides the hut {{in which}} they had spent the night, there were several other huts near the corral, and Lawrence now {{perceived}} that the place was a sort of hamlet, surrounded by a small ditch by way of defence. While our hero was glancing round him he observed that Quashy stopped suddenly, and gazed at something in front of him as if transfixed with a surprise which threw quite into the shade all his previous expressions of astonishment, and convinced his master that he had not yet fathomed half the depth of meaning that could be thrown into that sable countenance. Quashy bent slightly forward, <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> spread out his ten fingers, opened his mouth, and tried to speak.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hark! {{the trumpet}} blows for the sacrifice!' {{interrupted}} the raving {{voice of the}} Pagan, as he turned from the altar, and <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> in frenzied inspiration. 'The roar of music {{and the voice of}} exultation soar upward from the highest mountain-tops! The incense smokes, and in and out, and round and round, the dancers whirl about the pillars of the temple! The ox for the sacrifice is without spot; his horns are gilt; the crown and fillet adorn his head. The priest stands before him naked from the waist upwards; he heaves the libation out of the cup; the blood flows over the altar! Up! up! tear forth with reeking hands the heart while it is yet warm, futurity is before you in the quivering entrails, look on them and read! read!' ...|$|E
6000|$|STEPHEN: (<b>Extends</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms)</b> It was here. Street of harlots. In Serpentine avenue Beelzebub {{showed me}} her, a fubsy widow. Where's {{the red carpet}} spread? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] {{shouted the}} curate, {{at the top}} of his voice, {{standing}} likewise and <b>extending</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> [...] "Speak! The word of the Lord is upon me!" ...|$|R
50|$|Pushing the {{opponent}} {{out of the}} ring without holding their mawashi or belt, nor fully <b>extending</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> Hand contact must be maintained through the push (front push out).|$|R
60|$|Moonlight was Indian {{enough to}} know that females might not dare to {{interrupt}} the solemn council. She was also white woman enough to scorn the humble gait and ways of her red kindred, and to run eagerly to meet her sire {{as if she had been}} an out-and-out white girl. The hunter, as we have said, rather prided himself in keeping up some of the ways of his own race. Among other things, he treated his wife and daughter after the manner of white men--that is, well-behaved white men. When Moonlight saw him coming towards his wigwam, she bounded towards him. Little Tim <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> caught her round the slender waist with his big strong hands, and lifted her as if she had been a child until her face was opposite his own.|$|E
60|$|As the {{superficial}} fervency of youth decayed, this peculiar effect of Gervayse Hastings's character grew more perceptible. His children, when he <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> came coldly to his knees, but never climbed {{them of their}} own accord. His wife wept secretly, and almost adjudged herself a criminal because she shivered in the chill of his bosom. He, too, occasionally appeared not unconscious of the chillness of his moral atmosphere, and willing, if it might be so, to warm himself at a kindly fire. But age stole onward and benumbed him snore and more. As the hoar-frost began to gather on him his wife went to her grave, and was doubtless warmer there; his children either died or were scattered to different homes of their own; and old Gervayse Hastings, unscathed by grief,--alone, but needing no companionship,--continued his steady walk through life, and still one very Christmas day attended at the dismal banquet. His privilege as a guest had become prescriptive now. Had he claimed {{the head of the}} table, even the skeleton would have been ejected from its seat.|$|E
60|$|She {{slightly}} {{moved the}} door. The {{interior of the}} brewhouse was wrapped in gloom, but a streak of light fell towards her in a line across the floor from the inner or workshop door, which was not quite closed. This light was unexpected, none having been visible through hole or crevice. Glancing in, the woman found that he had placed cloths and mats at the various apertures, and hung a sack at the window to prevent the egress of a single ray. She could also perceive from where she stood that the bar of light fell across the brewing-copper just outside the inner door, and that upon it lay the key of her bedroom. The illuminated interior of the workshop was also partly visible from her position through the two half-open doors. Manston was engaged in emptying a large cupboard of the tools, gallipots, and old iron it contained. When it was quite cleared he took a chisel, and with it began to withdraw the hooks and shoulder-nails holding the cupboard to the wall. All these being loosened, he <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> lifted the cupboard bodily from the brackets under it, and deposited {{it on the floor}} beside him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mon Feu-Follet!" [...] exclaimed Raoul, {{rising and}} {{actually}} <b>extending</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> {{as if to}} embrace the beloved craft. [...] "Etooelle, they seek us, for we are much behind our time!" ...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the four}} master automatons, he is the juggler of the circus. He {{wants to know what}} the word [...] "delicious" [...] means. He can <b>extend</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and <b>his</b> hat has a razor sharp brim.|$|R
60|$|Lying back in <b>his</b> seat, he <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> {{over the}} table and pushed the watch away slightly. Captain Mitchell walked up with undisguised eagerness, put it to his ear, then slipped it into his pocket coolly.|$|R
60|$|It {{was on the}} 10th of April, anno 1695, that I set my foot {{upon the}} island a second time. When my {{faithful}} Spaniard, accompanied by one more, approached the boat, he little knew who I was, till I discovered myself to him. Seignor, said I, in Portuguese, don't you know me? He spoke never a word, but giving his musket to his attendant, <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> and saying something in Spanish that I did not then understand, he came forward & embraced me, saying, he was inexcusable not to know his deliverer: who, like an angel sent from heaven, had saved his life; He then beckoned to the man to call out his companions, asking me if I would walk to my own habitation and take possession, where I should find some mean improvements; but indeed they were extraordinary ones: for they had planted so many trees so close together, that the place was like a labyrinth, which none could find out except themselves, who knew its intricate windings. I asked him the meaning of all these fortifications? {{he told me he}} would give a large account of what had passed since my departure till this time, and how he had subdued some English, who thought to be their murderers, hoping I would not be displeased, since necessity compelled them to it. As I knew they were wicked villains, so I told him, that I was not only far from finding fault with it, but was rather heartily glad that they had subdued them. While we were thus talking, the man whom he sent returned, accompanied by eleven more, but in such habits, {{that it was impossible to}} tell what nations they were of. He first turned to me, and pointing to them, These Sir, said he, are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to your goodness, then turning to them, and pointing to me, he made them sensible who I was; and, then indeed they saluted me one by one, not as ordinary men, but as tho' they had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a triumphant conqueror; for their behaviour not only agreed with a manlike, majestic gravity, but at the same time was so obliging and courteous, as made them agreeable to the last degree.|$|E
5000|$|He {{proceeded}} to [...] "prove" [...] just that. He placed three stools {{on a wooden}} bench. His youngest son Eugène stood on the middle one. With the instructions from his father, he <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> Robert-Houdin placed two canes {{on top of the}} stools and positioned them under his son's arms.|$|E
50|$|As {{he spoke}} his final sentence, {{he brought his}} hands to his head, fingers {{extended}} in imitation of thorns; amid dead silence in the Coliseum, he <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> recalling with words and posture the Crucifixion of Jesus, and held that position for several seconds. He then lowered his arms, and began the journey back to his seat in the silence.|$|E
60|$|ASHER (<b>extending</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> {{and putting}} <b>his</b> hands on GEORGE'S shoulders). Something's upset you today, my boy,--you don't know what you're saying. When {{you get over}} there and take command of your men you'll see things in a truer proportion.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} he {{advanced}} and <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> {{as with the}} purpose of laying hold upon her. But she shrunk back from his grasp, and uttered the scream which, as we before noticed, brought into the apartment Lambourne and Foster.|$|R
50|$|Gildar Brothers: Appears in episode 15. Powers include {{forming a}} tornado, flight, the silver one can <b>extend</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> the red one is {{armed with a}} scythe, the black one can fire a bladed boomerang from his abdomen, the {{combination}} to form Giant Gildar.|$|R
5000|$|In conclusion, The {{findings}} of Zias and Sekeles do not indicate a horizontal patibulum cross-beam {{was attached to}} the victim's crucifixion device. Jehohanan may have very well <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> upward on a crux simplex (simple upright stake). The evidence was so ambiguous concerning the arms that Zias and Sekeles had to rely on the data provided by Classical writings to support their reconstruction of the position of the arms: ...|$|E

5000|$|Merrill wore number 33 {{starting}} in 1980 when the AL adopted uniform numbers. He {{came into the}} AL in 1977, the year that the league made all new umpires on staff wear the inside chest protector, which had been standard in the NL for over 60 years. Umpires who were wearing the outside protector and on staff prior to 1977 were grandfathered. Merrill {{had one of the}} largest strike zones in baseball, and was easily recognizable when calling balls and strikes, as he crouched directly behind the catcher and often <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> far in front of him. Most home plate umpires work in the [...] "slot", which is to the inside shoulder of the catcher (the left shoulder for a right-handed batter and the right shoulder for a left-handed batter).|$|E
60|$|I {{gave him}} three francs. He {{looked at it}} as if it were my death-warrant. He peered at the paper in the light of the lamp. Then he <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> with a gesture of superb insolence, flinging me back my gold without a word.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is here," [...] said Griffith, {{stepping}} aside, and <b>extending</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> {{towards the}} man that stood behind him, wrapped to the chin in his coarse pea-jacket, and his face shadowed by the falling rims of a large hat, that had seen much and hard service.|$|R
50|$|As he {{lies on the}} {{pavement}} with his blood streaming across the ground, the dark figure approaches Min and stands mere inches away, as if mocking his inability to capture him. Min <b>extends</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> desperately trying to grab him, but in vain and he soon loses consciousness...|$|R
