5|$|Sutherst {{said the}} scratch marks {{appeared}} in photographs taken on 10 September 1985, 34 {{days after the}} murders, but were not visible in the original crime-scene photographs. He also said {{he had failed to}} find in the photographs any chipped paint on the carpet below the mantelpiece, where it might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle. He was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece. He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes. He concluded that the scratch marks on the mantel had been created after the day of the murders.|$|E
5|$|At {{least in}} part resentful of the French king's {{previous}} support of his Lancastrian opponents, and possibly {{in support of his}} brother-in-law Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, Edward went to parliament in October 1472 for funding a military campaign, and eventually landed in Calais on 4 July 1475. Richard's was the largest private contingent of his army. Although well known to have publicly been against the eventual treaty signed with Louis XI at Picquigny (and absent from the negotiations, in which one of his rank would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> take a leading role), he acted as Edward's witness when the king instructed his delegates to the French court, and received 'some very fine presents' from Louis on a visit to the French king at Amiens. In refusing other gifts, which included 'pensions' in the guise of 'tribute', he was joined only by Cardinal Bourchier. He supposedly disapproved of Edward's policy of personally benefitting—politically and financially—from a campaign paid for out of a parliamentary grant, and hence out of public funds. Any military prowess was therefore not to be revealed further until the last years of Edward's reign.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write to relatives back home and encourage them to travel on White Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E

25|$|In all matches played {{under the}} Laws of cricket with no {{augmented}} playing conditions, the bowler may, {{after he has}} started his run up, but before he would normally <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> release the ball, attempt to run out a non-striker who has strayed outside his crease, with no warning mentioned. If the fielding side appeal the umpire will give the batsman out run out Under Law 41.16. The previous Laws were more restrictive as to when a bowler could attempt this, but they still allowed an attempt up until a bowler entered his delivery stride, which differed from the international game.|$|E
25|$|A fast {{battleship}} was {{distinguished from}} a battlecruiser {{in that it}} would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> be able to engage hostile battleships in sustained combat on at least equal terms. The requirement to deliver increased speed without compromising fighting ability or protection was the principal challenge of fast battleship design. While increasing length-to-beam ratio was the most direct method of attaining a higher speed, this meant a bigger ship that was considerably more costly and/or could exceed the naval treaty tonnage limits (where these applied– such as the Washington Naval Treaty shaping naval fleet composition before World War II). Technological advancements such as propulsion improvements and light, high-strength armor plating were {{required in order to}} make fast battleships feasible.|$|E

25|$|After this {{promising}} start, Coen might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> have {{a substantial}} Test career. Instead, in 1928–29 he lost form and made only 64 runs in six innings, which meant he was not picked for the 1929 South African tour to England. He did not play at all in 1929–30 and then in 1930–31 he started playing for Western Province; initially, he had little success, {{and he was not}} picked for the next South African Test tour, the 1931–32 tour to Australia and New Zealand. Ironically, while the tour was taking place, Coen had a second season in which he excelled with the bat, making 630 runs at an average of 63. Among his innings in this season was one of 173, his highest, against Transvaal.|$|E
25|$|While Senator Pete Domenici had {{declared}} that he would seek re-election in New Mexico, {{he changed his mind}} and announced on October 4, 2007 that he was retiring {{at the end of his}} current term due to a degenerative brain disorder. Domenici normally would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> win re-election easily, having won his current term with the support of two out of three New Mexico voters; however, he is to be investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee for his role in firing U.S. Attorney David Iglesias. Domenici's role in the developing scandal had reduced the probability he would have been re-elected, and a SurveyUSA poll showed his approval ratings at 41%, with 54% disapproving. The potential scandal may have also contributed to his decision to leave the Senate.|$|E
25|$|A US Census in 2006 {{reported}} that the population of New Hampshire was 1,314,895. 356,897 did not declare a party affiliation. These independent voters make up 44 percent of the New Hampshire electorate and could have voted in either the Democratic primary or the Republican Party's primary, but couldn't have voted in both. Democratic voters made up a smaller proportion. 216,005 people have registered as a Democrat. These statistics are important because in 2004, the New Hampshire independents leaned towards the Democratic side in favor of then-candidate John Kerry. Since then, New Hampshire has become more Democratic, replacing their Republican governor and state legislature with a government led by Democratic politicians. However, the people of New Hampshire are divided into several smaller regions, so the entire state as a whole wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> act in a uniform manner.|$|E
