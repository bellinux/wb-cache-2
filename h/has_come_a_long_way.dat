Tamagnino, likely based on his lauded works at the Certosa di Pavia, receives a commission for six different Caesars and other sculptures. But in an art scene increasingly monopolised by Cairano, who <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> from his naive expression of the Apostles, Tamagnino does not garner much attention, and, humiliated by the cold reception, he leaves Brescia, probably never to return.|$|E

He passed on the business to his son, Ranchod Lal, who ran a one-man operation. Eventually, Ranchod Lal's sons, Ramchandra and Lakshman, inherited the business and they were instrumental in giving a new direction to the company. The duo imparted a new vision to the venture and infused a spirit of calculated risk-taking into the firm. As a result, by the 1970s, the Vadilal Company had already evolved into a modern corporate entity.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} base for special effects was Century 21 Studios in Slough, Berkshire, {{which had been}} prepared for filming on the last Supermarionation series, The Secret Service. Supervising director Derek Meddings oversaw the shooting of more than 200 effects shots, including the destruction of EUROSEC Headquarters {{at the end of}} the film. A six-foot (1.8m) Phoenix scale model, which emulated the design of the NASA multi-stage Saturn V rocket, had to be rebuilt after unexpectedly igniting and nearly injuring a technician. For authenticity, the effects staff mounted the shots of the Phoenix lift-off outdoors in a section of the Century 21 car park so as to film against a genuine sky backdrop. Archer and Hearn describe the sequence as [...] "one of the most spectacular" [...] of its kind produced by Century 21. Sylvia Anderson, who considers it indistinguishable from a Cape Kennedy launch, comments that she is [...] "still impressed by the magic of the effects.

[...] The {{development of}} nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> since then. [...] The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist are gaining increasing attention as drug candidates for multiple central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and nicotine addiction. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are receptors found in the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous systems and skeletal muscles. They are ligand-gated ion channels with binding sites for acetylcholine as well as other agonists. When agonists bind to a receptor it stabilizes the open state of the ion channel allowing influx of cations.|$|E

Hundreds of years later perceptions would be changed again with the Atlantic slave trade which left ideas of idealism for Caucasians and a negative idea of any other race. Caucasian nationalists also believed that all races originated from the 'white' race, [...] "Goldsmith maintained that all humans sprung from one common parent and attributed the variations in the human family to the influence of climate, culture, and custom". With this extreme racism of the time the black body was studied, displayed and scrutinized for any minor difference.

2500|$|His Theology in the Flesh: How Embodiment and Culture Shape the Way We Think about Truth, Morality, and God is {{the first}} book to apply the field of {{cognitive}} linguistics to theology. According to cognitive linguistics, the specific types of bodies humans have shape how we interact with and understand our world. We have concepts such as up/down and in/out because we have bodies that can experience these sorts of things. Embodied experience also gives rise much of our metaphorical thinking. For instance, {{we know what it}} is like to go on a journey in which we experience getting to a destination together and perhaps overcoming obstacles on the way. Many, but not all, languages use the experience physical journeys as the framework in which to understand the experience of love. We say, [...] "Our relationship <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> together" [...] and [...] "We have overcome many bumps in the road." [...] We reason about our love relationship in terms of a journey. Yet, in English, we also conceive of love in terms of strong physical forces ("He's blown away by love"), magnetism ("She is attracted to him"), and even insanity ("He is crazy about her"). That means that metaphors can be cognitive and not merely rhetorical. We actually think with metaphors.|$|E
