"We shall all {{leave for}} Paris to-morrow, {{as early as}} possible," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> finally takes leave of the General and the pr√©fet, [...] "and take the money with us, of course. If the King--which God forbid!--is obliged to leave Paris, it will be most {{acceptable}} to him, until {{the day when the}} allies are once more in the field and ready to crush, irretrievably this time, this Corsican scourge of Europe." ...|$|E
6000|$|Is <b>he</b> <b>saying,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> grimly laughs, {{and strikes}} his thirty-fives and forties: [...] "Bah! I know you, Time, godlike and dread though you seem. What are you but a phantom--a dream--like {{the rest of}} us here? Ay, less, for you will pass away and be no more. Fear him not, immortal men. Time is but the shadow of the world upon the {{background}} of Eternity!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "So {{now they}} have {{let me come back}} to my Jock, and I see visibly his improvement. He holds out his hand, and he smiles, and he speaks now and then, the dreadful oppression is gone, and all the {{dangerous}} symptoms are abating, and I cannot tell how happy and thankful we are. 'Send my love, and tell Sydney she has a blessed Monk,' <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> wakes, and sees me writing.|$|E
6000|$|... "But what sudden {{noise is}} that he hears within the house? Why do those heavy steps press so rapidly against the stairs? What feet are they which are so busy in the room above him? He opens the sitting-room door, but he can see nothing. He has been left there without a candle. He peers up the stairs, but a faint glimmer of light shining through the keyhole of his wife's door is all that meets his eye. 'Oh, my aunt! my aunt!' <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> leans against the banisters. 'My aunt, my aunt, my aunt!' ...|$|E
60|$|The news is here of {{the capture}} by our forces of Grand Gulf--a large and very {{important}} thing. General Willich, an exchanged prisoner just from Richmond, has talked with me this morning. He was there when our cavalry cut the roads in that vicinity. He says {{there was not a}} sound pair of legs in Richmond, and that our men, had they known it, could have safely gone in and burned everything and brought in Jeff Davis. We captured and paroled 300 or 400 men. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> came to City Point there was an army three miles long (Longstreet's, he thought) moving toward Richmond.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mine moder," [...] was all <b>he</b> could <b>say,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> groaned heavily. In a {{few seconds}} he {{recovered}} with a start and bade {{the man in the}} bow paddle for his life.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] <b>he</b> would <b>say,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sat ponderously {{down with}} {{the air of a}} man opening an {{interesting}} conversation, [...] "I was just figuring it out that eleven months ago to-day I was in Pekin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} got to-day, Alf?" [...] <b>he</b> would <b>say,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> strolled over to the marquis. The name of the Chief was, I believe Alphonse, but [...] "Alf" [...] was near enough for Mr. Smith.|$|R
60|$|And, lastly, if <b>he</b> <b>says</b> (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> most {{certainly}} will) that these transformations only {{take place in}} the lower animals, and not in the higher, say that that seems to little boys, and to some grown people, a very strange fancy. For if the changes of the lower animals are so wonderful, and so difficult to discover, why should not there be changes in the higher animals far more wonderful, and far more difficult to discover? And may not man, the crown and flower of all things, undergo some change as much more wonderful than all the rest, as the Great Exhibition is more wonderful than a rabbit-burrow? Let him answer that. And if <b>he</b> <b>says</b> (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> will) that not having seen such a change in his experience, he is not bound to believe it, ask him respectfully, where his microscope has been? Does not each of us, in coming into this world, go through a transformation just as wonderful as that of a sea-egg, or a butterfly? and do not reason and analogy, as well as Scripture, tell us that that transformation is not the last? and that, though what we shall be, we know not, yet we are here but as the crawling caterpillar, and shall be hereafter as the perfect fly. The old Greeks, heathens as they were, saw as much as that two thousand years ago; and I care very little for Cousin Cramchild, if he sees even less than they. And so forth, and so forth, till he is quite cross. And then tell him that if there are no water-babies, at least there ought to be; and that, at least, he cannot answer.|$|E
6000|$|... "However, he's a good-natured old gentleman," [...] said John, [...] "and pays as a gentleman, and I {{think his}} word {{is to be}} relied upon, like a gentleman's. I had quite a long talk with him this morning: he can hear me better already, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> gets more used to my voice. He told {{me a great deal}} about himself, and I told him a good deal about myself, and a rare lot of {{questions}} he asked me. I gave him information about my having two beats, you know, in my business; one day to the right from our house and back again; another day to the left from our house and back again (for he's a stranger, and don't know the names of places about here); and he seemed quite pleased. 'Why, then I shall be returning home to-night your way,' he says, 'when I thought you'd be coming in an exactly opposite direction. That's capital! I may trouble you for another lift, perhaps, but I'll engage not to fall so sound asleep again.' He was sound asleep, sure-ly!--Dot! what are you thinking of?" ...|$|E
60|$|How {{many people}} in all, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, {{and one or two}} {{intimate}} friends of the family, dine together to-day at the eldest son's to congratulate the old couple, and wish them many happy returns, is a calculation beyond our powers; but this we know, that the old couple no sooner present themselves, very sprucely and carefully attired, than there is a violent shouting and rushing forward of the younger branches with all manner of presents, such as pocket-books, pencil-cases, pen-wipers, watch- papers, pin-cushions, sleeve-buckles, worked-slippers, watch- guards, and even a nutmeg-grater: the latter article being presented by a very chubby and very little boy, who exhibits it in great triumph as an extraordinary variety. The old couple's emotion at these tokens of remembrance occasions quite a pathetic scene, of which the chief ingredients are a vast quantity of kissing and hugging, and repeated wipings of small eyes and noses with small square pocket-handkerchiefs, which don't come at all easily out of small pockets. Even the peevish bachelor is moved, and <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> presents the old gentleman with a queer sort of antique ring from his own finger, that he'll be de'ed if he doesn't think he looks younger than he did ten years ago.|$|E
6000|$|... "My young master," [...] <b>he</b> was <b>saying,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{glanced at}} the letter he still held in his hand, [...] "tells me that any {{questions}} you may ask I may answer as freely as I am permitted to." ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{from that}} day on he made but the one {{reference}} to the ship's condition; and that was whenever Tommy drew upon his cellar. [...] "Here's to the junk trade!" [...] <b>he</b> would <b>say,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> held out his can of sherry.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{as regards}} this swelling," [...] <b>he</b> was <b>saying,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> began a belated and distant {{examination}} of Kwaque's affliction, [...] "I should say, at a glance, {{that it is}} neither tumour nor cancer, nor is it even a boil. I should say [...] " ...|$|R
6000|$|After dinner I {{watch him}} as he washes dishes: he hangs up a whole row of tin; the ship gives a lurch, and knocks them all down. He {{looks as if it}} was just what he expected. [...] "Such is life!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> pursues a frisky tin pan in one direction, and arrests the gambols of the ladle in another; while the wicked sea, meanwhile, with another lurch, is {{upsetting}} all his dishwater. I can see how these daily trials, this performing of most delicate and complicated gastronomic operations in the midst of such unsteady, unsettled circumstances, have gradually given this poor soul a despair of living, and brought him into this state of philosophic melancholy. Just as Xantippe made a sage of Socrates, this whisky, frisky, stormy ship life has made a sage of our cook. Meanwhile, not to do him injustice, let it be recorded, that in all dishes which require grave conviction and steady perseverance, rather than hope and inspiration, he is eminently successful. Our table excels in viands of a reflective and solemn character; mighty rounds of beef, vast saddles of mutton, and the whole tribe of meats in general, come on in a superior style. English plum pudding, a weighty and serious performance, is exhibited in first-rate order. The jellies want lightness,--but that is to be expected.|$|E
6000|$|He argues the {{question}} as to his house very well, as he did all questions. He tells the priests that the whole joy of his restoration must depend on their decision. Citizens who had hitherto been made subject to such penalties had been malefactors; whereas, it was acknowledged of him that he had been a benefactor to the city. Clodius had set up on the spot, not a statue of Liberty, but, as was well known to all men, the figure of a Greek prostitute. The priests had not been consulted. The people had not ratified the proposed consecration. Of the necessity of such authority he gives various examples. [...] "And this has been done," [...] he says, [...] "by an impure and impious enemy of all religions--by this man among women, and woman among men--who has gone through the ceremony so hurriedly, so violently, that his mind and his tongue and his voice have been equally inconsistent with each other." [...] "My fortune," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> ends his speech, [...] "all moderate as it is, will suffice for me. The memory of my name will be a patrimony sufficient for my children;" [...] but if his house be so taken from him, so stolen, so falsely dedicated to religion, he cannot live without disgrace. Of course he got back his house; and with his house about ¬£16,000 for its re-erection, and ¬£4000 for the damage done to the Tusculan villa with ¬£2000 for the Formian villa. With these sums he was not contented; and indeed they could hardly have represented fairly the immense injury done to him.|$|E
6000|$|Such a {{declaration}} would {{in some measure}} suit persons who had acted much otherwise than Mr. Hastings. When a man pleads ignorance in justification of his conduct, {{it ought to be}} an humble, modest, unpresuming ignorance, an ignorance which may have made him lax and timid in the exercise of his duty; but an assuming, rash, presumptuous, confident, daring, desperate, and disobedient ignorance heightens every crime that it accompanies. Mr. Hastings, if through ignorance he left some of the Company's orders unexecuted, because he did not understand them, might well say, [...] "I was an ignorant man, and these things were above my capacity." [...] But when he understands them, and when he declares he will not obey them, positively and dogmatically,--when <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> has said, and we shall prove it, that he never succeeds better than when he acts in an utter defiance of those orders, and sets at nought the laws of his country,--I believe this will not be thought the language of an ignorant man. But I beg your Lordships' pardon: it is the language of an ignorant man; for no man who was not full of a bold, determined, profligate ignorance could ever think of such a system of defence. He quitted Westminster School almost a boy. We have reason to regret that he did not finish his education in that noble seminary, which has given so many luminaries to the Church and ornaments to the State. Greatly it is to be lamented that he did not go to those Universities where arbitrary power will I hope never be heard of, but the true principles of religion, of liberty, and law will ever be inculcated, instead of studying in the school of Cossim Ali Kh√¢n.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oi be aveared, by what t' constable told me, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> won't be able vor {{to prove}} it. It seems <b>as</b> how <b>he</b> didn't get to Painton till t' morning. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> how <b>he</b> were awalking aboot on t' moor all night. So you see {{he will have}} hard work vor to clear hisself." ...|$|R
5000|$|Wimberley {{has said}} that he sees rocks, trees, and other {{physical}} objects <b>as</b> alive. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> that <b>as</b> <b>he</b> began to spend more time making photographs in the landscape, he ‚Äúcame to feel that everything around me had life in it, including those things that we think of as dead.‚Äù ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‚ÄúThe wolf {{happened}} to be near by, at that time, upon the rocks that were around the glen; and, hearing all this noise, he came and peeped over. As soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> saw how the case stood, {{he thought it would}} be most prudent for him to walk away; which <b>he</b> did, <b>saying,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> went.|$|R
6000|$|Let me {{take one}} example which may mark out {{the outline of}} the contention. Open the nearest comic paper and let your eye rest lovingly upon a joke about a mother-in-law. Now, the joke, as {{presented}} for the populace, will probably be a simple joke; the old lady will be tall and stout, the hen-pecked husband will be small and cowering. But for all that, a mother-in-law is not a simple idea. She is a very subtle idea. The problem is not that she is big and arrogant; she is frequently little and quite extraordinarily nice. The problem of the mother-in-law is that she is like the twilight: half one thing and half another. Now, this twilight truth, this fine and even tender embarrassment, might be rendered, as it really is, by a poet, only here the poet would have to be some very penetrating and sincere novelist, like George Meredith, or Mr. H. G. Wells, whose [...] "Ann Veronica" [...] I have just been reading with delight. I would trust the fine poets and novelists because they follow the fairy clue given them in Comic Cuts. But suppose the Professor appears, and suppose <b>he</b> <b>says</b> (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> almost certainly will), [...] "A mother-in-law is merely a fellow-citizen. Considerations of sex should not interfere with comradeship. Regard for age should not influence the intellect. A mother-in-law is merely Another Mind. We should free ourselves from these tribal hierarchies and degrees." [...] Now, when the Professor says this (as he always does), I say to him, [...] "Sir, you are coarser than Comic Cuts. You are more vulgar and blundering than the most elephantine music-hall artiste. You are blinder and grosser than the mob. These vulgar knockabouts have, at least, got hold of a social shade and real mental distinction, though they can only express it clumsily. You are so clumsy that you cannot get hold of it at all. If you really cannot see that the bridegroom's mother and the bride have any reason for constraint or diffidence, then you are neither polite nor humane: you have no sympathy in you for the deep and doubtful hearts of human folk." [...] It is better even to put the difficulty as the vulgar put it than to be pertly unconscious of the difficulty altogether.|$|E
5000|$|In {{interviews}} John Shannon {{has expressed}} {{his belief that}} the Jack Liffey books are as much novels of redemption as they are mysteries. He could be speaking of his own character when <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> has of writer Kent Anderson, that: [...] "Our surrogate adventurers {{have to face the}} ugly and cruel every day, and every day they have to reinvent human decency, out of nothing." ...|$|E
5000|$|Goldman {{wrote the}} {{original}} novel while experiencing writer's block, when writing Boys and Girls Together (published in 1964). He {{was inspired by}} {{an article about the}} Boston Strangler which suggested there might be two stranglers operating, and Goldman wondered what would happen {{if that were the case}} and they got jealous of each other. (In the film adaptation, there is only one strangler; Goldman hated this change.) <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> walked to his office, [...] "the book simply jumped into my head. Start to finish. The whole thing... And I remember getting to my office and frantically scribbling down an enormous number of chapters." [...] Goldman was worried about never finishing Boys and Girls Together, so he gave himself two weeks to write the new novel.|$|E
6000|$|I took it, and {{he pressed}} mine very kindly--"You {{may as well}} sit down here," [...] <b>says</b> <b>he,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> kept hold of it; [...] "there is plenty of paper." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{was a great}} frequenter of the Globe and Devil taverns, {{where he}} used to amuse the company by his talent at story-telling and his powers of mimicry, giving capital imitations of Garrick, Foote, Coleman, Sterne, and other public {{characters}} of the day. He seldom happened to have money enough to pay his reckoning, but was always sure to find some ready purse among those who had been amused by his humors. Goldsmith, of course, was one of the readiest. It was through him that Glover was admitted to the Wednesday Club, of which his theatrical imitations became the delight. Glover, however, was a little anxious for the dignity of his patron, which appeared to him to suffer from the overfamiliarity of some {{of the members of the}} club. He was especially shocked by the free and easy tone in which Goldsmith was addressed by the pig butcher: [...] "Come, Noll," [...] would <b>he</b> <b>say,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> pledged him, [...] "here's my service to you, old boy." ...|$|R
6000|$|When Mr. Trent had {{finished}} the reading he put all the papers together, and tied them up in a bundle again with the red tape. Holding the bundle in his hand, <b>he</b> stood up, <b>saying</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did so: ...|$|R
50|$|With Sunder‚Äôs {{interest}} in art continuing, he joined BFA {{to pursue it}} seriously. ‚ÄúObjects like the lantern, issurayyi, rolu- rokali looked interesting to me,‚Äù <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> points out works that depict these objects. He also loves to paint extinct art forms and occupations like budaga, angalollu, gangireddulollu, kommollu, sodi chepetollu, budabudukalollu and others. ‚ÄúI grew up watching them in our village and now life is devoid of instances where one can see such art forms. In some of my works I have represented a sensitive and unnoticed relation and the intimacy which is created or automatically formed between animals and human beings, ‚Äúhe explains. In his painting 'the morning clock' the village woman is compared to morning clock who works out her daily activities like a cock or hen.|$|E
5000|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Douglas Wolfe from TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 5/5 {{and stated that}} [...] "The way they ended it seemed believable and sad, {{given the fact that}} this was Cote de Pablo's final episode with NCIS". Joyce Eng and Kate Stanhope from TV Guide named it the week's [...] "Most Underwhelming Exit", saying, [...] "On NCIS, Tony tracks down an MIA Ziva -- who's on a soul-searching trip to her native Israel -- based on a dream he had (yeah, we know) and tries in vain to convince her to return with him to D.C. Instead, they say goodbye on an airplane runway, where Ziva tells Tony, 'You are so loved,' and they finally kiss. 'Hardest 180 of my life,' <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> walks to board the plane. Um, that's it? Listen, we know Cote de Pablo's decision to leave the show was a surprise, but Tiva fans deserve a bit more than a few meaningful glances, a brief kiss and a handful of short Ziva scenes over two episodes." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jack was reintroduced {{specifically}} {{to signal the}} new direction the company was taking to refocus and regroup after the E. coli disaster. In the original spot that debuted in Fall 1994, Jack ("through the miracle of plastic surgery", <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> confidently strides into the office building) reclaims his rightful role as founder and CEO, and, apparently as revenge for being blown up in 1980, approaches the closed doors of the Jack in the Box boardroom (a fictionalized version, shown while the aforementioned minimalist theme music from the 1980s Jack in the Box commercials plays), activates a detonation device, and the boardroom explodes {{in a shower of}} smoke, wood, and paper. The spot ends with a close-up shot of a small white paper bag, presumably filled with Jack in the Box food, dropping forcefully onto a table; the bag is printed with the words [...] "Jack's Back" [...] in bold red print, then another bag drops down with the Jack in the Box logo from that period. Later ads feature the first bag showing the text of the food item or offer the commercial is promoting.|$|E
50|$|The Car Cleaner - would phone, {{but would}} be {{impossible}} to understand anything <b>he</b> (Wright) was <b>saying</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> would be cleaning his car. The noise of the vacuum would drown out the majority of the conversation, leaving only innuendo-based snippets.|$|R
