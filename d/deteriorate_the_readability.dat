40|$|Ordering {{information}} {{is a difficult}} but important task for applications generating naturallanguage texts such as multi-document summarization, question answering, and conceptto-text generation. In multi-document summarization, {{information is}} selected from a set of source documents. However, improper ordering of information in a summary can confuse the reader and <b>deteriorate</b> <b>the</b> <b>readability</b> of the summary. Therefore, {{it is vital to}} properly order the information in multi-document summarization. We present a bottom-up approach to arrange sentences extracted for multi-document summarization. To capture the association and order of two textual segments (e. g. sentences), we define four criteria: chronology, topical-closeness, precedence, and succession. These criteria are integrated into a criterion by a supervised learning approach. We repeatedly concatenate two textual segments into one segment based on the criterion, until we obtain the overall segment with all sentences arranged. We evaluate the sentence orderings produced by the proposed method and numerous baselines using subjective gradings as well as automatic evaluation measures. We introduce the average continuity, an automatic evaluation measure of sentence ordering in a summary, and investigate its appropriateness for this task.

Tax Court cases can be a valuable source for their research on relevant tax issues. Unfortunately, Daily et al.

If the prior finding holds true for the court cases that financial planners frequently refer to, <b>the</b> declining <b>readability</b> may hinder and/or prolong their tax research. Our study assesses <b>the</b> <b>readability</b> of Tax Court cases citing the Internal Revenue Code (I. R. C.) Sections that are particularly relevant to financial planners. These code sections include Retirement Savings Account (RSA) Sections and General Financial Planning (GFP) Sections.

40|$|Summary: Written patient {{education}} {{materials are}} an important part of ambulatory pediatric practices. We evaluated <b>the</b> <b>readability</b> of 33 representative pediatric education materials using three common formulas: Fog, Fry, and SMOG. The majority of pamphlets had readabilities of grade nine or above. The need to use multiple readability formulas was also demonstrated. Although <b>the</b> three <b>readability</b> formulas were highly correlated, they were significantly different from each other when using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) design. In almost half, <b>the</b> <b>readability</b> estimates differed by at least two grade levels. In addition, a large intrapamphlet variability for some pamphlets suggests a need to focus more attention on <b>the</b> <b>readability</b> of multiple sections within a pamphlet, not only on the overall or average readability.

Therefore, in 2009, the European Commission published readability guidelines to try to ensure that the information contained in the package leaflet is understood by patients. Objective: The main objective of this study was to calculate and compare <b>the</b> <b>readability</b> levels and length (number of words) of the package leaflets for biological medicines in 2007, 2010, and 2013. Methods: Thesampleofthisstudyincluded 36 biologicalmedicinepackageleafletsthatweredownloadedfromtheEuropean Medicines Agency website in three different years: 2007, 2010, and 2013. <b>The</b> <b>readability</b> of <b>the</b> selected package leaflets was obtained using <b>the</b> following <b>readability</b> formulas: SMOG grade, Flesch-Kincaid grade level, and Szigriszt's perspicuity index. The length (number of words) of the package leaflets was also measured. Afterwards, the relationship between these quantitative variables (three readability indexes and length) and categorical (or qualitative) variables were analyzed. The categorical variables were the year when the package leaflet was downloaded, the package leaflet section, type of medicine, year of authorization of biological medicine, and marketing authorization holder. Results: <b>The</b> <b>readability</b> values of all the package leaflets exceeded the sixth-grade reading level, which is the recommended value for health-related written materials. No statistically significant differences were found between the three years of study in <b>the</b> <b>readability</b> indexes, although differences were observed in the case of the length (P=. 002), which increased over the study period. When <b>the</b> relationship between <b>readability</b> indexes and length and the other variables was analyzed, statistically significant differences were found between package leaflet sections (P<. 001) and between the groups of medicine only with regard to the length over the three studied years (P=. 002 in 2007, P=. 007 in 2010, P=. 009 in 2013). Linear correlation was observed between <b>the</b> <b>readability</b> indexes (SMOG grade and Flesch-Kincaid grade level: r 2 =. 92; SMOG grade and Szigriszt's perspicuity index: r 2 =. 81; Flesch-Kincaid grade level and Szigriszt's perspicuity index: r 2 =. 95), but not between <b>the</b> <b>readability</b> indexes and <b>the</b> length (length and SMOG grade: r 2 =. 05; length and Flesch-Kincaid grade level: r 2 =. 03; length and Szigriszt's perspicuity index: r 2 =. 02). Conclusions: There was no improvement in <b>the</b> <b>readability</b> of <b>the</b> package leaflets studied between 2007 and 2013 despite the European Commission's 2009 guideline on <b>the</b> <b>readability</b> of package leaflets.
