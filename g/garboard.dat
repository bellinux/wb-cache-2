50|$|Cogs were a type {{of round}} ship, {{characterized}} by a flush-laid flat bottom at midships but gradually shifted to overlapped strakes near the posts. They had full lapstrake planking covering the sides, generally starting from the bilge strakes, and double-clenched iron nails for plank fastenings. The keel, or keelplank, was only slightly thicker than the adjacent <b>garboards</b> and had no rabbet. Both stem and stern posts were straight and rather long, and connected to the keelplank through intermediate pieces called hooks. The lower plank hoods terminated in rabbets in the hooks and posts, but upper hoods were nailed to the exterior faces of the posts. Caulking was generally tarred moss that was inserted into curved grooves, covered with wooden laths, and secured by metal staples called sintels. Finally, the cog-built structure could not be completed without a stern-mounted hanging central rudder, which was a unique northern development. Cogs used to have open hulls and could be rowed short distances. In the 13th century they received decks.|$|R
50|$|Roanoke was a four-masted barque {{built by}} Messrs. A. Sewall and Co. in 1892 on the Kennebec River at Bath, Maine, in the United States. With the {{exception}} of Great Republic, she was the largest wooden ship ever built in an American yard. Her gross register tonnage was 3,347, but on a draft of 27 feet (8.2 meters) she could stow away 2,000 additional tons. Her length was 311 feet (94.8 meters), her beam 49 feet (14.9 meters), and her depth 29 feet (8.8 meters). Her lower yards were 95 feet (29 meters) long, and her foremast truck was 180 feet (54.9 meters) from the deck. The keel was in two tiers of 16-inch (40.6- cm) white oak, her <b>garboards</b> were eight inches (20.3 cm) thick, and her ceiling in the lower hold was 14 inches (35.6 cm). Into her construction went 1,250,000 board feet of yellow pine, 14,000 cubic feet (396.4 cubic meters) of oak, 98,000 treenails, and 550 hackmatack knees.|$|R

40|$|Krajem šezdesetih godina 20. stoljeća na ulazu u ninsku luku pronađeni su dobro očuvani ostatci dviju srednjovjekovnih brodica. Na inicijativu voditelja istraživanja Zdenka Brusića i konzervatora Božidara Vilhara oba su plovna objekta izvađena iz mora, konzervirana i izložena u Muzeju ninske baštine, čime je projekt zadobio sustavni karakter te donedavno predstavljao jedini arheološki projekt usmjeren na sustavno istraživanje i obradu podmorskih nalaza. Unatoč stručnim i znanstvenim radovima u kojima su brodovi sumarno obrađeni, detaljna objava nalaza tek predstoji. Stoga je 2008. započeo rad na dopuni postojeće dokumentacije, a jedan od prvih koraka bio je određivanje vrsta drvene građe korištene za izradu brodskih konstrukcija. U radu se ukratko iznose rezultati dosadašnjih istraživanja i provedenih analiza, te upozorava na alarmantno loše stanje nalaza. Two boats (Nin 1 and Nin 2) were {{discovered}} in the 1960 s {{at the entrance to}} Nin harbor, fifteen km northwest of Zadar. In 1974 the boats were lifted from the sea bed, were preserved in PEG and presented to the public in the Museum of Nin Heritage. According to radiocarbon evidence the boats date to the eleventh/twelfth century. They were about 8 m long and were built in skeleton first technique. The frames and planks were fastened together with nails and treenails. Instead of a central keel they were provided with a keel plank and two parallel bilge keels, which run below the <b>garboards.</b> A wooden base for the mast step was also found. A sampling of the wooden elements to identify wood species was realized in 2008. Sixty-one samples were taken from various elements of the Nin 1 frames, futtocks, stem post, bilge keel, planks and central plank), and 91 samples were taken from Nin 2 (frames, planks, bilge keel and central plank). The majority of the components from both wrecks were made of Quercus petraea. In Nin 1, 43 of 61 samples were of Quercus petraea, and 12 samples were of Quercus cerris. One plank was made of Platanus orientalis, another of Ulmus campestris. Four analyzed components were identified as Abies alba and are probably modern insertions in the reconstruction. In Nin 2, 84 of 91 samples were made of Quercus petraea, 6 of Quercus cerris. One plank was identified as Ulmus campestris. The native distribution area of Quercus petraea and Quercus cerris coincide. Both oak species are very common in Croatia and the Balkans. Anatomical features indicate that both species of oak that were used as construction timber for the Nin boats grew in a region characterized by high mountains and very cold winters, resulting in trees which are better fit for shipbuilding because of their strength and lack of insect and fungal damage. While it is logical to assume that local boatyards building small boats would have exploited local timber sources, or whatever was locally available, it is possible that such timbers were depleted in this region, thus forcing the procurement of timber from mountainous areas...|$|R

60|$|For know, gentle reader, the staunchness of the Snark. She is forty-five {{feet long}} on the waterline. Her <b>garboard</b> strake is three inches thick; her {{planking}} two and one-half inches thick; her deck- planking two inches thick and in all her planking there are no butts. I know, for I ordered that planking especially from Puget Sound. Then the Snark has four water-tight compartments, {{which is to say}} that her length is broken by three water-tight bulkheads. Thus, no matter how large a leak the Snark may spring, Only one compartment can fill with water. The other three compartments will keep her afloat, anyway, and, besides, will enable us to mend the leak. There is another virtue in these bulkheads. The last compartment of all, in the very stern, contains six tanks that carry over one thousand gallons of gasolene. Now gasolene is a very dangerous article to carry in bulk on a small craft far out on the wide ocean. But when the six tanks that do not leak are themselves contained in a compartment hermetically sealed off from the rest of the boat, the danger will be seen to be very small indeed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Garboard</b> - The strake {{immediately}} {{adjacent to}} the keel in a traditional wooden boat.|$|E
50|$|The strake {{immediately}} {{adjacent to}} the keel {{is known as the}} <b>garboard</b> strake. There are two, one {{on each side of the}} keel.|$|E
5000|$|There are 16 tapered planks per side. The <b>garboard</b> planks {{are near}} {{vertical}} where they {{attach to the}} keel. The <b>garboard</b> planks are narrow and remain only slightly wider to take {{the turn of the}} bilge. The topside planks are progressively wider. Each oak plank is slightly tapered in cross section to allow it to overlap about 30mm the plank above and below in normal clinker (lapstrake) style. Iron rivets are about 180 mm apart where the planks lie straight and about 125 mm apart where the planks turn.|$|E
50|$|In an open boat or in {{a larger}} vessel, the hog is the {{structural}} member which lies immediately above the keel {{to which it is}} permanently and securely fastened so that the two form one member to which the lowest strakes (the <b>garboard</b> strakes) are fastened.|$|E
50|$|A wale is a thick plank of wood {{fastened}} {{to the side of}} a ship to provide protection from wear. The <b>garboard</b> is the wale next to the keel; the gunwale is the top such plank and covers the heads of the timbers between the main and fore drifts.|$|E
50|$|The hull, typically, {{consists}} of four strakes each side, the <b>garboard</b> strakes being wide giving a flat run to the transom whilst having a fairly sharp entry at the stem. There is a recessed rear deck level with side benches and a recessed foredeck. Some models have a small one or two-berth cabin.|$|E

50|$|The second {{method is}} clinker. It is {{traditional}} {{in the north}} and produced relatively light but strong boats. Normally, the boats are built from the <b>garboard</b> up so that the upper plank overlaps (aka hems) the lower on the outside. That overlap is known as the land and it is held together by copper rivets. In the twentieth century, the boat may have been built of plywood and the strakes glued together without clenched nails. Medieval boats {{are more likely to have}} been riveted with iron nails. To rivet the lands, the planks in the two adjoining strakes are pierced, a nail inserted from the outside and a rove or rove punched over the inside end of the nail. The latter is then cut off a little proud of the rove. The nail is then clenched over the rove.|$|E
50|$|Broadly, {{the parts}} of the ship visible above the {{waterline}} were constructed from East India teak, while American rock elm was used for the ship's bottom. The keel (16.5 x 15 in) had on either side a <b>garboard</b> strake (11 x 12 in) and then 6 in planking decreasing to 4.75 in at 1/5 the depth of the hold. Teak planking began at approximately the level of the bilge stringer. All the external timbers were secured by Muntz metal (brass) bolts to the internal iron frame and the hull covered by Muntz sheeting up to the 18 ft depth mark. The stem (15 x 15 in) and sternpost (16.5 x 15 in) were of teak while the rudder was of English oak. The keel was replaced in the 1920s with one constructed from 15 in pitch pine. The deck was made of 3.5 in thick teak while the 'tween deck was 3 in yellow pine. Her length was 212 ft with a draft of 21 ft and a deadweight of 921 tons.|$|E
5000|$|... adhesive, notably epoxy. Traditionally, lands {{were neither}} glued nor was {{anything}} used to bed them. The <b>garboard</b> was bedded onto the hog and keel, and {{the ends of}} the strakes onto the stem and apron using a mixture of white lead and grease. During the World Wars new techniques and materials were developed by the aircraft industry. By the mid-1950s, these were well infiltrated into the boatbuilding trade. New boats in classes of racing dinghy with clinker hulls were built as glued clinker boats. The basic construction was the same but ply planking was used and the lands were glued with no fastenings, except that the ends and garboards were still screwed to apron and hog. The need to prevent the splitting of the planks was removed by the use of ply so no timbers were used. Except for a light gunwale and wide rubbing strake, the longitudinals were omitted too. A short thwart rising and knees were glued to the planking. These boats were all decked and that is how adequate stiffness was achieved. So that the liquid glue could be laid onto the land before the next plank was assembled onto it, they were built upside down.|$|E
50|$|In {{building}} a simple pulling boat, the keel, hog, stem, apron, deadwoods, sternpost and perhaps transom are assembled and securely set up. In normal practice, {{this will be}} the same way up as they will be in use. From the hog, the <b>garboard,</b> bottom, bilge, topside and sheer strakes are planked up, held together along their lands by copper rivets. At the stem and, in a double-ended boat, the sternpost, geralds are formed. That is, in each case, the land of the lower strake is tapered to a feather edge {{at the end of the}} strake where it meets the stem or stern-post. This allows the end of the strake to be screwed to the apron with the outside of the planking mutually flush at that point and flush with the stem. This means that the boat's passage through the water will not tend to lift the ends of the planking away from the stem. Before the next plank is laid up, the face of the land on the lower strake is bevelled to suit the angle at which the next strake will lie in relation with it. This varies all along the land. Gripes are used to hold the new strake in position on the preceding one before the fastening is done.|$|E
50|$|The longship's narrow deep keel {{provided}} strength {{beneath the}} waterline. A typical size keel of a longer ship was 100 x 300 mm amidships, tapering in width at {{the bow and}} stern. Sometimes there was a false outer keel to take the wear while being dragged up a beach. These large timbers were shaped with both adze and broadaxe. At the bow the cut water was especially strong, as longboats sailed in ice strewn water in spring. Hulls up to 560 cm wide gave stability, making the longship less likely to tip when sailed. The greater beam provided more moment of leverage by placing the crew or any other mobile weight on the windward side. Oceangoing longships had higher topsides about a 1 m high to keep out water. Higher topsides were supported with knees with the long axis fastened {{to the top of}} the crossbeams. The hull was waterproofed with animal hair, wool, hemp or moss drenched in pine tar. The ships would be tarred in the autumn and then left in a boathouse over the winter to allow time for the tar to dry. To keep the sea out, wooden disks were put into the oar holes. These could be shut from the inside when the oars were not in use. A drain plug hole about 25 mm was drilled in the <b>garboard</b> plank on one side to allow rain water drainage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{uppermost}} continuous strake {{along the}} topsides {{is called the}} sheer strake. In old vessels, a rubbing strake was built in just below a carvel sheer strake. It was much less broad but thicker than other strakes so that it projected and took any rubbing against piers or other boats when the boat was in use. In clinker boats, the rubbing strake {{was applied to the}} outside of the sheer strake. The strakes adjacent to the <b>garboard</b> are referred to accordingly as the first broad and second broad. Each strake thereafter has its own special name such as bottom strakes, lowers, bilge strakes, topside strakes, and uppers. Many current pleasure craft reflect this history by providing the boat with a mechanically attached (and therefore replaceable) rub rail at the location formerly occupied by a rubbing strake, often doubling to cover the joint between a GRP hull and its innerliner.A stealer is a short strake employed to reduce the width of plank required where the girth of the hull increases or is necessary due to a tuck in the shape. It is commonly employed in carvel and iron/steel shipbuilding, but there are very few, possibly only one type of, clinker craft that use them."A stealer is a short strake employed to reduce the width of plank required where the girth of the hull increases or is necessary due to a tuck in the shape." [...] This statement represents a mis-understanding of what a [...] "stealer" [...] is tasked with accomplishing as a hull is lined-off. After determining the widths of strakes amidships (there are three categories), a quantity can be determined for all these strakes. This quantity is then divided into the height of the stem to determine the width of the average hood-end. This width must be twice the hood-ends thickness or it {{will not be able to}} carry its fasteners. If the hood-ends are not wide enough, the quantity is dropped by one until the resulting revised width is strong enough to carry its fasteners. Stealer is actually a misspelling of the word steeler, the plankers borrowed this word from their peers in the foundry, where forgers would strengthen a piece of metal by steeling a different metal to the original piece. This was analogous to strengthening the hood-end by making it wider, providing more wood mass around each hood-end. Wider meant fewer hood-ends. A device was needed to compensate for the drop in strakes that actually reached the stem. The device was a strake that was stooped short of the stem by burying its forward butt end into a notch chiseled into a through plank. This strake was called a steeler by the plankers and a drop plank by the liners who originated it by counting strakes during the lining off process.|$|E
5000|$|The Viking shipbuilders had no written {{diagrams}} or standard written design plan. The shipbuilder {{pictured the}} longship before its construction, {{based on previous}} builds, and the ship was then built from the keel up. The keel and stems were made first. The shape of the stem was based on segments of circles of varying sizes. The keel was an inverted T shape to accept the <b>garboard</b> planks. In the longships the keel {{was made up of}} several sections spliced together and fastened with treenails. The next step was building the strakes [...] - [...] the lines of planks joined endwise from stern to stern. Nearly all longships were clinker (also known as lapstrake) built, meaning that each hull plank overlapped the next. Each plank was hewn from an oak tree so that the finished plank was about 25 mm thick and tapered along each edge to a thickness of about 20 mm. The planks were radially hewn so that the grain is approximately at right angles {{to the surface of the}} plank. This provides maximum strength, an even bend and an even rate of expansion and contraction in water. This is called in modern terms quartersawn timber, and has the least natural shrinkage of any cut section of wood. The plank above the turn of the bilge, the meginhufr, was about 37 mm thick on very long ships, but narrower to take the strain of the crossbeams. This was also the area subject to collisions. The planks overlapped by about 25 mm-30 mm and were joined by iron rivets. Each overlap was stuffed with wool or animal hair or sometimes hemp soaked in pine tar to ensure water tightness. At midlength, where the planks are straight, the rivets are about 170 mm apart, but they were closer together as the planks sweep up to the curved bow and stern. There is considerable twist and bend in the end planks. This was achieved by use of both thinner (by 50%) and narrower planks. In more sophisticated builds, forward planks were cut from natural curved trees called reaction wood. Planks were installed unseasoned or wet. Partly worked stems and sterns have been located in bogs. It has been suggested that they were stored there over winter to stop the wood from drying and cracking. The moisture in wet planks allowed the builder to force the planks into a more acute bend, if need be; once dry it would stay in the forced position. At the bow and the stern builders were able to create hollow sections, or compound bends, at the waterline, making the entry point very fine. In less sophisticated ships short and nearly straight planks were used at the bow and stern. Where long timber was not available or the ship was very long, the planks were butt-joined, although overlapping scarf joints fixed with nails were also used.|$|E
40|$|Scotia, to England, several leaks {{became evident}} soon after sailing. She became {{separated}} from her charges during a gale and the high winds and heavy seas only made the leaks worse. By 5 th February 1783, there were eight feet {{of water in the}} hold and despite heaving overboard guns and heavy stores, little progress was made in reducing the water level. It was decided to make for the nearest land, which was judged to be the Azores. The frigate arrived off Faial on 10 th February, but contrary winds blew her out to sea again. By then all the crew, officers and men together were working the pumps and bailing to keep her afloat. On 12 th February, with the crew exhausted by constant employment at the pumps, she was run ashore on the island of São Jorge. The chance was taken to examine her when ashore and it was found that her keel and <b>garboard</b> strake were so badly worm-eaten, they hardly existed. For the next two weeks, stores and provisions – wine, brandy, tar, iron, copper and empty casks- were taken out of her before the wreck was burnt, and were stored in the house of José de Sousa Pedroso, before they were auctioned in 1786. On the 22 nd February, the Town Council of Calheta assembled in a hasty meeting. The officials had heard the rumour that the Captain of the stranded frigate wanted to set her ablaze and were afraid of the consequences because they had also heard that the ship had many barrels of gunpowder onboard.
