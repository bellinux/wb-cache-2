25|$|After the conference, the Allies {{marched into}} Paraguayan territory, {{reaching}} {{the defensive line}} of Curupayty. Trusting in their numerical superiority {{and the possibility of}} attacking the flank of the defensive line through the Paraguay River by using the Brazilian ships, the Allies made a frontal assault on the defensive line, supported by the <b>flank</b> <b>fire</b> of the battleships. However, the Paraguayans, commanded by Gen. José E. Díaz, stood strong in their positions and set up for a defensive battle, inflicting tremendous damage on the Allied troops: over 8,000 casualties against no more than 250 losses of the Paraguayans. The Battle of Curupayty resulted in an almost catastrophic defeat for the Allied forces, ending their offensive for ten months, until July 1867.|$|E
25|$|Wheaton's division, led by Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Oliver Edwards's brigade, {{captured}} a {{sector of the}} line next to Warner's brigade. Lieutenant Colonel Elisha Hunt Rhodes led his 2nd Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry Regiment on a flanking maneuver where he could the main Confederate line into a ditch for some protection. The Union soldiers quickly climbed up the exterior slope {{to the top of}} the earthworks before the Confederates could reload and fire, causing the Confederates to retreat. After, Colonel William Penrose's New Jersey brigade initially was held back by more determined Confederate pickets and gathered in the moat in front of the Confederate earthworks and stormed over the barrier to subdue the North Carolina defenders in their front. Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Joseph Hamblin's brigade had the longest distance to cross before reaching the Confederate line, held at that point by Brigadier General Edward L. Thomas's Georgia brigade. The attack was covered by sharpshooters led by Captain James T. Stuart from the 49th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, who were armed with Spencer repeating rifles. Without having to engage in hand-to-hand combat, Hamblin's brigade overcame the defenders, many of whom already were retreating from <b>flank</b> <b>fire</b> from adjacent Union soldiers. Wright left Hamblin's brigade to guard the captured line at its north end as he reorganized most of the remaining men of the corps to move south.|$|E
2500|$|At 4 p.m. {{the next}} day, Confederate Brigadier General Thomas J. Churchill's {{arriving}} infantry started {{the attack on}} the Union forces. Taylor thought he was sending them into the Union flank, but it was actually the center. Confederate cavalry also miscalculated positions and suffered heavily from <b>flank</b> <b>fire.</b> Churchill's men did succeed in collapsing this Union center position, but this also brought his men into the middle of a U-shaped position, with A. J. Smith's unused divisions forming the base of the [...] "U". Though part of the advanced Union right had also collapsed, the forces of Smith and Mower next launched a counterattack, and joined by neighboring regiments, they routed Taylor's men from the vicinity of Pleasant Hill. Some cannon were recaptured.|$|E
30|$|For HREC 3, {{view was}} {{obscured}} by {{a bench in}} the slope contour, but the flaming front appeared to progress upslope through the transect. A <b>flanking</b> <b>fire</b> burned through HREC 4 and therefore ROS was not recorded. Both transects in HREC 5 were burned by headfire conditions. However, fire behavior was influenced by wind blowing across the slope and may have increased ROS. For HREC 6, the first transect was successful at recording upslope ROS; all other transects within this plot were burned by <b>flanking</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|R
50|$|The main {{armament}} of {{the fort}} was placed on two west facing earth bastions with a central curtain providing more guns <b>firing</b> through embrasures. <b>Flanking</b> <b>fire</b> for ditch defence was provided for musketry only. Two bastionettes {{were placed on the}} far side of the wet ditch, one at each shoulder. Two more <b>flanking</b> galleries <b>fired</b> across the faces of the curtain and bastions.|$|R
50|$|The sector {{included}} ten blockhouses, {{designated by}} number, and two artillery casemates, Noonenwald (AC7B) and Biding Nord (AC 3B), which provided <b>flanking</b> <b>fire</b> along the blockhouse line with 75mm guns. The sub-sector 's positions were {{located on the}} south bank of the Nied.|$|R
2500|$|The {{waves of}} {{infantry}} were engaged by massed small-arms fire from II Battalion, Infantry Regiment Lehr and III Battalion, Reserve Infantry Regiment 122, which destroyed the attack formation, from which {{small groups of}} survivors continued the advance. The 114th Brigade reached the wood quickly behind the barrage and dug in at the first objective. Further west the battalion of the 113th Brigade lost the barrage but managed to reach the first objective, despite crossfire and shelling by British guns. Various German parties surrendered and despite the chaos, {{it appeared that the}} German defence of the wood had collapsed. The artillery schedule could not be changed at such short notice and the German defence had two hours to recover. The advance to the second objective at [...] was delayed and conditions in the wood made it difficult {{to keep up with the}} barrage; an attack on an area called Hammerhead was forced back by a German counter-attack. On the left <b>flank,</b> <b>fire</b> from Quadrangle Alley stopped the advance and contact with the rear was lost, amidst the tangle of undergrowth and fallen trees. The barrage was eventually brought back and two battalions of the 115th Brigade were sent forward as reinforcements.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the left}} <b>flank,</b> <b>fire</b> from Quadrangle Alley stopped the advance and {{contact with the}} rear was lost, amidst the tangle of {{undergrowth}} and fallen trees. The barrage was eventually brought back and two battalions of the 115th Brigade were sent forward as reinforcements. The Hammerhead fell after a Stokes mortar bombardment and a German battalion headquarters was captured around [...] after which the German defence began to collapse. More British reinforcements arrived and attacks by the 50th Brigade of the 17th Division on the left flank, helped capture Wood Support Trench. The advance resumed at [...] and after two hours, reached the northern fringe of the wood. Attempts to advance further were stopped by machine-gun fire and a defensive line [...] inside the wood was dug. A resumption of the attack in the evening was cancelled and a withdrawal further into the wood saved the infantry from a German bombardment {{along the edge of}} the wood. In the early hours of 11 July, the 115th Brigade relieved the attacking brigades and at [...] a position was consolidated [...] inside the wood but then abandoned due to German artillery-fire. The 38th Division was relieved by a brigade of the 12th Division by [...] on 12 July, which searched the wood and completed its occupation, the German defence having lost [...] "countless brave men"; the 38th Division had lost [...] The northern fringe was reoccupied and linked with the 7th Division on the right and the 1st Division on the left, under constant bombardment by shrapnel, lachrymatory, high explosive and gas shell, the 62nd Brigade losing [...] by 16 July.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is hot work," [...] Will Gale {{said to his}} captain, {{when the}} enemy's guns, on the heights on either side, began {{to play on the}} line of the 66th with their <b>flank</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
50|$|Brattice, {{from the}} French bretèche, {{originally}} referred to {{part of a}} castle. This was a small wooden structure, sometimes temporary, that projected out beyond {{the main part of}} a castle wall, so as to give <b>flanking</b> <b>fire</b> along that wall whilst still offering some degree of protection. See hoarding.|$|R
50|$|The battalions took {{no part in}} {{offensive}} operations, but on 15 November {{the machine}} gun section of the 2/2nd Londons (four old Vickers-Maxims and two even older Nordenfelt guns), together with rifle fire and bombs, provided <b>flanking</b> <b>fire</b> {{in support of a}} limited attack by 52nd (Lowland) Division.|$|R
60|$|The moat, widened and deepened, {{completely}} encircled {{three sides}} of the castle, running between {{the inner and outer}} walls, which were set at intervals with small projecting towers so pierced that a <b>flanking</b> <b>fire</b> from long bows, cross bows and javelins might be directed against a scaling party.|$|R
60|$|The ground being now cleared, the gunboats {{opened with}} Maxim and cannon upon {{the rear of}} the Dervishes. The camel corps coming up, each man {{dismounted}} and added his fire to the turmoil; and, finally, three of Wauchope's battalions arrived, and the Lincolns, doubling to the right, opened a terrible <b>flank</b> <b>fire.</b> The Dervishes broke and fled; not, as usual, sullenly and reluctantly, but at full speed, stooping low to escape the storm of bullets that pursued them.|$|E
60|$|Only for a {{few minutes}} longer did they {{continue}} the attack. The deadly <b>flank</b> <b>fire</b> proved too much for their courage, and soon they too were in full flight, carrying off with them their killed and wounded. A shout of triumph rose from the two parties of whites, and a scene of wild delight took place; the women, now that the excitement was over, cried and laughed alternately in hysterical joy; the children shouted, while the men grasped each other's hands in fervent congratulation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I say," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "if {{you are looking}} for art-magic, what say you to their marching through the <b>flank</b> <b>fire</b> of our galleys, with eleven pieces of ordnance, and two hundred shot playing on them, {{as if it had been}} a {{mosquito}} swarm? Some said my men fired too high: but that was the English rascals' doing, for they got down on the tide beach. But, senor commandant, though Satan may have taught them that trick, was it he that taught them to carry pikes a foot longer than yours?" ...|$|E
50|$|Private First Class Carpellotti {{was killed}} in action at Tulagi, Solomon Islands. During the Battle of Tulagi, part of the initial {{landings}} of Guadalcanal campaign, he led a detachment to deliver a <b>flanking</b> <b>fire</b> on a Japanese position, enabling {{the rest of his}} squad to assault and capture the position.|$|R
50|$|Only a few {{shots were}} {{expected}} to be fired from any firing position. Strong reconnaissance elements were provided so that TDs would be able to use pre-arranged firing positions to best advantage. <b>Flanking</b> <b>fire</b> by TDs was emphasized, both to penetrate thinner enemy side armor, and to reduce the likelihood of accurate enemy return fire.|$|R
50|$|The spur {{on which}} the castle stands is cut by a large ditch sunk in the rock. A barbican was built beyond the ditch. It was linked by two drawbridges {{to the body of}} the castle. It was also defended by several guard towers, {{allowing}} a <b>flanking</b> <b>fire</b> from which the arquebuses could cover every angle.|$|R
60|$|From above {{they were}} {{protected}} from the fire of the Indians upon the bluff by {{the height of the}} bowlder at the foot of which they lay, while another just in front hid them from possible marksmen across the canyon. Smaller rocks scattered about gave promise of shelter from <b>flank</b> <b>fire,</b> {{and as soon as he}} had deposited Eddie in the comparative safety of their retreat Byrne commenced forming a low breastwork upon the side facing the village--the direction from which they might naturally expect attack. This done he turned his attention to the opening upon the opposite side and soon had a similar defense constructed there, then he turned his attention to Eddie, though keeping a watchful eye upon both approaches to their stronghold.|$|E
60|$|The {{weather was}} so atrocious that the veld resembled an inland sea, with the kopjes as islands {{rising out of}} it. By {{this stage of the}} war the troops were {{hardened}} to all weathers, and they pushed swiftly on to the scene of action. As they approached the spot where the Boers had been reported, the line had been extended over many miles, with the result that it had become very attenuated and dangerously weak in the centre. At this point Colonel Damant and his small staff were alone with the two guns and the maxim, save for a handful of Imperial Yeomanry (91st), who acted as escort to the guns. Across the face of this small force there rode a body of men in khaki uniforms, keeping British formation, and actually firing bogus volleys {{from time to time in}} the direction of some distant Boers. Damant and his staff seem to have taken it for granted that these were Rimington's men, and the clever ruse succeeded to perfection. Nearer and nearer came the strangers, and suddenly throwing off all disguise, they made a dash for the guns. Four rounds of case failed to stop them, and in a few minutes they were over the kopje on which the guns stood and had ridden among the gunners, supported in their attack by a <b>flank</b> <b>fire</b> from a number of dismounted riflemen.|$|E
60|$|Passing {{from the}} misadventure of the 5th Brigade we come {{as we move}} {{from left to right}} upon the 4th, or Lyttelton's Brigade, which was {{instructed}} not to attack itself but to support the attack on either side of it. With the help of the naval guns it did what it could to extricate and cover the retreat of the Irishmen, but it could play no very important part in the action, and its losses were insignificant. On its right in turn Hildyard's English Brigade had developed its attack upon Colenso and the bridge. The regiments under Hildyard's lead were the 2nd West Surrey, the 2nd Devons (whose first battalion was doing so well with the Ladysmith force), the East Surreys, and the West Yorkshires. The enemy had evidently anticipated the main attack on this position, and not only were the trenches upon the other side exceptionally strong, but their artillery converged upon the bridge, at least a dozen heavy pieces, besides a number of quick-firers, bearing upon it. The Devons and the Queens, in open order (an extended line of khaki dots, blending so admirably with the plain that they were hardly visible when they halted), led the attack, being supported by the East Surrey and the West Yorkshires. Advancing under a very heavy fire the brigade experienced much the same ordeal as their comrades of Hart's brigade, which was mitigated by the fact that from the first they preserved their open order in columns of half-companies extended to six paces, and that the river in front of them did not permit that right <b>flank</b> <b>fire</b> which was so fatal to the Irishmen. With a loss of some two hundred men the leading regiments succeeded in reaching Colenso, and the West Surrey, advancing by rushes of fifty yards at a time, had established itself in the station, but a catastrophe had occurred at an earlier hour to the artillery which was supporting it which rendered all further advance impossible. For the reason of this we must follow the fortunes of the next unit upon their right.|$|E
50|$|Wall towers, {{also known}} as mural towers, provide <b>flanking</b> <b>fire</b> (from {{crossbows}} or other projectile weapons) to a straight part of the curtain wall. Corner towers enfilade the two adjoining wall faces. If corner towers are far apart, additional flanking towers may be added between them. Towers in an outer curtain wall are often open at the back.|$|R
5000|$|The donjon {{is thought}} to {{have been one of the}} {{earliest}} experiments in improving <b>flanking</b> <b>fire</b> from the battlements (reduction of [...] "dead ground"), and a transitional form between the rectangular keeps of the 11th to 12th centuries, and widespread adoption of cylindrical keeps in the 13th century. Other contemporary examples can be seen at Étampes and Provins.|$|R
500|$|Hesse {{set about}} {{improving}} Gibraltar's defences {{to make it}} as difficult as possible for the enemy to mount a frontal attack. The town is set on the western side of a rocky peninsula connected to the Spanish mainland by a narrow sandy isthmus. The north side of the Rock of Gibraltar presents a vertical cliff; the only access to the town was via a narrow strip, only about [...] wide, which was blocked by the heavily fortified curtain wall known as the Muralla de San Bernardo (later the Grand Battery). The prince sought to reduce this strip even further by flooding it, forcing any attackers to use a narrow path between the Rock and the inundated area or to advance along the narrow shoreline. He set up cannon in five batteries along the north side of Gibraltar: on the Old Mole, to provide <b>flanking</b> <b>fire</b> from the west; on the Baluarte de San Pablo (later North Bastion) and on the Landport curtain walls, to provide direct fire onto the isthmus; on the Baluarte de San Pedro (later Hesse's Demi Bastion), to provide <b>flanking</b> <b>fire</b> from the east; and in a Round Tower, on a clifftop spur overlooking the isthmus (later the site of Forbes' Batteries), from where fire could be directed onto enemy troops {{on the far side of}} the inundated area. A [...] "bomb ship" [...] was also installed off the Old Mole, carrying a heavy mortar to provide additional <b>flanking</b> <b>fire</b> from the west.|$|R
60|$|But his two unhappy {{batteries}} {{were destined}} {{not to turn}} the tide of battle, as he had hoped, but rather to furnish the {{classic example of the}} helplessness of artillery against modern rifle fire. Not even Mercer's famous description of the effect of a <b>flank</b> <b>fire</b> upon his troop of horse artillery at Waterloo could do justice to the blizzard of lead which broke over the two doomed batteries. The teams fell in heaps, some dead, some mutilated, and mutilating others in their frantic struggles. One driver, crazed with horror, sprang on a leader, cut the traces and tore madly off the field. But a perfect discipline reigned among {{the vast majority of the}} gunners, and the words of command and the laying and working of the guns were all as methodical as at Okehampton. Not only was there a most deadly rifle fire, partly from the lines in front and partly from the village of Colenso upon their left flank, but the Boer automatic quick-firers found the range to a nicety, and the little shells were crackling and banging continually over the batteries. Already every gun had its litter of dead around it, but each was still fringed by its own group of furious officers and sweating desperate gunners. Poor Long was down, with a bullet through his arm and another through his liver. 'Abandon be damned! We don't abandon guns!' was his last cry as they dragged him into the shelter of a little donga hard by. Captain Goldie dropped dead. So did Lieutenant Schreiber. Colonel Hunt fell, shot in two places. Officers and men were falling fast. The guns could not be worked, and yet they could not be removed, for every effort to bring up teams from the shelter where the limbers lay ended in the death of the horses. The survivors took refuge from the murderous fire in that small hollow to which Long had been carried, a hundred yards or so from the line of bullet-splashed cannon. One gun on the right was still served by four men who refused to leave it. They seemed to bear charmed lives, these four, as they strained and wrestled with their beloved 15-pounder, amid the spurting sand and the blue wreaths of the bursting shells. Then one gasped and fell against the trail, and his comrade sank beside the wheel with his chin upon his breast. The third threw up his hands and pitched forward upon his face; while the survivor, a grim powder-stained figure, stood at attention looking death in the eyes until he too was struck down. A useless sacrifice, you may say; but while the men who saw them die can tell such a story round the camp fire the example of such deaths as these does more than clang of bugle or roll of drum to stir the warrior spirit of our race.|$|E
50|$|There {{was another}} machine gun in a <b>flank</b> <b>fire</b> {{position}} of the bunker that covered the entrance. It is not entirely clear which machine gun was used here. The weapon was fixed to a box stand (Untersetzkasten) with the corresponding gun mount. The <b>flank</b> <b>fire</b> position had a 7P7 armoured embrasure plate with a thickness of 10 centimetres and a weight of 7.5 tonnes, in front of which there was a stepped embrasure made of concrete. By means of a slide, the embrasure and observation slit could be close. In addition, for the viewing slit there was a sliding plate of armoured glass {{which could be used}} to observe the situation when under fire.|$|E
5000|$|With such entrenchments as these, having {{artillery}} throughout, with <b>flank</b> <b>fire</b> {{along the}} lines wherever practicable, and with the rifled musket then in use, which were effective at three hundred yards as the smooth-bore muskets at sixty yards, the strength of an army sustaining attack was more than quadrupled, provided they had force to man the entrenchments well. Maj. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys, {{chief of staff to}} General Meade ...|$|E
50|$|The brigade's {{greatest}} fight, however, was on July 3, {{where it}} was one of the principal defenders against Pickett's Charge. The Vermonters lost men to sharpshooter fire and to the bombardment preceding the Confederate attack. As the assault approached Cemetery Ridge, Stannard swung two of his regiments (the 13th and 16th Vermont) out at a 90° angle, pouring deadly <b>flanking</b> <b>fire</b> into Brig. Gen. James L. Kemper's brigade, one of the critical factors that defeated the Confederate attack. Minutes later, the unconnected assaults by the Confederate brigades of Brig. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox and Col. David Lang approached the Union line to the south of the Vermont Brigade. Stannard once again wheeled two regiments (the 14th and 16th Vermont) and repeated his tactic of <b>flanking</b> <b>fire</b> to repulse the assault. Stannard was wounded in his right thigh by an artillery shell fragment, but stayed on the field until the end of the battle. Col. Randall commanded the brigade until it was mustered out of service.|$|R
5|$|A {{peculiar}} {{feature of}} Muslim castles in the Iberian Peninsula {{was the use}} of detached towers, called Albarrana towers, around the perimeter as can be seen at the Alcazaba of Badajoz. Probably developed in the 12thcentury, the towers provided <b>flanking</b> <b>fire.</b> They were connected to the castle by removable wooden bridges, so if the towers were captured the rest of the castle was not accessible.|$|R
25|$|The {{upper section}} of Charles V Wall, {{somewhat}} further south, {{runs from the}} top of a cliff up to the crest of The Rock. It zigzags up the slope of The Rock in four stages in a configuration that lets the defenders give <b>flanking</b> <b>fire</b> to each face. The Hacho (later the Signal Station) {{at the top of the}} wall was once equipped with a small tower.|$|R
50|$|The bunker had a {{sophisticated}} array of communication facilities. Three underground cables of the fortress telephone network were terminated {{in a separate}} radio room, {{where there was a}} switchboard. Its inputs included slots into which field cable could also be connected either to provide additional cable connections or to bridge damaged underground cable. Telephones were installed in the most important room or at least connections for portable telephones were available. The turrets were connected independently of the central exchange in the radio to the associated battle preparation rooms with separate telephone lines. Voicepipes were used to link the inner entrance defence rooms and the <b>flank</b> <b>fire</b> position.|$|E
50|$|The Second Division ordered {{preparation}} for an advance beyond St. Étienne, {{but the time}} for this attack was not fixed. It {{was out of the}} question to push the salient any deeper; it was necessary to wait for the divisions on the flanks to come up. In the course of the morning, however, the 5th Marines continued the advance initiated the evening before, and succeeded in occupying the ridge a mile southeast of St. Étienne, suffering severely from <b>flank</b> <b>fire.</b> This somewhat relieved the pressure upon the 23rd Infantry, but brought the Marines into an even more precarious position. In the afternoon, the attack was continued, but such gains as were made could not be held.|$|E
50|$|The {{heaviest}} losses the 140th New York would incur in {{a single}} battle were incurred during severe fighting in The Battle of the Wilderness between May 5-7, 1864. 529 soldiers of the 140th New York led {{the opening of the}} battle with a charge across Saunders Field, and were among the first Union troops to engage the Confederacy in battle.The 140th took unsupported <b>flank</b> <b>fire</b> for over 30 minutes and sustained 255 total casualties. Estimates of exact losses are 50 enlisted men, and 3 officers killed in action or died of wounds sustained during battle.
