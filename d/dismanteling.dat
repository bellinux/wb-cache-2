40|$|This article studies Plagio de palabras by Elena Guiochins and Mme. Cuquita’s Show by Pilar Gallegos {{in a first}} {{approach}} to two creative women and their styles of discourse which {{do not belong to}} the hegemonic Mexican theatre scene. Violence, solitude, the fragmented "I," incommunication, <b>dismanteling</b> sexual stereotypes, uncertainty and the contingent game of past, present and future are themes presented in these two performances that depend on fracturing ideas and scenic space, combining minimalism with puppets and the presence of a confessional discourse that oscillates between irony and black humor.

40|$|The {{report of}} the Advisory Committee for the year ending June 30, 1927, is {{necessarily}} brief in content and transitional in character. Development {{work in the laboratory}} has been more or less interrupted throughout the year by the confusion of <b>dismanteling</b> the equipment at the Mount Wilson Observatory and removing it to the new Seismological Laboratory provided by the California Institute of Technology. The equipment of the various sub-stations about Pasadena and the adjustment of new apparatus therein has been going on throughout the year, but the continuous daily record of tremors is still tentative and inadequate {{because of the lack of}} a proper minute-to-minute time service through which to compare them. Progress in the San Francisco Bay region, which has been greatly stimulated through the personal efforts of Mr. Willis of this Committee, is also passing through similar transitional operations, and Mr. Willis is now absent on a journey around the world in the interest of general seismology. However, these activities are in themselves adequate evidence of progress even though we must wait for tangible results from them until the next and following years...|$|E

50|$|In {{front of}} a crowd that set the new record for highest decibel level at an NFL Game, the Chiefs <b>dismanteled</b> the Patriots 41-14 on Monday Night Football. The Patriots {{struggling}} offensive line combined with Bradys accuracy issues doomed them against Tamba Hali and Justin Houston while the Patriots had no answer for the Chiefs balanced offense, allowing over 200 yards rushing and receiving.|$|R
50|$|Trolleybuses are {{in use in}} Tallinn. The first {{trolleybus}} route {{opened on}} 6 July 1965. At its peak, the system had nine routes, currently the city of Tallinn is gradually substituting trolleybuses with hybrid drive buses. By 3 May 2017 only four lines remain in service, the overhead wires have been <b>dismanteled</b> on lines that have been closed. Some old Skoda 14Tr and 15Tr trolleybuses have been replaced with newer low-floor Solaris/Ganz T12 and T18 articulated models.|$|R
50|$|An {{ironworks}} {{was established}} {{on the site}} in 1911 as Norddeutschen Hütte - much of the works was destroyed or <b>dismanteled</b> during and immediately {{after the end of}} the Second World War. In 1957 steel group Klockner established a new steel works on the same site, Klockner Hutte Bremen. After growth during the 1960s and 1970s the business began to experience financial problems, and in 1the early 1990s Klockner became effectively bankrupt. In 1994 the steelworks at Bremen was acquired by Sidmar, renamed Stahlwerke Bremen; later becoming part of Usinor, Arcelor (2002), and ArcelorMittal (2006) through mergers of the parent holding company.|$|R
50|$|The Nesttun-Os Line (Nesttun-Osbanen) was {{a narrow}} gauge railway between Nesttun, {{now part of}} Bergen, and the {{community}} of Osøyro in Os municipality, Norway. As the first private railway in Norway, it opened 1 June 1894, designed to connect Os to the Voss Line, allowing for passenger and freight transport to Bergen and Voss. Despite a boom caused by World War I, the railway was eventually driven out of business by competition from road transport, which provided faster service. On 2 September 1935, it became the first Norwegian railway to close, {{and most of the}} railway was <b>dismanteled</b> the following year.|$|R
40|$|François Doumenge, Musée Océanographique de Monaco, Commission Internationale pour l'Exploration Scientifique de la Mer Méditerranée L'halieutique maldivienne, une ethno-culture millénaire As {{early as}} the 10 th century Arab navigators {{identified}} the Maldive Islands {{as a source of}} cowries as currency and coir as an indispensable material for the assembling of sewn hulls and rigs of fishing and commercial vessels. Later on, skipjack filets, once dried and smoked, provided the third specialty of these islands. The meeting of monsoon navigation networks brought the Maldive Archipelago in contact with the whole of Arab, Persian, Indian and Malay worlds. The shores of East Africa and South China could be reached from there too. The dynamics of the piscatorial ethno-culture, which flourished in a way of life entirely dominated by the sea, lay in the exclusive control of the barter system by the central power established in Male. In the cultural, political, and commercial sway of Salafi Sunnism, the Maldive Islands fully developed their potentialities, which flourished during the 15 th century, {{and they were able to}} resist the Portuguese intrusions of the following century. Stranded there in the early years of the 17 th century, Pyrard de Laval wrote an account of his stay and gave minute descriptions of lagoon and pelagic fishing techniques, related industries, and economic and commercial practices. This socio-economy, unique because of its coherence based on marine life, was <b>dismanteled</b> in the 19 th century by the force of colonial imperialisms (demonetisation of the cowries, loss of political and commercial independence) and the constraints caused by the mutations of the industrial revolution (diversion followed by disappearance of the large sailing ships, industrialisation of the coir). The Maldive Islands had lived for one millenium by following a unique piscatorial way of life, associating a perfected art of navigation with the exhaustive exploitation of the sole resource of the islands, the coconut tree, and of the infinite variety of products of coral reef and nearby ocean.
