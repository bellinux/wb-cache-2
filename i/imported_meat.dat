40|$|The paper {{develops}} {{dynamic model}} {{of demand for}} domestic and <b>imported</b> <b>meats</b> and compares {{the performance of the}} dynamic model called the general AIDS error correction model (GAECM) with the static linear approximate almost ideal demand system (LA/AIDS) model. A test for separability is developed based on the long-run solution to the dynamic model. The results indicate rejection of the static model in favor of the dynamic model. Homogeneity and symmetry are shown to hold for the dynamic model but are strongly rejected for the static model. Finally, separability between domestic and <b>imported</b> <b>meats</b> is rejected for all models at the 5 % level of significance. However, the results of the dynamic model based on the corrected likelihood test with a low p -value (p= 0. 038) indicate that rejection of separability is borderline.

40|$|Purpose of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} factors that influence <b>import</b> demand for <b>meat</b> in Malaysia. Four variables, namely real exchange rate, national income (GOP), lagged <b>import</b> quantity of <b>meat</b> and the dummy variable to take into account the currency pegging policy that has been practiced by Malaysia for the year 1997 to 2005 are identified and tested to determine each variable relationship with Malaysia <b>import</b> demand for <b>meat.</b> <b>Import</b> demand function that has been used by Aysen-Tanyeri-Abur and Parr Rosssonin (1997) paper titled Forecasting Mexican Import Demand for Diary Products has been adapted. In estimating the demand of <b>import</b> for <b>meat</b> in Malaysia, A double-log-linear functional form (Leamer et ai, 1970) is used as a functional for for the study. The secondary data was used and tested using SPSS software package and manual calculation. The result suggested that only two variables namely real exchange rate and country income are found significant towards determining Malaysia <b>import</b> demand for <b>meat</b> while the other two namely lag one year of import quantity and dummy variable (currency pegging policy that has been practiced by Malaysia in 1997 to 2005). The real exchange rate, national income and dummy variable that have been included had a positive relationship with <b>import</b> demand of <b>meat</b> while the lagged one year of import quantity had negative relationship with Malaysian <b>import</b> demand for <b>meat...</b>|$|R

50|$|The Nelson brothers, butchers in County Meath, Ireland, started {{shipping}} extensive live beef {{shipments to}} Liverpool, England. They successfully expanded their beef business until their imports from Ireland were insufficient to supply their rapidly growing business and Nelson decided {{to investigate the}} possibility of <b>importing</b> <b>meat</b> from Argentina. The first refrigerated ship they bought was Spindrift which they renamed in 1890 SS Highland Scot.

5000|$|The Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1907 (FMIA) is an American {{law that}} makes it a crime to {{adulterate}} or misbrand meat and meat products being sold as food, and ensures that meat and meat products are slaughtered and processed under sanitary conditions.

USDA inspection of poultry was added by the Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act authorizes the FDA to provide inspection services for all livestock and poultry species not listed in the FMIA or PPIA, including venison and buffalo. The Agricultural Marketing Act authorizes the USDA to offer voluntary, fee-for-service inspection services for these same species.|$|E

5000|$|According to the BBC, the era {{factory farming}} per se in Britain began in 1947 {{when a new}} Agriculture Act granted {{subsidies}} to farmers to encourage greater output by introducing new technology, {{in order to reduce}} Britain's reliance on <b>imported</b> <b>meat.</b> The United Nations writes that [...] "intensification of animal production was seen as a way of providing food security." [...] In 1966, the United States, United Kingdom and other industrialized nations, commenced factory farming of beef and dairy cattle and domestic pigs. [...] From its American and West European heartland factory farming became globalised in the later years of the 20th century and is still expanding and replacing traditional practices of stock rearing in an increasing number of countries.

5000|$|In November 1864, a {{wholesaler}} in Wilmington asked his {{agent in the}} Bahamas to stop sending so much chloroform and instead send [...] "essence of cognac" [...] because that perfume would sell [...] "quite high". Confederate patriots held rich blockade runners in contempt for profiteering on luxuries while the soldiers were in rags. On the other hand, their bravery and initiative were necessary for the nation's survival, and many women in the back country flaunted imported $10 gewgaws and $50 hats as patriotic proof that the [...] "damn yankees" [...] had failed to isolate them from the outer world. The government in Richmond, Virginia, eventually regulated the traffic, requiring half the imports to be munitions; it even purchased and operated some runners on its own account and made sure they loaded vital war goods. By 1864, Lee's soldiers were eating <b>imported</b> <b>meat.</b> Blockade running was reasonably safe for both sides. It was not illegal under international law; captured foreign sailors were released, while Confederates went to prison camps.

5000|$|In 1905, a {{spontaneous}} workers' movement {{took place in}} Santiago, encouraged by the anarchists. It {{came to be known}} as the Red Week. The movement started as a consequence of an unjustified repression by the police of a rally of protest against taxes on <b>imported</b> <b>meat.</b> The fierce repression and clashes with the police resulted in the deaths of around 200 workers. The indignation of the workers grew stronger and stronger, and most of the labour unions went on general strike. The government declared a state of siege and called upon the army to suppress the movement. The crowds attempted to take over the governmental palace, and even though they did not manage this, the city remained under their control.The response of the government was to increase the repression and to persecute the revolutionary anarchists and syndicalists who were the leaders of the movement. However, anarchist activity was still on the rise. The anarchist newspaper El Alba condemned the acts in an edition released in October 1905: [...] "The people have been assassinated with rage and malice by the young horde of the bourgeoisie. More than 500 citizens have been murdered vilely and cowardly, and more than 1500 were injured".|$|E
