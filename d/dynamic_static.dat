Among the thirteen strong aftershocks of the double main earthquakes, 90 % of the aftershocks occurred inside the triangle block are subjected to the triggering effect of <b>dynamic</b> and <b>static</b> Coulomb stresses induced by the first or the second main earthquakes.

40|$|Abstract. Improved {{methods to}} {{estimate}} the kinetics of <b>dynamic</b> and <b>static</b> recrystallization are proposed in this paper. The kinetics for <b>dynamic</b> and <b>static</b> recrystallization can be evaluated by inverse analysis of the flow curves obtained using the single-hit and double-hit hot compression tests carried out on Gleeble 3500. The <b>dynamic</b> and <b>static</b> recrystallization volume fractions {{can be seen as}} functions of plastic strain and time, respectively. The mathematical formulations between the recrystallization volume fractions and the dislocation density related to the flow stress are used in incremental forms in the study. The methods are applied to the hot compression tests of plain carbon steel and the kinetics of <b>dynamic</b> and <b>static</b> recrystallization are gained successfully for some conditions at elevated temperature. The results are clarified by comparing them with those reported in previous investigations. It is confirmed that the present methods can provide accurate kinetics for <b>dynamic</b> and <b>static</b> recrystallization with shorter time for experiment and computation...|$|R

40|$|Functional {{repair of}} {{neurotmesis}} {{has been proven}} most challenging in regenerative medicine. Progress in this field has shown that functional repair not only requires axon regeneration, but also selectivity in target reinnervation. Although selectivity in target reinnervation still involves relatively unexplored avenues, evidence-based medicine, in the end, requires behavioral proof of repair. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for tests assessing behavioral deficits after neurotmesis. To date, behavioral tests for detecting both <b>dynamic</b> and <b>static</b> parameters are limited. The CatWalk gait analysis has been shown to detect a multitude of speed-controlled <b>dynamic</b> and <b>static</b> gait deficits after experimental spinal cord injury. Therefore, we here evaluated its use in detecting both <b>dynamic</b> and <b>static</b> gait deficits after neurotmesis. After rat sciatic nerve resection CatWalk testing was performed for 8 weeks. A large amount of <b>dynamic</b> and <b>static</b> gait parameters were detected to be immediately and severely affected in the ipsilateral paw, sometimes reaching levels of only 15 % of those of the unaffected paw. We conclude that the CatWalk objectively detects <b>dynamic</b> and <b>static</b> gait impairments after sciatic nerve resection and future experiments are now required to prove which of these parameters are of particular interest to detect functional repair...|$|R

Balance was found to be a useful way of preventing ACL injuries as it builds strength within the knee. Improving balance is one of the first ways to recover after an ACL injury, studies have also found a series of jumping, landing, posture and change of direction to also help strengthen the knee. Balance is the ability to maintain the centre of mass of a body within the base of support. The two types of balance are, static and <b>dynamic.</b> <b>Static</b> been the ability to control your body when in a stationary position, while dynamic been the ability to have control of the body when moving. When trying to understand balance {{it is important}} to acknowledge three factors which are; mass, the area of the bass of support and position to the centre of gravity. Balance evolves around the base of support as well as the centre of gravity. For the injured footballer to obtain maximal benefits from this training then they will need to work on their balance consistently to build strength within both knees and around their whole body.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{static and}} dynamic policies for replenishing and allocating inventories amongst N retailers located along a fixed delivery route. Each retailer faces independent, normally-distributed period demand and incurs a proportional holding or backorder cost on end-of-period net-inventory. A warehouse places a system-replenishment order every m periods which is received after a fixed leadtime of T periods. Immediately upon receipt, a delivery vehicle leaves the warehouse with the system-replenishment quantity and {{travels to the}} retailers along a fixed route with fixed leadtimes between successive retailers. The warehouse holds no inventory. Under the "static" policy, allocations are determined for all retailers simultaneously {{at the moment the}} delivery vehicle leaves the warehouse. Under the "dynamic" policy, allocations are determined sequentially upon arrival of the delivery vehicle at each retailer. Our major analytical results, under appropriate <b>dynamic</b> (<b>static)</b> allocation assumptions, are: (1) optimal allocations under each policy involve bringing each retailer's "normalized-inventory" to a corresponing "normalized" system inventory; (2) optimal system replenishments are base-stock policies; (3) the minimum expected cost per cycle of <b>dynamic</b> (<b>static)</b> policy can be derived from an equivalent <b>dynamic</b> (<b>static)</b> composite retailer. Given this, we prove that the "risk-pooling incentive" [...] -a simple measure of the benefit from adopting dynamic allocation policies [...] -is always positive. Our simulation tests confirm that dynamic allocation policies yield lower costs than static policies, {{regardless of whether or not}} their respective allocation assumptions are valid. However, the magnitude of the cost savings is very sensitive to some system parameters. multi-echelon inventory system, dynamic allocations, allocation-and-replenishment policy...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} {{diagnostic}} {{accuracy of the}} clinical examination of the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) and of the <b>dynamic</b> and <b>static</b> pain tests for the recognition of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) pain. Methods: A blind examination, including all clinical tests needed for a RDC diagnosis of TMD pain, and the <b>dynamic</b> and <b>static</b> pain tests, was performed in 125 chronic TMD pain patients, 88 chronic dental pain patients, and 121 pain-free subjects. Allocation was based upon {{the results of an}} oral history and a dental examination. As indicators for diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the RDC examination and of the <b>dynamic</b> and <b>static</b> pain tests were compared to recommended levels of. 70 and. 90, respectively. Results: For the RDC examination, high sensitivity (. 88), but lower specificity (. 45 -. 71) was found. The specificity did not reach its recommended level. For the <b>dynamic</b> and <b>static</b> pain tests, specificity (. 84 -. 91) and sensitivity (. 65) did not differ from the recommended levels. Comparing the outcomes of the two examinations showed that the positive likelihood ratios of the <b>dynamic</b> and <b>static</b> pain tests were higher (p<. 001), while the negative likelihood ratios of the RDC examination were lower (p<. 01). Conclusion: For the confirmation of a suspected TMD origin of orofacial pain, it is better to rely on the <b>dynamic</b> and <b>static</b> pain tests. To rule out a TMD origin, more value should be attached to the RDC examination (no funding sources) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} diverse displacements of structures {{is an important}} index {{for the evaluation of}} a structure’s safety. In this study, a comparative analysis was conducted to determine the integrated RTK-GPS/accelerometer method that can provide the most precise structure displacement measurements. For this purpose, three methods of calculating the dynamic displacements from the acceleration data were comparatively analyzed. In addition, two methods of determining <b>dynamic,</b> <b>static,</b> and quasi-static displacements by integrating the displacements measured from the RTK-GPS system and the accelerometer were also comparatively analyzed. To ensure precise comparison results, a cantilever beam was manufactured onto which diverse types of displacements were generated to evaluate the measurement accuracy by method. Linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) measurements were used as references for the evaluation to ensure accuracy. The study results showed that the most suitable method of measuring the dynamic displacement with the accelerometer was to calculate the displacement by filtering and double-integrating the acceleration data using the FIR band-pass filter. The integration method that uses frequency-based displacement extraction was most appropriate for the integrated RTK-GPS/accelerometer method of comprehensively measuring the <b>dynamic,</b> <b>static,</b> and quasi-static displacements...|$|E
