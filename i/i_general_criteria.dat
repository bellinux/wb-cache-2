The task of these fast and frugal algorithms is to infer unknown features {{of their environment}} under the constraints of limited knowledge, limited time, and limited computational capacities. These algorithms violate fundamental tenets of classical rationality: They neither look up nor integrate all information. I review {{the performance of the}} satisficing "Take The Best" algorithm. Despite its frugality, Take The Best can make as many correct inferences as computationally expensive weighted linear models that use and combine all available information. Accurate inferences need not follow the dictates of classical rationality. ...|$|R

In this article <b>I</b> present <b>general</b> <b>criteria</b> for judging the scientific value of a research report submitted for publication. These criteria can improve {{the quality of}} research articles and produce fair referee reports that are scientifically justifiable. My view is based on four fundamental rules that guide all good science. These rules ought to determine whether scientific research reports merit publication in scientific journals. The rules for good science also structure this article. They are as follows. [1] Scientists must use specialised problem-solving; [2] scientists must refer to previous work; [3] scientists must justify their findings; and [4] scientists must convince their scientific community...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{activity}} recognition task from a machine learning perspective. I give {{a definition of}} this problem, and I classify different activity recognition problems into two categories. I show the activities can be hierarchical, and based on such hierarchies I synthesize a language to describe activities. <b>I</b> give a <b>general</b> <b>criteria</b> set to evaluate activity recognition methods. I summarize some off-the-shelf machine learning methods for activity recognition and evaluate them based on this criteria set. Finally, I discuss some methods that I believe can improve the activity recognition performance...|$|R
40|$|Defining {{ecological}} boundary as {{an outer}} envelope of an ecological entity {{such as an}} individual, colony, population, community, an ecosystem, or any other discernible unit provides methodological benefits and should thus enhance existing perspectives and research protocols. I argue that, because boundaries are features of entities, {{the first step in}} investigation of boundary structure and properties should involve identification of the entity the presumed boundary of interest belongs to. <b>I</b> use a <b>general</b> perspective where ecological systems are parts of a larger system and themselves are made of subsystems (or entities). Such a general hierarchy of ecological objects offers guidance as to how boundaries can be found for specific systems, and how their investigations might lead to reliable and generalizable insights. In particular, it may help in (a) categorizing types of boundaries based on mechanisms leading to formation of entities; (b) deciding what is and what is not a boundary by clarifying the nature of discontinuities seen in nature (e. g., sharp habitat transitions or weak separation of entities); (c) assisting in selecting fruitful resolution at which boundaries are examined; (d) approaching boundaries in complex, nested systems; and (e) deciding what criteria to use in answering questions about a particular boundary type. To facilitate the above <b>I</b> provide <b>general</b> <b>criteria</b> one may use for identifying ecological entities. Such criteria should assist in focusing on boundaries appropriate for a given research question. Finally, where advancing the theoretical framework for ecological boundaries is concerned, the diversity of boundary types will be better served when reorganized in relation to the concept of entity as discussed below...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A <b>general</b> <b>criterion</b> for integer {{ambiguity}} searching {{is derived}} in this paper. The criterion {{takes into account}} not only the residuals caused by ambiguity parameter changing, but also the residuals caused by coordinates changing through ambiguity fixing. The search {{can be carried out}} in a coordinate domain, in an ambiguity domain or in both domains. The three searching scenarios are theoretically equivalent. The optimality and uniqueness properties of the proposed criterion are also discussed. A numerical explanation of the <b>general</b> <b>criterion</b> is outlined. The theoretical relationship between the <b>general</b> <b>criterion</b> and the commonly used least squares ambiguity search (LSAS) criterion is derived in an equivalent case in detail. It shows that the LSAS criterion {{is just one of the}} terms of the equivalent criterion. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the behaviour of the two components of the equivalent criterion...|$|R

40|$|A common {{scenario}} on the motorway is {{that traffic}} {{that appears to}} be moving smoothly can suddenly spontaneously break down.

The <b>general</b> <b>criterion</b> is shown to agree with the specific stability conditions of these models, including those in which drivers taken into account vehicles more than one ahead. As described in the literature, when the flow is stable, columns of vehicles are seen to smooth any perturbations to the flow. This enables the <b>general</b> <b>criterion</b> to be extended to include non-identical drivers. The stability criterion is also seen to agree with those established from continuum theory. Finally, the stability condition is considered with respect to data obtained from the M 25 in the U. K. ...|$|R
