40|$|The {{benefits}} of wave rotor-topping in turboshaft engines, subsonic high-bypass turbofan engines, auxiliary <b>power</b> <b>units,</b> and <b>ground</b> <b>power</b> <b>units</b> are evaluated. The thermodynamic cycle performance is modeled using a one-dimensional steady-state code; wave rotor performance is modeled using one-dimensional design/analysis codes. Design and off-design engine performance is calculated for baseline engines and wave rotor-topped engines, where the wave rotor {{acts as a}} high pressure spool. The wave rotor-enhanced engines are shown to have benefits in specific power and specific fuel flow over the baseline engines without increasing turbine inlet temperature. The off-design steady-state behavior of a wave rotor-topped engine is shown {{to be similar to}} a conventional engine. Mission studies are performed to quantify aircraft performance benefits for various wave rotor cycle and weight parameters. Gas turbine engine cycles most likely to benefit from wave rotor-topping are identified.

40|$|Abstract-Static power {{converters}} {{are used for}} many applications, like frequency converters for motors, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS’s), general power supplies. This paper analyses the performance of high power static 400 Hz supply system used in aircraft <b>ground</b> <b>power</b> <b>units.</b> However, the problem of this system is the harmonics coming from the load current towards the supply. This problem can be overcome by using a way to improve the supply wave. One of those is using novel polygon transformer. This paper presents combining of stabilized power AC-DC-AC supply using polygon transformer to improve the supply wave and using a passive filter on the output load. The design and simulation of this system has been presented. In [8], the polygon transformer is connected to achieve 18 -pulse AC-DC conversion through phase shifting between {{the two sets of}} voltages equal 20 ° with respect to the supply voltage. The disadvantage of this connection is that realizing feasible values for the tapping portion for step up operation is not possible. Therefore, in the proposed system, a novel idea for the 18 pulse conversion is achieved by phase shifting between voltage sets with 40 °. Keywords- Stabilizing power AC-DC-AC converter...|$|R

In order to satisfy the stringent requirements of the output voltage quality particular attention {{is given to the}} controller. The common dc link topology of the converter allows circulation of Zero Sequence Current (ZSC), therefore also a 0 axis regulator is necessary.

50|$|Similar {{to shore}} power for ships, a <b>ground</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> (GPU) {{may be used}} to supply {{electric}} power for an aircraft on the ground, to sustain interior lighting, ventilation and other requirements before starting of the main engines or the aircraft auxiliary power unit (APU). It is also used by aircraft with APUs if the airport authority does not permit the usage of APUs at its docks or if the carrier wishes to save on the use of jet fuel (which APUs use). This may be a self-contained engine-generator set, or it may convert commercial power to the voltage and frequency needed for the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{power voltage}} and frequency varies {{from country to country}} and sometimes within a country. In North America and northern South America it is usually 120 volt, 60 hertz (Hz), but in Europe, Asia, Africa and many other parts of the world, it is usually 230 volt, 50 Hz. Aircraft often use 400 Hz power internally, so 50 Hz or 60 Hz to 400 Hz frequency conversion is needed for use in the <b>ground</b> <b>power</b> <b>unit</b> used to power the airplane while it is on the ground. Conversely, internal 400 Hz internal power may be converted to 50 Hz or 60 Hz for convenience power outlets available to passengers during flight.|$|E
50|$|The Boeing 720 lacked an {{auxiliary}} <b>power</b> <b>unit,</b> and relied instead on <b>ground</b> <b>power</b> and pneumatic air {{to power the}} aircraft's systems, provide air conditioning, and start the engines while on the ground.
