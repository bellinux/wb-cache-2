The prime objective of any industrial {{process is to}} perform efficiently with optimum cost reduction. <b>Internal</b> <b>Model</b> Control (IMC) is a commonly used technique that provides a transparent mode for the designing and easy tuning of control structure. I have designed the <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> control for binary distillation column. The transfer function has been taken from Wood and Berry <b>model.</b> The <b>internal</b> <b>model</b> control has been designed considering three strategies namely, process perfect, process mismatch with disturbances and process model with considering only disturbance. It has also been tried to reduce the disturbance created in the system by varying tuning parameter (ë). In the second proposal, Lead-Lag based <b>Internal</b> <b>Model</b> Control method is proposed based on <b>Internal</b> <b>Model</b> Control (IMC) strategy. We have also designed the Lead-Lag based <b>Internal</b> <b>Model</b> Control for binary distillation column. We have found the composition control and disturbance rejection using Lead-Lag based IMC and comparing with the response of generalize <b>Internal</b> <b>Model</b> Controller.

500|$|In {{discussing}} the neurobiological basis for attachment and trauma symptoms in a seven-year twin study, {{it has been}} suggested that the roots of various forms of psychopathology, including RAD, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can be found in disturbances in affect regulation. The subsequent development of higher-order self-regulation is jeopardized and the formation of <b>internal</b> <b>models</b> is affected. Consequently, the [...] "templates" [...] in the mind that drive organized behavior in relationships may be impacted. The potential for [...] "re-regulation" [...] (modulation of emotional responses to within the normal range) in the presence of [...] "corrective" [...] experiences (normative caregiving) seems possible.|$|E
500|$|Early {{experiences}} with caregivers gradually {{give rise to}} a system of thoughts, memories, beliefs, expectations, emotions, and behaviours about the self and others. This system, called the [...] "internal working model of social relationships", continues to develop with time and experience. <b>Internal</b> <b>models</b> regulate, interpret, and predict attachment-related behaviour in the self and the attachment figure. As they develop in line with environmental and developmental changes, they incorporate the capacity to reflect and communicate about past and future attachment relationships. They enable the child to handle new types of social interactions; knowing, for example, that an infant should be treated differently from an older child, or that interactions with teachers and parents share characteristics. This internal working model continues to develop through adulthood, helping cope with friendships, marriage, and parenthood, all of which involve different behaviours and feelings. The development of attachment is a transactional process. Specific attachment behaviours begin with predictable, apparently innate, behaviours in infancy. They change with age in ways that are determined partly by experiences and partly by situational factors. As attachment behaviours change with age, they do so in ways shaped by relationships. A child's behaviour when reunited with a caregiver is determined not only by how the caregiver has treated the child before, but on the history of effects the child has had on the caregiver.|$|E
