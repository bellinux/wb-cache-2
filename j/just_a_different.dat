5|$|The only studio recording, made in New York by Nonesuch {{two months}} after the Oct. 1987 Houston premiere, used the same cast, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> chorus, {{orchestra}} and conductor: Edo de Waart led the Chorus and Orchestra of St. Luke's. Gramophone’s Good DVD Guide praised the singing, noting James Maddalena’s “aptly volatile Nixon” and Trudy Ellen Craney’s admirable delivery of Chiang Ch’ing’s coloratura passages. This recording also received the 1988 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Composition in the Classical category. It was reissued in 2011 to coincide with the opera’s production at the Metropolitan Opera. The Denver live recording on Naxos has Marin Alsop conducting the Colorado Symphony Orchestra and Opera Colorado Chorus, with Robert Orth as Nixon, Maria Kanyova as Pat Nixon, Thomas Hammons as Kissinger, Chen-Ye Yuan as Chou En-Lai, Marc Heller as Mao Tse-Tung and Tracy Dahl as Chiang Ch’ing. Sumi Jo and June Anderson star as the two wives in the Paris video.|$|E

25|$|Casting {{the lead}} roles of Duck, You Sucker! {{proved to be}} a {{difficult}} process. The role of John Mallory was written for Jason Robards, who had played Cheyenne in Once Upon a Time in the West. However, the studio wanted a bigger name for his character. Clint Eastwood was then approached by Leone for the role, but he saw it as <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> take of the same character he had already played in the Dollars Trilogy, and he also wanted to end his association with the Italian film industry. As a result, he declined the offer and starred in Hang 'Em High instead. George Lazenby was then approached to play John, but he declined. A young Malcolm McDowell, then mostly known for his performance in if...., was considered for both John and Nolan, John’s Irish friend, but Leone eventually settled on James Coburn to play John. Coburn had previously been considered for other Leone projects, including A Fistful of Dollars and Once Upon a Time in the West. He had also previously been considered for a role in another United Artists-financed Zapata Western, Sergio Corbucci's The Mercenary, but Franco Nero was later cast in what was originally his role.|$|E

McCartney claimed that his long-standing dissatisfaction with the released version of [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] (and the entire Let It Be album) was in part {{the impetus for the}} new version. The new album included a later take of [...] "The Long and Winding Road", recorded on 31 January. [...] With no strings or other added instrumentation beyond that which was played in the studio at the time, it was closer to the Beatles's original intention than the 1970 version. This take is also the one seen in the film Let It Be and on the Beatles' 2015 video compilation 1. Starr said of the Let It Be... Naked version: [...] "There's nothing wrong with Phil's strings , this is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> attitude to listening. But it's been 30-odd years since I've heard it without all that and it just blew me away." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Field, the {{transition}} from writing music for an adult rock band to writing children's music was not a big one for The Wiggles. [...] "The Wiggles music isn't all that far removed from {{what we did in}} The Cockroaches, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> subject matter", Field stated. [...] "The Cockroaches sing about girls and love and stuff like that; The Wiggles sing about hot potatoes and cold spaghetti." [...] Moran stated that The Wiggles wrote songs they liked and would listen to, and then made them appropriate for children. [...] They approached simple and relocatable topics, such as food and nutrition, as teachers would in a pre-school setting, with simple melodies that were easy for children to sing and remember. [...] The group sang the same 60s-style pop as The Cockroaches, but with different lyrics, although they were not confined to songs about love and could write about anything that interested and excited young children, which was limitless. [...] The music they chose to write and perform was influenced by nursery rhymes, folk music, and rock songs of the 1950s and 1960s. [...] Page reported, [...] "First and foremost, we're entertainers". [...] The Wiggles captured the interest of children by first entertaining them, and then by presenting them with educational messages.|$|E
500|$|In October 2012, {{following}} its legal victory over Joe Shuster's estate {{for the rights}} to Superman, Warner Bros. Pictures announced that it planned to move ahead with its long-awaited Justice League film, uniting such DC Comics superheroes as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. The company was expected to take the opposite approach to Marvel, releasing individual films for the characters after they have appeared in a team-up film. The release of Man of Steel in 2013 was intended to be {{the start of a new}} shared universe for DC, [...] "laying the groundwork for the future slate of films based on DC Comics." [...] In 2014, Warner Bros. announced that slate of films, similarly to Disney and Marvel claiming dates for films years in advance. That year, DC CCO Geoff Johns stated that the television series Arrow and The Flash were set in a separate universe from the new film one, later clarifying that [...] "We look at it as the multiverse. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> approach [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1991, Anthony Field founded The Wiggles, a children's music group, {{with fellow}} {{university}} students Murray Cook and Greg Page, Phillip Wilcher (from Macquarie University's music department) and The Cockroaches' band mate, Jeff Fatt. In July, they issued their debut album, The Wiggles, which {{was dedicated to}} Paul Field's daughter and sold 70,000 copies. The Wiggles {{went on to become}} [...] "a global powerhouse in children's entertainment". They used former The Cockroaches' members for musical and performing support: Paul, John, and Henry (The Wiggles' character Henry the Octopus was named after him) performed with them on their CDs, DVDs, and stage shows. John helped them write many of their songs. Many early The Wiggles' songs were The Cockroaches' tunes reworked to fit the genre of children's music. According to Anthony, [...] "The Wiggles music isn't all that far removed from what we did in The Cockroaches, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> subject matter... The Cockroaches sing about girls and love and stuff like that; The Wiggles sing about hot potatoes and cold spaghetti". Paul worked for James Roland Wood, Chief Judge at Common Law, for three years after the band stopped regularly performing and during The Wiggles' formation, which he said gave Anthony time to develop his new band alone, without much input from his brothers. In the mid-1990s, Paul became The Wiggles' talent manager.|$|E

500|$|Even {{though the}} show was set in Miami, filming took place at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Stock {{exterior}} shots of Miami {{were used for the}} opening credits and transitions between scenes. The series was filmed with a multiple-camera setup, with each episode last roughly 20 to 22 minutes excluding commercials. Eve said she was initially intimidated by the amount of work required to prepare for and film a television series. During an interview with Billboard, she explained that while filming the first season she felt like she [...] "just wanted to leave because there was so much to learn, it's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> world". Since she found comedy to be challenging due to the [...] "certain beats you have to learn", Eve hired two acting coaches to help improve her timing. One of her coaches was Chip Fields, who visited the show's set to offer Eve acting advice. During the development of the second season, Eve viewed the set as her home, and felt the process was easier, having grown closer to the cast and crew. In a 2016 interview with Grazia, she revealed her regret at not fully committing herself to her character and the series. She explained: [...] "I was the youngest person on set and was clubbing in between being on set and learning my lines. I look back and wish I was more dedicated. But I learned from it." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Quesada {{confirmed}} in April 2014 that the Netflix series {{would be set}} within the MCU.

It does take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all connected. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we would look up in the sky and see [...] It's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> part of New York that we have not yet seen in the Marvel movies." [...] In January 2015, Netflix COO Ted Sarandos said Netflix planned to release a Marvel series approximately a year apart from each other after Daredevils April 2015 release. A year later, Sarandos noted that the release schedules of the Marvel Netflix series are dependent on the [...] "long production times and long post times. In some cases, when we have characters crossover, it makes it more difficult to manage production. It's not the goal to put out {{more than one or two}} [...] year ... The complex one is really The Defenders. The Defenders production schedule will determine a lot of the season 2 and 3 output of those shows." [...] He also noted on potential spin-offs that [...] "all the characters in the universe could also spin out" [...] into their own series at some point, with Netflix ordering Marvel's The Punisher, a spin-off from Daredevil, that April. Sarandos later stated that Netflix was trying to close the gap between releases of Marvel seasons, but would always prioritize the quality of the series over higher numbers of releases per year. He also said that Netflix was open to exploring the MCU beyond the Defenders series, including potential crossovers with ABC's Marvel series.|$|E

500|$|During 2007 spring practice, Scott {{was third}} on the depth chart, but {{suffered}} a left knee injury, which forced him to miss most of camp. During the 2007 season, he played in nine games as a reserve tailback behind Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore and as a kickoff returner. Despite the team's abundance of running backs, Friedgen wanted to utilize Scott in some capacity because of his speed, which had been recorded at 4.25seconds in the 40-yard dash. Maryland wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey said, [...] "On paper it says I'm faster, but Da'Rel, he's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> type of animal." [...] Against Wake Forest, he saw his first action when he returned four kickoffs for 101yards. Scott's special teams performance in that game sufficiently impressed head coach Friedgen that he said, [...] "I think I've {{got to try to}} get him involved within the offense. I think he's a guy that can make some plays for us." [...] The following week, unranked Maryland upset 10th-ranked Rutgers, and Scott made his first career appearance as a tailback. He had three carries for 29yards. After sitting out the Georgia Tech game because of an ankle injury, he returned four kicks for 68yards against Virginia, three for 56yards against Clemson, and two for 40yards against North Carolina. Against eighth-ranked Boston College, Scott caught a short screen pass from quarterback Chris Turner and ran 57yards for a touchdown. It was his first career reception and first career touchdown. It was one of just two offensive plays for Scott in that game, and incidentally, he was not intended to be in it. Friedgen said:"When he was in the game, I didn't even know he was in the game. I called a screen pass. I looked up, and it was Da'Rel in there. I figured we were just giving Lance a rest, but I asked [...] Zacharias about it Sunday and he started laughing. I said 'Did you put Da'Rel in for that screen pass?' He said, 'Lance's equipment was broken, so he had to go in the game.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{entirely new}} {{proposal}} {{has been made}} by A. Willi, who suggests that the original name of the letter in ancient Greek was angma (...) [...] This proposal {{is based on a}} passage in a Latin grammarian, Varro, who uses this name for what he calls a [...] "25th letter" [...] of the alphabet. Varro himself is clearly not referring to sampi, but is using angma to refer to the ng sound [...] in words like angelus. However, Varro ascribes the use of the name angma to an ancient Ionian Greek author, Ion of Chios. Willi conjectures that Varro misunderstood Ion, believing the name angma referred to the [...] sound because that sound happened to occur in the name itself. However, Ion, in speaking of a [...] "25th letter of the alphabet", meant not <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> pronunciation of some other letters but an actual written letter in its own right, namely sampi.
