40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the performances of the equity funds based on Risk-Adjusted Return using Sharpe, Treynor, Jensen, M^ 2 and Information Ratio methods along with comparison between the performances of the equity funds and benchmark performance in research periods.

The data analysis using Sharpe and Treynor methods produced the same results; In 2011 there are 20 equity <b>funds</b> <b>with</b> positive performances.

5|$|G. Homer Durham, {{a member}} of the First Quorum of the Seventy, {{replaced}} Joseph Anderson as director of the Historical Department in 1977 and began restraining the History Division's activity. Durham required that all manuscripts go through him for approval before publication. He attempted to combine the Mormon History Trust <b>Fund</b> <b>with</b> the general department budget, but was prevented by Arrington. Durham also refrained from hiring new staff members to replace staff who had left. The multi-volume church history project was dropped, allowing the outside authors to seek publishers other than Deseret Book who would give them royalties and not be tempted to sanitize church history. Not all twelve authors completed their projects, but many books that started from the History Division project were later published through other publishers.|$|E
40|$|I {{examine the}} impact of hedge fund {{managers}} selling ownership stakes in their firms to outside owners. <b>Funds</b> <b>with</b> outside owners do not subsequently outperform a matched sample of funds but do attract higher flows, suggesting that managers sell stakes to obtain strategic growth partners. The flow impact is greater for i) <b>funds</b> <b>with</b> lower prior flows or performance, ii) smaller funds, and iii) <b>funds</b> <b>with</b> more reputable outside owners. Outsiders also monitor their investments as <b>funds</b> <b>with</b> outside owners reduce their returns management. The reduction in return management is stronger after the 2008 financial crisis when institutions’ reputations are more tarnished. Combined, the results indicate that outside ownership benefits managers, outsiders, and fund investors...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} delegated {{investment management}} in private pension accounts {{using data from}} Australian accumulation (superannuation) funds. In Australian non-profit pension funds, trustees choose investment managers on behalf of members. We find that <b>funds</b> <b>with</b> many delegated managers have higher risk-adjusted returns than those <b>with</b> few. However <b>funds</b> <b>with</b> 13 or less specialized managers show no improvement over <b>funds</b> <b>with</b> a single diversified manager. All do worse than a benchmark portfolio of asset-class indices. Further, by using random selection to mimic the choices of an uninformed individual choosing from the same menu of delegate managers as used by trustees, we show that returns from pension <b>funds</b> <b>with</b> large numbers of trustee-selected managers compare favorably with returns from randomly selected, equally weighted portfolios. However this improvement falls off quickly for <b>funds</b> <b>with</b> fewer trustee-selected managers, or when randomly selected portfolios are also diversified across asset classes. Results indicate that an uninformed individual following a naive diversification strategy would have done {{as well as most}} trustee boards in this sample. ...|$|R
5|$|In 1981, the Seeley G. Mudd Fund granted Vassar $1.3 {{million for}} the {{construction}} of a new chemistry building. Mudd was a California-based cardiologist, professor, and trustee with the University of Southern California's School of Medicine as well as with a number of other West Coast schools. Over his lifetime, Mudd donated more than $10 million to higher education institutions and upon his death in 1968, his will established a further $44 million for building construction at universities and colleges, with the stipulation that institutions requesting a grant provide at least half the funds for their projects and that his name be prominently displayed on any buildings receiving the funding. While the cost of the building was originally reported to be $4.5 million, this estimate grew to $6.5 million by 1984 and would ultimately come to $7.2 million once the project was completed. The College planned to cover the costs not paid for by the Mudd <b>Fund</b> <b>with</b> a $100 million development fundraising program that spanned the entirety of the 1980s.|$|E

Although a CBA resulted, many players felt that the agreement did not net them as many benefits as they had hoped. The owners agreed to contribute about $1.5 million to the pension <b>fund</b> <b>with</b> minimum salaries of $9,000 for rookies, $10,000 for veterans and $50 per exhibition game; there was at yet no neutral arbitration for disputes.|$|E
5|$|MIGA's inaugural {{investment}} guarantees {{were issued}} in 1990 to cover $1.04billion ($1.83billion in 2012dollars) worth of foreign direct investment(FDI) comprising four individual projects. The agency also issued its first reinsurance contracts signed {{in collaboration with}} Export Development Canada and the United States' Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). That same year, MIGA held a conference in Ghana to promote investment. The agency joined the Berne Union, an international community of export credit and investment insurance providers in 1994. In 1997, MIGA issued the inaugural contract under its Cooperative Underwriting Program to support an energy project in Indonesia. In collaboration with the European Union Investment Trust Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the agency set up a fund for investment guarantees amounting to $12million ($17million in 2012dollars). The agency also established the West Bank and Gaza Investment Guarantee Trust <b>Fund</b> <b>with</b> a capacity of $20million ($29million in 2012dollars). In 1998 the Council of Governors of MIGA adopted a resolution establishing a general capital increase of $850million ($1.2billion in 2012dollars), and transferring a grant of $150million ($212million in 2012dollars) from the IBRD. MIGA exceeded $1billion ($1.4billion in 2012 dollars) in investment guarantees within a single {{year for the first}} time in 1999.

In May 1974, he {{embarked}} on his first concert appearance outside of the United States, a show at the London Palladium for the Variety Club of Great Britain to aid children's charities. It was here where he discovered what he had been missing when the audience cheered for ten minutes after he walked onstage. At the show's end, Como sat in a chair, delightedly chatting back and forth with his equally delighted fans. Perry returned to the United Kingdom in November for a Royal Variety Performance to benefit the Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent <b>Fund</b> <b>with</b> the Queen Mother in attendance. Como was invited to visit Buckingham Palace the day after the show. At first, the invitation did not extend to his associates traveling and working with him, and Como politely declined. When word reached the Palace regarding the reason for Perry's turning down the invitation, it was then extended to include all in the Como party and Como accepted this invitation. Soon after, he announced his first concert tour that began in the UK in the spring of 1975.|$|E
