Flue gas desulphurization <b>and</b> <b>deNOx</b> involve adding chemicals to the flow stream, thereby resulting in increased mass flow. This problem could be overcome by reducing the pressure drop in the duct work and stack combination, so that a higher flow at reduced pressure drop can be handled by the existing fans. In this study, a power plant stack model of 1 : 40 was investigated numerically. The pressure reduction was achieved by introduction of baffles with various orientations and turning vanes at the inlet of the stack.

The results (probing depth of approximately 4 nm) show that Fe/ZSM 5 is an extremely flexible redox system. The calcination procedure (severe calcination: heating rate 5 degreesC min(- 1), as normally used in the literature; mild calcination: heating rate 0. 5 degreesC min(- 1)) is proven to be important to optimise the reducibility of iron. Upon mild calcination Fe/ZSM 5 has an average valence of 2. 9 under oxygen (5 % in helium), of 2. 5 under pure helium at room temperature (RT), and of 2. 1 under pure helium at 350 degreesC. Upon severe calcination Fe/ZSM 5 shows higher average valences, {{in agreement with the}} assumption that part of the iron in this sample is positioned in small iron-oxide nanoparticles at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals. During heating in helium, the valence reaches a minimum value before slightly rising again (re-oxidation) when the temperature is kept constant.

Field PM measurements were carried out at the horizontal ducts at the inlets of the DeNOx units, {{as well as the}} inlets and outlets of the two dust collectors when the two boilers burned the same coal under identical combustion conditions. The PM and total fly ash were collected via a low-pressure impactor (LPI) and/or a smoke analyzer. The collected samples were then subjected to analysis for chemical composition and morphology using an X-ray fluorescence (XRF) probe and a field emission scanning microscope with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (FESEM-EDX). The results show that both the ESPs and the FFs can effectively capture PM, with a PM 2. 5 collection efficiency of 99. 63 % and 99. 95 %, respectively. For the PM with similar properties, the collection efficiencies in the FFs are only marginally higher than those in the ESPs. The most notable discrepancies between the fractional PM removal efficiencies of ESPs and FFs are observed for PM in the size range 0. 3 – 2 μm. The PM removal performance of both the ESPs and the FFs is related to particle size. At 0. 3 – 2 μm, the performance of the ESPs is more sensitive to particle size than the FFs. The PM collection efficiency of the FFs is inversely related to particle size, and the capture of PM around 0. 4 μm is slightly weak, most likely due to the transition of capture mechanisms from impaction to Brownian diffusion...|$|R

Many of the techniques available today {{have been on the}} market for a long time, however, most of them still have a potential for improvement. To be able to optimize existing techniques it is crucial to increase the understanding of the processes taking place within the scrubber, i. e. chemistry, mass transfer and fluid dynamcis. Mathemathical modeling is an important tool for increasing the understanding. This research work was divided into two different parts: the first part focused on identifying suitable absorbents for wet NOx removal and the second part focused on deriving a model for absorption of SO 2 into a limestone slurry, wet flue gas desulfurization. The ability to absorb NOx were tested in a bubbler for the most common oxidizing agents and EDTA. Further experiments were done with the most promising absorbents, NaClO 2 and KMnO 4, in a packed column where the chemistry was studied in more detail. The absorption process was modeled and rate constants describing the absorption were estimated. A model based on the penetration theory was derived to calculate the absorption of SO 2 into a limestone slurry droplet. The model includes instantaneous acid-base reactions as well as reactions with finite rates, e. g. limestone dissolution, CO 2 hydrolysis, etc. The model was used to quantify the extent of spatial variations in mass transfer within a spray scrubber and the impact of the reactions with finite rate on SO 2 mass transfer.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{coal-fired}} power plants have increased {{their role in the}} global energy scenario thanks to reliability, security of fuel supply and lower cost of fuel and electricity. In this framework global warming issues require a sustainable use of coal and great efforts for greenhouse gases reduction, addressing research and development projects towards more efficient solutions in terms of efficiency and environmental impact. With this aim in this paper a performance assessment of an Ultra Super Critical (USC) steam plant integrated with a CO 2 removal section was carried out. The study is based on simulation models specifically developed through Aspen-Plus and Gate-Cycle software platforms. Performance was assessed referring to typical USC commercial size plants (400 - 600 MW), fuelled by a mix of a low-sulphur coal and a Sardinian (Sulcis) high-sulphur coal. The USC plant, based on a reheated and regenerative Rankine cycle, is integrated with an SNOX section, with integrated <b>DeNOx</b> <b>and</b> <b>DeSOx</b> processes, <b>and</b> a low temperature CO 2 capture section. The SNOX technology shows several advantages in comparison to conventional de-nitrification and de-sulphuration systems. In particular it is capable to remove both nitrogen and sulphur oxides, requiring less energy absorption compared to traditional FGD systems, allowing a further preheating of the combustion air and without producing process waste. Besides the SNOX releases a commercial product as the sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) and operational costs are reduced when sulphur content in the coal increases. The CO 2 capture system was based on a chemical absorption process. A conventional system based on an amine (monoethanolamine, MEA) aqueous solution was considered. In order to match high pressure and purity CO 2 transportation requirements, the CO 2 removal section is also integrated with a conditioning and compression section. A performance assessment of the USC plant was carried out varying the high-sulphur coal share on the coal mix and the main operating parameters of gas conditioning and purification sections. In particular a performance analysis was carried out to assess the influence of SNOX parameters on gas purification, CO 2 removal process and USC performance. An in-depth analysis of energy penalization due to the CO 2 capture systems was also performed, evaluating influence of CO 2 removal efficiency. Results shows that SNOX technology influences USC performances differently according to high-sulphur coal share in the coal mix. A great high-sulphur coal share sensibly increases sulphur content in the exhaust gas, reducing the methane requirements of the SNOX burner for reaching operational temperature and thus reducing penalties on USC performance. It is important to point up that an increase of the high-sulphur coal share can lead to exceed emissions limit for sulphur oxides, requiring to optimize the SNOX design. Integration with the CO 2 removal section leads to a noteworthy USC plant efficiency reduction of about 10. 5 percentage points. The CO 2 specific emissions, which for the reference plant were about 760 g/kWh, are marginally influenced by the SNOX system, but are greatly reduced by the introduction of the CO 2 removal system, decreasing to about 100 g/kWh...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis was the {{synthesis}} of organized mesoporous materials containing transition metals and lanthanides {{by the use of}} self-assembly systems. The structure, the composition, the porosity and the morphology were checked. Also the solids were tested about their redox catalytic applications in <b>deNOx</b> <b>and</b> <b>deSOx</b> reactions <b>and</b> in the dry reforming of methane. The method of synthesis is a one step procedure and includes, except CTAB, the polyacrylic acid (Pac) as a co-structure directing agent. Pac and CTAB are complexed by zip-type mechanism creating the mesophase, which act as a backbone of the structure. The complexion is based on the ionic interaction between the positively charged polar head of CTAB and the carboxyl anion of Pac. On the external surface of this mesophase hydrolysis of TEOS (source of silicon) takes place producing negative charged silica oligomers. On the same time cations of transition metals and lathanides are introduced in the mesostructure by their complexion with carboxyl group of Pac. This procedure is simply promoted by the increase of pH. At pH = 2 all the reagents are dissolved in water, the carboxyl groups of Pac are in molecular form (-COOH) and TEOS is not hydrolyzed. At pH = 3. 5 some tiny soft matter particles are appeared and at pH = 5 the mesostructured solids have already formed. The samples are collected at pH values between 5. 5 and 9. 5. By the aforementioned methodology organized mesoporous silicious materials containing Co, Ce plus Co, Ni and La plus Ni are prepared. The content of transition metals Co and Ni increases linear with the values of pH. On the other hand La and Ce are totally incorporated in the mesostructured solids at acidic values of pH. The calcined samples exhibit ordered pores structure that is changed from the two dimension hexagonal system to the wormholelike form depending on the metal loading. The specific surface area varies between 1200 – 600 m 2 g- 1 and the distribution of pores exhibits maxima in diameter 25 – 30 Ε. The remarkable feature of this dissertation is the long range self organized morphology of the solids that contain only transition metal cations. Fascinating particles 1 – 3 μm in dimension decorated by radial folds in the external surface are created mostly in the case of Co. Their shape remind crowns or mushrooms and {{is the result of a}} hierarchical construction. The cations of La or Ce frustrate the patterning of 7 the solids and directing to spherical nanoparticles. Synthesis at 50 oC in the presence of Ni or La plus Ni produces octahedral microcrystals of NiO 0. 5 – 1 μm in dimension that are separated from silicate mesostructure. Porous solids based on CeO 2 have also been synthesized by the use of hexadecylamine as a surfactant. They contain Co or Cu in various atomic ratio Ce:Me. These samples do not exhibit any order mesoporosity. Silica samples that contain Co have been tested in catalytic decomposition of N 2 O. Total conversion of N 2 O is reached at around 600 oC and it is independent of atomic ratiο Si:Co. Ceria plus Co presents higher catalytic activity and N 2 O is totally converted at 500 oC. The samples CeO 2 -Cu have been checked in the catalytic reduction of NO by CO and SO 2 by CO leading to satisfactory results since de-NOx reaction is completed at 250 oC and de-SOx at at 480 oC. Silica samples containing Ni or La-Ni presents high catalytic activity in dry reforming of methane producing synthesis gas (H 2 and CO) which in some cases achieves the ratio H 2 :CO = 0. 95. ...|$|R

The NOx concentration {{in most of the}} EUcities exceeds the EU annual limit value (40 μg/m 3). Around 40 % of the emitted NOx is attributedto transport related emissions. In currently applicable Euro 6, the real NOx emissionfrom a diesel car is on average 400 % than the Euro 6 regulation limit allows ifmeasured under more realistic driving conditions. Although NSR <b>and</b> SCR <b>DeNOx</b> systemshave been broadly investigated and commercially applied with the aim to reduceNOx emissions from lean burn engines,some common problems still exist, e. g., a narrow temperature window and a lowgas hourly space velocity (up to 50. 000 L/L/h) in order to convert the NOx selectivelyinto Nx.

Specifically, the development targets for emissions reduction and fuel injection penalty are given below: (1) NOx conversion efficiency > 90 % (hot), > 84 % (combined); (2) PM conversion efficiency > 90 % (hot), > 84 % (combined); (3) Fuel penalty over FTP- 75 Less than 5 %; and (4) Fuel penalty at Cruise condition Less than 3 %. Development of cost-effective, highly efficient diesel exhaust aftertreatment systems in combination with very low engine out emission combustion development are essential elements for realization of Federal Tier II emission standards for Light Duty Trucks and Vehicles. Evaluation of several aftertreatment technologies was completed {{as part of this}} program. A combination of Diesel Oxidation Catalyst, NOx Adsorbing Catalyst and Catalyzed Soot Filter was found to provide the levels of conversion efficiency required to achieve the emission targets. While early systems required relatively large catalyst volumes, external dosing, sulfur traps, full bypass configurations and high levels of Platinum metals; the final system is a compact, scalable, flow-through, fully-integrated and engine-managed aftertreatment system capable of commercial application for Light Duty Vehicles and Trucks. NOx adsorber/particulate filter technology is particularly attractive for Light Duty applications due to the lower exhaust flow and temperature requirements as compared to Heavy Duty engines. Despite these strong positive aspects, NOx Adsorbers are challenged by their regeneration requirements and susceptibility to sulfur poisoning and thermal degradation. Capability was developed to regenerate the NOx Adsorber for NOx and SOx as well as the Particulate Filter for soot. This system was fully integrated into a truck and evaluated over the chassis dynamometer for emissions capability and in real-world winter field testing. Durability of the system was evaluated over a variety of accelerated and real-time dynamometer tests. Excellent NOx and PM conversion efficiency was demonstrated, even following 3000 hrs of endurance testing. Unregulated emissions emitted by the system were evaluated as was the fuel penalty associated with the <b>DeNOx</b> <b>and</b> <b>DeSOx</b> regeneration processes.

The model parameters are identified following a streamlined approach, focusing on decoupling the effects of <b>deNOx</b> <b>and</b> soot phenomena. Model validation results will be shown demonstrating good model performance for both steady state and transient conditions. Following the validation of the off-line SCRoF model, the model was implemented on a dSPACE platform to demonstrate its real-time capability. The implementation on the dSPACE system is verified by comparing the online model signal outputs to the offline model. Further on, the model is compiled into object code and will be integrated into the ECM. The embedded model is characterized by a low memory footprint and a fast turnaround time...|$|R

30|$|At present, the {{implementation}} of stringent regulations of NOx emission requires {{the development of new}} technologies and improvement of currently used methods for NOx removal from exhaust gas. Effective reduction of NOx emissions from both stationary and mobile sources poses a major challenge. Technologies for the NOx removal can be divided into combustion control and post-combustion treatment. Combustion control aims at reducing the formation of NOx during the combustion of fossil fuel (Adewuyi et al. 1999). Post-combustion control methods include a variety of techniques such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) (Zhang et al. 2015; Jiang et al. 2015), selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) (Lee et al. 2008), thermal <b>DeNOx</b> <b>and</b> scrubbing. SCR can remove NOx with an efficiency of 80 – 95  % and it has been applied in power plants extensively. Up to date, SCR is also considered {{as one of the most}} promising techniques for ocean-going ships. But it requires additional space, high investment and operating cost. Another major concern of SCR is the deleterious effect of SO 2 -laden flue gas on the life of catalyst which is an important factor of this technology’s cost. SNCR approach requires high reaction temperature (900 – 1000  °C) with an elaborate temperature control to avoid ammonia slip and to achieve effective NOx removal. Scrubbing method is one of the advanced air pollution control technologies. It has the ability of removing other acid gases and particulates simultaneously (Makansi 1990).|$|R

Textural and structural features of these catalysts were analyzed {{by means of}} N 2 adsorption and SEM. Their activity in the simultaneous removal of soot and NOx was assayed in a lab-scale installation, using a carbon black as diesel surrogate. Catalysts exhibited significant activity in <b>deNOx</b> <b>and</b> soot oxidation. K and Ba enhanced both NOx adsorption and soot–catalyst contact. However Ba contributed {{to a greater extent}} to the adsorption of N-species, which moreover presented higher thermal stability than on K-catalysts, and K showed higher mobility than Ba Thus, Ba-containing catalysts showed increased activity towards NOx reduction but shifted to higher temperatures in comparison to K-catalysts, which on the other hand resulted more active towards soot oxidation than Ba-ones. Fe-based catalyst turned out to be less active both in soot oxidation and NOx reduction than Co and Cu-based ones. Intensive calcination of the catalysts at 800 C for 5 h resulted in substantial loss of K and Ba. Loss of promoter depends, however, on the metal contained in the catalyst. In this sense Fe-containing catalysts showed higher stability. Calcination has a substantial effect on catalytic activity. Catalyst significantly lost their NOx adsorption capacity and showed similar activity than a catalyst prepared in absence of promoter, pointing to a substantial change in reaction mechanism and reaction predominantly occurring on metallic sites upon the loss of alkali/alkali-earth compound.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 76 - 84). Developing new technologies for the abatement of gaseous nitrogen oxides (NO, NO 2, etc.) {{will still be}} one of the popular research fields; because fossil fuels (mainly coal and natural gas) will remain as the main energy sources for many decades to come. Although various technologies have been developed <b>and</b> implemented for <b>DeNOx</b> processes, alternative approaches are still open to discussion. Among these; Photocatalytic NOx Oxidation-Storage (PhoNOS) can offer promising opportunities to overcome this environmental challenge, as it can be utilized under ambient conditions with the help of UV and visible light irradiation. In this study; firstly, a new performance analysis method was developed other than the photonic efficiencies used in previous works. In this analysis method, a “DeNOx Index” was utilized. This index indicates the net change in total air pollution due to NOx species by comparing the relative contributions of NO and NO 2 along with NO conversion and solid state NOx storage selectivity. This new method was first applied on previously studied TiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 binary oxide samples (P 2) synthesized by sol-gel co-precipitation method in comparison with commercially available Degussa P 25 TiO 2. Furthermore, TiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 (P 2) binary oxides were also physically/mechanically mixed with an alkaline earth oxide, CaO. Addition of CaO to P 2 binary oxides decreased the NO conversion while enhancing the NOx storage. In order to alleviate the loss of NO conversion in CaO+P 2 systems, physical mixtures of P 25 TiO 2 with two different commercial metal oxides (CaO and γ-Al 2 O 3) were prepared and investigated. While CaO provides “higher alkalinity” (i. e. a desirable property for the solid state storage of acidic gaseous NOx species) than γ-Al 2 O 3, mesoporous γ-Al 2 O 3 can provide a higher porosity and specific surface area for the adsorption and storage of the oxidation products in the solid state. Considering these, binary or ternary mixtures with various compositions were prepared and catalytically tested under UV and Visible light irradiation. It was found out that the boosting effect of CaO on NOx storage is more significant than that of γ-Al 2 O 3 for the binary oxides. On the other hand, {{it should be noted that}} ternary mixtures containing smaller amounts of titania with high performance can also be obtained by incorporating alumina into the mixture. In addition to these, performances of selected samples were studied under different humidity conditions and experimental durations. These experiments yielded interesting implications regarding NOx adsorption-oxidation phenomena on the investigated mixed oxide surfaces. Current findings indicate that further experiments are required to fully understand the fundamental mechanisms of photocatalytic NO oxidation and storage at the molecular level. by Mustafa Çağlayan.

No loss in activity was observed in the test span, demonstrating a high stability. We then introduced 20 ppm SO 2 and 10 % H 2 O in the feed, and witnessed a slight drop in activity. But the activity can be readily recovered when cutting off the supply of SO 2 and H 2 O in the feed. The adsorption of NO on the iron oxide surface is a key step in NH 3 -SCR. NO-TPD, NH 3 -TPSR and in situ FTIR results revealed that γ-Fe 2 O 3 nanorods were superior to α-Fe 2 O 3 in adsorbing and activating NO molecules which might account for the high activity.
