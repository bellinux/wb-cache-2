40|$|AbstractThe adobe house {{construction}} {{gives an}} automatic, air conditioning effect because the rooms {{tend to be}} cool at midday and warm at night. Presumably this is {{brought about by the}} walls acting as a <b>heat</b> <b>filter</b> so that there is nearly a 12 -hour phase lag. This raises {{the question of how to}} optimize the adobe phenomenon by a suitable design of the walls. In this study it is supposed possible to make the walls of layered construction with layers having different thermal resistivity. Such a layered wall can be modeled electrically as a ladder filter of capacitors and resistors. The input to the ladder is a sinusoidal voltage. Then the following question arises: If the filter capacitors have given values, how should the resistors be chosen so that the output voltage has a given phase lag but least attenuation? It is found possible to answer this question by use of a special variational principle. Applying this analysis to building construction shows how to maximize oscillation of interior temperature with a phase lag of a prescribed number of hours...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{information}} produced annually is exponential in growth. Currently available magneto-optical materials have reached their storage buffer due to physical limitations imposed by the superparamagnetic effect {{and will not be}} able to meet future storage requirements. The simple fact is that present optical storage technology suffers from an absence of functional organic materials that apply to the next generation of commercially available laser diodes (Nichia blue lasers, 400 - 500 nm). Although 'Blu-Ray' DVD technology has arrived with storage capacities ranging from 27 - 54 GB(operating at 405 nm with 0. 85 NA), the materials are still to be optimised. Higher storage densities of up to 80 GB may be achieved by depositing several layers of a material which is not ideal due to loss of resolution. An ideal material is yet to be realised. In addition, the future will demand a shift to even shorter wavelengths such as UV so that even higher capacities may be managed. Moreover cost is the main area of concern and it is necessary to further develop the materials in this direction. In recent years, a field of research that is growing steadily is that of photo induced phenomenon, in which the incident light itself brings about molecular ordering/ disordering of the liquid- crystalline system. This particular aspect of photonics, in which light can be controlled by light as a stimulus, is being proposed as the future technology for high-speed information processing [1 - 2]. Azobenzene undergoes trans → cis isomerization when irradiated with light tuned to an appropriate wavelength. The reverse cis → trans isomerization can be driven by light or occurs thermally in the dark. Azobenzene's photochromatic properties make it an ideal component of numerous molecular devices and functional materials. Despite the abundance of application-driven research, azobenzene photochemistry and the isomerization mechanism remain topics of investigation[3]. In this report photoisomerization studies were performed on in house prepared anisotropic molecule exhibiting bent core system. It is showing liquid crystalline phases, namely nematic and smectic phase. The photo-switching property of bent core was investigated in chloroform using UV/visible spectroscopy in the absence and in the presence of UV light illumination with 365 nm wavelength passing through <b>heat</b> <b>filter</b> to avoid possible heat raditation which might cause the changes in the system. Compound was illuminated which leads to the E isomer being transformed into the Z isomer. After ∼ 20 s illumination, there is no change in the absorption spectrum which confirms the photosaturation of the E/Z isomerization process, The reverse transformation from Z to E can be brought by two methods, one by keeping the solution in dark and other by shining white light of higher wavelength. The earlier process is well known as thermal back relaxation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract— Superconducting NbN hot {{electron}} bolometer (HEB) mixers {{are so far}} the most sensitive detectors for heterodyne spectroscopy in the frequency range between 1. 5 THz and 5 THz. To reach the ultimate receiver noise temperatures in {{the high end of}} the THz range (3 - 6 THz), it is crucial to understand their fundamental noise contribution from different origins. With increasing frequency, the classical output noise contribution should remain unchanged, but the quantum noise contribution is expected to play an increasing role [1]. This paper reports the first dedicated experiment using a single NbN HEB mixer at a number of local oscillator frequencies between 1. 6 to 4. 3 THz to address and quantify the contribution of the quantum noise to the receiver noise temperature. We used a spiral antenna coupled NbN HEB mixer with a bolometer size of 2 μm× 0. 2 μm. In order to minimize uncertainties in the corrections of the optical losses, we use a vacuum hot/cold load setup [2] to eliminate the air loss, and an uncoated elliptical Si lens. Although other components, a 3 μm Mylar beam splitter and a QMC <b>heat</b> <b>filter,</b> also introduce frequency dependent optical losses, they can be accurately calibrated. Furthermore, to reduce uncertainties in the data, we measure Y-factors responding to the hot/cold load by fixing the voltage, but varying the LO power [2]. As LO, we use a FIR gas laser. We measure the Y-factor at the optimal point at different frequencies by only varying LO frequencies, but keeping the rest exactly the same. We obtain DSB receiver noise temperatures, which are 842 K (at 1. 6 THz), 845 K (1. 9 THz), 974 K (2. 5 THz) and 1372 K (4. 3 THz). After the correction for the losses of the QMC filter and the beam splitter, the noise data show a linear increase with increasing frequency. Using a quantum noise model [1] for HEB mixers and using a criterion for which the classical output noise must be constant at different frequencies, we analyze the results and find the excess quantum noise factor β to be around 2 and that 24 % of the total receiver noise temperature at 4. 3 THz (at the input of the entire receiver) can be ascribed to quantum noise. Clearly the quantum noise has a small but measurable effect on the receiver noise temperature at this frequency. We are still analyzing different alternatives of interpretation for the mismatch loss between the bolometer and the spiral antenna. [1] E. L. Kollberg and K. S.

5000|$|While {{the shows}} {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic had much in common they {{differed}} in two important ways. First, the American shows tended to be larger, with seven operators and over thirty projectors not being exceptional. In contrast, the shows in England seldom had more than three operators and ten or so projectors. Second, American shows were generally built around the overhead projector with the liquids in large clock cover glasses. Shows in England and Europe, in contrast, used modified 2" [...] sq. slide projectors which had their Dichroic <b>heat</b> <b>filters</b> (one or both) removed and employed two layers of slide cover glasses with two liquids (oil and water based, in the early days) between each layer. Alternatively different coloured water based dyes were used in each layer, which slowly boiled producing pulsing vapour bubbles when exposed to the heat of the projector lamp with the <b>heat</b> <b>filters</b> removed. Consequently randomly pulsing and moving blobs of colour were projected on the screen creating the light show. Before the projected layers totally dried out a new slide would be switched in the projector slide holder, meanwhile the old glass would be removed, cleaned and refurbished with new dyes and the projection process would continue. The surface tension of the liquids largely retained the mixtures between the glass slides, but the process was nevertheless very messy indeed and operators had their hands almost permanently stained by the dyes. A popular choice of colored liquids for light shows was Flo-Master ink, a product developed for use in permanent marker pens. While this ink was very vivid it also had the problem of staining the operator's hands very deeply.|$|R

40|$|I have {{developed}} a novel approach to test for toxic organic substances adsorbed onto ultra fine particulate particles present in the ambient air in Northeast Houston, Texas. These particles are predominantly carbon soot with an aerodynamic diameter (AD) of 3 ̆c 2. 5 μm. If present in the ambient air, many of the organic substances will be absorbed {{to the surface of}} the particles (which act just like a charcoal air filter), and may be adducted into the respiratory system. Once imbedded into the lungs these particles may release the adsorbed toxic organic substances with serious health consequences. I used a Airmetrics portable Minivol air sampler time drawing the ambient air through collection filters samples from 6 separate sites in Northeast Houston, an area known for high ambient PM 2. 5 released from chemical plants and other sources (e. g. vehicle emissions). (1) In practice, the mass of the collected particles were much less than the mass of the filters. My technique was designed to release the adsorbed organic substances on the fine carbon particles by <b>heating</b> the <b>filter</b> samples that included the PM 2. 5 particles prior to identification by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS). The results showed negligible amounts of target chemicals from the collection filters. However, the filters alone released organic substances and GCMS could not distinguish between the organic substances released from the soot particles from those released from the <b>heated</b> <b>filter</b> fabric. However, an efficacy tests of my method using two wax burning candles that released soot revealed high levels of benzene. This suggests that my method has the potential to reveal the organic substances adsorbed onto the PM 2. 5 for analysis. In order to achieve this goal, I must refine the particle collection process which would be independent of the filters; the <b>filters</b> upon <b>heating</b> also release organic substances obscuring the contribution from the soot particles. To obtain pure soot particles I will have to filter more air so that the soot particles can be shaken off the filters and then analyzed by my new technique. ...|$|R
