40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to verify levels of tolerance in Anadenanthera colubrina seeds to water and saltstress simulated for polyethyleneglycol 6000 (PEG 6000), manitol and KCl. The seeds was collected from nine treesand stored in cold chamber at 5 ºC. For {{the evaluation of the}} germination under it water stress was used PEG 6000 solutions and manitol, and under salt stress solutions of KCl in different osmotic potentials: 0. 0 Mpa (control), - 0. 6 MPa, - 0. 8 MPa, - 1. 0 MPa, - 1. 2 MPa and - 1. 4 Mpa. The seeds were made use in gerbox and placed in germinationchambers, under constant light to the temperature of 25 ºC. The percentage and the germination speed index (GSI) were evaluated. The seeds of Anadenanthera colubrina showed moderate tolerance to the water stress simulated byPEG 6000. The percentage of germination was affected from - 1. 0 MPa, and the GSI from - 0. 6 Mpa. Manitol did notreveal efficient in the simulation of water stress, therefore it did not reduce the percentage of germination. Under itsalt stress, simulated for KCl, the germination percentage was affected from the potential - 1. 2 MPa, characterizinga <b>high</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> to this salt...|$|E

40|$|Livestock is {{the most}} {{important}} source of income for pastoral livelihoods in drylands. Pastoralists have developed flexible resource utilization strategies that enable them to cope with the high spatio-temporal resource variability typical to these areas. However, climate change in the form of decreasing mean annual precipitation accompanied by increasing variability has important consequences for rangeland productivity and thus pastoral livelihood security. Here, we use a spatial simulation model to assess impacts of changing precipitation regimes, and to identify <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> for these changes beyond which pastoral livelihoods cannot be secured. We also examine strategies to control these limits. Our results indicate that: (i) While reduced mean annual precipitation always had negative effects, increased precipitation variability can have negative, none or even positive effects, depending on the vegetation’s recovery potential. (ii) Depending on income requirements there are <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> to decreases in mean annual precipitation beyond which precipitation regimes overcharge the coping capac-ity of the pastoral household and threaten its livelihood. (iii) There are certain strategies, in particular “Increasing mobility ” and “Diversifying income for coping with income risks from pastoralism”, that al-low the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> to be shifted to a certain extent.

40|$|The {{commonly}} accepted hypothesis {{explaining the}} mechanism of action of pyrazinamide (PZA) {{is based on the}} assumption that PZA-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains produce pyrazinamidase, which hydrolyzes PZA to the antibacterial moiety pyrazinoic acid (POA). It is not clear whether POA has specific antimicrobial activity or the inhibition of growth caused by POA is due to its ability to lower the pH of the environment below the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> M. tuberculosis growth. We confirmed in this study that POA, depending on the concentration, lowered the pH of 7 H 12 broth (pH 6. 0), which ranged from 5. 8 at 120. 0 micrograms/ml to 4. 6 at 960. 0 micrograms/ml. Therefore, we tested the inhibitory effects of different concentrations of POA in broth in which the final pH was adjusted to 5. 6 by adding appropriate amounts of phosphoric acid or dipotassium phosphate. Under these conditions, we found a clear dose-response correlation, proving that POA does have specific antimicrobial activity. The MIC of POA at pH 5. 6 was 240 to 480 micrograms/ml, 8 - to 16 -fold higher than the MIC of PZA under the same conditions and much higher than the concentrations achievable in humans. This suggests that the action of POA in an acid environment is a combined effect of its specific activity and its ability to lower the pH below the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the target organism...|$|R

In this study, we test the hypothesis that the {{addition of}} TIO to FOR may improve respiratory muscle performance and oxygen uptake kinetics after exercise in patients with COPD. MethodsThirty eight patients with COPD were randomized to a 2 week treatment with FOR 12  μg twice a day plus TIO 18  μg once a day (FOR + TIO) or FOR 12  μg twice a day plus placebo (FOR + PLA) once a day, using a double-blind crossover design. Inspiratory muscle. Strength was measured before, immediately after, as well as 2, 5, and 10  min during recovery of exercise. Time to <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> on a constant work load exercise test and oxygen uptake kinetics during recovery were evaluated before and after intervention. ResultsOnly FOR + TIO improved resting (63  ±  10  cm to 84  ±  11 cmH 2 O) and post-exercise (49  ±  7  cm to 84  ±  11 cmH 2 O) maximal inspiratory pressure. Time to <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> on the constant work load test was increased by FOR + PLA and by FOR + TIO, but the size of the increment was significantly larger with FOR + TIO (40. 7  ±  7. 6 % vs. 84. 5  ±  8. 2 %; p <  0. 05). Only FOR + TIO improved oxygen uptake kinetics during recovery (69  ±  21 to 60  ±  18  s). The improvement in maximal inspiratory pressure (0. 78, p <  0. 001) and in oxygen uptake kinetics (− 0. 91, p <  0. 001) correlated with the change in time to the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance.</b> ConclusionsThe addition <b>of</b> TIO to FOR improves inspiratory muscle strength and oxygen uptake kinetics after exercise in COPD patients...|$|R
