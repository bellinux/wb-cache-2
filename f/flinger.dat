40|$|Comminution is {{well known}} to be an inefficient process and a large {{consumer}} of energy globally, giving rise {{to the development of}} novel comminution devices trying to exploit this opportunity. A multi-shaft mill, considered to be a novel comminution device, combines a series of rotating shafts with attached <b>flingers</b> which impact gravity fed material. The mill offers positive benefits in terms of plant footprint, high reduction ratio, high throughput and potential benefits through ore specific circuit integration. A process performance evaluation was conducted by surveying the mill along with using Discrete Element Method (DEM) modelling. The survey proved the mills ability to continuously sustain operation and product size for two different ore types under various configurations. The DEM predicted that gravity fed material entering the multi-shaft mill, with 50 % of particles accelerated to a velocity higher than 184 km/h and 10 % higher than 299 km/h. These velocities are converted to comminution energy through collisions with liners or particle-particle interactions. Each particle is subject to more than 24 impacts per second, greater than the critical breakage strength of a particle (0. 01 kW h/t), leading to potential efficient comminution. Significant numbers of collisions were simulated in the mill alongside significant breakage being recorded through the surveying of the mill, leading to a reasonable comparison of product size distributions from the simulated adsorbed collision energies compared to the survey data. Using this baseline of the mills performance evaluation methodology further simulation work will aim to better quantify the breakage environment through a full-scale simulation run in parallel with future proposed survey work which will address wear rates and tailored operating conditions for specific ore types...|$|R

5000|$|Dr. Nefarious later {{returns as}} the main {{antagonist}} in Ratchet & Clank: A Crack in Time (which is foreshadowed in the ending of Ratchet & Clank Future: Quest for Booty). Having crash-landed on the planet Zanifar and gained {{the trust of the}} local Fongoids, Nefarious explains that as he tried to comprehend how his past plans had always failed, he learned of the Great Clock and devised a plan to use it to alter history so that the villains always defeat the heroes (unaware of the fact that his plan would result in the entire Universe's destruction). Nefarious uses his trust with the Fongoids to have them build a fortress for himself, then summons the creator of the Great Clock, Orvus, to extract information from him regarding the Clock's operation. Though Orvus remains defiant and escapes, Nefarious learns that Clank is the key to accessing the Clock. Two years later (the present day in which the game takes place), Nefarious has moved from his fortress to a large space station designed in the image of his head and is terrorizing the Polaris Galaxy with aid from Lord Vorselon and the Valkyries. His plans to harness the Great Clock have not abated, and he orders Lawrence to observe Clank in secret from within the Clock. After Clank opens the Orvus Chamber, Lawrence knocks him out and reports the news to Nefarious. The doctor then gleefully starts [...] "Unnecessarily Evil Initiative Omega-91" [...] by using Clank as bait to lure Ratchet into a Valkyrie ambush. With [...] "help" [...] from Captain Qwark, Ratchet and Clank infiltrate Nefarious's space station and destroy his fleet of ships, but are captured and brought before Nefarious. After explaining the full extent of his plans, Nefarious ejects the two heroes with his [...] "Asteroid <b>Flinger</b> 5000" [...] (installed in the case that he needs an ironic death scenario for his enemies). After surviving a crash landing on planet Morklon and going back in time to help the Fongoids win the Battle of Gimlick Valley, Ratchet and Clank commandeer a ship back to the space station and stop Nefarious from boarding his last remaining ship to the Great Clock. In the end, Dr. Nefarious is again defeated by Ratchet and Clank and falls screaming to his ship's surface. Upon landing, he suffers a complete system breakdown (characterized by random music signals and dancing) before his ship crashes into the space station and destroys it. Though Ratchet and Clank escape in time with aid from Azimuth, it is reported during the credits that Nefarious's body was not found in the wreckage. In the Ratchet & Clank comic series and All 4 One, Qwark confirms that Lawrence teleported Nefarious away in time and that he is still considered to be within the Polaris System. Doctor Nefarious is a playable character in the game Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One, where he initially triggers the plot by tricking Qwark into fighting a giant Light-eating Z'Grute only to be attacked by his own creature. When Ratchet and Clank try to stop it, they, Qwark, and Nefarious are all captured by the Creature Collector Ephemeris, and the villainous robot is forced to work with the heroes to escape. Despite his dislike of his [...] "partners", Nefarious slowly warms up to playing the hero, even {{going so far as to}} save Qwark on a few occasions. In the end, Nefarious reasserts his supervillain attitude and escapes, though a final scene hints that he may not have been completely ungrateful for his temporary friends. Nefarious appears as an downloadable skin in Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault. Outside of the Ratchet and Clank series, Nefarious cameos in the San Francisco level of PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, and was originally planned as a playable character in the game alongside Ratchet and Clank. Nefarious also appeared as an unlockable Chibi-sized Minion in a patch for the game.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Amongst {{different}} habitats, fire is {{an ecological}} factor and determinant that affects many physico-chemical soil factors. In addition, among natural disturbances, fire {{plays an important}} role in plant diversity conservation and in some areas around the world, the presence of some plant species depends on natural fire. The extension of fire influences on soil is related to the fire severity. In fact, fire severity encompasses of two characteristics: extension and time of burning. On the other hand, fire extension and burning time are affected by humidity, air temperature, wind speed, topographical characteristics. Despite high frequency of fire in natural habitats and high level of fire effectiveness on soil parameters, study of fire impacts on soil characteristics were rarely reported in Iran. In addition, most previous studies were conducted in forest habitats, ignoring the severity of fire on soil. Materials and Methods: In order to investigate the effect of fire severity on some soil physico-chemical characteristics, Yeylagh Dasht area (rangeland habitats) was selected in southern-east of national Golestan Park with three different plant covers, viz. grass, shrub and cushion. Many fires occurring have been reported in this park in each year. For the current study, we tried to select the habitats in which the fire was occurred at least one year before. A control area without burning with similar ecological parameters was also selected adjacent to the burnt area. in fact unburnt area was isolated by a road from burnt area, unable to extend the fire into unburnt area due to the road. Fire had been occurred in the burnt area in September, 2014. Soil samples with 15 replications in burnt area and 15 replications in unburnt were collected within a depth of 0 - 5 cm and then transported to the soil laboratory to measure some qualitative soil characteristics i. e. soil organic matter (SOM), particulate organic matter (POM), total nitrogen (TN) and aggregate stability (AS). All statistical analyses were done by R software. Before ANOVAs (one and two-ways) and unpaired t-test, we tested data for normal distribution by Shapiro-Wilk test and homogeneity of variance by <b>Flinger</b> Test. Results and Discussion: The results of two-way ANOVA showed that the main effect of fire on soil was not significant while the main effect of fire severity and the interaction of fire and fire severity on SOM and POM were significant (Table 1). The results of one-way ANOVA showed that the content of SOM was significantly different between three different treatments in unburnt area (control area) while there were no significant differences between the three treatments (three fire severities) in burning areas. Therefore it can be discussed that the kind of vegetation (grassland, shrub or cushion) could affect SOM while the fire increased the spatial homogeneity of SOM. The same pattern of SOM was occurred for POM in burnt and unburnt areas. However, the results of unpaired t-test showed that POM was drastically decreased after high and intermediate fire severities. Aggregate stability and POM were significantly decreased in the intermediate and high severities of fire (cushion and shrub plant cover). Fire in the intermediate and high severities increased TN (Figure 1). We concluded that fire occurring by plants might be decreased POM and AS significantly. In addition, mineralization probable increased TN after burning. We also compared soil characteristics among three fire severities in burnt area and in unburnt area separately. Conclusion: This study showed that the variation of soil characteristic was mainly affected by different fire severities. Therefore, we emphasized that fire severity should be considered in the studies of the impact of fire on soil in different habitats. Fire can decrease the spatial heterogeneity of soil parameters among different sites. We showed that soil POM is a characteristic more sensitive than total SOM in confronting with fire...|$|E
30|$|The {{residue fluid}} {{catalytic}} cracking unit (RFCCU) of Khartoum Refinery Company (KRC) uses conradson carbon residue and metal-contaminated feedstocks (such as atmospheric residue or mixtures of vacuum residue and gas oils) to produce more valuable products (especially gasoline) using active zeolite catalyst in a circulating fluidized bed [1]. In the RFCCU, the oil feed and dispersion steam enter the catalytic riser reactor together with the regenerated catalyst, where cracking of vacuum residue into lighter hydrocarbons starts as it contacts the hot regenerated catalyst from the regenerator. The regenerated catalyst is made to rise by steam introduced {{at the base of}} the riser reactor between the regenerator and the feed inlet point. The vaporized feed and the catalyst pass through the riser reactor into disengager for cracked products and catalyst separation. During the cracking process, coke is deposited on the catalyst, and the spent catalyst flows down by gravity into the regenerator, where air is used to burn off the coke deposited on the catalyst in a combustion environment so that it is returned to a stable state for catalysing the cracking reaction. The hot regenerated catalyst is then re-injected into the base of the riser reactor [2]. The complexity of the typical FCCU feed makes it extremely difficult to characterize and describe the inherent kinetics at a molecular level. In this way, similar components are grouped into lumps. Therefore, lumping scheme has been used to study the reactions involved in the catalytic cracking of heavy oil. To give an insight into a comprehensive prediction of products’ distribution, there is an increasing number of lumps of the proposed models for catalytic cracking reactions [3]. In the first kinetic model of Weekman [4, 5] for catalytic cracking of heavy oil, three lumps were identified as gas oil (feedstock), gasoline, and light gas[*]+[*]coke as products, without incorporating diffusion characteristics of solid and gas phases. Lee et al. [6, 7] modified the three-lump model by splitting the light gas[*]+[*]coke lump into two different lumps of C 1 –C 4 gas and coke; therefore, resulting in the four-lump model for catalytic cracking of heavy oil. Corella and Frances [8] developed a five-lump model, in which the gas oil lump was divided into its heavy and light fractions. Different modified versions of five-lump model were developed by Dupain et al. [9], Kraemer et al. [10], and Ancheyta et al. [11]. Other proposed kinetic models for catalytic cracking of heavy oil include: 6 -lump [1, 12, 13, 14, 15], 8 -lump [16], 10 -lump [17, 18], 11 -lump [19], 13 -lump [20], 14 -lump [21], and 19 -lump [22], without taking cognisance of diffusion resistance. A comprehensive review was presented by Pinheiro et al. [23] on the subject of {{fluid catalytic cracking}} process modelling, simulation, and control. Obviously, the number of lumps of the proposed kinetic models for catalytic cracking of heavy oil may be increased to obtain more detailed descriptions of the catalytic cracking reactions and product distribution [24, 25]. However, sparing kinetic investigations have been carried out with the incorporation of diffusion resistances. Taking into account mass and heat transfer resistances between the reacting fluid and solid phases helps with conceiving the lump concentration on the catalyst surface as well as temperature profiles of the fluid and solid phases. <b>Flinger</b> et al. [26] considered mass transfer between the fluid and solid phases in the FCCU-riser reactor model equation. Gupta and Subba Rao [27] and Nayak et al. [28] applied the relationship for Sherwood number proposed by Ranz and Marshall [29] in their model to demonstrate the effects of mass transfer. The lump concentration within the catalyst is reduced by intraparticle mass transfer. In this way, the presence of an internal concentration gradient reduces the average rate of cracking [30]. Pruski et al. [31] validated adsorption coefficients for the four-lump model of catalytic cracking of gas oil. Bidabehere and Sedran [32] set up a model to investigate the impacts of diffusion, adsorption, and reaction at high temperature inside commercial FCC catalyst pellets and analysed the significance of these phenomenon. Dupain et al. [9] discussed external and internal mass transfer relationships utilised for FCC riser.|$|E
