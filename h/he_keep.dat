5|$|Gaius instructs Merlin {{to deliver}} elixirs to Morgana and Lady Helen; in the latter's room {{he finds the}} poppet, but bluffs {{his way out of}} discovery. Later, Helen kills a handmaiden who glimpses her true form in a mirror. At the feast, Mary sings an enchantment as Lady Helen, causing all the guests to fall asleep. Merlin, {{realising}} what is going on, covers his ears. Mary attempts to kill Arthur, but Merlin drops a chandelier on her with magic before she releases the dagger. As she has stopped singing, the enchantment is lifted and her true appearance is revealed. In a last effort she throws the dagger at Arthur, but Merlin slows time to pull him out of the way. Mary dies from her injuries, having failed in her attempt to avenge her son. Uther rewards Merlin by making him Arthur's servant, though neither boy is thrilled with the idea. The next day, Gaius gives Merlin a book on magic, under condition that <b>he</b> <b>keep</b> it hidden.|$|E

50|$|The {{strategy}} {{is complicated by}} the fact that, because of the Joker rule, the player will score 30 if he gets a Yahtzee. Clearly <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> any Small Straight or Yahtzee that he throws. After the first throw <b>he</b> will <b>keep</b> a run of 3 or 3 out of 4 (e.g. 124) if he has one. Otherwise <b>he</b> will <b>keep</b> a 3 or 4 (or both) and a 2 or 5 if he also has a 3 or 4 (e.g. with 11245 <b>he</b> will <b>keep</b> 24 but with 11255 <b>he</b> will <b>keep</b> nothing).He will not keep just 2, 5 or 25. The only difference after the second throw is that <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> 1111, 2222, 5555 and 6666 and will try to throw a Yahtzee unless the other die is a 3 or 4.|$|R

5|$|Hank Mitchell and {{his wife}} Sarah live in rural Minnesota. One of the town's few college graduates, Hank works in a feed mill, while his wife is a librarian. When Hank, his older, {{socially}} challenged brother Jacob and Jacob's friend Lou chase a fox into the woods, they stumble upon a crashed airplane. Hank decides to look inside the plane where he discovers a dead pilot and a bag containing $4.4 million in $100 bills. He suggests turning the money in but is persuaded not to by Jacob and Lou. Hank then proposes that <b>he</b> <b>keep</b> the money safe at his house {{until the end of}} winter. Sheriff Carl Jenkins drives by the area and notices the three men after they hide the money in Jacob's pick-up truck. Jacob mentions hearing a plane in the area to avoid suspicion. After Carl leaves, the three men decide to keep the money a secret, but Hank breaks the pact when he reveals the discovery to Sarah.|$|E

With War Cabinet opinion having turned against Lloyd George – who was also rebuked by the King – Robertson also then submitted a memorandum stating that the Calais Agreement was not to be a permanent arrangement, along with a “personal statement” so critical of Lloyd George that he refused to have it included in the minutes.|$|E
25|$|Furtwängler resumed conducting. On April 25, 1935, he {{returned}} to the Berlin Philharmonic with a program dedicated to Beethoven. Many people who had boycotted the orchestra during his absence came to the concert to support him. He was called out seventeen times. On May 3, in his dressing room before conducting the same program, he was informed that Hitler and his entire staff would attend the concert. He was given the order to welcome Hitler with the Nazi salute. Furtwängler was so furious that he ripped the wooden panelling off a radiator. Franz Jastrau, the manager of the orchestra, suggested that <b>he</b> <b>keep</b> his baton in his right hand all the time. When he entered the hall, all the Nazi leaders were present making the Hitler salute, but Furtwängler kept hold of his baton and began the concert immediately. Hitler probably could not have imagined that such an affront was possible but decided to put up a good show: he sat down and the concert went on.|$|E
25|$|Three major rebellions led by Rentap (1853), Liu Shan Bang (1857) and Syarif Masahor (1860) {{shook the}} Rajah's {{administration}} which, {{together with the}} stagnant economic conditions at the time, caused Brooke to be plagued by debt. he was driven into planning to cede his kingdom to the British to settling his debt; while the idea was supported by some of Britain's member of parliaments (MPs) and businessmen, it was rejected by Prime Minister Lord Derby who feared that {{the introduction of a}} British taxation system would shock the population more than exercising their own system under the Rajahs. Brooke then thought to sell his kingdom to Belgium, France, Russia or to Brunei again or also to other European powers rather than to the neighbouring Dutch who were ready to retake his kingdom. Brooke's intention had already been disliked by neighbouring British Governors such as Labuan Governor Hennessy, who had expressed his feeling that although <b>he</b> <b>keep</b> a high respect towards the Rajah he considered the kingdom as only a vassal state of Brunei as its status for being independent from the British could be sold by Brooke or turn to be a protectorate of other European nations by the owner wish.|$|E

500|$|Michael's {{attention}} {{turned to}} Alexandra Kossikovskaya (September 1875, Orel region – 1923, Berlin), known affectionately as [...] "Dina", {{who was his}} sister Olga's lady-in-waiting. Dina's father, Vladimir Kossikovsky, was a lawyer and Dina was a commoner. Michael rejected the notion, proposed by his friends, that <b>he</b> <b>keep</b> her as a mistress, and in July 1906 he wrote to Nicholas asking permission to marry her. Nicholas and Dowager Empress Marie were appalled. Both felt that royalty should marry royalty and, according to Russian house law, any children of a marriage between a royal and a commoner would be ineligible for the succession. Nicholas threatened to revoke Michael's army commission and exile him from Russia if he married without his permission. Marie had Dina dismissed as Olga's lady-in-waiting and took Michael to Denmark until mid-September.|$|E

She requested that <b>he</b> <b>keep</b> Kaycee's identity secret. Van der Woning did as requested and kept the information to himself; however, this had the side effect of allowing the Metafilter investigation to continue. As more and more evidence mounted {{that the story of}} Kaycee had been cobbled together using misdirection and borrowed facts, Swenson emailed the truth to him, and he, in turn, posted it to the In Living Colours blog on May 20: Kaycee Nicole had never existed. [...] "I didn't know the reactions would be so strong", Swenson said. [...] "I knew it was wrong and every day it ate at me and I couldn't take it." [...] She now claimed that Kaycee was a composite of three people she had known with cancer, none of whom were her daughter.|$|E

2500|$|Ohno {{would later}} confess {{that he had}} subconsciously held back for fear of {{suddenly}} crashing into Davis or Smith, a common occurrence in the sport, pointing out {{that he did not}} need to win the race because he already had a spot on the team. Questions persisted that if Ohno had really held back, why did <b>he</b> <b>keep</b> passing Biondo? [...] Some speculated that Ohno was holding off Biondo from challenging Smith, as Smith also needed to finish ahead of Biondo in order to secure a spot in the 1000 m for Salt Lake. Even this scenario would have been a violation of the rules of team skating. Both claims went unproven in the arbitration case, and all three were absolved of guilt.|$|E

[...] In another account of Helmsley's behavior, she had a {{barbecue}} pit constructed for her home. The work was performed by Eugene Brennan, a personal friend of Jeremiah McCarthy, the chief engineer of Helmsley-Spear. When the final bill came to $13,000, she refused to pay, citing shoddy workmanship. When McCarthy pleaded with her to honor the bill, citing the favor done on his behalf and informing her that Brennan had six children to support, Helmsley replied, [...] "Why didn't <b>he</b> <b>keep</b> his pants on?

2500|$|The Speaker begins Sonnet 4 (quatrain 1) {{by asking}} his male friend why he must waste his beauty on himself, because nature doesn’t give people gifts besides {{the ones we}} get at birth. However, nature does lend {{to those who are}} generous with their own beauty. The second quatrain is about the speaker asking a friend, the subject of the poem, why he abuses the {{plentiful}} and generous gifts he was given, which are meant to be shared with others. Then the speaker goes on to ask why he vows to be a bad shareholder, using up what he has to offer but not able to care for himself or reserve his own money. One literary piece sums this up as the [...] "idea of miser versus money-lender". This is questioning whether or not he should loan money. [...] Should he be a lender or should <b>he</b> <b>keep</b> from giving his money away, coming off as a miser. In quatrain 3, the speaker is trying to persuade his male friend to have children because he says that not doing so would be a waste of the man’s beauty. The speaker says that {{there is no reason why}} his friend should remain alone and let his beauty die off with him. Joseph Pequigney said that Shakespeare's sonnets have [...] "erotic attachment and sexual involvement with the fair young man with whom all of sonnets 1-126 are concerned". Sonnet 4 clearly is a part of this group and does indeed have some references that can be taken as emotional descriptions. The couplet suggests that the young man has valuable attraction that is not being used properly or appreciated.|$|E
2500|$|Yet {{it would}} be a mistake to {{conclude}} that Ivar was nothing but a crook. Reality was more nuanced. For one thing disclosure rules in his days were much less stringent. Many corporations refused to reveal details for fear competitors would gain an advantage. (At least that was the claim often made.) [...] Some firms did not even publish quarterly results. Ivar, too, was very secretive and not only with investors. When he was on the verge of hiring somebody he usually asked: [...] "Can <b>he</b> <b>keep</b> a secret?" [...] He was also very fond of quoting his motto for success: [...] "Silence, more silence, and still more silence." [...] Also one cannot fault him for the speculative fever in the 1920s. Without the hunger for ever larger profits many of Ivar's schemes would not have been possible. Incidentally this facilitated a transfer of capital from the USA to Europe where it was, often desperately, needed. He sold shares in the USA worth 250 million dollars (equivalent to c. 3.75 billion today) and transferred almost all of it to his holding company in Liechtenstein, Continental Investment Corporation. Shareholders of International Match had given him authority to do this so there was nothing wrong with it. There was also a tax advantage because of the advantageous deal he had negotiated with Liechtenstein. But Ivar did it above all to have the flexibility to manipulate balance sheets and financial statements so they would look more attractive to investors as well as helping him – to some extent - pay the high dividends of Swedish Match and Kreuger & Toll. He got the nickname [...] "Saviour of Europe" [...] by lending about $400 million (equivalent to c. $6 billion today) to rebuild their shattered economies after World War I. He invented new financial instruments to help him raise funds and, of course, make him money. Indeed, many consider Ivar to be the father of modern financial schemes. Oscar Rydbeck, his Swedish banker, said Ivar was the third richest man in the world. He, however, claimed [...] "money as such means nothing to me". Ivar was also a successful speculator for much of his life making lots of money until shortly before the end. Trying to support the collapsing share prices of many of his companies (including ways which were—if not illegal—questionable, e.g. using straw men for share transactions. In the case of his acquisition of Diamond Match shares it was clearly illegal because of anti-trust laws.) ...|$|E
