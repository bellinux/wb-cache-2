50|$|A fish ladder, {{also known}} as a fishway, fish pass or <b>fish</b> <b>steps,</b> is a {{structure}} on or around artificial and natural barriers (such as dams, locks and waterfalls) to facilitate diadromous fishes' natural migration. Most fishways enable fish to pass around the barriers by swimming and leaping up a series of relatively low steps (hence the term ladder) into the waters on the other side. The velocity of water falling over the steps has to be great enough to attract the fish to the ladder, but it cannot be so great that it washes fish back downstream or exhausts them to the point of inability to continue their journey upriver.|$|E

40|$|Eigenmannia virescens is a South American {{freshwater}} {{species with}} an electric organ discharge (EOD) of the wave type. This social fish's EOD is masked by the intense noise from close-by conspecifics. In spite of this, Eigenmannia detects external signals at lowest thresholds for a vertebrate octavolateralis sensory system; furthermore, Eigenmannia discriminates between stimulus waveforms which is unknown for mechanical sensory modalities. It is suggested that an analysis of beat signals in three steps underlies these sensory feats: (1) stimulus filtering and intensity assessment of a single harmonic of an external signal, in spite of only weak tuning of the high-frequency part of the electrosensory system. (2) Assessment of the frequency difference between a fish's own EOD and that of an external signal. It is shown that temporal cues of the mixed (beat) signal are sufficient, and that beat amplitude cues are not required; nor do {{they seem to be}} used by the <b>fish.</b> <b>Steps</b> 1 and 2 completed, a fish may change its EOD frequency (e. g., by a jamming avoidance response) for optimizing (3) the assessment of stimulus waveform from the beat signal, such as external female and male EODs.

Regional agricultural water resource system features with unpredictable, self-organization, and non-linear which lays a certain difficulty on the evaluation of regional agriculture water resource resilience. The current research on water resource resilience remains to focus on qualitative analysis and the quantitative analysis {{is still in the}} primary stage, thus, according to the above issues, projection pursuit classification model is brought forward.

Taking Hongxinglong Administration of Heilongjiang as the research base and on the basis of improving AFSA, it established the evaluation of projection pursuit classification model to agriculture water resource system resilience besides the proceeding analysis of projection pursuit classification model on accelerating genetic algorithm.

However, {{there are certain}} defects of the traditional evaluation method, which can easily generate problems including evaluation grading discretion, unreasonable results and subjective information factor missing (Fu 2006). Projection pursuit classification model (PPC) {{is a kind of}} statistics for high-dimensional data processing and analysis and its main thought is to project the high-dimensional data to low-dimensional space and reflect projection value of high-dimensional data structure or feature by low-dimensional space. Actually projection pursuit classification model is a dimensional reduction technology, with optimizing projection index function and finding optimal projection value as its core problem. The previous research optimized the projection index function through utilizing real-coded accelerating genetic algorithm (Zhao et al. 2007), particle swarm algorithm (Jiang et al. 2011), immune evolutionary algorithm (Shu et al. 2004), and simulated genetic returns algorithm (Xie et al. 2005) which were uncertain and easy to be caught in partial optima thus to cause unreasonable and unreliable calculating result. This paper tries to apply for AFSA to optimize projection pursuit, introducing self-adaptive artificial <b>fish</b> <b>step</b> and crowding factor to improve AFSA and overcome the defect of being caught in partial optima. Taking Hongxinglong Administration as the research base, it applies for projection pursuit classification model on adaptive artificial fish-swarm algorithm (AAFSA–PPC) to evaluate the resilience of regional agricultural water resource system, and thus to provide a scientific and reasonable research mode for water resource system resilience research.|$|R

Next, it also aims at finding on the allowed fishing so that it can maintain the fish biomass stick in a balanced condition. The method used in this study is sceafer to predict a certain fish biomass stock in a fishing area. The analysis used is linear regression to find out how much is the optimum fishing, how much the use percentage and how much is the maximum sustainable yield, and the allowed fishing as well. The result of the study show that the optimum fishing is about 1215 (unit/year), the sustainable fishing to maintain the biomass stock is about 21. 865 tons per year in which it is placed in its balanced condition, and the use percentage is about 228 or it is up to 148 from the actual rate and the allowed fishing is about 17. 492 in each year.

40|$|AIMS: Fluorescence in situ {{hybridization}} (FISH) {{has been}} proposed for species-specific detection, and viability determination of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. FISH-based viability determination depends on rRNA decay after loss of viability. We {{examined the effects of}} RNase(s) and RNase inhibitors on FISH of C. parvum. METHODS AND RESULTS: FISH was performed using a 5 '-Texas red-labelled DNA oligonucleotide probe at 1 pM microl(- 1). Intact and heat-permeabilized oocysts were treated with 1 - 100 microg ml(- 1) RNase. FISH of intact oocysts appeared unaffected by exogenous RNase if this was neutralized before permeabilization. FISH fluorescence of heat-killed oocysts stored in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature decayed by 1 / 2 after 55 h, but remained detectable after 6 days. Addition of vanadyl ribonucleoside complex (VRC) extended rRNA half-life of heat-permeabilized oocysts to 155 h. CONCLUSIONS: Extended rRNA half-life may result in viability overestimation using FISH. RNase pretreatment before FISH is recommended to destroy residual rRNA in recently killed oocysts. Incorporation of 1 - 10 mM l(- 1) VRC before <b>FISH</b> permeabilization <b>steps</b> should neutralize RNase activity.

40|$|Locating {{appropriate}} settlement {{habitat is}} a crucial step in {{the life cycle of}} most benthic marine animals. In marine <b>fish,</b> this <b>step</b> involves the use of multiple senses, including audition, olfaction and vision. To date, most investigations of larval fish audition focus on the hearing thresholds to various frequencies of sounds without testing an ecological response to such sounds. Identifying responses to biologically relevant sounds at the development stage in which orientation is most relevant is fundamental. We tested for the existence of ontogenetic windows of reception to sounds that could act as orientation cues with a focus on vulnerability to alteration by human impacts. Here we show that larvae of a catadromous fish species (barramundi, Lates calcarifer) were attracted towards sounds from settlement habitat during a surprisingly short ontogenetic window of approximately 3 days. Yet, this auditory preference was reversed in larvae reared under end-of-century levels of elevated CO 2, such that larvae are repelled from cues of settlement habitat. These future conditions also reduced the swimming speeds and heightened the anxiety levels of barramundi. Unexpectedly, an acceleration of development and onset of metamorphosis caused by elevated CO 2 were not accompanied by the earlier onset of attraction towards habitat sounds. This mismatch between ontogenetic development and the timing of orientation behaviour may reduce the ability of larvae to locate habitat or lead to settlement in unsuitable habitats. The misinterpretation of key orientation cues can have implications for population replenishment, which are only exacerbated when ontogenetic development decouples from the specific behaviours required for location of settlement habitats...|$|R
