5|$|In 2000, David Martill et al. {{announced}} {{the preservation of}} soft tissue in a specimen referred to a cf. Scelidosaurus sp., that is, an unnamed species for which a comparison with Scelidosaurus can be illuminating. The fossil, with <b>inventory</b> <b>number</b> BRSMG CF2781, {{was in the early}} 1990s, in an already prepared state, discovered in the legacy of the late Professor John Challinor, which had used it to illustrate his lectures with. Its provenance is unknown. It consists of a series of eight caudal vertebrae in a cut slab of carbonate mudstone, which was judged to date from the late Hettangian to Sinemurian stages. Parts of the fossil were preserved {{in such a way that}} an envelope of preserved soft tissue is visible around the vertebrae, and show the presence of an epidermal layer over the scutes. The authors concluded that the osteoderms of all basal armoured dinosaurs were covered in a tough, probably keratinous layer of skin.|$|E

5|$|The first small bones {{belonging}} to Balaur bondoc consisted of six {{elements of the}} front limbs. Named specimens FGGUB R. 1580–1585, these were discovered in 1997 in Romania by Dan Grigorescu, but the morphology of the arm was so unusual that scientists could not correctly combine them, mistaking them for the remains of an oviraptorosaur. The first partial skeleton was discovered in September 2009 in Romania, approximately 2.5 kilometers north of Sebeș, along the Sebeș river in the Sebeș Formation dating from the early Maastrichtian, and was given the preliminary field number SbG/A-Sk1. Later it received the holotype <b>inventory</b> <b>number</b> EME VP.313.

25|$|In 1811, in Lyme Regis, along what is {{now called}} the Jurassic Coast of Dorset, the first {{complete}} ichthyosaur skull was found by Joseph Anning, the brother of Mary Anning, who in 1812 while still a young girl, secured the torso of the same specimen. Their mother, Molly Anning, sold the combined piece to squire Henry Henley for £23. Henley lent the fossil to the London Museum of Natural History of William Bullock. When this museum was closed, the British Museum bought the fossil for a price of £47.5s; it still belongs to the collection of the now independent Natural History Museum and has the <b>inventory</b> <b>number</b> BMNH R.1158.

25|$|The only {{three-dimensional}} {{depiction of}} Khufu that has survived time nearly completely {{is a small}} and well restored ivory figurine known as Khufu Statuette. It shows the king with the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. The king is seated on a throne with a short backrest, at {{the left side of}} his knees the Horus-name Medjedu is preserved, and, at the right side, the very scarce rest of the lower part of the cartouche name Khnum-Khuf is visible. Khufu holds a flail in his left hand, and his right hand rests together with the lower arm on his right upper leg. The artifact was found in 1903 by Flinders Petrie at Kom el-Sultan near Abydos. The figurine was found headless; according to Petrie, it was caused by an accident while digging. When Petrie recognized the importance of the find, he stopped all other work and offered a reward to any workman who could find the head. Three weeks later the head was found after intense sifting in a deeper level of the room rubble. Today the little statue is restored and on display in the Egyptian Museum of Cairo in room 32 under its <b>inventory</b> <b>number</b> JE 36143. Most Egyptologists believe the statuette is contemporary, but some scholars, such as Zahi Hawass, think that it was an artistic reproduction of the 26th dynasty. He argues that no building that surely dates to the 4th dynasty was ever excavated at Kom el-Sultan or Abydos. Furthermore, he points out that the face of Khufu is unusually squat and chubby and shows no emotional expression. Hawass compared the facial stylistics with statues of contemporary kings, such as Sneferu, Khaefra and Menkaura. The faces of these three kings are of even beauty, slender and with a kindly expression – the clear result of idealistic motivations; they are not based on reality. The appearance of Khufu on the ivory statue instead looks like the artist did not care very much about professionalism or diligence. And Khufu himself would have never allowed the display of such a comparatively sloppy work. And finally, Hawass also argues that the sort of throne the figurine sits on does not match the artistic styles of any Old Kingdom artifact. Old Kingdom thrones had a backrest that reached up to the neck of a king. But the ultimate proof that convinces Hawass about the statue being a reproduction of much later time is the Nehenekh-flail in Khufu's left hand. Depictions of a king with such a flail as a ceremonial insignia appear no earlier than during the Middle Kingdom. Zahi Hawass therefore concludes that the figurine was possibly made as an amulet or lucky charm to sell to pious citizens.|$|E

40|$|What is the {{hog cycle}}? In theory, the hog cycle is {{four years in}} length. It is the {{interaction}} of the pig inventory, hog slaughter, and hog price. As the pig <b>inventory</b> grows, the <b>number</b> of hogs slaughtered increases and the price decreases. As the profitability decreases, marketing more sows and not keeping as many replacement gilts reduces the breeding herd. This creates a further increase in slaughter numbers. The graph below provides an example using United States (U. S.) data from January 1998 to December 2001 on a quarterly basis. With the profitability in the industry in 1996 and 1997, the inventory of pigs started to increase and it peaked {{in the third quarter of}} 1998. The number of pigs slaughtered increased during 1998, peaking in the fourth quarter, resulting in the low price for the cycle. The U. S. breeding herd continued to decrease for eight quarters. Slaughter decreased on a year over year basis. Because of the decreasing slaughter and inventory, prices returned to profitable levels in 2000 and 2001. Again, slaughter and <b>inventory</b> <b>numbers</b> began to creep up in 2001. This led to another price cycle low in the fall of 2002. The various components that influence the hog market cycles are constantly changing and interacting. What about the interaction of price, <b>inventory</b> <b>numbers</b> and slaughter volume for both the United States and Canada? The graph below provides a picture of the relative percentage changes from one year to the next of these three items using the combined <b>inventory</b> <b>numbers</b> and slaughter volumes for United State...|$|R

500|$|A travelogue {{issued in}} Yugoslavia in the 1920s {{described}} the triptych as showing the [...] "solidarity of several nations", {{an example of}} the Banat's diversity and cosmopolitanism. [...] "Great artists are never narrow-minded or chauvinists", it continued, [...] "and Jovanović's paintings are a nice example of this". The triptych endures in popularity because it shows Vojvodina's past diversity and cosmopolitanism, which declined significantly during and after World War II, and the subsequent expulsion of the region's ethnic German population. This led one observer to remark on the irony of the triptych celebrating diversity and coexistence in Vršac though descendants of the Germans depicted in the painting are unlikely to be living there today. Nevertheless, the town still has a sizable population of Romanians and Hungarians, according to the 2011 Serbian census. In 1896, the triptych was gifted to the Vršac City Museum by the artist, where it remains on display. It is catalogued under <b>inventory</b> <b>number</b> 168.|$|E

The objects were soon discovered to be too heavy for the floors of Montagu House (the original building of The British Museum), and they were transferred to a new extension that was built onto the mansion. The Rosetta Stone was transferred to the sculpture gallery in 1834 shortly after Montagu House was demolished and replaced by the building that now houses the British Museum.
