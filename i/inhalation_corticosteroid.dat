40|$|Childhood asthma is {{a common}} chronic disease, {{featured}} by inflammation of the airways and episodic bronchoconstriction. Exercise is an important trigger for bronchoconstriction in asthmatic children. They experience this symptom, limiting participation in play and sports, as the most bothersome aspect of their asthma. Symptoms of exercise induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) can be subtle and stay unrecognized by caregivers and parents, compromising social and motor development. Asthmatic children may adapt to their exercise limitations and avoid symptoms. An exercise challenge test (ECT), especially in cold dry air, can objectify asthmatic symptoms {{and can be used}} for diagnosing and monitoring asthma. A cornerstone in asthma treatment is inhalation medication. In this thesis we investigated various aspects of inhalation therapy in childhood asthma with the aim of optimizing this therapy. This thesis investigated factors contributing to maintenance medication adherence, the influence of the body posture during medication inhalation and the optimalization of inhalation technique. Also we analyzed the protective effect of a single regular dose of <b>inhalation</b> <b>corticosteroid</b> against exercise induced bronchoconstriction, the protective effect of salbutamol against exercise induced inspiratory flow limitation and the correlation between the difference in mannitol responsiveness between baseline and after a single dose of <b>inhalation</b> <b>corticosteroid</b> and the difference in mannitol responsiveness between baseline and after four weeks of <b>inhalation</b> <b>corticosteroid</b> treatment {{which turned out to be}} highly correlated. This means change in mannitol responsiveness after a single dose of <b>inhalation</b> <b>corticosteroid</b> could provide objective information predicting the effectiveness of long term regular treatment...|$|E
40|$|In {{context of}} the {{development}} of evidence-based guidelines by the Dutch Paediatric Society, the three most important controversies in asthma treatment in children were investigated by systematic literature review and assessed based on the quality of evidence according to GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). Although the quality of evidence was low, this method did result in clear, although weak, recommendations, in which the considerations playing a role are made clear. In young children with severe and/or recurrent wheezing, maintenance treatment using an <b>inhalation</b> <b>corticosteroid</b> (ICS) is initially recommended. When inhalation technique is poor, a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) can be given instead. Inhalation corticosteroids with ultrafine particles are not specifically recommended as first line treatment in young children. If asthma is not controlled despite use of ICS, it is advised to double the dose of ICS after unfavourable environmental factors have been excluded. If the result is insufficient, a combination of ICS and a long acting bronchodilator is prescribed in children older than 4 - 6 years of age...|$|E
40|$|Background. For {{pediatric}} {{patients who}} suffer from persistent asthma, <b>inhalation</b> <b>corticosteroid</b> therapy is of an increasing importance. It has been known that inhalation therapy lowers drug related risks in this population. The present study was aimed to show that protective therapy using <b>inhalation</b> <b>corticosteroid</b> fluticasonepropionate (ICS-FP) improves the health status of children with asthma and that low doses of ICS-FP have no clinically significant side effects, even in a long term use. Methods. Sixty-five children with predominantly moderate asthma treated with protective anti-inflammatory drug ICSFP for more than six months were monitored in an ambulatory setting. The study included children and adolescents aged 5 – 18 years. The efficacy of the protective treatment with ICSFP was investigated by measurements of eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) in serum and spirometric parameters at the beginning and after six months of the treatment. The safety of protective treatment was assessed with measurements of body mass and height of the children and morning serum cortisol levels. Results. During the protective treatment the number of asthma exacerbation diminished. The triggers of nonallergic exacerbations were physical activity, changes of weather and viral inflammations and the triggers of allergic asthma exacerbations were allergens (hous-dust mite, pollens and animal dander) and infections.   ECP values similarly showed a statistically significant decrease from 43. 1 ± 27. 8 nmol/L at the beginning to 20. 3 ± 13. 0 nmol/L after six months. Values of spirometric parameters, expressed as percentage of normal values for the population under study, exhibited 7 – 14 % improvement in the six months observation period. All their changes were statistically significant, e. g. in FEV 1 from 82. 8 ± 12. 4 % to 96. 3 ± 16. 0 %.   Despite regular and appropriate treatment with ICS-FP, no decrease in morning serum cortisol levels exceeding normal values were observed. From 417. 1 ± 138. 4 nmol/L {{at the beginning of the}} study, cortisol levels fell to 357. 1 ± 12. 3 nmol/L, a statistically significant difference. However, these changes were small relative to the normal range of cortisol diurnal variability.   Measurements of body mass and height upon regular six months periods did not show significantly lower values from those in healthy populations of same ages. On the contrary, the observed sample even had a significantly higher body height (relative body height increase of 1. 9 %) and body mass (relative body mass increase of 7. 3 %) when compared to healthy population. Conclusions. Present study indicates that ICS-FP protective antiinflammatory treatment of children and adolescents is safe and effective related to the age of the patient and severity of exacerbations.   </em...|$|E

40|$|Background Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} (BPD), {{defined as}} oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), remains an important complication of prematurity. Pulmonary inflammation plays {{a central role}} in the pathogenesis of BPD. Attenuating pulmonary inflammation with postnatal systemic corticosteroids reduces the incidence of BPD in preterm infants but may be associated with an increased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Local administration of corticosteroids via inhalation might be an effective and safe alternative. Objectives To determine if administration of inhalation corticosteroids after the first week of life to preterm infants at high risk of developing BPD is effective and safe in reducing the incidence of death and BPD as separate or combined outcomes. Search methods We identified randomised, controlled trials by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), PubMed (from 1966), EMBASE (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1982), references from retrieved trials and handsearches of journals, all assessed to February 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing inhalation corticosteroids, started >= 7 days postnatal age (PNA) but before 36 weeks PMA, to placebo in ventilated and non-ventilated infants at risk of BPD were included. Trials investigating systemic corticosteroids versus inhalation corticosteroids were excluded. Data collection and analysis Data on patient characteristics, trial methodology, and inhalation regimens were collected. The primary outcomes were death or BPD, or both, at 28 days PNA or 36 weeks PMA. Secondary outcomes were short-term respiratory outcomes, such as failure to extubate, total days of mechanical ventilation and oxygen use, and the need for systemic corticosteroids. The original trialists were contacted to verify the validity of extracted data and to provide missing data. All data were analysed using RevMan 5. 0. 24. When possible, meta-analysis was performed using typical risk ratio (TRR) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes along with their 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Ventilated and non-ventilated participants were analysed separately. Main results Eight trials randomising 232 preterm infants were included in this review. Inhalation corticosteroids did not reduce the separate or combined outcomes of death or BPD. Furthermore, inhalation steroids did not impact short-term respiratory outcomes such as failure to extubate and total duration of mechanical ventilation or oxygen dependency. There was a trend to a reduced use of systemic corticosteroids in favour of inhalation corticosteroids (TRR 0. 51; 95 % CI 0. 26 to 1. 00). There was a paucity of data on short-term and long-term adverse effects. These results should be interpreted with caution because the total number of randomised patients is relatively small and most trials differed considerably in patient characteristics, inhalation therapy and outcome definitions. Authors' conclusions Based on the results of the currently available evidence, inhalation corticosteroids initiated at >= 7 days of life for preterm infants at high risk of developing BPD cannot be recommended at this point in time.

Attenuating pulmonary inflammation with postnatal systemic corticosteroids reduces the incidence of BPD in preterm infants but may be associated with an increased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Local administration of corticosteroids via inhalation might be an effective and safe alternative. To determine if administration of inhalation corticosteroids after the first week of life until 36 weeks PMA to preterm infants at high risk of developing BPD is effective and safe in reducing the incidence of death and BPD as separate or combined outcomes. We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2017, Issue 4), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 19 May 2017), Embase (1980 to 19 May 2017), and CINAHL (1982 to 19 May 2017). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials. We included randomised controlled trials comparing inhalation corticosteroids, started ≥ 7 days postnatal age (PNA) but before 36 weeks PMA, to placebo in ventilated and non-ventilated infants at risk of BPD. We excluded trials investigating systemic corticosteroids versus inhalation corticosteroids. We collected data on participant characteristics, trial methodology, and inhalation regimens. The primary outcome was death or BPD at 36 weeks PMA. Secondary outcomes were the combined outcome death or BPD at 28 days PNA, the seperate outcomes of death and BPD at both 28 days PNA, and at 36 weeks PMA, and short-term respiratory outcomes, such as failure to extubate; total days of mechanical ventilation and oxygen use; and the need for systemic corticosteroids. We contacted the original trialists to verify the validity of extracted data and to provide missing data. We analysed all data using Review Manager 5. When possible, we performed meta-analysis using typical risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes along with their 95 % confidence intervals (CI). We analysed ventilated and non-ventilated participants separately. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. We included eight trials randomising 232 preterm infants in this review. Inhalation corticosteroids did not reduce the separate or combined outcomes of death or BPD. The meta-analyses of the studies showed a reduced risk in favor of inhalation steroids regarding failure to extubate at seven days (typical RR (TRR) 0. 80, 95 % CI 0. 66 to 0. 98; 5 studies, 79 infants) and at the latest reported time point after treatment onset (TRR 0. 60, 95 % CI 0. 45 to 0. 80; 6 studies, 90 infants). However, both analyses showed increased statistical heterogeneity (I(2) statistic 73 % and 86 %, respectively). Furthermore, inhalation steroids did not impact total duration of mechanical ventilation or oxygen dependency. There was a trend toward a reduction in the use of systemic corticosteroids in infants receiving inhalation corticosteroids (TRR 0. 51, 95 % CI 0. 26 to 1. 00; 4 studies, 74 infants; very low-quality evidence).

Title of diploma thesis: Current {{possibilities of}} treatment of asthma The asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of respiratory ways, which affects {{a significant proportion}} of global population and its prevalence is increasing. Together with inflammation, bronchial hyperreactivity and intermittent obstruction of respiratory ways are involved in the iniciation and development of asthma. Asthma is caused not only by the genetic predisposition, but also by the environment and current lifestyle. The repeated states of breathlessness, wheeze on chest, feel of pressure on chest and cough are the typical the clinical symptoms of the clinical picture. These problems occur frequently at night and early in the morning. Classification based on seriousness of clinical status before treatment divides the asthma for intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent and severe persistent. A new approach to the asthma resulted to the changes in pharmacotherapy. The important change was determination of drugs, which will be used to treatment of the acute attacks of asthma and preventive drugs for long-term regular use. <b>Inhalation</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> [...] ...|$|R

All prescriptions of ICS and LA β 2 were analysed and divided in four groups by LAβ 2 use during 1997 and 1998. Date from 15760 patients were available. In the 10 929 patients not treated with LA β 2, compliance decreased slightly but not significantly. In 3281 patients receiving LAβ 2 compliance also decreased slightly but not significantly. In 404 patients, who used a LAβ 2 in 1997 and discontinued treatment in 1998, the compliance fell significantly (P< 0 · 05). In 1147 patients who started to use a LA β 2 in 1998, compliance with ICS significantly improved (P< 0 · 05). These results suggest that the regular use of LAβ 2 improves compliance with ICS.

40|$|Near-fatal asthma (NFA) is {{described}} as acute asthma associated with a respiratory arrest or arterial carbon dioxide tension greater than 50 mmHg, with or without altered consciousness, requiring mechanical ventilation. Risk factors for near fatal asthma have not been fully elucidated. In 80 - 85 % of all fatal events, a phenotype, characterized by eosinophilic inflammation associated with gradual deterioration occurring in patients with severe and poorly controlled asthma, has been identified. Regarding to the management, acute severe asthma remains a significant clinical problem, which needs to be identified to facilitate early and appropriate therapeutic interventions. The assessment relies on clinical signs, but additional information might be obtained from chest radiography or blood gas analysis. No investigation should delay the initiation of appropriate therapy.

We especially looked at the use of folic acid around pregnancy and asthma medication. With a recommended folic acid use of more than 50 % in 2014, folic acid supplementation around pregnancy has stabilized during the last decade in the Netherlands. Certain groups of women are prescribed a higher dose of folic acid during pregnancy that what is normally recommended. Little is known however about possible negative effects.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess, in nondepressed pregnant women, the possible association between CRH levels in pregnancy and depressive symptoms postpartum. METHODS: A questionnaire containing demographic data and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was filled in gestational weeks 17 and 32, and 6 week postpartum. Blood samples were collected in week 17 for assessment of CRH. A logistic regression model was constructed, using postpartum EPDS score as the dependent variable and log-transformed CRH levels as the independent variable. Confounding factors were included in the model. Subanalyses after exclusion of study subjects with preterm birth, newborns small for gestational age (SGA), and women on corticosteroids were performed. RESULTS: Five hundred thirty-five women without depressive symptoms during pregnancy were included. Logistic regression showed an association between high CRH levels in gestational week 17 and postpartum depressive symptoms, before and after controlling for several confounders (unadjusted OR = 1. 11, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 22; adjusted OR = 1. 13, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 1. 26; per 0. 1 unit increase in log CRH). Exclusion of women with preterm birth and newborns SGA as well as women who used <b>inhalation</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> during pregnancy did not alter the results.

Thus, {{the use of}} <b>inhalation</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> (ICS) in the long-term, during a ten-year period is investigated. To describe medication use as a continuum, {{taking into account the}} timeliness and consistency of refilling, a Markov model is proposed. Methods Patients, that filled at least one prescription in 1993, were selected from the PHARMO medical record linkage system (RLS) containing > 95 % prescription dispensings per patient originating from community pharmacy records of 6 medium-sized cities in the Netherlands. The probabilities of continuous use, the refilling of at least one ICS prescription in each year of follow-up, and medication free periods were assessed by Markov analysis. Stratified analysis according to new use was performed. Results The transition probabilities of the refilling of at least one ICS prescription in the subsequent year of follow-up, were assessed for each year of follow-up and for the total study period. The change of transition probabilities in time was evaluated, e. g. the probability of continuing ICS use of starters {{in the first two years}} (51 %) of follow-up increased to more than 70 % in the following years. The probabilities of different patterns of medication use were assessed: continuous use (7. 7 %), cumulative medication gaps (1 – 8 years 69. 1 %) and discontinuing (23. 2 %) during ten-year follow-up for new users. New users had lower probability of continuous use (7. 7 %) and more variability in ICS refill patterns than previous users (56 %). Conclusion In addition to well-established methods in epidemiology to ascertain compliance and persistence, a Markov model could be useful to further specify the variety of possible patterns of medication use within the continuum of adherence. This Markov model describes variation in behaviour and patterns of ICS use and could also be useful to investigate continuous use of other drugs applied in chronic diseases. </p...|$|R

The amount of Treg’s gradually decrease with age in non-atopic children; they also decrease in atopic ones until 6 years, followed by their subsequent stabilization. Thus, a hypothesis is proposed, that the initial changes of Treg’s in case of allergy comprise a reduction in their functions, and, upon complete or partial compensation of this defect by increasing of cell amounts, a remission is initiated.

The results showed that additional inhalation of budesonide and terbutaline could upregulate serum IL- 2 levels, the percentages of CD 3 + T and CD 4 + T cells, and CD 4 /CD 8 ratio, and decrease eosinophils and serum CRP level more efficiently than conventional treatment in patients with AECOPD. And the lung function of the atomization inhalation group was improved more obviously after the treatment compared with the conventional treatment group. Thus, atomization inhalation of terbutaline and budesonide can control AECOPD effectively, and has wide clinical perspective in controlling and preventing the exacerbation of COPD.

40|$|ABSTRACTAirway {{remodeling}} can {{be defined}} as changes in the composition, content, and organization of the cellular and molecular constituents of the airway wall. Airway remodeling is a characteristic feature of asthma, and has important functional implications. These structural changes include epithelial detachment, subepithelial fibrosis, increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass, decreased distance between epithelium and ASM cells, goblet cell hyperplasia, mucus gland hyperplasia, proliferation of blood vessels and airway edema and changes in the cartilage. Each can contribute to airway hyperreactivity (AHR), and may eventually lead to irreversible airflow obstruction with disease progression. Structural changes can be observed from early onset of the disease and thus remodeling is thought to be characteristic of asthma. Some aspects of airway remodeling can be explained as a consequence of TH 2 inflammation, although it has also been suggested that the exaggerated inflammation and remodeling seen in asthmatic airways is the consequence of abnormal injury and repair responses stemming from the susceptibility of bronchial epithelia to components of the inhaled environment. According to this view, remodeling occurs by way of a noninflammatory mechanism, where inflammation of airways and altered structure and function of the airways are parallel and interacting factors. Airway remodeling in established asthma is poorly responsive to current therapies, such as <b>inhalation</b> of <b>corticosteroids</b> and administration of β 2 -agonists, antileukotrienes, and theophylline...|$|R
40|$|A {{randomised}} double-blind {{crossover study}} was undertaken in 25 patients with variable airflow obstruction {{to assess the}} benefit of separating the inhalation of beta-agonist aerosols and corticosteroid aerosols by a timed interval of more than five minutes. Twenty-two patients (11 men and 11 women) completed 12 weeks of study; they inhaled 200 micrograms salbutamol followed either immediately or after a timed interval by 100 micrograms beclomethasone dipropionate two to four times daily. Morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates, symptom scores, additional beta-agonist inhaler usage, and subjective responses on a visual-analogue scale were recorded throughout. Results from the two last four-week periods, with and without the interval between drugs, were analysed. No differences were found. It is concluded that the theoretical benefit of delaying <b>corticosteroid</b> <b>inhalation</b> until optimum bronchodilatation has been achieved with a beta-agonist is not demonstrable in outpatient practice...|$|R
40|$|Lower {{respiratory}} tract illness (LRTI) {{is an important}} health problem in early childhood. More {{than half of all}} infants develop LRTI {{in the first years of}} life. LRTI is an important risk factor for asthma. At the age of six, 10 - 15 % still has symptoms of LRTI. Most of the children grow over the symptoms and turn out to have so called 'transient wheezing'. However, in spite of the good prognosis, these children contribute to high health care utilization and costs. Parents are concerned about the illness and the possible consequences. At this moment there is no rational treatment. Antibiotics and <b>inhalation</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> do not seem to be effective and reassurance is maybe the best treatment. Prediction tools that could distinguish between low and high risk infants for LRTI, could contribute to better management. However, until now there is no prediction tool available for use in healthy infants in primary care. The impact on infants, their parents and health care, together with the lack of prediction tools may be considered as two important arguments for a comprehensive study of neonatal risk for clinical relevant LRTI in the first year of life. First we looked into the determinants of health care utilization for LRTI. We showed that besides complaints, child and parental factors play an important role in help-seeking. It seems that a lot of consultations are driven more by parental anxiety and social reasons than rational medical reasons. Parents expect the general practitioners to help them with knowledge and support, to improve their capability to identify minor illness and act adequately. It is an important challenge for primary care to deal with this need for information and reassurance in an efficient way. With regard to informing and supporting care takers of young infants, it is also very important to assess disease severity and prognosis of patients adequately. We showed that symptoms of wheeze and cough have different determinants already in the first year of life. Probably it is useful to ask parents specifically about these complaints. Furthermore we investigated the possibilities of detecting newborns at risk for developing relevant LRTI in the first year of life. We showed that is was possible to specify the overall risk of LRTI of 26 % to 12 % in low risk infants and to 45 % in high risk infants. Although these differences are interesting and relevant for daily practice, our model could only classify 60 % of our infants correctly. Extending the neonatal characteristics with clinical data later in life will probably improve prediction. Finally we investigated the management of LRTI in the first year of life. Forty percent of our infants with LRTI received medication (20 % antibiotics and 35 % corticosteroids). Besides medical reasons, we showed that child, parental and physician factors play an important role in the decision to prescribe. Doctors should be aware of expectations and anxieties of parents and try to discuss these important issues explicitly with them. Better assessment of disease severity and prognosis of infants could also help to inform parent better...|$|R
40|$|Background: Immunomodulatory {{therapy has}} been {{recently}} introduced {{for the management}} of asthma. Suplatast tosilate (ST), a new immune-modifying drug, is known to improve the airway function by inhibiting the release of Th- 2 cytokines. However, its efficacy as a controller listed in the guideline, Global Initiative for Asthma 2005 has not been established. In this study we investigated the role of ST in leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) non-responders with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma before initiating <b>corticosteroids</b> <b>inhalation</b> therapy. Methods: This was a prospective open-level clinical trial. LTRAs was given to 41 patients with asthma for 4 weeks and clinical efficacy was assessed using daily symptom scores. The 10 patients, aged 2. 5 - 8. 5 years, who failed to show clinical improvement, were defined as LTRA non-responders. After a 1 -week washout period, the efficacy of ST was investigated and compared with LTRA non-responders for the following 4 weeks. Results: LTRA non-responders showed a significant improvement in the average symptom score, peak expiratory flow, use of rescue medication and the proportion of symptom-free days with ST therapy. Conclusions: ST is a good choice for patients who have failed to respond to LTRAs. ST should therefore be added to the list of treatment options for such patients...|$|R
40|$|Cochrane {{systematic}} reviews {{show that}} systemic postnatal corticosteroids {{reduce the risk}} of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. However, corticosteroids have also been associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental impairment. It is unknown whether these beneficial and adverse effects are modulated by differences in corticosteroid treatment regimens. To assess the effects of different corticosteroid treatment regimens on mortality, pulmonary morbidity, and neurodevelopmental outcome in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 2) in the Cochrane Library (searched 21 March 2016), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 21 March 2016), Embase (1980 to 21 March 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to 21 March 2016). We also searched clinical trials' databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing two or more different treatment regimens of systemic postnatal corticosteroids in preterm infants at risk for BPD, as defined by the original trialists. Studies investigating one treatment regimen of systemic corticosteroids to a placebo or studies using <b>inhalation</b> <b>corticosteroids</b> were excluded. Two authors independently assessed eligibility and quality of trials and extracted data on study design, participant characteristics and the relevant outcomes. We asked the original investigators to verify if data extraction was correct and, if possible, to provide any missing data. The primary outcomes to be assessed were: mortality at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) or at hospital discharge; BPD defined as oxygen dependency at 36 weeks' PMA; long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae, including cerebral palsy, measured by the Bayley Mental Developmental Index (MDI); and blindness or poor vision. Secondary outcomes were: duration of mechanical ventilation and failure to extubate at day 3 and 7 after initiating therapy; rescue treatment with corticosteroids outside the study period; and the incidence of hypertension, sepsis and hyperglycemia during hospitalizations. Data were analyzed using Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. Fourteen studies were included in this review. Only RCTs investigating dexamethasone were identified. Eight studies enrolling a total of 303 participants investigated the cumulative dosage administered; three studies contrasted a high versus a moderate and five studies a moderate versus a low cumulative dexamethasone dose. Analysis of the studies investigating a moderate dexamethasone dose versus a high-dosage regimen showed an increased risk of BPD (typical risk ratio (RR) 1. 50, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 01 to 2. 22; typical risk difference (RD) 0. 26, 95 % CI 0. 03 to 0. 49; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 4, 95 % CI 1. 9 to 23. 3; I^ 2 = 0 %, 2 studies, 55 infants) as well as an increased risk of abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome (typical RR 8. 33, 95 % CI 1. 63 to 42. 48; RD 0. 30, 95 % CI 0. 14 to 0. 46; NNTH 4, 95 % CI 2. 2 to 7. 3; I^ 2 = 68 %, 2 studies, 74 infants) when using a moderate cumulative-dosage regimen. The composite outcomes of death or BPD and death or abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome showed similar results although the former only reached borderline significance. There were no differences in outcomes between a moderate- and a low-dosage regimen. Four other studies enrolling 762 infants investigated early initiation of dexamethasone therapy versus a moderately early or delayed initiation and showed no significant differences in the primary outcomes. The two RCTs investigating a continuous versus a pulse dexamethasone regimen showed an increased risk of the combined outcome death or BPD when using the pulse therapy. Finally, two trials investigating a standard regimen versus a participant-individualized course of dexamethasone showed no difference in the primary outcome and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. The quality of evidence for all comparisons discussed above was assessed as low or very low, because the validity of all comparisons is hampered by small samples of randomized infants, heterogeneity in study population and design, non-protocolized use of 'rescue' corticosteroids and lack of long-term neurodevelopmental data in most studies. Despite the fact that some studies reported a modulating effect of treatment regimens in favor of higher-dosage regimens on the incidence of BPD and neurodevelopmental impairment, recommendations on the optimal type of corticosteroid, the optimal dosage, or the optimal timing of initiation for the prevention of BPD in preterm infants cannot be made based on current level of evidence. A well-designed large RCT is urgently needed to establish the optimal systemic postnatal corticosteroid dosage regime...|$|R

It causes bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation and may therefore exacerbate allergen responses. This study examined whether LPS and ovalbumin co-administration could exacerbate the airway inflammatory and functional responses to ovalbumin in conscious guinea pigs and whether these exacerbated responses were insensitive to inhaled corticosteroid treatment with fluticasone propionate (FP). Experimental Approach Guinea pigs were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin and airway function recorded as specific airway conductance by whole body plethysmography. Airway inflammation was measured from lung histology and bronchoalveolar lavage. Airway hyper-reactivity (AHR) to inhaled histamine was examined 24 [*]h after ovalbumin. LPS was inhaled alone or 24 or 48 [*]h before ovalbumin and combined with ovalbumin.

40|$|AbstractForced expiratory volumes {{are reduced}} in chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD), mainly {{as a result}} of inflammatory and morphological changes in the small airways (with a diameter < 2 mm) and in the alveoli. However, it is difficult to detect minor changes in small airways by spirometry measurements. To study the effects on small airways of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), 19 stable COPD patients were investigated; 15 were evaluated by ventilation–perfusion (VA/Q) relationships, assessed by the multiple inert gas elimination technique, and by diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), assessed by the single breath technique. Measurements were repeated after 2 months of budesonide inhalations (800 μg) twice daily. Before ICS treatment: mean forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1) as a percentage of predicted (% P) was 40 · 1 (± 16 · 0) %, DLCO% P was 45 · 7 (± 25 · 0) % and 6 · 0 (± 6 · 4) % of the ventilation was directed at high VA/Q areas. The mean of the VA/Q ratio for ventilation (V-mean) was 2 · 7 times higher than normal. After 2 months of ICS: the mean of DLCO% P increased by 8 · 6 (± 19 · 4) %, and FEV 1 /vital capacity decreased by 6 · 9 (± 11 · 3) %. Basal morning and ACTH-stimulated S-cortisol levels were significantly reduced. All the VA/Q relationships remained unchanged. In conclusion, a significant increase in diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide levels after treatment with <b>corticosteroid</b> <b>inhalations</b> for 2 months was shown, but no significant improvements were found in forced expiratory airflow, lung volumes, or VA/Q relationships...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY A 4 -month {{period of}} {{physical}} training increased the physical working capacity of 16 asthmatic children (aged between 9 - 3 and 13 * 6 years) {{by a mean}} of 11 %. The increase was greater in boys and was negatively correlated with pretraining capacity. Urinary excretion of adrenaline, measured during a submaximal exercise test, decreased during the training period; the decrease was correlated {{with the increase in}} working capacity. Before the training period, exercise induced an increase in the plasma cortisol level; no increase was evident after training. In contrast, the training did not affect the exercise-induced increase in the plasma growth hormone level. Training programmes have been evaluated (Geubelle et al., 1971; Vavra et al., 1971; Fitch et al., 1976) for improving the poor physical fitness of asthmatic children (Fowler and Gardner, 1963; Godfrey, 1974). The disturbing effect of exercise-induced bronchospasm (Jones et al., 1962; Bierman et al., 1975) can be avoided by swimming training (Fitch et al., 1976) or by dividing the training into short bursts of activity (Strick, 1969). Exercise stimulates the secretion of several hormones (Felig and Wahren, 1975) and trainingmay modify the responses (Hartley et al., 1972 a). Therefore, we set out to study whether the exercise-induced responses of adrenaline, cortisol, and growth hormone (GH) would change during a training programme for asthmatic children. Subjects Eight boys and 8 girls (see Table for clinical data) consented (with the approval of their parents) to participate in the exercise tests and the training programme. All the children had bronchial asthma diagnosed more than 4 years earlier. Five children had a history of exercise-induced asthma; all of them, and 2 others, used sodium chromoglycate <b>inhalations.</b> No oral <b>corticosteroids</b> were used, bu...|$|R
40|$|By {{measuring}} retention {{in blood}} and excretion in exhaled air of six infused inert gases using multiple inert gas technique (MIGET), {{it is possible to}} obtain detailed assessment of the ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) relationships in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Stable, non-bronchitic COPD patients show a substantial perfusion of hyper-ventilated lung regions. For individuals with exclusively nocturnal hypoxaemia, when the nocturnal arterial oxygen saturation (Sa 02) is below 90 %, an increase in dispersion of ventilation (log SW) is present together with significantly prolonged superficial sleep compared with normal. Substantial perfusion of relatively poorly ventilated lung areas (0. 1 A/Q< 0. 3) may reflect severity of nocturnal hypoxaemia. Reduced nocturnal Sa 02 associates with frequent sleep stage changes when compared with healthy individuals. A significant deterioration in lung function and a prolongation of proper sleep time precede the appearance of a low resting, daytime Pa 02 level of less than 7. 3 kPa or 7. 3 - 7. 9 kPa in presence of severe heart failure (denoted daytime hypoxaemia), with no development of progressive nocturnal hypoxaemia. Long-term oxygen treatment (LTOT) given for six months to stable COPD patients with daytime hypoxaemia is not accompanied by an increase in shunt, or by any significant changes in the VA/Q ratios. LTOT tends to reduce minute ventilation. Sensitivity of the central respiratory center to hypercapnea may be assessed by carbon dioxide (C 02) rebreathing tests. The ventilatory response to hypercapnea (HCVR) is influenced by chest wall mechanics and level of airway resistance. Hypercapnic respiratory drive response assessed as inspiratory mouth occlusion pressure for 100 msec. (PiO. 1) reflects output of the central respiratory centre and strength of the respiratory muscles. In COPD patients with daytime hypoxaemia or with exclusively nocturnal hypoxaemia, the baseline respiratory drive (before C 02 rebreathing) is significantly increased compared with normal. Although HCVR is reduced, respiratory drive response remains at a normal level in such COPD patients. <b>Inhalations</b> of <b>corticosteroids</b> for two months in stable, emphysematous COPD patients are not associated with changes in lung volumes or in ventilation-perfusion matching, but may significantly improve diffusing capacity, probably by diminishing inflammatory processes in the small airways. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning of the lungs is an excellent method for localising and describing the extent of emphysema (which is inversely correlated with lung volumes and diffusing capacity), but is not related to either ventilation-perfusion inequality or blood gas levels. Conclusions: The MIGET test, using peripheral venous samples, is a reliable method for prospective studies of VA/Q relationships in COPD. In stable, non-bronchitic, emphysematous COPD patients: l A significant increase in minute ventilation to sparsely perfused lung regions (high VA/Q) is present. l Substantial nocturnal hypoxaemia may persist for at least one year before daytime hypoxaemia develops. l Sleep fragmentation and high C 02 sensitivity are important defence mechanisms against sleep- related hypoxaemia. l Important daytime hypoxaemia regulators are level of shunt and increase in minute ventilation to high VA/Q areas. l HCVR is an important regulator of the PaC 02 level...|$|R
