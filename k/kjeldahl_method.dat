5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>method.</b> In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{establish}} {{a method for}} determination of protein content in food based on elemental analysis. Methods Protein contents of 16 kinds of powder food were determined by both elemental analysis and <b>Kjeldahl’s</b> <b>method.</b> Results based on two different methods were compared. Results The elemental analysis method could determine the protein content correctly, with good repeatability and accuracy, achieving comparable results to <b>Kjeldahl’s</b> <b>method.</b> The elemental analysis method showed more advantages such as little need of sample amount, simple experimental operation, high detecting efficiency and automaticity.

30|$|The {{nitrogen}} (N) {{content in}} leaves of these crops {{was measured using}} modified <b>Kjeldahl’s</b> <b>method</b> (Jackson 1973). The P content was calculated by vanado-molybdo-phosphoric acid yellow colour method (Jackson 1973) and the K content was measured with a flame photometer. The N, P and K content in leaves was multiplied with the respective dry matter of total biomass to get N, P and K uptake in crop. The soil samples from the experimental plots were analyzed for total N (modified <b>Kjeldahl’s</b> <b>method,</b> Jackson 1973) and available-P (Bray I method, Jackson 1973) and extractable-K content (flame photometer) at 2  weeks after transplanting during the first mustard cropping and after harvesting the first, second and the third mustard cropping.|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the feasibility of}} measuring absorbance in the far ultraviolet for serum protein determination with a medium-priced, double-beam spectrophotometer. The method has been simplified by using an automatic dilutor to dilute the serum, and a flow-through cell and recorder {{in conjunction with the}} spectrophotometer. Because it is only necessary to dilute the serum and determine its ab-sorbance, the procedure is quite rapid. As compared to the biuret reaction, interferences from hemolysis have been about halved. Interferences owing to light scattering by turbid sera have also been appreciably decreased by use of an anionic detergent (sodium dodecyl sulfate) as a serum diluent.

5000|$|The <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>method</b> or Kjeldahl {{digestion}} (...) in {{analytical chemistry}} {{is a method}} for the quantitative determination of nitrogen contained in organic substances plus the nitrogen in inorganic ammonia and ammonium (NH3/NH4+).

The traditional method for measuring total protein uses the biuret reagent, but other chemical methods such as <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>method,</b> dye-binding and refractometry are now available.

40|$|This {{study of}} the {{measurement}} and behaviour of nitrogen in soil is split into three main parts: 1) An investigation of the <b>Kjeldahl</b> digestion <b>method</b> for measuring total nitrogen in soil and plant materials. 2) A {{study of the}} effect of air drying, temperature and repeated ammonium application on nitrification rates and 3) An investigation of ammonium contamination at a former nylon factory site. The investigation of the <b>Kjeldahl</b> digestion <b>method</b> was made by comparing measured values of total nitrogen using a standard <b>Kjeldahl</b> digestion <b>method</b> and salicylic acid modification digestion method. For each method three different catalyst mixtures were used. Measurements were made of certified reference plant materials (hay and cabbage) and a comparison was made of two soil samples. The standard <b>Kjeldahl</b> digestion <b>method</b> with 1 g of sodium sulphate/copper sulphate mixture (100 : 10) measured significantly lower nitrogen (P&# 60; 5 %) than the certified reference value for hay but not cabbage. Significantly lower (P&# 60; 5 %) total nitrogen was measured in soil samples than with 2. 5 g of sodium sulphate/copper sulphate mixture (110 : 10) and Kjeltabs (2. 5 g potassium sulphate/copper sulphate/selenium, 100 : 10 : 1). The reason for the lower recovery of total nitrogen with 1 g of catalyst is the lower digestion temperature which causes incomplete digestion. The 2. 5 g of catalyst mixture and Kjeltabs with the standard method gave significantly (P&# 60; 5 %) higher total nitrogen than the certified values for both hay and cabbage. The high values of total nitrogen measured for plant material were probably due to variable recovery of the high levels of nitrate which were present in the plant material at 3. 1 mg g - 1 (hay) and 3. 2 mg g- 1 (cabbage). The salicylic acid modification method measured significantly higher total nitrogen than the certified reference values using all catalyst mixtures with both plant materials. This higher recovery of total nitrogen was due to partial recovery of nitrate as the method used for the certified values would not have recovered nitrate...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>method's</b> universality, {{precision}} and reproducibility {{have made it}} the internationally recognized method for estimating the protein content in foods {{and it is the}} standard method against which all other methods are judged. It is also used to assay soils, waste waters, fertilizers and other materials. It does not, however, give a measure of true protein content, as it measures nonprotein nitrogen in addition to the nitrogen in proteins. This is evidenced by the 2007 pet food incident and the 2008 Chinese milk powder scandal, when melamine, a nitrogen-rich chemical, was added to raw materials to fake high protein contents. Also, different correction factors are needed for different proteins to account for different amino acid sequences. Additional disadvantages, such as the need to use concentrated sulfuric acid at high temperature and the relatively long testing time (an hour or more), compare unfavorably with the Dumas method for measuring crude protein content.|$|R

50|$|The Dumas {{method has}} the {{advantages}} of being {{easy to use and}} fully automated. It is also considerably faster than the <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>method,</b> taking a few minutes per measurement, as compared to the hour or more for Kjeldahl. It also does not make use of toxic chemicals or catalysts. One major disadvantage is its high initial cost, although new technology developments are reducing this. Also, as with Kjeldahl, it does not give a measure of true protein, as it registers nonprotein nitrogen, and different correction factors are needed for different proteins because they have different amino acid sequences.|$|E
5000|$|The classic assays for protein {{concentration}} in food are the <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>method</b> and the Dumas method. These tests determine the total nitrogen in a sample.

If the amount of nitrogen is multiplied by a factor depending on the kinds of protein expected in the food the total protein can be determined. This value {{is known as the}} [...] "crude protein" [...] content. On food labels the protein is given by the nitrogen multiplied by 6.25, because the average nitrogen content of proteins is about 16%. The Kjeldahl test is typically used because it is the method the AOAC International has adopted and is therefore used by many food standards agencies around the world, though the Dumas method is also approved by some standards organizations.|$|E
30|$|Between 29 and 57  days after sowing (DAS), {{depending}} on the climatic conditions, five plants were randomly collected from each plot to evaluate the performance at the vegetative growth.

Extractable C and N were determined in the same extract. The total C and N in the extracts were determined by the Walkley and Black and <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>methods,</b> respectively (Nelson and Sommers 1982; Bremner 1965), maintaining the extracts frozen at − 15  °C until analyzed (Hargreaves et al. 2003). For the measurement of CO 2 evolution, 100  g of moist soil were placed {{at the bottom of}} a 1.5  l air-tight sealed jar, together with 10  ml of 0.5  N KOH. Two replicates were made for each sample and three jars with KOH but with no soil were used as the controls (Alef 1995). All the jars were incubated for 15  days at 25  ±  2  °C and the CO 2 evolved then determined by titration. The fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity (FDA) was determined using the method described by Adam and Duncan (2001). The metabolic quotient (qCO 2) was expressed from the ratio between basal respiration and microbial biomass C (Anderson and Domsch 1990) and the Cmic:Corg and Nmic:Ntot ratios expressed as the amounts of Cmic and Nmic per unit of Corg and Ntot, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The method {{consists}} of combusting {{a sample of}} known mass in a high temperature (about 900°C) chamber {{in the presence of}} oxygen. This leads to the release of carbon dioxide, water and nitrogen. The gases are then passed over special columns(such as potassium hydroxide aqueous solution) that absorb the carbon dioxide and water. A column containing a thermal conductivity detector at the end is then used to separate the nitrogen from any residual carbon dioxide and water and the remaining nitrogen content is measured. The instrument must first be calibrated by analyzing a material that is pure and has a known nitrogen concentration. The measured signal from the thermal conductivity detector for the unknown sample can then be converted into a nitrogen content. As with the <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>method,</b> conversion of the concentration of nitrogen in a sample to the crude protein content is performed using conversion factors which depend on the particular amino acid sequence of the measured protein.|$|E

This study consists in modifying cellulose by grafting of the amidoxime groups for its use in the adsorption of the Cu 2 +, Cr 3 + and sulphide ions present in industrial waste waters. Cellulose is an abundant biodegradable polymer. The amidoxime groups are strong complexants of metal ions. The grafting is achieved in two steps: cyanoethylation and amidoximation, confirmed by FT-IR. The optimum conditions and the parameters influencing the two reactions are determined by the <b>kjeldahl's</b> <b>method</b> and by FT-IR.

The implementation of the modified cellulose is intended for the adsorption of the metal ions Cu 2 + and Cr 3 + and sulphide ions S 2 − in a double adsorption. The FT-IR analysis reveals that the fixing of metal cations is based on the complexation of the latter with the ligands of the adsorbent. The optimum adsorption was recorded at pH = 6 for a contact time of 5 h and an initial concentration of 10 − 1 M in metals.
