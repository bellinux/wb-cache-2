40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 43 - 44) The {{purpose of}} this report was to design {{one of the major}} components of a newly developed Solar Energy Powered Absorption Refrigeration System which was intended for use in air conditioning systems for residential and commercial projects. This component is the evaporator section of the system. The basic refrigerative system uses sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN as the absorbent medium, and ammonia (NH 3) as the refrigerant. The heat required to drive the ammonia out of solution is supplied by the system solar collectors delivering 215 ?? F water. In the design and testing of the evaporator, detailed investigation and experiments were made not only on necessary steps required for the design of the evaporator, but also on the related components of the apparatus which have certain influence on the heat transfer process and performance of the evaporator. In addition to the fundamental steps involved in the design, such as: cooling load analysis, material selections, <b>evaporator</b> <b>housing</b> and heat transfer element design, air duct and piping system design, etc., efforts were also made on investigating various methods for control of the system refrigerant liquid and vapor flows, pressure regulating, and refrigerant distribution techniques required for proper function and performance of the evaporator in connection with the entire absorption system as a whole...|$|E
5000|$|In January 1952 [...] "Commonwealth Hostels Limited" [...] {{took over}} {{management}} of the Colmslie Migrant Hostel. Although it was policy that assisted British migrants should live at hostels, there were also non-British migrants at Colmslie in the late 1950s. According to one woman who lived there between 1959 and 1962, these included Germans, Finns, Danes, Yugoslavs, and Russians. Mr Flood, the hostel's Manager at the time, lived in a bungalow (no longer extant) surrounded by palm trees and hibiscus. This was originally the Factory manager's office and laboratory, situated south of the <b>Evaporator</b> <b>House.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} Colmslie Migrant Hostel, the Acidifier House {{was used}} for {{accommodation}}, and as a dining room and kitchen. The Engineer's Office and Fitter's Shop became a baggage store and the Assistant Manager's quarters, and the Winch House became a tool room. The <b>Evaporator</b> <b>House</b> was used for accommodation, ablutions and recreation, and the Alcohol Still house was also used for accommodation. The Engine Room was used for accommodation and recreation, and the Boiler House {{was used as a}} laundry. The Lime Slacking Store became an office, and the Excise Office, Fertiliser House and Painter's Shop building (extended to the south around 1949) became a store.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the two storey <b>Evaporator</b> <b>House</b> and Alcohol Still House has been refurbished for use as offices, with a mezzanine level at {{the eastern end of}} the first floor. The original timber roof trusses survive above the office cubicles, there are small vents two thirds up the walls at regular intervals, and the ends of metal bolts can also be seen, ground-off flush with the brickwork. There is an outside stairway to the mezzanine level on the east face of the building, and there is a concrete ramp to the first floor entrance near the western end. Dormer windows {{have been added to the}} corrugated iron roof above the mezzanine floor.|$|R
50|$|The Lime Slacking Store is an L-shaped {{single-storey}} building, {{built of}} brick with a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron. It {{has been converted}} into a cold room. Some of the double-hung sash windows have been bricked over, while others have been painted over. A brick-lined gutter runs along the ground {{on the south side of}} the building. Just north of the store is the small, brick Lime Slacking House, which is visually obscured by a modern metal-clad extension to the south of the Alcohol Still House. Just to the west of the Lime Slacking Store is the T-shaped single storey timber Excise Office, Fertilizer House and Painters' Shop building, which is clad in weatherboards and has a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron.

A large modern {{factory building}} occupies most of {{the southern part of the}} site. The original factory buildings are further north, and are stepped down the north face of the slope towards the Brisbane River. Elements of the Acetate of Lime Factory that still exist on the eastern side of the internal roadway include: the Lime Slacking Store and the Lime Slacking House; the Excise Office, Fertilizer House and Painters' Shop building; the <b>Evaporator</b> <b>House</b> and Alcohol Still House; the Engine Room; the Boiler House and Chimney; and a small latrine block. To the west of the internal road are: the ground floor of the Acidifier House; the Winch House, and the Engineers' Office and Fitters' Shop. To the north of the Engineers' Office and Fitters' shop are two huts that were introduced as extra migrant accommodation.|$|R

5000|$|The {{process of}} making acetate of lime started with {{molasses}} (from the Babinda and Mulgrave sugar mills) that had been shipped from Cairns to Brisbane. The molasses was pumped into a holding tank near the river, and was diluted with water. The liquid was then heated and cooled in the three-storey Agitator and Cooler House, to destroy foreign bacteria. In the two-storey Fermenting House yeast was added to large wooden temperature-controlled vats, with fermentation producing a dilute (8%) solution of alcohol (ethanol). The [...] "wash" [...] was transferred to vats {{on the top floor}} of the three-storey Settling House, where it was allowed to settle out. The wash was then transferred to the adjacent three-storey Acidifier House, where it was repeatedly pumped through wooden vats, which contained wood shavings and Bacterium Aceti. Over several days, the alcohol was converted into acetic acid (vinegar). The new wash was heated by steam coils, and the acetic acid and water was distilled off, in the two-storey <b>Evaporator</b> <b>House.</b> The acid distillate was neutralised with milk of lime to produce acetate of lime, and this solution was concentrated for evaporation on a heated revolving drum, where it was scraped off as solid flakes. The bagged product was then sent to Maribyrnong for conversion into acetone. Acetone enabled the combination of nitro-glycerine and trinitrocellulose to form cordite.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work a {{mathematical}} model based on set of nonlinear equations has been developed for synthesis of multiple effect evaporator (MEE) systems. As <b>evaporator</b> <b>house</b> {{is one of the}} most energy intensive units of pulp and paper industries, different configurations are considered in the model to reduce the energy consumption. These are condensate, feed and product flashing, vapor bleeding, steam splitting, etc. Along with these the present model also accounts the complexities of real MEE system such as variable physical properties, boiling point rise. Along with complexities discussed above, the present model also accounts the fouling resistance. For this purpose a linear correlation is developed to predict fouling resistance based on velocity as well as temperature difference. The fouling resistance observed by this correlation is within the limit shown in the literature (Muller-Steinhagen and Branch, 1997). It reduces overall heat transfer coefficient by 11. 5 % on average. For the present study two MEE systems of typical Indian pulp and paper industries are considered. First MEE system selected for modeling and simulation is seven effect evaporator system located in north India which is being operated in a nearby Indian Kraft Paper Mill for concentrating weak black liquor using plate falling film evaporators. This system employs steam splitting in first two effects, feed and product flashing along with primary and secondary condensate flashing to generate auxiliary vapor, which are then used in vapor bodies of appropriate effects to improve overall steam economy of the system. The second system used for present study is located in south India. It is ten effect evaporator system used for concentrating black liquor and being operated in mixed flow sequence. In this system feed and steam splitting as well as vapor bleeding is employed. For seven effect evaporator system total fourteen models are developed. Initially, a simplest model without any variation is derived based on mass and energy balance. Further, it is improved by incorporating different configurations such as variation in physical properties, BPR, steam splitting, feed, product and condensate flashing and vapor bleeding. These models are developed with and without fouling resistance. The governing equations of these models are nonlinear in nature. Further, it is observed that for these models the number of equations as well as the number of variables are equal and hence unique solution exist for all cases. The set of nonlinear algebraic equations are solved using software called ‘system of non linear equations’. However, in the present work to incorporate the complex interactions of variables during solution of model an iterative procedure is used. For seven effect evaporator system total 14 models are proposed to visualize that how individual configuration is affecting the steam economy of the MEE system. The comparison shows that maximum steam economy is observed for the model where flashing as well as vapor bleeding are used. In comparison to the simplest system the improvement in steam economy through best model is found as 27. 3 %. The modified seven effect evaporator system, obtained using best model, requires four shell and tube heat exchangers and five pumps. This modification has total capital investment as Rs 29. 3 lakh. However, saving in steam consumption is found as Rs 21. 8 lakh/year thus, total payback period for the modified seven effect evaporator system is 1. 3 years. For ten effect evaporator system improvement in steam economy is observed by 12. 8 % in comparison to existing system. It incorporates three preheaters which use bled vapor from the system. Based on the comparison with published model as well as industrial data it is found that the present model can be effectively applied to simulate the real MEE system and improve the steam economy of MEE system by 15 %...|$|R
40|$|The article {{considered}} {{the influence of}} the heat consumers distribution and the flashing vapours effect juice for multipleevaporator sugar factory on the consumption the main production flow of heat transfer agent – water vapor. The problem of rational distribution of heat transfer agent for of the corps multiple-evaporator is relevant from point of view of energy saving and energysaving heat of the sugar factory. The solution to this problem is advantageously carried out on the basis of quantitative mathematical description of the distribution of vapor on the corps of the evaporation plant. The heat consumers distribution should be based on technical and economic calculation. To solve this problem it is advisable to use a single equation that determines the dependence of the steam flow in the first unit evaporator on the amount of evaporated water and the method of heat consumers distribution for <b>housing.</b> <b>Evaporators</b> sugar factory has two functions – technology and heat, each of which is described by its equation.
