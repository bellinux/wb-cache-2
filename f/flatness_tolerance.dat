25|$|Surface quality {{measures}} the deviations from a perfect, ideal surface. Increasing the surface quality reduces distortion, artifacts, and aberration in images, and helps increase coherence, collimation, and reduce unwanted divergence in beams. For plane mirrors, {{this is often}} {{described in terms of}} flatness, while other surface shapes are compared to an ideal shape. The surface quality is typically measured with items like interferometers or optical flats, and are usually measured in wavelengths of light (λ). A normal household-mirror made with float glass may have <b>flatness</b> <b>tolerances</b> as low as 9--14λ per inch, equating to a deviation of 5600 through 8800 nanometers from perfect flatness. Precision ground and polished mirrors intended for lasers or telescopes may have tolerances as high as λ/50 (1/50 of the wavelength of the light, or around 12 nm).|$|R
40|$|Liquid crystal (LC) wave {{plates were}} {{produced}} using a photosensitive polymer to generate alignment. Currently, alignment of liquid crystals is achieved {{through the use}} of mechanical buffing, although this process is relatively imprecise and inherently generates particulate contamination. Photoalignment of LC wave plates using a coumarin-based photopolymer resolves many of these fundamental problems with buffing. Because photoalignment of LC wave plates is a non-contact process, it provides high-quality LC alignment without introducing particulate contamination on to the substrate. For the low-birefringence LC materials used for wave plate fabrication, the alignment quality produced using coumarin-based photopolymers is most greatly impacted by the surface quality and optical uniformity of the substrates. When substrates with relaxed scratch/dig, wedge and <b>flatness</b> <b>tolerances</b> were used, LC alignment was poor with numerous disclinations (alignment defects). When substrate quality was improved, the number of disclinations was vastly reduced.

In addition, grating spectrometers based on CAT gratings are well-suited for co-existence with high-energy focal plane microcalorimeter detectors as planned for the Constellation-X mission, since most high-energy x rays are neither absorbed nor deflected, and arrive at the telescope focus. We describe the CAT grating principle and design, and fabrication and x-ray diffraction efficiency results for a CAT grating with 1742 lines/mm.

40|$|A key design {{challenge}} for the National Ignition Facility (NIF), being constructed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), [Hibbard, R L, 1998], is the frequency converter consisting of two KDP crystals and a focusing lens Frequency conversion is a critical performance factor for NIF and the optical mount design for this {{plays a key role}} in meeting design specifications The frequency converter is a monolithic cell that mounts the optics and is the point on the beamline where the frequency conversion crystals are optimally aligned and the cell is focused on target The lasing medium is neodymium in phosphate glass with a fundamental frequency (1 {omega}) of 1 053 {micro}m Sum frequency generation in a pair of conversion crystals (KDP/KD*P) produces 1 8 MJ of the third harmonic light (3 {omega} or {lambda}=O 35 pm). The phase-matching scheme on NIF is type I second harmonic generation followed by type II sum-frequency-mixing of the residual fundamental and the second harmonic light This laser unlike previous laser system designs, must achieve high conversion efficiency, 85 %, which is close to the 90 8 % theoretical maximum As a result, this design is very sensitive to angular variations in beam propagation and in the crystal axes orientation. Factors that influence the phase matching angle include crystal inhomogeneity, residual and induced stress in the crystals, the crystals` natural and mounted surface figure, mounting imperfections and gravity sag These angular variations need to be controlled within a 40 {micro}rad error budget. The optical mount contributions to the angular error budget are 20 {micro}rad and are what make the frequency converter in the Final Optics Cell (FOC) such a challenging precision design. The premise of using full edge support in the FOC design is primarily driven by the spherical target chamber design that has optics mounted at multiple longitudinal angles and thus gravity sag in the crystals that needs to be minimized To meet the angular performance requirements, a precision monolithic cell with full edge support for mounting the optics to 10 {micro}rad angular and 1 - 5 {micro}m <b>flatness</b> <b>tolerances</b> is required The NIF frequency converter design is a major step in improving both conversion efficiency and precision of the mount design Another major consideration in the FOC design is the trade-off between cost of manufacturing the cell and the performance of the mount An interesting balance of what can be accomplished with a conventional machine tool in a commercial shop to produce prototype FOC` s will be discussed Metrology issues involved in qualifying the FOC are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: More {{and more}} often, {{procedures}} for profile/surface monitoring and inspection refer to geometric specifications. In fact, {{the number of}} form tolerance requirements (such as straightness, roundness, flatness, cylindricity, free-form profiles and surfaces) are increasingly appearing in technical drawings. Usually, Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs) are used to measure points on the specific feature under study in order {{to decide whether the}} machined item is conforming to requirements. In fact, measured points are used to compute the form error which has to be smaller than the tolerance value to avoid scrapping or reworking. The estimated form error is usually affected by uncertainty, which depends on both the sample size (number of points measured on the profile/surface) and the sampling strategy (location of the points on the profile/surface). The present research work focuses on the second issue and investigates the performance of several existing sampling strategies with the ones achieved by two newly presented approaches. These new approaches explore advantages arising by including a statistical analysis of a set of machined features in the sampling strategy design.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to use the}} concept of {{uncertainty}} to improve the effectiveness of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems. Uncertainty is a rather new concept in PLM that has been introduced with the new technical language, drawn by ISO, to manage Geometrical Product Specification and Verification (GPS) in the challenging environment of modern manufacturing. GPS standards regard in particular design and verification environments, and want to guarantee consistence of information through a technical language which define both specification and verification on sound logical and mathematical bases. In this context, uncertainty is introduced as the instrument that measures consistency: between the designer intentions (specifications) and the manufactured artefact (as it is observed through measurement) as well as between the measurand definition provided by designers (the specification again) and that used by metrologists. The implications of such an approach have been analyzed through a case study dealing with <b>flatness</b> <b>tolerance</b> and paying particular attention to the verification processes based on Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMM). A Design of Experiment (DoE) has been used and results have been analyzed and used to build a regression model that allows generalization in the experiment validity domain. Then, using Category Theory, a categorical data model has been defined which represents the operation based structure of GPS language and uses the flatness research results in order to design a software able to concretize the GPS vision of geometrical product specifications management. This software is able to translate specification requirements into verification instructions, estimate the uncertainty introduced by simplified verification operations and evaluate costs and risks of verification operations. It provides an important tool for designers, as it allows a responsible definition of specifications (designer can simulate the interpretation of specifications and have an idea of the costs related with their verification), and for metrologist, as it can be a guide for designing GPS compliant verification missions or handling the usual verification procedures according to the GPS standards. However, during the study, it has been matured the consciousness that this approach, even if correct and valuable, was not the most suitable to fully exploit the real potential of CMM. Then, aside the GPS oriented work, an adaptive sampling strategy, based on Kriging modelization, has been proposed with very encouraging result...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. A {{substantial}} {{raise in}} recuperator effectiveness {{has been established}} in the past by improving the fabricating and joining configurations regarding the manufacturing of compact recuperators. Further advancement of state-of-the-art recuperators requires providing for increased temperatures and pressures. 1 bis can only be achieved by incorporating high temperature materials into the recuperator design. Although many high temperature materials have been identified in past research, less of these can be utilized in new concepts due to difficulties regarding fabricating and joining. However recently, in an independent study, a tungsten-copper alloy was identified through detailed material selection methods as a suitable material for high temperature applications. The validity of tungsten-copper regarding fabricating and joining, to establish a leak tight structure still needs to be demonstrated. The aim of the study is to carry out a comprehensive review of existing recuperator technologies and design methodologies as well as to investigate the manufacturability of tungsten-copper for use in a recuperator design of limited size. More specifically, the objectives entail the following: (1) The comprehensive review of existing recuperator technologies and recuperator design methodologies, (2) The design and fabrication of a recuperator of limited size using tungsten-copper as a heat transfer material and (3) The determination of the feasibility of fabrication of the design and the applicability of the selected W -eu alloy in the design. The fabrication technique that is presented in the design entailed the use of 2. Irm tungsten carbide drill bits to machine the correct recuperator profile, while the recuperator unit was joined by utilizing a mechanical fastening system. Although diffusion bonding was initially identified as the ideal joining technique for the recuperator of this research, restrictions and limitations relating to the use of diffusion bonding has lead to the identification of a fastening system as the technique used. Evaluation of the fabricated recuperator revealed that several factors were outside the initially specified values, inter alia the <b>flatness</b> <b>tolerance</b> of recuperator plate geometries and machined slots precision. These factors contributed to a leaJdng recuperator structure when tested. The most likely contributing factors for the latter relate to non-conforming tolerances achieved in the fabricated design, residual stresses induced by the machining process as well as design issues relating to the recuperator plate geometries. The design and fabrication of a recuperator of limited size using tungsten-copper as a heat transfer material, requires re-evaluation. Similar work will ensure a design of a high quality when provision is made for advanced surface fmishing of machined parts (notably the recuperator plate geometries), slight modifications to the design as well as stress relieving of machined components for the purpose of eliminating any residual stresses thatJnight be present.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{portable}} field-use testing system for conducting ASTM- 1550 - 05 round determinate panel tests. The test {{system can be}} used at the mine site to obtain shotcrete toughness strengths that are required for determining the support requirements for mine openings, minimizing falls of ground, and reducing mine roof-fall incidents. Background: When shotcrete is used {{as part of a}} ground support system in mining, {{it is important to know}} the placed strength of the shotcrete. The round determinate panel test (RDPT) was developed to quantify the resistance to tensile failure and toughness of fiber-reinforced shotcrete. The tension cracks produced by the RDPT represent the failure type observed in underground tunneling and mining. There are two design values obtained from the RDPT, the load profile and the energy. Both of these values are used when designing ground control for underground openings. While many methods have been tested for measuring strengths, RDPT is the preferred method for directly measuring determinate breaks and providing resultant toughness. Operating the Portable Round Determinate Panel Test System: Round panel samples are formed by spraying shotcrete into 75 x 800 -mm (3 x 31. 5 -in) mold rings. The upper surface of each panel is leveled with a screed to a <b>flatness</b> <b>tolerance</b> of within 5 mm (0. 2 in). Each sample must measure between 70 to 90 -mm (2. 75 to 3. 5 -in) high and 750 to 850 -mm (29. 5 to 33. 5 -in) in diameter, with correction factors available for variances. Three samples are usually made for each test interval, and tests are typically conducted after the shotcrete has cured for 7, 14, and 28 days. The portable RDPT system is a self-contained, closed-loop, servo-controlled, stiff-frame press. To conduct a test, a cured sample is positioned on three support pins centered below the test system's ram. After the ram is lowered to a position just above the sample, an automated test cycle is initiated by depressing the green start button, which initiates the test and also starts the data acquisition system. The ram is set at a stroke rate of 4. 00 mm/min (0. 16 in/min) as per ASTM specifications; a full test stroke is 45 mm (1. 77 in). During the test, the operator observes the sample for the development of three tension cracks. The cracks usually develop at less than 5 mm (0. 2 in) of ram displacement. After a full test stroke, the press head automatically retracts to unload the sample. The test specimen is then measured in 10 spots for thickness, and a relative fiber count is conducted on the broken face of the sample. Data for load and displacement is gathered using an Eaton data logger. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "June 2011. "Also available via the World Wide Web as an Acrobat. pdf file (747 KB, 2 p.).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{various aspects}} of optical disk data storage systems {{from the point of}} view of the irradiance and phase distributions at the exit pupil of the objective lens. The research topics were chosen in order to address some of the problems facing future generations of optical disk systems. Future optical disks will have a much greater areal data density, and will undoubtedly use a shorter wavelength in order to decrease the size of the optical stylus. The research in this dissertation examines some of the problems inherent in the move to shorter wavelengths. For example, at short wavelengths, the tolerance on acceptable disk tilt becomes tighter; disks must either be manufactured with a tighter <b>flatness</b> <b>tolerance,</b> or a system must be devised such that the problems caused by disk tilt are corrected inside the optical disk drive. (Such a system is described in Chapter 6.) The other topics in this dissertation address similar problems, all of which are essential for a more complete understanding of optical disk technology. After a brief introduction to the irradiance distribution at the exit pupil of the objective lens (typically called the baseball pattern), we describe a novel focusing/tracking technique. Many optical disk drives use the astigmatic technique, in which the baseball pattern is projected onto an astigmatic lens that focuses the beam onto a quadrant detector placed between the two line foci of the lens. We experimentally demonstrate that by projecting the baseball pattern onto a ring lens (i. e. a lens that focuses light to a ring rather than a single spot), we are able to produce steeper focus-error signals that are more resistant to feed-through (induced on the focus-error signal by track crossings during the seek operation) than the astigmatic technique. We then examine the effects of substrate birefringence and tilt on the irradiance and phase distributions at the exit pupil of the objective lens. The irradiance and phase patterns are calculated and experimentally verified for the cases of no substrate birefringence, birefringence aligned with the incident polarization, and birefringence aligned at 45 ° to the incident polarization. The irradiance at the exit pupil is also calculated and experimentally verified for a grooved substrate for various amounts of substrate tilt. We then examine two distinct effects that are dependent on the incident polarization direction. The first of these is the excitation of surface plasmons at the interface between the dielectric substrate (or air, if the optical disk's storage layer is air-incident) and the metallic thin films in the disk. These plasmons are responsible for dips in the zeroth order diffraction efficiency curves of a metal grating at certain angles of incidence. The dips appear as dark bands in the baseball pattern and are seen only when there is a component of incident polarization that lies perpendicular to the tracks. The location of these bands is derived from theoretical considerations and is shown to depend on the track pitch and the materials involved, but not on the groove depth or width. The band locations are confirmed by zeroth order diffraction efficiency measurements as a function of incident angle. A possible negative effect of these bands is the introduction of additional fluctuations and noise into the focusing and push-pull tracking signals. The second of the polarization-dependent effects concerns the differences in tracking performance with respect to the direction of the incident-light polarization. In optical disk storage systems, the signal that provides tracking information is dependent on the groove shape, the optical constants of the materials involved, and the polarization state of the incident light. We show that the tracking signals can be described by two measurable quantities, both of which are largely independent of aberrations in the optical system. Using these two quantities, we match the tracking performance of a given optical disk to an equivalent disk having rectangular grooves - the adjustable parameters being the rectangular groove depth and the duty cycle. By assumption, the rectangular grooves modulate only the phase of the incident beam and disregard its state of polarization. The effective groove depth and the duty cycle thus become dependent on the polarization state of the incident beam. We examine the dependencies for various disks having different groove geometries and different combinations of materials. Next, we use the baseball pattern as a diagnostic tool to develop and demonstrate the concepts of a servo system for the correction of disk tilt. Since disk tilt produces primarily coma in the beam focused onto the disk, the system uses a "variable coma generator" to produce and equal and opposite amount of coma as that caused by the tilted disk. The magnitude and direction of disk tilt are detected using the light reflected from the front facet of the disk substrate. Finally, we address a major obstacle in the construction of future generation optical disk testers - the use of shorter wavelengths and thinner substrates. A typical aspheric singlet used as the objective lens in optical disk data storage systems will not work at different wavelengths or with different substrate thicknesses, due to spherochromatism. Using two microscope objectives with adjustable collars and a pair of relay lenses, we have constructed a system in which a diffraction-limited spot of any wavelength in the range of 0. 4 μm - 0. 7 μm can be moved by as much as ± 1 00 μm in both the focusing and tracking directions. This is accomplished by simply moving an aspheric singlet mounted in an off-the-shelf optical head. The system uses the adjustable collars of the microscope objectives to correct for the spherochromatism of the singlet, and to accommodate the various thicknesses of the substrates...|$|E
40|$|The {{modelling}} of {{the friction}} interfaces has received much attention {{in recent years}} from the aerospace industry. In order to obtain reliable prediction of the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of the disc and blades in the aerospace engine the friction forces at interfaces, such as in under-platform dampers, blade and fir tree roots or shrouds, must be modelled accurately. Two contact parameters, namely the contact stiffness and the coefficient of friction, are sufficient to model, with good accuracy, the friction contact. The contact parameters are obtained experimentally, and are of interest for the designer only if representative of the operational environment of the engine. To pursue this aim a test rig {{has been designed to}} perform experiments {{in a wide range of}} temperatures, with different combinations of normal and tangential load, frequencies and mating materials, representative of the real operating condition of the engine. Most of the rigs found in literature perform most likely point contact even if the two bodies have plane mating surfaces. The design of a real plane-on-plane contact test rig is not an easy task but despite the difficulty a solution was found in the design shown in this work. The core of the rig is a tilting mechanism enabling one surface to lies down on the other so that the plane-on-plane contact is achieved, at least within the <b>flatness</b> geometrical <b>tolerance</b> of the surfaces. The results of the experiments are the hysteresis loops, namely the tangential contact force against the relative displacement, from which the contact parameters can be calculated.
