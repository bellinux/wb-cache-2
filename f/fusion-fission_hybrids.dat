40|$|After {{reviewing}} the long-standing tradition on hybrid research, an assessment model {{is presented in}} order to characterize the hybrid performance under different objectives. In hybrids, neutron multiplication in the subcritical blanket plays a major role, not only for energy production and nuclear breeding, but also for tritium breeding, which is fundamental requirement in <b>fusion–fission</b> <b>hybrids.</b> All three objectives are better achieved with high values of the neutron multiplication factor (k-eff) with the obvious and fundamental limitation that it cannot reach criticality under any event, particularly, {{in the case of}} a loss of coolant accident. This limitation will be very important in the selection of the coolant. Some general considerations will be proposed, as guidelines for assessing the hybrid potential in a given scenario. Those guidelines point out that hybrids can be of great interest for the future of nuclear energy in a framework of Sustainable Development, because they can contribute to the efficient exploitation of nuclear fuels, with very high safety features. Additionally, a proposal is presented on a blanket specially suited for <b>fusion–fission</b> <b>hybrids,</b> although this reactor concept is still under review, and new work is needed for identifying the most suitable blanket composition, which can vary depending on the main objective of the hybrid...|$|E

It was designed for a criticality keff <=  0. 95 in normal operation state.

40|$|Although {{the recent}} {{experiments}} and associated theoretical studies of fusion energy development {{have demonstrated the}} feasibility of fusion power, {{there will still be}} a long way to realize fusion energy application commercially and economically. On the other hand, the fission nuclear industry has been falling on hard times recently since so far there has been no conclusion {{about how to deal with}} the long-lived wastes produced from the nuclear spent fuel and about how to solve the shortage of natural uranium ore in addition to nuclear safety and proliferation. It is a natural way to develop fusion-fission hybrid reactors as an alternative strategy to speed up the time for producing energy since the fusion-fission hybrid systems/reactors have the potential attractiveness of good safety performance and plenty of fuel and easing the requirement of fusion plasma technology (with a low fusion gain Q) and plasma-facing material technology [1 - 3] (with a low neutron wall loading). As an intermediate step between fission energy application and fusion energy application, the fusion-fission hybrid reactors can be further utilized as a neutron source for R&D of fusion reactor itself [4]. 2. Design Activities of <b>Fusion-Fission</b> <b>Hybrids</b> The fusion-fission hybrid concept dates back to the earliest days of the fusion project when it was recognized that using fusion neutrons to breed fissile nuclear fuel would vastly increase the energy from the fusion plant. It appears to receive almost no attention since the mid 80 ’s in the world, except in China which has given very serious consideration and had strong hybrid reactor activities. Along with the ongoing efforts to establish fusion as an energy source, there has been a renewed interest in fusion neutron source applications. In addition to fundamental neutronics research, fusion research and development (R&D) activities are becoming of interest in nuclear fission powe...|$|E
40|$|With the {{completion}} of the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and upcoming ignition experiments, there is renewed interest in laser <b>fusion-fission</b> <b>hybrids</b> and pure fusion systems for base load power generation. An advantage of a laser fusion based system is that it would produce copious neutrons (~ 1. 8 x 10 20 /s for a 500 MW fusion source). This opens the door to hybrid systems with once through, high burn-up, closed fuel cycles. With abundant fusion neutrons, only modest fission gain (5 to 10) is needed for power production. Depleted uranium can be used as the fission fuel, effectively eliminating the need for uranium mining and enrichment. With high burn up, a hybrid would generate only 5 % to 10 % the volume of high-level nuclear waste per kilowatt hour that a once through light water reactor (LWR) does. Reprocessing is no longer needed to close the fuel cycle as the spent fuel can, after interim cooling, go directly to geologic disposal. While the depleted uranium fuel cycle offers advantages of simplicity and proliferation avoidance, it has the most challenging fuel lifetime requirements. Fissile fuel such as plutonium, or plutonium and minor actinides separated from spent nuclear fuel, would have roughly twice the fission gain and incur only about 25 % of the radiation damage to reach the same burn up level as depleted uranium. These missions are interesting in their own right and also provide an opportunity for early market entry of laser fusion based energy sources. A third fuel cycle option is to burn spent fuel directly, without prior separation of the plutonium and minor actinides. The neutronic and economic performance of this fuel cycle is very similar to the depleted uranium system. The primary difference is the need to fabricate new LIFE fuel from spent LWR fuel. The advantage of this fuel cycle is that it would burn the residual actinides in spent nuclear fuel, greatly reducing long term radio-toxicity and heat load, while avoiding the need to chemically separate spent LWR fuel...|$|E
40|$|Largely in {{anticipation}} of a possible nuclear renaissance, there has been an enthusiastic renewal of interest in the fusion-fission hybrid concept, driven primarily by some members of the fusion community. A fusion-fission hybrid consists of a neutron-producing fusion core surrounded by a fission blanket. Hybrids are of interest because of their potential to address the main long-term sustainability issues related to nuclear power: fuel supply, energy production, and waste management. As a result of this renewed interest, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), with the participation of the Office of Fusion Energy Sciences (OFES), Office of Nuclear Energy (NE), and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), organized a three-day workshop in Gaithersburg, Maryland, from September 30 through October 2, 2009. Participants identified several goals. At the highest level, it was recognized that DOE does not currently support any R&D in the area of <b>fusion-fission</b> <b>hybrids.</b> The question to be addressed was whether or not hybrids offer sufficient promise to motivate DOE to initiate an R&D program in this area. At the next level, the workshop participants were asked to define the research needs and resources required to move the fusion-fission concept forward. The answer to the high-level question was given in two ways. On the one hand, when viewed as a standalone concept, the fusion-fission hybrid does indeed offer the promise of being able to address the sustainability issues associated with conventional nuclear power. On the other hand, when participants were asked whether these hybrid solutions are potentially more attractive than contemplated pure fission solutions (that is, fast burners and fast breeders), there was general consensus that this question could not be quantitatively answered based on the known technical information. Pure fission solutions are based largely on existing both fusion and nuclear technology, thereby prohibiting a fair side-by-side comparison. Another important issue addressed at the conference was the time scale on which long-term sustainability issues must be solved. There was a wide diversity of opinion and no consensus was possible. One group, primarily composed of members of the fission community, argued that the present strategies with respect to waste management (on-site storage) and fuel supply (from natural uranium) would suffice for at least 50 years, with the main short-term problem being the economics of light water reactors (LWRs). Many from the fusion community believed that the problems, particularly waste management, were of a more urgent nature and that we needed to address them sooner rather than later. There was rigorous debate on all the issues before, during, and after the workshop. Based on this debate, the workshop participants developed a set of high-level Findings and Research Needs and a companion set of Technical Findings and Research Needs. In the context of the Executive Summary it is sufficient to focus on the high-level findings which are summarized...|$|E

40|$|The <b>fusion-fission</b> <b>hybrid</b> reactor is a {{promising}} {{technology that is}} likely to assume more and more importance in the global energy scenario in the coming years. Although this kind of nuclear system dates back to the earliest times of the fusion projects (when it was recognized that using fusion neutrons to “support” nuclear fission fuel cycle could widely increase the exploitation of the fusion plants), it appears to receive relatively limited attention since the mid- 1980 s. Notwithstanding, hybrid fusion fission systems have been already studied for some decades, in the most prominent laboratories and a relatively large bibliography was produced. Obviously much more papers on this topic have been published in more recent years. The <b>fusion-fission</b> <b>hybrid</b> concept can use both the nuclear fusion and fission processes: in a typical application, neutrons from fusion reactions can be used to sustain the fission chain of a sub-critical system. This is the basis of the hybrid reactor concept: neutron generation is not produced just in neutron-induced fissions, but also as a “by-product” of the fusion reactions inside the nuclear fusion reactor “core” (i. e., respectively, the void chamber for MCF or the fuel particles for ICF). This method allows to have an intrinsically safe facility (with a higher efficiency than a fusion reactor itself and a harder neutron energy spectrum than a fission reactor) which could be suitable for nuclear waste transmutation, too. In the last years, many initiatives on nuclear waste transmutation were proposed {{in order to reduce the}} long-term radiotoxicity of the wastes by eliminating a high fraction of the TRU from the SNF before their final disposal. In this frame, as already anticipated, <b>hybrid</b> <b>fusion-fission</b> systems could have an additional degree of freedom because of the independent source: this means that the neutron spectrum can be (reasonably) tailored for the transmutation purposes.
