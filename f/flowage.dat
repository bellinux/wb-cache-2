5|$|In {{southern}} Ontonagon County, {{the highway}} runs {{west of the}} Bond Falls <b>Flowage</b> near Paulding. North of here, the trunkline enters Bruce Crossing and intersects M-28. After leaving town, US45 runs northward parallel to the Middle Branch of the Ontonagon River, and the highway crosses the river near a roadside park south of Rockland. East of Rockland, US45 meets the southern terminus of M-26; after the intersection, US45 turns northwesterly and runs parallel to the Ontonagon River and {{a branch of the}} Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad (ELS).|$|E

The plane presents some hydrogeological problems related to previous <b>flowages</b> and salt water intrusion from the sea. The geophysical results verified the good resolution of the joint elaboration of the IP and the resistivity soundings, in order to delineate some hydrogeological aspects of the San Priamo coastal plane. In particular, the technique was suitable for detecting salt water intrusion in a fresh acquifer, with good reliability...|$|R
25|$|The {{primary program}} was {{wilderness}} canoe trips, through the {{lakes and rivers}} of northern Wisconsin and {{the southern edge of}} the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The base provided training, outfitting, and guiding for these trips as well as sleeping and meal facilities for groups of 6-12 crew members, including an adult leader, as they prepared to start or end canoe trips. They also provided transportation to and from starting and ending points. Training included an intensive Voyageur course for the youth leader of a group during the week prior to the group's trip. Additional programs for Scouts included whitewater trips on the lower Flambeau <b>Flowage,</b> swimming at the White Sand Lake beach, informal sandlot football and softball games between staff members and Scouts at the base, and winter camping in the cabins left by the CCC.|$|E

5000|$|Maine Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) are {{state owned}} lands {{managed by the}} Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. The WMAs {{comprise}} approximately 100,000 acres and contain a diverse array of habitats, from wetland <b>flowages</b> critical to waterfowl production to the spruce-fir forests of northern Maine on which Canada Lynx, moose and wintering deer are dependent. Spread geographically throughout all counties of the State the properties are available for a multitude of recreational opportunities, {{with a focus on}} hunting, fishing and trapping. The focus on offering these types of recreational opportunities is in line with the funding used to acquire such properties, historically accomplished with funding from Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration and State bonding approved by voters.|$|R
50|$|Several major rivers {{flow into}} the coast along the Eastern Shore, {{including}} the Musquodoboit River, which flows into the Musquodoboit Harbour, Jeddore Harbour, Tangier River, which flows from Tangier Grand Lake to the Atlantic, West River Sheet Harbour, which flows into the Northwest Arm of Sheet Harbour, as well as East River Sheet Harbour into the Northeast Arm. The St. Mary's River also flows into the Atlantic, passing through the community of Sherbrooke. There are many lakes, ponds, <b>flowages</b> {{and other types of}} freshwater bodies along the Eastern Shore. The largest of which are Porters Lake, which flows almost directly into the Atlantic Ocean, Lake Charlotte, which flows into Ship Harbour via the Ship Harbour River and Tangier Grand Lake, which flows into the Atlantic Ocean via the Tangier River.|$|R
5000|$|Approximately {{one third}} of the refuge is {{designated}} as federal wilderness. The two Wilderness Areas (one in each division) are part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. They are managed with a [...] "hands-off" [...] philosophy and granted special protection to maintain their primitive qualities. Internal combustion engines and mechanical means of transportation (i.e. bicycles) are not allowed. Habitat management is kept to a minimum to allow the areas to develop into old- growth climax forests. [...] Bald eagles, frequent both divisions of the refuge, feeding on fish in the streams, ponds, and <b>flowages.</b> In recent years, as many as three pairs of eagles have nested at Moosehorn NWR. Eagles are frequently sighted around Magurrewock Marsh on the Baring Division and along the shore of Dennys Bay on the Edmunds Division. Osprey nest in several of the refuge marshes with as many as four pairs using platforms along the Charlotte Road.|$|R
2500|$|The St. Croix River {{was one of}} the {{original}} eight rivers to have significant portions placed under protection by the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968. The upper reaches of the river in Wisconsin below the St. Croix <b>Flowage,</b> [...] downstream from its source, as well as the Namekagon River, are protected as the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway. The free-flowing nature of the river is interrupted only by a hydroelectric dam operated by the Northern States Power Company at St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin.|$|E
2500|$|Construction was {{scheduled}} to begin {{in the summer of}} 1929, but landowner George W. Kirk filed a lawsuit maintaining that he would be unable to sell his land or secure loans {{as a result of the}} floodway. Judge Charles B. Davis of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri ruled in favor of the government and denied an injunction. Construction of the setback levvee started in October 1929 and was completed in October 1932. Acquisition of the required <b>flowage</b> rights was not accomplished until January 1942.|$|E
50|$|East River Sheet Harbour {{begins at}} the Marshall <b>Flowage,</b> near Malay Falls. It flows {{southwest}} through the Malay Falls and Ruth Falls Flowages. Lake Mulgrave, a large lake west of the Marshall <b>Flowage,</b> flows into the Marshall <b>Flowage</b> via the Mulgrave River. The Fifteen Mile Stream also flows into the Marshall <b>Flowage</b> from the north. It extends northward, into Guysborough County. Grant River, a short river, flows into the Ruth Falls <b>Flowage.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to the significant frontage on the Isinglass River, the Hanson Lot supports myriad wetlands – vernal pools, beaver <b>flowages,</b> forested swamps, meadow marshes, and scrub-shrub wetlands. These are embedded within a hemlock – oak – beech - pine forest that was heavily logged in 1998. A {{plan to build a}} large 58 - to 70 -lot residential subdivision on the property was averted by the acquisition of the Hanson Lot as permanent conservation land. The Bedford property is also mostly wooded; the forest was carefully managed by previous owners and therefore retains a mix of tree species and ages. Together the properties are embedded within a 1, 800 -acre block of undeveloped lands that offers habitat for wide-ranging wildlife, protects water quality, and provides unique recreational experiences. A woods road runs through both properties, used by snowmobilers, hikers, mountain bikers, and horseback riders. The river corridor is a popular fishing destination...|$|R
40|$|Tropical rock {{varnishes}} {{found on}} Hualalai and Mauna Kea Volcanoes, Hawai'i, vary systematically {{with time and}} environment. Radiocarbon dating of encapsulated organic matter, (K+ + Ca 2 +) /Ti 4 + ratios, and Zn, Cu, and Ni trace element concentrations in rock varnish are consistent with lava <b>flowages</b> established by K-Ar and 14 C dating, where samples are collected from arid microsites {{well away from the}} soil surface. However, inaccurate ages are obtained from rock varnish in subsurface locations and from sites with abundant lichens, cyanobacteria, and fungi that chemically erode varnish. In contrast with continental deserts, Hawaiian varnishes commonly interfinger with and are less common than rock coatings of amorphous silica. Laboratory experiments on Hawaiian rock varnishes indicate that K and Ca are preferentially leached relative to Ti over time and at higher temperatures. The location of in situ leaching has been identified in Hawaiian varnishes as porous textures without abundant detrital grains...|$|R
5000|$|The Clam River {{and some}} of its tributaries are listed as Class I trout streams, a {{category}} reserved by the Wisconsin DNR for [...] "high quality trout waters that have sufficient natural reproduction to sustain populations of wild trout, at or near carry capacity." [...] Most of the best trout fishing can be found on public land within 5 to 10 mi of the headwaters. Several warmer water species can also be found in the river and the lakes and <b>flowages</b> it traverses. Typically, the river is navigable by canoe or kayak for most of its course, though parts of the river are prone to snags. The number of snags in the river increased greatly on July 1, 2011, when a windstorm yielding hurricane-force gusts caused extensive damage {{in the vicinity of the}} river. [...] This storm knocked down thousands of acres of forest, and a significant number of trees fell directly into the river.|$|R

5|$|Aquatic life ties North American river otters almost {{exclusively}} to permanent watersheds. The river otters favor bog lakes with banked shores containing semiaquatic mammal burrows and lakes with beaver lodges. The otters avoid water bodies with gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel. In Maine, use of watersheds by river otters is negatively associated with the proportion of mixed hardwood-softwood stands in forested areas adjacent to waterways. However, it is positively associated {{with the number of}} beaver <b>flowages,</b> watershed length, and average shoreline diversity. In Idaho, river otters prefer valley habitats over mountainous terrain, and they select valley streams over valley lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. Log jams are heavily used when present. In Florida, inhabitation of North American river otters is lowest in freshwater marshes, intermediate in salt marshes, and highest in swamp forests. During the dry season, they will recede from the marshland and move to permanent ponds, where water is available and food is in greater supply. In Idaho and Massachusetts, ecological elements preferred for latrine sites include large conifers, points of land, beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, mouths of permanent streams, or any object that protrudes from the water.|$|R
3000|$|Brigham et al. (2009) {{indicated}} that atmospheric deposition {{was the source}} of mercury along streams, and characteristics of the streams basins appeared as important factors for transforming total (elemental) Hg into the methylated form (MeHg) thereby making it more available to aquatic food bases. Further, the research team showed that streams with greater drainage basins along with more wetlands had the highest pore water dissolved organic carbon; the latter an indicator where methylation of mercury is enhanced (Marvin-Di Pasquale et al. (2009). Their results also showed that Hg-contamination at higher trophic levels of fish in streams was likely dominated by the MeHg available {{at the base of the}} food chain (or web) rather that the trophic position of the predator fish species (Chasar et al. 2009). In the Fountain Creek watershed, it is possible that in upper reaches of the two streams that confluence (upper Fountain and Monument Creek), could favor more methylation of total mercury by microbial activity in the wetlands and marshes of the tributaries in the upper basin rather than in the lower. There are about 18 intermittent or permanent tributaries emptying into upper Fountain Creek basin and about 20 tributaries in Monument Creek. By contrast, lower Fountain Creek is mainly a “shifting, shallow sandy-bottom plains-stream” with scattered wetlands and marshes present only in still-water oxbows, scoured by previous high-water and flood conditions. The biological contents of the wetlands only enter the main stream <b>flowages</b> during the next flood event. Clearly, we cannot identify point- and nonpoint-sources of Hg entering the relatively small Fountain Creek watershed in Colorado, but at this juncture, we agree with Peterson et al. (2007) that it appears likely much of the Hg in fish is from atmospheric deposition both local and sources to the west. We have noted that Obrist et al. (2008) have affirmed the following, “not surprisingly, contributions are modeled to be highest in the western U.S. with Asian sources accounting for 27  % of measured mercury depositions in Colorado, for example.” [...]...|$|R
