25|$|One very {{successful}} example {{of virtual reality}} therapy exposure therapy is the PTSD treatment system, Virtual Iraq. Using a <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>display</b> and a game pad, patients navigate a Humvee around virtual recreations of Iraq, Afghanistan, and the United States. By being safely exposed to the traumatic environments, patients learned to reduce their anxiety. According to {{a review of the}} history of Virtual Iraq, one study found that it reduced PTSD symptoms by an average of fifty percent, and disqualified over seventy-five percent of participants for PTSD after treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Virtual reality (VR) is a {{technology}} which allows a user {{to interact with}} a computer-simulated environment. Most current virtual reality environments are primarily visual experiences, displayed either {{on a computer screen}} or through special or stereoscopic displays, but some simulations include additional sensory information, such as sound through speakers or headphones. In 1968, Ivan Sutherland, {{with the help of his}} student Bob Sproull, invented what is widely considered to be the first virtual reality and augmented reality (AR) <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>display</b> (HMD) system. It was primitive both in terms of user interface and realism, and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy it had to be suspended from the ceiling, and the graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple wireframe model rooms. In 1989, Jaron Lanier, the founder of VPL Research popularized the concept of virtual reality with his [...] "google n' gloves" [...] system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—With {{the recent}} {{introduction}} of low cost <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>displays</b> (HMDs), prices of HMD-based virtual reality setups dropped considerably. In various application areas personal <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>displays</b> can be utilized {{for groups of}} users to deliver different context sensitive information to individual users. We present a hardware setup that allows attaching 12 or more HMDs to a single PC. Finally we demonstrate how a collaborative, educational, augmented reality application is used by six students wearing HMDs on a single PC simultaneously with interactive framerates. Index Terms—Augmented reality, <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>displays,</b> multi-user applications, virtual reality. I...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, there have been {{striking}} developments in wearable computing. Among all the different forms of wearable devices, <b>Head</b> <b>Mounted</b> <b>Displays</b> (HMDs) are deemed the first seamless solution to enabling workers with real time contextual information and allowing companies to integrate with existing back-end systems. The hands-free feature that come along with the HMDs is also believed a great advantage over many traditional technologies.

40|$|<b>Head</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>displays</b> are {{characterized}} by relatively low resolution and low dynamic range. These limitations significantly reduce the visual quality of photo-realistic captures on such displays. This thesis presents an interactive view optimized tone mapping technique for viewing large sized high dynamic range panoramas up to 16384 by 8192 on <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>displays.</b> This technique generates a separate file storing pre-computed view-adjusted mapping function parameters. We define this technique as ToneTexture. The use of a view adjusted tone mapping allows for expansion of the perceived color space available to the end user. This yields an improved visual appearance of both high dynamic range panoramas and low dynamic range panoramas on such displays. Moreover, by providing proper interface to manipulate on ToneTexture, users are allowed to adjust the mapping function as to changing color emphasis. The authors present comparisons of the results produced by ToneTexture technique against widely-used Reinhard tone mapping operator and Filmic tone mapping operator both objectively via a mathematical quality assessment metrics and subjectively through user study. Demonstration systems are available for desktop and <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>displays</b> such as Oculus Rift and GearVR...|$|R
