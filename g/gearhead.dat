5000|$|<b>Gearhead</b> first {{appeared}} in the The Batman episode [...] "RPM" [...] voiced by Will Friedle. In this version, <b>Gearhead</b> (Nathan Finch) is a criminal car racer, who operates with advanced forms of nanotechnology. Like in the comics he is a cyborg, as the Batman says, [...] "He doesn't control nanotechnology; he is nanotechnology". His right arm has cords that transmit some kind of nanotechnological virus which infects the vehicle and alters it into a more hi-tech form with advanced features and his signature yellow and black colour scheme. His fingertips can extend to form claws when he is engaged in combat. His right arm bears certain shells of the nanotechnological virus, which he can fire at other vehicles and control them remotely. Also, he has a robotic right eye that can automatically guide and maneuver his vehicle through traffic and other obstructions for him. <b>Gearhead</b> first shows up in a yellow race car during a charity race that Bruce Wayne is also competing in. <b>Gearhead</b> wins the race and steals all the charity money and rides off, leaving all the contestants baffled. Soon after, he ends up getting chased by the Batman in his Batmobile. However, <b>Gearhead</b> appears to be too fast for the Batman, and later the Batman eventually loses control of the Batmobile and falls off a cliff. He manages to jump in time, but the Batmobile is destroyed. Later, at the Batcave, Wayne builds a new Batmobile with upgraded parts from other prototypes in his possession, from Wayne Industries technology and even from the nanotechnological shell that he recovered from a vehicle that <b>Gearhead</b> was controlling. With a bigger and better vehicle, the Batman, along with the Batgirl, outraces <b>Gearhead</b> and defeats him. When he tries to steal the new Batmobile by injecting his cords into it, he is electrocuted, as the Batman tells that he reversed the effects of the virus so that it can't infect his vehicle. <b>Gearhead</b> is then sent to jail. <b>Gearhead</b> is later seen in [...] "Rumors" [...] as one of the villains captured by Rumor. Aside from his bionics, Gearhead's appearance is altered, donning a yellow racing outfit (albeit with a visorless helmet), a black stripe down the middle of each part and grey, and metal fingers on his left glove (his right arm is sleeveless and the hand on that arm is bare-handed).|$|E
