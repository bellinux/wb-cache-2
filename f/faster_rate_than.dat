5|$|After {{experiencing}} {{fluctuations in}} the decades immediately after the independence of India, the economies of South Indian states have registered growth {{higher than the national}} average over the past three decades. While South Indian states have improved in some of the socio-economic metrics, poverty continues to affect the region as it does the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years. Basis the 2011 census, HDI in the southern states is high and the economy has grown at a <b>faster</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> most northern states.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Tephrosia apollinea are deep, {{penetrating}} soils {{to a depth}} of 3 metres or more, aiding the absorption of moisture from the soil. Moisture is stored in the cortex of the roots, which is protected by a thin periderm. Water storage in the cortex enables growth and reproduction during times of drought, which allow it to thrive in both arid and semi-arid conditions and to survive during winter and summer months at times of low rainfall. The roots grow at a <b>faster</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> the shoots themselves, and even at the early stage of the plant displaying a shoot the length of a cm, the roots may already be 30cm or more in length.|$|E
5|$|Larger bodied {{specimens}} of Dimetrodon have larger sails {{relative to their}} size, an example of positive allometry. Positive allometry may benefit thermoregulation because it means that, as individuals get larger, surface area increases faster than mass. Larger-bodied animals generate {{a great deal of}} heat through metabolism, and the amount of heat that must be dissipated from the body surface is significantly greater than what must be dissipated by smaller-bodied animals. Effective heat dissipation can be predicted across many different animals with a single relationship between mass and surface area. However, a 2010 study of allometry in Dimetrodon found a different relationship between its sail and body mass: the actual scaling exponent of the sail was much larger than the exponent expected in an animal adapted to heat dissipation. The researchers concluded that the sail of Dimetrodon grew at a much <b>faster</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> was necessary for thermoregulation, and suggested that sexual selection was the primary reason for its evolution.|$|E

5|$|Paleoclimatologists {{measure the}} ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to {{determine}} the climate {{millions of years ago}} (see oxygen isotope ratio cycle). Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly <b>faster</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> water molecules containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18, and this disparity increases at lower temperatures. During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18. Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate. Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years.|$|E
5|$|Simulations suggest that, {{while the}} disk had a {{relatively}} high mass at any given moment, over time a substantial fraction (several tenths of a percent) {{of the mass of}} Jupiter captured from the solar nebula was passed through it. However, only 2% the proto-disk mass of Jupiter is required to explain the existing satellites. Thus there may have been several generations of Galilean-mass satellites in Jupiter's early history. Each generation of moons might have spiraled into Jupiter, because of drag from the disk, with new moons then forming from the new debris captured from the solar nebula. By the time the present (possibly fifth) generation formed, the disk had thinned so that it no longer greatly interfered with the moons' orbits. The current Galilean moons were still affected, falling into and being partially protected by an orbital resonance with each other, which still exists for Io, Europa, and Ganymede. Ganymede's larger mass means that it would have migrated inward at a <b>faster</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> Europa or Io.|$|E
5|$|The Mendelian and biometrician {{models were}} {{eventually}} reconciled {{with the development}} of population genetics. A key step was the work of the British biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher. In a series of papers starting in 1918 and culminating in his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, Fisher showed that the continuous variation measured by the biometricians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes, and that natural selection could change gene frequencies in a population, resulting in evolution. In a series of papers beginning in 1924, another British geneticist, J. B. S. Haldane, applied statistical analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as the evolution of industrial melanism in peppered moths, and showed that natural selection worked at an even <b>faster</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> Fisher assumed.|$|E

5|$|During 1928–1973, the Soviet Union {{was growing}} {{economically}} {{at a pace}} that would eventually catch up with the United States and Western Europe. This was true despite the advantage the United States had — the USSR was hampered by the effects of World War II, which had left most of Western USSR in ruins. In 1973, the process of catching up {{with the rest of the}} West came to an abrupt end, and 1973 was seen by some scholars as the start of the Era of Stagnation. The beginning of the stagnation coincided with a financial crisis in Western Europe and the U.S. By the early 1970s, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest industrial capacity, and produced more steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and tractors than any other country. Before 1973, the Soviet economy was expanding at <b>faster</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> that of the American economy (albeit by a very small margin). The USSR also kept a steady pace with the economies of Western Europe. Between 1964 and 1973, the Soviet economy stood at roughly half the output per head of Western Europe and a little more than one third that of the U.S.|$|E

5|$|Transport in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was an {{important}} part of the nation's economy. The economic centralisation of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure at a massive scale and rapid pace. Before the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, there were a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air. However, because of government policies before, during and after the Era of Stagnation, investments in transport were low. By the late 1970s and early 1980s Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the strain from the railways and to improve the state budget. The Civil aviation industry, represented by Aeroflot, was the largest in the world, but inefficiencies plagued it until the USSR's collapse. The road network remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities. At the same time, the attendance of the few roads they had were ill-equipped to handle this growing problem. By the late-1980s, after the death of Leonid Brezhnev, his successors tried, without success, to solve these problems. At the same time, the automobile industry was growing at a <b>faster</b> <b>rate</b> <b>than</b> the construction of new roads. By the mid-1970s, only 0.8 percent of the Soviet population owned a car.|$|E

MethodsWe examine longitudinal rates of change from baseline in 398 MCI subjects (141 females and 257 males) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative- 1, followed for up to 8  years (mean, 4. 1  ±  2. 5  years) using mixed-effects models incorporating all follow-ups (mean, 8  ±  4 visits). ResultsWomen progressed at <b>faster</b> <b>rates</b> <b>than</b> men on the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog; P = . 001) and clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes (CDR-SB; P = . 003). Quadratic fit for change over time was significant for both ADAS-Cog (P = . 001) and CDR-SB (P = . 004), and the additional acceleration in women was 100 % for ADAS-Cog and 143 % for CDR-SB. The variability of change was greater in women. The gender effect was greater in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε 4 carriers. DiscussionWomen with MCI have greater longitudinal rates of cognitive and functional progression than men. Studies to confirm and uncover potential mechanisms appear to be warranted.
