We present a linear time algorithm for the deduction for the <b>interiors</b> <b>and</b> {{show that it}} is co-NP-complete for the deduction for the exteriors. Under model-based representation, we show that the deduction problem for interiors is NP-complete while the one for exteriors is co-NP-complete. As for Horn envelopes of the exteriors, we show that it is linearly solvable under model-based representation, while it is co-NP-complete under formula-based representation. We also discuss the polynomially solvable cases for all the intractable problems...|$|R
