He joined Somerset as one of their first professionals in 1880, but was forced to miss most of 1881 while he qualified for the county. He was the most productive bowler for the county in their first two years of first-class cricket, but the emergence of E. W.

5|$|Hobbs {{was summoned}} to Surrey for a trial in April 1903, and {{subsequently}} offered {{a contract with the}} <b>ground</b> <b>staff</b> at the Oval on a basic wage during the season of 30 shillings a week. Hobbs could not immediately play for Surrey owing to the qualification rules in place at the time for the County Championship—a player had to be born in a county or to have lived there for two years in order to represent it. To achieve qualification, he moved to the Surrey area of London. Around this time he played football for local teams as a forward with some success, but struggled financially during the winter months and found it hard to find employment.|$|E

He found these duties dull, so auditioned for Squadron Leader Ralph Reader's RAF Gang Show entertainment troupe: Reader accepted him and Sellers toured the UK before the troupe was transferred to India. His tour also included Ceylon and Burma, although the duration of his stay in Asia is unknown, and Sellers may have exaggerated its length. He also served in Germany and France after the war.|$|E

5|$|In the {{practice}} nets, the county players towered over Larwood; the veteran Test batsman George Gunn {{thought he looked}} more like a jockey than a cricketer. At first he bowled badly, and his efforts were unimpressive. As his confidence increased his bowling improved, and committee members began to revise their initial dismissive judgement; when the session ended, Larwood was offered a playing contract. He accepted instantly; the terms were 32 shillings (£1.60) per week—the same as his mining wages—and he was expected, when not playing, to carry out <b>ground</b> <b>staff</b> duties. Robert Larwood was angry that his son had not asked for more generous terms, but according to Hamilton, Harold would have agreed to anything to escape from the mine, even for a single summer.|$|E
5|$|As part of No.9 Group's {{contribution}} to the Admiralty Islands campaign, No.73 Wing took up garrison duties at Los Negros commencing in March 1944. Its complement of combat squadrons was again Nos.76, 77 and 79 Squadrons, supported by No.49 Operational Base Unit, No.114 Mobile Fighter Sector, No.27 Air Stores Park and No.26 Medical Clearing Station, among other ancillaries, with total <b>ground</b> <b>staff</b> numbering approximately 900. The fighters' primary duty was providing air cover for Allied shipping; they also carried out bomber escort, ground attack and anti-shipping missions in the region. In mid-April, the wing escorted the largest Allied convoy in the South-West Pacific to that date, 80 ships carrying 30,000 personnel, from Finschhafen to Aitape. Completing its garrison work in the Admiralties that June, No.73 Wing was disbanded at Los Negros on 29August 1944. Its combat units were all eventually transferred to other formations under No.10 Operational Group (later renamed the Australian First Tactical Air Force). Nos.76 and 77 Squadrons joined another Kittyhawk unit, No.82 Squadron, at No.81 Wing on Noemfoor under Steege's command, while No.79 Squadron was withdrawn to Darwin in November to re-equip with new Spitfires before joining No.80 Wing and returning to the Pacific at Morotai in March 1945.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} RAAF's {{reorganisation}} {{following the}} outbreak of World WarII, No.1 Group was formed under Wrigley's command in Melbourne on 20November 1939, to oversee the operations of air bases and units in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. Promoted air commodore, in 1940 Wrigley served as Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Southern Area, the successor organisation to No.1 Group, before taking up the position of Air Member for Personnel (AMP) in November that year. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1941 New Year Honours. As AMP, Wrigley's responsibilities included organising the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF), established on 25March 1941 as the first uniformed women's branch of an armed service in the country. He believed that recruiting servicewomen was essential to augment the many <b>ground</b> <b>staff</b> required to support the war effort, and considered that while such an organisation should be constitutionally separate from the RAAF, its members should be closely integrated within the current force structure.|$|E
50|$|The airline {{operated}} scheduled daily flights between Male' and Colombo {{six times}} a week, with maintenance work being carried out on the seventh day. A domestic service was also commenced, with a fortnightly flight between Male' and Gan.

40|$|Scheduling of airport <b>ground</b> service <b>staff</b> is {{critical}} to airline ground operations. When scheduling <b>ground</b> service <b>staff,</b> as well as flight crew, airlines use published flight schedules as primary inputs to determine the manpower demand {{at different times of}} a day. Flight delays, which are part of actual flight operations and cannot be fully avoided by airlines, are usually not considered during the scheduling stage. In actual flight operations, however, the presence of flight delays will create disruptions to flight operations, thus affecting the scheduling of <b>ground</b> service <b>staff.</b> Using Integer Programming (IP), this study compared the manpower plan made during the planning stage and the actual manpower plan as required on the day of operations to quantitatively assess discrepancies between the two plans. The comparison will enable airlines to understand the impact of flight delays on ground operations more accurately. Results of the present study will also be used as a basis to build a robust manpower scheduling plan for airport <b>ground</b> service <b>staff,</b> which will mitigate the impact of flight delays on ground operations...|$|R

5|$|Established on 25 March 1941 in {{response}} to lobbying by women wanting {{to serve in the}} war, and to free more male ground crew for overseas postings, the WAAAF was the first uniformed women's branch of an armed service in Australia, predating similar organisations in the Army and Navy. Fewer than two hundred personnel had been recruited when Stevenson became Director in June; this number would grow to around a thousand {{by the end of the}} year. For the first three months of its existence the WAAAF had been under the temporary command of Flight Officer Mary Bell, wife of an RAAF group captain and former Australian Commandant of the Women's Air Training Corps, an organisation of female pilots and <b>ground</b> <b>staff</b> that had been formed in 1939 and had been providing voluntary support to the Air Force. Bell chose to resign on learning of Stevenson's appointment, rather than stay on as Deputy Director and report to someone from outside the service fraternity; she later rejoined at Wrigley's request, on the condition that she would receive no promotion higher than flight officer.|$|E
5|$|No.1 ITS's inaugural {{commanding}} officer was Wing Commander Wilfred Lampe. Tiger Moths began arriving at Archerfield on 4January 1952, {{and the first}} course commenced two days later. It graduated on 27March, having flown a total of some 1,000 hours. The unit was renamed No.1 Initial Flying Training School on 28May. As well as RAAF pilots, the school trained students from the Royal Australian Navy's Fleet Air Arm, and gave Air Training Corps cadets flying experience. Six of its Tiger Moths went on a recruiting drive around Kingaroy and Bundaberg in August 1952, the same month that its first graduates commenced {{the next phase of}} their training at No.1 BFTS. Those students selected to be navigators rather than pilots went on to the School of Air Navigation at RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria. No.1 IFTS was responsible for staging aerial pageants as part of Air Force Week in September 1952, and again in September 1953. <b>Ground</b> <b>staff</b> from the school won the Hewitt Trophy for small arms proficiency held at Liverpool, New South Wales, in December 1953.

5|$|On 27 September 1965, Minister for Air Peter Howson {{announced}} that No.37 Squadron {{was to be}} re-raised to operate twelve Lockheed C-130E Hercules transport aircraft that had been purchased by the Federal government; the new aircraft would allow the RAAF to support Australian deployments in South East Asia while continuing to meet its domestic commitments. The squadron was formed at RAAF Base Richmond on 21February 1966, {{under the command of}} Wing Commander Ron McKimm. It joined No.36 Squadron, which had been operating C-130A Hercules since 1958. No.486 Squadron, disbanded in 1964, was re-formed at Richmond to provide maintenance for both Hercules squadrons; major repairs and upgrades to the C-130s were the responsibility of No.2 Aircraft Depot (later No.503 Wing). As the C-130E had a longer range and could carry a greater payload than the C-130A, No.37 Squadron was generally assigned strategic tasks, while No.36 Squadron's responsibilities were primarily tactical in nature. No.37 Squadron began taking delivery of its C-130Es in August, {{and by the end of}} September its staff numbered eighty-six, including twenty-one officers. In February 1967, the squadron commenced long-range missions in support of Australian forces in the Vietnam War, including aero-medical evacuations conveying wounded soldiers back to Australia, generally via RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia. Initially both C-130A and Emodels were employed for such evacuations, but only C-130Es were assigned to this task from May 1967, as they offered more comfortable conditions and were capable of flying directly between South Vietnam and Australia if required. By the end of February 1968, No.37 Squadron had a strength of 207 personnel: eighty-five aircrew, including fifty-one officers, and 122 <b>ground</b> <b>staff,</b> including three officers. The squadron transported the last Australian forces out of Vietnam in December 1972, following the Federal government's decision to withdraw from the conflict.|$|E

5|$|On 8 February 1915, the Australian {{government}} {{received a}} request from the British Government of India for aerial assistance in the campaign against the Turks in Mesopotamia. Aircrew and supporting personnel for half a flight only were available so the unit, the AFC's first to see active service, {{became known as the}} Mesopotamian Half Flight. Promoted to captain, Petre was appointed the Half Flight's commanding officer and embarked for Basra via Bombay on 14April, later to be joined by fellow pilots White, Merz and Lieutenant William Treloar, along with thirty-seven <b>ground</b> <b>staff.</b> In Mesopotamia, Petre was required to lead the AFC contingent in reconnaissance and sabotage missions, and had to deal with unreliable machines, hazardous terrain, and the threat of incarceration or death at the hands of hostile tribesmen. He took part in operations in the Amara area from 31May to 4June, for which he was mentioned in despatches. The obsolete aircraft supplied by the Indian Government, two Maurice Farman Shorthorns and a Maurice Farman Longhorn, were only capable of top speeds of 50mph (80km/h), while the desert wind (known as the shamal) could reach 80mph (129km/h), meaning that the aircraft often made no headway or were simply blown backwards. In July, the Half Flight's equipment was augmented by two Caudron G.3 aircraft, a marginal improvement on the Farmans, but still prone to mechanical failure. Later that month, one of the Caudrons was forced to land in enemy territory. Its crew, Merz and a New Zealander, were never seen again; they were later reported killed by Arabs after a running gun battle over several miles.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} Test {{debut in the}} first match of the Ashes series at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. He took match figures of 2/65, his first wicket being Jack Hobbs, and in his first Test innings as a batsman, he hit the first ball for a {{boundary}} but was dismissed off the next ball, before scoring 49 in the second innings as Australia chased 428 for victory. McCabe and Don Bradman were scoring quickly and had taken the score to 3/229 when McCabe lofted Maurice Tate towards mid-on. Syd Copley, {{a member of the}} <b>ground</b> <b>staff</b> who was acting as a substitute fielder dived forward and took a difficult catch. McCabe's dismissal sparked a collapse of 7/104 as England took a 93-run win. McCabe scored 44 and an unbeaten 25 as Australia squared the series with a seven-wicket triumph in the Second Test at Lords. McCabe made 30 in a rain-affected draw in the Third Test, before scoring four and taking 4/41 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford, removing Ranjitsinhji, Maurice Leyland, Maurice Tate and Ian Peebles to reduce England to 8/251 in another wash out. With the series locked at 11, the Fifth and final Test at The Oval was a timeless Test. McCabe scored his first Test half-century of 54 as Australia piled on 695 to win by an innings and reclaim the Ashes 21. McCabe took one wicket in the deciding match, bowling leading English batsman Wally Hammond for 13. In all, McCabe scored 210 runs at 35.00 and took eight wickets at 27.62 in the Tests, and aggregated 1012 runs at 32.64 and took 26 wickets at 27.80 for the whole tour. This made him the fifth highest run-scorer for the tour. However, he was unable to register a century on tour, his highest score being 96. He continued his habit of failing to convert his starts into centuries in the tour matches after the start of the Tests. In one stretch of eight county innings, he registered scores between 34 and 79 seven times, and he ended with seven fifties for the tour. Nevertheless, Wisden praised his attacking ability to disrupt the length of opposition bowlers. On two occasions, McCabe took more than two wickets in an innings.|$|E
