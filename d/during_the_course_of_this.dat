5|$|The Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) {{attack on}} Nazareth was made {{possible}} by the British Empire infantry attack on 19 September which began the Battle of Sharon. The EEF infantry attacked along an almost continuous front from the Mediterranean Sea, across the Plain of Sharon and into the Judean Hills. The XXI Corps's British Indian Army infantry captured Tulkarm and the headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> attack, the infantry created a gap in the Ottoman front line defences through which the Desert Mounted Corps rode northwards to begin the cavalry phase of the battle. Subsequently, the infantry also captured Tabsor, Et Tire and Arara to outflank the Eighth Army. Meanwhile, the Desert Mounted Corps advanced to capture the communications hubs of Afulah, Beisan and Jenin on 20 September, cutting the main Ottoman withdrawal routes along their lines of supply and communications.|$|E

Caesar had earlier made an agreement with this tribe, to the effect that ten thousand men would protect his line of supplies. Vercingetorix convinced the chief Convictolitavis—who had previously been made chief of this tribe by Caesar—to order these same men to join him upon their arrival at the oppidum. They attacked the Romans who were accompanying their supply train, leaving Caesar in an embarrassing position.|$|E
25|$|Relations between Huerta and Madero grew {{strained}} <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> campaign when Pancho Villa, {{the commander}} of the División del Norte, refused orders from General Huerta. Huerta ordered Villa's execution, but Madero commuted the sentence and Villa was sent to the same Santiago Tlatelolco prison as Reyes from which he escaped on Christmas Day 1912. Angry at Madero's commutation of Villa's sentence, Huerta, after a long night of drinking, mused about reaching an agreement with Orozco and together deposing Madero as president. When Mexico's Minister of War learned of General Huerta's comments, he stripped Huerta of his command, but Madero intervened and restored Huerta to command.|$|E

25|$|During {{the next}} four years Yaroslav waged a {{complicated}} and bloody war for Kiev against his half-brother Sviatopolk I of Kiev, who was supported by his father-in-law, Duke Bolesław I Chrobry of Poland. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> struggle, several other brothers (Boris, Gleb, and Svyatoslav) were brutally murdered. The Primary Chronicle accused Svyatopolk of planning those murders, while the saga Eymundar þáttr hrings is often interpreted as recounting the story of Boris' assassination by the Varangians in the service of Yaroslav. However, the victim's name is given there as Burizaf, which is also a name of Boleslaus I in the Scandinavian sources. It is thus possible that the Saga tells the story of Yaroslav's struggle against Svyatopolk (whose troops were commanded by the Polish duke), and not against Boris.|$|E
25|$|It was <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{battle that}} Keysor {{performed}} {{the actions that}} led to him receiving the Victoria Cross. Early {{in the morning on}} 6 August 1915 the 1st Battalion carried out a diversionary attack at Lone Pine and after heavy fighting that lasted almost the entire day they managed to capture the Turkish trenches. After this more fighting would continue around the position for the next three days as the Turks attempted to regain the position. The fighting was carried out at close range, using bayonets and improvised grenades and bombs. Over the course of about 50 hours on 7–8 August, Keysor continually risked his life to pick up the Turkish grenades as they were thrown into the trenches and throw them back. Later, despite being wounded and ordered to seek medical attention, Keysor continued to remain in the line, volunteering to throw bombs for another company.|$|E
25|$|On the November 26 {{episode of}} Impact!, B.G. brought Kip and the 3Live Kru to ringside and asked Killings and Konnan whether Kip could join the stable. Following a heated {{argument}} between Konnan and B.G., both Killings and Konnan gave their approval, and the 4Live Kru was born. However, at Turning Point, Konnan attacked both B.G. and Kip, costing them their match against Team Canada and initiating a feud {{between himself and}} the remainder of the Kru. Shortly thereafter, B.G. James's father, Bob Armstrong, attempted to reconcile the group, but was instead attacked by Konnan and his new stablemates, Apolo and Homicide. Killings later stated that he had severed his ties with the Kru. With Konnan and Killings no longer members of the Kru, Kip and B.G. began referring to themselves as The James Gang and continued to feud with the Konnan-managed Latin American Exchange, whose third man position as Homicide's partner would switch from Apolo to Machete, and then from him to Hernandez, who finally stuck, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> feud.|$|E

25|$|Ryan {{then spent}} the rest of the summer on another preaching tour, this time in the company of his Provincial Superior. Conflict arose <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> tour as the {{superior}} felt that Ryan's preaching was not fully spiritually centered and Ryan felt the criticism keenly. As a new priest, he then was assigned to teach theology at St. Mary's of the Barrens and was also listed in 1860-61 on the faculty roster of St. Vincent's College in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, the first school of higher learning west of the Mississippi and the forerunner of De Paul University in Chicago, the nation's largest Catholic university. Frequent bouts of illness, however, kept him confined to bed until the following spring. It was at that time that the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln took place. Ryan was so incensed at being called by the same name as the new president, whom he despised, that he began to use the shortened version by which he had been called as a boy, the form by which he became known in history.|$|E
25|$|A {{decline in}} giant {{trevally}} numbers around inhabited regions {{has been well}} documented in Hawaii, with both catch data as presented above and ecological studies showing this decrease in numbers. A biomass study in the Hawaiian Islands indicates the main Hawaiian Islands are heavily depleted in the species, which in untouched ecosystems comprises 71% of the apex predator biomass. In contrast, it comprises less than 0.03% of the apex biomass in exploited habitats, with only a single fish observed <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> research study. Prior to this, a 1993 report suggested the population around the main Hawaiian islands were not stressed, though several biological indicators suggested to the contrary. This was due to the highly size-selective nature of the fishery, which theoretically should prevent a decrease in numbers. Despite this, populations have decreased, and in light of their continued falling abundance in Hawaii, several recommendations, including banning the commercial take of the species, increasing minimum lengths and decreasing bag limits for anglers, as well as reassessment of protected areas for the species, have been proposed by officials. The species (nor any other carangid) has not been assessed by the IUCN.|$|E
25|$|With the {{assistance}} of Hawke (the protagonist of Dragon Age II) and the one to accidentally release him from an ancient prison, the Inquisitor investigates {{the disappearance of the}} Grey Wardens, discovering that they were being manipulated by Corypheus into raising a demon army, and binding their mages to Corypheus's will. Hawke and the Inquisitor are assisted by a Grey Warden character from the previous games in the series, who may be either Alistair, Loghain, or Stroud, depending on choices made in previous games. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> quest, the Inquisitor reenters the Fade and regains memories of the Conclave, which reveal that the Inquisitor obtained the anchor upon coming into contact with Corypheus's magic orb, after stumbling on a ritual carried out by enthralled Grey Wardens to unlock the orb's power. Either Hawke or the Grey Warden gives their life to help the others escape the Fade, and the Inquisitor must decide whether to recruit the remaining Grey Wardens or exile them from Orlais. The Inquisitor also attends a ball at the Winter Palace, either interrupts or allows Corypheus' plot to assassinate Empress Celene, and resolves the ongoing civil war in Orlais. Morrigan, an advisor to the Empress, joins the Inquisition as Imperial liaison.|$|E

25|$|Beaufort was {{believed}} to be held by between 800 and 1,000 Japanese troops and on 27 June, the Australians attacked the town. The 2/43rd Battalion was assigned the task of the main assault, while the 2/32nd Battalion was tasked with flank protection. Despite being hamstrung by torrential downpour and unforgiving terrain, the 2/32nd Battalion secured the south bank of the Padas River, while one company from the 2/43rd was sent to take the town and another marched to the flanks, to take up ambush positions along the route that the Japanese were expected to withdraw along. The 2/28th Battalion secured the lines of communication north of the river. The resistance from the Japanese defenders was not co-ordinated and as a result the Australians had secured their objectives by nightfall. Throughout the night, however, the Japanese launched six counterattacks which eventually broke down into hand-to-hand combat. During the course of these actions, one company became isolated and the next morning, 28 June, another was sent to its aid to attack the Japanese force from the rear. Fighting its way through numerous Japanese positions throughout the afternoon, the company reached their objective in the early evening and launched its assault, killing at least 100 Japanese defenders. It was <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> action that Private Tom Starcevich, of the 2/43rd Battalion, performed the deeds for which he was later awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
25|$|Sharif, {{during his}} first term, found it {{difficult}} working with the PPP and the Mutahidda Qaumi Movement (MQM), a potent force in Karachi. The MQM and PPP opposed Sharif widely due to his focus on beautifying Punjab and Kashmir while neglecting Sindh. The MQM, a liberal force, also opposed Sharif's conservatism. The clash between liberalism and conservatism soon erupted forces in 1992 when political tension began to arise in which both party renegading ideological war against each other. Despite MQM had formed government with Sharif, more and more problems were mounted between Sharif and the MQM in 1992. Sharif's government members passed the resolution in the Parliament, to launch the paramilitary operation to end the cold war between PML-N and MQM. During this time, the centre left Pakistan Peoples Party remained quiet and neutral while watching {{the impact of the}} cold war between liberal and conservative forces. Prime minister Sharif also contended this upcoming operation with Chief of Army Staff General Asif Navaz over the paramilitary operation in Sindh Province (See Operation Clean-Up). Launched in 1992, violence erupted in Karachi and brought an economic halt in the country that dismantled Sharif's industrialisation and investment that was being brought by Sharif. Benazir Bhutto, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> episode, remained silent as she too had opposed the MQM.
