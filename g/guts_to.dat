5|$|Termites are detritivores, {{consuming}} dead {{plants at}} any level of decomposition. They also {{play a vital role}} in the ecosystem by recycling waste material such as dead wood, faeces and plants. Many species eat cellulose, having a specialised midgut that breaks down the fibre. Termites are considered to be a major source (11%) of atmospheric methane, one of the prime greenhouse gases, produced from the breakdown of cellulose. Termites rely primarily upon symbiotic protozoa (metamonads) and other microbes such as flagellate protists in their <b>guts</b> <b>to</b> digest the cellulose for them, allowing them to absorb the end products for their own use. Gut protozoa, such as Trichonympha, in turn, rely on symbiotic bacteria embedded on their surfaces to produce some of the necessary digestive enzymes. Most higher termites, especially in the family Termitidae, can produce their own cellulase enzymes, but they rely primarily upon the bacteria. The flagellates have been lost in Termitidae. Scientists' understanding of the relationship between the termite digestive tract and the microbial endosymbionts is still rudimentary; what is true in all termite species, however, is that the workers feed the other members of the colony with substances derived from the digestion of plant material, either from the mouth or anus. Judging from closely related bacterial species, it is strongly presumed that the termites' and cockroach's gut microbiota derives from their dictyopteran ancestors.|$|E

25|$|During {{his presidential}} campaign, Ma participated {{in one of}} the debates that {{discussed}} many topics, including environmental protection. The Taiwan Academy of Ecology evaluated the policies of both candidates Hsieh and Ma, and the secretary of its workstation in Taipei said that both candidates failed their expectations, but they had more hope for Hsieh than Ma because Ma's environmental concepts lack considerations of reality. In February 2008, several environmental groups created a list of commitments for the two candidates to sign. DPP candidate Frank Hsieh agreed to all the items on the list and signed it in March. Ma did not and emailed the group instead. The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU) criticized Ma for ignoring important issues and not having the <b>guts</b> <b>to</b> sign the commitments.|$|E
25|$|The {{tarantula}} hawk’s namesake {{comes from}} its predation of tarantulas {{to raise their}} young. After mating, the female wasp will seek out a tarantula, either free ranging or in its burrow. After grappling with the tarantula, the wasp will deliver a powerful sting that essentially paralyzes the tarantula permanently, but keeps it alive. This allows the wasp to lay an egg that adheres to the spider’s abdomen. One tarantula is provisioned per egg. The egg is about 5 millimeters long, gently curved, and creamy white in color. The wasp will then drag the paralyzed tarantula along with the egg, sometimes up to 100 meters, to a cavity or burrow to be sealed. This dugout can be either dug by the wasp or be the burrow of the paralyzed spider. When the larva hatches, it will feed on the spider’s <b>guts</b> <b>to</b> completion, keeping the spider alive {{for as long as}} possible for freshness.|$|E
25|$|Living {{habits are}} varied; the family {{includes}} both bottom-foraging and midwater species. Callichthyids inhabit {{a wide range}} of habitats, from small, swift, oxygen-rich creeks to big rivers and flooded areas. Their habitats may even include swampy and muddy habitats where oxygen may be virtually absent. Callichthyids survive in these conditions by breathing air; air is collected at the water surface and swallowed. The intestines are used to absorb oxygen, and the air is expelled from the anus. The anterior digestive intestine packages digesta into a string of slightly compressed boluses, creating an air channel in the digestive intestine, thus allowing air to pass unimpeded. The posterior intestine is modified for respiration into a thin-walled and highly vascularized structure by reduction of the thickness of the epithelium, submucosa, and muscle layers; though highly modified to absorb air, it is inefficient for digestive purposes. Air moving through the digestive tract facilitates the movement of digesta to the rectum. Unlike other catfish such as loricariids or trichomycterids that may breathe air only under hypoxic conditions, callichthyids breathe air under all water conditions. Some callichthyids are able to absorb air through their hind <b>guts</b> <b>to</b> move short distances on land. Air stored in their digestive tracts also accounts for 75% of the necessary air for neutral buoyancy.|$|E

500|$|With {{the fall}} of Sihanouk, Hanoi became alarmed at the {{prospect}} of a pro-Western regime that might allow the Americans to establish a military presence on their western flank. To prevent that from happening, they began transferring their military installations away from the border regions to locations deeper within Cambodian territory. A new command center was established at the city of Kratié and the timing of the move was propitious. President Nixon was of the opinion that: [...] "We need a bold move in Cambodia to show that we stand with Lon Nol...something symbolic...for the only Cambodian regime that had the <b>guts</b> <b>to</b> take a pro-Western and pro-American stand." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{experience}} of the M3 in the North African Campaign was completely different. The gun was not powerful {{enough to deal with}} late production German Panzer III and IV tanks. After the nearly disastrous Battle of Kasserine Pass in February 1943, reports from some of the involved units mentioned 37mm projectiles [...] "bouncing off like marbles" [...] from the turret and front armor of German medium tanks and proclaimed the gun [...] "useless unless you have gun crews with the <b>guts</b> <b>to</b> stand and shoot from 100yards". The Army was initially uncertain if these reports reflected the obsolescence of the weapon, or whether unrefined tactics and lack of experience were to blame. Yet, on 26 May 1943, a new organization had the M3 replaced by the 57mm Gun M1 (the U.S.-produced version of the British 6-pounder gun), with Dodge 1½ ton trucks as prime movers. Only by spring 1944 did the 57mm gun reach the battlefield in large numbers.|$|E
