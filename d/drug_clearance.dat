50|$|Induction of CYP3A4 {{has been}} shown to vary in humans {{depending}} on sex. Evidence shows an increased <b>drug</b> <b>clearance</b> by CYP3A4 in women, even when accounting for differences in body weight. A study by Wobold et al.

CYP3A4 mRNA transcripts were found in similar proportions, suggesting a pre-translational mechanism for the up-regulation of CYP3A4 in women. The exact cause of this elevated level of enzyme in women is still under speculation, however studies have elucidated other mechanisms (such as CYP3A5 or CYP3A7 compensation for lowered levels of CYP3A4) that affect <b>drug</b> <b>clearance</b> in both men and women.|$|E

40|$|In vitro and in vivo {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the induction or inhibition of cytochrome P 450 (CYP) {{is one of the major}} mechanisms for some clinically important pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions. An attempt was made to simulate the effects of herbal preparation with single or multiple CYP-inhibiting constituents on the area of the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of coadministered drug that was either a low <b>clearance</b> <b>drug</b> by intravenous (i. v.) injection or a high <b>clearance</b> <b>drug</b> by oral route. Our simulation studies indicated that the expected increase (Rc) in the AUC of the coadministered drug by inhibiting herbal constituent(s) was dependent on the route of administration. For low <b>clearance</b> <b>drug</b> by i. v. injection, Rc was generally determined by inhibition constant (Ki), unbound inhibitor concentration ([I]), hepatic fraction (fh), number of inhibitory herbal constituents (n) and metabolic pathway fraction in hepatic metabolism (fm), while Rc for a high <b>clearance</b> <b>drug</b> by oral route, Rc was determined by Ki, [I], n and fm. By varying these parameters, Rc changed accordingly. It appeared likely to predict a herb-drug metabolic interaction, if the inhibiting herbal constituents could be quantitatively determined. However, many herb- and drug-related factors may cause difficulties with the prediction, and thus in vivo animal and human studies are always necessary.

5000|$|In general medicine, enteral {{nutrition}} or drug administration (Greek enteros, [...] "intestine") is feeding or drug administration by the digestion process of a gastrointestinal (GI) tract, {{such as the}} human gastrointestinal tract. This contrasts with par{{enteral nutrition}} or drug administration (Greek para, [...] "besides" [...] + enteros), which occurs from routes outside the GI tract, such as intravenous routes. Generally, drugs are given by two general methods: enteral and parenteral administration. Enteral administration involves the esophagus, stomach, and small and large intestines (i.e., the gastrointestinal tract). Methods of administration include oral, sublingual (dissolving the drug under the tongue), and rectal. Parenteral routes do not involve the gastrointestinal tract.

50|$|Drug {{delivery}} systems, lipid- or polymer-based nanoparticles, can {{be designed}} to improve the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the drug. However, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nanomedicine is highly variable among different patients. When designed to avoid the body's defence mechanisms, nanoparticles have beneficial properties {{that can be used}} to improve drug delivery. Complex drug delivery mechanisms are being developed, including the ability to get drugs through cell membranes and into cell cytoplasm. Triggered response is one way for drug molecules to be used more efficiently. Drugs are placed in the body and only activate on encountering a particular signal. For example, a drug with poor solubility will be replaced by a drug delivery system where both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments exist, improving the solubility. Drug delivery systems may also be able to prevent tissue damage through regulated drug release; reduce <b>drug</b> <b>clearance</b> rates; or lower the volume of distribution and reduce the effect on non-target tissue. However, the biodistribution of these nanoparticles is still imperfect due to the complex host's reactions to nano- and microsized materials and the difficulty in targeting specific organs in the body. Nevertheless, a lot of work is still ongoing to optimize and better understand the potential and limitations of nanoparticulate systems. While advancement of research proves that targeting and distribution can be augmented by nanoparticles, the dangers of nanotoxicity become an important next step in further understanding of their medical uses.|$|E

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of aztreonam {{in eight}} adult patients with severe burn injuries (total {{body surface area}} burn, 49 % + 21 % [mean + standard deviation]) were studied. The time of initiation of study following burn injury was 7. 0 ± 1. 4 days. Four patients at first dose and at steady state were studied. Aztreonam concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, and a two-compartment model was used to fit the data. No significant differences in any pharmacokinetic parameters between first dose and steady state were observed. Volume of distribution of the central compartment after first dose (0. 14 liters/kg) and volume of distribution at steady state (0. 31 liters/kg) were approximately 30 % higher than those reported for other patient populations. Total <b>drug</b> <b>clearance</b> and renal <b>drug</b> <b>clearance</b> when normalized to creatinine clearance (CLCR) {{were similar to those}} previously reported for other critically ill patients.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} : Increasing {{interest}} is being directed toward possible {{benefits associated with}} continuous infusion of time-dependent antibiotics such as beta-lactams and vancomycin to critically ill patients. The background, emerging evidence and practical considerations associated with continuous infusions are discussed. Recent findings : One large retrospective cohort study has found clinical outcome benefits of administering a P-lactam antibiotic by extended infusion compared with bolus administration. This complements a smaller randomized controlled trial comparing continuous infusion and intermittent bolus administration. For vancomycin, clinical outcome benefits have only been shown in a ventilator-associated pneumonia cohort of critically ill patients. No clinical outcome {{studies have been conducted}} for other timedependent antibiotics. Summary : Continuous infusion of vancomycin and P-lactam antibiotics enables faster and more consistent attainment of therapeutic levels compared with intermittent bolus dosing. Although the clinical benefits have not been conclusively shown at this time, compelling pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic support for continuous infusion nevertheless exists. Given that critically ill patients may develop very large volumes of distribution as well as supranormal <b>drug</b> <b>clearances,</b> individualized therapy through the use of therapeutic drug monitoring is required.

40|$|Pharmacokinetic {{principles}} during continuous renal replacement therapy: Drugs and dosage. Some {{drugs are}} removed significantly by continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRTs), and a substitutional dose {{is required to}} prevent underdosing of the substance. This review outlines the basic pharmacokinetic principles that determine whether a dose adjustment is required. Only the free non-protein-bound fraction of a drug can pass through the dialyzer membrane. In postdilution hemofiltration the <b>drug</b> <b>clearance</b> equals the ultrafiltration rate, while in predilution hemofiltration, the dilution of the blood prior to filtration needs to be considered when calculating clearance. In continuous hemodialysis, drugs are eliminated by diffusion. Drugs with a higher molecular weight will diffuse more slowly and show a lower clearance than smaller drugs. The clinical relevance of a given <b>drug</b> <b>clearance</b> caused by CRRT will mainly depend on the competing <b>drug</b> <b>clearance</b> by other elimination pathways. Even a high clearance for a drug may be irrelevant for overall drug removal if nonrenal clearance pathways provide a much higher clearance rate. The ideal drug to be removed by CRRT that requires a dose adjustment has: a low protein binding, a low volume of distribution, and a low nonrenal clearance. Examples include aminoglycosides, vancomycin, fosfomycin, and flucytosine. Even {{if there are no}} studies available on the pharmacokinetics of a particular drug during CRRT, knowledge of the basic concepts of drug elimination by continuous hemodialysis allows a prediction of whether or not a dose adjustment will be required during CRRT...|$|E

Patients received either saquinavir, zalcitabine, {{or a combination}} of both, together with zidovudine three times a day. Approximately 100 patients were enrolled in each treatment arm, and intensive pharmacokinetic studies were performed on about 25 patients per arm at weeks 1 and 12. We estimated the pharmacokinetic parameters of all three drugs by using parametric and nonparametric methods. The mean values of the pharmacokinetic parameters of zidovudine (clearance [CL]/bioavailability [F], 168 liters/h; volume of distribution [V]/F, 185 liters; half-life, 0. 76 h) and zalcitabine (CL/F, 25 liters/h; V/F, 92. 2 liters; half-life, 2. 7 h) were similar to those reported previously. For saquinavir, the mean pharmacokinetic parameter estimates using parametric methods were as follows: maximum concentration of drug in serum [Cmax], 70. 8 ng/ml; time to Cmax, 3. 11 h; area under the curve, 809 ng x h/ml; CL/F, 989 liters/h; V/F, 1, 503 liters; half-life, 1. 38 h.

40|$|Hepatic drug {{metabolism}} by cytochrome P 450 enzymes is altered by the nutritional status of patients. The expression of P 450 enzymes is partly {{regulated by the}} constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Fasting regulates the expression of both P 450 enzymes and CAR and affects hepatic <b>drug</b> <b>clearance.</b> We hypothesized that the fasting-induced alterations in P 450 mediated <b>drug</b> <b>clearance</b> are mediated by CAR. To investigate this we used a drug cocktail validated in humans consisting of five widely prescribed drugs as probes for specific P 450 enzymes: caffeine (CYP 1 A 2), metoprolol (CYP 2 D 6), omeprazole (CYP 2 C 19), midazolam (CYP 3 A 4) and s-warfarin (CYP 2 C 9). This cocktail was administered to wild type (WT, C 57 Bl/ 6) mice or mice deficient for CAR (CAR-/-) that were either fed ad libitum or fasted for 24 hours. Blood was sampled at predefined intervals and drug concentrations were measured as well as hepatic mRNA expression of homologous/orthologous P 450 enzymes (Cyp 1 a 2, Cyp 2 d 22, Cyp 3 a 11, Cyp 2 c 37, Cyp 2 c 38 and Cyp 2 c 65). Fasting decreased Cyp 1 a 2 and Cyp 2 d 22 expression and increased Cyp 3 a 11 and Cyp 2 c 38 expression in both WT and CAR-/- mice. The decrease in Cyp 1 a 2 was diminished in CAR-/- in comparison with WT mice. Basal Cyp 2 c 37 expression was lower in CAR-/- compared to WT mice. Fasting decreased the clearance of all drugs tested in both WT and CAR-/- mice. The absence of CAR was associated with an decrease in the clearance of omeprazole, metoprolol and midazolam in fed mice. The fasting-induced reduction in clearance of s-warfarin was greater in WT than in CAR-/-. The changes in <b>drug</b> <b>clearance</b> correlated with the expression pattern of the specific P 450 enzymes in case of Cyp 1 a 2 -caffeine and Cyp 2 c 37 -omeprazole.

Optimizing the individual dosage of riluzole {{may have the}} potential to improve the effect of riluzole treatment on survival of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Limited data are available on the in vivo metabolic elimination of riluzole. From in vitro experiments, CYP 1 A 2 seems to be mainly involved in riluzole clearance. However, in vitro studies suggest that formation of riluzole-glucuronide plays a role and may determine the drug's pharmacokinetic variability in patients to some extent. In the current study the formation of riluzole-glucuronide was examined in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. It also aimed at relating glucuronidation of riluzole to differential UGT 1 A 1 * 28 genotypes. The formation of riluzole-glucuronide was confirmed in serum from a group of 14 ALS patients taking riluzole. Riluzole-glucuronide concentrations were positively associated with those of riluzole. In a separate group of 131 ALS patients taking riluzole, the UGT 1 A 1 * 28 genotype was not associated with trough or peak serum concentrations of riluzole. This study provides evidence that the in vivo metabolic elimination of riluzole in ALS patients involves glucuronidation.
