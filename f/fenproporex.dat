40|$|<b>Fenproporex</b> is {{the second}} most {{commonly}} amphetamine-based anorectic consumed worldwide; this drug is rapidly converted into amphetamine, in vivo, and acts by increasing dopamine levels in the synaptic cleft. Considering that <b>fenproporex</b> effects on the central nervous system are still poorly known and that acetylcholinesterase is a regulatory enzyme which is involved in cholinergic synapses and may indirectly modulate the release of dopamine, the present study investigated the effects of acute administration of <b>fenproporex</b> on acetylcholinesterase activity in brain of young rats. Young male Wistar rats received a single injection of <b>fenproporex</b> (6. 25, 12. 5 or 25 mg/kg i. p.) or vehicle (2 % Tween 80). Two hours after the injection, the rats were killed by decapitation and the brain was removed for evaluation of acetylcholinesterase activity. Results showed that <b>fenproporex</b> administration increased acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus and posterior cortex, whereas in the prefrontal cortex, striatum and cerebellum the enzyme activity was not altered. In conclusion, in the present study we demonstrated that acute administration of <b>fenproporex</b> exerts an effect in the cholinergic system causing an increase in the activity of acetylcholinesterase in a dose-dependent manner in the hippocampus and posterior cortex. Thus, we suggest that the imbalance in cholinergic homeostasis could be considered as an important pathophysiological mechanism underlying the brain damage observed in patients who use amphetamines such as <b>fenproporex...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objectives: <b>Fenproporex</b> is an amphetamine-based {{anorectic}} {{which is}} rapidly converted into amphetamine in vivo. Na+, K+-ATPase is a membrane-bound enzyme {{necessary to maintain}} neuronal excitability. Considering {{that the effects of}} <b>fenproporex</b> on brain metabolism are poorly known and that Na+, K+-ATPase is essential for normal brain function, this study sought to evaluate the effect of this drug on Na+, K+-ATPase activity in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, and striatum of young rats. Methods: Young male Wistar rats received a single injection of <b>fenproporex</b> (6. 25, 12. 5, or 25 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or polysorbate 80 (control group). Two hours after the last injection, the rats were killed by decapitation and the brain was removed for evaluation of Na+, K+-ATPase activity. Results: <b>Fenproporex</b> decreased Na+, K+-ATPase activity in the striatum of young rats at doses of 6. 25, 12. 5, and 25 mg/kg and increased enzyme activity in the hypothalamus at the same doses. Na+, K+-ATPase activity was not affected in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex. Conclusion: <b>Fenproporex</b> administration decreased Na+, K+-ATPase activity in the striatum even in low doses. However, in the hypothalamus, Na+, K+-ATPase activity was increased. Changes in this enzyme might be the result of the effects of <b>fenproporex</b> on neuronal excitability...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} {{clinical evidence}} on the safety and efficacy of <b>fenproporex</b> for treating obesity. METHODS MEDLINE, LILACS and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched as well as references cited by articles and relevant documents. Two authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and regarding risk of bias, collected data, and accuracy. Eligible studies were all those placebo-controlled that provided data on the efficacy and safety of <b>Fenproporex</b> to treat obesity. RESULTS Only four controlled studies met the inclusion criteria. One randomized, placebo-controlled trial on <b>Fenproporex</b> was found on electronic databases. Three placebo-controlled studies (in non-indexed journals) were identified by hand-searching. Patients with cardiovascular and other comorbidities were excluded in all studies. Trials lasted from 40 to 364 days and doses ranged from 20 to 33. 6 mg/d. All controlled studies found that weight loss among Fenproporex-treated patients was greater than that produced by the placebo, but drug effect was modest. <b>Fenproporex</b> produced additional weight reductions of 4. 7 kg (one year), 3. 8 kg (six months) and 1. 55 kg (two months) in average, in relation to diet and exercise only (three trials). Insomnia, irritability, and anxiety were the most frequently reported side effects in the four studies. CONCLUSIONS There is a paucity of randomized, placebo-controlled trials on <b>Fenproporex</b> and those identified here present major methodological flaws. These studies suggest that <b>Fenproporex</b> is modestly effective in promoting weight loss. Nonetheless, they failed to provide evidence that it reduces obesity-associated morbidity and mortality. Data from these studies are insufficient to determine the risk-benefit profile of <b>Fenproporex.</b> Abuse potential and amphetamine-like adverse effects are causes for concern...|$|E

40|$|The {{abuse of}} psychoactive drugs is {{considered}} a global health problem. During the last years, a relevant {{number of studies have}} investigated the relationship between anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) and other psychoactive drugs. AAS, such as testosterone, can cause a dependence syndrome that shares many features with the classical dependence to psychoactive substances. Pre-clinical evidence shows that there are interactions between testosterone and psychoactive drugs, such as cocaine. However, few studies have been performed to investigate the effect of repeated testosterone treatment on behavioral effects of amphetamine derivatives, such as <b>fenproporex.</b> The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the effects of repeated testosterone administration on fenproporex-induced locomotor activity in adolescent and adult rats. Adolescent male Wistar rats were injected with testosterone (10 mg/kg sc for 10 days). After 3 days, animals received an acute injection of <b>fenproporex</b> (3. 0 mg/kg ip) and the locomotor activity was recorded during 40 min. Thirty days later, the same animals received the same treatment with testosterone followed by a <b>fenproporex</b> challenge injection as described above. Our results demonstrated that repeated testosterone induced behavioral sensitization to <b>fenproporex</b> in adolescent but not in adult rats.

30|$|Nearly 100  years ago, Kraepelin {{made the}} {{observation}} that with {{an increasing number of}} episodes the course of the illness worsens, the so-called sensitization model of BD (Kraepelin 1909; Post 1992). Later on behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants in rodents was used to resemble the shortening of interepisodic intervals during the progression of BD in humans (Post 1990). Repeated administration of the same dose of cocaine induced hyperactivity and elevated stereotypy responses in rats (Kilbey and Ellinwood 1977; Post 1990). A drug-high state after the administration of psychostimulants was furthermore associated with increased aggression (Borison et al. 1978; Davies et al. 1974), a declined cognitive performance (Fries et al. 2015; Rygula et al. 2015) and deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI) (Zheng et al. 2013). Several different psychostimulants were administrated to induce mania-like behavior. Apart from cocaine, the used substances were amphetamine (Frey et al. 2006), lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (Macêdo et al. 2013), and <b>fenproporex</b> in rats (Rezin et al. 2014), and alpha-lipoid acid (Macêdo et al. 2012) and GBR 12909 in mice (Queiroz et al. 2015).

40|$|Background: Obesity is {{a serious}} chronic disease and the {{prevalence}} of this condition is increasing among the elderly. Although the benefits of weight loss to improve control of associated diseases are well known in young adults, {{they are not in}} older patients. The use of anti-obesity drugs to promote weight loss is widespread in Brazil and other countries, and obesity specialists frequently prescribe medicines in doses and for durations previously unreported in the literature. Sibutramine, orlistat and amfepramone (diethylpropion) have been evaluated in clinical trials of more than 2 years` duration in adults, demonstrating safety and efficacy, but long-term studies in obesity treatment are absent for other drugs. The efficacy and safety of obesity pharmacotherapy among the elderly is unknown. Objective: To describe the experience of obesity pharmacotherapy in the elderly in a specialized obesity care setting in Brazil, with a focus on efficacy and safety. Methods: A retrospective evaluation was conducted on medical charts from an outpatient clinic of a specialized tertiary centre for the treatment of obesity. We included patients who had had at least one consultation between January and December 2007, were aged >= 60 years {{at the beginning of the}} treatment, had had at least 6 months of follow-up and had received a prescription of at least one potential weight-loss drug. Diagnoses reported on medical records were documented. Age, weight, height and body mass index (BMI) were recorded at admission, after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, and at the last available visit. The medicines prescribed, together with the dose, duration of use, adverse effects and reasons for discontinuation, were documented. Results: The group consisted of 44 women (86 %) and 7 men (14 %), with a mean +/- SD age of 65. 2 +/- 4. 5 years, weight of 95. 3 +/- 12. 5 kg and BMI of 38. 5 +/- 4. 3 kg/m(2). The mean +/- SD time of follow-up was 39. 3 +/- 26. 4 months, and the mean weight loss was 6. 65 kg (p = 5 % was achieved by 64. 71 %, 63. 64 %, 62. 16 % and 69. 70 % in the 6 th, 12 th, 18 th and 24 th months, respectively, and a weight loss of >= 10 % was achieved by 17. 65 %, 34. 09 %, 32. 43 % and 39. 39 % in the 6 th, 12 th, 18 th and 24 th months, respectively. The medicines prescribed were sibutramine, orlistat, fluoxetine, sertraline, topiramate, <b>fenproporex,</b> mazindol and amfepramone, alone or in combinations, concomitantly or sequentially. The reasons for discontinuation were lack of response (n = 13), loss of response (development of tolerance) [n= 11], lack of adherence (n = 14) and adverse effects (n= 14).

40|$|A fast {{method was}} {{optimized}} and validated {{in order to}} quantify amphetamine-type stimulants (amphetamine, AMP; methamphetamine, MAMP; <b>fenproporex,</b> FPX; 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA; and 3, 4 -methylenedioxyamphetamine, MDA) in human hair samples. The method was based in an initial procedure of decontamination of hair samples (50 mg) with dichloromethane, followed by alkaline hydrolysis and extraction of the amphetamines using hollow-fiber liquid-phase micro extraction (HF-LPME) in the three-phase mode. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used for identification and quantification of the analytes. The LoQs obtained for all amphetamines (around 0. 05 ng/mg) were below the cut-off value (0. 2 ng/mg) established by the Society of Hair Testing (SoHT). The method showed to be simple and precise. The intra-day and inter-day precisions were within 10. 6 % and 11. 4 %, respectively, {{with the use of}} only two deuteratecl internal standards (AMP-d 5 and MDMA-d 5). By using the weighted least squares linear regression (1 /x(2)), the accuracy of the method was satisfied in the lower concentration levels (accuracy values better than 87 %). Hair samples collected from six volunteers who reported regular use of amphetamines were submitted to the developed method. Drug detection was observed in all samples of the volunteers.

The studies showed the adsorptive behavior of amfepramone at the HMDE and were performed in H 2 SO 4 0. 1 mol L- 1 (pH 1. 0) and Ringer buffer (pH 11. 0) as supporting electrolytes. The linear range for the amfepramone determination by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was 0. 05 to 2. 0 mg L- 1 (r = 0. 998) in acidic medium and 0. 25 to 4. 0 mg L- 1 (r = 0. 994) in alkaline medium. The relative standard deviation calculated was 2. 5 % and 4. 0 % for five measurements of 0. 5 mg L- 1 amfepramone in acidic and alkaline medium, respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The International Narcotics Control Board {{released}} its 2005 annual report, highlighting the Brazil population {{as one of}} the largest consumers of anorectics. In Brazil, the National Health Surveillance Agency issued the resolution RDC 58 / 2007 in order to control the prescription and sale of such drugs. In Belém, the biggest city in the Brazilian Amazon region, this resolution came into force in 2008, leading to inspections of drugstores and magistral pharmacies. The aim of this work was to evaluate the consumption of psychotropic anorectic drugs and the impact of RDC 58 / 2007 on the prescription and dispensing of anorectics in drugstores and magistral pharmacies in Belém. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective quantitative and descriptive study was conducted of records from the Municipal Department of Health Surveillance of Belém, for 2005 to 2008. The differences in findings were regarded significant when p < 0. 05. RESULTS: A total of 1, 641 balance sheets of drugstores and magistral pharmacies were analyzed. Amfepramone was the most dispensed medication, followed by <b>fenproporex</b> and mazindol. The highest consumption of anorectics occurred in magistral pharmacies. In 2008, there was a significant reduction in dispensing of anorectics, in drugstores as well as in magistral pharmacies. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that there was a decrease in the dispensing of anorectics after RDC 58 / 2007 came into force, and that the magistral pharmacies dispensed more of these drugs. This resolution is a remarkable tool in health control, where it is of great benefit to public health and contributes substantially to the rational use of medicines in Brazil...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} efficacy and safety of amfepramone, <b>fenproporex</b> and mazindol as a monotherapy for the treatment of obese or overweight patients. A systematic review of primary studies was conducted, followed by a direct meta-analysis (random effect) and mixed treatment comparison. Medline and other databases were searched. Heterogeneity was explored through I 2 associated with a p-value. Of 739 identified publications, 25 were included in the meta-analysis. The global evaluation of Cochrane resulted in 19 studies with a high level of bias and six with unclear risk. Due to the lack of information in primary studies, direct meta-analyses were conducted only for amfepramone and mazindol. Compared to placebo, amfepramone resulted in higher weight loss in the short-term (< 180 days; mean difference (MD) - 1. 281 kg; p< 0. 05; I 2 : 0. 0 %; p= 0. 379) and long-term (≥ 180 days; MD - 6. 518 kg; p< 0. 05; I 2 : 0. 0 %; p= 0. 719). Only studies with long-term follow up reported efficacy in terms of abdominal circumference and 5 - 10 % weight reduction. These results corroborated the finding that the efficacy of amfepramone is greater than that of placebo. Treatment with mazindol showed greater short-term weight loss than that with placebo (MD - 1. 721 kg; p< 0. 05; I 2 : 0. 9 %; p= 0. 388). However, metabolic outcomes were poorly described, preventing a meta-analysis. A mixed treatment comparison corroborated the direct meta-analysis. Considering the high level of risk of bias and the absence of important published outcomes for anti-obesity therapy assessments, this study found that the evaluated drugs showed poor evidence of efficacy in the treatment of overweight and obese patients.
