40|$|The {{effect of}} copper (Cu) barrier film {{deposition}} process on the Cu interconnects was investigated, including the waiting time between Cu chemical mechanical polishing and the barrier <b>dielectric</b> <b>deposition,</b> the preheating time, ammonia (NH(3)) plasma treatment {{prior to the}} barrier <b>dielectric</b> <b>deposition,</b> and various types of barrier dielectric. Effective treatment on the Cu surface ensures superior conductivity of the Cu interconnects and enhances the adhesion between Cu and the barrier film, causing a longer electromigration failure time. However, excessive thermal time (preheating, treatment, and deposition time) induces the Cu hillock defect. Furthermore, silicon nitride (SiN) film with a lower hydrogen content has better physical and reliability performances. Therefore, optimization of the Cu barrier deposition process is important to improve the performance of Cu interconnects. (C) 2010 American Vacuum Society. [DOI: 10. 1116 / 1. 3425631...|$|E

40|$|Novel devices {{consisting}} of uniform-waist tapered optical fibers with asymmetric double-layer (metal plus <b>dielectric)</b> <b>depositions</b> have been recently proposed as refractive-index sensors. We study {{the properties of}} light transmission by use {{of this kind of}} devices, and we specifically perform a detailed study of the generation of surface-plasma waves in the structures.

The behavior also depends on the wavelength and the state of polarization of the incident light. The use of uniform-waist tapers allows for control of constructive parameters and an increase in the interaction length with the outer medium. We show how the plasmons are excited in the region of the taper waist by a coupling with the cladding modes guided in that area.

40|$|InP/InGaAsP weakly {{confined}} wave guides, are {{of interest}} for the fabrication {{of a variety of}} optoelectronic devices, including optical cross point switches. Previous studies have shown that stress from metallization alters the behavior of these waveguides and the strain-induced changes in refractive index have been investigated by studying the degree of polarization (DOP) from the facets of ridge waveguide (RWG) lasers. However, in devices intended for waveguide routing or switching, (where the degree of confinement is much weaker than that found in ridge waveguide lasers), e-beam deposited TiPtAu contacts, caused broadening and splitting of the optical near field mode profile after thermal annealing and increased waveguide loss. In this paper, we report the results of a study of process-induced changes on the optical near field mode profile, for different <b>dielectric</b> <b>depositions,</b> metalizations and anneal cycles. It was found that the addition of a layer of sputtered W to the e-beam metal stack provided sufficient compressive stress to balance the (otherwise) tensile stress from the TiPtAu. This not only eliminated the mode splitting, but for sufficiently high values of compressive stress, was found to actually sharpen the mode and enhance the guiding. On the basis of these results stable waveguides, suitable for routing or switching were achieved for a range of device parameters, operating conditions and process parameter variations.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} {{a solution to}} achieve robust enhancement-mode Al 2 O 3 /GaN MISFETs with a high breakdown voltage and suggest a possible model for the device off-state breakdown. It is found that the device breakdown exhibits different gate voltage dependence for different surface treatments before the gate <b>dielectric</b> <b>deposition.</b> The device performance is greatly improved by using an in-situ surface plasma treatment. The improved device performance is explained by a reduction of traps at the Al 2 O 3 /GaN interface, which finally leads {{to a reduction in}} the amount of trapped positive charges and associated with that a reduction of the effective electric field across the gate dielectric when the device is in off-state. Several experimental results support this hypothesis: (1) The recoverable negative threshold voltage shift after reverse gate bias depends on the interface clean before gate <b>dielectric</b> <b>deposition,</b> (2) The reverse bias gate dielectric breakdown voltage is improved by this interface plasma treatment, although the forward bias gate dielectric breakdown voltage is identical...|$|E
