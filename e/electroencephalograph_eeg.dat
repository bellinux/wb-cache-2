5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hepatic encephalopathy {{can only be}} made in the presence of confirmed liver disease (types A and C) or a portosystemic shunt (type B), as its symptoms are similar to those encountered in other encephalopathies. To make the distinction, abnormal liver function tests and/or ultrasound suggesting liver disease are required, and ideally liver biopsy. The symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy may also arise from other conditions, such as cerebral haemorrhage and seizures (both of which are more common in chronic liver disease). A CT scan of the brain may be required to exclude haemorrhage, and if seizure activity is suspected an <b>electroencephalograph</b> (<b>EEG)</b> study may be performed. Rarer mimics of encephalopathy are meningitis, encephalitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy and Wilson's disease; these may be suspected on clinical grounds and confirmed with investigations.|$|E
500|$|Brain-computer {{interfaces}} (BCIs) are {{a developing}} technology that clinicians hope {{will one day}} bring more independence and agency to the severely physically disabled. Those the technology {{has the potential to}} help include people with near-total or total paralysis, such as those with tetraplegia (quadriplegia) or advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); BCIs are intended to help them to communicate or even move objects such as motorized wheelchairs, neuroprostheses, or robotic grasping tools. Few of these technologies are currently in regular use by people with disabilities, but a diverse array are in development at an experimental level. One type of BCI uses event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the mu wave in order to control the computer. This method of monitoring brain activity takes advantage of the fact that when a group of neurons is at rest they tend to fire in synchrony with each other. When a participant is cued to imagine movement (an [...] "event"), the resulting desynchronization (the group of neurons that was firing in synchronous waves now firing in complex and individualized patterns) can be reliably detected and analyzed by a computer. Users of such an interface are trained in visualizing movements, typically of the foot, hand, and/or tongue, which are each in different locations on the cortical homunculus and thus distinguishable by an <b>electroencephalograph</b> (<b>EEG)</b> or electrocorticograph (ECoG) recording of electrical activity over the motor cortex. In this method, computers monitor for a typical pattern of mu wave ERD contralateral to the visualized movement combined with event-related synchronization (ERS) in the surrounding tissue. This paired pattern intensifies with training, and the training increasingly takes the form of games, some of which utilize virtual reality. Some researchers have found that the feedback from virtual reality games is particularly effective in giving the user tools to improve control of his or her mu wave patterns. The ERD method can be combined with one or more other methods of monitoring the brain's electrical activity to create hybrid BCIs, which often offer more flexibility than a BCI that uses any single monitoring method.|$|E
2500|$|Biofeedback {{is often}} used to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of relaxation training, because it feeds back information to the chronic headache sufferer about the [...] "body's (biological) current state". One of the most common biofeedback tests is the Electromyograph (EMG), which evaluates the “electrical activity” produced by muscles. Biofeedback also can measure electrical brain activity through a test called the <b>Electroencephalograph</b> (<b>EEG).</b> Another test, called the thermograph, measures skin temperature, because when a person is relaxed they have increased blood flow and a higher temperature. Another method is BVP biofeedback training, which improves chronic headaches by teaching a patient how to regulate and decrease arterial pulse amplitudes by restricting the arteries. When tense, a person's sweat gland activity increases, which is measured by electrodermograph testing of the hands. Biofeedback methods have been proven to work. A study involving fifteen treatment sessions found that biofeedback was [...] "successful in reducing both frequency and severity of headache at discharge and over time". Biofeedback allows headache sufferers to identify problems and then seek to reduce them.|$|E

40|$|Certain {{regions of}} the human brain are {{activated}} both during action execution and action observation. This so-called ‘mirror neuron system’ has been proposed to enable an observer to understand an action through a process of internal motor simulation. Although there has been much speculation about the existence of such a system from early in life, to date there is little direct evidence that young infants recruit brain areas involved in action production during action observation. To address this question, we identified the individual frequency range in which sensorimotor alpha-band activity was attenuated in nine-month-old infants' <b>electroencephalographs</b> (<b>EEGs)</b> during elicited reaching for objects, and measured whether activity in this frequency range was also modulated by observing others' actions. We found that observing a grasping action resulted in motor activation in the infant brain, but that this activity began prior to observation of the action, once it could be anticipated. These results demonstrate not only that infants, like adults, display overlapping neural activity during execution and observation of actions, but that this activation, rather than being directly induced by the visual input, is driven by infants' understanding of a forthcoming action. These results provide support for theories implicating the motor system in action prediction...|$|R

40|$|Repeated focal {{electrical}} stimulation of the brain results in kindling, the development of generalized seizures that progress in length and severity as more seizures are elicited. Barnes et al. (2001) paired one context (CS+) with kindling stimulation of the amygdala, and another context (CS-) with sham stimulation. They found conditioned anticipatory fear responses in the CS+, a conditioned place aversion to the CS+, and more intense convulsions in the CS+ than in the CS- in a probe trial.

Methods: In this survey, all neurologists participating {{at the annual meeting of}} neurologists were asked to participate. These neurologists practice in Fars province. An anonymous questionnaire was specifically developed for this study. Results: About 18 neurologists (14 males and four females), out of 20 attendees, agreed to participate in the study. The mean age of the participants was 41. 6 ± 7. 5 years. They estimated that 10. 8 % of patients attending their clinic had seizures or blackouts, whereas 4. 4 % of patients attending their clinic had PNES.

40|$|Aims: To {{distinguish}} {{the most sensitive}} markers of methylphenidate (MPH) effects on behavior and underlying biology using an integrated cognitive and brain function test battery. Methods: A randomized placebo-controlled trial with 32 healthy adult males. Subjects were tested on MPH doses across 18 sessions with subjective mood, objective behavioral and biological endpoints. From a computerized battery of tests, behavioral measures were cognitive performance scores, while biological measures of brain function included <b>electroencephalographs</b> (<b>EEG)</b> and event-related potentials (ERPs) with complementary measures of autonomic arousal. Using mixed modeling analyses; we determined which measures were most affected by MPH dose and correlation analyses determined the associations among them. Results: MPH dose had the most pronounced effect on cognitive performance (sustained attention/vigilance), baseline autonomic arousal (heart rate, blood pressure) and baseline brain activity (EEG theta power). The faster reaction time, reduced errors, increased autonomic arousal and reductions in theta showed strong to moderate inter-correlations. MPH least affected subjective mood measures and early sensory ERP components. Discussion: These findings suggest that MPH increases cortical and autonomic arousal, facilitating vigilance. The combination of behavioral and biological measures may provide an objective set of markers of MPH response.

A total of 100 ictal <b>electroencephalographs</b> (<b>EEG)</b> during spontaneous recurrent seizures from 11 epileptic rats were finally included for the analysis. PCA was applied to the covariance matrix of a conventional EEG frequency band signal.

In order to compare the accuracy, we obtained the specific threshold satisfying the target performance from the training set, and compared the False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN), and Latency (Lat) of the PCA based feature derived from the initial segment of seizures to the other six features in the testing set. The PCA based feature derived from the initial segment of seizures performed significantly better than other features with a 1. 40 % FP, zero FN, and 0. 14 s Lat. These results demonstrated that the proposed frequency-based feature from PCA that captures the characteristics of the initial phase of seizure was effective for early detection of seizures.

(Clinical Psychology) Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) {{is a form of}} psychopathology characterised by difficulties with hyperactivity, attention and behavioural inhibition. Although ADHD has been historically considered a disorder specific to children, the contemporary consensus among researchers is that, in some cases, ADHD may persist into adulthood. Neurologically, ADHD is associated with deficits in the executive functions, located in the frontal lobe. Cortical arousal, which refers to the level of neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex and is measurable using <b>electroencephalograph</b> machinery (<b>EEGs),</b> is usually lower in the frontal lobes in those with ADHD when compared to individuals without the disorder. With regards to anxiety disorders, which are dysfunctional variations in the normal fear response, the aetiology of the pathologies in this category are multifaceted and complex. At the neurological level, however, there is a clear link between anxiety disorders and hypervigilance, which is characterised by high cortical arousal in the frontal lobes. Despite the fact that, at face value, it seems impossible for an increase and decrease in cortical arousal to occur simultaneously, ADHD is often diagnosed alongside anxiety disorders, and it is this anomaly which is the focus of this study. <b>Electroencephalograph</b> machinery (<b>EEGs)</b> are able to measure levels of cortical arousal using electrodes placed on the scalp.

40|$|Abstract—The {{development}} of an <b>electroencephalograph</b> (<b>EEG)</b> -based brain-computer interface (BCI) requires rapid and reliable discrimination of EEG patterns, e. g., associated with imaginary movement. One-sided hand movement imagination results in EEG changes located at contra- and ipsilateral central areas. We demonstrate that spatial filters for multichannel EEG effectively extract discriminatory information from two populations of single-trial EEG, recorded during left- and right-hand movement imagery. The best classification results for three subjects are 90. 8 %, 92. 7 %, and 99. 7 %. The spatial filters are estimated from a set of data by the method of common spatial patterns and reflect the specific activation of cortical areas. The method performs a weighting of the electrodes according to their importance for the classification task. The high recognition rates and computational simplicity make it a promising method for an EEG-based brain–computer interface.
