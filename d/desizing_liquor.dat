40|$|Woven fabrics of cotton, on {{the warp}} threads are coated with an {{adhesive}} sizing agent {{to prevent the}} threads from breaking during weaving process. Starch and its derivatives {{are the most common}} sizing agents. After weaving, starch must be removed in order to prepare the fabric for dyeing and finishing. This process is called as desizing and it include the use of chemicals such as acids, alkalis and oxidising agents with traditional process. Because of that in the world are carried out investigations to replace conventional chemical textile processes by eco-friendly and economically attractive bioprocesses using enzymes. This paper will show the experimental results relating to the selection of the enzyme and process optimization made in order to increase the content of glucose in the <b>desizing</b> <b>liquor</b> of starch sized cotton fabric. The results showed that the commercial desizing enzyme preparations of Î±-amylase enzymes were not appropriate to produce a large quantity of glucose, and whilst used commercial food amyloglucosidase preparation, produced a large quantity of glucose after the optimization process...|$|E
40|$|Wide {{range of}} {{application}} of enzymes allowed their use in many textile processes such as biopolishing, desizing and bleaching. Cellulase enzymes {{have been used for}} the biopolishing of cellulosic fibers and fabrics. In this work the focus was on two seperate applications of modified enzymes in textile processing, one is to retain strength of viscos during pilling process and the second is to combine desizing and the bleaching processes of the fabric. Cellulases are used to prevent pilling {{on the surface of the}} viscose fabric but they couse a loss in the tensile strength of the viscose fabric. Commercial celluloses were crosslinked using different parameters in an attempt to ameliorate the loss of tensile strength and to improve enzyme properties. Native and modified enzymes were characterized and their activities against CMC and their effects on the properties of viscose (such as pilling, bursting strength) fabric were determined. Effects of mechanical agitation and surfactants were examined. Crosslinking of cellulase was found to prevent the loss of strength due to the fact that larger enzyme complexes formed by crosslinking were minly resticted to the fabric surface. Enzymes are replacing the use of harsh chemicals in many of the textile processes such as desizind and bleaching and immobilizations of these enzymes on solid supports allow their recycling. Enzymatically produced peroxide is used for bleaching of the cotton fabrics. Commercial Glucosse oxidase (GOx) enzyme was immobilized on different supports such as alumina, silica, Sepharose 4 B and crosslinked enzyme aggragates of GOx were prepared. Their efficiencies against glucose substrate for the production of peroxide were analyzed. Moreover, the starch size of the cotton fabric is hydrolized into glucose by the action of amyloglucosidase and this liquor was also used to produce peroxide. The activities of immobilized enzymes and CLEAs against <b>desizing</b> <b>liquor</b> and the whiteness values of the cotton fabrics after bleaching were examined. The whiteness values reached with immobilized enzyme are not appropriate for white textile but is sufficient for further dyeing processe. Combination of desizing and bleaching in a single bath and recycling of the immobilized enzyme is an environmently friendly alternative...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the project}} was the {{development}} and testing of techniques for the elimination/minimization of the two most critical pollutants of the textile industry: Dyestuffs and sizing agents. The project was carried out in cooperation with 7 German and 7 Brazilian companies. The techniques, used for the elimination/degradation of dyestuffs, were: precipitation/flocculation/flotation, aerobic reactor, aerobic/anaerobic reactor, nanofiltration, chemical oxidation. They were tested in combination with representatives of 11 different types of dyestuff. The techniques realized a reduction of color of 90 % to 99, 9 %, of COD by > 80 % and of Nitrogen of > 90 %. The residual color is below the German DFZ-standards (Anhang 38). The reuse of the purified wastewater is possible, e. g. for rinsing or for the preparation of dye recipes. Limits are due to the salt content, which can be reduced further by reverse osmosis. Economy studies revealed under consideration of the expenses for water (2 R$/m" 3) and thermal energy a return on investment of around 2 years. The recovery of sizing agent was carried {{out for the first time}} in combination with starch based size formulations. This requires carboxymethylized types of starches (CMS), which were manufactured by two Brazilian suppliers on basis of Mandioca and corn. The exclusion of biological degradation requires certain measures during desizing and the storage of the <b>desize</b> <b>liquor</b> and of the regenerate. The recovery tests were carried out with CMS/PVA blends 80 / 20 within 6 cycles and with pure CMS within 10 sycles. The warps, sized with the regenerate, ran equally well as the ones, sized with the standard size formulation. The ROI for an UF-plant is between 0. 8 and 2. 0 years. (orig.)
