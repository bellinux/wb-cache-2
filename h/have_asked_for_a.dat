500|$|Though his {{offensive}} production declined in 2000–01, Bure's 27 goals was {{second on the}} team to Jarome Iginla's 31 and he finished third with 55 points. He became embroiled in a power struggle with his coaches, first Don Hay who was dismissed mid-season, and then Greg Gilbert, as both wanted him play a more defensive-minded game. [...] Bure struggled to adapt {{and at one point}} was held out of the Flames lineup by Gilbert in response. [...] Bure was rumoured to <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> trade out of Calgary, and the Florida Panthers (who had acquired Pavel), Buffalo Sabres and New York Rangers were among the teams who showed interest in his services.

500|$|The {{character}} of Adam Mitchell was first conceived, along with Henry van Statten, during Russell T Davies' 2003 pitch to the BBC, {{in a story}} heavily based on Robert Shearman's audio play Jubilee, which would later form the base for the episode [...] "Dalek". It was always {{the intention of the}} production team for Adam to join the TARDIS after Rose developed a liking for him. To play this role Langley was chosen, mostly because of his role on Coronation Street as Todd Grimshaw. He had auditioned for the role on the same day as doing publicity for his leaving storyline in Coronation Street. Reacting to his casting Langley, remarked that [...] "I couldn't <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> better next role because Doctor Who is another great institution."

Relying on the above case, the High Court held {{that it could not}} grant a mandamus in such terms. Instead, it quashed the Commissioner's decision and issued a mandamus directing him to [...] "consider and determine the application of the applicants according to law". Similarly, in Borissik v.

However, on 12 October 2012, the BBC released an animated storyboard entitled [...] "P.S." [...] that depicted the scene with narration by Darvill. It takes place one week later in Brian's timeline after [...] "The Power of Three" [...] when a man named Anthony delivers him a letter from Rory, telling him that they will never return and that Anthony is their son they adopted in 1946.

500|$|Speaking {{during the}} inauguration of an Islamic {{foundation}} in Kabul, Saleh said the Karzai government and the United States of America cannot represent the anti-Taliban Afghan civilians and initiate peace talks while simultaneously excluding them. The former Afghan Intelligence Chief insisted on considering {{the views of the}} Afghan people during the peace talks process, as a majority of Afghans both in the northern and southern regions, he said, have negative views of the Taliban. [...] He also questioned the honesty of the Taliban's involvement in peace talks. The recent objections by nearly all major opposition parties come amid growing efforts by the US and Hamid Karzai to make headway in secret talks with the Taliban and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami. In these talks representatives from the anti-Taliban United Front, which fought the Taliban from 1994 until 2001 and unites leaders representing roughly 60% of Afghanistan's population, are being excluded.

500|$|... "Sectionals" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics.

IGN's Eric Goldman rated the episode 9/10, calling it [...] "very satisfying", and Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times commended it as [...] "fine television." [...] James Poniewozik of Time wrote: [...] "I'm not sure I expected or wanted a feel-good ending out of the first half of Glee. But what we got from [...] "Sectionals" [...] left me feeling very good about where the show is going this spring." [...] In contrast, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger, felt that the episode brought too many storylines to a head at once, [...] "not allowing all to have as much impact as they might have had the big developments been spaced out". Sepinwall commented, however, that the acting and especially singing performances were [...] "uniformly strong." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Winds of Winter" [...] saw the {{departure}} of several cast members and recurring guest actors from the series. Notables included Dean-Charles Chapman, whose character, King Tommen Baratheon, committed suicide in the episode. Before appearing {{in the role of}} Tommen, which was originally portrayed by actor Callum Wharry, Chapman appeared in the third season of the series as Martyn Lannister, a minor character who was also killed off. Chapman stated that he found out about his character's death the night before the initial table read for the season, saying [...] "I was in my hotel, minding my own business, and I got a phone call. I picked up the phone, and instantly, I knew it was coming. It was David Benioff and Dan Weiss, the two creators of the show, and they stated the facts. But they did it really nice.

500|$|In October 2009, actress Barbara Windsor's {{decision}} to leave EastEnders after sixteen years of portraying the character Peggy Mitchell was announced. The show's executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood, {{said it was a}} massive honour for him to be responsible for the character's exit, but explained that as she has become the [...] "quintessential matriarch of the show", they had to get the exit storyline right, which he said would be [...] "both epic and poignant". Windsor gave one year's notice of leaving, giving the production team time {{to come up with a}} storyline, and was asked to keep her decision a secret until the announcement was made. Kirkwood looked at Windsor's first episode and decided her exit should be about Peggy and her son Phil, as Peggy's arrival came at a time when Phil needed her most, and since then, she had believed that Phil still needed her. Peggy's exit came when she realised his mother was not what Phil needed. Windsor did not want to know in advance how her character would leave, but hoped she would not be killed off. She commented: [...] "My exit was beautifully written and I really couldn’t <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> better send-off for Peggy." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weeklys PopWatch complimented the episode, {{writing that}} [...] "the series finale of Smallville did what {{it needed to}} do: It {{completed}} the circuit on an epic coil of story that began 10 years ago." [...] Jensen was critical {{of the first half}} of the episode, noting that the pre-marital tension between Clark and Lois did not bode well for the story. However, he felt that the last 10 minutes made up for the slow parts in the episode. He ultimately concluded that the finale was [...] "radically cornball and goosebumpingly geektastic, and the fanboy in me was satisfied". Chris Carabott of IGN awarded the episode a 9.5 out of 10, citing an [...] "amazing" [...] episode. He argued that it [...] "succeeded in delivering the moments we wanted to see" [...] and that [...] "this finale delivered some of the most memorable moments of the series and successfully transformed Clark Kent into Superman". Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic awarded the episode five stars out of five, calling its resolution [...] "breath taking". McHatton praised the ending, noting that, [...] "I couldn’t <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> better ending than those seven years in the future" [...] and that the final shot was the scene he [...] "always imagined Smallville could end with".|$|E

The {{customer}} is revealed to be Tom (a recurring character throughout the series), who is at first happy that he finally got his pizza, until he discovers {{he did not get}} the drink he claims to <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for.</b> <b>A</b> confused SpongeBob checks the order, which says that Tom didn't order a drink (although it is heavily implied that Mr. Krabs didn't hear Tom's order correctly or that he hung up before Tom had a chance to finish). His blood boiling with anger, Tom harshly berates SpongeBob and refuses to take the pizza or pay for it before slamming the door. SpongeBob goes back to Squidward and collapses to the ground and cries (while absorbing his tears). Infuriated that Tom berated SpongeBob and won't pay for the pizza all because of a missing drink (making the long journey and the ridiculous obstacles the duo went through a complete waste of time), Squidward confronts Tom who arrogantly says, [...] "Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't payin' for that!" [...] to which Squidward angrily claims, [...] "Well, this one's on the house!" [...] and brutally shoves the pizza into Tom's face as payback for his rudeness. Squidward then goes back to SpongeBob who, stilling crying, asks, [...] "Did he change his mind?" [...] Squidward cheers him up by saying, [...] "He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite." [...] The two then drive back to the Krusty Krab, which is comically revealed to be right across the street, much to Squidward's dismay, who then says [...] "Oh, my aching tentacles!".|$|E

On 1 July 2009, Digital Spy reported that Loui Batley had quit the soap and would leave {{towards the end of}} the year. Loui's decision matched co-worker Zoë Lister (Zoë Carpenter). The Hollyoaks website officially announced on 23 July 2009 that both Batley and Lister would leave towards the end of that year. Their final storyline was described as a [...] "A tragic curtain call for one of them", stating that either Sarah or Zoë would die. Batley wanted to quit the serial in December 2008 when her contract ran out. Kirkwood asked her to stay another six months with the promise of a good exit storyline. The plot also involved Zoe and Lydia Hart (Lydia Kelly). She made it clear to Kirkwood and new executive producer Lucy Allan that she would leave afterward. Allan then came up with the idea of writing Batley out of the serial in its sister show Hollyoaks Later. Upon hearing Kirkwood's ideas for her exit storyline, Batley said: [...] "I've been there for quite a while and it was a great ending for the character - I couldn't <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> better way to go..." [...] Hollyoaks Later producer Bryan Kirkwood said: [...] "Loui's been brilliant in Hollyoaks and she's massively underrated. She's been at the centre of some of the biggest storylines on the main show. She never turned in a performance less than top-notch and I wish she had a little more recognition for that. She's a very strong actress and it's been fantastic to work with her - and great to be involved in her exit." ...|$|E
