40|$|AbstractKv 2. 1 {{channels}} {{exhibit a}} U-shaped voltage-dependence of inactivation that {{is thought to}} represent preferential inactivation from preopen closed states. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying so-called U-type inactivation are unknown. We have performed a cysteine scan of the S 3 -S 4 and S 5 -P-loop linkers and found sites that are important for U-type inactivation. In the S 5 -P-loop linker, U-type inactivation was preserved in all mutant channels except <b>E</b> <b>352</b> C. This mutation, but not <b>E</b> <b>352</b> Q, abolished closed-state inactivation while preserving open-state inactivation, resulting {{in a loss of}} the U-shaped voltage profile. The reducing agent DTT, as well as the C 232 V mutation in S 2, restored U-type inactivation to the <b>E</b> <b>352</b> C mutant, which suggests that residues 352 C and C 232 may interact to prevent U-type inactivation. The R 289 C mutation, in the S 3 -S 4 linker, also reduced U-type inactivation. In this case, DTT had little effect but application of MTSET restored wild-type-like U-type inactivation behavior, suggestive of the importance of charge at this site. Kinetic modeling suggests that the <b>E</b> <b>352</b> C and R 289 C inactivation phenotypes largely resulted from reductions in the rate constants for transitions from closed to inactivated states. The data indicate that specific residues within the S 3 -S 4 and S 5 -P-loop linkers may play important roles in Kv 2. 1  U-type inactivation...|$|R
40|$|The {{activation}} of caspases {{is the principal}} event in the execution of apoptosis. Initiator caspases are activated through an autocatalytic mechanism often involving dimerisation or oligomerisation. In Drosophila, the only initiator caspase DRONC, is tightly inhibited by DIAP 1 and removal of DIAP 1 permits {{activation of}} DRONC by the Drosophila Apaf- 1 -related killer, ARK. ARK is proposed to facilitate DRONC oligomerisation and autoprocessing at residue <b>E</b> <b>352.</b> This study examines whether autoprocessing of DRONC is required for its activation and for DRONC-mediated cell death. Using purified recombinant proteins, we show here that while DRONC autocleaves at residue <b>E</b> <b>352,</b> mutation of this site did not abolish enzyme activation, DRICE-induced cleavage of DRONC or DRONC-mediated activation of DRICE. We performed a detailed mutational analysis of DRONC cleavage sites and show that overexpression of DRONC cleavage mutants in Drosophila cells retain pro-apoptotic activity. Using an in vitro cell-free assay, we found ARK alone did not activate DRONC and demonstrate a requirement for an additional cytosolic factor in ARK-mediated DRONC activation. These results suggest that, similar to mammalian caspase- 2 and caspase- 9, the initial cleavage of DRONC is not essential for its activation and suggest a mechanism of ARK-mediated DRONC activation different from that proposed previously.

40|$|Ideally, {{bioactive}} ceramics {{for use in}} alveolar ridge augmentation should {{possess the}} ability to activate bone formation and, thus, cause the differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells into osteoblasts at their surfaces. Therefore, in order to evaluate the osteogenic potential of novel bone substitute materials {{it is important to}} examine their effect on osteoblastic differentiation. 	 This study examines the effect of rapidly resorbable calcium-alkali-orthophosphates on osteoblastic phenotype expression and compares this behavior to that of beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) and Bioglass 45 S 5. Test materials were three materials (denominated GB 14, GB 9, GB 9 / 25) with a crystalline phase Ca 2 KNa(PO 4) 2 and with a small amorphous portion containing either magnesium potassium phosphate (GB 14) or silica phosphate (GB 9 and GB 9 / 25, which also contains Ca 2 P 2 O 7); and a material with a novel crystalline phase Ca 10 [K/Na](PO 4) 7 (material denominated <b>352</b> <b>i).</b> SaOS- 2 human bone cells were grown on the substrata for 3, 7, 14 and 21 days, counted and probed for an array of osteogenic markers. GB 9 had the greatest stimulatory effect on osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation suggesting that this material possesses the highest potency to enhance osteogenesis. GB 14 and <b>352</b> <b>i</b> supported osteoblast differentiation to the same or a higher degree than TCP, whereas, similar to Bioglass 45 S 5, GB 9 / 25 displayed a greater stimulatory effect on osteoblastic phenotype expression indicating that GB 9 / 25 is also an excellent material for promoting osteogenesis...|$|R

40|$|EAL domain {{proteins}} are {{the major}} phosphodiesterases for maintaining the cellular concentration of second-messenger cyclic di-GMP in bacteria. Given the pivotal roles of EAL domains in the regulation of many bacterial behaviors, the elucidation of their catalytic and regulatory mechanisms would contribute to the effort of deciphering the cyclic di-GMP signaling network. Here, we present data to show that RocR, an EAL domain protein that regulates the expression of virulence genes and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO- 1, catalyzes the hydrolysis of cyclic di-GMP by using a general base-catalyzed mechanism {{with the assistance of}} Mg 2 + ion. In addition to the five essential residues involved in Mg 2 + binding, we propose that the essential residue <b>E</b> <b>352</b> functions as a general base catalyst assisting the deprotonation of Mg 2 +-coordinated water to generate the nucleophilic hydroxide ion. The mutation of other conserved residues caused various degree of changes in the kcat or Km, leading us to propose their roles in residue positioning and substrate binding.

We have used various spectroscopic, computational and functional assays to characterize the properties of the T domain carrying the double mutation <b>E</b> 349 Q/D <b>352</b> N or the single mutation E 362 Q. Vesicle leakage measurements indicate that both mutants interact with the membrane under less acidic conditions than the wild-type. Thermal unfolding and fluorescence measurements, complemented with molecular dynamics simulations, suggest that the mutant E 362 Q is more susceptible to acid destabilization because of disruption of native intramolecular contacts. Fluorescence experiments show that removal of the charge in E 362 Q, and not in <b>E</b> 349 Q/D <b>352</b> N, is important for insertion of TH 8 –TH 9. Both mutants adopt a final functional state upon further acidification.

Biallelic PALB 2 variants cause Fanconi anemia, a recessive inherited chromosomal instability syndrome, while rare monoallelic variants of PALB 2 have been proposed to confer two-fold increased predisposition to breast cancer. To investigate the role of PALB 2 germline mutations in predisposition to breast cancer in the Malaysian breast cancer patient population and to determine its clinical significance, a total of 1220 breast cancer patients treated at University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) from January 2003 to December 2010 were recruited into the Malaysia Breast Cancer Genetic Study (MyBrCa). We selected 155 high risk individuals with either (a) diagnosed ≤ 50 {{years old and had}} at least one first- or second-degree relatives with breast cancer; (b) diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer with the primary cancer at age 50 or below; (c) diagnosed with male breast cancer at any age; (d) affected with both breast and ovarian cancers; (e) affected with both breast and pancreatic cancers; or (f) diagnosed with breast cancer and had at least one first-degree relative with pancreatic cancer. Of these, 33 individuals were screened positive for BRCA deleterious mutations, while 122 individuals lacked aberrations in both BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes. These 122 BRCA-negative individuals were then tested for PALB 2 germline mutations. Further screening for nine PALB 2 mutations/variants was conducted in 874 Malaysian and 532 Singaporean breast cancer patients, and in 1342 healthy Malaysian and 541 healthy Singaporean women. In-silico prediction of the pathogenicity of missense variants were conducted using both SIFT and Polyphen- 2. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the characteristics of PALB 2 mutation carrier relative to BRCA 1, BRCA 2 and non-carrier. We discovered two PALB 2 deleterious mutations (STOP 358 and S 869 X), ten missense variants (P 249 L, T 300 I, iv <b>I</b> 309 V, <b>E</b> <b>352</b> Q, D 498 Y, H 553 Q, Q 559 R, L 763 F, A 1017 T and E 1018 D) and one synonymous variant (S 689 S) from the sequencing of 122 BRCA-negative individuals. Genotyping of Asian recurrent PALB 2 mutations detected an additional PALB 2 carrier (STOP 353) among the unselected breast cancer patients.

Along with retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), HNF 4 α belongs to the nuclear receptor subfamily 2 (NR 2), characterised by a conserved arginyl residue and a glutamate residue insert in helix 7 (H 7) of the ligand binding domain (LBD). Crystallographic studies indicate that R 348 and <b>E</b> <b>352</b> residues in RXRα H 7 are involved in charge-driven interactions that improve dimerisation. Consistent with these findings, we showed that removing the charge of the corresponding residues in HNF 4 α H 7, R 258 and E 262, impaired dimerisation in solution. Moreover, our results provide a new concept according to which helices of the HNF 4 α LBD dimerisation interface contribute differently to dimerisation required for DNA binding; unlike H 9 and H 10, H 7 {{is not involved in}} DNA binding. Substitutions of E 262 decreased the repression of HNF 4 α transcriptional activity by a dominant-negative HNF 4 α mutant, highlighting the importance of this residue for dimerisation in the cell context. The E 262 insert is crucial for HNF 4 α function since its deletion abolished HNF 4 α transcriptional activity and coactivator recruitment. The glutamate residue insert and the conserved arginyl residue in H 7 most probably represent a signature of the NR 2 subfamily of nuclear receptors...|$|R
40|$|Myocilin, {{expressed}} in the trabecular meshwork of the eye, {{has been linked to}} inherited primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). The biological function of myocilin is unknown, but mutant myocilin exhibits a gain-of-function mechanism, aggregating within the endoplasmic reticulum of human trabecular meshwork cells, causing cell stress and eventually apoptosis. After apoptosis occurs, the trabecular meshwork is compromised, leading to an increase in intraocular pressure, a symptom of glaucoma. In this thesis, I have expressed and purified the wild-type olfactomedin (OLF) domain and 24 reported disease-causing variants. I developed a facile thermal stability assay using differential scanning fluorimetry, which follows the unfolding of a protein through the fluorescence of a dye sensitive to hydrophobic regions of a protein. Also in this thesis I have determined melting temperatures for the wild-type and for each of the disease-causing mutants. I have tested the stability of the mutants in the presence of seven osmolytes, with sarcosine and trimethylamine-N-oxide restoring the melting temperature closest to wild-type. Additionally, I expressed and purified three reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (<b>E</b> <b>352</b> Q, <b>E</b> 396 D, K 398 R), which are considered benign variants. Variants were also compared by circular dichroism, revealing high b-sheet content and wild-type structure. When compared to previous studies, there is a positive correlation between the melting temperature, and previously reported qualitative assays, which measure the mutant myocilin solubility in detergent, secretion from mammalian cells, and aggregation propensity. Taken together, these data give insight into the relationship between glaucoma genotypes and phenotypes.

40|$|Analysis of {{two ways}} of {{approaching}} the classics, apparently different but with underlying aspects in common, respectively {{in the fields of}} literature and visual art. In his lyric O Reginella (Myricae 2, 1892) Giovanni Pascoli uses the techniques of the Hellenistic and Roman poets, contaminating his literary sources and reusing epic models to describe the humble life of his rural characters: adopting the role of Odysseus in Od. VI, and combining fragments from three different passages (vv. 25 - 30, 62 - 65, 154 - 159), he addresses his makaismos to a girl (a new Nausicaa) who has stretched out her white laundry in the meadows. The theme of "Reginella", born from his readings of Homer, often returns in his poetic works (poems, letters, handwritten notes) : he adapts it to different poetic characters, sometimes imaginary, sometimes inspired by the figures of his real life. If Pascoli highlights its literary sources with a purposed allusive technique, in his painting Der Kuss (1907 - 1908) Klimt at first sight seems to hide them: the canvas is, in my opinion, inspired by the hierogamy of Zeus and Hera in Iliad XIV 341 - 351, whose archetypal value also {{stems from the fact that}} this is the first erotic scene in Western literature. All the details described by Homer are present here: the gold cloud that surrounds the lovers, the golden dew falling from the sky, the flowery meadow below them. Even a detail often ignored or misunderstood - the edge of cliff on which the two lovers are almost hovering - can find a more convincing explanation: the Hieros Gamos of the divine couple takes place on the Gargaron, the highest peak of Mount Ida (Il. XIV 292 s. <b>e</b> <b>352).</b> The Homeric scene, which inspired many ancient and modern artists, is here reinterpreted according to the personal style of the artist, who was attracted - at this stage of its production (the so called golden period) - by the myths of Zeus' loves: in the same years he painted Danae (1907 - 1908), impregnated by Zeus turned into a golden rain, and in 1917 Leda, who was loved by Zeus in the form of a swan...|$|R
40|$|We report 6 K-Ar {{ages and}} paleomagnetic data from 28 sites {{collected}} in Jurassic, Lower Cretaceous and Paleocene rocks of the Santa Marta massif, to test previous hypothesis of rotations and translations of this massif, whose rock assemblage differs from other basement-cored ranges {{adjacent to the}} Guyana margin. Three magnetic components were identified in this study. A first component has a direction parallel to the present magnetic field and was uncovered in all units (D <b>352,</b> <b>I</b> = 25. 6, k = 57. 35, a 95 = 5. 3, N = 12). A second component was isolated in Cretaceous limestone and Jurassic volcaniclastic rocks (D = 8. 8, I = 8. 3, k = 24. 71, a 95 = 13. 7, N = 6), and it was interpreted as of Early Cretaceous age. In Jurassic sites with this component, Early Cretaceous K-Ar ages obtained from this and previous studies are interpreted as reset ages. The third component was uncovered in eight sites of Jurassic volcaniclastic rocks, and its direction indicates negative shallow to moderate inclinations and northeastward declinations. K-Ar ages in these sites are of Early (196. 5 +/- 4. 9 Ma) to early Late Jurassic age (156. 6 +/- 8. 9 Ma). Due to local structural complexity and too few Cretaceous outcrops to perform a reliable unconformity test, we only used two sites with (1) K-Ar ages, (2) less structural complexity, and (3) reliable structural data for Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks. The mean direction of the Jurassic component is (D = 20. 4, I = - 18. 2, k = 46. 9, a 95 = 5. 1, n = 18 specimens from two sites). These paleomagnetic data support previous models of northward along-margin translations of Grenvillian-cored massifs. Additionally, clockwise vertical-axis rotation of this massif, {{with respect to the}} stable craton, is also documented; the sense of rotation is similar to that proposed for the Perija Range and other ranges of the southern Caribbean margin. More data is needed to confirm the magnitudes of rotations and translations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Animais que apresentaram maiores PMI foram vendidos mais cedo, obtendo menores TMP. Nos dois grupos foi observada uma tendência de queda no GMD com o aumento do TMP. Novilhos precoces obtiveram maior GMD, acarretando em um menor TMP em relação aos superprecoces. Com o aumento do TMP houve redução no GMD de ambos os grupos. Nos dois grupos, animais com maior PMI permaneceram confinados por menos tempo.    The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the relationship between age, weight, average weight gain and days on feed of beef steers slaughtered at 15 or 27 months of age. Four hundred and thirty two beef steers were divided in two groups: 267 younger steers (YY), confined at 12 and slaughtered at 15 months old; and 165 young steers (YS), confined at 25 and slaughtered at 27 months of age. Beginning weight (BW) was 296. 98 and 352. 04 kg to YY and YS, respectively (p < 0. 01). Steers were on feedlot until reach a minimum fat percentage, resulting on seven different values for DF. In the statistical analysis the BW and the DF were calculated as co-variables. YS reach higher AWG (1. 351 vs 1. 004 kg/day) and higher SW (441. 88 vs 388. 88 kg) (p < 0. 01) and lower (p < 0. 01) DF (66. 87 and 94. 20 days, respectively). Steers with higher BW were sold earlier, reaching lower DF. Both groups showed a decrease tendency of AWG as the DF increased. YS reached higher AWG, resulting in lower DF compared with YY. In both groups, while the DF increases, the AWG decreases. Steers with higher BW reached lower DF. ...|$|R

In the present study, polymorphism of pvama- 1 among Iranian isolates was investigated to generate useful information on this vaccine candidate antigen, which {{is required for the}} rational design of a vaccine against P. vivax. Blood samples were collected from P. vivax-infected Iranian patients during 2009 - 2010. Of 99 collected isolates, 37 were analyzed for almost the entire pvama- 1 gene using sequencing. The overall nucleotide diversity (π) was 0. 00826 ± 0. 0004 and the majority of polymorphic sites were identified in domain I (DI) of the pvama- 1 gene. Neutrality analysis using Tajima's D, Fu and Li's D* and F* and McDonald Kreitman tests showed a significant positive departure from neutral substitution patterns, indicating a possible balancing selection across the entire ectodomain and DI sequences of pvama- 1 gene. However, no evidence was found for the balancing selection in DII and DIII regions of Iranian PvAMA- 1. Also, 29 haplotypes with different frequencies were identified and the overall haplotype diversity was 0. 982 ± 0. 012. Epitope mapping prediction of PvAMA- 1 showed the potential B-cell epitopes across DI-DIII overlap with E 145 K, P 210 S, R 249 H, G 253 <b>E,</b> K <b>352</b> <b>E,</b> R 438 H and N 445 D mutations; however, no mutation has been found in intrinsically unstructured/disordered regions. The fixation index (Fst) estimation between Iran and the closest geographical sites such as India (0. 0707) showed a slight geographical genetic differentiation; however, the Fst estimation between Iran and Thailand (0. 1253) suggested a moderate geographical isolation. In summary, genetic investigation in pvama- 1 among Iranian P. vivax isolates indicates that this antigen showed limited antigenic diversity and most of the detected mutations are located outside B-cell epitopes. Therefore, the present results have significant implications in understanding the nature of P. vivax population circulating in Iran as well as in providing useful information for malaria vaccine development based on this antigen...|$|R

O objetivo desse trabalho foi avaliar a produção da alface (cv. Elba) e acúmulo de nitrato em hidroponia em função de níveis crescentes de N na solução nutritiva. Plantas de alface foram cultivadas em estufa telada da UFPB em Areia (PB), em solução nutritiva que continha níveis crescentes de N (11, 13, 15, 17, 19 e 21 mmol L- 1) por 25 dias. O delineamento utilizado foi inteiramente casualizado com quatro repetições. Foram avaliadas a produção total (PTT), produção {{comercial}} (PCM) e os teores de nitrato na matéria fresca da raiz, caule e folhas da alface. Não foram verificados efeitos significativos do incremento dos níveis de N na solução sobre a PTT e PCM, sendo obtidos valores médios de 357, 3 <b>e</b> <b>352,</b> 5 g/planta, respectivamente. A elevação dos níveis de N em solução resultou em incrementos nos teores de nitrato em todas as partes da alface, obtendo-se na dose máxima teores de 659, 623 e 615 mg kg- 1 de matéria fresca, para raiz, caule e folhas, respectivamente. Os máximos teores foliares de nitrato obtidos se encontraram abaixo do limite de risco para saúde humana. Lettuce {{production in}} hydroponic system presents growing expansion in Brazil, but {{still there are}} problems of quality and risk of nitrate accumulation. This work was carried out to evaluate the lettuce production and nitrate accumulation in hydroponic system depending on the increasing levels of nitrogen in the nutrient solution. The experiment was conducted in greenhouse of the Universidade Federal da Paraíba, Brazil. The lettuce plants were grown in nutrient solution containing increasing levels of N (11, 13, 15, 17, 19 and 21 mmol L- 1) during a 25 -day period. An entirely randomized design with four replications was used. Plant total yield (PTT), plant commercial yield (PCM) and nitrate contents in the fresh matter of roots, stems and leaves of the lettuce were evaluated. There were no significant effects of increasing levels of N in nutrient solution on PTT and PCM, average values of 357. 3 and 352. 5 g/plant being observed, respectively. The increased levels of N in nutrient solution increased linearly nitrate content on all lettuce parts. The nitrate content reached 659, 623 and 615 mg/kg in the fresh matter of roots, stems and leaves, respectively, at the highest N level. Nevertheless, the maximum nitrate content observed in leaves was far below the risk level for human health...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the various}} {{techniques}} to reconstruct or enlarge a deficient alveolar ridge, {{the concept of}} guided bone regeneration (GBR) has become a predictable and well-documented surgical approach. At present, autogenous bone grafts are preferably combined with barrier membranes. Using synthetic biodegradable bone substitute materials, however, is advantageous, since it avoids second-site surgery for autograft harvesting. A bone substitute for alveolar ridge augmentation must be rapidly resorbable and should undergo complete substitution by newly formed functional bone tissue in view of placing dental implants in such augmented sites. Compared to the bone substitutes which are currently clinically available, {{there is a significant}} need for bone substitutes which degrade more rapidly, but still stimulate osteogenesis at the same time. This has {{led to the development of}} novel, bioactive, rapidly resorbable glassy crystalline calcium-alkali-orthophosphate materials. This in vivo study evaluates the effect of two novel bioactive particulate calcium-alkali-phosphate bone substitute materials as compared to the currently clinically used material β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) on bone regeneration and expression of osteogenic markers after implantation in the sheep mandible. This was in addition to examining the biodegradability. Test materials were two glassy crystalline calcium-alkali-orthophosphates: first, a material with a crystalline phase Ca 2 KNa(PO 4) 2 and with a small amorphous portion containing magnesium potassium phosphate (material denominated GB 14) and second, a material with a novel crystalline phase Ca 10 [K/Na](PO 4) 7 (material denominated <b>352</b> <b>i).</b> These materials (grain size 300 - 350 µm) were implanted in the sheep mandible for 1, 4, 12 and 24 weeks to regenerate membrane protected critical size defects and were compared to β-TCP particles of the same grain size as well as autogenous bone chips. Empty defects, in which collagen sponges were utilized for stabilization of the blood clot, served as control. In this study a total of 34 sheep were used. In order to generate chronicle defects, the premolars and one molar were extracted bilaterally in the sheep mandible and critical-size defects 14 mm in width and 1 cm in height were created. After 8 weeks a reentry was performed, and the defects were augmented with the various bone grafting materials and covered with a titanium membrane. At implant retrieval the tissue samples were fixed in an alcohol based fixative. The specimens were then embedded in a resin which facilitated performing immunohisto-chemical analysis on hard tissue sections. 50 µm-sections were cut in a buccal - lingual direction using a Leitz 1600 sawing microtome. Sections were then deacrylized and immunohistochemical staining was performed using primary antibodies specific to collagen type I, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein, osteopontin and osteonectin in combination with the DAKO EnVision+TM Dual link System Peroxidase. Mayer's haematoxylin was used as a counterstain. Semi-quantitative analysis of the sections was performed. A scoring system quantified the amount of staining observed using light microscopy. A score of (+++), (++) and (+) corresponded to strong, moderate or mild, whereas a score of (0) correlated with no staining. Furthermore, histomorphometrical evaluation of the sections was performed. The bone area fraction, the particle area fraction as well as the bone-particle contact and the osteoid-particle contact was measured using a light microscope in combination with a digital camera and SIS Analysis software (Olympus, Germany). Additional specimens were prepared to scanning electron microscopy. Of the various grafting materials studied, GB 14 had the greatest stimulatory effect on bone formation and expression of osteogenic markers and displayed the best bone bonding behaviour, while exhibiting the highest biodegradability. This was true for all time points studied. At 24 weeks, GB 14 even facilitated greater bone formation (82. 3 %) than the autogenous bone chips (75. 6 %), which is a remarkable result, since autogenous bone is generally regarded as the gold standard. The material <b>352</b> <b>i</b> showed poor bone bonding behaviour and the lowest biodegradability thereby yielding a disadvantageous result. The TCP particles displayed a lower biodegradability than the GB 14 particles. Both bone bonding behaviour and biodegrability increased at the later time points. Overall, TCP displayed good osteoconductivity and facilitated regeneration of the critical-size defects, which is in agreement with other studies reported in the literature. The diagram displaying the results for the osteogenic marker expression shows that the curve for GB 14 has a similar shape compared to that for autogenous bone. Hence, it can be concluded that the process of new bone formation with GB 14 is comparable to that with autogenous bone chips with respect to molecular mechanisms and temporal pattern, i. e. time-dependent course of the respective diagram. Therefore, GB 14 can be regarded as a promising bone substitute material for pre-implantology alveolar ridge augmentation. In order to take this bone grafting material to the clinical arena, controlled clinical studies need to be performed. Application for CE approval is currenty underway...|$|R
