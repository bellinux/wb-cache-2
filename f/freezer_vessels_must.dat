40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} different management tools, particularly input and quality controls on Bangladesh’s industrial trawl fishery. Results show that the efficiency of industrial trawl fishery comes from multiple owner managed vessels, export oriented vessels and registered vessels that are mainly engaged in double rigger trawling. Results also indicate that <b>freezer</b> <b>vessels</b> with small storage capacity, using small gear are relatively less efficient. This study shows {{that there is no}} depletion or reduction in marine fish stock over the period and shrimp vessels are technically more efficient than fish vessels.

5000|$|<b>Vessels</b> <b>must</b> use all {{available}} means {{to determine the}} risk of a collision, including the use of radar (if available) to get early warning of the risk of collision by radar plotting or equivalent systematic observation of detected objects. (e.g. ARPA, AIS).|$|R
