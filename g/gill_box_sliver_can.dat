40|$|Abstract. The new {{technology}} {{is based on the}} original four-color <b>gill</b> <b>box,</b> and adding the application of the controller. On the one hand, achieve the <b>sliver</b> color’s order <b>can</b> be matched at will, and every single <b>sliver</b> <b>can</b> be changed about the color and length, and the length of changeover portion can be designed easily, so that the final product color can be achieved in a color from deep to shallow gradients, and also can be two colors that is one of them becomes shallow gradually while another color deepened gradually; on the other hand, achieve the ratio of the colored sliver is adjustable without basal sliver feeding. In the other words, on the premise of output sliver thickness to maintain constant, the cross-section’s color of the sliver is ensured to be any independent color of the four feeding <b>sliver</b> colors, you <b>can</b> also have two or more color combinations. Using this {{new technology}} to produce the gradient product has been very popular in foreign countries, but is still rare in the domestic market. So this new technology will have positive effect on textile field, it can provide more new opportunities to the textile enterprises...|$|R

5|$|One of the Techniques {{most popular}} {{features}} is the <b>Sliver</b> <b>Box,</b> an analogue of the Vent {{feature of the}} Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which allows readers to submit any comment they wish. Comments are submitted on the Techniques website and as many Slivers that will fit appear in the week's paper, usually in order of submission. Slivers are subject to minimal censorship, with only full names of non-public figures, personal information and strong profanities typically removed or altered. Other entries are occasionally removed or truncated, usually in cases of spamming of the Sliver submission system. According to the paper, the Box is used to fill empty room left between advertisements {{in order to maintain}} a modular layout style. It is not uncommon for students to have conversations using the <b>Sliver</b> <b>Box.</b> <b>Slivers</b> were originally comments made by editorial board members during deadline night and were placed in narrow boxes ("Slivers") at the bottom of each page. Comments made on deadline night and opinions of editorial board members still occasionally find their way into the <b>Sliver</b> <b>Box.</b>|$|R

5000|$|At {{the time}} of its closure in April 1981, Coldharbour Mill still had its textile {{machinery}} in position. The majority of these machines have been preserved (though not all are exhibited), and have been augmented with weaving machines rescued from the closure of the Tonedale site. The lowest part of the site, the level 1 combing shed, dealt with the initial cleaning and combing of the unwashed wool. The process involved a number of separate stages, each with a specialised machine. The eight opening gill machines (made by Taylor Wadsworth & Co)opened up the fleeces and prepared the wool for washing in a large back-washer with steam heated rollers. Following the washing, further <b>gill</b> <b>boxes</b> produced successively combed fibres, which were passed to a circular Noble combing machine. This machine separated the fibres into long [...] "Tops" [...] and the short poor quality fibres. Although these machines are preserved on site, they are no longer in use today. British wool tops are purchased in, dyed into standard colours, and then up to ten strands of tops are fed into the Intersecting <b>Gill</b> <b>Box</b> (manufactured by Prince Smith and Stells in 1959). The <b>gill</b> <b>box</b> starts the process of drawing out the fibres, and also enables new colours to be created by blending together the standard colours. The output of the <b>gill</b> <b>box</b> is termed a sliver. This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant. The next process is to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to strengthen the resulting slubbing such that it can be wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the slubbing is for double knitting yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|R
25|$|The machines, {{known as}} boxes, {{in the drawing}} section reduce the combed tops from thick slivers to thinner roving ready for spinning. This is done by {{drafting}} them between slow back rollers to faster front rollers, and controlling the fibres between these rollers. The first boxes where the ends are thickest are the double head can <b>gill</b> <b>box</b> (where the wool ends up in a can) and the 2-spindle <b>gill</b> <b>box</b> (where the wool ends up twisted and on spindles). On these machines the rollers are heavily fluted to control the sliver, and the front rollers padded with leather to cushion the wool. Between {{the front and back}} rollers are fallers or bars which control the roving by holding it with fine pins. The roving is now called slubbing which needs twist for strength, and is dealt with by a second set of boxes: a 2-spindle draw-box, 4-spindle weigh box, 8-spindle finisher/reducer and 8-spindle rover. In these boxes the principle of two sets of rollers with controlled fibre in between is the same, but the yarn is now twisted onto a bobbin via a flyer.|$|R
50|$|All {{spinning}} machines, whether ring or open-end, need yarn joining {{to repair}} breaks or start new <b>sliver</b> <b>cans.</b> Joining the yarn {{has historically been}} a labor-intensive activity {{and a source of}} quality defects. Autopiecing units are robots that automate this process. Market leaders like Schlafhorst, Rieter, Savio, have machines that incorporate good quality autopiecers and autodoffing. This automation leads to less material handling costs and helps improve quality of the final product.|$|R
50|$|In {{early days}} large {{machines}} were equipped with less distance between rotors (gauge of machine). This led to creeling of very small cans, which required frequent can changes. Each can change requires {{a break in}} the yarn. All major manufacturers currently allow cans up to 18” diameter leading to less breakage, less joining of yarn, hence better quality and higher productivity. Originally round cans were used. Rectangular cans are used because they double sliver capacity in the same <b>sliver</b> <b>can</b> footprint.|$|R
50|$|In general, combing is done {{to filter}} or sieve out any short length fibers (for example, fibers shorter than 21 mm). Combing or carding is a primary process, {{followed}} by the gilling process, which removes hooks and involves three separate machines. Combing is then followed by two gillings to remove irregularity in the sliver and randomize fiber ends. This post-combing process is required if spinning is to follow. It is known that a <b>sliver</b> <b>can</b> be spun to a yarn of only 21 fibers with a suitable average length of 150 mm.|$|R

25|$|The combed slivers {{produced}} on {{any type of}} combing machine are passed through {{a process known as}} finishing. This process takes place in a series of <b>gill</b> <b>boxes</b> in which the fibres are redistributed, the slivers made uniform in thickness and moisture added in order to give the wool its natural suppleness and condition. Blending is done where necessary to keep the top up to a given standard of quality and, if dyed, consistency of colour. The top ball produced is suitable for packing for transport and unwinding. The top represents the wool comber's finished product, and it is in this form that the wool is bought and sold as the spinner's raw material.|$|R
50|$|Use of an offset in a fitted blade {{allows the}} tool to cut flush with a surface. This is {{particularly}} useful when fitting flooring along a skirting board, cutting the skirting {{to allow the}} board to slide under for a neat finish. The small form of these tools {{and the ability to}} mount the blade/accessory in any orientation allows cutting in areas previously unreachable. The ability to cut a complex or precise recess without the need to remove the work piece from where is it fixed greatly increases productivity. Small and precise cuts are possible even on end grain, a small <b>sliver</b> <b>can</b> be easily removed from timber cut too long for a perfect fit.|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{simulations}} {{can benefit}} {{a lot from}} an appropriate damping approach. For example, the stability is improved and a larger time step can be chosen. Furthermore, badly shaped meshes, e. g. containing sharp angles or <b>slivers,</b> <b>can</b> be handled if a proper damping approach is used. However, it must be ensured that the damping forces do not change the global movement of the object, i. e. they have to preserve linear and angular momentum. In this paper, we present a novel damping approach {{that is based on}} iterative spring damping to further improve the stability. We show that the resulting forces can be computed directly without actually performing the iterations. The approach does not require any connectivity information about the object and therefore, it can be used for arbitrary object representations. Further, it is independent of the integration scheme and the deformation model. The approach provides a simple parameter setting and guarantees that the damping forces do not overshoot. Finally, we illustrate that our approach allows for larger time steps compared to existing damping methods...|$|R
40|$|Designing of lifting, {{pushing and}} pulling {{activities}} {{based on the}} physical and physiological capabilities of the operators is essential. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze manual material handling (MMH) working posture of the operators using 3 D Static Strength Prediction Program (3 DSSPP) software and to identify major areas causing long last injury of operators. The research has investigated the fit between the demands of tasks and the capabilities of operators. At the existing situations, the actual capabilities of operators have been computed with the help of 3 DSSPP software and compared with NIOSH standards. Accordingly, operators' working posture is at an unacceptable position that exposes them for musculoskeletal disorders. Then, after the improvement of the design of MMH device (cart's roller), the result showed that the forces required by the operators to push and pull the <b>sliver</b> <b>cans</b> have been reduced from 931. 77 Newton to 194. 23 Newton. Furthermore, improvement of MMH cart's roller has reduced the awkward posture of operators and the risk of musculoskeletal disorders.

Financing came through private donations, and those who donated were awarded tickets to the inaugural game against Western Kentucky University. Over the years, WMU continued adding seating to the stadium, and a renovation in 1989 pushed the available seats to 30,200.

The six leading coaches were immovable. The engine crews and the express train's guards, the sleeping car attendants, some platelayers from a hut a short distance up the line and a shepherd whose home was nearby tried desperately to rescue the trapped passengers but were eventually driven back by thick smoke.

40|$|ABSTRACT: SLIVER {{cells are}} thin, {{single-crystal}} silicon solar cells fabricated using standard fabrication technology. SLIVER modules, composed {{of several thousand}} individual <b>SLIVER</b> cells, <b>can</b> be efficient, low cost, bifacial, transparent, flexible, shadow-tolerant and lightweight. Compared with current conventional PV technology, mature SLIVER Technology will need less than 10 % of the pure silicon, and fewer than 5 % of the wafer starts per MWp of factory output. There are two distinct challenges for SLIVER technology: devising a robust cell fabrication method for high yield, high efficiency SLIVER cells, suitable for transfer to industry; and handling, electrically interconnecting, and encapsulating billions of SLIVER cells at low cost. We have recently fabricated SLIVER cells with efficiencies exceeding 20 % using an optimised process. We {{believe this is the}} first commercial thin crystalline-type technology to reach 20 % efficiency. We believe there is a path to laboratory cell efficiencies of 22 % and commercially-produced cell efficiencies of 21 %. A 100 MWp SLIVER factory will produce several billion individual SLIVER cells annually. We have developed a sub-module technology for rapid, reliable, and low-cost assembly of arrays of SLIVER cells to form two main types of conventional solar cell analogues that, because of their appearance, we call “Rafts ” and “Sheets”. Using our invention, Rafts and Sheets can be reliably produced at high speed using low-cost equipment and entirely conventional materials, and can be assembled into solar power modules using simple adaptations of conventional solar cell handling and stringing equipment...|$|R
40|$|Three {{seasons of}} {{fieldwork}} at Charlie Lake Cave, British Columbia, have revealed {{a sequence of}} stratified deposits that spans the Late Pleistocene and entire Holocene. Analyses of sediments, radiocarbon dates, faunal remains, and artifacts show that the site was first occupied by people at about 10 500 B. P., when local environments were more open than today. By 9500 B. P., boreal forest had moved into the area, and human use of the site was minimal until about 7000 B. P., when a brief occupation of the site probably included a human burial. Use of the site intensified after about 4500 B. P., possibly because the cave became more accessible. The site was used both as a residential base camp and as a more temporary hunting station or lookout.   Article Summary by Jonathan C. Driver, May 2015   After we had completed our excavations in 1991 {{we decided that we}} should focus on writing up what we had excavated, and not undertake further excavations at the site. This paper was written to summarize our state of knowledge about the archaeological remains at the site, and focused on describing the stone tools, the overall stratigraphy, and the dating. The stratigraphic summary replaced earlier work based on the 1983 excavations, {{and we were able to}} refine our dating of the site as a result of more radiocarbon dates. The different cultural periods were based mainly on the work done by Martin Handly for his M. A. thesis at Trent University. The long list of authors reflects the need for a team approach to archaeological work, and include the project directors (Knut Fladmark and Jon Driver), stone tool analysis and development of the cultural sequence (Martin Handly), animal bone analysis (Randall Preston and Jon Driver), sediment analysis (Greg Sullivan and Knut Fladmark), and radiocarbon dating (Erle Nelson). The most important aspect of the site is that it preserves a very rare record of humanly made artifacts dating from the end of the last ice age (at least 10, 500 BC) to very recent times. The many layers at the site allow us to separate the different cultural periods. Good preservation of bone allowed us to submit radiocarbon dates that provide approximate ages for the various cultures that used the site. The artifacts that exhibit the most change through time are projectile points – the sharp stone tips for spears, darts and arrows. In much of western Canada it is difficult to date archaeological sites, because many of them are found in shallow soils where radiocarbon dating is difficult for two reasons. First, animal bone is often not preserved due to the acidic nature of the soils. Second, although charcoal is often found, it cannot be reliably associated with human activity, because natural forest fires also produce charcoal. As a result, archaeologists look at the style of the projectile points to assign approximate ages. Tse’K’wa provides an opportunity to link artifacts of different styles to radiocarbon dates in a site with many distinct layers. So Tse’K’wa is a foundation for understanding the sequence of different cultures in the region. The article also discusses the possible early presence of microblade technology. Microblades are the most efficient way of producing a cutting edge when the base technology is chipped stone. A small piece of high-quality raw material (known as the core) is shaped in such a way that numerous parallel-sided <b>slivers</b> of stone <b>can</b> be removed. These “microblades” can then be hafted in wood or antler to form knives or arrow barbs. The concept is rather like our utility knives that have replaceable blades. This technology allows people to carry small quantities of high quality stone with them, ensuring that they always have a sharp blade available. Not all archaeologists agree that the early microblade core from Tse’K’wa is part of this technology, because it doesn’t conform to the classic methods of core manufacture. However, we argue that evidence for the removal of microblades is very obvious, and the lack of classic core preparation is because of the tabular nature of the raw material. The paper also introduces some information about animal bones, including the raven burials, evidence for environmental change, and the presence of collared lemming. These topics were subsequently explored in more detail in other papers...|$|R
