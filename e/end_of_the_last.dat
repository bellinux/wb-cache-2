At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> Ice Age, {{the glaciers}} left behind a uniform plain with valleys eroded by the Mahoning River {{crossing}} the plain. Lakes created by glaciers that dammed small streams were eventually drained, leaving behind fertile terrain.|$|E

It was a fitting way to send off long-serving coach Robbie Deans before he departed to coach Australia. It was also the last game for Crusaders stalwarts Caleb Ralph and former captain Reuben Thorne. In July that year former captain Todd Blackadder was appointed Crusaders coach, and his former teammates Mark Hammett and Daryl Gibson were appointed as assistants.|$|E
5|$|Although {{underlain}} by {{much older}} Triassic age formations that protrude to form what would {{once have been}} islands—such as Athelney, Brent Knoll, Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor, which is composed of Blue Lias, the lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000years, following the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ice age. As the sea level changed following the Pliocene era, vegetation was laid down which was later converted into peat. The peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> episode, Wirt and Greg {{wake up in}} a hospital, with Greg {{telling a}} story but being cut off before we can hear what it's about.

5|$|Horse remains {{dating to}} the later part of this period– roughly coinciding with the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> glacial period– have been found at Farndon Fields, Nottinghamshire, dating from around 12,000BC. Mother Grundy's Parlour, also in Creswell Crags, {{contains}} horse remains showing cut marks indicating that hunting of horses occurred there around 10,000BC. A study of Victoria Cave in North Yorkshire produced a horse bone showing cut marks dating from about the same time.|$|E

5|$|Although the camas {{pocket gopher}} is {{fiercely}} defensive when cornered, {{it may become}} tame in captivity. While population trends are generally stable, threats to the species' survival include urbanization, habitat conversion for agricultural use and active attempts at eradication with trapping and poisons. It is prey for raptors and carnivorous mammals, and host to several parasitic arthropods and worms. Scientists believe that the gopher's evolutionary history was disrupted when the Missoula Floods washed over the Willamette Valley at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ice age. The floods almost completely inundated its geographic range, which may have caused a genetic bottleneck as survivors repopulated the region after the waters receded.|$|E
5|$|Although {{underlain}} by {{much older}} Triassic age formations that protrude to form what would {{once have been}} islands—such as Athelney, Brent Knoll, Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor—the lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000years, following the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ice age. Glastonbury Tor is composed of Upper Lias Sand. The Poldens and the Isle of Wedmore are composed of Blue Lias and Marl, while the Mendips are largely Carboniferous limestone. Although sea level changes since the Pliocene led to changes in sea level and the laying down of vegetation, {{the peak of the}} peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of human {{settlement}} of the Americas, the California condor was widespread across North America; condor bones from the late Pleistocene have been found at the Cutler Fossil Site in southern Florida. However, at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> glacial period came the extinction of the megafauna {{that led to a}} subsequent reduction in range and population. Five hundred years ago, the California condor roamed across the American Southwest and West Coast. Faunal remains of condors have been found documented in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas. The Lewis and Clark Expedition of the early 19th century reported on their sighting and shooting of California condors near the mouth of the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> glacial period, Indiana's {{topography}} {{was dominated}} by spruce and pine forests and was home to mastodon, caribou, and saber-toothed cats. While Northern Indiana had been covered by glaciers, Southern Indiana remained unaltered by the ice's advance, leaving plants and animals that could sustain human communities. Indiana's earliest known inhabitants were Paleo-Indians. Evidence exists that humans were in Indiana {{as early as the}} Archaic stage (8000–6000 BC). Hunting camps of the nomadic Clovis culture have been found in Indiana. Carbon dating of artifacts found in the Wyandotte Caves of Southern Indiana shows humans mined flint there as early 2000 BC. These nomads ate quantities of freshwater mussels from local streams, as shown by their shell mounds found throughout southern Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{first entered}} {{what would become}} Indiana near the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ice age. The region around Harrison County was of {{particular}} value to the early humans because of the abundance of flint. There is evidence of flint mining in local caves as early as 2000BCE; the stone was used to produce crude tools. Passing migratory tribes frequented the area which was influenced by succeeding groups of peoples including the Hopewells and Mississippians. One flint-working and camping location {{is known as the}} Swan's Landing Archeological Site; it is among the most important Early Archaic archaeological sites anywhere in eastern North America. Permanent human settlements in the county began with the arrival of American settlers in {{the last decade of the}} 18thcentury.|$|E
25|$|Ireland was {{inhabited}} sometime {{shortly after}} <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> Ice Age, approximately 10,000 – 8000 BC Conservative estimates place <b>the</b> arrival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first humans in County Wexford as occurring between 5000 BC – 3000 BC, {{referred to as}} the Mesolithic period in Ireland, though they may have arrived slightly earlier. Its proximity to Britain and Europe means that County Wexford was probably one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earliest areas <b>of</b> Ireland to be inhabited by humans. Evidence of this period is scarce and much remains to be discovered through Archaeology and Research.|$|R

5|$|Penry-Jones {{announced}} {{his intention to}} leave the series in December 2007, while it was later announced Armitage would join. Norris and Raison were both asked to return after their characters were left open for return after the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> series. In developing the series, the producers wanted to repeat the serialised style from series six, and settled on using the resurgence of Russia as the primary storyline, as they felt that at the time, the resurgence is in subtle ways threatening {{the security of the}} west. The producers also participated in several meetings with the writers to discuss the purpose of Sugarhorse. Filming started in London in March 2008, and later finished on August in the same year, in Moscow, the first time in series history where Spooks was filmed outside the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Saruman {{makes his}} final {{appearance}} at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> volume, The Return of the King (1955), after Sauron's defeat. After persuading the Ents to release him from Orthanc, he travels north on foot, apparently reduced to begging. He is accompanied by Wormtongue, whom he beats and curses. When they reach the Shire, Saruman's agents—both Hobbits and Men—have already taken it over and started a destructive process of industrialization. Saruman governs the Shire in secret {{under the name of}} Sharkey until the events of chapter 8 ("The Scouring of the Shire") in which Frodo and his companions return and lead a rebellion, defeating the intruders and exposing Saruman's role. Even after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo, Frodo lets him go. When Saruman blames Wormtongue for the damage done to the Shire and curses him, Wormtongue finally snaps and slits his master's throat.|$|E
5|$|Savary's {{return to}} port marked the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> attempt by a {{continental}} nation to land troops in Ireland. French losses in the operation were so severe that a repeat effort was never seriously contemplated. Similarly, the huge Irish losses during the rebellion, combined with British reprisals against the Irish populace, ended any hopes of reigniting the uprising in the near future. Most serious of all for the United Irishmen was the arrest of Wolfe Tone himself, who was discovered among the prisoners taken from Hoche at Buncrana. Tone was charged with treason and sentenced to death, though he committed suicide in Dublin before the sentence could be carried out.|$|E
