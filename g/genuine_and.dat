5|$|Extensive {{work was}} put into {{creating}} a <b>genuine</b> <b>and</b> historically correct atmosphere for the film. The facades of the houses of Mirabeau had to be replaced with painted polystyrene, {{to make them look}} older, and all electric wires were put underground. Meanwhile, in Vaugines, Berri planted a dozen olive trees twelve months before filming started, and watered them throughout the waiting period, and for the second installment planted 10,000 carnations on the farm.|$|E
5|$|Costume {{designer}} Anthony Powell {{found it}} a challenge to create Connery's costume because the script required the character to wear the same clothes throughout. Powell thought about his own grandfather and incorporated tweed suits and fishing hats. Powell felt it necessary for Henry to wear glasses, but {{did not want to}} hide Connery's eyes, so chose rimless ones. He could not find any suitable, so he had them specially made. The Nazi costumes were <b>genuine</b> <b>and</b> were found in Eastern Europe by Powell's co-designer Joanna Johnston, to whom he gave research pictures and drawings for reference.|$|E
5|$|Davidson's later {{career as}} a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His {{attempts}} at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles {{that he had not}} been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were <b>genuine</b> <b>and</b> that he did not deserve the humiliations he endured.|$|E

50|$|The play {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} with the Chicago Tribune saying {{the play was}} an unabashed wish fulfillment fantasy and pick of the week!, and Los Angeles Times added that it has <b>genuine</b> humor <b>and</b> <b>genuine</b> poetry <b>and</b> will bring {{a smile and a}} nice warm feeling to even the most jaded theatergoers. LA Weekly said this was fresh and original, and a wicked take on contemporary gay theatre.|$|R

5|$|Director Colin Campbell was {{concerned}} with the film's realism. He had sets constructed to represent the streets of Cairo, Baghdad, and Damascus, and used animals from the Selig Zoo. Scenes set in the Arabian and Sahara Deserts were filmed in the deserts of California. The Arab characters' clothing was <b>genuine,</b> <b>and</b> the actors portraying those roles were required to remain dressed in-character throughout the several days of desert filming to ensure they would appear more natural in the imported garments. Much of the film, including the desert scenes, was hand tinted. Production costs exceeded $35,000, the equivalent of over $ in present-day terms.|$|E
5|$|Gordianus {{had been}} Roman emperor {{for six years}} when Philip, with his son Philip, succeeded him. It is {{reported}} that he, being a Christian, desired, {{on the day of}} the last paschal vigil, to share with the multitude in the prayers of the Church, but that he was not permitted to enter, by him who then presided, until he had made confession and had numbered himself among those who were reckoned as transgressors and who occupied the place of penance. For if he had not done this, he would never have been received by him, on account of the many crimes which he had committed. It is said that he obeyed readily, manifesting in his conduct a <b>genuine</b> <b>and</b> pious fear of God.|$|E
5|$|In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio {{claimed to}} have {{discovered}} a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio. While this news was met with excitement at first, scholars—after reading the work—began {{to argue that the}} manuscript was a fraud, with humanist Antonio Riccoboni being among the most vocal. However, Sigonio continued to defend the work until his death, even mentioning in two different orations his belief in the truthfulness of the text. The scholar Latino Latini, however, later claimed in a letter that Sigonio had admitted to the forgery on his deathbed. By and large, the academic community concluded that the version of the Consolatio discovered was not <b>genuine,</b> <b>and</b> the document later earned the name the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio.|$|E

5|$|In a final {{gesture of}} love and comprehension, after a {{lifetime}} of despising his father's stories and his father as story-teller, Will finishes the story his father has begun, pulling together the themes, images and characters of his father's storied life to blend reality and fantasy in act of communion and care. By unselfishly releasing the anger he has held about his father's stories, Will gains the understanding that all we are our stories and that his father's stories gave him a reality and substance and a dimension that was as real, <b>genuine,</b> <b>and</b> deep as the day-to-day experiences that Will sought out. Will comes to understand, then, that his father—and the rest of us—are our stories and that the deeper reality of our lives may, in fact, not be our truest self.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the second investigation, a case was being prepared against Det Ch Supt Melvin and Det Insp Dingle. In July 1992 Melvin was charged with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and Dingle with conspiracy. In 1994 their lawyers applied for access to information from Nove's inquiry, {{on the grounds that}} it might help their clients; anything that implicated Winston Silcott would support the detectives' contention that their interview notes were <b>genuine</b> <b>and</b> that Silcott really had, in effect, confessed. The lawyers also argued that the detectives should not be prosecuted until all related criminal proceedings had concluded.|$|E

He tries again to illegally use Umbridge's office fire to communicate with the Order of the Phoenix's headquarters to make sure the vision was <b>genuine,</b> <b>and</b> is told by Kreacher the house-elf that Sirius is indeed at the Ministry, before Umbridge catches Harry and his friends in the act. Snape is summoned to provide Veritaserum in order to question Harry, but he claims to have no further stocks of the potion left. Remembering that Snape {{is also a member of}} the Order of the Phoenix, Harry gives him a cryptic warning about Sirius's fate, but Snape claims to have not understood it.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the eighth}} series in 1999, Doug Naylor has been {{attempting}} to make a feature-length version of the show. A final draft of the script was written, by Naylor, and flyers began circulating around certain websites. The flyer was <b>genuine</b> <b>and</b> had been distributed by Winchester Films to market the film overseas. Plot details were included as part of the teaser. It was set in the distant future where Homo sapienoids - a race of cyborgs— had taken over the solar system and were wiping out the human race. Spaceships that tried to escape Earth were hunted down until only one remained... Red Dwarf.|$|E
5|$|The elder Sellers was {{convinced}} {{the machine was}} a hoax. To validate his suspicions, he hired local engineer Isaiah Lukens to build a similar machine, using a hidden clockwork motor as a power source. They then arranged {{a demonstration of the}} machine to Redheffer, who was immediately convinced and offered to buy it. Meanwhile, Redheffer's machine appeared in the Philadelphia Gazette. Civil engineer Charles Gobort offered to bet sums of money ranging from $6,000 to $10,000 that the machine was <b>genuine,</b> <b>and</b> that Redheffer had discovered perpetual motion.|$|E
5|$|Khánh had {{a meeting}} with Lodge in the morning of the coup for around an hour after {{arranging}} a meeting through Wilson. Due to concerns as to whether Washington would express support for the coup and what the official policy was, the meeting was not held at the embassy but at the home of Lodge's aide Dunn. However, if Lodge was concerned about keeping a low profile regarding the coup, Khánh was not, arriving at Dunn's residence with seven jeeploads of aides before embracing Lodge. He told Lodge that he would go after the communists aggressively and that the coup would not disrupt the military in any significant way. Khánh vowed to intensify the war effort, ask Lodge for guidance constantly, introduce democracy and install a direct phone line between Vietnamese military headquarters and the US Embassy. Lodge also reported that Khánh wanted {{to give the impression that}} he seriously thought that neutralist deal involving de Gaulle was a <b>genuine</b> <b>and</b> ominous prospect, and that de Gaulle had made much progress in influencing the previous administration.|$|E

5|$|Quatermass II {{received}} positive newspaper {{reviews in}} the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, although the BBC's Radio Times listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt {{it to be}} {{not as good as}} the original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in Haverfordwest who was concerned that she would never find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to Ireland {{to spend the rest of}} her life in a convent; she wondered if the BBC could possibly write to her and let her know how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was <b>genuine,</b> <b>and</b> allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline's conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.|$|E
