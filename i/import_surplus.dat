50|$|As regards trade imbalance, only Constantinople ran an <b>import</b> <b>surplus.</b> Both Lampe and McGowan {{argue that}} the empire as a whole, and the Balkans in particular, {{continued}} to record an export surplus throughout the period. The balance of trade however moved against the Ottomans from the 18th century onwards. They would re-export high value luxury goods, mainly silks from the Far East and exported many of its own goods. Luxury goods began being imported. Through the 18th century, exports moved to unprocessed goods whilst {{at the same time}} commodities were imported from European colonies. Most of these commodities were produced by slave labour undercutting domestic production. However, according to most scholars, a favourable balance of trade still existed {{at the end of the}} 18th century. 19th century trade increased multi-fold, however exports remained similar to 18th century levels. Foodstuffs and raw materials were the focus with carpets and raw silk appearing in the 1850s. Although the basket of exports remained generally constant, relative importance of the goods would vary considerably.|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{establish}} the development of foreign trade in the Muscovite lands, the Baltic provinces and in the areas which were newly settled in the mid eighteenth century with particular reference {{to the role of}} British merchants in these changes. This has required an analysis of the structure of trade through the 'Russian' Baltic and White Sea ports and an investigation of the changing patterns of commercial acitivity caused by fluctuations in the boundaries of their supply areas and of internal and external markets for the goods they handled. Detailed consideration has been given to the commodities handled in the import, export and re-export trades utilising data from the Sound Toll accounts together with British and Russian customs statistics. Having established a wide framework for the investigation of Russian foreign trade, detailed consideration has been given {{to the role of the}} British commercial community. In order to do so it has been necessary to reconstruct the methods used by British merchants in Russia in organising their commercial activities: this includes examining the structure of the British mercantile 'houses' in all the Russian ports, but especially in St. Petersburg; the patterns of recruitment of young men into the trade and their style of life in Russia; the network of contacts which they established among their compatriots, whether involved in commerce or other professions, with other foreign merchants and also with their aristocratic clients and their Russian counterparts involved in internal trade. Merchants in the Russia trade faced changing costs to their business for freight, insurance and customs duties and the fluctuations in these charges and their responses to them have been assessed. One of the most important aspects of their activities was the way in which they financed their trade. Decision-making in this matter was influenced by events throughout Europe as well as in Russia, for account had to be taken of the relative value in silver of the commodities which the Russia merchant handled in that country and elsewhere. Thus, during the late seventeenth century, they paid for Russian goods in specie whilst increasingly in the eighteenth century it made better economic sense to deal in imported commodities as far as the market allowed and finance the balance with trade surpluses accumulated elsewhere, thereby causing the emergence of a close co-operation between the British and Dutch communities in Russia in financing their trade, with the Dutch lending the proceeds of their <b>import</b> <b>surplus</b> to the British in return for bills of exchange on Amsterdam. The costs arising from the movement of the rate of exchange and interest rates within the financial network so formed, have been fully inves¬ tigated and their effect on the trade explored. The effects of these changes on Russia's overseas trade and the internal impact of the development of this external commercial sector to the Russian economy receives especial consideration with particular emphasis being placed on the response of the aristocracy in both their changing patterns of consumption of imported goods and in the development of their estates to provide raw materials for export or supplying Russian merchant and serf manufacturers who were at this time responding to growing overseas markets for their products...|$|E

40|$|The major {{countries}} of the former Soviet Union-specifically Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan-are becoming increasingly important in world agricultural markets. The two main developments are that this region has become a large grain exporter, especially of wheat and barley, and Russia a big agricultural importer, especially of meat. These trends should continue for the next decade. However, policies to expand the livestock sector could mitigate these developments, as increased domestic meat production would reduce both meat <b>imports</b> and <b>surplus</b> feed grain for export.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{a problem}} of influence of trade exchange between free market and non parametric economies on a market disequilibrium level in the latter ones. Having the assumption made that a non-parametric economy is burdened with a permanent supply disequilibrium, by means of internal structural conditioning the author attempts to define ruling causalities for foregn trade in that situation. In his opinion imports from market economiees are the emergency measures used in order to remove the most acute market shortages in the macro scale. But in those instances terms of contracts are changing to the worse. The final result is a certain loss in supply increment in the internal market, which is normally gained by imports. The following part of the article discusses a case of exports, having the assumption made of balanced trade. The author advocates that a permanent inclining for intervention imports yields the pression on balance which effects too extensive gain of internal demand created {{in the process of}} export production. All in all the foreign trade when stimulated by demand disequilibrium becomes a factor fostering that disequilibrium. Upon revoking the assumption of balanced trade, the author discusses the case of trade with the <b>imports</b> <b>surplus</b> {(Poland, the former decade) and next, estimates the effect of trade with the exports surplus on the level of demand disequilibrium (Poland after 1981). The finali part of the article consists of the attempt at defining factors which can diminish the action of the presented mechanism of aggravating (demand disequilibrium by means of foreign trade with market economies.

40|$|The {{geographical}} {{locations of}} Tell Atchana and Kinet Höyük between the Eastern Mediterranean region, North-Syria and South-Anatolia define {{them as a}} focal point of cultural and economic relations between these regions. One of the aims of this archaeobotanical study, {{which is based on}} the plant macro-remains from Kinet Höyük and Tell Atchana, is to contribute to the knowledge of the economic position of these settlements during the Late Bronze Age. It is of interest under which conditions the crops were grown, which general agricultural techniques were used, (e. g. soil management, fallowing etc.) as well as how and where crop-processing and storage were conducted within both settlements and how they compare to other relevant sites in the area. The main socio-economic question of this archaeobotanical study is whether crops were primarily brought to Tell Atchana and Kinet Höyük from neighbouring regions with trade relations or grown in their immediate vicinities by the inhabitants themselves or farmers from surrounding villages. The environment and its development under anthropogenic influence and natural factors is also focus of this investigation, as it defines the possibilities of cultural developments of Tell Atchana and Kinet Höyük during Late Bronze Age. In order to answer the mentioned questions, 33 samples from Kinet Höyük and 35 samples from Tell Atchana were studied. About 3350 seeds and fruits were identified, counted and grouped into 77 categories, which include plant species or types belonging to 20 families. Statistical analysis indicates that the organisation of agriculture in the stratified society of Tell Atchana, as far as plant production is concerned, is similar to north-eastern Syrian sites. Tell Atchana probably <b>imported</b> <b>surplus</b> food from surrounding villages and supported large-scale, but also small-scale specialised crop production. In Late Bronze Age Kinet Höyük there is evidence for intensification in large-scale agriculture, with a broad spectrum of crop plants, as a kind of risk-buffering.

In the specification and analysis of a world rice market import demand function, Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Instrumental Variables (IV) with Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), and Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) methods have been used. Social welfare effects have been obtained using consumer surplus and compensated variation for the top four rice importing countries (Indonesia, Philippines, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia). Empirical results suggest that economic growth, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), and importing countries’ population positively affect national income, thus, positively affecting rice consumption. Oil price has a strong effect on the domestic rice prices in importing countries.

40|$|The euro {{currency}} {{is facing a}} crisis which raises doubts about Euro-trade area survival (Barber, 2010). Among the European Union member states, Southern European countries (including Ireland), currently face a difficult economic situation (Barber, 2010). There is evidence of a large gap between ‘North’ and ‘South’ Europe in terms of trade balance as Germany and the Netherlands have a strong export surpluses, while the southern countries have faced strong import penetration in the last decade. It is argued that the latter countries should adopt severe austerity measures (Zaidi, 2010), imposed by the EU according to the stability and growth pact of Dublin (Turrini, 2004). The application of austerity measures implies reforms towards making the labour market more flexible and achieving downward wage flexibility (Berthold, 1999). We focus our attention on the relations between labour markets, innovation activity and trade within the EMU (European Monetary union). Investments in Research and Development (R&D) {{have a positive impact}} on exports (Kleinknecht, 2002). It is argued that this relation is also valid in the opposite direction; that export drives innovation. There is therefore a mutual link: “winners keep winning”. Conversely, <b>import</b> <b>surpluses</b> have a negative impact on innovation, and limited investments on innovation have a negative impact on export: “losers keep losing”. Against this background, we have doubts about the austerity measures imposed by the European Union. We focus our attention particularly on the effects of export performance influenced by an increase in the flexibilization of the labour market and we assume that an easy ‘hire and fire’ of the employees has several effects in terms of acquiring or losing ‘tacit knowledge’ in an organization (Andriessen, 2005). Tacit knowledge and innovation activity are strictly intertwined (Senker, 2008) and we address innovation activity from a Schumpeterian perspective (Breschi, Malerba et al. 2000). The two Schumpeterian innovation models (small entrepreneurial firms and large organizations) will be defined and a taxonomy aimed to classify the innovation activity of an organization is developed. We argue that an increase in labour flexibility has opposite effects on the two Schumpeterian innovation models, and there is evidence of this relation in the taxonomy tables, showing a link between the degree of labour turnover inside an organization and the Schumpeterian taxonomy. We argue that governmental reforms related to the labour market at the macro-level, might have opposite effects at the firm-level in terms of export performance, depending on whether a firm shows typical Schumpeter I or Schumpeter II characteristics. In order to investigate the validity of our theory, ten hypotheses have been formulated and tested through the data analysis of the OSA database, a collection of data from 1300 Dutch companies collected over the last two decades. Four econometric models are formulated with particular attention addressed to the impact of variables indicating labour flexibility or labour turnover and their interaction with the two Schumpeterian innovation models on export performance. This research is aimed at investigating the relations between export performance and its determinants, such as R&D intensity and labour flexibility as key determinants. The determinants of export performance are derived from a survey of the theoretical and empirical literature. According to the observations and the empirical analysis of the results, significant determinants of export performance are addressed as well as recommendations and limitations for firms. The main result of the data analysis is the positive relation between a high level of flexible labour and export performance in typical Schumpeter I firms. In other words, firms showing typical Schumpeter I characteristics and adopting a high level of labour flexibility are more successful exporters. On the other hand we find a negative relation between a high level of flexible labour and export performance in typical Schumpeter II firms. In other words, firms showing typical Schumpeter II characteristics that adopt a high level of labour flexibility, are less successful exporters. This raises some doubts about the effectiveness of the austerity measures imposed by the EU. Such reforms could paradoxically have harmful consequences for the long-term export performance of Mediterranean countries and cause even deeper problems.

40|$|Many early {{cities in}} the ancient Near East lay in and regions where canal {{irrigation}} was unfeasible and rainfed agriculture was prone to low yields and crop failure. One city, preserved as the ruin mound of Tell es-Sweyhat in northern Syria, lay in one of northwestern Mesopotamia 2 ̆ 7 s most marginal environments for dry farming. Nevertheless, archaeological excavations reveal Sweyhat grew from a small village to a fortified city during the Early Bronze Age (3100 – 2000 BC). Land-use studies and archaeological surveys suggest that, at its height, the city 2 ̆ 7 s population easily surpassed its maximum agricultural potential. Unlike other contemporary northern Mesopotamian cities, the inhabitants could not readily <b>import</b> grain <b>surpluses</b> from a rural hinterland due to geographic and environmental conditions. Yet urban Sweyhat, likely the seat of a powerful city-state, continued to flourish {{for at least a}} century. Recent archaeological excavations and textual analyses indicate sheep-goat pastoralism and the exploitation of steppe resources were important subsistence activities. Sweyhat likely served as the center of a highly integrated agropastoral economy specializing in pastoral production. ^ To investigate this possibility, the author added pastoral production to the current model of Sweyhat 2 ̆ 7 s subsistence economy using modern studies of small ruminant production in Syria. To gather data on the ancient pastoral economy, the author excavated one of the earliest permanent settlements in the Tell es-Sweyhat region and conducted an archaeological reconnaissance of the Balikh-Euphrates uplands. ^ This study reveals that pastoral production as a wholly subsistence activity is at best a break even proposition; however, it provides a means of exploiting seasonal pastures and pockets of arable land in the uplands and provides wool—an exportable commodity. Upland settlement patterns mirror the riverine zone. The earliest settlements in the Sweyhat region were fortified centers for storing barley and had extremely low resident populations. During the 3 rd millennium BC, a growing emphasis on producing pastoral surpluses is evident. Surpluses were achieved through the intensification of dry farming in the Sweyhat embayment and the concomitant extensification of pastoralism through rangeland improvement. ...|$|R
40|$|Although the GATT is emblematic among {{multilateral}} agreements in pursuing {{the removal of}} trade restrictions, it includes {{a considerable number of}} exceptions that allow the WTO Members to impose new ones. Art. XXVIII permits the WTO Members, upon negotiations with specified categories of other Members, to withdraw or increase the binding tariff rates on certain products listed in their Schedules of concessions. As these new arrangements are conducted outside a Round of multilateral negotiations, which is the traditional context for reciprocation of tariff concessions, they are called “renegotiations”. Art. XXVIII is thus prominent among the GATT exceptions, since it is designed to counteract what is considered as the core of the GATT obligations, notably the commitment under Art. II not to increase tariffs listed in the Schedules of concessions. GATS Art. XXI is analogous to Art. XXVIII, though it differs from the GATT provision in some procedural respects. Clearly enough, the rationale underlying Art. XXVIII is to provide the WTO Members with some flexibility in their liberalisation commitments. Tariff concessions made in the course of multilateral Rounds might become unexpectedly burdensome after consolidation. Some mechanisms for the adjustment of tariff commitments were thus introduced in the GATT to relieve the WTO Members from <b>import</b> <b>surpluses.</b> The renegotiation procedure envisaged in Art. XXVIII is perhaps the principal of these mechanisms but not the exclusive one. The “emergency action on imports of particular products” provided for in Art. XIX and the additional tariff flexibilities to be granted to developing countries in order to protect infant industries according to Art. XVIII are other relevant examples of adjustments of tariff commitments in the interval between two Rounds of multilateral negotiations. Unlike Articles XVIII and XIX, Art. XXVIII does not require the WTO Member willing to withdraw or increase its tariff rates to produce evidence of the negative effects of the existent rates on its domestic market. Art. XXVIII was conceived as a tool to be used by the WTO Members in the ordinary run of multilateral trade and not under the pressure of special or emergency domestic circumstances, such as a crisis of production or the establishment of an infant industry. In order to discourage WTO Members from recurring to renegotiations routinely – an occurrence which would seriously undermine the GATT predictability –, the drafters of Art. XXVIII assigned to the major trading partners of the Member seeking modification or withdrawal with respect to the product concerned a right to compensation or, as a last resort, a right to counter-retaliate. Most of Art. XXVIII provisions are procedural. According to Art. XXIV: 6, these same procedures are to be followed by those WTO Members which raise their binding tariffs {{as a result of their}} entrance into, or implementation of, a regional trade agreement creating a customs union. The establishment of a common external tariff on certain products, which is intrinsic to the economic pattern of a customs union, is indeed likely to lead one or more of the separate customs territories forming a customs union to raise their tariffs with a view to make them uniform to the common external tariff. Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) usually do not have a provision similar to GATT Art. XXVIII, while, for example, all of them contain a safeguard clause such as the one provided in GATT Art. XIX. In general, instances of recourse to Art. XXVIII have considerably decreased in number over the years. As from 1958, renegotiations started to be predominantly conducted under Art. XXVIII: 5. The gradual shift to this modality of renegotiations is easy to understand: under this provision, the WTO Members can act with a relative freedom, since they have neither to respect the time-limit of Art. XXVIII: 1 neither to obtain the authorization prescribed by Art. XXVIII: 4. As in practice the right of retaliation has been exercised very rarely, it is to be presumed that the negotiations on compensation have been successful on average. However, there could have been other reasons which might have deterred the WTO Members from resorting to retaliations. Principally, they might have feared that third WTO Members, i. e. Members other than the Member having originally withdrawn or modified its concessions, could at their turn counter-counter-retaliate, withdrawing or modifying concessions of exporting interest for the Members having taken retaliatory actions first. Since, as illustrated above, a concession must be withdrawn or modified on a MFN basis, there is, as a result, an inherent difficulty in effectively implementing the retaliation provision of Art. XXVIII: 3...|$|R
40|$|Increasing water {{scarcity}} has posed a major constraint to sustain food production {{in many parts}} of the world. To study the situation at the regional level, we took Iran as an example and analyzed how an intra-country "virtual water trade strategy" (VWTS) may help improve cereal production as well as alleviate the {{water scarcity}} problem. This strategy calls, in part, for the adjustment of the structure of cropping pattern (ASCP) and interregional food trade where crop yield and crop water productivity as well as local economic and social conditions are taken into account. We constructed a systematic framework to assess ASCP at the provincial level under various driving forces and constraints. A mixed-integer, multi-objective, linear optimization model was developed and solved by linear programming. Data from 1990 – 2004 were used to account for yearly fluctuations of water availability and food production. Five scenarios were designed aimed at maximizing the national cereal production while meeting certain levels of wheat self-sufficiency under various water and land constraints in individual provinces. The results show that under the baseline scenario, which assumes a continuation of the existing water use and food policy at the national level, some ASCP scenarios could produce more wheat with less water. Based on different scenarios in ASCP, we calculated that 31 % to 100 % of the total wheat shortage in the deficit provinces could be supplied by the wheat surplus provinces. As a result, wheat deficit provinces would receive 3. 5 billion m 3 to 5. 5 billion m 3 of virtual water by <b>importing</b> wheat from <b>surplus</b> provinces...|$|R
