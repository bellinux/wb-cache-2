50|$|An <b>international</b> private <b>leased</b> <b>circuit</b> (IPLC) {{functions}} as a point-to-point private line. IPLCs are usually time-division multiplexing (TDM) circuits that utilize the same circuit amongst many customers. The nature of TDM {{requires the use of}} a CSU/DSU and a router.

50|$|The e-network {{is made up}} of a large undersea {{cable network}} and {{satellite}} connectivity provided through C-Band transponders of the INTELSAT-904 or RASCOM satellites. A Hub Earth Station of the project, located in Senegal, is connected to the participant universities and super specialty hospitals, through an <b>International</b> Private <b>Leased</b> <b>Circuit</b> (IPLC) that links it to a submarine cable landing station in India. Each partner nation from Africa has a tele-education terminal, a telemedicine terminal and a VVIP communication node for the head of State linked to the network. The network, designed to have 169 terminals and a central hub that delivers services, uses state of the art technology that is compatible with broadband technologies like Wi-Fi and WiMax. The network can also be scaled up to support increases in user numbers and to cater to different applications. The project is being implemented by the Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL) which is responsible for the project's design, operationalisation and maintenance. A data centre at its office in New Delhi acts as a hub for all Indian sites. As a precursor to e-Network project, a pilot project was successfully undertaken in Ethiopia in 2006 that provided education services from IGNOU at New Delhi and telemedicine services from CARE Hospital, Hyderabad.|$|R

40|$|Data {{delivery}} in the Deep Space Network (DSN) involves transmission {{of a small}} amount of constant, high-priority traffic and a large amount of bursty, low priority data. The bursty traffic may be initially buffered and then metered back slowly as bandwidth becomes available. Today both types of data are transmitted over dedicated <b>leased</b> <b>circuits.</b> The authors investigated the potential of saving money by designing a hybrid communications architecture that uses <b>leased</b> <b>circuits</b> for high-priority network communications and dial-up circuits for low-priority traffic. Such an architecture may significantly reduce costs and provide an emergency backup. The architecture presented here may also be applied to any ground station-to-customer network within the range of a common carrier. The authors compare estimated costs for various scenarios and suggest security safeguards that should be considered...|$|R
