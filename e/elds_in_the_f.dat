40|$|Introduction The University of Melbourne {{entered the}} RoboCup contest for <b>the</b> rst time <b>in</b> 2000, <b>elding</b> teams <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>F</b> 180 and Sony Legged Leagues. This paper {{describes}} {{certain aspects of}} our <b>F</b> 180 team: <b>the</b> MuCows. The MuCows played three (ocial) matches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course of RoboCup 2000. The scores were as follows: won 14 : 0 against the 4 Stooges (University of Auckland, NZ); lost 0 : 7 against Big Red (Cornell, USA); lost 0 : 1 against CFA (UPMC, France). <b>The</b> score-line <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rst match, against NZ, reects <b>the</b> dierences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> technology employed by the two teams. NZ was at a great disadvantage from the outset {{as a result of}} their decision to use local (on-board) rather than global (overhead) vision. While their robots had diculty nding the ball, our robots had access to accurate global state information (obtained from an overhead camera). Consequently, this match was eectively a test of the MuCows' ability to score against an open goal. The second match, against Cornell, w...|$|R

For centrally directed gravitation therefore both the metric compatibility condition and the tetrad postulate are accurate experimentally to one part in one hundred thousand.

Its e ectiveness strongly depends on the strength and distribution of magnetic <b>eld</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> separator. It is economical to use Halbach permanent magnet arrays to create a suitable magnetic eld, since they do not change their properties during separation and do not need electrical energy. During real magnetization process, however, there can be a problem with correct orientation of their magnetization vector.

Quantum eld theory with external conditions (QFEXT) is the investigation framework of quantum phenomena related to the presence of a given classical background.

40|$|Abstract: Flow elds within {{turbines}} {{are generally}} three-dimensional and unsteady. Typically, <b>the</b> ow- <b>elds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interaction zone between the last {{stage and the}} diffuser are strongly inhomogeneous. This non-uniformity strongly limits the downstream diffusion process, so that signi cant improvement {{can be achieved by}} making <b>the</b> total pressure <b>eld</b> <b>in</b> this zone more uniform. One way to achieve this is by using kinks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> endwall contours and, if necessary, one or two splitters. The use of balance-based space averaging and modelling procedures can help to characterize these ows, and to develop an optimum interaction zone and diffuser geometry. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> study described here, as an example the interaction zone of high-pressure/ intermediate-pressure (HP/IP) and low-pressure (LP) diffusers of steam turbines were numerically and partly experimentally optimized for a xed blading and exhaust. The operating conditions were also kept constant except that for low pressures the ow eld was studied for a range of back pressures (i. e. exhaust velocities). The optimization process starts with an initial ow <b>eld</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interaction zone generated numerically or experimentally. Using these data a design procedure is applied that creates both a much more uniform total pressure eld at the last stage exit and a diffuser geometry possibly with one or two splitters and proven for an earlier LP design experimentally. It was demonstrated that, depending on the inhomogeneity of the ow from the upstream stage, a performance improvement of several percentage points could be achieved...|$|R
