5|$|Others {{have argued}} that the {{cemetery}} represents a fusion of Christian and pagan Saxon customs. It was not {{until the end of the}} 7th century that the practice of burying people in consecrated ground around a church became the norm. There are examples of known Christians being buried in an ostensibly pagan fashion, as was the case for the late 7th century Kentish princess Eormengyth, sister of the abbess of Minster-in-Thanet. She was buried in a traditional tumulus a mile east of her sister's minster. John Blair argues that the Church in early Saxon England may have tolerated Christians being given pagan burial rites due to the 'Christianising' effect this would have <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pagan site. This would have been consistent with the advice given by Pope Gregory the Great in 601 that Saxon shrines should be converted to Christian use, rather than being destroyed, and that pagan festivals and rites should be converted into Christian ones. On this interpretation, the cemetery may symbolise the continuity between the pagan past and the increasingly Christianised present.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd Webber wrote a Requiem Mass {{dedicated}} to his father, William, {{who had died}} in 1982. It premiered at St. Thomas Church in New York on 24 February 1985. Church music had {{been a part of the}} composer's upbringing and the composition was inspired by an article he had read about the plight of Cambodian orphans. Lloyd Webber <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> number of occasions written sacred music for the annual Sydmonton Festival. Lloyd Webber received a Grammy Award in 1986 for Requiem in the category of best classical composition. Pie Jesu from Requiem achieved a high placing on the UK pop charts. Perhaps because of its large orchestration, live performances of the Requiem are rare.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, Gale applied these {{principles}} {{to the development}} of airborne forces. An advocate of shock manoeuvre with elite forces, Gale stressed extensive training, the use of the latest battlefield technologies and strong personal leadership. For Gale, the quality of one's military forces were as important as their number, and he drew additional lessons on the disproportionate effect that surprise manoeuvre <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 'demoralised or unprepared enemy', as opposed to a 'well-trained opposition', from the operations of his own 6th Airborne Division in Normandy. Later in life, Gale examined the issues of war in the nuclear age. Still an advocate of manoeuvre and high-quality forces, Gale was to stress the importance of achieving mobility and flexibility {{in the face of the}} Soviet threat, foreshadowing in many ways the evolution of the AirLand battle doctrine of the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|In {{obedience}} to the Books of Destiny, some strange and unusual sacrifices were made, human sacrifices amongst them.

They were lowered into a stone vault, which <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> previous occasion also been polluted by human victims, a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings. When the gods {{were believed to be}} duly propitiated... Armour, weapons, and other things of the kind were ordered to be in readiness, and the ancient spoils gathered from the enemy were taken down from the temples and colonnades. The dearth of freemen necessitated a new kind of enlistment; 8,000 sturdy youths from amongst the slaves were armed at the public cost, after they had each been asked whether they were willing to serve or no. These soldiers were preferred, as there would be an opportunity of ransoming them when taken prisoners at a lower price.|$|E

A further four films followed in 1943, one of which promoted war propaganda while the other two displayed the popular medium of cine-variety. Cine-variety introduced Robey to the Astoria in Finsbury Park, London, a venue which was used to huge audiences and big-name acts and was described as [...] "a super-cinema".|$|E
500|$|Operation Kufire was {{a wide-ranging}} {{operations}} to track communists from various countries across Latin America {{who had come}} to Guatemala during the presidency of Jacobo Árbenz. The CIA expected that these individuals would return to their home countries, or to other countries that had liberal policies about political asylum, and by tracking them, the CIA hoped to disrupt their activities. During the course of this operation, a CIA analyst asked Atlee Philips whether to open a file on a 25-year old physician, who did not at the time appear to be particularly threatening. Atlee Philips said yes, thereby opening a file on Ernesto [...] "Che" [...] Guevara, which would quickly become one of the thickest files the CIA <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single individual.

30|$|After {{confirming}} that increasing {{weight in the}} communication layer is very likely an intermediate stage preceding the formation of ties in the nomination, we can observe how some edges in the nomination layer emerge gradually over time, from mere collocation to communication finally leading to nomination as cognitively salient contact.

[...] The film, co-starring Hershey's domestic partner, David Carradine, and produced by Roger Corman, was Martin Scorsese's first Hollywood picture. Shot in six weeks on a budget of $600,000, Boxcar Bertha {{was intended to be}} a period crime drama similar to Corman's Bloody Mama (1970) or Bonnie and Clyde (1967). Although Corman publicized it as an exploitation piece with plenty of sex and violence, Scorsese's influence made it [...] "something much more." [...] Roger Ebert, of the Chicago Sun-Times, wrote of the film's direction, [...] "Martin Scorsese has gone for mood and atmosphere more than for action, and his violence is always blunt and unpleasantnever liberating and exhilarating, as the New Violence is supposed to be."

In their 1975 book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler said that together Lennon, Harrison, Starr, Voormann and Preston constituted what had been considered [...] "the New Beatles" [...] {{around the time of the}} break-up. With regard to [...] "I'm the Greatest", they added: [...] "Not surprisingly, it is the most Beatlesque cut on the album, with economical bass figures, jangling guitar arpeggios (and a wicked little flashback to 'Sgt Pepper' therein)." [...] Peter Doggett writes that whereas Lennon's 1970 version had reflected his emotional pain and bitterness, once given to Starr the song became [...] "a sardonic tribute to the Beatles" [...] that [...] "sounded like a lost gem from the Abbey Road sessions". While identifying Harrison's guitar arrangement as the main reason for its Beatle sound, Simon Leng cites [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] as [...] "the most compelling example" [...] of the transformative effect that Harrison's contributions <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Lennon or McCartney song.|$|E

Speaking about the post-production process in January 2016, the Russo brothers said, [...] "This has been the easiest post process we've ever <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> film. We're very happy with how the movie was. Everyone is very happy with where the movie was. For us, the tricky thing is the effects because it's a very complicated movie and there are some really big sequences in the film. The effects are on a much larger scale than the work we did on Winter Soldier. That's the part that becomes really difficult because you don't have a lot of time and everyone has very high standards. So everyone starts killing themselves at this point...we'll be done with the movie in two and a half months."
