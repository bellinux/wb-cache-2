The original manga was republished in bunkoban format twice; Chuokoron-Shinsha released it from October 18, 1994, to April 18, 1995, in fourteen volumes, and Shueisha released <b>it</b> <b>between</b> June 18, 2002, and October 18, 2002, in ten volumes. The series has been localized in Italy by Panini Comics and published under its Planet Manga line.|$|E
5|$|After Tolkien's death, his son Christopher {{published}} {{a series of}} works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including The Silmarillion. These, together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and Middle-earth within <b>it.</b> <b>Between</b> 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings.|$|E
5|$|Decommissioned in 1854, {{the castle}} was first leased, and later bought outright, by the Royal Yacht Squadron {{to form their}} new clubhouse. The Squadron then {{employed}} the architect Anthony Salvin to rebuild large parts of <b>it</b> <b>between</b> 1856 and 1858. It became the headquarters {{for part of the}} D-Day invasion force during the Second World War, but has otherwise remained in use by the Squadron and is a distinctive landmark in yacht races along the Isle of Wight.|$|E

5|$|George placed B.telmatiaea in {{subgenus}} Banksia {{because its}} inflorescence {{is a typical}} Banksia flower spike, section Oncostylis because it has hooked styles, and series Abietinae because its inflorescence is roughly spherical. He considered its closest relative to be B.leptophylla (Slender-leaved Banksia), which differs from B.telmatiaea in having longer leaves and larger flowers; yet in his arrangement he placed <b>it</b> <b>between</b> B.scabrella (Burma Road Banksia) and B.laricina (Rose-fruited Banksia).|$|E
5|$|Highway60 was {{designated}} in 1937 between Huntsville and Lake Dore, near where it met Highway41. During the 1940s, the route {{shared a common}} termini with Highway41 at Golden Lake. When Highway41 was extended north to Pembroke in 1957, Highway60 was routed along <b>it</b> <b>between</b> Golden Lake and Eganville. It was extended east to Highway17 in downtown Renfrew circa 1961. It was extended further east when Highway17 was rerouted around Renfrew in 1977, establishing the current route.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle East, British {{counter-intelligence}} {{was directed}} at preserving the loyalty of the Indian sepoy {{in the face of}} Turkish propaganda and the concept of The Caliph's Jihad, while a particularly significant effort {{was directed at}} intercepting the Kabul Mission. The East Persian Cordon was established in July 1915 in the Sistan province of Persia to prevent the Germans from crossing into Afghanistan, and to protect British supply caravans in Sarhad from the Damani, Reki and Kurdish Baluchi tribal raiders who may have been tempted by German gold. Among the commanders of the Sistan force was Reginald Dyer who led <b>it</b> <b>between</b> March and October 1916.|$|E

5|$|The first {{documentary}} {{record of the}} castle dates from 1086 and further evidence is limited until the 13th century. Robert's son, William, rebelled against William Rufus in 1106, who confiscated the castle. Reginald de Dunstanville held <b>it</b> <b>between</b> 1141 and 1175, and it passed to the then Prince John when he acquired {{the title of the}} Count of Mortain in 1189, and then passed back {{into the hands of the}} Crown after John's rebellion against his brother, Richard I, in 1191.|$|E
5|$|The {{relief is}} {{displayed}} in the British Museum in London, which has dated <b>it</b> <b>between</b> 1800 and 1750BCE. It originates from southern Mesopotamia, but the exact find-site is unknown. Apart from its distinctive iconography, the piece is noted for its high relief and relatively large size, which suggest that it {{was used as a}} cult relief, making it a very rare survival from the period. However, whether it represents Lilitu, Inanna/Ishtar, or Ereshkigal is under debate. The authenticity of the object has been questioned from its first appearance in the 1930s, but opinion has generally moved in its favour over the subsequent decades.|$|E

5|$|The {{similarities}} of yttrium to the lanthanides are {{so strong}} that the element has historically been grouped with them as a rare-earth element, and is always found in nature together with them in rare-earth minerals. Chemically, yttrium resembles those elements more closely than its neighbor in the periodic table, scandium, and if physical properties were plotted against atomic number, it would have an apparent number of 64.5 to 67.5, placing <b>it</b> <b>between</b> the lanthanides gadolinium and erbium.|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} control and improve administration, various schemes {{to divide the}} work of the Roman Emperor by sharing <b>it</b> <b>between</b> individuals were tried between 285 and 324, from 337 to 350, from 364 to 392, and again between 395 and 480. Although the administrative subdivisions varied, they generally involved a division of labour between East and West. Each division was a form of power-sharing (or even job-sharing), for the ultimate imperium was not divisible and therefore the empire remained legally one state—although the co-emperors often saw each other as rivals or enemies.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} Matchette Road, where ramps {{provide access}} {{to and from the}} eastbound and westbound lanes of the expressway, respectively, the opposing lanes of the expressway split to the south of Malden Park. The eastbound lanes diverge south and cross the Herb Gray Parkway, sandwiching <b>it</b> <b>between</b> the E. C Row Expressway. Ramps provide access between the two parallel freeways before the parkway diverges and travels under the E. C. Row to the west of Huron Church Road. The expressway curves east-northeast and crosses Huron Church and becomes sandwiched between residential subdivisions. After interchanges with Dominion Boulevard and Dougall Avenue, the route crosses the Canadian National (CN) Caso subdivision railway lines and briefly passes through an industrial area.|$|E

5|$|At 4:00p.m., two {{anti-tank}} teams {{joined the}} Sa'iqa {{company on the}} firing ramp. Both teams, along with the company, were ordered to advance eastward and seize the crossroads. At around 5:00p.m., the Israeli Air Force began attacking Egyptian forces in the fort and {{on the west bank}} of the canal. One group of four aircraft attempted to bomb the fort; the first aircraft dropped its payload of seven bombs, then descended to a low altitude to escape anti-aircraft fire. An anti-air platoon at the Kilometer 17 mark soon shot down an Israeli aircraft (either a Mirage III or an A-4 Skyhawk) with a Strela 2 missile, destroying <b>it.</b> <b>Between</b> 6:00 and 7:00p.m. all bunkers and troop shelters inside the fort were cleared, and the Egyptians transferred 26 Israeli prisoners to {{the west bank of the}} canal, and thereafter transferred them to Port Said for intelligence gathering. The Israelis concentrated heavy artillery fire against the fort, once they were sure it had been captured by the Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on June 14 the Spanish fleet {{bore down}} off the Giglio Island in a line astern with the galleons and the galleys at the {{forefront}} and 8 lagging vessels closing the formation. Admiral Brézé formed his fleet in a line shortly after, alternating galleons and galleys, and sailed westward in a gentle breeze, closed with Linhares' ships. At 9:00 PM. Brézé had approached four miles to the Spanish, when, due to the lightness of the wind, the galleons of the two fleets had to be towed by the galleys while awaiting to be at windward. Brézé, aboard his flagship Grand Saint-Louis, {{stood in front of}} the line flanked by Vice-admiral Louis de Foucault de Saint-Germain Beaupré, comte du Daugnon's la Lune and Rear-admiral Jules de Montigny's le Soleil. His ship was in tow of Lieutenant-General Vinguerre's Patrone galley. Fifteen other vessels composed the French line of battle, each one towed by a galley. Montade's six-ship division was left in reserve. Both fleets sailed along each other until Linhares, thanks to the superior number of galleys that he had, gained the windward and was able to move towards the French line, attempting to overrun its line to catch <b>it</b> <b>between</b> two fires. Linhares had in tow Pimienta's flag galleon Santiago; don Álvaro de Bazán del Viso, general of the Neapolitan galleys, the galleon Trinidad, flagship of Admiral Pablo de Contreras; and Enrique de Benavides, general of the Sicilian galleys, other large Spanish galleons.|$|E
5|$|Attempts to date it have {{undergone}} similar shifts of opinion. In the 19th century the panel {{was believed to}} be an early work by Jan completed as early as c. 1410, although this view changed as scholarship progressed. In the early 20th century, Ludwig von Baldass placed it around 1424–29, then for a long period it was seen as originating from the early 1430s. Erwin Panofsky provided the first detailed treatise on the work and placed it around 1432–34. However, following research from Meyer Schapiro, he revised his opinion to the late 1430s in the 1953 edition of his Early Netherlandish Painting. A 1970s comparative study of van Eyck's 1437 Saint Barbara concluded that Madonna in the Church was completed after c. 1437. In the 1990s, Otto Pächt judged the work as probably a late van Eyck, given the similar treatment of an interior in the 1434 Arnolfini Portrait. In the early 21st century, Jeffrey Chipps Smith and John Oliver Hand placed <b>it</b> <b>between</b> 1426 and 1428, claiming it as perhaps the earliest extant signed work confirmed as by Jan.|$|E

5|$|Dunston Power Station {{refers to}} a pair of {{adjacent}} coal-fired power stations in the North East of England, now demolished. They were built on the south bank of the River Tyne, in the western outskirts of Dunston in Gateshead. The two stations were built on a site which is now occupied by the MetroCentre. The first power station built on the site was known as Dunston A Power Station, and the second, which gradually replaced <b>it</b> <b>between</b> 1933 and 1950, was known as Dunston B Power Station. The A Station was, in its time, {{one of the largest in}} the country, and as well as burning coal had early open cycle gas turbine units. The B Station was the first of a new power station design, and stood as a landmark in the Tyne for over 50years. From the A Station's opening in 1910 until the B Station's demolition in 1986, they collectively operated from the early days of electricity generation in the United Kingdom, through the industry's nationalisation, and until a decade before its privatisation.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium {{had been}} {{predicted}} by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869 and Henry Moseley measured in 1914 the effective nuclear charge by X-ray spectroscopy to be 72, placing <b>it</b> <b>between</b> the already known elements lutetium and tantalum. Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy {{were the first}} to search for the new element in zirconium ores. Hafnium was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark, validating the original 1869 prediction of Mendeleev. There has been some controversy surrounding the discovery of hafnium {{and the extent to which}} Coster and Hevesy were guided by Bohr's prediction that hafnium would be a transition metal rather than a rare earth element. While titanium and zirconium, as relatively abundant elements, were discovered in the late 18th century, it took until 1923 for hafnium to be identified. This was only partly due to hafnium's relative scarcity. The chemical similarity between zirconium and hafnium made a separation difficult and, without knowing what to look for, hafnium was left undiscovered, although all samples of zirconium, and all of its compounds, used by chemists for over two centuries contained significant amounts of hafnium..|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp's orbital {{position}} was calculated as 7.2astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, placing <b>it</b> <b>between</b> Jupiter and Saturn and {{by far the}} greatest distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs. Most comets at this distance are extremely faint, and show no discernible activity, but Hale–Bopp already had an observable coma. An image taken at the Anglo-Australian Telescope in 1993 was found to show the then-unnoticed comet some 13AU from the Sun, a distance at which most comets are essentially unobservable. (Halley's Comet was more than 100 times fainter at the same distance from the Sun.)
