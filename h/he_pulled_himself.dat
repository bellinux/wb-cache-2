5|$|On December 27, 1977, {{just two}} weeks after the incident, Washington was traded to the Boston Celtics. Red Auerbach, Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a {{longtime}} fan of Washington's. Pat stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel. While he waited for his reinstatement, which he thought would not occur until the next season, he became depressed and fell out of shape. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> together, and began {{running up and down the}} flights of stairs of the 29-story hotel.|$|E
25|$|Hooper first {{announced}} his shocking retirement {{three weeks before}} the 1999 Cricket World Cup but made a surprising comeback in 2001 and captained the West Indies team in 2003 Cricket World Cup. West Indies failed to progress to the second round after some miserable performances {{in the first round of}} tournament. Despite that, Hooper was retained in the side but this time, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> back and finally retired from the game as he wanted a youngster in the team instead of him.|$|E
25|$|On 20 October 1897, {{an attempt}} by a British force to take the {{strongly}} held Dargai Heights was beaten back, leaving three battalions pinned down under heavy fire from above and unable to withdraw. They were reinforced by the 1st Gordons, who were ordered to advance through the open ground and storm the heights, led by their five pipers. Findlater was wounded before reaching the hillside, with a superficial wound to his left foot and a broken right ankle. Unable to walk, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> to a boulder, propped himself up, and continued to play to encourage the advance. The infantry following behind successfully reached the hillside, climbed the heights, and dispersed the defenders.|$|E
60|$|When he {{is three}} {{inches off the}} bridge, <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>himself</b> up straight, and the brickwork, as the train dashes through, kills a fly that was {{trespassing}} on {{the upper part of}} his right ear.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Truck Who Cried Tow"- Meteor {{tries to}} call Little Tow to help him, but <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>himself</b> out. Little Tow tricks the others {{thinking}} he is stuck. Ironically, during a race, Little Tow {{has to be}} {{pulled out of the}} mud.|$|R

500|$|Aronofsky had {{the idea}} for The Wrestler for over a decade. He hired Robert D. Siegal to turn his idea into a script. The actor Nicolas Cage entered {{negotiations}} in October 2007 to star as Randy, the film's protagonist. The following month Cage left the project, and Mickey Rourke replaced him in the lead role. Aronofsky said that Cage {{pulled out of the}} movie because Aronofsky wanted Rourke to star; Aronofsky said, stating that Cage was [...] "a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and I think it really could have worked with Nic but, you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> out of the race." [...] Cage responded, [...] "I wasn't quote 'dropped' from the movie. I resigned from the movie because I didn't think I had enough time to achieve the look of the wrestler who was on steroids, which I would never do". The roughly 40-day shoot began in January 2008.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Verschoyle Phillip Cronyn later {{described}} his harrowing return flight. Being the rare targeted pilot to escape Voss's gun fire, he {{now had to}} coax home a failing machine destined for the scrapheap. He lost control of it banking for the landing pattern, and finally performed a desperate high speed landing at 18:40 hours, approximately coincidental with the triplane's impact. The 56 Squadron commander, Major Blomfield, led the shaky-kneed pilot from his machine to a bench and plied him with medicinal brandy. Cronyn's composure broke. After a fit of weeping, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> together as McCudden landed, followed by Rhys-Davids. The latter exited his machine hyperventilating and stammering. He got his tot of brandy, and uttered an account jumbled by his excitement. With the exception of Muspratt, who had landed at the 1 Squadron aerodrome with a seized engine, the rest of 56 Squadron landed back at Estr√©e-Blanche. Combat reports by the pilots were written and submitted; those from McCudden, Rhys-Davids, Bowman, Maybery, Hoidge, and Gardiner still exist. These fragmentary written documents would be supplemented by McCudden's autobiography, written before his death the following year; contradictory written accounts produced by Chidlaw-Roberts and Bowman in 1942; and Cronyn's memoirs of 1976. When corresponding with aviation historian Evan Hadingham in 1967, Cronyn offered, [...] "...movements were purely instinctive, and made on such split second action that no impression was recorded." [...] He offered as example that he was unaware he {{had spent most of}} his fight with Voss flying inverted until Muspratt mentioned it in the mess the evening of the fight.|$|E
2500|$|The Wrestler {{was written}} by Robert D. Siegel, a former writer for The Onion, and entered {{development}} at director Darren Aronofsky's Protozoa Pictures. Nicolas Cage entered negotiations in October 2007 to star as Randy. The following month Cage left the project, and Mickey Rourke replaced him in the lead role. According to Aronofsky, Cage {{pulled out of the}} movie because Aronofsky wanted Rourke as the lead character.

60|$|NAPOLEON. Of course. (Suddenly recollecting <b>himself.)</b> Stop: no. (<b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>himself</b> piously together, and says, {{like a man}} {{conducting}} a religious service) I am only the servant of the French republic, following humbly {{in the footsteps of}} the heroes of classical antiquity. I win battles for humanity--for my country, not for myself.|$|R
5000|$|... "For the {{scientist}} {{who has lived}} by his faith {{in the power of}} reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountain of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>himself</b> over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries." ...|$|R
6000|$|LARRY. Yes: {{one does}} stick frightfully {{in the same}} place, unless some {{external}} force comes and routs one out.

And how have you been all this time? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have noticed}} several times," [...] Scudamore said, [...] "that Easton's play depends {{very much on}} the state of the game: if we are getting the best of it he seems to think that there is no {{occasion}} to exert himself, but if the game is going against us <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>himself</b> together and goes into it with all his might." ...|$|R

2500|$|Venus and Adonis is a {{narrative}} poem by William Shakespeare {{that was published}} in 1593 and is probably Shakespeare's first publication. [...] As noted by Erwin Panofsky, the poem certainly has similarities with Titian's painting, general ones in that Venus has difficulty attracting the very young Adonis, and in specific details. [...] On his last morning she tries to physically restrain him from going hunting, but <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>himself</b> away, as in the Titian.|$|R

6000|$|... "Miss Thorne," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>himself</b> {{up at the}} gate, [...] "if I {{had known}} that I was to be so {{extremely}} happy as to have found you here, I would have brought you down the most beautiful creature, an Arab.
