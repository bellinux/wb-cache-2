25|$|Nechtan's ecclesiastical {{reforms are}} seen as having led to closer links between Pictland and Northumbria, with notable results in artistic forms. His {{expulsion}} of Ionan clerics, rather than being a submission to Rome and Northumbria, probably marks the coming of age of an independent Pictish church, which nonetheless remained close to Iona and to Ireland.

25|$|On January 6, 1773, black petitioners {{submitted}} {{the first of}} five appeals written during the year, asking {{for a range of}} rights, to Governor Hutchinson and the General Court of Massachusetts. Though signed only by a slave named Felix, the document petitioned for the freedom and rights of all slaves in the Massachusetts colony. While the tone of the petition is cautious, <b>it</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> the “unhappy State and Condition” in which enslaved persons are forced to live. Abolitionists later published the petition as a pamphlet, along with letters and other abolitionist documents. Felix’s petition expressed the talk of freedom, liberty, {{and the pursuit of happiness}} that was circulating around Massachusetts and other American colonies before the American Revolution. No record of a response from the Massachusetts General Court exists. Although slavery was never explicitly abolished or prohibited in the new Massachusetts Constitution after the Revolutionary War, rulings in freedom suits by Mum Bett and Quock Walker established that its representation of rights was incompatible with slavery, and remaining slaves effectively gained their freedom.|$|E

In {{regard to the}} first season, New York Daily News named Grey's Anatomy a [...] "winner", whereas Newsday expressed a positive opinion by stating [...] "You simply can't stop watching." [...] Walter Chaw from Film Freak Central said the show was [...] "so odious, so repugnant, that it's impossible not to have predicted its newly-minted role as the most popular program in the land." [...] The Washington Posts Tom Shales was critical of the early series, finding it reminiscent of ER and commenting that: [...] "The show is much {{more a matter of}} commercial calculation than an honest attempt to try something fresh and different". He called Rhimes' script for the pilot episode [...] "nothing but a casserole made of equal parts ham and corn", writing that overall: [...] "It's a 'new' show only in the sense that Dr. Frankenstein's monster was a new man." [...] Kate Aurthur for The New York Times deemed the show a hybrid of Ally McBeal, Sex and the City and ER, writing of the news that it had become the highest-rated midseason drama in 12 years that: [...] "When you parse its ratings, Grey's Anatomy underscores one of the real lessons of the current season - men will watch shows with a female lead. That goes against conventional wisdom, which dictates that it's easier to get women to watch shows aimed at men." [...] Review Stream gave positive reviews regarding the pilot episode, [...] "A Hard Day's Night", due to the undeniable chemistry between Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey from the series' first scene. Regarding Miranda Bailey's appearance in the pilot, ReviewStream.com stated [...] "She's such a small woman but wait until she speaks". HomeTheaterInfo.com, however, had a mixed perspectives on the pilot, noting that the storylines were similar to fellow ABC series Desperate Housewives, but also [...] "brilliantly written, extremely well acted and directed to near perfection". IGN gave a positive review stating, [...] "The show isn't derivative, and actually maintains a tenuous edge over its predecessor, the characters resemble real people - who are fragile, and yes, fallible." [...] and added, [...] "this facile description does little justice to the show's tightly-wound plotting, character subtleties, or masterful acting, <b>it</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> the intangible nature of what differentiates the wheat from the chaff, so to speak, in network television." ...|$|E

[...] He had been [...] "ordered [...] to work from home pending an investigation." [...] Sandals called it a [...] "one off." [...] Sandals stated how this type of material would not be included in the new Ontario curriculum. Lisa MacLeod, the critic for education from the Progressive Conservative Party, stated [...] "parents have not asked for this type of sexually explicit information to be made available to their children.

[...] A spokesman for the school board claimed that the teacher had [...] "good intentions." [...] MacLeod criticized the spokesman and thinks that the school board should fire someone for the material being posted. The AIDS Committee of Toronto, who published one of the brochures, stated that the intended material published by them was for adults. The Toronto Sun asked in an article, [...] "if the teacher now being paid to be at home, or any adult, were to pass out this material in a park, would the police not be called?" [...] and when is the TDSB going to notify police about a brochure teaching children?"safer sucking tips?" [...] A spokesman for the board stated, [...] "At this time, police have not been notified." [...] Toronto Police Service investigated the brochures and decided that no charges would be pressed against Vroom because it [...] "didn't meet Criminal Code criteria to lay charges for exposing children to obscene material or corrupting the morals of children."
