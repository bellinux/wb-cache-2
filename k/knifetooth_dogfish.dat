5000|$|The <b>knifetooth</b> <b>dogfish,</b> is a {{harmless}} sleeper shark {{of the family}} Somniosidae, found in the eastern Atlantic, from Scotland to Spain, Portugal, and Senegal, and the southwest Pacific from New Zealand, between latitudes 58째N and 15째N, at depths of between 200 and 1,600 m. Its length is up to 1.1 m.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results on nine {{of the most important}} elasmobranch fish species of the nine years (2001 - 2009) of the Porcupine bank Spanish surveys. The main species in biomass terms in Porcupine bank bottom trawl survey, in decreasing biomass abundance order, are: blackmouth catshark, birdbeak dogfish, velvet belly, <b>Knifetooth</b> <b>dogfish,</b> lesser spotted dogfish, bluntnose sixgill shark, sandy ray, cuckoo ray and common skate. Many of these species occupy mainly the deep areas covered in the survey, especially birdbeak dogfish, <b>knifetooth</b> <b>dogfish</b> and velvet belly. Less confined to deeper grounds are blackmouth catshark and sandy ray, while lesser spotted dogfish and cuckoo ray inhabit mainly the shallower grounds close to the Irish shelf or the central mound in the bank. Length distributions of these species along the survey series are also presented and discussed. The few available data on siki sharks from the Porcupine bank survey are also summarized.

The main species in biomass terms in this survey were Galeus melastomus (blackmouth catshark), Deania calcea (birdbeak dogfish), Deania profundorum (arrowhead dogfish), Scyliorhinus canicula (lesser spotted dogfish), Scymnodon ringens (<b>Knifetooth</b> <b>dogfish),</b> Etmopterus spinax (velvet belly lantern shark), Dalatias licha (Kitefin shark) Hexanchus griseus (bluntnose sixgill shark), Leucoraja circularis (sandy ray), Leucoraja naevus (cuckoo ray), Dipturus nidarosiensis (Norwegian skate) and Dipturus spp. / Dipturus cf. flossada / Dipturus cf. intermedia (common skate). Biomass, distribution and length ranges were analysed. Many of these species occupy mainly the deep areas covered in the survey, especially D. calcea, D. profundorum and S. ringens...|$|E
40|$|This working {{document}} {{presents the results}} on nine {{of the most important}} elasmobranch species of the Porcupine bank Spanish surveys during the last decade (2001 - 2011). The shark species more abundant in these surveys in biomass terms were blackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus), birdbeak dogfish (Deania calcea), <b>Knifetooth</b> <b>dogfish</b> (Scymnodon ringens), velvet belly lantern shark (Etmopterus spinax), lesser spotted dogfish (Scyliorhinus canicula) and bluntnose sixgill shark (Hexanchus griseus); while sandy ray (Leucoraja circularis), cuckoo ray (Leucoraja naevus) and common skate (Dipturus spp. / Dipturus cf. flossada) were the more frequent Rajidae. Biomass, distribution and length ranges were analysed. Many of these species occupy mainly the deep areas covered in the survey, especially D. calcea and S. ringens. Versi처n del edito...|$|E
40|$|This working {{document}} {{presents the results}} on the most significant elasmobranch species of the Porcupine Bank Spanish surveys in 2014 and updates the documents presented in previous years with {{the information in the}} whole historical series from 2001. The main species in biomass terms in this survey were Galeus melastomus (blackmouth catshark), Deania calcea (birdbeak dogfish), Scymnodon ringens (<b>Knifetooth</b> <b>dogfish),</b> Dipturus nidarosiensis (Norwegian skate), Scyliorhinus canicula (lesser spotted dogfish), Etmopterus spinax (velvet belly lantern shark), Hexanchus griseus (bluntnose sixgill shark), Dalatias licha (Kitefin shark), Leucoraja circularis (sandy ray), Dipturus cf. flossada, Leucoraja naevus (cuckoo ray) and Dipturus cf. intermedia (common skate). Biomass, distribution and length ranges were analysed for these species. All the species analysed increased its biomass in 2014, except S. canicula and D. cf. flossada that decreased. D. calcea individuals smaller than 65 cm were captured again in 2014 after not having been captured the previous year, although catches were very low. Raja brachyura was recorded {{for the first time in}} the survey area...|$|E
