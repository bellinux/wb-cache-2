5|$|After the High Councillor's {{downfall}} and the regime's {{defeat in}} Metropolis, the Regime is dismantled {{and all of}} its accomplices are arrested. Harley Quinn has the Joker sent back to the prime universe after realizing that he does not care about her, Green Lantern hands over his counterpart and Sinestro to the Guardians of the Universe to stand trial, and Wonder Woman dethrones her counterpart. The dictator Superman is placed in a prison emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless, and his prime counterpart admits that if he were placed in the same position, he might have done the same thing. The alternate Batman tells Superman that he hopes that Superman never has to learn what he could be capable of if he turns evil, and warns him that if something <b>ever</b> <b>happens</b> to him, causing him to go down the path of his counterpart, he will come after him. As they walk away, the alternate Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his powers.|$|E
500|$|In the NME, Bob Woffinden denigrated [...] "Simply Shady" [...] as [...] " [...] all the faults that clog the album". Woffinden continued: [...] "George's vocals are tiresome, his voice, nasal and toneless, {{seems to}} be slowing down the song; the lyrics are {{straightforward}} and dull. Also the familiar cloying punches that Harrison's own production pulls are evident. Nothing <b>ever</b> <b>happens</b> – the sound is dense, viscid..." [...] In an otherwise favourable review, Brian Harrigan of Melody Maker praised the musicianship of Harrison and the L.A. Express, and Harrison's singing on the album, but said that the song [...] "really drags on".|$|E

As Milo drives on, he daydreams and soon is paying no attention at all, and gets lost in the Doldrums, a colorless place where nothing <b>ever</b> <b>happens.</b> Milo is soon joining the inhabitants, the Lethargarians, in killing time there, a pastime angrily interrupted {{by the arrival of}} Tock, a talking oversize dog with an alarm clock on each side (a [...] "watchdog"), who tells Milo that only by thinking can he get out of the Doldrums. Head abuzz with unaccustomed thoughts, Milo is soon back on his road, and the watchdog joins him on his journey through Wisdom.|$|E

50|$|What <b>Ever</b> <b>Happened</b> to Baby Toto? (Che fine ha fatto Totò Baby?) is a 1964 Italian black comedy film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Ottavio Alessi. It is a parody of Robert Aldrich's What <b>Ever</b> <b>Happened</b> to Baby Jane?.|$|R
500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} season, the writers had the idea one of the {{background}} survivors would emerge and receive an on-island flashback episode to help answer the question, [...] "What the hell is going on with the other 35 people who nothing <b>ever</b> <b>happens</b> to?" [...] The first of those was Leslie Arzt, only for him to explode a few episodes later. It was originally conceived only a woman, who was previously an actress, would be introduced into the main storyline, but the idea later changed to include her boyfriend as well. Nikki and Paulo were also originally set [...] "to have anchored a winking arc of stories". However the writers instead decided to tell their story in one episode and quickly remove the characters, due to complaints about the characters and the third season's decline in viewership. It also became a running gag that Sawyer did not know who Nikki and Paulo were, calling them [...] "Nina" [...] and [...] "Pablo" [...] and asking [...] "who the hell [...] ". Lindelof later stated, [...] "We had the feeling with Nikki and Paulo that it wasn't right about a month before the fans started reacting. We were already starting to think, 'Maybe our instinct here has been wrong.|$|E

50|$|The genre {{began in}} 1962 with What <b>Ever</b> <b>Happened</b> to Baby Jane? {{directed}} by Robert Aldrich. What <b>Ever</b> <b>Happened</b> to Baby Jane? bolstered the flagging careers of its stars, Bette Davis as Baby Jane Hudson and Joan Crawford as Blanche Hudson. The 1950 Billy Wilder classic Sunset Boulevard shares thematic similarities (their respective central characters both psychotically deranged formerly-glamorous older women) with What <b>Ever</b> <b>Happened</b> to Baby Jane? {{and can be}} seen as a precursor to the genre.|$|R
5000|$|... "You're the Best Thing That <b>Ever</b> <b>Happened</b> To Me" [...] — {{also known}} simply as [...] "Best Thing That <b>Ever</b> <b>Happened</b> To Me" [...] — is a song written by Jim Weatherly, and enjoyed two runs of popularity, each by an artist in a {{different}} genre.|$|R
2500|$|Jackie Ormes {{was born}} Zelda Mavin Jackson on August 1, 1911 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to parents William Winfield Jackson and Mary Brown Jackson. Her father William, {{the owner of}} a {{printing}} company and movie theater proprietor, was killed in an automobile accident in 1917. This resulted in the then six-year old Jackie and her younger sister Dolores in the care of their aunt and uncle for a brief period of time. Eventually, Jackie's mother remarried and the family relocated to the nearby suburb of Monongahela. Ormes described the suburb in a 1985 interview for the Chicago Reader as [...] "spread out and simple. Nothing momentous <b>ever</b> <b>happens</b> here". She {{graduated from high school in}} Monongahela in 1930.|$|E
2500|$|Aside from Caragiale, the {{journalist}} Geo Bogza, writing after the town's economic decline had begun, helped impress {{on the public}} Mizil's image {{as a place where}} nothing important <b>ever</b> <b>happens,</b> in a 1938 reportage titled 175 de minute la Mizil ("175 Minutes in Mizil") and summarised as [...] "the adventure of the banal". Other literary portrayals have been undertaken by local writers, including the poets Mihai Negulescu and Petre Strihan; {{the journalist}} and poet George Ranetti (Romeo și Julieta la Mizil, [...] "Romeo and Juliet in Mizil"); Joachim Botez (Însemnările unui Belfer, [...] "Notes of an Idle Rich Man"; Minerva la Mizil, [...] "Minerva at Mizil"; De la Piatra la Mizil, [...] "From Piatra to Mizil"; Împușcat la Mizil, [...] "Gunned Down in Mizil"); and the novels of Cosmin Manolache since 2000, including Ce față cumplită am ("What a Cruel Face I Have").|$|E
2500|$|In a 1993 {{interview}} with Miller, Option wrote that success was a touchy subject for him, quoting Miller's joking {{example of a}} typical review: [...] "Nothing good <b>ever</b> <b>happens</b> to Scott Miller, but somehow he's managed to drag his broken body into a studio {{one more time and}} make another album." [...] Miller continued that he was [...] "past the point of fighting" [...] discussions of how [...] "arty or brainy" [...] he was, but had hoped for greater emphasis [...] "on what the songs are about—be it the boy-girl situation, or being depressed about some key failure I've had, or getting a little bit of understanding about life." [...] In another 1993 interview, Miller mused:I don't think I'm in danger of making albums that don't age well, because I haven't ever fit into the times spectacularly well. I've always been aware of myself drawing on a musical vocabulary so broad {{that a lot of people}} don't get what I consider to be my real songwriting coups. I think they go right past a lot of people. The bad part of that is I probably won't become a big star. But the good part is that I don't think people will find the albums less useful over time. They'll sound as good in 2004 as they will in 1994.|$|E
