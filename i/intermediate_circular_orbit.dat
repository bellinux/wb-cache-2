30|$|A Hohmann {{transfer}} is a transition between two coplanar <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> of different altitudes, first described by Walter Hohmann in 1925 [16].

5000|$|The second {{application}} of space militarisation currently in use is GPS or Global Positioning System. This satellite navigation system {{is used for}} determining one's precise location and providing a highly accurate time reference almost anywhere on Earth or in Earth orbit. It uses an <b>intermediate</b> <b>circular</b> <b>orbit</b> (ICO) satellite constellation of at least 24 satellites. The GPS system was designed by and {{is controlled by the}} United States Department of Defense and can be used by anyone, free of charge. The cost of maintaining the system is approximately US$400 million per year, including the replacement of ageing satellites. The first of 24 satellites that form the current GPS constellation (Block II) was placed into orbit on February 14, 1989. The 52nd GPS satellite since the beginning in 1978 was launched November 6, 2004 aboard a Delta II rocket.The primary military purposes are to allow improved command and control of forces through improved location awareness, and to facilitate accurate targeting of smart bombs, cruise missiles, or other munitions. The satellites also carry nuclear detonation detectors, which form a major portion of the United States Nuclear Detonation Detection System. European concern about the level of control over the GPS network and commercial issues has resulted in the planned Galileo positioning system. Russia already operates an independent system called GLONASS (global navigation system), the system operates with 24 satellites that are deployed in 3 orbital planes as opposed to the 4 GPS is deployed in.The Chinese [...] "Beidou" [...] system provides China a similar regional (not global) navigation capability.

40|$|We study {{motion of}} charged {{particles}} {{in the field of}} a rotating black hole immersed into an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field, focusing on the epicyclic quasi-circular orbits near the equatorial plane. Separating the <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> into four qualitatively different classes according to the sign of the canonical angular momentum of the motion and the orientation of the Lorentz force, we analyse the <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> using the so called force formalism. We find the analytical solutions for the radial profiles of velocity, specific angular momentum and specific energy of the <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> in dependence on the black hole dimensionless spin and the magnetic field strength. The innermost stable <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> are determined for all four classes of the <b>circular</b> <b>orbits.</b> The stable <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> with outward oriented Lorentz force can extend to radii lower than the radius of the corresponding photon circular geodesic. We calculate the frequencies of the harmonic oscillatory motion of the charged {{particles in the}} radial and vertical directions related to the equatorial <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> and study the radial profiles of the radial, ω_, vertical, ω_, and orbital, ω_, frequencies, finding significant differences in comparison to the epicyclic geodesic circular motion. The most important new phenomenon is existence of toroidal charged particle epicyclic motion with ω_∼ω_ >> ω_ that could occur around retrograde <b>circular</b> <b>orbits</b> with outward oriented Lorentz force. We demonstrate that for the rapidly rotating black holes the role of the 'Wald induced charge' can be relevant. Comment: 19 pages, 11 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
