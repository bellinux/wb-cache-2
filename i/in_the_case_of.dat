5|$|An {{important}} aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained {{over a number of}} consecutive days.|$|E

40|$|Aim: {{to define}} {{clinical}} and etiological, radiation and neurophysiological parameters determining {{the transformation of}} disseminated leukoencephalitis to multiple sclerosis in children. Materials and methods: clinical and etiological analysis of leukoencephalitis in 229 children aged 1 - 17 years old and their catamnesis for 5, 5 ± 1, 8 years were performed. Morphostructural characteristic was made by brain and spinal cord MRI and multimodal provoked potentials. Results: The development of multiple sclerosis in children was observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outcome of leukoencephalitis chronic course in 44, 4 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> and <b>in</b> 73, 3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> mixed herpes viral infection (Epstein-Barr virus and 6 type herpes virus). Morphostructural features <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> leukoencephalitis <b>in</b> children depending on the disease course characterized by the prevalence of edematous and inflammatory character <b>of</b> CNS changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> an acute course, by demyelinating changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> a prolonged course, and by degenerative and demyelinating ones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> a chronic course were determined. Administration of etiopathogenetic therapy for leukoencephalitis allows to achieve either a complete recovery or with the deficiency up to 2, 5 points by EDSS in 96, 6 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> acute and prolonged course, and clinical and radiation remission in 50, 1 % and recovery in 5, 5 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> chronic course...|$|R
