Vehicles that use an oxygen sensor or other feedback loop to control fuel to air ratio (lambda control), compensate automatically for this change in the fuel's stoichiometric rate by measuring the exhaust gas composition and controlling fuel volume. Vehicles without such controls (such as most motorcycles until recently, and cars predating the mid-1980s) may have difficulties running certain fuel blends (especially winter fuels used in some areas) and may require different jets (or otherwise have the fueling ratios altered) to compensate.

For this purpose, the CMC model is applied to two sets of direct numerical simulations (DNSs) modelling ignition of lean n-heptane/air and iso-octane/air mixtures with various levels of thermal stratification. The results show excellent agreement for all n-heptane cases with thermal stratification of 15 - 60 K. However, an advanced ignition is predicted by the CMC model for the <b>iso-octane</b> case with thermal stratification of 60 K {{in comparison with the}} DNS data. Inspection of homogeneous ignition delay demonstrates that the ignition delay time fluctuations are much higher in the <b>iso-octane</b> cases compared with the n-heptane cases having same level of temperature inhomogeneities. This is because of the differing ignition responses to temperature between these two fuels. The observed discrepancies in the <b>iso-octane</b> case with (Formula presented.)
