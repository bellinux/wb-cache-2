Additionally, although cancerogenic properties of <b>erionite</b> {{have been discovered}} by investigating the <b>erionite</b> found in Central Anatolia, Turkey, no difference in their carcinogenic capacity has been observed when it was compared to the <b>erionite</b> obtained in North Dakota, USA.|$|E
5000|$|Deposits of fibrous <b>erionite</b> {{are located}} in Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah. These zeolite beds may be up to [...] thick and may lie in surface outcroppings. <b>Erionite</b> fibers have been {{detected}} in samples of road dust in Nevada and U.S. residents of the Intermountain West may be potentially exposed to fibrous <b>erionite</b> in ambient air. In the summer of 2009 North Dakota began a study of possible <b>erionite</b> exposure among residents. <b>Erionite</b> has also been identified in samples from the Tertiary Arikaree Formation in southeast Montana and northwest South Dakota.|$|E
50|$|<b>Erionite</b> is a {{naturally}} occurring fibrous mineral {{that belongs to}} a group of minerals called zeolites. It usually is found in volcanic ash that has been altered by weathering and ground water. <b>Erionite</b> forms brittle, wool-like fibrous masses in the hollows of rock formations and has an internal molecular structure similar to chabazite. Some properties of <b>erionite</b> are similar to the properties of asbestos; however, <b>erionite</b> is not currently regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as one of the six asbestos fibers. <b>Erionite</b> was first described by A.S. Eakle in 1898, as white woolly fibrous masses in cavities in rhyolite lava near Durkee, Oregon. It was originally thought to be another relatively rare zeolite named offretite, which is very similar to <b>erionite</b> in appearance and chemical composition.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Erionite</b> is {{a zeolite}} mineral with similar {{properties}} to asbestos {{and is known}} to cause mesothelioma. Detailed epidemiological investigation has shown that <b>erionite</b> causes mesothelioma mostly in families with a genetic predisposition. <b>Erionite</b> is found in deposits in the Western United States, where it is used in gravel for road surfacing, and in Turkey, where {{it is used to}} construct homes. In Turkey, the United States, and Mexico, <b>erionite</b> has been associated with mesothelioma and has thus been designated a [...] "known human carcinogen" [...] by the US National Toxicology Program.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Erionite</b> {{is known}} to be a human {{carcinogen}} and is listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a Group 1 Carcinogen. The prevalence of malignant pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma due to <b>erionite</b> exposure in the Central Anatolia Region is very high. [...] Descriptive studies have reported an excess of mortality from mesothelioma in individuals living in three Turkish villages where there was chronic exposure to erionite; only two cases of mesothelioma occurred in the control village, both in women born elsewhere. An excess of lung cancer also was reported in two of the three villages contaminated with <b>erionite.</b> Respirable <b>erionite</b> fibers were detected in air samples collected from the affected villages, and lung tissue samples collected from mesothelioma cases contained <b>erionite</b> fibers. A higher proportion of ferruginous bodies with a zeolite core were found in inhabitants of the contaminated villages than of those from the two control villages. <b>Erionite</b> is reportedly present in the local volcanic tuff.|$|E
50|$|In the past, {{occupational}} exposure occurred from <b>erionite</b> mining and production operation. Nowadays potential {{occupational exposure}} to <b>erionite</b> usually occurs during {{the production and}} mining of other zeolites. <b>Erionite</b> was also reported to be a minor component in some commercial zeolites. Therefore, the use of other zeolites may result in potential exposure to <b>erionite</b> for the workers and the general population who use the zeolites {{in a variety of}} processes and products. Total dust exposures for miners in an open-pit zeolite mine that contained some <b>erionite</b> in Arizona ranged from 0.01 to 13.7 mg/m3; respirable dust in the mining area was 0.01 to 1.4 mg/m3.Erionite is held responsible for the high incidence of lung cancer, asbestosis, pleural mesothelioma and other lung problems in the Turkish village of Tuzkoy near Nevsehir in the popular tourist region of Cappadoccia.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} composition of <b>erionite</b> is approximately {{represented by the}} formula (Na2,K2,Ca)2Al4Si14O36·15H2O. It can be differentiated into Erionite-Na, Erionite-K, and Erionite-Ca forms based on the most dominant component. <b>Erionite</b> has a hexagonal, cage-like structure composed of a framework of linked tetrahedra. It consists of white prismatic crystals in radiating groups of crystal fiber. <b>Erionite</b> absorbs up to 20% of its weight in water, has a specific gravity of 2.02 to 2.13, and has gas absorption, ion exchange, and catalytic properties that are highly selective and depend on the molecular size of the absorbed compounds. Zeolites, in general, have good thermal stability, rehydration kinetics, and water vapor adsorption capacity.|$|E
50|$|A 1975 {{study of}} three small villages in central Cappadocia, Turkey—Tuzköy, Karain and Sarıhıdır—found that peritoneal {{mesothelioma}} was causing 50% of all deaths. Initially, this {{was attributed to}} <b>erionite,</b> a zeolite mineral with similar properties to asbestos, but detailed epidemiological investigation demonstrated that the substance causes the disease mostly in families with a genetic predisposition to mineral fiber carcinogenesis.

5000|$|SSZ-13 (framework {{type code}} CHA) is an {{aluminosilicate}} zeolite mineral possessing 0.38 × 0.38 nm micropores. It {{belongs to the}} ABC-6 family of zeolites as well as offretite, cancrinite, <b>erionite</b> and other related minerals. The framework topology {{is the same as}} that of chabazite but SSZ-13 has high-silica composition with Si/Al > 5 which leads to low cation exchange capacity. The typical chemical formula of the unit cell can be described as QxNayAl2.4Si33.6O72•zH2O (1.4 < x <27)(0.7 < y < 4.3)(1 < z <7), where Q is N,N,N-1-trimethyladamantammonium. [...] The material was patented by Chevron research Company in 1985, and has a potential use as a solid catalyst for the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process and the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx.|$|E
5000|$|The {{incidence}} of mesothelioma {{has been found}} to be higher in populations living near naturally occurring asbestos. People can be exposed to naturally occurring asbestos in areas where mining or road construction is occurring, or when the asbestos-containing rock is naturally weathered. Another common route of exposure is through asbestos-containing soil, which is used to whitewash, plaster, and roof houses in Greece. In central Cappadocia, Turkey, mesothelioma was causing 50% of all deaths in three small villages—Tuzköy, Karain, and Sarıhıdır. Initially, this was attributed to <b>erionite.</b> Environmental exposure to asbestos has caused mesothelioma in places other than Turkey, including Corsica, Greece, Cyprus, China, and California. In the northern Greek mountain town of Metsovo, this exposure had resulted in mesothelioma incidence around 300 times more than expected in asbestos-free populations, and was associated with very frequent pleural calcification known as [...] "Metsovo Lung".|$|E
50|$|The {{possibility}} of this exposure being occupational seemed very unlikely, {{as there are}} no asbestos mines or factories near Metsovo. The nearest such mine (active until 1990) is located near Kozani, a city 150 miles east of Metsovo. Guided by previous research by Izzetin Baris dealing with not-occupational (domestic) exposure of vast areas in Anatolia (Turkey) from <b>erionite</b> and tremolite, the researchers arranged a meeting with Metsovites where {{they were told that}} practically all households in Metsovo were using soil from nearby hills (white soil = louto in the local dialect) for whitewashing. The material was applied more often on walls around fireplaces, because this kept the walls white, unsoiled from the fire. This whitewash was used by everybody until 1940-1950 and gradually abandoned, so that in 1980 it was used by only 15% of the households and by 1985 it was completely abandoned.|$|E
5000|$|Working with {{asbestos}} is {{the most}} common risk factor for mesothelioma. In the United States, asbestos is considered the major cause of malignant mesothelioma and has been considered [...] "indisputably" [...] associated with the development of mesothelioma. Indeed, the relationship between asbestos and mesothelioma is so strong that many consider mesothelioma a “signal” or “sentinel” tumor. A history of asbestos exposure exists in most cases. However, mesothelioma has been reported in some individuals without any known exposure to asbestos. In rare cases, mesothelioma has also been associated with irradiation of the chest or abdomen, intrapleural thorium dioxide (thorotrast) as a contrast medium, and inhalation of other fibrous silicates, such as <b>erionite</b> or talc. Some studies suggest that simian virus 40 (SV40) may act as a cofactor in the development of mesothelioma. This has been confirmed in animal studies, but studies in humans are inconclusive. Pericardial mesothelioma may not be associated with asbestos exposure.|$|E
40|$|Zeolites are an {{economical}} mineral used {{in several}} applications, primarily as molecular sieves {{because of their}} crystalline structure. Southwestern North Dakota has several localities of volcanic ash deposits (tuffs) that have undergone physical and chemical changes forming some zeolites in the process. Of particular interest is the zeolite mineral <b>erionite,</b> but not because of its economic potential. <b>Erionite</b> is highly carcinogenic and {{was found to be}} responsible for extremely high mortality rates in two Turkish villages in close proximity to <b>erionite</b> rock and dust. <b>Erionite</b> has traditionally been identified using x-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. The presence of swelling clays can interfere with the identification of <b>erionite</b> by XRD giving false positive results. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to identify the distinctive needlelike form of <b>erionite.</b> In some cases, <b>erionite</b> was identified using SEM techniques where <b>erionite</b> was present, but in quantities that are lower than the lower detection limits. Conversely, <b>erionite</b> was identified by XRD in some instances where the <b>erionite</b> was somewhat masked in a clay matrix. Both XRD and SEM methods should be used to properly identify <b>erionite.</b> <b>Erionite</b> was identified in sandstones and siltstones from buttes in Dunn, Stark, and Slope Counties of North Dakota, but no definitive correlation was noted between these occurrences and health effects that may be attributed to <b>erionite...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Erionite</b> is a fibrous mineral of the zeolite group mainly {{occurring}} as {{hydrothermal alteration}} product. The exposure of humans to <b>erionite</b> fibres has been unambiguously linked to malignant mesothelioma cases (Baris et al., 1978), and in vivo {{studies have demonstrated}} that <b>erionite</b> is significantly more tumorigenic than asbestos (Coffin et al., 1992). Recently, a growing concern has developed regarding the potential risks for environmental and occupational exposures to <b>erionite</b> in Turkey (Carbone et al., 2011), in the United States (Saini-Eidukat & Triplett, 2014), in Mexico (Ortega-Guerrero & Carrasco-Nùñez, 2014) and possibly in Iran (Ilgren et al., 2015). Newly researches on the identification of segregation of Fe(II) provide very important information for the understanding of the molecular mechanism/s inducing its strong carcinogenicity (Ballirano et al., 2015). Notwithstanding this, the relationships among mineralogical features and biological activity of <b>erionite</b> have not yet been fully understood and there are no systematic studies on the distribution of <b>erionite</b> or other similar fibrous zeolites in the environment. In Italy, <b>erionite</b> was reported in Sardinia and Veneto (Passaglia & Galli, 1974; Mattioli et al., 2016). Nevertheless, a systematic mapping of its distribution, the quantification of its presence in rocks and data about airborne fibers are still missing. Here we present mineralogical data of new <b>erionite</b> occurrences from Northern Italy, with a state of the art on the occurrence of <b>erionite</b> in Italy and some other potentially erionitebearing deposits. The studied <b>erionite</b> samples show prismatic to extremely fibrous habits and a variable tendency to break down in thin fibrils, which could be potentially pathogenic on inhalation. The chemical data acquired revealed variable amounts of Ca, Na, K and Mg as extra-framework cations, with small amounts of Fe. In Italy the knowledge of the epidemiology of mesothelioma linked to <b>erionite</b> is extremely scarce, and domestic cases from exposure to airborne <b>erionite</b> fibers are still to be inferred. Identifying the areas in Italy where <b>erionite</b> occurs naturally is a starting point for further specific studies on epidemiology, public health and natural hazards. An effective risk assessment in Italy will require coordinated actions from government agencies, local health authorities, Universities and research centers, in order to record the actual presence of fibrous zeolites, recognizing mineral species and quantifying their abundance in rock deposits...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The high {{incidence}} of malignant mesothelioma in some villages of Cappadocia (Turkey) is due to environmental exposure to <b>erionite</b> fibres. The aim was to evaluate the fibre burden in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from inhabitants of an <b>erionite</b> village and compare it with Turkish subjects with or without environmental exposure to tremolite asbestos. METHODS: Ferruginous bodies (FBs) and fibres were measured and analyzed by light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in the BALF of 16 subjects originating from Tuzköy. RESULTS: FBs were detected in the BALF of 12 subjects, with concentrations above 1 FB/ml in seven of them. <b>Erionite</b> was the central fibre of 95. 7 % of FBs. <b>Erionite</b> fibres {{were found in the}} BALF of all subjects, by TEM, and these fibres were low in Mg, K, and Ca compared with <b>erionite</b> from Tuzköy soil. The mean concentration of <b>erionite</b> fibres in BALF was similar to that of tremolite fibres in Turks with environmental exposure to tremolite. The proportion of fibres longer than 8 microm in BALF represented 35. 6 % for <b>erionite</b> compared with 14. 0 % for tremolite. The asbestos fibre concentrations in <b>erionite</b> villagers was not different from that in Turks without environmental exposure to tremolite. CONCLUSION: Analysis of BALF gives information about fibre retention in populations environmentally exposed to <b>erionite</b> for whom data on fibre burden from lung tissue samples are scarce. This may apply to exposed Turks having emigrated to other countries. Comparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The naturally-occurring zeolite mineral <b>erionite</b> has a fibrous {{morphology}} {{and is a}} known {{human carcinogen}} (inhalation hazard). <b>Erionite</b> has been found typically in very small quantities and restricted occurrences {{in the course of}} mineralogic characterization of Yucca Mountain as a host for a high-level nuclear waste repository. The first identification of <b>erionite</b> was made in 1984 on the basis of morphology and chemical composition and later confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. It was found in the lower vitrophyre (Tptpv 3) of the Topopah Spring Tuff in a borehole sidewall sample. Most <b>erionite</b> occurrences identified at Yucca Mountain are in the Topopah Spring Tuff, within an irregular zone of transition between the lower boundary of devitrified tuff and underlying glassy tuff. This zone is fractured and contains intermingled devitrified and vitric tuff. In 1997, a second host of <b>erionite</b> mineralization was identified in the Exploratory Studies Facility within and adjacent to a high-angle fracture/breccia zone transgressing the boundary between the lowermost devitrified tuff (Tpcplnc) and underlying moderately welded vitric tuff (Tpcpv 2) of the Tiva Canyon Tuff. The devitrified-vitric transition zones where <b>erionite</b> is found tend to have complex secondary-mineral assemblages, some of very localized occurrence. Secondary minerals in addition to <b>erionite</b> may include smectite, heulandite-clinoptilolite, chabazite, opal-A, opal-CT, cristobalite, quartz, kenyaite, and moganite. Incipient devitrification within the Topopah Spring Tuff transition zone includes patches that are highly enriched in potassium feldspar relative to the precursor volcanic glass. Geochemical conditions during glass alteration may have led to local evolution of potassium-rich fluids. Thermodynamic modeling of zeolite stability shows that <b>erionite</b> and chabazite stability fields occur only at aqueous K concentrations much higher than in present Yucca Mountain waters. The association of <b>erionite</b> with opal-A, opal-CT, and moganite suggests that <b>erionite</b> formed at a high silica activity...|$|E

40|$|We have {{conducted}} an investigation {{to determine the}} occurrence and distribution of <b>erionite,</b> a potential carcinogen, at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Using x-ray powder diffraction techniques yielding detection limits to below 0. 05 wt %, we positively identified <b>erionite</b> in only 3 out of 76 bulk and 12 fracture samples investigated. The three erionite-bearing samples (J 12 - 620 / 630, UE- 25 aNo. 1 - 1296. 2, and USW G 4 - 1314) all occur above the static water level in clay/zeolite-rich horizons {{near the top of}} vitrophyres. <b>Erionite</b> occurs as trace amounts of less than 1 wt % in the whole rock, although it may occur locally in significant amounts as fracture fillings (e. g., UE- 25 aNo. 1 - 1296. 2 where it comprises approximately 45 wt % of the fracture filling material).

40|$|Epidemiologic {{evidence}} has recently identified {{an association between}} an endemic outbreak of pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma in the Urgup region of Turkey and exposure to zeolite fibres.

The present study further defines the in vitro biologic activity of <b>erionite,</b> a common zeolite fibre found in the Urgup region of Turkey. Both <b>erionite</b> and crocidolite asbestos fibres were clastogenic in synchronous Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) fibroblasts. Both fibres also altered CHO ploidy. <b>Erionite,</b> unlike crocidolite or Min-U-Sil quartz, caused a slight increase in sister chromatid exchanges in synchronous CHO cells. Neither <b>erionite</b> nor crocidolite was mutagenic in a human lymphoblastoid cell line. <b>Erionite</b> fibres thus produced in vitro cytogenic changes similar to those caused by asbestiform mineral dusts and, like asbestos fibres, did not induce mutations in human lymphoblastoid cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} some 30 {{years ago}} that <b>erionite,</b> a fibrous zeolite mineral, induced mesotheliomas in those living in certain villages in Cappadocia engendered {{a vast amount of}} both geological/mineralogical and clinical/ epidemiological work.

40|$|Exposure {{of humans}} to <b>erionite</b> fibers of {{suitable}} morphology and dimension has been unambiguously {{linked to the}} occurrence of malignant mesothelioma. For this reason, a morphological, morphometrical, mineralogical, and chemical investigation was performed on two representative samples of potential carcinogenic, fibrous <b>erionite</b> from Lessini Mounts, northeastern (NE) Italy, which has not apparently been examined previously. The first sample is erionite-Ca with an extremely fibrous, hair-like and flexible appearance, and growth in intimate association with levyne. The second sample is erionite-Ca with prismatic to acicular crystals and rigid behavior, enriched in K+ and Ca 2 + extra-framework cations. Although <b>erionite</b> is a nominally Fe-free phase, iron (Fe) was detected in low amounts in all the analyzed crystals. In both the investigated samples, <b>erionite</b> is present as individual fibers of respirable size.

Airborne <b>erionite</b> concentrations measured in ND along roadsides, indoors, and inside vehicles, including school buses, equaled or exceeded concentrations in Boyali, where 6. 25 % of all deaths are caused by MM.

40|$|Summary Exposure to the fibrous mineral <b>erionite</b> {{is known}} to induce {{mesothelioma}} in man and laboratory animals. Previous studies demonstrated {{the presence of a}} trypsin-like protease associated with tumour cells. This protease could be demonstrated by the use of fluorescent probes which located cells possessing this enzyme. We have employed this fluorescent probe technique to follow the early events in the lungs of rats exposed to <b>erionite.</b> The evidence presented shows that the mesothelial cells initially lack this enzyme but the enzyme can be detected within hours of exposure of the rat to <b>erionite.</b> The number of mesothelial cells possessing the enzyme steadily increased after a single exposure to the mineral until the animal finally died with a massive pleural tumour. This is the first study of such fluorescent probes {{in the early stages of}} tumour induction. The fibrous mineral, <b>erionite,</b> has been linked with a high incidence of mesothelioma in the Cappodocia region of Turkey (Baris et al., 1978; Pooley, 1979). Experimental studies using fibrous <b>erionite</b> have shown it to be highly tumorigenic in rats (Wagner et al., 1985) producing virtually 100 % incidence of mesothelioma by either inhalation o...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{sought to}} assess the fibrogenic and {{carcinogenic}} potential of <b>erionite</b> (a fibrous zeolite) on the pleural mesothelium of the Fischer 344 rat (n = 24). DESIGN: The {{study was designed to}} examine rat pleural mesothelial changes by three independent observers at timed intervals, ranging from 1 to 480 days postinoculation using <b>erionite</b> from the Pine Valley, Nevada (USA) area. The mean length and width of the <b>erionite</b> fibers were 2. 29 and 0. 48 microns, respectively. Only microscopic observations made by majority (2 / 3) or unanimity (3 / 3) were accepted for final diagnosis. RESULTS: Pleural and lung tissue were available for examination in 21 of the 24 rats. Fibrosis, chronic inflammation, and foreign body reaction occurred in 6 of 21 rats. Mesothelial hyperplasia and dysplasia occurred in 9 and 3 of the 21 rats, respectively. A single mesothelioma was identified at 434 days in a rat that had gross nodular pleural lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reported herein confirm the strong fibrogenic potential of <b>erionite</b> but are at variance with previous studies reporting much higher yields of mesothelioma. The reasons for the low yield of mesothelioma in this study are not known, but {{may be related to the}} study design, the strict criteria used for histopathologic diagnosis, and/or possible differences in <b>erionite</b> physicochemical properties, associated with its geographic distribution, most previous animal studies having used <b>erionite</b> from the Rome, Oregon (USA) area...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Turkey {{have the}} rich regions related to {{asbestos}} and <b>erionite,</b> and their inhabitants have been environmentally exposed to asbestos and <b>erionite</b> since childhood. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the p 53 tumour suppressor gene and ras oncogene mutations in patients with mesothelioma relation to asbestos and <b>erionite</b> exposure. Material and Methods: The Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR) assay was employed to examine mutations in the p 53 tumour suppressor gene and K-ras & N-ras proto-oncogene in 48 paraffin block samples from 41 patients with mesothelioma and malign mesothelioma relation to asbestos and <b>erionite</b> exposure. Results: No mutations in exon 2 - 4, exon 5 - 6, exon 7 - 9, and exon 10 - 11 of the p 53 tumour suppressor gene were determined in any of the paraffin block samples with mesothelioma and malign mesothelioma. Although no mutations were found in the exon 2 (K-ras) and exon 1 (N-ras) in the paraffin block samples analysed, mutations were found in the exon 1 (K-ras) in paraffin block samples of two patients with mesothelioma (4. 88 %). Conclusion: These results indicate the p 53 tumour suppressor gene and ras proto-oncogene mutations may not play a critical role in the induction of mesothelioma by asbestos and <b>erionite</b> in humans...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Recent {{data in the}} {{biological}} literature suggest that the natural zeolite <b>erionite</b> may be more tumorigenic than asbestos minerals. Because of its potential biological importance, a technique has been developed to facilitate detection of <b>erionite</b> in tuffaceous rocks to a lower limit of detection (LLD) between 100 and 500 ppm. The method {{involves the use of}} automated X-ray powder diffraction instrumentation with long count imes, as much as 360 s/step. The presence of interfering phases, such as smectite or clinoptilolite, raises the LLD. Ethylene glycol solvation of smectite improves the LLD, and profile fitting with clinoptilolite-bearing mixtures improves quantification. Application of these methods to tufts from central Turkey allowed improved etection and more accurate quantification compared with previous scanning electron microscope xaminations. Use of these methods with tufts from Yucca Mountain, Nevada, the potential site for the nation's first high-level radioactive waste repository, showed that <b>erionite</b> occurs sporadically. <b>Erionite</b> is found only in the altered zone directly above the lower vitrophyre of the Topopah Spring Member. This altered zone is anomalous inthat is contains a variety of zeolites that are either are or absent in other Yucca Mountain tufts. It appears that <b>erionite</b> is restricted to fractures and must have formed under unusual and variable conditions in the altered zone...|$|E
40|$|The {{village of}} Karain, Turkey, has the world's highest {{prevalence}} rate of malignant mesothelioma (MM). Environmental exposure to <b>erionite</b> {{is thought to}} cause the disease. However, {{it has also been}} suggested that the disease is mainly genetic. Residents in Karain village were traced from 1990 to 2006. Mineral samples were obtained from stones used in construction of their houses and any fibers present were identified. All women who had moved to the village as brides were traced and their cause of death determined. MM was the cause of death in 52 of 322 villagers, representing 50. 5 % of all deaths. Only 2 of 8 types of stones used in construction contained <b>erionite,</b> and these stones had been used almost exclusively in the mid-sections of the village, where MM was common. In houses not containing <b>erionite,</b> no cases of MM were observed. Sixty-four women came as brides to Karain from villages where <b>erionite</b> or asbestos is not found. Of the 16 women who have died, 11 (69 %) died from MM. The extreme risk of MM in Karain is due to indoor exposure to <b>erionite.</b> The effect of genetic factors on mesothelioma development cannot be evaluated in this study, but is likely to be minor.

40|$|Zeolites {{belonging}} to <b>erionite</b> and offretite families were recently discovered {{to be very}} dangerous for the human health since demonstrated to be carcinogenic (e. g. Carbone et al., 2007; Dogan et al., 2008). Notwithstanding this, the morphologies of <b>erionite</b> and offretite fibers {{have not yet been}} fully understood and many mineralogical and toxicological aspects are still unknown. Moreover, it is unclear whether the mineralogical similarity between <b>erionite</b> and offretite has any health implications. For these reasons, it is of paramount importance to improve the knowledge of their physical and chemical properties because they {{may be related to the}} carcinogenic potential of these fibrous zeolites. Identification of (and distinction between) <b>erionite</b> and offretite can be difficult because of (i) their mineralogical similarities and (ii) the possibility of intergrowth of the two species within each crystal (Passaglia et al., 1998). Here we present morphological and chemical data of <b>erionite</b> and offretite samples, collected from various localities. Four main morphological types of crystals have been observed. (I) Elongated prisms, often grouped in sub-spherical forms, with a strong tendency to develop thin fibers. (II) Very elongated, fibrous prisms, terminated by a wider, massive form with pseudo-hexagonal section. (III) Stocky prismatic forms, with a strong tendency to generate fibers at the ends of the crystals. (IV) Extremely fibrous crystals with "soft" appearance, which can be found both as single-phases and in epitaxial growth with other minerals. Chemical data indicate the presence of a wide range of compositions, based on extra-framework dominant cation. Types I and III can be referred to both offretite and <b>erionite</b> compositions; this latter has been found as K-, Na- and Caerionite. Type II shows a notably chemical variation: the prismatic, fibrous body corresponds to Na-erionite, while the wider, massive termination is offretite. Type IV is always <b>erionite</b> (both K- and Ca-members) and no offretite samples have been found with this extremely fibrous habit. Intermediate chemical compositions could be natural or due to intimate intergrowths of these two minerals. A better understanding of the potential toxicity is needed across the range of <b>erionite</b> and offretite compositions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Erionite,</b> a fibrous zeolite mineral, {{has been}} {{categorized}} {{as a class}} I carcinogenic agent for its causative role in mesothelioma. In select villages in Turkey, <b>erionite</b> {{is the cause of}} more than 50 % of mesotheliomas. In contrast, in the United States mesotheliomas are frequently associated with asbestos exposure. We describe the first reported case of a patient with erionite-associated pleural mesothelioma with classic pathologic changes typical of asbestos-related pulmonary and pleural pathology. This case report indicates that in addition to Turkey, erionite-associated disease can occur in North America and that subjects with <b>erionite</b> exposure are not only at risk of developing mesothelioma, but may develop interstitial fibrosis and additional pulmonary pathology impacting lung function and patient survival...|$|E
40|$|Background:The Kandovan {{region in}} Iran is {{physically}} and geologically {{similar to the}} Cappadocian region in Turkey where fibrous zeolites, including <b>erionite,</b> {{have been found in}} volcanic tuffs. In some Cappodocian villages there is strong evidence that <b>erionite,</b> and possibly related minerals, are responsible for the high level of mesothelioma found there. So, although mesothelioma clusters have not been reported in Kandovan, it is a plausible hypothesis that many cases of mesothelioma in Iran may be due to naturally occurring fibrous zeolites. Methods: A detailed study of Iranian geology was made to determine similarities between the Kandovan region and Cappadocia, ‘inter-mountain zones’ in the Western US and Mexico. Areas where mesothelioma cases probably attributable to <b>erionite</b> exposure have been found. Results:Although there is a long history of asbestos use in Iran many cases of mesothelioma do not present with positive asbestos exposure histories. Since fibrous zeolites are so widespread, why have not more mesotheliomas attributable to them been found throughout Iran? Various possible reasons were explored including misdiagnosis, poor surveillance, a general lack of awareness that this tumor may be linked to mineral fibre exposure. There is also the analytical problem of identifying fibrous <b>erionite</b> in lung tissue. Conclusions:There is every reason to believe mesotheliomas due to fibrous zeolite including <b>erionite</b> will be found in Iran. The most likely places to find them are the villages that look very similar to those found in Cappadocia since these are based upon similar geological formations...|$|E
