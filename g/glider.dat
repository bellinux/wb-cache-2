5|$|In an aerotow a powered {{aircraft}} {{is attached}} to a <b>glider</b> with a tow rope. Single-engined light aircraft or motor gliders are commonly used. The tow-plane takes the <b>glider</b> to the height and location requested by the pilot where the <b>glider</b> pilot releases the tow-rope. A weak link is often fitted to the rope to ensure that any sudden loads do not damage the airframe of the tow-plane or the <b>glider.</b> Under extreme loads the weak link will fail before any part of the <b>glider</b> or plane fails. There is a remote chance that the weak link might break at low altitude, and so pilots plan for this eventuality before launching.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Glider</b> Pilot Scholarship (GPS) {{program is}} a six-week course with an {{intensive}} programme of ground school and in-flight <b>glider</b> pilot training. Cadets who successfully complete their flight test and Transport Canada written exam will qualify for a <b>glider</b> pilot licence and be awarded Air Cadet <b>Glider</b> Pilot Wings.The {{program is a}}lso responsible for producing {{the largest number of}} <b>glider</b> pilots within Canada. On average, the program produces 320 <b>glider</b> pilots annually. Upon attaining their licences, these pilots join their local headquarters to provide other cadets with <b>glider</b> familiarization flying during the spring and fall seasons.|$|E
5|$|Air-landing {{obstacles}} {{were not}} the only tactic Rommel used against aerial invaders. Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that <b>glider</b> troops and paratroops landing in the water would drown. He ordered machine gun crews to cover the exits of fields that were bounded by bocage—tall, dense hedgerows—so that <b>glider</b> infantry and paratroopers would come under fire as they moved out of their landing area. The bocage hedgerows themselves were the worse hazard to safe <b>glider</b> landings, and caused more <b>glider</b> casualties than Rommelspargel.|$|E

5000|$|Motor <b>gliders</b> are <b>gliders</b> with engines {{which can}} be used for {{extending}} a flight and even, in some cases, for take-off.

Other motor <b>gliders</b> have enough thrust to launch themselves before the engine is retracted and are known as [...] "self-launching" [...] <b>gliders.</b> Another type is the self-launching [...] "touring motor glider", where the pilot can switch the engine on and off in flight without retracting their propellers.|$|R

5|$|The Douglas XCG-17 was an American assault <b>glider,</b> {{developed}} by the conversion of a C-47 Skytrain twin-engine transport during World War II. Although the XCG-17 was successful in testing, the requirement for such a large <b>glider</b> had passed, and no further examples of the type were built; one additional C-47, however, was converted {{in the field to}} <b>glider</b> configuration briefly during 1946 for evaluation, but was quickly reconverted to powered configuration.|$|E
5|$|When the <b>glider</b> was {{carrying}} tanks or other vehicles, common practice was that their engines would be {{started in the}} air, usually {{just prior to the}} <b>glider</b> casting off from the tug; special exhaust ducts were fitted to the <b>glider</b> to expel exhaust fumes. The Tetrarch and M22 Locust light tanks were so large that they barely fit inside the <b>glider,</b> and as such their crews stayed inside the tank {{for the duration of the}} flight. Once the <b>glider</b> landed, the anchorages keeping the vehicle stationary would be released by the driver pulling a lanyard within his reach, and the driver would then drive the tank forward, which automatically pulled a line that operated the swing door release. Universal Carriers and other vehicles relied on one of the pilots operating the door line manually. This was achieved by the pilot sliding down the fuselage and then dropping to the ground. They would then go to each undercarriage leg and release the valves there, which would expel hydraulic fluid and allow the shock absorbers struts to deflate, and then enter the <b>glider</b> and operate the door release line. If the swing door was jammed after the <b>glider</b> had landed, it was possible for tanks to break through the unopened forward fuselage and drive straight out of the <b>glider,</b> which occurred in both airborne operations where Hamilcars transported tanks.|$|E

5|$|Although the XCG-17 {{failed to}} lead to any {{production}} of a C-47 derived <b>glider</b> type, a single C-47 was converted {{in the field to}} <b>glider</b> configuration by the Fifth Air Service Area Command, located at Nichols Field on Luzon in the Philippines, during January 1946. Carried out in much the same manner as the XCG-17, the conversion included octagonally shaped fairings over the engine mountings, with an auxiliary power unit from a B-24 Liberator bomber being installed.|$|E
5|$|Capper {{oversaw the}} first Army aeroplanes. He briefly flew Dunne's first <b>glider,</b> the D.1, during secret trials at Blair Atholl in Scotland in 1907.

The next year, Cody flew the first British-built aeroplane at Farnborough, which earned it the title British Army Aeroplane No.1.

50|$|The two {{air sports}} {{that are most}} closely related to gliding are hang gliding and paragliding. Although all three sports rely on rising air, there are {{significant}} differences which are listed in detail in a comparison of sailplanes hang <b>gliders</b> and paragliders. The main difference is that both hang <b>gliders</b> and paragliders are simpler, less sophisticated and cheaper aircraft that use the pilot's feet as the undercarriage. All paragliders and most hang <b>gliders</b> have no protective structure around the pilot. However, the dividing line between basic <b>gliders</b> and sophisticated hang-gliders is becoming less distinct. For example, hang <b>gliders</b> typically use fabric wings, shaped over a framework, but hang <b>gliders</b> with rigid wings and three-axis controls are also available. The lower air speeds and lower glide ratios of typical hang <b>gliders</b> means that shorter cross-country distances are flown than in modern <b>gliders.</b> Paragliders are more basic craft. They are also foot-launched, but their wings usually have no frames and their shape is created by the flow and pressure of air. The airspeeds and glide ratios of paragliders are generally lower still than the typical hang <b>gliders,</b> and so their cross-country flights are even shorter. Radio-controlled gliding uses scale-models of <b>gliders</b> mainly for ridge soaring; however thermic aeromodelling craft are also used.|$|R

5|$|Graf saw {{his first}} {{aircraft}} {{when he was}} twelve years old. This sight created a conflict between his passion for football and a new obsession with flying. From 1930, {{he worked at the}} Engen town hall and saved all his money to buy a <b>glider.</b> Before his 20th birthday, he provided a homemade <b>glider</b> to the new Engen Sailplane Club. Every Sunday he would go out to the nearby Ballenberg mountain until a heavy crash destroyed his <b>glider</b> in the fall of 1932. In 1935, after Adolf Hitler officially revoked the Treaty of Versailles, Graf applied for flight training in the newly created Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann's flying {{career began}} {{when he joined the}} <b>glider</b> {{training}} program of the fledgling Luftwaffe and was taught to fly by his mother, one of the first female <b>glider</b> pilots in Germany. The Hartmanns also owned a light aircraft but were forced to sell it in 1932 as the German economy collapsed. The rise to power of the Nazi Party in 1933 resulted in government support for gliding, and, in 1936, Elisabeth Hartmann established the <b>glider</b> club in Weil im Schönbuch in 1936 for locals and served as instructress. The 14-year-old Hartmann became an instructor. In 1939, he gained his pilot's license, allowing him to fly powered aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|Scale <b>gliders</b> are {{models of}} {{full-size}} <b>gliders.</b> Scale <b>gliders</b> are generally larger models (2 m wingspan or greater) and made from composite materials. Scale <b>Gliders</b> are sometimes modified slightly {{to obtain the}} best flying characteristics, such as less drag and more aerobatic potential.

Some scale <b>gliders</b> are very close in appearance to their full scale counterparts, and this makes them a beautiful sight at any flying field. A model often [...] "scaled" [...] because of its clean looks and great aerobatic potential is the MDM-1 Fox. The ASW series (mostly ASW-26 and ASW-28) are also popular scale <b>gliders.</b>|$|R
