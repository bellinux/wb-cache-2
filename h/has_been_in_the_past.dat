500|$|Taxon is the {{bi-monthly}} {{journal of}} the IAPT. The journal, which was initiated in 1951, publishes original papers and reviews dealing with systematic botany in the broadest sense. Preference is given to integrative papers combining the results of modern analysis with their consequences for classification. Taxon also contains matters related to botanical nomenclature, and is the medium for the publication of both proposals to conserve or reject names and proposals to amend the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN). Publication of such matters in Taxon satisfies the required submission to the General Committee. The journal also contains sections devoted to the International Organisation of Plant Biosystematics, reviews and notices of books and other publications, and news {{in the world of}} plant systematics. [...] Although the journal is [...] "devoted to systematic and evolutionary biology with emphasis on botany", it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> criticized for focusing overly on nomenclature and less on the principles and advancements made in the field of plant systematics.|$|E

The character previously dated Andy Dwyer and Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider), who was written out of the show {{at the end of}} the second season. In both cases, Ann was primarily in control of the relationship due to Andy's immaturity and Mark's lack of experience in long-term romances. Schur said of Ann's relationship with Chris, [...] "This is the first time that Ann just completely loses herself and really falls for a guy super hard. And the relationship goes in a lot of funny, unexpected directions." [...] Intimidated by her inability to find a flaw in the extremely positive and physically perfect Chris, Ann acts more awkwardly and nerdy around him than her character <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> [...] "Flu Season" [...] {{also demonstrated}} deeper levels to Ron Swanson, who adamantly insists [...] "I'm not interested in caring about people", yet reveals he cares about both Andy and April, and tries to help the two reconcile. Schur said Ron takes on a sort of father figure role, [...] "and he ends up revealing in a tiny, tiny, tiny way that's still true to the character that he has genuine feelings of caring for the people who work around him in the Parks office".|$|E
50|$|Another AGA study <b>was</b> used <b>in</b> {{assessing}} <b>the</b> cultural adaption of Filipinos who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Navy. Three {{groups of}} Filipinos {{were compared to}} similarly composed groups of Americans: those who were newly recruited to the U.S. Navy, those who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Navy between 1 and 10 years, and those who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Navy from 11 to 25 years. The results indicated that cultural adaptation occurred most in domains such as “Work” and “Service.” Cultural adaptation occurred least in domains such as “Family,” “Friends,” “Society,” “Interpersonal Relations,” and “Religion.” These domains are most influenced by tradition and early socialization. This study also revealed that cultural adaption is also a function of time spent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> host environment. The change from the first group (new recruits) to the second group (those who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Navy 1-10 years) is faster than the change from the second group to the third group (those who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Navy 11-25 years).|$|R

2500|$|An ant is {{a simple}} {{computational}} agent in the ant colony optimization algorithm. It iteratively constructs a solution for the problem at hand.

Thus, each ant [...] computes a set [...] of feasible expansions to its current state in each iteration, and moves to one of these in probability. For ant , the probability [...] of moving from state [...] to state [...] depends on the combination of two values, viz., the attractiveness [...] of the move, as computed by some heuristic indicating the a priori desirability of that move and the trail level [...] of the move, indicating how proficient it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> to make that particular move.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cornerstone}} of Hume's epistemology {{is the problem}} of induction. This may be the area of Hume's thought where his scepticism about human powers of reason is most pronounced. The problem revolves around the plausibility of inductive reasoning, that is, reasoning from the observed behaviour of objects to their behaviour when unobserved. As Hume wrote, induction concerns how things behave when they go [...] "beyond the present testimony of the senses, or the records of our memory". Hume argues that we tend to believe that things behave in a regular manner, meaning that patterns in the behaviour of objects seem to persist into the future, and throughout the unobserved present. Hume's argument is that we cannot rationally justify the claim that nature will continue to be uniform, as justification comes in only two varieties—demonstrative reasoning and probable reasoning—and both of these are inadequate. With regard to demonstrative reasoning, Hume argues that the uniformity principle cannot be demonstrated, as it is [...] "consistent and conceivable" [...] that nature might stop being regular. Turning to probable reasoning, Hume argues that we cannot hold that nature will continue to be uniform because it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> As this is using the very sort of reasoning (induction) that is under question, it would be circular reasoning. Thus, no form of justification will rationally warrant our inductive inferences.|$|E
