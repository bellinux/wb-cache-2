50|$|Though every {{situation}} is different, {{there is some}} controversy {{about the effectiveness of}} attic fans.

In the past many teams used to adjust the radiator intakes to allow for extra airflow, creating the once-common [...] "Monaco nose". Teams also use closer ratio gears, as there are hardly any long straights in Monaco and acceleration is at a premium. A special steering rack with a larger pinion gear is also fitted to allow the cars to be driven around the tightest corners. Some Formula One teams use other specifically designed components for this circuit.|$|E
50|$|An engine needs {{different}} temperatures. The inlet {{including the}} compressor of a turbo {{and in the}} inlet trumpets and the inlet valves need to be as cold as possible. A countercurrent heat exchange with <b>forced</b> <b>cooling</b> air does the job. The cylinder-walls should not heat up the air before compression, but also not cool down the gas at the combustion. A compromise is a wall temperature of 90 °C. The viscosity of the oil is optimized for just this temperature. Any cooling of the exhaust and the turbine of the turbocharger reduces the amount of power available to the turbine, so the exhaust system is often insulated between engine and turbocharger to keep the exhaust gases as hot as possible.|$|E

40|$|The Vlasov {{technique}} {{is used to}} model the electron <b>cooling</b> <b>force.</b> Limitations of {{the applicability of the}} method is obtained by considering the perturbations of the electron plasma. Analytical expressions of the electron <b>cooling</b> <b>force,</b> valid beyond the Coulomb logarithm approximation, are derived and compared to numerical calculations using adaptive Monte Carlo integration. The calculated longitudinal <b>cooling</b> <b>force</b> is veriﬁed with measurements in CELSIUS. Transverse damping rates of betatron oscillations for a nonlinear <b>cooling</b> <b>force</b> is explored. Experimental data of the transverse monochromatic instability is used to determine the rms angular spread due to solenoid ﬁeld imperfections in CELSIUS. The result, θrms= 0. 16 ± 0. 02 mrad, is in agreement with the longitudinal <b>cooling</b> <b>force</b> measurements. This veriﬁes {{the internal consistency of the}} model and shows that the transverse and longitudinal <b>cooling</b> <b>force</b> components have different velocity dependences. Simulations of electron cooling with applications to HESR show that the momentum reso- lution ∆p/p smaller than 10 − 5 is feasible, as needed for the charmonium spectroscopy in the experimental program of PANDA. By deﬂecting the electron beam angle to make use of the monochromatic instability, a reasonable overlap between the circulating antiproton beam and the internal target can be maintained. The simulations also indicate that the cooling time is considerably shorter than expected...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the available current carrying capacity of high voltage cables, utilities may employ <b>forced</b> water <b>cooling</b> within power transmission networks to remove the heat from cable groups.

50|$|A more {{commonly}} used method when extended heat is not a concern is to use an autoclave or pressure cooker. When sterilizing in this way, samples are placed into a steam chamber on a shelf or raised floor, and the chamber is closed and heated so that steam forces {{air out of the}} vents or exhausts. Pressure is then applied so that the interior temperature reaches , and this temperature is maintained for between 15 and 30 minutes. This elevated temperature and pressure is sufficient to sterilize samples of any commonly encountered microbes or spores. The chamber is then allowed to cool slowly or by passive heat dissipation; it is rare for <b>forced</b> <b>cooling</b> to be applied, or for pressure to be vented deliberately. Pressure sterilization is the prevailing method used for medical sterilization of heat-resistant tools, and for sterilization of materials for microbiology and other fields calling for aseptic technique.|$|E
5000|$|Smaller arc {{furnaces}} may {{be adequately}} cooled by circulation of air over structural {{elements of the}} shell and roof, but larger installations require intensive <b>forced</b> <b>cooling</b> to maintain the structure within safe operating limits. The furnace shell and roof may be cooled either by water circulated through pipes which form a panel, or by water sprayed on the panel elements. Tubular panels may be replaced when they become cracked or reach their thermal stress life cycle. Spray cooling is the most economical and is the highest efficiency cooling method. A spray cooling piece of equipment can be relined almost endlessly; equipment that lasts 20 years is the norm. However while a tubular leak is immediately noticed in an operating furnace due to the pressure loss alarms on the panels, at this time there exists no immediate way of detecting a very small volume spray cooling leak. These typically hide behind slag coverage and can hydrate the refractory in the hearth leading to a break out of molten metal or in the worst case a steam explosion.|$|E
