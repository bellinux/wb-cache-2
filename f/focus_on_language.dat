25|$|He {{obtained}} US {{citizenship in}} 1940, believing {{that as an}} American citizen, he would have greater opportunity to influence U.S. policies toward Italy. In fact, government agencies like the State Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), solicited his advice on Fascism and Italian matters in general. Notable writings of the American years include Under the Axe of Fascism (1936). As an intellectual Salvemini left an undeniable mark {{on the study of}} Italian history at Harvard and other universities, changing their original <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>language,</b> art and literature, to a critical and systematic study into modern Italy.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{inception}} of the discipline of linguistics, linguists have been concerned with describing and analysing previously undocumented languages. Starting with Franz Boas in the early 1900s, this became the main focus of American linguistics until the rise of formal structural linguistics in the mid-20th century. This <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>language</b> documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly disappearing languages of indigenous peoples. The ethnographic dimension of the Boasian approach to language description {{played a role in the}} development of disciplines such as sociolinguistics, anthropological linguistics, and linguistic anthropology, which investigate the relations between language, culture, and society.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} pedagogy {{of moderate}} expressivism {{is characterized by}} a <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>language</b> as a tool for personal rather than social expression, based on the process theory of composition, a belief that the process of writing should be more important than the final product. Further, moderate expressivist pedagogy calls for less grammatical standards and an increased focus on the writer’s process of discovery and expression. W.E. Coles, Jr. suggests that teaching writing should be approached as teaching art, with the teacher serving as facilitator or guide for the student-writer’s free expression; he also calls for classroom practices such as peer-reviews, class discussions, and the absence of grades, in order to best guide the self-identification he sees as crucial to the writing process. Fellow moderate expressivist Donald Murray maintains that writing is a process of discovery and experimentation, a search for truth in a specious world; his manifesto-like essay provides an apt summation of the arguments against the dated pedagogy of CTR. Likewise, Maxine Hairston recognizes the paradigm shift occurring in rhetoric and composition and calls for a non-prescriptive atmosphere in teaching, including less focus on grammar and syntax and, again, more concern with the process of growth experienced by the writer. Peter Elbow reflects moderate expressivist ideals in his claim that audience should be ignored during {{the early stages of the}} writing process, in order to avoid the hindrance of audience expectation and facilitate writer-based rather than reader-based text. Elbow writes, “It’s not that writers should never think about their audience. It’s a question of when.” Simply put, moderate expressivism promotes the notion of process over product, a pedagogy that evolved in the height of the 1960s and in many ways reflects the ideologies of the era in its emphasis on freedom, expression, discovery, and a search for the writer’s authentic self.|$|E
500|$|The {{dictator}} novel {{came back}} into fashion in the 1970s, {{towards the end of}} the Boom. As Sharon Keefe Ugalde remarks, [...] "the 1970s mark a new stage in the evolution of the Latin American dictator novel, characterized by at least two developments: a change in the perspective from which the dictator is viewed and a new focus on the nature of language." [...] By this she means that the dictator novels of the 1970s, such as The Autumn of the Patriarch or I, the Supreme, offer the reader a more intimate view of their subject: [...] "the dictator becomes protagonist" [...] and the world is often seen from his point of view. With the new <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>language,</b> Keefe Ugalde points to the realisation on the part of many authors that [...] "the tyrant's power is derived from and defeated by language." [...] For example, in Jorge Zalamea's El Gran Burundún Burundá ha muerto the dictator bans all forms of language.|$|E
