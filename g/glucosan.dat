40|$|Biomass burning is a {{major source}} of {{greenhouse}} gases and influences regional to global climate. Pre-industrial fire-history records from black carbon, charcoal and other proxies provide baseline estimates of biomass burning at local to global scales spanning millennia, and are thus use- ful to examine the role of fire in the carbon cycle and climate system. Here we use the specific biomarker levo- <b>glucosan</b> together with black carbon and ammonium concen- trations from the North Greenland Eemian (NEEM) ice cores ◦◦ (77. 49 N, 51. 2 W; 2480 ma. s. l) over the past 2000 years to infer changes in boreal fire activity. Increases in boreal fire activity over the periods 1000 – 1300 CE and decreases during 700 – 900 CE coincide with high-latitude NH temper- ature changes. Levoglucosan concentrations in the NEEM ice cores peak between 1500 and 1700 CE, and most levo- <b>glucosan</b> spikes coincide with the most extensive central and northern Asian droughts of the past millennium. Many of these multi-annual droughts are caused by Asian mon- soon failures, thus suggesting a connection between low- and high-latitude climate processes. North America is a primary source of biomass burning aerosols due to its relative prox- imity to the Greenland Ice Cap. During major fire events, however, isotopic analyses of dust, back trajectories and links with levoglucosan peaks and regional drought reconstruc- tions suggest that Siberia is also an important source of py- rogenic aerosols to Greenland...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1952 The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the nature of the chemical constituents of incense cedar bark with the hope that such an endeavor would spur future research, development and use of a now neglected natural raw material. The bark from nine trees, which were separated into three age groups, was sampled from the bottom, middle and top sections. The age groups were 146 - 195 years, 261 - 285 years and 326 - 351 years. The nine samples were successively extracted with hexane, benzene, ethyl ether, hot water and 95 per cent ethanol to show the distribution and amounts of the extractives. The total extractive content varied between 13. 70 per cent for the bottom sample of the oldest age group and 30. 39 per cent for the top sample of the youngest age group. Similarly, the total extractive content of Port Orford cedar bark was found to range from 15. 49 per cent to 25. 69 per cent with the distribution corresponding closely to that of incense cedar. In both species, the greatest amount of extraneous material was removed with hot water and the variations between the total extractive content of the bottom and top samples were due primarily to the deviations in the amounts of this extract. The hexane extract was found to comprise 3. 53 per cent of the ovendry unextracted bark. The components of the hexane extract and the yields based on the oven-dry weight of the hexane solubles were: volatile oil, 0. 95 per cent; crystalline fatty ester, 5. 83 per cent; free acids, 46. 21 per cent; neutrals, 46. 67 per cent; and undetermined, 0. 34 per cent. Saponification of the crystalline fatty ester gave cerotic acid and an alcohol fraction equivalent to a mixture of behenyl and lignoceryl alcohols. The free acids were shown to contain 1. 93 per cent resin acids, 1. 11 per cent of a crystalline acid fraction equivalent to a mixture of behenic and lignoceric acids, and a fatty acid fraction, having a neutral equivalent of 435. 8 and a Hanus iodine number of 41. 2, which comprised 44. 28 per cent of the hexane solubles. The neutral fraction contained 25. 08 per cent combined acids, which had a neutral equivalent of 446. 6 and a Hanus iodine number of 80. 1, and 21. 59 per cent unsaponifiables from which a crystalline phytosterol was isolated in a yield of 1. 07 per cent of the hexane solubles. The yield of benzene soluble material was 2. 46 per cent of the ovendry unextracted bark. The major components of this extract were resin acids, present in both the free and combined forms. The yield of free resin acids was 64. 4 per cent of the benzene extract; the fraction melted at 181 - 182 ° C., had a neutral equivalent of 347. 7 and was optically active. The combined resin acids comprised 7. 8 per cent of the benzene solubles. They melted at 151 - 152 ° C., had a neutral equivalent of 358. 0 and were optically active. The remainder of the benzene extract was found to contain 8. 2 per cent free fatty acids, 10. 8 per cent combined fatty acids and 8. 2 per cent unsaponifiables. The tannin content of incense cedar bark ranged from 3. 5 to 7. 8 per cent, whereas that of Port Orford cedar varied between 4. 2 and 7. 0 per cent. These tannin yields are insufficient for economical commercial extraction. A crude carbohydrate material was obtained with hot water in a yield of approximately nine per cent of the oven-dry weight of unextracted bark. It contained 65. 9 per cent reducing sugars, 24. 0 per cent tannin and 10. 2 per cent insolubles. The composition of the reducing sugars based on the crude carbohydrate material was: pentosans, 13. 46 per cent; mannans, 3. 09 per cent; galactans, 21. 50 per cent; uronic anhydride, 1. 87 per cent; and <b>glucosans,</b> 25. 98 per cent. A composite sample of unextracted bark contained 14. 93 per cent alcohol-benzene solubles; 3. 04 per cent alcohol solubles, 7. 47 per cent hot-water solubles, 37. 06 per cent lignin, 36. 40 per cent holocellulose, 8. 51 per cent pentosans, 2. 69 per cent methoxyl, 0. 59 per cent acetyl, and 0. 97 per cent ash...|$|R
40|$|Scientists from Oregon State University, USA, came up {{with the}} newest theory of the sixth taste – starch taste that might soon join the basic five tastes. This {{argument}} is supported by studies done on both animals and humans, the results of which seem to indicate the existence of separate receptors for starch taste, others than for sweet taste. Starch is a glucose homopolymer that forms an α-glucoside chain called <b>glucosan</b> or glucan. This polysaccharide constitutes the most important source of carbohydrates in food. It can be found in groats, potatoes, legumes, grains, manioc and corn. Apart from its presence in food, starch is also used in textile, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and stationery industries as well as in glue production. This polysaccharide is made of an unbranched helical structure – amylose (15 – 20...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: When {{in vitro}} fermentations of glucose, {{fructose}} or sucrose {{are carried out}} under conditions comparable {{with those in the}} rumen by means of relatively small inocula of strained rumen contents from hay-fed sheep, the holotrichously ciliated protozoa which are present store immense numbers of microscopic granules consisting of a practically protein-free <b>glucosan</b> giving a purple colour with iodine. The granules can be liberated by bursting the protozoa by the action of the synthetic detergent Teepol XL under mild conditions. An exactly similar polysaccharide granule preparation can be made from protozoa present in the rumen itself if rumen contents are withdrawn 2 - 41 hr. after feeding. The yield of iodophilic polysaccharide so obtained may be equivalent to approximately 25 yo of the weight of water-soluble, yeast-fermentable sugars in a single feed of hay. No granule-filled protozoa are present 9 hr. after feeding. Other simple sugars such as glucuronolactone, galactose, mannose, xylose, ara-binose, sorbose, lactose, cellobiose and maltose, are not markedly converted into polysaccharide granules by rumen protozoa, during in witro fermentation...|$|E
