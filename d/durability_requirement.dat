This paper showed the importance of review of design at early stages to uncover possible faults, reduce risks of flaws, thereby ensuring that it meets the <b>durability</b> <b>requirement</b> in a safe, functional and cost effective manner.

40|$|Normally in {{reinforced}} concrete structures, the reinforcing steel is well protected against corrosion by concrete. The reinforcing steel remains passive under high alkalinity. However, the highly desirable <b>durability</b> <b>requirement</b> {{is not always}} achieved in practice due to various environmental factors. Corrosion of reinforcement in concrete is a common cause of deterioration in many RC structures. Two main cause of corrosion of reinforcement in concrete are: Carbonation and presence of Chloride ions. Carbonation {{is the result of}} the chemical reaction between carbon dioxide gases in the atmosphere and alkaline hydroxides in the concrete. The rate of carbonation depends on the thickness of the concrete cover and also on its quality in terms of the mixing ratios that achieve the highest quality. The relative humidity and temperature mainly affects the carbonation of concrete. Permeability, nature and intensity of cracks, and cover thickness will influence the initiation and sustenance of reinforcement corrosion. The expansion of the corroding steel causes surface cracking and subsequent spalling of the cover concrete.

40|$|The {{phase of}} {{building}} management has a strategic importance {{because of the}} necessary scheduling of maintenance during executive planning. Moreover, {{in order to obtain}} the greatest sustainability of the intervention, a reasonable duration of service life must be balanced with global quality-cost ratio. A contribution towards this objective is given by the reduction in the achievable resources and raw materials consumption through the improvement of the <b>durability</b> <b>requirement</b> of building and its parts. This is true even for the interventions on the existing public building stock, especially if there is lacking of maintenance planning and scheduling. This work, taking cues from a maintenance intervention "at happened breakdown" on an Engineering school building in Palermo, deals with the introduction of process innovations in the management phase, directed towards preventive intervention strategies. Beyond the collection of the informative data, the time behaviour of envelope surfaces is monitored through a viewpoint system. Particular attention has been given to the finishing plaster (rasante) layer and the relative colour, to be evaluated depending on the different technical solutions and exposure to weather conditions. The study, following the methodology of ISO 15686, also foresees accelerated ageing tests on samples of different materials, in order to formulate hypothesis and correlations on the degradation evolution, from a maintenance planning and scheduling viewpoint. The correlations were obtained by taking the colour difference as a representative parameter of the evolution of colour in natural and artificial aging conditions. The results show that the different exposure of surfaces to weathering induces a different decay of surfaces colour, compatible with that induced in the laboratory at different steps of artificial aging...|$|E

40|$|The {{demands for}} {{improved}} fuel economy, performance and emissions continue to pose challenges for engine designers and the materials they choose. This {{is particularly true}} for modern diesel engines, where the primary path to achieving improved engine performance and emissions {{is to increase the}} Peak Firing Pressure in the combustion chamber. The resulting increase in thermal and mechanical loading has required a change from conventional grey cast iron to Compacted Graphite Iron (CGI) in order to satisfy <b>durability</b> <b>requirements</b> without increasing the size or the weight of the engines.

40|$|Haynes 188, a cobalt-based superalloy, {{will be used}} to make {{thermal energy}} storage (TES) {{containment}} canisters for a 2 kW solar dynamic ground test demonstrator (SD GTD). Haynes 188 containment canisters with a high thermal emittance (epsilon) are desired for radiating heat away from local hot spots, improving the heating distribution, which will in turn improve canister service life. In addition to needing a high emittance, the surface needs to be durable in an elevated temperature, high vacuum environment for an extended time period. Thirty-five Haynes 188 samples were exposed to 14 different types of surface modification techniques for emittance and vacuum heat treatment (VHT) durability enhancement evaluation. Optical properties were obtained for the modified surfaces. Emittance enhanced samples were exposed to VHT for up to 2692 hours at 827 C and {{less than or equal to}} 10 (exp - 6) torr with integral thermal cycling. Optical properties were taken intermittently during exposure, and after final VHT exposure. The various surface modification treatments increased the emittance of pristine Haynes 188 from 0. 11 up to 0. 86. Seven different surface modification techniques were found to provide surfaces which met the SD GTD receiver VHT <b>durability</b> <b>requirement.</b> Of the 7 surface treatments, 2 were found to display excellent VHT durability: an alumina based (AB) coating and a zirconia based coating. The alumina based coating was chosen for the epsilon enhancement surface modification technique for the SD GTD receiver.

Large {{volume of}} {{reclaimed}} asphalt pavements (RAP) aggregates are generated during pavement rehabilitation and reconstruction and disposed along road alignment while {{large quantities of}} groundnut shell ash (GSA) are generated from the combustion of groundnut shell and also disposed in large quantities on production sites. This paper presents results of the laboratory evaluation {{of the characteristics of}} GSA stabilized RAP with a view to determining its suitability for use as highway pavement material in flexible pavements construction. The RAP-GSA mixtures were subjected to British standard light (BSL) (standard Proctor) compactive effort to determine the compaction characteristics and California bearing ratio (CBR). Test results show that the properties of RAP improved with GSA treatment. The particle grading improved from 99. 13 % coarse aggregate and 0. 87 % fines, with AASHTO classification of A- 1 -b for 100 % RAP and 9. 08 % coarse aggregate and 90. 92 % fines, with AASHTO classification of A- 4 for 100 % GSA to 15. 66 – 91. 72 % coarse aggregate and 8. 28 – 84. 32 % fines, with AASHTO classification in the range A- 4 (silty soil) to A- 1 -a [granular materials], for the various RAP-GSA mixes. Maximum dry density (MDD) decreased while the optimum moisture content (OMC) increased with higher GSA content in the RAP + GSA mixes. Optimum CBR values of 22. 2 % (unsoaked) and 18. 3 % (soaked) were recorded for 80 % RAP + 20 % GSA and 90 % RAP + 10 % GSA mixes, respectively. This optimum mixes satisfied <b>durability</b> <b>requirement</b> with insignificant water absorption and can be used as subgrade material in flexible pavements.

40|$|The Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) will {{be placed}} in an orbit that will subject it to {{constant}} solar radiation during its planned 10 -year mission. A sunshield {{will be necessary to}} passively cool the telescope, protecting it from the Sun s energy and assuring proper operating temperatures for the telescope s instruments. This sunshield will be composed of metalized polymer multilayer insulation with an outer polymer membrane (12 to 25 mm in thickness) that will be metalized on the back to assure maximum reflectance of sunlight. The sunshield must maintain mechanical integrity and optical properties for the full 10 years. This <b>durability</b> <b>requirement</b> is most challenging for the outermost, constantly solar-facing polymer membrane of the sunshield. One of the potential threats to the membrane material s durability is from vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation in wavelengths below 200 nm. Such radiation can be absorbed in the bulk of these thin polymer membrane materials and degrade the polymer s optical and mechanical properties. So that a suitable membrane material can be selected that demonstrates durability to solar VUV radiation, ground-based testing of candidate materials must be conducted to simulate the total 10 - year VUV exposure expected during the Next Generation Space Telescope mission. The Steady State Vacuum Ultraviolet exposure facility was designed and fabricated at the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field to provide unattended 24 -hr exposure of candidate materials to VUV radiation of 3 to 5 times the Sun s intensity in the wavelength range of 115 to 200 nm. The facility s chamber, which maintains a pressure of approximately 5 10 (exp - 6) torr, is divided into three individual exposure cells, each with a separate VUV source and sample-positioning mechanism. The three test cells are separated by a water-cooled copper shield plate assembly to minimize thermal effects from adjacent test cells. Part of the interior sample positioning mechanism of one test cell is shown in the illustration. Of primary concern in VUV exposure is the maintenance of constant measured radiation intensity so that the sample s total exposure can be determined in equivalent Sun hours. This is {{complicated by the fact that}} a VUV lamp s intensity degrades over time, necessitating a decrease in the distance between the test samples and the lamp. The facility overcomes this challenge by periodically measuring the lamp s intensity with a cesium-iodide phototube and adjusting the sample distance as required to maintain constant exposure intensity. Sample positioning and periodic phototube location under the lamp are both achieved by a single lead-screw assembly. The lamps can be isolated from the main vacuum chamber for cleaning or replacement so that samples are not exposed to the atmosphere during a test...|$|E

After over 30 years of R&D and lessons learned from failures, the geosynthetic industry has reached a very high level of knowledge with regard to durability concerns and associated material formulation. For each product, the list of degradation mechanisms can be drawn and a specification built. However, a significant fraction of geotechnical engineers are often not used to consider material aging issues, as long as this is not a concern for most of geotechnical applications, involving relatively inert materials like water and soil. This paper was thus prepared in order to introduce basic elements involved in geosynthetics aging. A review of polymer basic properties is presented in the first section, followed by a description of potential degradation mechanisms of typical geosynthetics polymers. It is believed that the understanding of these elements will help geotechnical engineers gain better acceptance of geosynthetics for long-term applications and help them specify the products with regard to the adequate degradation mechanisms.
