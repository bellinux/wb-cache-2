5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing}} to employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E
500|$|Zhuangzi {{seems to}} have viewed death as a natural process or transformation, where one gives up one form of {{existence}} and assumes another. In the second chapter, he makes the point that, for all humans know, death {{may in fact be}} better than life: [...] "How do I know that loving life is not a delusion? How do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> hating death I am not like a man who, having left home in his youth, has forgotten the way back?" [...] His writings teach that [...] "the wise man or woman accepts death with equanimity and thereby achieves absolute happiness." ...|$|E

60|$|When at last I heard quiet steps, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the Doña Maria {{had arisen}} from her prayers. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> her sorrowing heart {{there was a}} blessed faith, childlike and strong, that would help her to perform, quietly and correctly, the last sad offices for her dead.|$|R
60|$|I had {{no answer}} ready for him. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> my grief for Margaret I had been advocating an unworthy course, but I would not say so. I went gloomily to the door, and there, presently, his hand fell on my shoulder.|$|R
60|$|I am free to say, therefore, {{that the}} thought that your poor mother was devoting herself earnestly to religion, {{although}} after the forms of a church with which I differ, was to me {{a source of great}} consolation, because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> way alone could a soul like hers find peace.|$|R
2500|$|Hussein {{was born}} to a Muslim Fellah family in Musmus in 1936, during British Mandatory rule in Palestine. He {{attended}} elementary school in Umm al-Fahm, a town near his home village. He was educated in Nazareth, where he graduated from Nazareth Secondary School. Hussein {{described himself as a}} [...] "lax Muslim", once writing in 1961, [...] "I do not pray and I do not go to the mosque and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> this I am disobeying the will of God ... thousands of people like me are lax in fulfilling the divine precepts. But these disobedient thousands did not keep silent about what our pious judges who pray and fast, have kept silent".|$|E

60|$|I {{realized}} {{only too}} well all the dangers which were before us, and the odds against our being able to obey the general's orders.

60|$|She {{pointed to}} the man whom I had passed on {{entering}} the Mews. My cheeks began to burn and my knees to tremble, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> tracing the cravat to its owner I was advancing a step toward a fresh discovery. I wished Mrs. Horlick good evening, and said I would write and mention the day on which I wanted her.|$|R

60|$|She {{looked at}} Jim, and I never saw such {{eyes in a}} human head, so large, and black, and wonderful.

Yet I was pleased in spite of myself.|$|R
60|$|But {{to commit}} suicide on grounds of love is at the best a very dubious experiment. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> this I am expressing an opinion {{contrary}} to that of most true lovers who embrace suicide on the slightest provocation as the only honourable termination of an existence that never ought to have begun.|$|E
6000|$|Silence was restored, and the M.P. resumed: ‘Now, I {{know nothing}} so likely to effect this object, Miss Crumpton, as her mixing {{constantly}} {{in the society}} of girls of her own age; and, as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> your establishment she will meet such as {{are not likely to}} contaminate her young mind, I propose to send her to you.’ ...|$|E

6000|$|Calvert {{furnished}} other particulars {{before he}} resumed his eastward journey, leaving me with much to ponder.

6000|$|... "What could induce {{me to do}} as I did? Well, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> your mother's character,--no matter how.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> these wild days many clerics were {{careless}} as to {{that which}} the Church enjoins concerning the effusion of blood--nay, I have named John Kirkmichael, Bishop of Orleans, as having himself broken a spear {{on the body of}} the Duke of Clarence. The Abbe of Cerquenceaux, also, was a valiant man in religion, and a good captain, and, all over France, clerics were gripping to sword and spear. But such a priest as this I did not expect to see.|$|R

60|$|As far as I {{have sought}} any, {{not the best}} laid out garden or parterre has been my model--but Nature has been. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> a sense the garden is nature too, but I had to choose--I could not give both.
