5|$|Fifth Avenue roughly bisects Manhattan Island {{and acts}} as the <b>demarcation</b> <b>line</b> for east/west designations (e.g., East 27th Street, West 42nd Street); street {{addresses}} start at Fifth Avenue and increase heading away from Fifth Avenue, {{at a rate of}} 100 per block on most streets. South of Waverly Place, Fifth Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east/west <b>demarcation</b> <b>line.</b> Though the grid does start with 1st Street, just north of Houston Street (the southernmost street divided in west and east portions; pronounced HOW-stin), the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th Street, where nearly all east-west streets are numerically identified, which increase from south to north to 220th Street, the highest numbered street on the island. Streets in Midtown are usually one-way, with the few exceptions generally being the busiest cross-town thoroughfares (14th, 23rd, 34th, and 42nd Streets, for example), which are bidirectional across the width of Manhattan Island. The rule of thumb is that odd-numbered streets run west, while even-numbered streets run east.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{have been}} observing that a {{significant}} proportion of our patients, especially females, have certain pigmentary <b>demarcation</b> <b>lines</b> (PDL) over the face. However, systematic studies of the subject are lacking. AIMS: We categorized the different clinical patterns of facial PDLs in the Indian subpopulation and assessed their prevalence in this study. METHODS: About 4000 consecutive patients, both males and females, attending our skin clinic were examined for the presence of any pigmentary <b>demarcation</b> <b>lines</b> on the face, from October 1998 to February 2000. RESULTS: Out of the study population of 4037 patients, 243 (6 &#x 0025;) were found to have <b>demarcation</b> <b>lines</b> on the face. The <b>demarcation</b> <b>lines</b> were far more common in women (9 &#x 0025;) than in men (0. 75 &#x 0025;). These lines could be classified into three patterns that we would like to label as F, G, H as PDLs A to E have already been described. CONCLUSIONS: Pigmentary <b>demarcation</b> <b>lines</b> are fairly common in the Indian population especially amongst the females. Hormonal influences could possibly explain the female preponderance. Aggregation of cases within families or among close relatives suggests a genetic background...|$|R

5|$|In mid-May, Operation Trio was {{followed}} by the joint Italian-Chetnik offensive against Partisan detachments within the Italian zone of occupation in eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro, with similar effects: the Partisans lost almost all of the liberated territory in these areas. This offensive is also considered part of the Third Enemy Offensive in Yugoslav historiography. After Operation Trio, NDH forces remained south of the <b>demarcation</b> <b>line</b> between the German and Italian zones of occupation, in spite of protests from the Italians.|$|E
5|$|In {{the closing}} days of World War I, the Conference of Ambassadors drew the first <b>demarcation</b> <b>line</b> between Poland and Lithuania on June 18, 1919.

These attacks coincided with {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Versailles on June 28, which eliminated any danger from Germany. Attempting to halt further hostilities, Marshal of France Ferdinand Foch proposed a new line, known as the Foch Line, on July 18, 1919.|$|E

5|$|Significant {{delays in}} {{finalising}} arrangements for Operation Trio {{were caused by}} disagreements regarding where it would commence, who would be in command, the involvement of Chetniks and NDH forces, {{how to deal with}} the <b>demarcation</b> <b>line</b> between the German and Italian zones of occupation, and what local authorities would be put in place as localities were cleared of insurgents. The NDH contributed to the mutual suspicion between the Germans and Italians. The Italian demands prevailed, because they were committing larger forces to the operation. The decision was ultimately made to target all insurgents in eastern Bosnia between Sarajevo and the Drina. Throughout the preparation for Operation Trio, the Italians looked for opportunities to cross over the <b>demarcation</b> <b>line</b> and expand their sphere of influence into eastern Bosnia to take advantage of German weakness in the NDH. Bader's final orders for the operation granted several key Italian demands, including military control over civil affairs in the area of operations, fair treatment of the local population, and treating non-resisting Chetniks as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was of limited effectiveness due to several factors, including preemptive {{action by the}} Ustaše militia and Italian delays. The area of operations straddled the <b>demarcation</b> <b>line</b> between the German and Italian zones of occupation within the NDH, which led to mutual suspicion and lack of coordination. Both insurgent factions avoided fighting the Axis and NDH forces, instead focusing on fighting each other. After Operation Trio, the Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito, his Supreme Headquarters and the Partisan main force, consisting of the 1st and 2nd Proletarian Brigades, withdrew from their base of operations around Foča. After briefly reorganising around Zelengora mountain south-east of Foča, they moved their operations to western Bosnia {{for the remainder of}} 1942.|$|E

This perpendicular road is the present-day Middle Road. Due to increasing Chinese immigrants settling near the European Town, the Europeans subsequently vacated the area to dwell more inland, away from the urbanising city quarters.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1971, {{there were}} rising {{tensions}} between India and Pakistan, and after Pakistan declared a national emergency on 23 November, the Indian Navy deployed three s {{in the vicinity of}} Okha, near Karachi, to carry out patrols. As the Pakistani fleet would also be operating in the same waters, the Indian Navy set a <b>demarcation</b> <b>line</b> which ships in their fleet would not cross. Later this deployment proved to be useful for gaining experience in the region's waters. On 3 December, after Pakistan attacked Indian airfields along the border, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 officially began.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from the League of Nations, Poland agreed to negotiate, hoping to buy time and divert attention from the upcoming Żeligowski's Mutiny. The Lithuanians sought to achieve as much protection for Vilnius as possible. The agreement resulted in a ceasefire and established a <b>demarcation</b> <b>line</b> running through the disputed Suwałki Region up to the Bastuny railway station. The line was incomplete and did not provide adequate protection to Vilnius. Although neither Vilnius or the surrounding region was explicitly addressed in the agreement, numerous historians have described the agreement as allotting Vilnius to Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|Bader {{was named}} {{tactical}} {{commander of the}} combined forces (known as Kampfgruppe Bader) committed to Operation Trio, but to appease the Italians the force was formally under the overall command of the Italian Second Army, commanded by Roatta. Kampfgruppe Bader consisted of the 718th Infantry Division (the only German division stationed in the NDH at the time), the Italian 22nd Infantry Division, 1st Alpine Division, 5th Alpine Division and 28 NDH battalions. Since 18 February, the 718th Infantry Division had been responsible for an area of operations bounded by the Sava and Bosna in the north, the Drina {{to the east and}} the German-Italian <b>demarcation</b> <b>line</b> to the south. Mainly because of lack of transport and firepower, the division had only conducted limited offensive operations against the Partisans between mid-February and mid-April.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the Allied decision to evacuate, the cabinet sent Koht to Luleå in Sweden to try to reinvigorate a previously rejected plan to create a <b>demarcation</b> <b>line</b> between the Germans and Norwegian in Northern Norway.

During a meeting with the Swedish minister of foreign affairs, Christian Günther, who was to act as a middle man with Germans in relation to the plan, Koht revealed that the Allies were about to evacuate Norway. Although Günther never revealed the evacuation plans to the Germans, Koht was heavily criticised for doing so by his colleagues upon his return to Norway.|$|E
5|$|On September 5, 1920, Polish Foreign Minister Eustachy Sapieha {{delivered}} a diplomatic {{note to the}} League of Nations asking it {{to intervene in the}} Polish–Lithuanian War. He claimed that Lithuania allowed free passage through its territory for Soviet troops and therefore violated its declared neutrality in the Polish–Soviet War. The next day Lithuania responded with a direct note to Poland in which Lithuanian Foreign Minister Juozas Purickis proposed to negotiate a <b>demarcation</b> <b>line</b> and other issues in Marijampolė. On September 8, during a planning meeting for what later was the Battle of the Niemen River, the Poles decided to maneuver through the Lithuanian territory {{to the rear of the}} Soviet Army. In an attempt to conceal the planned attack, Polish diplomats accepted the proposal to negotiate. The negotiations started on September 16 in Kalvarija, but collapsed just two days later.|$|E
5|$|On March 11, a {{day before}} Austria was annexed into Greater Germany {{following}} the Anschluss, Justas Lukoševičius, a Lithuanian border patrol, shot Stanisław Serafin, a Polish soldier, on the <b>demarcation</b> <b>line</b> {{in the village of}} Trasninkai near Merkinė. The exact circumstances are not clear as the obscure event was variously portrayed as a Lithuanian provocation, a Polish provocation, or as an unfortunate accident. During the 1920s and 1930s, similar incidents had occurred: between 1927 and 1937 seven Lithuanian border guards were killed during the course of 78 events. Usually, such incidents were handled at the local level in an attempt to forestall escalation. On this occasion, however, Polish radio and newspapers picked up the story and fanned anti-Lithuanian sentiment. Protests were held in Warsaw, Vilnius, and four other cities where the crowds shouted for military action against Lithuania. There is evidence that the Camp of National Unity was involved in organizing the protests.|$|E

5|$|The League of Nations {{began its}} session on September 16, 1920.

A special Control Commission was to be dispatched into the conflict zone to oversee implementation of the resolution. The Lithuanian government accepted the resolution. Sapieha replied that Poland could not honor the Lithuanian neutrality or the <b>demarcation</b> <b>line</b> as Lithuania was actively collaborating with the Soviets. The Poles reserved the right of full freedom of action. The Lithuanian representative in London, Count Alfredas Tiškevičius, informed the secretariat of the League of Nations that Sapieha's telegram {{should be regarded as}} a declaration of war; he also asked that the League of Nations take immediate intervention in order to stop new Polish aggressive acts.|$|E
5|$|On 18 April, Bader {{informed}} Roatta of {{the need}} to take action immediately to relieve the besieged Croatian garrison at Rogatica, and by 20 April was advising his superiors that the joint German-Italian operation had miscarried due to Italian inaction. In the wake of Francetić's offensive, the Germans pre-emptively moved to clear the area north of the <b>demarcation</b> <b>line</b> before the formal start of the operation. This advance towards the Drina from 20–30 April, coordinated with NDH forces, was the first phase of Operation Trio (Trio I). The 718th Infantry Division advanced from assembly areas in Sarajevo, Olovo and Tuzla, with the aim of relieving Rogatica and clearing the surrounding area of Partisans. The fighting became very confused, with the Chetniks, who were under attack from the Black Legion, avoiding the German units, who went past them to attack the Partisans. The Partisan main force avoided fighting the Black Legion, instead attacking the Chetniks from the rear while they were engaged against Francetić's troops. The Italian 5th Alpine Division Pusteria utilised Chetnik troops from the Sandžak as auxiliaries during their advance on Čajniče which coincided with the German-NDH advance towards the Drina. Rogatica was relieved without fighting on 27 April, and the combined force reached the Drina three days later.|$|E

30|$|To {{draw the}} lines between “acceptable” (green area), “tolerable” (amber area), and “intolerable” (red area) {{is one of the}} most {{controversial}} tasks in the risk governance process. The UK Health and Safety Executive developed a procedure for chemical risks based on risk–risk comparisons (Löfstedt 1997). Some Swiss cantons, such as Basle County, experimented with round tables as a means to reach consensus on drawing the two <b>demarcation</b> <b>lines,</b> whereby participants in the round table represented industry, administrators, county officials, environmentalists, and neighborhood groups. The round table was facilitated by a professional mediator whose task was to reach a consensus between the various groups. Such a consensus was difficult to achieve, but in the end all the parties agreed with a solution by which the <b>demarcation</b> <b>lines</b> were only determined for a limited time with the clear understanding that the standards would be tightened if more risk reduction measures became available and were further developed (Keller 2000).|$|R
40|$|The {{plasma sheet}} is {{a region of}} hot (key) plasma {{extending}} several earth radii {{on either side of}} the neutral sheet in the geomagnetic tail. Its existence as a permanent feature of the magnetosphere has been well established observationally but has not been understood theoretically. A model is presented here that accounts qualitatively for both the origin and the dynamics of the plasma sheet. While several quantitative details remain to be worked out, the model can account for most of the observed features and behavior of the plasma sheet. The source of plasma-sheet particles in this model is the post-shock solar wind which injects particles into the magnetosphere principally through the <b>demarcation</b> <b>lines</b> on the magnetopause that separate closed (low-latitude) field lines from open (polar-cap) field lines. The particles drift longitudinally in pseudotrapped orbits and the higher-energy particles reach open field lines on the nightside and diffuse down the tail, forming the plasma sheet. The latitude of the <b>demarcation</b> <b>lines</b> determines the sharp high-latitude boundary of the plasma sheet, and the energy-dependent longitudinal drift accounts qualitatively for the energy spectrum of plasmasheet particles. The plasma-sheet particles escape downstream from the earth at a rate that is probably controlled by wave-particle scattering in the tail magnetic field, and drift into the neutral sheet at a rate controlled by the local cross-tail electric field. The plasma-sheet number density is governed by the balance between downstream loss and entry at the <b>demarcation</b> <b>lines.</b> When the loss rate exceeds the input rate, the resultant depletion of the near-earth plasma sheet may account for the enhanced rate of neutral-sheet merging responsible for the onset of magnetospheric substorms...|$|R
