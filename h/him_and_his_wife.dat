5|$|During an autopsy, {{the agents}} {{discover}} that the baby suffocated by inhaling dirt—meaning it was buried alive. Scully suggests that the baby's defects could {{have been caused by}} inbreeding. Mulder insists this would be impossible, since the Peacocks seem to live in an all-male household. Suspecting that the Peacocks have kidnapped and raped a woman, Mulder and Scully investigate their now-abandoned residence and discover blood, scissors, and a shovel on a table. Arrest warrants are issued for the three brothers. In retaliation, the Peacocks break into Sheriff Taylor's house during the night and murder <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lucas v. Earl is {{a leading}} case {{in the area of}} U.S. income taxation, and stands for the Anticipatory Assignment of Income Doctrine. In the case, Mr. Earl was arguing that because he and his wife, in the year 1901, had made a legally valid {{assignment}} agreement (for state law purposes) to have his then-current and after-acquired income (which was earned solely by him) be treated as the income of both <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> as joint tenants with right of survivorship, the assignment agreement should also determine the federal income tax effect of the income he earned (i.e., only half the income should be taxed to him).|$|E

He delivered food on Thanksgiving for the Chris Zorich Foundation; conducted self-esteem workshops for an anti-drug, anti-gang organization; participated in the Wolves' Read to Succeed program, in which he read to children at local libraries; and several others. In a 1997 interview, Breslin said that the most special charity he helped was one started by <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife.</b> The Extra Effort program was started at Indian Trail Junior High School in Addison, where Jami was a teacher.

When the floods damaged the Charles Bridge in Prague in 1890, Hlávka pushed through and co-funded its renovation in the original Gothic style. Moreover, he founded the student dormitory in Jenštejnská Street, Prague and donated it for gifted but poor students. In 1904 Hlávka gave all his fortune to the foundation, named after <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wives</b> Nadání Josefa, Marie a Zdenky Hlávkových ("Foundation of Josef, Marie and Zdeňka Hlávka"); this foundation is the oldest continuously operating Czech institution of its kind.|$|R
5|$|During {{the letters}} scandal, Charlotte lost her diary which {{contained}} both family secrets and critical thoughts on {{various members of}} her family; the diary was eventually given to Wilhelm, who never forgave her for its contents. Bernhard was transferred to a regiment in the quiet town of Breslau, effectively exiling <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife.</b> As controller of Charlotte's allowance, Wilhelm also limited their ability to travel outside of the country unless {{they were willing to}} go without royal honours. In 1896, Dona accused Charlotte of engaging in an affair with Karl-August Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, a court official. Charlotte fiercely denied the allegations. Bernhard defended his wife and criticised the Hohenzollerns for attempting to keep every Prussian princess {{under the control of the}} family. Bernhard considered resigning his army position and leaving with his wife for Meiningen, though the dispute eventually resolved itself when von Diersburg returned to court with his wife. The scandal was considered to have seriously damaged the reputation of the monarchy.|$|E

Leane lived in Adelaide until his death at the Repatriation General Hospital, Daw Park on 25 June 1962, with <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> celebrating their diamond wedding anniversary two weeks before his death. He was buried in Centennial Park Cemetery, and was survived by his wife, Edith, and six children: five sons and a daughter. His son Geoffrey was originally a mounted policeman then a detective, was a lieutenant colonel and twice mentioned in despatches during World War II, later became a police inspector, and was deputy commissioner from 1959 to 1972. His namesake son, known as Lionel, became a detective sergeant. Another son, Benjamin, was a warrant officer during World War II, and survived being a prisoner-of-war of the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The airship had tumultuous {{times at}} the start. Professor A. W. Bernard of Nashville, Tennessee took claim to his {{invention}} in 1897. Myers sent telegrams to editors of newspapers {{in the month of}} May of that year explaining that he was the inventor of the world's first 'sky-cycle' airship in spite of what Bernard and others said. Myers explained to the newspapers that his invention had already been displayed in front of a group of people in New York City in August 1895. Myers showed to them that the basic principles of the controllable airship were already patented by <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> on May 26, 1885. He further explained that the only 'sky-cycle' patent ever issued to anybody was granted to him on April 20, 1897. Bernard was trying to stake claim that it was his invention and had really just made a duplicate of Myers' previous recorded patents.|$|E

Shaftesbury wanted to end this arrangement and the marriage, so that he could marry his new girlfriend. While Shaftesbury was discussing his desire with <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> a fight broke out between <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife's</b> brother, Mohammed M'Barek.

5|$|The {{night after}} SummerSlam, Punk accused Nash of conspiring with Triple H to keep Punk {{away from the}} WWE Championship. After {{repeated}} confrontations, Nash and Punk demanded to face each other at Night of Champions, to which Triple H acquiesced. However, after Punk's repeated verbal attacks towards <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> Stephanie McMahon, Triple H booked himself to replace Nash. At Night of Champions, Punk lost a No Disqualification match after Nash, The Miz, and R-Truth attacked both men. Miz and Truth also attacked Punk at Hell in a Cell after he lost a WWE Championship triple threat match. He attempted to avenge this by teaming with Triple H against Miz and Truth at Vengeance, but lost again due to Nash attacking Triple H. This helped transition Punk's anti-establishment voice from Triple H to John Laurinaitis, who became the interim Raw general manager. Punk balked at Laurinaitis' promotion and verbally attacked him as a dull yes man.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} play in the Lancashire League in England during the Australian winter of 1952, joining Nelson Cricket Club for a sum of 600 pounds and bonuses, which did not include the boat fares for <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife.</b> Lindwall took 96 wickets at 8.37 during the season and developed an inswinger on the advice of a local umpire who adamantly refused to give leg before wicket decisions to outswingers. Lindwall returned to Australia with a newborn son who has been born during his stay in Lancashire, and he was greeted by media speculation as to whether his professional sojourn had improved or detracted from his capabilities. Lindwall's form leading into the Tests against South Africa in 1952–53 prompted observers to opine that he was bowling better than ever, reinforced with the inswinger and his trademark Yorker. Lindwall made 70 from a total of 148 on a sticky wicket against South Australia in Adelaide that led Miller to regard it as the best innings he had seen under such conditions. He made the score after being sent in to open the batting in the absence of Sid Barnes.|$|E
5|$|While {{talking about}} Chris's {{situation}} with Lois, Peter is suddenly {{confronted by the}} Giant Chicken. This is the third fight between the two. Their epic battle ranges from the Griffin house, through the sewers, onto a subway train, over the girders of a high-rise construction site, and then up into a biplane, crashing into a giant Ferris wheel, which is dislodged from its platform and rolls through the streets. The fight continues atop the rolling wheel until it demolishes a ten-story apartment building. Emerging from the wreckage, Peter and the Chicken realize that neither has any idea what they are fighting about. They apologize to each other, and the Chicken invites Peter to join <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> Nicole, for dinner. At the restaurant, the three have just finished a lovely meal when the check arrives, and both Peter and the Chicken (named Ernie) insists on paying the tab--Peter insists on paying since his order was kind of expensive while Ernie insists on paying {{as a way of}} apologizing to Peter. As they face off, the fight resumes and leads them into the restaurant kitchen. Peter subdues Ernie with a pot of boiling water and beats him unconscious. Peter staggers home, and back in the kitchen, Ernie lies lifeless on the floor, but in a sudden close-up, Ernie's left eye opens as dramatic music plays, foreshadowing another chicken fight. Peter goes home and resumes his conversation with Lois.|$|E

Of all the boy's {{parents and}} uncles, he's the one {{depicted}} in the most negative light, shown as greedy, completely uncaring of what his father or son want, and only concerned with his impending wedding.
