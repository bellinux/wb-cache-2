50|$|GSM-R, Global System for Mobile Communications - Railway or <b>GSM-Railway</b> is an {{international}} wireless communications standard for railway communication and applications.|$|E
50|$|The first {{commercial}} use was for Railways. For <b>GSM-Railway</b> {{this is one}} of the most important features. VGCS is important to compete with TETRA for Professional Mobile Radio (PMR). This service is location dependent and therefore different from the Push to talk service.|$|E
50|$|WINGcon is a German {{company that}} {{operates}} in the telecommunications industry. The company is specialized to design, develop and provide telecom products and solutions {{as well as}} consulting services worldwide with focus on <b>GSM-Railway.</b> Nowadays WINGcon holds a distinguished position in the European GSM-R market. WINGcon's communication products and solutions include Blackbox Recording Centers (voice recording), Short Message Service Centers, SMS gateways, location-based services, as well as billing mediation devices.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, the SRO {{contracted}} {{a consortium}} {{made up of}} Siemens Transportation Systems and the Saudi Arabian Nour Communications Company to modernize both the Dammam-Riyadh Line and the cargo line of SRO rail network. The line will be equipped with signalling technology including an electronic interlocking as core of the installation and Trainguard 100 for ETCS Level 1. <b>GSM-Railway</b> (GSM-R) mobile radio technology {{will be used for}} communications on the entire rail network.|$|E
30|$|The paper puts {{forward a}} NDN {{high-speed}} <b>GSM-Railway</b> communication system (NDN-GSM-R). Two simulations {{are made to}} compare transmission interference time and end-to-end transmission delay service quality index with the packet data communication mode based on TCP/IP of GSM-R. The stimulation results show that NDN-GSM-R has better communication performance and can better meet the data communication demands for the future high-speed train running.|$|E
40|$|<b>GSM-Railway</b> is {{the ground}} to train radio {{communication}} system currently under deployment along the European railway infrastructure. 150. 000 km of railway track are foreseen to be covered in Europe in the coming years. The system is designed to ensure different communication services between ground and trains and is replacing progressively various old analogue radio equipment. It {{is one of the}} components of the “Euroradio” system, managing voice and signalling data. As a component of a critical infrastructure, GSM-R is a potential target for intentional electromagnetic interference. Indeed, malicious attacks can generate and propagate electromagnetic energy into the GSM-R frequency bands with the objective to impact the whole railway system. This paper presents a methodology based on the error vector magnitude parameter enabling to detect the presence of jamming signals at the receiver. This early detection can then be used by the railway system to appropriately react...|$|E
