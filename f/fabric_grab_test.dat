The two adults, {{dressed as}} lab assistants, crank handles {{as fast as}} they can to make it harder for the {{children}} to <b>grab</b> <b>test</b> tubes filled with blue, yellow, and red gunge. The children must still grab the tubes, make their way through the obstacle course that resembles an atom, and fill any gunge left into the correct tube to mix two colours together to make a new colour (purple, orange, or green). To help the children, a chart is placed above the course to show what two primary colours mix to make the correct secondary colour. Each correct mixing is worth 20 points, and the first child to mix all three colours together correctly (and earn 60 points) opens a vat which releases blue or yellow gunge on the matching adult.|$|R

40|$|Weed {{control and}} soil {{fertility}} are the two-main issues of organic production systems, especially in vegetable systems which {{are characterized by}} intensive soil tillage and irrigation, often using plastic mulches. Agroecological service crops (ASC) rolled with a roller-crimper seems a promising and more sustainable technique to cope with these issues. However, this technique is not well known and more research is needed. Thus, the GRAB in Avignon started a field experimentation in 2014, within the European SoilVeg project, to test different ASC mixtures combined with different termination techniques. This master thesis was done {{during the last year}} of the experiment, addressing the problematic: “Is rolled winter agroecological service crop technology combined with strip tillage a good alternative to conventional tillage for organic outdoor organic vegetable production for weed control and soil fertility improvement? The field experiment based at <b>GRAB</b> <b>tested</b> two ASC mixtures (1 : rye+pea and 2 : barley+fababean+pea) and two ASC termination strategies (mow and incorporate ASC with soil tillage (GM) and roll ASC (RC)) effect on butternut squash agronomical performances. The experimental design was a complete block design with two blocks. 18 parameters were measured that were fit into five categories: agronomical performances, weed control, soil quality and fertility, environment and economical profitability. The rolling technique to properly terminate an ASC is feasible, even in organic farming conditions without any herbicide. RC technique was a good alternative compared to conventional management systems (GM or no ASC) for weed control. However, it did not improve soil structure and quality on the short term. Soil was more compacted with a lower porosity than tilled soils. Squash roots were shallower on RC modalities. Squash agronomical performances were lower on RC modalities (yield was 21. 7 Mg ha- 1 for RC 2 versus 34. 7 Mg ha- 1 for GM 2), impacting strongly the economic performance which was also lower. Thus, the technique of rolled winter ASC did not appear as a good alternative to conventional systems with the agronomical choices made (ASC choice, crop fertilisation, weeding management, etc.) within pedoclimatic conditions of the experiment on short term. Redoing this research without soil tillage on a long-term experiment (> 4 years) would be interesting to study if the soil quality and fertility improve with RC management...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{from cold}} regions in North America {{has shown that}} the {{performance}} of stormwater ponds differs between winter and summer. The pond hydraulics change seasonally, and winters have lowered removal efficiency due to a combination of an ice cover, cold water and de-icing salts. This study examines the function of the Backaslov stormwater pond under the more mild conditions of southern Sweden, where there are several snow and melt cycles per year. Event sampling in the summer of 1997 showed good removal efficiencies for nutrients, total suspended solids (TSS) and a selection of metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn), but winter grab-tests taken in 1995 - 96 and 1997 - 98 suggest that the pond acts as a pollutant source under cold conditions. To better assess winter and spring pond performance, water at the inflow and outflow was sampled from January to April 2003. The low intensity of runoff delivery and slow inflow velocities meant that time- rather than flow-weighted sampling was used. Five consecutive events were sampled and analysed for TSS, chloride and the metals As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn. YSI probes were in place at both the inlet (pH, temperature) and outlet (pH, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen) to determine the timing of pollution flows. In addition, profiles of the same quality indicators allowed snapshots of pond processes. De-icing salt has a major effect on pond hydraulics. Strong stratification occurred after each snowmelt-generated flow event and up to 80 % of chloride could be retained by the pond. However, continuous conductivity measurements show that chloride is flushed between events. Ice changes retention times and causes oxygen depletion, but bed scour was not observed. Pond performance decreased during the winter and spring, albeit not as badly as the <b>grab</b> <b>tests</b> suggest. A seasonal comparison of the removal efficiencies showed that removal of Cd (75 %) and Cu (49 %) was about the same for summer and winter-spring, but removal of Pb, Zn and TSS dropped from 79 %, 81 % and 80 % to 42 %, 48 % and 49 % respectively. The removal efficiencies for the other metals sampled in 2003 were: As, 50 %; Cr, 39 %; Hg, 56 %; Ni, 41 %...|$|R

40|$|Automated storage systems often rely on {{that the}} {{positions}} of the pallets are known with high precision. In this thesis, a turnable camera mounted on the robot has been used for handling the situation of approximately known pallet positions. The robot is given the approximate location of a pallet, and its objective is to locate the pallet with a precision that is high {{enough to be able to}} approach it from the correct direction and then lift it. For this, a precision of a few centimetres in each direction is needed. A system for locating the pallet from single images, based on rotational symmetry filters, has been developed, and a simple program for controlling the robot has been implemented. These could very well be extended and improved, e. g. by considering multiple images and improving the path planning. The main part of the thesis deals with the image processing part.

40|$|In {{at least}} 45 low- and middle-income countries, piped water systems deliver water for limited durations. Few data are {{available}} {{of the impact of}} intermittent water supply (IWS) on the water quality and quantity delivered to households. This thesis examines the impact of intermittently supplied piped water on {{the quality and quantity of}} water delivered to residential taps in Hubli-Dharwad, India, when compared to continuous piped water supply. A framework for understanding the pathways through which IWS can impact water quality is first developed. The extent to which contamination occurs in Hubli-Dharwad is quantified by comparing microbial water quality throughout the distribution system in an intermittent system and a continuous system in the same city. The mechanisms affecting water quality in the IWS network in Hubli-Dharwad are identified by measuring changes in water quality over time using continuous measurements from pressure and physico-chemical sensors paired with <b>grab</b> samples <b>tested</b> for indicator bacteria. In the final chapter, a new method of measuring household water consumption in an IWS when supply durations are limited and few metered {{data are available}} is developed. This thesis showed that the intermittent supply was frequently subject to contamination in the distribution system and that households with intermittent supply consumed limited quantities of water. While these results demonstrated that converting to a continuous water supply can improve water quality when compared to intermittent supply, this conversion may not be possible in the near future for resource-constrained towns and cities. This thesis contributes to knowledge of the mechanisms causing contamination and constricting water access in IWS systems, which can help improve systems to ensure that people with piped water receive water that is reliable, safe, and sufficient...|$|R

These tasks have been granted a continuation from the 1997 work and will all end in June 1998. This report represents the last technical quarterly report deliverable for the WVU Cooperative Agreement - Decontamination Systems Information and Research Program. Final reports for all of the 1997 projects will be submitted afterwards as one document. During this period, groundwater extraction operations were completed on Task 1. 6 - Pilot Scale Demonstration of TCE Flushing Through PVDs at the DOE/RMI Extrusion Plant. The data have been evaluated and graphs are presented. The plot of TCE Concentration versus Time shows that the up-gradient groundwater monitoring well produced consistent levels of TCE contamination. A similar trend was observed for the down-gradient wells via <b>grab</b> samples <b>tested.</b> Groundwater samples from the PVD test pad Zone of Influence showed consistent reductions in TCE concentrations with respect to time. In addition, a natural pulse frequency is evident which will {{have a significant impact on}} the efficiency of the contaminant removal under natural groundwater advection/diffusion processes. The relationships between the PVD Extraction Flow Rate versus Cumulative Time shows a clear trend in flow rate. Consistent values between 20 to 30 g. p. m. at the beginning of the extraction duration, to less than 10 g. p. m. by the end of the extraction cycle are observed. As evidenced by the aquifer�s diminishing recharge levels, the PVD extraction is affecting the response of the aquifer�s natural attenuation capability.

40|$|The {{carpal tunnel}} {{syndrome}} (CTS) {{is the most common}} nerve compression syndrome of the upper limb. CTS is caused by repeated and long-term owerloading specific muscles group with successive compression of medianus nerve located in the wrist area also known as carpal tunnel. The lower part consists of 8 wrist bones covered by ligamentum transversum carpi. The tunnel makes a passage for other structures such as vessels and tendons, all of which being swelled can cause the CTS. CTS is more prevalent among females than among males with ratio 4 to 1. The number of patients suffering from the syndrome is growing higher even with advanced medical science and improved care for patients (Bitnar aj., 2009; Ehler, 2005; Mlčoch, 2008). CTS can affect anyone and the chance to suffer from this condition is around 10 % for each individual (Mrzena 2006). The world wide patients' number increase is 0. 1 % (Katna 2006) and the net prevalence among population is within 2. 7 - 3 % (Mlčoch, 2008). In the USA, around 260, 000 patients indicated with the CTS are operated. The compression of the nerve causes increasing pain and paresthesia. The first symptoms are recorded during night usually passing away with stroking of the hand and hand exercises. During later stages of CTS, the patients suffer from the pain even during day. After being examined by a neurologist, the patients are recommended to undergo a chirurgical treatment which is based on cutting of the ligamentum transversum carpi. The good recovery is ensured by immediate rehabilitation. One year after the chirurgical treatment, the patients are expected to regain full hand abilities. Contrary to the expectations, one patient out of four is not able to regain these abilities. A question arises, are the contemporary exercises of limbs upper acra, which are mainly used for rehabilitation of the patients, effective enough? Is it possible to incorporate these exercises into more complex recovery, implement knowledge of the science of neurophysiology and focus the exercises on the root joint to develop more effective recovery? This thesis integrates theory and empirical findings related with the CTS. The general literature part is focused on relevant anatomy, kinesiology, functional ontogenetic of the upper limb, ways to diagnose and therapy of CTS. The experimental sections of the thesis intents to develop and apply recovery treatment concentrated on the neurophysiology of managing movements from root joint and incorporate these treatments into the standard CTS recovery exercises. Furthermore, a short after CTS operation recovery program will be created and conducted. A set of exercises was developed to activation and strengthening of the glenohumeral joint so the effects would be made means of reflexes path to the acrum and also to the more distant stages of stabilizing system. Developed exercises were applied on two probands diagnosed with CTS. Probands participated on six sessions, during which they were treated with manual therapy of the wrist area and hand. Moreover, probands were informed and instructed how to conduct specific exercises of the glenohumeral joint. Afterwards, set of exercises were performed by probands {{at least once a week}} with duration of five to ten minutes. A part longer sessions, were devoted to supervision and correction of exercise program to increase effectively of the treatment. The kinesiological analysis was performed on the probands in the beginning and also in the end. The visual analog scale was utilized as subjective evaluation of therapy effectives. Objective evaluation was measured by staple test, goniometric <b>test</b> and <b>grab</b> <b>test</b> by Novak. The both of probands were fully recovered. Disappearance of the pain and improvement of general motion ability by operated limb were observed. Based on subjective as well objective test, the success of the therapy was proven...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to compare the kinematic variables in youth swimmers during the grab start between sexes and to investigate the relationship between body composition and kinematic variables of the participants. Six female (Mage = 13. 71 ± 0. 49 yrs) and seven male (Mage = 14. 00 ± 1. 07 yrs) swimmers participated in this study. All participants were required to perform <b>grab</b> start <b>tests</b> in random order (three trials by each participant), while the best attempt was analyzed. Nineteen kinematic parameters consisting of block time, flight time, flight distance, total time, total distance, horizontal and vertical displacement of the center of mass (CM) at take-off, horizontal and vertical displacement of the CM at entry, height of take-off and entry, relative height of take-off, horizontal and vertical velocity of the CM at take-off, horizontal and vertical velocity of the CM at entry, angle of take-off, angle of entry and angle of knee at block were analyzed. Out of the 19 evaluated kinematic parameters, a statistical difference between the female and male group was found only in the total distance. Therefore, both female and male groups are considered as only one group and merged after analyzing the results. Statistical analysis showed positive and negative correlations between horizontal / vertical velocity of CM at take-off and several kinematic variables (e. g. angle of entry (rhorizontal = -. 868, p=. 000 / rvertical =. 591, p=. 02), total distance (rhorizontal =. 594, p=. 02 / rvertical =. 54, p=. 04), and height of take-off (rvertical =. 888, p=. 000), respectively). On the other hand, positive and negative correlations were found between somatotype components and several kinematic variables (e. g. horizontal displacement of CM at entry (rendomorphy = -. 626, p=. 013), angle of entry (rmesomorphy = -. 686, p=. 005 / rectomorphy =. 52, p=. 047), total distance (rendomorphy = -. 626, p=. 012), and height of take-off (rendomorphy = -. 633, p=. 011 / rectomorphy =. 515, p=. 05)). In conclusion, results show that in order to be successful at grab start performance, a swimmer should target to get higher horizontal velocity of CM at take-off and optimize the angle of take-off so this movement form supplies more total distance to the swimmer. Coaches should consider improving start performance and adding start training to regular training sessions. Moreover, youth male and female swimmers can participate together in the grab start trainin...|$|R

40|$|Replicate {{samples were}} {{collected}} with a 0. 1 m 3 van Vecn grab during high tide and by hand-digging during low tide on an intertidal sandflat. The volume of sediment in the grab samples was measured; the coefficient of variation from replicate series varied from 7. 4 to 20. 30 /o, with a mean for all stations of 13. 4 %. Digging characteristics of the grab were studied by SCUBA-divers under water, and by an experiment on a sandy beach. It was concluded that the jaws approached each other horizontally when closing rather than digging a semi-circular cut. The shock-wave of the grab appeared to be ncgligiblc for the infauna included in this study. Sample counts for the most abundant species obtained by digging and with the grab were compared. In only 8 out of 37 cases was there a significant diffcrcnce between {{the two sets of}} samples. The vertical distribution of the Iaulla in the substrate in terms of numbers and biomass was studied.

40|$|Background: The {{quality of}} {{stormwater}} runoff from ports is significant {{as it can}} be an important source of pollution to the marine environment. This is also a significant issue for the Port of Brisbane as it is located in an area of high environmental values. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an in-depth understanding of stormwater runoff quality to ensure that appropriate strategies are in place for quality improvement. [...] The Port currently has a network of stormwater sample collection points where event based samples together with <b>grab</b> samples are <b>tested</b> for a range of water quality parameters. Whilst this information provides a ‘snapshot’ of the pollutants being washed from the catchment/s, it does not allow for a quantifiable assessment of total contaminant loads being discharged to the waters of Moreton Bay. It also does not represent pollutant build-up and wash-off from the different land uses across a broader range of rainfall events which might be expected. As such, it is difficult to relate stormwater quality to different pollutant sources within the Port environment. [...] - Consequently, this would make the source tracking of pollutants to receiving waters extremely difficult and in turn the ability to implement appropriate mitigation measures. Also, without this detailed understanding, the efficacy of the various stormwater quality mitigation measures implemented cannot be determined with certainty. [...] - Current knowledge on port stormwater runoff quality Currently, little knowledge exists with regards to the pollutant generation capacity specific to port land uses as these do not necessarily compare well with conventional urban industrial or commercial land use due to the specific nature of port activities such as inter-modal operations and cargo management. Furthermore, traffic characteristics in a port area are different to a conventional urban area. Consequently, as data inputs based on an industrial and commercial land uses for modelling purposes is questionable. [...] A comprehensive review of published research failed to locate any investigations undertaken with regards to pollutant build-up and wash-off for port specific land uses. Furthermore, there is very limited information made available by various ports worldwide about the pollution generation potential of their facilities. Published work in this area has essentially focussed on the water quality or environmental values in the receiving waters such as the downstream bay or estuary. [...] - The Project: The research project is an outcome of the collaborative Partnership between the Port of Brisbane Corporation (POBC) and Queensland University of Technology (QUT). A key feature of this Partnership is the undertaking of ‘cutting edge’ research to strengthen the environmental custodianship of the Port area. This project aims to develop a port specific stormwater quality model to allow informed decision making in relation to stormwater quality improvement {{in the context of the}} increased growth of the Port. [...] - Stage 1 of the research project focussed on the assessment of pollutant build-up and wash-off using rainfall simulation from the current Port of Brisbane facilities with the longer-term objective of contributing to the development of ecological risk mitigation strategies for future expansion scenarios. Investigation of complex processes such as pollutant wash-off using naturally occurring rainfall events has inherent difficulties. These can be overcome using simulated rainfall for the investigations. [...] - The deliverables for Stage 1 included the following: * Pollutant build-up and wash-off profiles for six primary land uses within the Port of Brisbane to be used for water quality model development. * Recommendations with regards to future stormwater quality monitoring and pollution mitigation measures. The outcomes are expected to deliver the following benefits to the Port of Brisbane: * The availability of Port specific pollutant build-up and wash-off data will enable the implementation of customised stormwater pollution mitigation strategies. * The water quality data collected would form the baseline data for a Port specific water quality model for mitigation and predictive purposes. * To be at the cutting-edge in terms of water quality management and environmental best practice in the context of port infrastructure. [...] Conclusions: The important conclusions from the study are: * It confirmed that the Port environment is unique in terms of pollutant characteristics and is not comparable to typical urban land uses. * For most pollutant types, the Port land uses exhibited lower pollutant concentrations when compared to typical urban land uses. * The pollutant characteristics varied across the different land uses and were not consistent in terms of the land use. Hence, the implementation of stereotypical structural water quality improvement devices could be of limited value. * The < 150 m particle size range was predominant in suspended solids for pollutant build-up as well as wash-off. Therefore, if suspended solids are targeted as the surrogate parameter for water quality improvement, this specific particle size range needs to be removed. [...] - Recommendations: Based on the study results the following preliminary recommendations are made: * Due to the appreciable variation in pollutant characteristics for different port land uses, any water quality monitoring stations should preferably be located such that source areas can be easily identified. * The study results having identified significant pollutants for the different land uses should enable the development of a more customised water quality monitoring and testing regime targeting the critical pollutants. * A ‘one size fits all’ approach may not be appropriate for the different port land uses due to the varying pollutant characteristics. As such, pollution mitigation will need to be specifically tailored to suit the specific land use. * Any structural measures implemented for pollution mitigation to be effective should have the capability to remove suspended solids of size < 150 m. * Based on the results presented and the particularly the fact that the Port land uses cannot be compared to conventional urban land uses in relation to pollutant generation, consideration should be given to the development of a port specific water quality model. ...|$|R
