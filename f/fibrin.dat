5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by <b>fibrin</b> deposition. Red blood cells and <b>fibrin</b> are the main components of venous thrombi, and the <b>fibrin</b> appears to attach to the blood vessel wall lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E
5|$|If blood patches alone do {{not succeed}} in closing the dural tears, {{placement}} of percutaneous <b>fibrin</b> glue {{can be used in}} place of blood patching, raising the effectiveness of forming a clot and arresting CSF leakage.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{coagulation}} is {{initiated by}} the release of tissue factor from damaged tissue. Tissue factor binds to circulating factor VIIa. The combination activates factor X to factor Xa and factor IX to factor IXa. Factor Xa (in the presence of factor V) activates prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin is a central enzyme in the coagulation process: it generates <b>fibrin</b> from fibrinogen, and activates {{a number of other}} enzymes and cofactors (factor XIII, factor XI, factor V and factor VIII, TAFI) that enhance the <b>fibrin</b> clot. The process is inhibited by TFPI (which inactivates the first step catalyzed by factor VIIa/tissue factor), antithrombin (which inactivates thrombin, factor IXa, Xa and XIa), protein C (which inhibits factors Va and VIIIa in the presence of protein S), and protein Z (which inhibits factor Xa).|$|E
5|$|Proteins were {{recognized}} as a distinct class of biological molecules {{in the eighteenth century}} by Antoine Fourcroy and others, distinguished by the molecules' ability to coagulate or flocculate under treatments with heat or acid. Noted examples at the time included albumin from egg whites, blood serum albumin, <b>fibrin,</b> and wheat gluten.|$|E
5|$|There are {{documented}} cases of reversible frontotemporal dementia and coma. Coma {{due to a}} CSF leak has been successfully treated by using blood patches and/or <b>fibrin</b> glue and placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position. Empty sella syndrome, a boney structure that surround the pituitary gland, occurs in CSF leak patients.|$|E
5|$|Any {{blood clot}} forms {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} between coagulation (the formation of the insoluble blood protein <b>fibrin)</b> and fibrinolysis. The three major mechanisms for such an imbalance are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal blood flow, injury to the blood vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are due to hypercoagulability.|$|E
5|$|D-dimers are a <b>fibrin</b> {{degradation}} product, and {{an elevated}} level {{can result from}} plasmin dissolving a clot—or other conditions. Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons. When individuals are at a high-probability of having DVT, diagnostic imaging is preferred to a D-dimer test. For those with a low or moderate probability of DVT, a D-dimer level might be obtained, which excludes a diagnosis if results are normal. An elevated level requires further investigation with diagnostic imaging to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|A {{spontaneous}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} leak {{is one of}} several types of cerebrospinal fluid leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A spontaneous CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches — headaches that worsen in a vertical position and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak). A CT scan can identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, an injection of the patient's own blood {{at the site of the}} leak, a <b>fibrin</b> glue injection or surgery. When the cause cannot be identified the set of symptoms is referred to as spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS).|$|E
25|$|Under homeostatic conditions, {{the body}} is {{maintained}} in a finely tuned balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis. The activation of the coagulation cascade yields thrombin that converts fibrinogen to fibrin; the stable <b>fibrin</b> clot being the final product of hemostasis. The fibrinolytic system then functions to break down fibrinogen and <b>fibrin.</b> Activation of the fibrinolytic system generates plasmin (in the presence of thrombin), {{which is responsible for}} the lysis of <b>fibrin</b> clots. The breakdown of fibrinogen and <b>fibrin</b> results in polypeptides called <b>fibrin</b> degradation products (FDPs) or <b>fibrin</b> split products (FSPs). In a state of homeostasis, the presence of plasmin is critical, as it is the central proteolytic enzyme of coagulation and is also necessary for the breakdown of clots, or fibrinolysis.|$|E
25|$|Plasmin is {{generated}} by proteolytic cleavage of plasminogen, a plasma protein synthesized in the liver. This cleavage is catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), which is synthesized and secreted by endothelium. Plasmin proteolytically cleaves <b>fibrin</b> into <b>fibrin</b> degradation products that inhibit excessive <b>fibrin</b> formation.|$|E
25|$|In {{inflammatory}} {{conditions in}} which <b>fibrin</b> is deposited in tissues, PAI-1 appears to {{play a significant role}} in the progression to fibrosis (pathological formation of connective tissue). Presumably, lower PAI levels would lead to less suppression of fibrinolysis and conversely a more rapid degradation of the <b>fibrin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Plasmin is a serine {{protease}} that acts to dissolve <b>fibrin</b> blood clots. Apart from fibrinolysis, plasmin proteolyses proteins in various other systems: It activates collagenases, some mediators of the complement system and weakens {{the wall of}} the Graafian follicle (leading to ovulation). It cleaves <b>fibrin,</b> fibronectin, thrombospondin, laminin, and von Willebrand factor. Plasmin, like trypsin, belongs to the family of {{serine protease}}s.|$|E
25|$|MCF is the {{greatest}} vertical amplitude of the trace. It reflects the absolute strength of the <b>fibrin</b> and platelet clot. A low MCF is indicative of decreased platelet number or function, decreased fibrinogen level or <b>fibrin</b> polymerization disorders, or low activity of factor XIII. A mechanically weak clot represents a severe bleeding risk and should initiate immediate therapeutic steps. High doses of heparin can lower MCF in the INTEM assay, but not in HEPTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM or APTEM (see under “reagents”).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to interacting with vWF and <b>fibrin,</b> platelets interact with thrombin, Factors X, Va, VIIa, XI, IX, and prothrombin to complete clot formation via the coagulation cascade.|$|E
25|$|Coagulation begins almost {{instantly}} after {{an injury to}} the blood vessel has damaged the endothelium lining the vessel. Leaking of blood through the endothelium initiates two processes: changes in platelets, and the exposure of subendothelial tissue factor to plasma Factor VII, which ultimately leads to <b>fibrin</b> formation. Platelets immediately form a plug {{at the site of}} injury; this is called primary hemostasis. Secondary hemostasis occurs simultaneously: Additional coagulation factors or clotting factors beyond Factor VII (listed below) respond in a complex cascade to form <b>fibrin</b> strands, which strengthen the platelet plug.|$|E
25|$|Several microangiopathic diseases, {{including}} {{disseminated intravascular coagulation}} and thrombotic microangiopathies, {{present with}} pathognomonic (diagnostic) red blood cell fragments called schistocytes. These pathologies generate <b>fibrin</b> strands that sever red blood cells {{as they try to}} move past a thrombus.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{adsorbent}} chemicals, such as zeolites, {{and other}} hemostatic agents {{are also used}} for sealing severe injuries quickly (such as in traumatic bleeding secondary to gunshot wounds). Thrombin and <b>fibrin</b> glue are used surgically to treat bleeding and to thrombose aneurysms.|$|E
25|$|Hyaluronidase (also {{known as}} {{spreading}} factor) breaks down hyaluronic acid and helps in spreading it. S. aureus also produces deoxyribonuclease, which {{breaks down the}} DNA, lipase to digest lipids, staphylokinase to dissolve <b>fibrin</b> and aid in spread, and beta-lactamase for drug resistance.|$|E
25|$|Phosphotungstic acid {{is used in}} {{histology}} as {{a component}} for staining of cell specimens, often together with haematoxylin as PTAH. It binds to <b>fibrin,</b> collagen, and fibres of connective tissues, and replaces the anions of dyes from these materials, selectively decoloring them.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} of coagulation in two pathways is mainly artificial, it originates from laboratory tests in which clotting times were measured after the clotting was initiated by glass (intrinsic pathway) or by thromboplastin (a mix of tissue factor and phospholipids). In fact thrombin is present {{from the very}} beginning, already when platelets are making the plug. Thrombin has a large array of functions, not only the conversion of fibrinogen to <b>fibrin,</b> the building block of a hemostatic plug. In addition, {{it is the most}} important platelet activator {{and on top of that}} it activates Factors VIII and V and their inhibitor protein C (in the presence of thrombomodulin), and it activates Factor XIII, which forms covalent bonds that crosslink the <b>fibrin</b> polymers that form from activated monomers.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory that}} {{thrombin}} {{is generated by}} the presence of tissue factor was consolidated by Paul Morawitz in 1905. At this stage, it was known that thrombokinase/thromboplastin (factor III) is released by damaged tissues, reacting with prothrombin (II), which, together with calcium (IV), forms thrombin, which converts fibrinogen into <b>fibrin</b> (I).|$|E
25|$|Intravascular {{fluorescence}} is a catheter-based {{medical imaging}} technique that uses fluorescence to detect high-risk features of atherosclerosis and unhealed vascular stent devices. Plaque autofluorescence {{has been used in}} a first-in-man study in coronary arteries in combination with optical coherence tomography. Molecular agents has been also used to detect specific features, such as stent <b>fibrin</b> accumulation and enzymatic activity related to artery inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before the}} {{inflammatory}} phase is initiated, the clotting cascade occurs {{in order to}} achieve hemostasis, or stop blood loss by way of a <b>fibrin</b> clot. Thereafter, various soluble factors (including chemokines and cytokines) are released to attract cells that phagocytise debris, bacteria, and damaged tissue, in addition to releasing signaling molecules that initiate the proliferative phase of wound healing.|$|E
25|$|In {{thrombotic}} thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), ADAMTS13 either is deficient or {{has been}} inhibited by antibodies directed at the enzyme. This leads to decreased breakdown of the ultra-large multimers of vWF and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with deposition of <b>fibrin</b> and platelets in small vessels, and capillary necrosis. In TTP, the organ most obviously affected is the brain; in HUS, the kidney.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, for {{differentiation}} on {{the species}} level, catalase (positive for all Staphylococcus species), coagulase (<b>fibrin</b> clot formation, positive for S. aureus), DNAse (zone of clearance on DNase agar), lipase (a yellow color and rancid odor smell), and phosphatase (a pink color) tests are all done. For staphylococcal food poisoning, phage typing {{can be performed}} {{to determine whether the}} staphylococci recovered from the food were the source of infection.|$|E
25|$|Hawkins et al.. {{demonstrated}} the toxic effects of CYN by mouse bioassay, using an extract {{of the original}} Palm Island strain. Acutely poisoned mice displayed anorexia, diarrhoea and gasping respiration. Autopsy results revealed haemorrhages in the lungs, livers, kidneys, small intestines and adrenal glands. Histopathology revealed dose-related necrosis of hepatocytes, lipid accumulation, and <b>fibrin</b> thrombi formation in blood vessels of the liver and lungs, along with varying epithelial cell necrosis {{in areas of the}} kidneys.|$|E
25|$|Excess {{circulating}} thrombin {{results from}} the excess activation of the coagulation cascade. The excess thrombin cleaves fibrinogen, which ultimately leaves behind multiple <b>fibrin</b> clots in the circulation. These excess clots trap platelets to become larger clots, which leads to microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis. This lodging of clots in the microcirculation, in the large vessels, and in the organs is what leads to the ischemia, impaired organ perfusion, and end-organ damage that occurs with DIC.|$|E
25|$|Normal {{platelets}} {{can respond}} to an abnormality on the vessel wall rather than to hemorrhage, resulting in inappropriate platelet adhesion/activation and thrombosis: {{the formation of a}} clot within an intact vessel. This type of thrombosis arises by mechanisms different than those of a normal clot: namely, extending the <b>fibrin</b> clot of venous thrombosis; extending an unstable or ruptured arterial plaque, causing arterial thrombosis; and microcirculatory thrombosis. An arterial thrombus may partially obstruct blood flow, causing downstream ischemia, or may completely obstruct it, causing downstream tissue death.|$|E
25|$|Damaged {{valves and}} endocardium {{contribute}} to the development of infective endocarditis. Specifically, the damaged part of a heart valve forms a local blood clot, a condition known as non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). The platelet and <b>fibrin</b> deposits that form as part of the blood clotting process allow bacteria to take hold and form vegetations. As previously mentioned, the body has no direct methods of combating valvular vegetations because the valves do not have a dedicated blood supply. This combination of damaged valves, bacterial growth, and lack of a strong immune response results in infective endocarditis.|$|E
25|$|The disease derives {{its name}} from {{deposits}} of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in a granular pattern in the mesangium (by immunofluorescence), a region of the renal glomerulus. The mesangium by light microscopy may be hypercellular and show increased deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. In terms of the renal manifestation of Henoch–Schönlein purpura, {{it has been found}} that although it shares the same histological spectrum as IgA nephropathy, a greater frequency of severe lesions such as glomerular necrosis and crescents were observed. Correspondingly, HSP nephritis has a higher frequency of glomerular staining for <b>fibrin</b> compared with IgAN, but with an otherwise similar immunofluorescence profile.|$|E
25|$|During surface {{colonization}} bacteria {{cells are}} able to communicate using quorum sensing (QS) products such as N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL). Once colonization has begun, the biofilm grows {{through a combination of}} cell division and recruitment. Polysaccharide matrices typically enclose bacterial biofilms. In addition to the polysaccharides, these matrices may also contain material from the surrounding environment, including but not limited to minerals, soil particles, and blood components, such as erythrocytes and <b>fibrin.</b> The final stage of biofilm formation is known as dispersion, and is the stage in which the biofilm is established and may only change in shape and size.|$|E
25|$|Some {{criticisms of}} the {{membrane}} theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations {{such as the ability}} of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties). Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined form, and that the protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and water. They demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and <b>fibrin</b> gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide has {{roles in}} both blood {{coagulation}} and anticoagulation. Sulfatide has anticoagulation activity when it binds to fibrinogen, which prevents fibrinogen from converting to <b>fibrin.</b> Sulfatide {{also has a}} direct inhibitory effect on thrombosis. On the other hand, sulfatide also helps to improve blood coagulation and thrombosis: first, sulfatide is believed to aid in thrombosis through its participation with coagulation factor XII; second, sulfatide binding to annexin V accelerates coagulation; third, sulfatide and P-selectin interactions expressed on platelets, help to ensure stable platelet adhesion and aggregation. However, most of these conclusions have been drawn using exogenous forms of sulfatide. Consequently, additional research and experimentation on endogenous sulfatide is necessary to fully understand the role of sulfatide in coagulation and thrombosis. Sulfatide is also present in serum lipoproteins, which {{are believed to be}} associated with the cause and development of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|Scaffolds {{may also}} be {{constructed}} from natural materials: in particular different derivatives of the extracellular matrix have been studied to evaluate their ability to support cell growth. Proteic materials, such as collagen or <b>fibrin,</b> and polysaccharidic materials, like chitosan or glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), have all proved suitable in terms of cell compatibility, but some issues with potential immunogenicity still remains. Among GAGs hyaluronic acid, possibly in combination with cross linking agents (e.g. glutaraldehyde, water-soluble carbodiimide, etc.), {{is one of the}} possible choices as scaffold material. Functionalized groups of scaffolds may be useful in the delivery of small molecules (drugs) to specific tissues. Another form of scaffold under investigation is decellularised tissue extracts whereby the remaining cellular remnants/extracellular matrices act as the scaffold. Recently a range of nanocomposites biomaterials are fabricated by incorporating nanomaterials within polymeric matrix to engineer bioactive scaffolds.|$|E
25|$|While {{traditional}} thromboelastography is {{a global}} assay for blood clotting disorders and drug effects, TEM is primarily used in combination with appropriate differential assays. They allow testing {{in the presence of}} therapeutic heparin concentrations and provide differential diagnostic information to support decisions in therapy. In numerous publications the validity of the method is shown. Application of TEM at the point of care (POC) or in emergency laboratories is getting more and more popular. TEM detects both hypo- and hyperfunctional stages of the clotting process and is probably the only reliable rapid test for the diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis. In contrast to standard clotting tests, the <b>fibrin</b> stabilizing effect of factor XIII contributes to the result. The rapid availability of results helps to discriminate surgical bleeding from a true haemostasis disorder and improves the therapy with blood products, factor concentrates, anticoagulants and protamine, hemostyptic and antifibrinolytic drugs. Several reports confirm that application of TEM is cost effective by reducing the consumption of blood products.|$|E
25|$|Adhesions, or {{scar tissue}} between various organs {{that are not}} {{normally}} attached within the abdomen, may occur whenever an abdominal surgery is performed. It is often seen secondary to reperfusion injury where there is ischemic bowel or after intestinal distention. This injury causes neutrophils {{to move into the}} serosa and mesothelium to be lost, which the body then attempts to repair using <b>fibrin</b> and collagen, leading to adhesion formation between adjacent tissues with either fibrinous or fibrous material. Adhesions may encourage a volvulus, as the attachment provides a pivot point, or force a tight turn between two adjacent loops that are now attached, leading to partial obstruction. For this reason, clinical signs vary from silent lesions to acute obstruction, encouraging future colics including intestinal obstruction or strangulation, and requiring further surgery and risk of adhesion. Generally, adhesions form within the first two months following surgery. Adhesions occur most commonly in horses with small intestinal disease (22% of all surgical colics), foals (17%), those requiring enterotomy or a resection and anastomosis, or those that develop septic peritonitis.|$|E
