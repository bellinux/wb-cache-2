Compared to others on welfare, drug abusers were less involved in <b>work</b> <b>activities,</b> and had more employment barriers. Employment barriers were found to be more predictive of welfare to <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> than drug abuse.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the structure of vocational interests as reflected in interest in ventories, with a view to examining whether vocational interests could be assessed in correspondence with the perception of <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> characteristics. Two types of questionnaires on vocational interests were administered to male and female college students. The first consisted of 30 items assessing the interests in <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> characteristics such as objects of activities and activity functions. The second consisted of 50 items assessing the interests in various. job groups. Replies were collected from 922 students. The principal component analysis of the replies from the respondents revealed eight factors as to <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> characteristics.

The configuration of these <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> characteristics factors in two-dimensional space was compatible with Prediger's two-dimensional map (with axes, people / things and data / ideas) for the female samples but not for the male samples.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{evaluate}} a method for measuring <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> and skill requirements of 160 occupations in eight countries, used in EurOccupations, an EU-FP 6 project. Additionally, it aims to explore how the internet can be used for measuring <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> and skill requirements. Design/methodology/approach - For the 160 occupations, <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> were described in approximately ten tasks. Occupational experts and jobholders were invited to rate these tasks and to indicate the skill requirements, using a multilingual web-survey. Experts were recruited through the networks of the project partners and jobholders through frequently visited websites in the eight countries. The effectiveness of the drafting of tasks descriptions, the recruitment of raters, and the measurement of skill requirements is evaluated. Findings - The project showed that tasks descriptions for a wide range of occupations and countries can be drafted relatively easy, using desk research. Conducting a web-survey with a routing for 160 occupations and eight countries is viable. Recruiting experts used more resources than recruiting jobholders using the internet. Measuring skill requirements would need much more resources due to major variations within and across countries. Research limitations/implications - The article addresses a number of areas that are potentially worthy of further empirical investigations for a Europe-wide library of occupational titles, <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> and skill requirements. Practical implications - The paper outlines the potential of a future method for a European library of <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> and skill requirements for occupational titles, thereby facilitating European industrial training efforts. Social implications - Insight in the <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> and skill requirements of occupations will facilitate labour mobility and related training across EU member states.
