40|$|Cellular {{therapy to}} induce islet {{regeneration}} {{is emerging as}} a novel treatment strategy for diabetes. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) -derived hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) isolated by high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (ALDHhi) reduce hyperglycemia after transplantation into streptozotocin (STZ) -treated NOD/SCID mice. However, UCB-derived ALDHhi cells are rare and <b>expansion</b> <b>without</b> the loss of regenerative function is required. We hypothesized that BMS 493, an inverse retinoic acid receptor agonist, will prevent HSPC differentiation of HSPC during expansion, generating more ALDHhi cells for therapy. ALDHhi cells expanded for 6 days with BMS 493 showed a 2. 70 -fold-increase in ALDHhi cells compared to untreated cells. Conditioned media from BMS 493 -treated cells also increased human ß-cell proliferation in vitro. However, intrapancreatic transplantation of BMS 493 -treated cells did not reduce hyperglycemia in STZ-treated NOD/SCID mice. Further characterization of HSPC <b>expansion</b> <b>without</b> differentiation is required for islet regenerative therapies...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this article is}} to give a {{framework}} for the problem of the universe <b>expansion</b> <b>without</b> using the classical spacetime with its Friedmann-Lematre-Robertson-Walker metric (FLRW metric) which can not lead to a universe with an accelerated <b>expansion</b> rate <b>without</b> supposing the existence of an unknown dark energy. The idea is based on a force, called the cohesion force, opposed to gravitation, which dilates the three dimensional surface we live on. In this framework, the cohesion force and gravitation govern the expansion, the gravity and the time flow of the three dimensional surface we live on. Three main results of the cohesion force are presented. The first one concerns the black holes, the second one Quantum Mechanics and the third the Big Bang...|$|R
