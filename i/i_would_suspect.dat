5000|$|Hastings cites {{a number}} of {{examples}} from Wilson's research. [...] Perhaps the most graphic example occurred during the [...] "Buster series" [...] of atomic tests on November 1 and 5, 1951, which were accompanied by so many reported green fireball sightings in states affected by fallout, that even the New York Times carried a story on November 9, [...] "Southwest's 7 Fireballs in 11 Days Called 'Without Parallel in History'." [...] Dr. LaPaz was widely quoted saying, [...] "There {{has never been a}} rate of meteorite fall in history that has been one-fifth as high as the present fall. If that rate should continue, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suspect</b> the phenonenom is not natural... they don't behave like ordinary meteorites at all." ...|$|E
5000|$|An American bioethicist {{and medical}} historian, Jacob M. Appel {{has argued that}} sex toys are a [...] "social good" [...] and that the devices, which {{he refers to as}} [...] "marital substitutes", play [...] "an {{important}} role in the emotional lives of millions of Americans". [...] Appel has written: [...] I cannot say whether more Alabama women own vibrators than own Bibles. If I were guessing, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suspect</b> that a majority derive more use out of the vibrators. Certainly more pleasure. Nor does there appear to be any remotely rational basis for keeping sex toys {{out of the hands of}} married adults, or single adults, or even children. Now that we are relatively confident that masturbation does not make little girls go blind, or cause palms to sprout hair, exposure to sex toys shouldn't harm them. On the list of items that I might not want children to be exposed to in stores—guns, matches, poisons, junk food—sex toys are way down the list.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his review}} in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called it [...] "a movie of fits and starts" [...] and added, [...] "because the fits are {{occasionally}} so lovely, and the starts somewhat more frequent than Fifth Avenue buses, I was eventually hypnotized {{into a state}} of benign though not-quite-abject permissiveness [...] [...] [...] The movie is quite ordinary and Broadway-bland in most of its contemporary sequences. Miss Streisand, as a 22-year-old New Yorker whose Yiddish intonations are so thick they sound like a speech defect, defines innocence by sitting with her knees knocked together and her feet spread far apart, a mannerism she may have picked up from Mary Pickford. Minnelli's camera also is hard-pressed to find interesting things to look at in the humdrum settings [...] [...] [...] {{and a lot of the}} time it just records exits and entrances, as if it all were taking place on a stage. However, the movie, Minnelli and Miss Streisand burst into life in the regression sequences, filmed at the Royal Pavilion at Brighton. Minnelli's love of décor transforms the movie into very real fantasy, and the star into a stunning looking and funny character who mouths her arch, pseudo-Terence Rattigan lines as if she were parodying Margaret Leighton. She is so fine, in fact, that if I didn't know she was not terribly good at lip-sync, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>suspect</b> someone else was reading her." ...|$|E

5000|$|William of Baskerville also {{displays}} behavioral characteristics {{similar to}} Sherlock Holmes'. William's novice, Adso of Melk, describes William thusly: [...] "His energy seemed inexhaustible when {{a burst of}} activity overwhelmed him. But {{from time to time}} ... he moved backwards in moments of inertia, and I watched him lie for hours on my pallet in my cell, uttering barely a few monosyllables, without contracting a single muscle of his face. On those occasions a vacant, absent expression appeared in his eyes, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>suspected</b> he was in the power of some vegetal substance capable of producing visions if the obvious temperance of his life had not led me to reject the thought".|$|R
5000|$|The {{score was}} {{generally}} well received by critics, with The Associated Press review saying, [...] "Kander’s melodies are effortless, pouring {{out in a}} variety of styles from cakewalk to folk ballad to comic ditty. Ebb died in 2004, but here his clear, precise and often quite funny lyrics have been finished by Kander, and the transitions are seamless." [...] McWhorter, however, disagreed, writing that [...] "the Scottsboro score isn’t even much. One of John Kander and Fred Ebb’s least celebrated scores, Steel Pier, is Porgy and Bess compared to this one. Time passes for show music writers: the Scottsboro score is perhaps analogous to Cole Porter’s Aladdin or Jule Styne’s The Red Shoes. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> barely <b>suspect</b> Kander and Ebb had written this score if not told." ...|$|R

5000|$|Notes From The Underground was {{discussed}} on the Today Programme by John Sutherland and Peter James on 17 December 2007. Sutherland agreed with James that 'everything {{in the paper}} is worth reading' but felt the newspaper was pitched too highly compared to other free newspapers. 'It might work, but I think the title is an allusion to the Dostoevsky book Notes from Underground which <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>would</b> probably go {{over the heads of}} most commuters.'

60|$|So Whitefoot the Wood Mouse rarely ventures {{more than}} a few feet from a hiding place and safety. At the tiniest sound he starts nervously and often darts back into hiding without waiting to find out if there really is any danger. If he waited to make sure he might wait too long, and it is better to be safe than sorry. If you and I had as many real frights in a year, not to mention false frights, as Whitefoot has in a day, we <b>would,</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> lose our minds. Certainly we would be the most unhappy people in all the Great World.|$|R
60|$|Thunderfoot the Bison, {{often called}} Buffalo, {{is not a}} {{handsome}} fellow, as you very well {{know if you have}} seen him or a picture of him. His head is carried low, very near the ground, and on his shoulders is a great hump. No, you wouldn't call him handsome. You would hardly call him good-looking even. In fact, you <b>would,</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> call him homely. Certainly there is nothing about him to suggest pride. Yet according to the story Digger the Badger once told Peter Rabbit, pride and nothing less was the cause of that big hump which makes Thunderfoot appear so clumsy and homely.|$|R
5000|$|Pilgrim Shadow {{also drew}} praise from critics during its 2013 run. Tessa Hart {{described}} the sequel as ‘a hilarious, unusual Sci-Fi excursion’ in her 4 star review for Remote Goat. Some reviewers {{called for the}} pairing {{to move on to}} television. Gareth Alexander said that ‘if on TV ... their pairing <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>would</b> be seen as one of the greats’ during his 4 star review for Views from the Gods, and Camden Fringe Voyeur described both plays as ‘mini-sitcoms’ that ‘could be as good as anything on BBC Three’. The play also drew many comparisons with classic British comedy sitcoms, such as Blackadder, Red Dwarf, Bottom and Black Books.|$|R
60|$|Half a {{year earlier}} I should have had no {{solution}} for his strange behaviour. But I had learnt enough of the world by now to perceive what maggot was stirring in that egg-shaped head. Yet I blushed for him, and for his foul and unworthy suspicions. As soon <b>would</b> <b>I</b> have <b>suspected</b> the painted Madonna from the brush of Raffaele Santi that I had seen over the high altar of the Church of San Sisto, as suspect the beautiful and noble-souled Giuliana of giving that old pedant cause for his uneasiness. Still, I conceived {{that this was the}} penalty that such a withered growth of humanity must pay for having presumed to marry a young wife.|$|R
5000|$|The play {{received}} several particularly unfavorable reviews. Clive Barnes, the critic for The New York Times, wrote, [...] "Unfortunately the only nice thing I {{can say about}} the play is that the press representative is {{a close friend of}} mine. This, I sadly recognize, is not a commendation of much universal appeal. ... Mr. Mason may have certain talents; on the evidence before me <b>I</b> <b>would</b> hardly have <b>suspected</b> that writing was one of them." [...] John Chapman of the New York Daily News was quoted as writing, [...] "If I were the author I'd throw it away and start a new play -- or contemplate not writing anything." [...] Jack Gaver, of United Press International, wrote, [...] "It consists of all-too-familiar Jewish humor routines, sexual innuendo of the most basic sort endlessly repeated and what probably is intended to be a friendly treatment of the white-black racial situation that is cheapened by the other ingredients." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{have enjoyed}} reading {{the work of}} each of these authors over the years, so it is a real {{pleasure}} to have this opportunity to contribute to the discussion of this collaboration. The geometry of LARS furnishes an elegant bridge between the Lasso and Stagewise regression, methods that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have <b>suspected</b> to be so related. Toward my own interests, LARS offers a rather different way to construct a regression model by gradually blending predictors rather than using a predictor all at once. I feel that the problem of “automatic feature generation ” (proposing predictors to consider in a model) is a current challenge in building regression models that can compete with those from computer science, and LARS suggests a new approach to this task. In the examples of Efron, Hastie, Johnstone and Tibshirani (EHJT) (particularly that summarized in their Figure 5), LARS produces models with smaller predictive error than the old workhorse, stepwise regression. Furthermore, as an added bonus, the code supplied by the authors runs faster for me than the step routine for stepwise regression supplie...|$|R
5000|$|The show {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Radio Times {{described it as}} [...] "fun family entertainment to drive away the January blues", adding the show, [...] "which sees couples team up, row and give The Stig a run for his money, is a winner", however Matt Baylis in the Daily Express said that [...] "the only viewers who could have stayed the course, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> <b>would</b> have been TV critics or people forced to watch it while being interrogated in secret CIA prisons". Michael Hogan of The Daily Telegraph noted that [...] "the longer the show went on, the more its faults became apparent" [...] and described the show as [...] "slow, repetitive and unevenly paced" [...] and feeling [...] "like an over-stretched segment on Top Gear, TFI Friday or a bushtucker trial". Christopher Stevens of the Daily Mail scathed [...] "The Getaway Car is the worst TV spin-off since Joey Tribbiani got his own series {{on the back of}} Friends".|$|R
5000|$|Sharp’s {{short story}} {{collection}} {{was followed by}} Lost in Jersey City (1993), a comic novel about a Louisiana widow, Ida Terhune, who flees north {{to raise a family}} on her own. Her destination, Walter Satterwait of The New York Times Book Review wrote, is the unlikely metropolis of Jersey City, “its air stinking of fish and sewage, its gamy streets potholed, its landlords wicked, its cops crooked, its politicians and judges warped by greed and corruption. Ms. Sharp exploits these wonderful possibilities, both comic and tragic, with skill, compassion and zest.” [...] The novel was recognized as a New York Times Book Review Notable Book. Lost in Jersey City portrays the American family against an exploration of deeper political issues forming the frayed fabric of American society. Chris Goodrich of the Los Angeles Times compared Sharp’s work to that of Louise Malle and Virginia Woolf, stating [...] "...Woolf, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> <b>would</b> have loved it -- and perhaps even been a little envious." ...|$|R
6000|$|To {{say that}} Deronda was romantic {{would be to}} {{misrepresent}} him; but under his calm and somewhat self-repressed exterior there was a fervor which made him easily find poetry and romance among the events of every-day life. And perhaps poetry and romance are as plentiful as ever in the world except for those phlegmatic natures who <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>would</b> in any age have regarded them as a dull form of erroneous thinking. They exist very easily {{in the same room}} with the microscope and even in railway carriages: what banishes them in the vacuum in gentlemen and lady passengers. How should all the apparatus of heaven and earth, from the farthest firmament to the tender bosom of the mother who nourished us, make poetry for a mind that had no movements of awe and tenderness, no sense of fellowship which thrills from the near to the distant, and back again from the distant to the near? ...|$|R

60|$|An ill-timed, or {{an extravagant}} commendation, would not pass upon you; {{but you would}} keep off such a dedicator at arms-end, and send him back with his encomiums to this lord, or that lady, who stood in need of such trifling merchandise. You see, my lord, what an awe you have upon me, when I dare not offer you that incense which would be {{acceptable}} to other patrons; but am forced to curb myself from ascribing to you those honours, which even an enemy could not deny you. Yet I must confess, I never practised that virtue of moderation (which is properly your character) with so much reluctancy as now: for it hinders me from being true to my own knowledge, in not witnessing your worth, and deprives me of the only means which I had left, to shew the world that true honour and uninterested respect which I have always paid you. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say somewhat, {{if it were possible}} which might distinguish that veneration I have for you, from the flatteries of those who adore your fortune. But the eminence of your condition, in this particular, is my unhappiness; for it renders whatever <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say <b>suspected.</b> Professions of service, submissions, and attendance, are the practice of all men to the great; and commonly they, who have the least sincerity, perform them best; as they, who are least engaged in love, have their tongues the freest to counterfeit a passion. For my own part, I never could shake off the rustic bashfulness which hangs upon my nature; but, valuing myself at as little as I am worth, have been afraid to render even the common duties of respect to those who are in power. The ceremonious visits, which are generally paid on such occasions, are not my talent. They may be real even in courtiers, but they appear with such a face of interest, that a modest man would think himself in danger of having his sincerity mistaken for his design. My congratulations keep their distance, and pass no farther than my heart. There it is that I have all the joy imaginable, when I see true worth rewarded, and virtue uppermost in the world.|$|R
60|$|Individually, I have no {{love for}} academies on the {{continental}} model, and still less {{for the system}} of decorating men of distinction in science, letters, or art, with orders and titles, or enriching them with sinecures.

The sole order of nobility which, in my judgment, becomes a philosopher, is that rank which he holds in the estimation of his fellow-workers, who are the only competent judges in such matters. Newton and Cuvier lowered themselves when the one accepted an idle knighthood, and the other became a baron of the empire. The great men who went to their graves as Michael Faraday and George Grote seem to me to have understood the dignity of knowledge better when they declined all such meretricious trappings.|$|R
