40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the concept of}} <b>impulse</b> <b>purchasing</b> behavior online basically. The phenomenon of <b>impulse</b> <b>purchasing</b> has been researched in consumer research {{as well as for}} example in psychology and economics since the 1950 s. A detailed review and analysis of the literature asserts that there are some unsolved issues regarding the state of knowledge on <b>impulse</b> <b>purchasing</b> behavior. Furthermore, nowadays consumers buy an increasing amount of purchases on the Internet. The current conceptualizations of <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase</b> behavior do not adequately capture <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase</b> behavior over the Internet. Today several researchers have claimed that the phenomenon of <b>impulse</b> <b>purchasing</b> should be examined also in the context of online shopping environment.

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{phenomenon}} of <b>impulse</b> <b>purchasing,</b> which accounts for a growing proportion of total retail spend. The study investigates whether males and females act differently in respect of <b>impulse</b> <b>purchasing.</b> <b>Impulse</b> <b>purchasing</b> has been previously investigated {{in a range of}} settings and across a range of product types. The retail setting selected here is the convenience store (c-store) sector because c-stores depend traditionally on top-up, distress and <b>impulse</b> <b>purchases.</b> The types of purchases made at convenience stores are generally smaller items. An objective of c-stores is to get customers to increase their spending on higher value items. C-stores have a core user group of 26 % of adults. Differences in purchasing behaviour between genders are explored in the paper. Literature on comparisons between male and female shopping behaviour is reviewed and related to findings on variations in shopping behaviour previously identified in the c-store sector. Within the above context, quantitative primary research was undertaken. 300 postal questionnaires (150 each to males and females) were carried out with consumers from a Scottish locality. Attitudes towards their local convenience store and their purchasing habits when shopping there were investigated. The majority of respondents were female (59. 8 %) aged 36 - 50 (26. 2 %). Males and females had similar rank orders for choice of c-store attributes, with satisfaction of impulse needs being ranked equally unimportant by both groups. Their expectations of c-stores were similar; however there were some differences in purchasing habits. Results indicated gender differences concerning purchasing behaviour within convenience stores, both for planned and unplanned purchases. The most significant variances were females having a higher level of agreement that <b>impulse</b> <b>purchasing</b> is related to trying new products and having a higher level of satisfaction with the majority of <b>impulse</b> <b>purchases.</b> Recommendations for c-store retailers are that the merchandising techniques used to stimulate <b>impulse</b> <b>purchases</b> may have to be reconsidered in relation to gender...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} element in retailing {{is the use of}} impulse purchases; generally small items that are bought by consumers {{on the spur of the}} moment. By some estimates, <b>impulse</b> <b>purchases</b> make up approximately 50 percent of all spending by consumers. While <b>impulse</b> <b>purchases</b> have been studied in the brick-and-mortar retail environment, they have not been researched in the online retail environment. With e-commerce growing rapidly and approaching $ 20 billion per year in the Canadian and US markets, this is an important unexplored area. Using real purchasing behaviour from visitors to the Reunion website of Huntsville High School in Ontario Canada, I explored factors that influence the likelihood of an <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase</b> in an online retail environment. Consistent with diminishing sensitivity (mental accounting and the psychophysics of pricing), the results indicate that the likelihood of a consumer <b>purchasing</b> the <b>impulse</b> item increases with the total amount spent on other items. The results also show that presenting the offer in a popup is a more effective location and presentation mode than embedding the offer into the checkout page and increases the likelihood of the consumer making an <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase.</b> In addition, the results confirm that providing a reason to purchase by linking a $ 1 donation for a charity to the impulse item increases the frequency of the <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase...</b>|$|R

40|$|Attention on {{impulsive}} {{buying behavior}} has been increased from both researchers and marketers, as the negative consumption experience resulting from this unplanned buying could harm the business severely {{in terms of}} brand building, reputation {{as well as a}} loss of customer. By reviewing previous literatures, we have identified that there is still little research about the post-consumer behavior of <b>impulse</b> <b>purchases,</b> namely on consumers’ regret triggered from what they have bought impulsively. The {{purpose of this study is}} to discover the triggers of buyer regret from <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase,</b> which is presented by the research question “What are the triggers of buyer regret from impulse purchases?” By conducting a quantitative research, we proposed a conceptual model of <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase</b> regret that consists of six hypotheses. The technical tool that we used to test the conceptual model is a SPSS extension called AMOS, whereas the analysis method uses the application of structural equation modeling. We collected our primary data (187 viable responses) via a questionnaire through convenience sampling. By testing all the data with AMOS, we received the following result: 5 hypotheses are accepted and 1 hypothesis is rejected. This result indicates that upwards counterfactual thinking (CFT) on forgone alternatives, a change in significance, and under consideration are positively related to <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase</b> regret; external stimuli and consumer susceptibility to interpersonal influence (CSII) have indirect influence on <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase</b> regret. By applying our theoretical background to analyze the result, we suggest that consumer’s rational buying thinking still plays an important role in post evaluation stage of <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase,</b> even though it disrupts the rational buying process in the beginning. Lastly, we believe that several parties could benefit from our research, they are marketing, academia as well as consumers. ...|$|R

The impact of various variables like discount offer, various scheme, promotional activities, retail store offer, display of product, behavior of sales person, popularity of product, influence of reference group, income level of customers and festival season, on consumer impulse buying behavior, have been analyzed. The study is based on the primary data collected with the help of structured questionnaire. Data analysis has been done using SPSS software. The statistical analysis method employed in this study is Factor Analysis. The final outcome of the study helps in understanding the factors that affect the <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase</b> or <b>impulse</b> buying behavior of the customers and also the stimuli that triggers impulse buying. Introduction: An <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase</b> or <b>impulse</b> buying is an unplanned or otherwise spontaneous <b>purchase.</b> <b>Impulse</b> items can be anything, a new product, samples or well-established products at surprising low prices. Parboteeah (2005) stated that <b>impulse</b> <b>purchasing</b> is unplanned, the result of an exposure to a stimulus, and is decided on-the-spot. Impulse buyers start browsing without having a purpose to procure a definite article or visiting certain store. As customers browse, they are exposed to the stimuli, which triggers customers’ urge to buy on impulse. When impulse consumers consider the aspiration to purchase, they construct a procure decision with no penetrating for data and information or appraising best possible alternatives. Then, customers may face positive or negative outcomes through the post-purchase assessment after the procure on impulse. In this progression, shoppers are prejudiced by inner and outside things that generate the <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase</b> behavio...|$|R

40|$|What is {{the role}} of touch in {{consumer}} behavior? Consumers are especially motivated to touch some products before buying them, and for some people, those high in "desire to touch", touching before buying is especially important. In addition, some situations encourage consumers to touch goods before purchasing them. How do these relate to <b>impulse</b> <b>purchases?</b> People high in their "desire to touch" are more likely to make <b>impulse</b> <b>purchases.</b> Point-of-purchase signs that encourage touching a product stimulate <b>impulse</b> <b>purchases</b> in consumers who notice the sign, whether they are high or low in "desire to touch. " High "desire to touch" are much more likely than other consumers to notice the sign. Signs that praise a product, but stress vision rather than touch, do nothing to increase <b>impulse</b> <b>purchases</b> by either type of shopper. These results grow out of a study of shopper in front of the peaches and nectarines in a supermarket produce department. The characterization of consumers as high or low "desire to touch" was based on a 2 page questionnaire administered to 340 shoppers who had already placed peaches or nectarines in their shopping carts. How and how much they touched the fruit was previously recorded, and matched up with the characterization based on the questionnaire as a way of validating the classifications.

Even {{though there is a}} huge business potential in f-commerce, the purchase behaviour in f-commerce is still not well-studied with only a few studies are related to impulse buying through f-commerce and yet the studies are not from a holistic and integrated point of view. The theoretical framework development of this study is based on Social Impact Theory, Theory of Web Usage and Trust Transference Theory. This study investigated the antecedents of trust motivation; the predictors of participation, browsing, f-commerce usage intensity; and their influence on urge to impulsively <b>purchase</b> and <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase</b> from the context of f-commerce. The effect of urgency towards urge to impulsively <b>purchase</b> and <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase</b> were also determined. All items in the questionnaire were adapted from past studies and have been rigorously tested during the pre-test and pilot test. Based on purposive sampling technique, 1000 f-commerce users from Klang Valley who have spending power was selected and their responses were analyzed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the trigger factors that compel the consumer to <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase</b> of new products in the grocery retail sector. A comprehensive review and analysis of the literature suggests that there are some unresolved issues regarding the state of knowledge on <b>impulse</b> <b>purchasing</b> behavior of new products. In addition, the current conceptualizations of <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase</b> behavior do not adequately capture <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase</b> behavior in the grocery retail environment. In today’s modem era, shopping has become a social and leisure activity, with grocery shopping deemed to be an enjoyable task by consumers, reducing the number of cognitively planned purchases made by consumers. Hedonic and pleasure driven shopping endeavors have led to a rapid increase in impulse buying, making it common place and socially acceptable amongst peers. Even though, most inpulse decisions are made when consumers are inside the supermarket, identifying the trigger factors of inpulse buying of new products has not been adequately explored. Previous research has identified price to be the main trigger factor of inpulse buying in the retail sector in general. The study is both descriptive and exploratory in nature. This research approach was employed to collect data on the grocery retail sector and consumers impulsive behaviour. The research techniques employed are questionnaires and focus groups. Questionnaires conducted both face to face and online with SuperValu consumers in the Northwest and West of Ireland. A small scale observation study was conducted by the researcher before questionnaires were distributed. In addition to this research, four focus groups with SuperValu consumers have been conducted for further insights and perceptions. The research findings demonstrate that inpulse buying cannot occur as a result of one main trigger factor, but it is a wide mixture o f both the internal and external factors that encourage and attract the consumer to <b>impulse</b> <b>purchase</b> while in store. Analysis of the information gathered, highlights the importance of in-store stimuli on inpulse buying of new products. Since, multiple interactions and associations are possible, the study implies that retailers should seek to design the in-store environment to maximize the inpact on its primary target segment to encourage inpulse buying habits on a continuous basis. i...|$|R
