25|$|Isabel granted land at Brewood to Roger de Meyland, {{bishop of}} Coventy and Lichfield. This dates her period of office as being {{at least partly}} {{contemporary}} with his episcopate, approximately 1258-95, although {{it is impossible to}} <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> preceded or succeeded Mabel.|$|E
25|$|Claire {{lives with}} Agnes and Tobias {{and appears to}} have no means of support except for them. Her main role in life {{seems to be to}} annoy and embarrass her sister. She is {{everything}} that Agnes dislikes. Claire makes the statement, after telling Tobias that he {{would be better off if}} he killed Agnes, Julia, and herself, that she will never <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> wants to live until Agnes is dead. With this statement, Albee makes it sound as if Claire holds Agnes up as a role model, a model that she has never been able to reach. And instead of trying to reach it, she has done everything to live her life in a diametrically opposed manner.|$|E

500|$|However, {{her biggest}} success that year was her final release, Karan Johar's directorial debut, the romance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. Co-starring Shah Rukh Khan, her cousin Rani Mukerji and Salman Khan, the film {{emerged as an}} all-time {{blockbuster}} in both India and overseas with a worldwide gross of [...] Kajol played Anjali Sharma, an unattractive fun-loving tomboy, who later transforms into a feminine and beautiful girl, and is secretly {{in love with her}} best friend, played by Shah Rukh Khan. A review carried by The Times of India wrote, [...] "Kajol is almost mesmeric as Anjali, the firebrand youngster who doesn't <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> should settle for best girl or basketball buddy. [...] Kajol with her baggy apparel, her bouncy bob cut and her boyish banter is absolutely riveting." [...] She eventually won her second Best Actress award at the 44th Filmfare Awards ceremony and first Zee Cine Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film. Filmfare included Kajol's work in both Dushman and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai in their listing of Indian cinema's [...] "80 Most Iconic performances".|$|E
500|$|The album sold {{a million}} copies in the United States, and five million worldwide. Taraborrelli felt that at that moment, riding on Madonna's coattails proved {{profitable}} for everyone involved, including Warner Bros. Records, which notched up big sales with a compilation soundtrack album that was basically a showcase for its marginal artists. But still they wanted to [...] "milk-in" [...] the success of Madonna, a view shared by Peter Guber and Jon Peters, executive producers of the film. Hence they felt a worldwide concert tour was the appropriate thing to do, since it would promote both the soundtrack and the film, as well as Madonna's successful third studio album True Blue, released the year before. As Madonna's first world tour, Who's That Girl ended up being a resounding success, although by its end, Madonna declared {{that she did not}} want to hear any of her songs again and she did not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> would ever write another one. [...] "I returned feeling so burned out and I was convinced that I wouldn't go near music for quite a while", she said.|$|E
2500|$|On the day {{set for the}} halizah, {{immediately}} after the morning service, when all the people {{are still in the}} synagogue, the three judges and their two assistants, who also act as witnesses, meet at the appointed place. The three judges sit on one bench, the two assistants on a bench placed beside it; the [...] "yabam" [...] (brother-in-law) and the yebamah stand between them. Before the ceremony, a public examination establishes the relationship of the parties and their maturity. If one is a minor, a deaf-mute, a mute, or mentally handicapped, or has a crooked or turned foot, the halizah cannot be performed. The court must also <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> is left-handed or whether he is left-footed, and must be convinced that more than ninety-one days have passed since the death of her husband (see Levirate marriage).|$|E

2500|$|Linguists later discerned that, in January 1971, Genie showed {{understanding}} of only her own name, {{the names of}} a few others, and about 15–20 words, and her active vocabulary at the time consisted of two phrases, [...] "stop it" [...] and [...] "no more". They could not {{determine the extent of}} her expressive or receptive vocabulary at any point before January 1971, and therefore did not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> had acquired any or all of these words during the preceding two months. After observing Genie for some time they concluded that she was not selectively mute, and tests found no physiological or psychological explanation for her lack of language. Because her existing medical records also contained no clear indications of mental disabilities researchers determined that, due to her extreme isolation and lack of exposure to language during childhood, she had not acquired a first language.|$|E
2500|$|Otello laments {{his fate}} (Dio! mi potevi scagliar tutti i mali / [...] "God, {{you could have}} thrown every evil at me" [...] ). When Iago calls out [...] "Cassio is here!" [...] Otello hides as Iago and Cassio enter. Cassio says {{he had hoped to}} see Desdemona here, for he wanted to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> had been {{successful}} with Otello (Iago, Cassio, Otello: Vieni; l'aula è deserta / [...] "Come, the hall is deserted"). Iago asks him to tell of his adventures with that woman. Cassio asks which woman, and, softly, so that Otello cannot hear, Iago says [...] "Bianca" [...] (the name of Cassio's actual lover). As Cassio laughs about his romantic adventures, Otello assumes he is speaking of Desdemona. In a conversation only partially heard, Cassio seems to be telling Iago that another woman, a secret admirer, left him a handkerchief as a token. At Iago's urging, Cassio produces it, whereupon Iago seizes it—for it is Desdemona's—and holds it out where he knows Otello can see it. He then returns it to Cassio and teases him, while in his hiding place Otello fumes (Iago, Cassio, Otello: Questa è una ragna dove il tuo cuor casca / [...] "This is a spiderweb in which your heart is caught").|$|E
2500|$|From {{tapes of}} Genie's {{first two months}} in the hospital, {{linguists}} discerned that by January 1971 she knew her own name, the words mother and father, the four color words red, blue, green, and brown, the words no and sorry, and a few miscellaneous nouns such as jewelry box, door, and bunny. She also appeared to understand negative commands, and accordingly could discern a warning using a negation, although whether she understood them {{in the context of}} sentences was unclear. There was speculation, though no conclusive evidence, that she understood the intonation to indicate a yes or no question and that she understood imperative mood sentences based on tone of voice, but she otherwise lacked any grammar. Her active vocabulary at that time appeared to consist of just two short phrases, [...] "stop it" [...] and [...] "no more". Some doctors thought she may have spontaneously said a few other words or negative commands, as her very few vocalizations were extremely difficult to understand, but there was no record of them and no one could remember what they might have been. Linguists could not determine the extent of her expressive or receptive vocabulary at any point before then, and therefore did not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> acquired any or all of this language during the preceding two months at the hospital.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young woman}} flushed {{up as if}} she had been caught doing {{something}} dishonest. Some other woman down the line called out: [...] "The mean thing!" [...] I never <b>knew</b> <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> meant the other lady or me.|$|R
