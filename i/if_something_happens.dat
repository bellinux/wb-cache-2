500|$|In 352BC, Athenian troops {{successfully}} opposed Philip at Thermopylae,* E. M. Burke, [...] "The Early Political Speeches of Demosthenes", 184 (note 92). but the Macedonian {{victory over}} the Phocians at the Battle of Crocus Field shook Demosthenes. In 351BC, Demosthenes felt strong enough to express his view concerning the most important foreign policy issue facing Athens at that time: the stance his city should take towards Philip. According to Jacqueline de Romilly, a French philologist {{and member of the}} Académie française, the threat of Philip would give Demosthenes' stances a focus and a raison d'être (reason for existence). Demosthenes saw the king of Macedon as a menace to the autonomy of all Greek cities and yet he presented him as a monster of Athens's own creation; in the First Philippic he reprimanded his fellow citizens as follows: [...] "Even <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>happens</b> to him, you will soon raise up a second Philip [...] ".* G.

He had traveled there from New York {{to play in}} a club with drummer George Reed and vocalist Herb Marshall. Kelly had a longstanding epilepsy problem, and had to monitor his condition carefully. An account of his death was given by his friend, Cobb: [...] "Wynton called his girlfriend in New York and said, 'You know, I don't feel good.' She said, 'Why don't you go downstairs to the bar and <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>happens</b> somebody could tend to you.' We don't know if he did that, because when they found him he was in the room." [...] Kelly was found in his room in the Westminster Hotel on Jarvis Street by Marshall.

500|$|The game's battle system, the BliTZ system, {{is carried}} over {{directly}} from Valkyira Chronicles. During missions, players select each unit using a top-down {{perspective of the}} battlefield map: once a character is selected, the player moves the character around the battlefield in third-person. A character can only act once per-turn, but characters can be granted multiple turns {{at the expense of}} other characters' turns. Each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their Action Gauge. Up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission. During gameplay, characters will call out <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>happens</b> to them, such as their health points (HP) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks. Each character has specific [...] "Potentials", skills unique to each character. They are divided into [...] "Personal Potential", which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character, and [...] "Battle Potentials", which are grown throughout the game and always grant boons to a character. To learn Battle Potentials, each character has a unique [...] "Masters Table", a grid-based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills. Characters also have Special Abilities that grant them temporary boosts on the battlefield: Kurt can activate [...] "Direct Command" [...] and move around the battlefield without depleting his Action Point gauge, the character Reila can shift into her [...] "Valkyria Form" [...] and become invincible, while Imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon.|$|E

Dahmer received superficial wounds and was not seriously hurt in this incident. According to Dahmer's family, he had long been ready to die, and accepted any punishment which he may endure in prison. In addition to his father and stepmother retaining regular contact, Dahmer's mother, Joyce, retained regular contact with her son (although prior to his arrest, the two had not seen each other since Christmas 1983). Joyce Dahmer related that in her weekly phone calls, whenever she expressed concerns for her son's physical well-being, Dahmer would respond with comments to the effect of: [...] "It doesn't matter, Mom.

60|$|The {{chameleon}} in {{the hotel}} court. He is fat and indolent and contemplative; but is business-like and capable when a fly comes about --reaches out a tongue like a teaspoon and takes him in. He gums his tongue first. He is always pious, in his looks. And pious and thankful both, when Providence or one of us sends him a fly. He has a froggy head, and a back like a new grave--for shape; and hands like a bird's toes that have been frostbitten. But his eyes are his exhibition feature. A couple of skinny cones project {{from the sides of}} his head, with a wee shiny bead of an eye set in the apex of each; and these cones turn bodily like pivot-guns and point every-which-way, and they are independent of each other; each has its own exclusive machinery. When I am behind him and C. in front of him, he whirls one eye rearwards and the other forwards--which gives him a most Congressional expression (one eye on the constituency and one on the swag); and then <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>happens</b> above and below him he shoots out one eye upward like a telescope and the other downward--and this changes his expression, but does not improve it.|$|E

50|$|The gambler's fallacy, {{also known}} as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the {{maturity}} of chances, is the mistaken belief that, <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>happens</b> more frequently than normal during some period, it will happen less frequently in the future, or that, <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>happens</b> less frequently than normal during some period, it will happen more frequently in the future (presumably as a means of balancing nature).

This fallacy can arise in many practical situations, but is most strongly associated with gambling, where such mistakes are common among players.|$|E
