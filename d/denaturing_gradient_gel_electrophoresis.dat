40|$|The present work {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the microbial dynamics during the anaerobic treatment of the azo dye blue HRFL in bench scale upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor operated at ambient temperature. Sludge samples were collected under distinct operational phases, when the reactor were stable (low variation of color removal), to assess the effect of glucose and yeast extract as source of carbon and redox mediators, respectively. Reactors performance was evaluated based on COD (chemical oxygen demand) and color removal. The microbial dynamics were investigated by PCR-DGGE (Polimerase Chain Reaction - <b>Denaturing</b> <b>Gradient</b> of <b>Gel</b> <b>Electrophoresis)</b> technique by comparing the 16 S rDNA profiles among samples. The {{results suggest that the}} composition of microorganisms changed from the beginning {{to the end of the}} reactor operation, probably in response to the presence of azo dye and/or its degradation byproducts. Despite the highest efficiency of color removal was observed in the presence of 500 mg/L of yeast extract (up to 93 %), there were no differences regarding the microbial profiles that could indicate a microbial selection by the yeast extract addition. On the other hand Methosarcina barkeri was detected only in the end of operation when the best efficiencies on color removal occurred. Nevertheless the biomass selection observed in the last stages of UASB operation is probably a result of the washout of the sludge in response of accumulation of aromatic amines which led to tolerant and very active biomass that contributed to high efficiencies on color removal...|$|R

The maximum degradation rate was 46 the same in top-soil and sub-soil samples. Although diverse tfdAα and tfdA genes were 47 present prior to mecoprop-p degradation, real time PCR revealed that degradation was 48 associated with proliferation of tfdA genes.

50|$|With {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) being {{among the most popular}} contexts in which DNA denaturation is desired, heating is the most frequent method of denaturation. Other than denaturation by heat, nucleic acids can undergo the denaturation process through various chemical agents such as formamide, guanidine, sodium salicylate, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), propylene glycol, and urea. These chemical denaturing agents lower the melting temperature (Tm) by competing for hydrogen bond donors and acceptors with pre-existing nitrogenous base pairs. Some agents are even able to induce denaturation at room temperature.

The advancement of technology led to new DNA material testing methods and this discovery changed the view of ABCD syndrome completely. A homozygous mutation means that there was an identical mutation on both the maternal and paternal genes. The identifying clinical report stated the test was done by scanning the Kurdish family for mutations in the EDNRB gene and the EDN3 gene by using a test called <b>denaturing</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis.</b> The electrophoresis test takes advantage of electrical currents and differences in melting points of fragments of DNA or RNA to move them based on their molecular weight; the differences in mobility of the fragments then can be analyzed to determine different sequences and to detect individual alleles. Different nucleotides in DNA are codes for certain proteins, which are formed by different patterns of the base pairs adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. The combination of adenine and thymine and guanine and cytosine align on the double strands of DNA. The test results found “an aberrant DGGE pattern of exon 3 of the EDNRB gene.

It is unknown if the BRAF mutation status has any predictive value for therapeutic approaches such as angiogenesis inhibition. Patients and Methods: We used 2 methods to analyze the BRAF mutation status in 52 of 62 melanoma patients. Method 1 (mutation-specific real-time PCR) specifically detects the most frequent BRAF mutations, V 600 E and V 600 K. Method 2 (<b>denaturing</b> <b>gel</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> and direct sequencing) identifies any mutations affecting exons 11 and 15. Results: Eighteen BRAF mutations and 15 wild-type mutations were identified with both methods. One tumor had a double mutation (GAA) in codon 600. Results of 3 samples were discrepant. Additional mutations (V 600 M, K 601 E) were detected using method 2. Sixteen DNA samples were analyzable with either method 1 or method 2. There was a significant association between BRAF V 600 E mutation and survival. Conclusion: Standardized tissue fixation protocols are needed to optimize BRAF mutation analysis in melanoma. For melanoma treatment decisions, the availability of a fast and reliable BRAF V 600 E screening method may be sufficient.

The indirect molecular approach, <b>Denaturing</b> <b>Gel</b> <b>Gradient</b> <b>Electrophoresis</b> (DGGE) of a gene fragment coding for either 16 S rRNA or 28 S rRNA, for bacteria or fungi respectively, was used to evaluate the variability of microbial community structures among different biofilm substrata: natural (pebbles, live plants, wood and sediment), or artificial (glass, Plexiglas® and sterile wood), in a small river (the Loiret, France). Multivariate statistics, band richness and diversity indexes (Shannon and Simpson) were used to highlight variations in community structure between substrata. Results showed variations of bacterial and fungal diversity between different substrata according to substratum properties/origin (natural or artificial, organic or inorganic) but there was no optimal substratum for sampling, and artificial substrata were not significantly less applicable than natural substrata. Pooling 4 different substrata types allowed a higher bacterial and fungal biodiversity recovery. Point contact sampling may thus gain in robustness by increasing the number of substrata considered. Fungal species richness was similar to the bacterial one on most substrata which suggested they should be more frequently considered in riverine biofilm studies.|$|R

All of the PCDD/F congeners detected were equally reduced without the accumulation of significant amounts of less-chlorinated congeners as the intermediate or end products. Alternatively, large amounts of catechol and salicylic acid were produced in the upper aqueous phase. Thus, the dechlorination of PCDD/Fs and the oxidative degradation of the dechlorinated products seemed to take place simultaneously in the microcosm. <b>Denaturing</b> <b>gel</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> and clone library analyses of PCR-amplified 16 S rRNA genes from the microcosm showed {{that members of the}} phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes predominated.

Most of the clones thus obtained formed a cluster distinct from the typical “Dehalococcoides” group. Quinone profiling indicated that ubiquinones accounted for 18 to 25 % of the total quinone content, suggesting the coexistence and activity of ubiquinone-containing aerobic bacteria.

The soil treated with the bioorganic fertilizer increased soil pH value, electric conductivity, organic carbon, NH 4 +-N, NO 3 [...] N and available K content, microbial activities and microbial biomass carbon content, which were positively related with soil suppressiveness. Bacterial and actinomycete populations assessed using classical plate counts were highest, whereas R. solanacearum and fungal populations were lowest in soil applied with the bioorganic fertilizer. Microbial community diversity and richness were assessed using <b>denaturing</b> <b>gel</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> profile analysis. The soil treated with the bioorganic fertilizer exhibited higher bacterial community diversity but lower fungal community diversity. Redundancy analysis showed that bacterial community diversity and richness negatively related with bacterial wilt suppressiveness, while fungal community richness positively correlated with R. solanacearum population. We concluded that the alteration of soil physicochemical and biological properties in soil treated with the bioorganic fertilizer induced the soil suppressiveness against tomato bacterial wilt...|$|R
