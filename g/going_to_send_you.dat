500|$|Two {{months prior}} to her death, Alcorn sought out help on the social media website Reddit, asking users whether the {{treatment}} perpetrated by her parents was considered child abuse. There, she revealed that while her parents had never physically assaulted her, [...] "they always talked {{to me in a}} very derogatory tone" [...] and [...] "would say things like 'You'll never be a real girl' or 'What're you going to do, fuck boys?' or 'God's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>you</b> straight to hell'. These all made me feel awful about myself, I was Christian at the time so I thought that God hated me and that I didn't deserve to be alive." [...] Further, she explained, [...] "I tried my absolute hardest to live up to their standards and be a straight male, but eventually I realized that I hated religion and my parents." [...] On Reddit, Alcorn also disclosed that she was prescribed increasing dosages of the anti-depressant Prozac. In concluding her post, she wrote, [...] "Please help me, I don't know what I should do and I can't take much more of this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{discussing}} the record with Rolling Stone she discussed her selection of producers for the record, {{with a goal}} to create [...] "a unique record" [...] becoming the basis of her selection. After being asked whether there was anyone she wished to work with on the record, Roberts declared that she wanted Kate Bush. However, contacting Bush was difficult; after asking and hinting to her record label during the year she was producing the album, she found that nobody could establish communications. Electropop band Dragonette worked on the album, producing the second single from the album, [...] "Lucky Day". The band {{were among the first}} to work on the record. Roberts co-wrote the lyrics, saying: [...] "When I wrote 'Lucky Day' I had short hair and was really into '40s fashion. All of the 'woah woah woah woah' and the 'ah ha' really is a reflection of that." [...] She also stated when it came to the production of the track, early in 2011, that she wanted to produce a [...] "more downbeat dance record" [...] noting it was what she was into at that point". Roberts worked with producer Diplo, who co-produced the track [...] "Beat of My Drum", she explained whilst talking to The Guardian, [...] "I had to ring him [...] and… you know when you ring a boy for the first time? I knew I only had one chance, so I just fired at him. 'I want this, I want that, don't send it back like that. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>you</b> the session again just so you've got it.' He reassured me a bit, and I put the phone down, thinking, it's not in my hands now". When Roberts received the track back from Diplo, she was too nervous to listen to it, as it meant so much to her. Whilst back in her hometown of Liverpool she put her younger brother and sister in the car with her, and after burning the track to a CD, drove to a deserted field and played it loudly. After positive responses from the pair, Roberts declared [...] "I'm so proud of it. I can't believe it's mine. The man is a genius". Roberts worked with producer Joseph Mount on the album, recording two songs. For years before the pair started work together, Mount had mentioned several times that he wished to work with Girls Aloud (Roberts' former group), and had sent [...] "short beats" [...] to her, including music which he thought the record label would approve of, as well as a wild-card style compilation. When the two started work in the studio, both of the tracks produced by Mount were chosen from the wild-card category, with lyrics written by Roberts, and the melodies in the tracks produced jointly.|$|E

[...] "I didn't tell any {{one that}} I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> for <b>you,</b> Reddy," [...] said she, [...] "for I {{was afraid that}} if I did no one would come this morning.

We was expecting to start for Buxton, but some money that Jone had ordered to be sent from London {{two or three days}} before didn't come, and {{he thought it would be}} wise for him to go and look after it. So yesterday, which was Saturday, we started off for London, and came straight to the Babylon Hotel, where we had been before.|$|R

40|$|Transcription begins] 26 November 1944 Somewheres in Germany My most {{precious}} jewel, Today, I again {{hit the jackpot}} on the mail situation. Yes 11 letters and a serviceman’s box from the Heights’ B’nai B’rith. I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> write a thank you note to the B’nai B’rith as soon as I finish writing to you. Among the letters were a letter from Mort, a letter from Sanford dated Nov. 12 (whatta surprise) 2 ̆ 6 your letters with the following dates: Oct. 25 and Oct. 22 2 ̆ 6 25 (newspaper clippings), an anniversary card (2 yrs. 2 ̆ 6 5 months of delicious married life), and a Thanksgiving card. Also a V-Mail from my folks. Actually, dear, I’m surprised at myself, for I, too, am carrying on an intensive, as well as extensive, correspondence. In our present set-up, I can do {{an awful lot of}} letter writing. The weather here continues to be nice; however, I hear that in some areas not far from here they have been having snow. Brr— We listened to the Ohio State-Michigan game last night and got a genuine thrill with State coming from behind to win. My heart went out to the announcer who complained that his hands were so cold he [sic] it was necessary that he sit on his hands to keep them warm. Tsch, tsch, I would recommend that he come over here where it is much “hotter. ” We received a bunch of Christmas cards in the PX distribution which I shall <b>send</b> <b>to</b> our friends. Most of them are cards which deal with troops in France. I suppose they haven’t come out yet with cards from Germany. I’m very interested to know whether you received the box I sent you and also whether you can use the film enclosed. Incidentally, my air mail letter to you yesterday contained a Nazi armband of the Nazi party. Tell me when you receive it. At the present time I am munching Nabisco Fig Newtons which are very good—make a good evening snack. We’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try and take pictures of our cozy little room and if they come out O. K. I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> it <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Darling, one thing I would greatly appreciate is a new picture of you. One that I can look at [at] times I get real sentimental. O. K., sweets? (Not that I don’t look at your picture constantly, either.) At the present time I’m listening to an opera coming over the radio. It’s a tough life, isn’t it? Sanford’s letter had a clever remark in the upper right-hand corner where I put “Somewhere in Germany. ” His remark was “Could it be anywhere else but from home?” Those sheets from the “Hobo News” were a “bit of all right. ” The paper has a lot of appeal. I showed Doc Luddecke Winkie’s letter to you and he innocently remarked, “an intelligent letter” and wants to keep it, so I gave it to him. He’s a good guy. Sweets, I adore your every atom 2 ̆ 6 molecule and that’s getting pretty small. I love you, Vic [Transcription ends...|$|R
