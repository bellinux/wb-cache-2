The bastard <b>grunt</b> (<b>Pomadasys</b> incisus) is a thermophilic species well adapted in the above area, but the status of fishery suggests an overexploitation. The sex ratio was in favour of males. The length frequency distribution did not differ between the sexes. Growth in weight was estimated {{by means of the}} length-weight relationship. Reproduction seemed to take place in summer. Certain morphometric characters appeared to be useful while comparing populations among the different populations in the Mediterranean...|$|R

50|$|Longnose {{stingrays}} seem {{to occupy}} {{basically the same}} ecological niche as the more northerly Atlantic stingray (D. sabina). Where the ranges of the two species overlap, there is spatial segregation with longnose stingrays being found at depths of 1 - 15 m and Atlantic stingrays being found at depths of up to 50 - 60 m. This species feeds mainly on benthic invertebrates and small bony fishes, often using its pectoral fins to uncover burrowing prey. Its pavement-like teeth enables it to grind up hard-shelled organisms. One study off the Brazilian state of Ceará found that the most common prey taken were holothuriid sea cucumbers, peanut worms, eunicid polychaete worms, bivalves and gastropods, the crustaceans Penaeus and Callinectes, and the <b>grunt</b> <b>Pomadasys</b> corvinaeformis. Known parasites of the longnose stingray include the tapeworms Rhinebothrium margaritense and Rhodobothrium pulvinatum, the isopods Excorallana tricornis and Rocinela signata, and the monogenean Monocotyle guttatae.|$|R

40|$|The {{artificial}} {{breeding of}} marine fish in China {{has been developed}} {{over a period of}} more than 50 years. Both species diversity and fry production have greatly increased since the 1980 s. By the year 2000, at least 52 species belonging to 24 families of marine fish had been successfully bred. Large quantities of cultured fry can meet the needs of both sea cage culture and pond culture for most species. Fish fry production has entered a period of sustainable. development. The number of artificially produced fry of large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) exceeded 1. 3 billion in year 2000. The species for which more than 10 million fry is produced annually through aquaculture are: red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), Japanese sea perch (Lateolabrax japonicus), redeye mullet (Liza haematocheila), cuneate drum (Nibea miichthioides), red seabream (Pagrosomus major), milkfish (Chanos chanos) and three-banded sweetlip (Plectorhynchus cinctus). Several millions of artificial fry are cultured annually for the following species: Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), black porgy (Sparus macrocephalus), silver sea perch (Lates calcarifer), Russell's snapper (Lutjanus russelli), javelin <b>grunt</b> (<b>Pomadasys</b> hasta), miiuy croaker (Miichthys miiuy), Chinese black sleeper (Bostrichthys sinensis) and skewband grunt (Hapalogenys nitens). Fishes belonging to the family Sciaenidae are now the major species for artificial propagation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A {{population}} analysis was made using {{data of the}} <b>grunt</b> <b>Pomadasys</b> panamensis. The information is from the catch from 260 hauls in estuarine waters, open-ocean waters, and {{off the coast of}} Sinaloa and northern Nayarit, Mexico, in the southeastern Gulf of California. The area of influence is about 120, 000 km 2 and includes {{about a third of the}} drag area of the largest shrimp fleet of the American Pacific. The average length in the population was 210 mm. The maximum length was 430 mm and the minimum was 50 mm. The analysis for the frequency distributions of the lengths and the multinomial solution produced representative modal groups for 160 mm, 190 mm, and 230 mm. The simulation of the biomass density gave an estimate close to 90 t, with 650, 000 organisms before starting the fishing season in the region. The density was 0. 19 kg ha– 1. The colonization was 0. 42 % or 42 %. The model was validated using the Aikaikae criterion (AIC). The results provide an overview of the initial biomass densities and population structure of the species caught as bycatch, demonstrating the importance of this species abundance in the shrimp fishery, and generating a source of monetary income to the crew of the fishing fleet. The persistence of the species to fishing provides an example to study the mechanisms of survival...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to measure cadmium and lead {{concentrations}} in the edible tissues of Saddle <b>grunt</b> <b>Pomadasys</b> maculatus (Bloch, 1793) from Karachi Fish Harbor different seasons of the year 2011.   Results showed that the concentration varied from 0. 18 to 1. 14 with a mean of 0. 59 ± 0. 05 mg. kg- 1 for Cd and from 0. 02 to 1. 54 with a mean of 0. 54 ± 0. 05 mg. kg- 1 for Pb. These concentrations are higher than the maximum permissible values in European and other international regulations (Global Agricultural Information Network Report for China, Russian Federation, Australia New Zealand Food Standards, Georgian Food Safety Rules, Turkish Food Codex and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food). However the average weekly intakes of Cd and Pb per body weight values (minimum-maximum) were 0. 021 (0. 0063 - 0. 0399) and 0. 019 (0. 0007 - 0. 0539) mg. week- 1. 70 kg body weight- 1, respectively and not exceeded the Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI) established. Consumption of Saddle grunt from the Karachi coasts of Pakistan can therefore be said to constitute no health risks so far as the heavy metals investigated are concerned. However, due to the Cd and Pb muscle levels exceeded the maximum levels of fish permitted for human consumption, a plausible health risk could be posed by long-term exposed through Saddle grunt consumption.

40|$|Growth and {{exploitation}} {{parameters of the}} Sompat <b>grunt</b> <b>Pomadasys</b> jubelini (Cuvier, 1830) in Grand-Lahou, Ebrié and Aby lagoons complex (Ivory Coast, West Africa). The growth {{and exploitation}} parameters of Pomadasys jubelini (Cuvier, 1830) were studied from January 2007 to December 2008 in Grand-Lahou, Ebrié and Aby lagoons. A total of 2284 specimens (8. 50 to 32. 70 cm FL) were examined. Length-frequency data collected were analyzed with FiSAT software (FAO-ICLARM Fish Stock Assessment Tool). The demographic structure of P. jubelini was composed of young individuals with a majorant allometric growth. Estimation of growth and exploitation parameters gave: L∞= 33. 60 cm; K= 0. 53 year- 1; t 0 = - 0, 30 year; φ'= 2. 78; M= 1. 10 year- 1; F= 0. 26 year- 1; E= 0. 19 in Grand-Lahou lagoon, L∞= 31. 50 cm; K= 0. 56 year- 1; t 0 = - 0, 29 year; φ'= 2. 75; M= 1. 21 year- 1; F= 0. 63 year- 1; E= 0. 34 in Ebrié lagoon and L∞= 31. 50 cm; K= 0. 57 year- 1; t 0 = - 0, 28 year; φ'= 2. 74; M= 1. 22 year- 1; F= 0. 71 year- 1; E= 0. 37 in Aby lagoon.

40|$|Background. Bastard <b>grunt,</b> <b>Pomadasys</b> incisus (Bowdich, 1825), is {{reported}} as a well-established {{species in the}} Mediterranean Sea. Although bastard grunt has rapidly expanded its area of distribution in the Mediterranean, there is no information about its age and growth. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide data about growth, condition, and first sexual maturity of the species in order to contribute to a better management of its fishery. Materials and methods. A total of 515 specimens of bastard grunt were caught in the Gulf of Tunis. The age was determined from otoliths. Length–weight relation, von Bertalanffy equation, and growth rate were employed to evaluate the fish growth. Also the condition factor and length at first sexual maturity were calculated. Results. In the Gulf of Tunis population, females were significantly predominant and the overall sex ratio (M : F) reached the value of 1 : 2. 17. The two sexes showed a positive allometric growth. The marginal increment analysis validated the annual deposition of one single annulus in the winter. Growth in (total) length (TL) was approximately 65 % during the first year of life. The von Bertalanffy growth equation was TL = 23. 9 × (1 – e– 0. 186 × (t + 4. 62)). The somatic condition of fish increased markedly during the late spring and summer. Length at first sexual maturity of the bastard grunt was 16. 6 cm for males and 16. 8 cm for females, which correspond to an age of about 2 years. Conclusion. The rapid growth during the first year of life, the early maturity and the moderately short life cycle contribute to the relatively fast spreading of the species...|$|R
40|$|The bastard <b>grunt</b> (<b>Pomadasys</b> incisus) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} coastal demersal fishes inhabiting the Canary Islands. Age and growth were studied from samples collected between October 2000 and September 2001. Growth analysis revealed that this species is a fast growing and moderately short-lived species (ages up to seven years recorded). Length-at-age was described by the von Bertalanffy growth model (L∞= 309. 58 mm; k= 0. 220 /year; t 0 =– 1. 865 year), the Schnute growth model (y 1 = 126. 66 mm; y 2 = 293. 50 mm; a=– 0. 426; b= 5. 963), and the seasonalized von Bertalanffy growth model (L∞= 309. 93 mm; k= 0. 218 / year; t 0 = – 1. 896 year; C= 0. 555; ts= 0. 652). Individuals grow quickly in their first year, attaining approximately 60 % of their maximum length; after the first year, their growth rate drops rapidly as energy is probably diverted to reproduction. The parameters of the von Bertalanffy weight growth curve were W∞= 788. 22 mm; k= 0. 1567 /year; t 0 = – 1. 984 year. Fish total length and otolith radius were closely correlated, r 2 = 0. 912. A power relationship was estimated between the total length and the otolith radius (a= 49. 93; ν= 0. 851). A year’s growth was represented by an opaque and hyaline (translucent) zone—an annulus. Backcalculated lengths were similar to those predicted by the growth models. Growth parameters estimated from the backcalculated sizes at age were L∞= 315. 23 mm; k= 0. 217 /year; and t 0 = – 1. 73 year...|$|R
40|$|The sex ratio, gonadosomatic index, {{stages of}} gonadal {{development}} and fecundity of saddle <b>grunt</b> fish, <b>Pomadasys</b> maculatum (Block, 1793) of the Karachi coast were investigated. Pomadasys maculatum had a sex ratio of 1 : 1. 36 (male to female). The difference in sex ratio {{was not significantly}} different (p> 0. 05) from the expected theoretically 1 : 1 distribution except June, September and December. Gonadosomatic index value in males during August – November were 3. 109 to 5. 630, while in females the high values during August – December {{were found to be}} 3. 542 to 6. 679, which suggested the spawning period. The highest GSI value in males was 5. 967 in stage VI and the lowest GSI value was 1. 256 recorded during VII stage. GSI values in males increased slowly reaching for maximum in 5. 967 in (stage VI), while in females at high value was 6. 630 during stage VI and the lowest GSI values were 1. 625 and 1. 124 during stages I & II respectively. Seven stages of gonadal development were observed in male and female fish. Pomadasys maculatum is found in coastal waters over sand near reefs or muddy bottoms.
