40|$|We {{examined}} {{optical fibers}} suitable for avoiding such problems as the fiber fuse phenomenon and <b>failures</b> <b>at</b> bends {{with a high}} power input. We found that the threshold power for fiber fuse propagation in photonic crystal fiber (PCF) and hole-assisted fiber (HAF) can exceed 18 W, {{which is more than}} 10 times that in conventional single-mode fiber (SMF). We considered this high threshold power in PCF and HAF to be caused by a jet of high temperature fluid penetrating the air holes. We showed examples of two kinds of <b>failures</b> <b>at</b> bends in conventional SMF when the input power was 9 W. We also observed the generation of a fiber fuse under a condition that caused a bend-loss induced failure. We showed that one solution for the <b>failures</b> <b>at</b> bends is to use optical fibers with a low bending loss such as PCF and HAF. Therefore, we consider PCF and HAF to be attractive solutions to the problems of the fiber fuse phenomenon and <b>failures</b> <b>at</b> bends with a high power input...|$|R

Worn down by stresses of command, his health was so poor it forced his evacuation to England.|$|E

5|$|Following his <b>failure</b> <b>at</b> Fredericksburg, Burnside was {{reassigned to}} the Department of the Ohio. The IX Corps, {{which he had}} {{formerly}} commanded, was reassigned with him. The 21st Massachusetts boarded trains for Cincinnati on March 28, 1863. They were then transported to Mount Sterling, Kentucky, to combat Confederate guerrillas. In April, due to the reduced numbers of the regiment (now about 200) several officers, being effectively without commands, chose to resign their commissions, including Col. William S. Clark. Command of the regiment passed to Lt. Col. George P. Hawkes.|$|E

40|$|Previous work on {{planning}} {{accelerated life tests}} {{has been}} based on large-sample approximations to evaluate test plan properties. In this paper, we use more accurate simulation methods to investigate the properties of accelerated life tests with small sample sizes where large-sample approximations might not be expected to be adequate. These properties include the simulated s-bias and variance for quantiles of the failure-time distribution at use conditions. We focus on using these methods to find practical compromise test plans that use three levels of stress. We also study the effects of not having any <b>failures</b> <b>at</b> test conditions and the effect of using incorrect planning values. We note that the large-sample approximate variance is far from adequate when the probability of zero <b>failures</b> <b>at</b> certain test conditions is not negligible. We suggest a strategy to develop useful test plans using a small number of test units while meeting constraints on the estimation precision and on the probability that there will be zero <b>failures</b> <b>at</b> {{one or more of the}} test stress levels...|$|R

5|$|In retirement, Newland {{served as}} Assistant Commissioner of the Australian Red Cross Society in the Northern Territory during the later months of 1941.

At his home in Caulfield, Victoria, on 19 March 1949, he died suddenly of heart <b>failure</b> <b>at</b> the age of 67.

5|$|Marshall died {{of heart}} <b>failure</b> <b>at</b> the age of 38 in 1939. Twenty-five years later, {{partly as a result}} of his efforts, The Wilderness Society helped gain passage of the Wilderness Act. The Act was passed by Congress in 1964 and legally defined {{wilderness}} areas of the United States and protected some nine million acres (36,000km2) of federal land. Today, Marshall is considered largely responsible for the wilderness preservation movement. Several areas and landmarks, including The Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana and Mount Marshall in the Adirondacks, have been named in his honor.|$|E
