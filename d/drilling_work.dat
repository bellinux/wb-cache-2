However, after {{the purchase}} of a second offshore lease in 2008, Shell only commenced <b>drilling</b> <b>work</b> in 2012, due to the refurbishment of rigs, permit delays from the relevant authorities and lawsuits.

2500|$|Ten years later, SDC was recommissioned {{to drill}} an {{exploratory}} well for Encana Oil & Gas at the McCovey prospect off Alaska. After {{a month and}} a half of preparations, the rig was towed back to the Beaufort Sea in July 2002 by two icebreakers, Arctic Kalvik and Kigoria, which completed the [...] tow from Port Clarence in just 12 days. The preparations for the winter were stopped on 15 August for about two months to avoid disturbing the bowhead whaling season. Drilling of the well, located in only [...] of water, began on 6 December 2002 and was completed on 27 January 2003. With no immediate <b>drilling</b> <b>work</b> available for SDC, the rig was towed to Thetis Bay where it had previously been stored for two winters. In 2003, the ownership of the drilling unit was passed to a Liberian-registered company, SDC Drilling Inc, and both SDC and SDC II were reflagged to Liberia.|$|E

50|$|Installing a wired {{switch in}} a solid brick or {{concrete}} wall or installing on a plaster or tiled wall requires delicate routing and drilling {{to create a}} channel in the wall for the wire and space for the switch and switch box inside the wall.
