5|$|Alexander Rueda {{was treated}} at Washoe Medical Center for his wounds and {{released}} the same day, while Kenzie McKeon only {{needed to be}} treated at the scene for superficial wounds. The school was placed on lockdown <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> then classes were canceled {{for the remainder of}} the day. The shooting was the second firearm-related incident on Pine Middle School grounds in two weeks, with the previous incident being a man brandishing a gun towards the campus. On that occasion school administrators sent students home as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, a {{delivery}} from Larwood knocked Woodfull's bat {{from his hands}} and the Australian captain seemed unsettled. Two quick wickets fell before Ponsford joined Woodfull in the middle, but having been struck by short balls several more times, Woodfull was bowled by Allen for 22, having batted <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> a half. When a doctor was publicly requested, to attend an injury to Voce, many in the crowd believed it was Woodfull who required assistance, leading to a renewal of protest. In later years, Woodfull's wife believed that his injury at Adelaide was partly responsible for his death aged 67 in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{previous}} failures, the Chinese launched another series of attacks from 11:30 and these attacks continued {{for the next}} two hours, again targeting 12 Platoon under the command of Lieutenant John Ward. Failing to break through again, the Chinese suffered heavy casualties before the assault ended. From 13:30 there was another lull in the fighting <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> a half, although D Company continued to endure Chinese mortar, machine-gun and rifle fire. Believing that the battle may continue into the night, Gravener made the decision to pull 12 Platoon back in order to adopt a tighter company perimeter, lest his forward platoon be overrun and destroyed. The movement was completed without incident and, shortly after, the newly vacated position was assaulted by a large Chinese force which had failed to detect the withdrawal. The Chinese moved quickly as they attempted to establish their position on the northern end of the ridge, only to be heavily engaged by Australian machine-gun and rifle fire, and artillery.|$|E

5|$|Enron's audit {{committee}} was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover {{large amounts of}} material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> a half. Enron's {{audit committee}} {{did not have the}} technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on the committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.|$|E
5|$|Guam then {{returned}} to Task Force 58, assigned to Cruiser Division 16, part of Task Group 58.4, and steamed to Okinawa. On the night of 2728 March, Guam {{and the rest of}} Cruiser Division 16 bombarded the airfield on Minamidaitō. After concluding the bombardment, Guam returned to the carrier screen while they conducted operations off Nansei Shoto until 11 May. The ship then steamed to Ulithi for periodic maintenance and to replenish ammunition and supplies. She {{then returned}} to Okinawa, assigned to Task Group 38.4 of William Halsey's Third Fleet. She continued to provide anti-aircraft defense for the carriers while they launched fighter sweeps of Kyushu. Guam and Alaska bombarded Oki Daitō <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> a half on 9 June, after which they steamed to San Pedro Bay in the Leyte Gulf, arriving on 13 June.|$|E
5|$|Laforey {{immediately}} advanced on {{the strange}} sails, which were soon {{revealed to be}} Castor and the Dutch merchant ship. With Carysfort bearing down on him L'Huillier cast off the tow and prepared for battle, meeting the approaching British frigate with a broadside. The engagement was fought at close range and with little manoeuvering by either side, the ships exchanging broadsides <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> fifteen minutes before L'Huillier surrendered. His ship was heavily battered in the exchange, with the main topgallantmast knocked down and the mainmast and hull severely damaged. Carysfort suffered just one man killed and four wounded from the understrength crew of 180, while casualties were much heavier among the approximately 200 men aboard Castor, the French losing 16 men killed and nine wounded. The Dutch ship initially escaped, but was later captured and its value was eventually included in the prize money paid for Castor.|$|E

5|$|Harrison allowed Secretary of State-designate Daniel Webster to edit {{his inauguration}} speech, but he {{nevertheless}} spoke <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> 45 minutes, setting {{a record for}} verbosity that still stands. As the public was not excluded from the White House, there was no relief from the swarms of office seekers even after March 4, and relations with Clay broke down {{to such an extent}} that President Harrison banned him from the White House. Clay left town, never to see the President again. Harrison, despite the office seekers, liked to walk to the market each morning but on March 24 got caught in the rain and soon fell ill. The primitive treatment he received, possibly influenced by his own medical training a half-century old, did nothing to improve his condition, and he died in the early morning hours of April 4. Vice President Tyler had returned to his home in Virginia once the Senate adjourned, and Secretary of State Webster sent his son Fletcher to inform Tyler of Harrison's death.|$|E
5|$|Scáthach teaches Cú Chulainn all {{the arts}} of war, {{including}} the use of the Gáe Bulg, a terrible barbed spear, thrown with the foot, that has to be cut out of its victim. His fellow trainees include Ferdiad, who becomes Cú Chulainn's best friend and foster-brother. During his time there, Scáthach faces a battle against Aífe, her rival and in some versions her twin sister. Scáthach, knowing Aífe's prowess, fears for Cú Chulainn's life and gives him a powerful sleeping potion to keep him from the battle. However, because of Cú Chulainn's great strength, it only puts him to sleep <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>and</b> he soon joins the fray. He fights Aífe in single combat, and the two are evenly matched, but Cú Chulainn distracts her by calling out that Aífe's horses and chariot, the things she values most in the world, have fallen off a cliff, and seizes her. With his sword at her throat, he agrees to spare her life on the condition that she call off her enmity with Scáthach, and bear him a son.|$|E

25|$|Stokes and Prior {{frustrated}} Australia <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> a half on {{the fifth}} day before Prior was dismissed for 26. Shortly afterwards, Stokes reached his maiden Test century, and the tourists went into lunch at 6/332. However, he was caught by Haddin off the bowling of Lyon for 120 straight after the resumption, and Australia was able to wrap up the innings for 353. Australia won by 150 runs, securing a 3–0 series lead, and with it, their first Ashes series win since 2006–07. Smith was man of the match for his hundred in the first innings.|$|E
25|$|Pan Am Flight 845, a Boeing 747, on 30 July 1971. When {{taking off}} from San Francisco International Airport, the plane struck the {{approach}} lighting system after taxiing onto a much too short runway. After the impact, the plane continued into the takeoff roll, though its fuselage, landing gear, and 3 out of 4 hydraulic systems were badly damaged. After making a full circle over the Pacific Ocean <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> 42 minutes and dumping fuel, the plane made a hard emergency landing at San Francisco, ending on its tail. All 218 passengers survived {{with just a few}} minor injuries.|$|E
25|$|Four overs {{into the}} morning, {{specialist}} spin bowler Ashley Giles {{was involved in}} a dismissal for the only time in the match, having Lee run out for 8. However, Jason Gillespie batted <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> 15 minutes, and took part in a 52-run stand with the recognised batsman, Katich before Simon Jones got his reward with an away-swinger that crashed into Gillespie's off stump, after having three catches dropped. The last wicket partnership rubbed it in with 43 more runs before Katich was caught by Simon Jones off Harmison, but England were set what would be a world record 420 to win.|$|E

25|$|On 25 September, {{the second}} British {{round of the}} World Championship of Makes arrived for the Brands Hatch Six-Hours; it was run in a deluge which caused it to be stopped <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> it was {{eventually}} run over 103 laps – 269 miles – which Jacky Ickx and Jochen Mass won at 97.696mph driving a Porsche 935/2 Turbo. The race totally dominated by the Stuttgart marque, the first five places going to Porsche 935 Turbos – a 934 Turbo was sixth with a Carrera seventh. A little relief came with the eighth-place BMW 320i, two more Porsches rounded out the first ten. In November, Brands Hatch took over {{the running of the}} annual Formula Ford Festival (which it still holds to this day) from Snetterton. This was won by Irishman Derek Daly in a Hawke DL17.|$|E
25|$|While off Land's End on 29 May 1794 {{she came}} across , sailing under French colours. The Castor, {{originally}} under Captain Thomas Troubridge, {{had been captured}} twenty days earlier by a French squadron under Joseph-Marie Nielly during the Atlantic campaign of May 1794. Castor was being sailed back to France by a French prize crew {{at the time she}} was discovered, and was towing a Dutch brig. The French cast off the brig and fought Carysfort <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> a quarter, before surrendering. Carysforts casualties amounted to one dead and four wounded, while the French in Castor had 16 killed and nine wounded. One master's mate and eighteen seaman of the original crew were released after the recapture, but Troubridge and most of the British crew had been taken aboard Nielly's flagship, Sans Pareil, and would {{have to wait for the}} defeat of the French fleets at the Glorious First of June and the capture of Sans Pareil before they could be freed.|$|E
25|$|Pigot {{engaged the}} vessels <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>and</b> after Matilda had grounded, took his crew in her boats and {{captured}} Golden Grove. The British then captured {{the other two}} vessels. Lastly, Pigot fired {{on a group of}} 100 militia and a field gun, dispersing them. The British had two men killed, and 14 wounded, including Pigot, who had received two bullet wounds to his head and one to a leg. Spanish casualties were reportedly 25 men killed (including five Americans) and 22 men wounded. A crowd of Americans on the Georgia side of the river watched the entire battle. Pigot was unable to extricate himself and his prizes from the river until 21 July, but during the entire period he remained in command except when he was getting his wounds dressed. For his efforts Pigot received a promotion to commander, and the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund awarded him a medal and a plate worth £50.|$|E
