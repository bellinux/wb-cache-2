5|$|The {{domestic}} political environment was <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> {{the death of}} Paul Eyschen, who had been Prime Minister for 27 years. With his death came a string of short-lived governments, culminating in rebellion, and constitutional turmoil after the withdrawal of German soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Adding to Tony's {{complicated}} life is {{his relationship}} with his wife Carmela (Edie Falco), which is strained by his constant infidelity and her struggle to reconcile the reality of Tony's business (which she is often in denial of), with the affluent lifestyle and higher social status it brings her. Both have up-and-down relationships with their two children: the intelligent-but-rebellious Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler), and underachiever A.J. (i.e., Anthony, Jr.) (Robert Iler), whose everyday teenage issues are <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> their eventual knowledge of their father's criminal activities and reputation.|$|E
5|$|At least 30% of TBI are not {{discovered}} at first; this number {{may be as}} high as 50%. In about 10% of cases, TBI has no specific signs either clinically or on chest radiography, and its detection may be <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> concurrent injuries, since TBI tends to occur after high-energy accidents. Weeks or months may go by before the injury is diagnosed, even though the injury is better known {{than it was in the}} past.|$|E
50|$|John 20:9 <b>further</b> <b>complicates</b> {{this debate}} <b>by</b> stating that they {{remained}} ignorant, without clearly explaining who they are.|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} <b>further</b> humorously <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> the love {{interests}} of the brothers; whilst the murdered Buster was engaged to entertainer Midge Mallon (Vera-Ellen), Edwin is admired by librarian Ellen Shanley (Virginia Mayo).|$|R
5000|$|Kurita, {{unaware that}} Ozawa's decoy plan had succeeded, assumed {{he had found}} a carrier group from Halsey's 3rd Fleet. Having just redeployed his ships into {{anti-aircraft}} formation, he <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> matters <b>by</b> ordering a [...] "General Attack", which called for his fleet to split into divisions and attack independently.|$|R
5|$|By 14:00 the 4th Parachute Brigade was {{no further}} forward. With {{casualties}} mounting, Brigadier Hackett asked General Urquhart's permission to withdraw {{south of the}} railway line. His intention was to move through Wolfheze and into Oosterbeek where the division's support units waited. The change of direction was <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> the lack of vehicle crossings along the railway line—there were only two, one at Wolfheze and the other at Oosterbeek.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have to make}} {{considerable}} assumptions {{trying to}} reconstruct the full family tree because of extremely scarce written sources about {{the early history of}} Lithuania. The matter is <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> the 16–17th century genealogies, most famously the Bychowiec Chronicle, that mixed legends and facts into one. The legends about Palemonids, a noble family from the Roman Empire who settled in Lithuania and gave rise to the Duchy, are quite popular and widespread in these genealogies. The real historical data comes from the Russian and Livonian chronicles, most important of these being the Hypatian Codex.|$|E
5|$|The UK Film Council {{awarded the}} {{production}} £1million in June 2009. Filming began in December 2009, and lasted 39 days. Most {{was shot in}} the three weeks before Christmas because Rush would be performing in a play in January. The schedule was <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> Bonham Carter's availability: she worked on Harry Potter during the week, so her scenes had to be filmed during the weekend.|$|E
50|$|The Independent group {{remained}} the majority grouping on the Council. In the Llanelli area {{the potential for}} Labour to win <b>further</b> ground was <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> the appearance of Communist Party candidates.|$|R
5000|$|Ernest Adams critiques {{possible}} unexpected {{behavior by}} warp zones: [...] "Teleporters can <b>further</b> <b>complicate</b> matters <b>by</b> not always working the same way, teleporting the player to one place {{the first time}} they are used, but to somewhere else the second time, and so on. They can also be one-way or two-way, teleporting players somewhere with no way to get back, or allowing them to teleport again." ...|$|R
50|$|The Soviet {{government}} <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> {{the situation}} <b>by</b> dispatching troops {{to come to}} the aid of Jin and his military commander Sheng Shicai (盛世才), as did White Russian refugees from the Soviet Union living in the Ili River valley region.|$|R
5|$|The Uprising and its {{repression}} caused {{trauma that}} continues to manifest in the Malagasy population. Many Malagasy nationals fought each other and struggle to reconcile themselves to the remorse and guilt. Healing {{at the national level}} is <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> the fact that the same leaders who proclaimed Madagascar's independence in 1960 were those who had been major players in the PADESM political party, which had been favored by the colonial administration after the crushing of the revolt.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{development}} is commonly divided {{into the following}} stages: the bud stage, the cap, the bell, and finally maturation. The staging of tooth {{development is}} an attempt to categorize changes that take place along a continuum; frequently it is difficult to decide what stage should be assigned to a particular developing tooth. This determination is <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> the varying appearance of different histologic sections of the same developing tooth, which can appear to be different stages.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig), {{thanks to}} his new-found friend Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson), overhears the Duras sisters {{planning}} to rendezvous with the Bajoran to give him materials {{that could be used}} to build a bomb. The crew allow him to take a runabout and to arrest him after the transaction. Kira finds herself confused about her own past with the Bajoran resistance and where her current loyalties stand, and offers to go with Tahna in the runabout. Commander Sisko and Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) wait in a second runabout nearby while Tahna and Kira complete the transaction. When the second runabout appears, Tahna realizes he has been set up; matters are <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> the arrival of the Cardassian warship.|$|E
50|$|To this day, ongoing {{division}} has continued based on both ideologies and personalities, with sides forming between the moderate Chapman and conservative Evans family dynasties, <b>complicated</b> <b>further</b> <b>by</b> the moderate Brown and conservative Olsen rifts.|$|R
25|$|Cataloging Dussek's {{compositions}} has {{a history}} of its own. Dussek's oeuvre has historically been difficult to organize, {{due in part to the}} number of publishers who originally published his work, and to the fact that some of his works were published by more than one publisher. Some works published by multiple publishers were assigned different opus numbers; sometimes different works were given then same opus number by different publishers. Dussek <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> this <b>by</b> arranging works for different instrument combinations.|$|R
50|$|Skylab was {{launched}} on May 14, 1973 by the modified Saturn V. The launch is {{sometimes referred to}} as Skylab 1, or SL-1. Severe damage was sustained during launch and deployment, including the loss of the station's micrometeoroid shield/sun shade and one of its main solar panels. Debris from the lost micrometeoroid shield <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> matters <b>by</b> pinning the remaining solar panel {{to the side of the}} station, preventing its deployment and thus leaving the station with a huge power deficit.|$|R
5|$|In Scandinavian folklore, {{a diverse}} array of human-like supernatural beings are attested which might {{be thought of as}} elves and which might partly {{originate}} in medieval Scandinavian beliefs. However, the characteristics and names of these beings has varied widely across time and space, and they cannot be neatly categorised. These beings are sometimes known by words descended directly from Old Norse álfr. However, in the modern languages, these traditional terms have tended to be replaced with other terms. Things are <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> the fact that when referring to the elves of Old Norse mythology, scholars have adopted new forms based directly on the Old Norse word álfr. The following table summarises the situation in the main modern standard languages of Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|The TRC {{concluded}} {{that it may be}} impossible to ever identify the number of deaths or missing children, {{in part because of the}} habit of burying students in unmarked graves. The work is <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> a pattern of poor record keeping by school and government officials, who neglected to keep reliable numbers about the number of children who died or where they were buried. While most schools had cemeteries on site, their location and extent remain difficult to determine as cemeteries that were originally marked were found to have been later razed, intentionally hidden or built over.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{had a large}} {{impact on}} the community, with only 1,600 {{people living in the}} two Russian settlements. The population in the communities do not speak Norwegian, and do not have a road connection to Longyearbyen. This made it difficult for the Governor to give accurate and detailed information. Issues were <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> erroneous reports in Russian media that there were five survivors. The Governor's cabin in Barentsburg was manned during the aftermath, and bulletins were distributed with updated information in Russian. The accident was one of the triggers causing Arktikugol to abandon Pyramiden in 1998.|$|E
50|$|Initially, Siria's {{songs were}} {{commonly}} mislabeled as Cascada's, due to Manian's production and Horler's vocals leading to similarity in musical style. This was <b>complicated</b> <b>further</b> <b>by</b> {{the inclusion of}} Siria's first two singles on Cascada's second album Perfect Day.|$|R
5000|$|Banding and Bands With Other - A game {{mechanic}} {{that was}} eventually {{dropped from the}} game after Weatherlight, Legends <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> matters <b>by</b> creating creatures that banded only with creatures of a certain type. In essence, banding allowed multiple creatures to attack as a single unit, allowing the attacking player to decide how damage was distributed {{to his or her}} creatures, if the defending player blocked. Legends is the only set to feature the [...] "bands with other" [...] mechanic, {{with the exception of the}} Unhinged card Old Fogey.|$|R
50|$|Understandably, {{relationships}} between all exotics and the humans {{tend to be}} somewhat strained, although this manifests in different ways, and is <b>complicated</b> <b>further</b> <b>by</b> the exotics' metapsychic powers. Everything starts {{to come to a}} head when the members of group green arrive in the Pliocene.|$|R
5|$|The {{implementation}} of the immense task of reconstructing the country was accompanied by the struggle {{of the new government}} to acquire centralized authority, <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> the mistrust a considerable part of society held for the new regime and by disputes over Poland's postwar borders, which were not firmly established until mid-1945. In 1947 Soviet pressure caused the Polish government to reject the American-sponsored Marshall Plan, and to join the Soviet Union-dominated Comecon in 1949. The Soviet forces present engaged in plunder of the former eastern territories of Germany which were being transferred to Poland, stripping it of valuable industrial equipment, infrastructure and factories and sending them to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The storylines {{follow the}} three couples {{as they try}} to stay {{faithful}} to each other. They are held back by issues such as impotence, infidelity, and unplanned pregnancy. Their lives are <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> their jobs, money troubles, and moving in together. Bullen embellished the scripts with events from his own personal life. The directors and producers made additional contributions, with the intent to keep the fiction in the programme as true to life as possible. The series was filmed in Greater Manchester {{in the first half of}} 1998, using Granada Television's studios, and exterior locations.|$|E
5|$|This {{major change}} from a Classical design to a far more complex revival style, little known in Russia, meant Vorontsov had to find an {{alternative}} architect to execute a new design. This was <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> Vorontsov's desire to not only have a loose Jacobean style, but also to incorporate motifs from Islamic architecture so as to highlight the oriental strain evident in the Khan's Palace, Enikale Fort, and other local Tatar architecture. The resulting design was to highlight the Crimea's position {{as a place where}} the East and West meet. It was a radical departure from the Neoclassical strain that dominated the Russian architecture of the period.|$|E

The case is <b>complicated</b> <b>further</b> <b>by</b> the client's refusal to exonerate himself.|$|R
25|$|Sexuality is a {{basis of}} health {{discrimination}} and inequity throughout the world. Homosexual, bisexual, transgender, and gender-variant populations around the world experience a range of health problems related to their sexuality and gender identity, Retrieved September 30, 2017. {{some of which are}} <b>complicated</b> <b>further</b> <b>by</b> limited research.|$|R
5|$|Thomas Posey was {{appointed}} territorial Governor on March 3, 1813, and served until the state's first Governor was sworn into office on November 7, 1816. Posey, who was age sixty-two and in poor health, {{had created a}} rift {{in the politics of}} the territory by refusing to reside in the capital of Corydon, instead living in Jeffersonville to be closer to his doctor. He <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> matters <b>by</b> being a supporter of slavery, much to the chagrin of opponents like Jennings, Dennis Pennington, and others who dominated the Territorial Legislature, and who sought to use the bid for statehood to permanently end the possibility of slavery in the state.|$|R
5|$|Wagner's {{writings}} on Jews, including Jewishness in Music, corresponded to some existing trends of thought in Germany during the 19th century; however, despite his very public views on these themes, {{throughout his life}} Wagner had Jewish friends, colleagues and supporters. There have been frequent suggestions that antisemitic stereotypes are represented in Wagner's operas. The characters of Mime in the Ring, Sixtus Beckmesser in Die Meistersinger, and Klingsor in Parsifal are sometimes claimed as Jewish representations, though they are not identified as such in the librettos of these operas. The topic of Wagner and the Jews is <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> allegations, {{which may have been}} credited by Wagner, that he himself was of Jewish ancestry, via his supposed father Geyer.|$|E
5|$|According to the Mexican authorities, {{the murder}} plot was {{possibly}} {{carried out with}} the collaboration of the Tijuana Cartel because no security measures were taken during the party and because the entrances were {{open to the public}} (when they are usually closed for private events). The investigation was <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> {{the fact that many of}} the invitees—fearing for their lives—fled from the scene when Francisco Rafael was killed by the clown. Out of the 80 to 100 attendees, only 20 of them stayed, many of them family members and employees of the banquet hall. When the authorities interrogated those who stayed and asked them whether they had recognized the assassin or any other physical features, none of them were able to give any details. Some stated that they did not even pay attention to the clown when he entered the crime scene, while others stated that they did not even recall exactly what the clown was wearing, remembering only that the assassin was wearing a blue-stripped or purple shirt, a multicolored wig, and a red clown nose.|$|E
5|$|Curing {{the leaks}} and {{cleaning}} up the contamination delayed the tunnel's completion by a year, and it was finally opened on 22 August 1999. The entire process was <b>further</b> <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the Scandinavian Rock Group. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during the incidents, which should have been addressed in 1995, but were never taken seriously. Compensation was paid for approximately 60 houses which were damaged {{as a result of}} tunnel construction. An evaluation by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was spent fixing the leaks, but the report claimed that this was to a large extent a waste of money, resulting from inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the construction of the entire railway. In total the extraordinary additional costs for the tunnel totaled NOK1.3 billion.|$|E
40|$|Glycans are {{chains of}} monosaccharides {{also known as}} oligosaccharides. Since glycans consist of monosaccharides having {{multiple}} hydroxyl groups which bind with potentially multiple other monosac-charides, glycans have very complicated structures compared to nucleic acid or protein sequences.

30|$|In real rock formations, the {{flattening}} effect {{observed in}} the simulation on the ductile rock and caused by plastic deformation of asperities could be further enhanced by shear displacement under stress that may further smooth the fracture faces out by shearing the asperities off. The gouge (pieces of broken rock) produced during such slip may <b>further</b> <b>complicate</b> the picture <b>by</b> blocking the flow in the fracture and thereby reducing the fracture permeability (Lorenz 1999; Smart et al. 2001).|$|R
