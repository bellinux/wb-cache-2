40|$|For hybrid {{integration}} of an optical <b>chip</b> with an <b>electronic</b> <b>chip</b> containing photo-diodes and processing electronics, light must be coupled from the optical to the <b>electronic</b> <b>chip.</b> This paper presents {{a method to}} fabricate quasi-total-internal-reflecting mirrors on an optical chip, placed at an angle of 45 ° with the chip surface, that enable 90 ° out-of-plane light coupling between flip-chip bonded chips. The fabrication method utilizes a metal-free, parallel process and is fully compatible with conventional fabrication of optical chips. The mirrors are created using anisotropic etching of 45 ° facets in a Si substrate, followed by fabrication of the optical structures. After removal of the mirror-defining Si structures by isotropic etching, the obtained interfaces between optical structure and air direct the output from optical waveguides to out-of-plane photo-detectors on the <b>electronic</b> <b>chip,</b> which is aimed to be flip-chip mounted on the optical chip.

50|$|When {{liquid coolant}} {{undergoes}} {{a change in}} phase due to the absorption of heat from a heated solid surface, a higher transfer rate occurs.
