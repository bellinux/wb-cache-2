25|$|On 10 April 1995, The American Reporter {{became the}} first daily Internet-based newspaper, with its own paid reporters {{around the world and}} all-original content. The {{editor-in-chief}} and founder <b>is</b> <b>Joe</b> Shea. The site is owned by 400 journalists. The future of newspapers in countries with high levels of Internet access has been widely debated as the industry has faced down soaring newsprint prices, slumping ad sales, the loss of much classified advertising to Craiglist, eBay and other websites, and precipitous drops in circulation. In the late 1990s the number of newspapers slated for closure, bankruptcy or severe cutbacks has risen—especially in the United States, where the industry has shed a fifth of its journalists since 2001. Revenue has plunged while competition from internet media has squeezed older print publishers.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{have long}} admired the playwright's suspenseful {{handling}} of the Keller family's burden in the play All My Sons. The critical character in this work <b>is</b> <b>Joe</b> Keller, who permitted defective parts to remain in warplanes that subsequently crash. Not only does Joe Keller fail to recognize his social responsibility, but also he allows his business partner to take the blame and serve the prison term for the crime. Gradually, events combine to strip Keller of his rationalizations. He argues that he never believed that the cracked engine heads would be installed and that he never admitted his mistake {{because it would have}} driven him out of business at the age of sixty-one, when he would not have another chance to “make something” for his family, his highest priority. Joe's irresponsibility is exposed through his son's questioning of his very humanity. Joe's suicide results from the tremendous guilt and self-awareness that arises during the play.|$|E

500|$|Carey re-recorded her vocals for the song's main remix titled [...] "Thank God I Found You" [...] (Make It Last Remix).
