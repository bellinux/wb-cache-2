5|$|After {{returning}} to New York on 31 May {{by way of}} Reykjavík and Halifax, West Cheswald made a brief trip to Philadelphia and back before she worked <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the East Coast to Norfolk, Virginia, where she arrived on 17 June. Sailing the next day, the cargo ship began {{the first of two}} African trips, during which she made many of the same ports as in her two 1941 voyages. On the homeward leg of her second voyage, she called at Takoradi and Freetown on the western coast of Africa in March 1943. After {{returning to}} the Americas, West Cheswald visited Saint Thomas, San Juan, and Mayagüez in the Caribbean before returning to Philadelphia on 28 April.|$|E
5|$|Laid up at Chatham {{during the}} years of peace, Bellerophon was not {{commissioned}} until July 1790, when the crisis known as the Spanish Armament broke out. As war with Spain threatened, warships lying in ordinary began to be commissioned and fitted for sea. Bellerophons first commander, Captain Thomas Pasley, arrived on 19 July and began the process of preparing her for service. After a month spent fitting out the ship with guns, masts, stores and rigging, and recruiting a crew, Pasley gave the orders for his crew to slip the moorings on 16 August, and Bellerophon made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the Medway to the fleet anchorage at the Nore.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} was filmed {{for the song}} and {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas. There are {{two versions of the}} video— one intercut with clips from the ABC series Dirty Sexy Money and created to promote the show, and another which is the official video. The video is set in a mansion, and starts with Gaga making <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> a hallway with several people who are either walking behind her, holding an umbrella over her, dancing in front of her, or tossing dollar bills around her. Gaga and company are then featured in many repeatedly-changing shots at various locations in the mansion. She is seen lying seductively on a table covered with money, crawling along a black grand piano and striking the keys with her leg several times, dancing around and later making out with a statue, and dancing in an elevator solo. There are also several close-up shots of her burning money and later stuffing it into her mouth. Over the course of the video, she undergoes numerous costume changes. Singer-songwriter Space Cowboy is also shown, most notably in scenes where he climbs a wall.|$|E
50|$|In December 1863, Emmeline made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> to Concord, NC {{when the}} Federals took Kinston. She finally worked <b>her</b> <b>way</b> back <b>down</b> {{to the coast}} and her home near Morehead City.|$|R

5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game takes place underwater. Some pools are inhabited by piranhas that can kill Lara within seconds, while others have streams with currents that can pull her in a fixed direction, preventing the player from being able to swim back or grab onto a ledge. Furthermore, the water in the Antarctica levels is too cold for Lara to swim through {{for more than a few}} seconds. The player can also wade through quicksand, but at the risk of drowning Lara. Some levels require the player to use vehicles. For example, the kayak helps Lara fight <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> rapids in the Madubu Gorge level, while an underwater propeller unit allows her to explore deep water areas in the Lud's Gate level. Other vehicles include a quad bike, a boat, and minecarts. Flares may be used to explore darkened areas. Ammunition, flares, and health recovery items are dispersed among the levels to help players increase their resources. The game also features a tutorial level where the player can practice Lara's moves and combat abilities.|$|E
25|$|Decatur {{transferred}} back to United States by June 1800; {{with extra}} guns and sails and improved structure the refurbished ship made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the Delaware River. Aboard ship {{at this time}} were Decatur's former classmates Lieutenant Charles Stewart and Midshipman Richard Somers, along with Lieutenant James Barron.|$|E
25|$|In 1934 the new liner was {{launched}} by Queen Mary as RMS Queen Mary. On <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the slipway, Queen Mary was slowed by eighteen drag chains, which checked the liner's progress into the River Clyde, {{a portion of}} which had been widened to accommodate the launch.|$|E
60|$|He made no answer. She {{lifted her}} skirts a little, for the dew was {{becoming}} heavier, and made <b>her</b> graceful <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the slope {{and across the}} bridge to the postern gate. Arrived there, she looked round. David Thain had vanished back into the grove.|$|R

He never attempted to make love to her again, utterly disappointing the hopes of Lady de Courcy, Mrs Proudie, and Lady Clandidlem.|$|R
25|$|Like {{her sister}} ships Pennsylvania and Ohio, Illinois {{also had an}} eventful first year of operation. In April 1874, she was making <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the Delaware River when, just {{opposite}} the Philadelphia Naval Yard, she encountered four canal boats coming in the opposite direction. Illinois promptly collided with and sank all four vessels in short order. Fortunately, no lives were lost, and the hull of Illinois was undamaged by the collisions, enabling her to continue the voyage to Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|When {{the bodies}} {{had been laid}} out on the stone floor, Lassie, a {{crossbred}} collie owned by the pub owner, found <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> amongst the bodies, and she began to lick the face of one of the victims, Able Seaman John Cowan. She stayed beside him for more than half an hour, nuzzling him and keeping him warm with her fur. To everyone’s astonishment, Cowan eventually stirred. He was taken to hospital and went on to make a full recovery. He visited Lassie again when he returned to thank all who saved his life.|$|E
25|$|Atratos {{maiden voyage}} began from Southampton on 17 January 1889. As {{well as her}} passengers, mails and a full cargo she carried in her strong room £120,000 in sovereigns, {{jewellery}} worth £2,000 and silver bars worth £400. She called at Carril, Vigo and Lisbon, and then crossed the Atlantic to South America. There she worked <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the east coast, calling at Pernambuco, Maceió, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, Montevideo and Buenos Aires. Magdalena, Thames and Clyde joined the same South American route over the next 18 months, but after her maiden voyage Atrato was switched to join Orinoco on RMSP's Caribbean route. All five sisters had long and successful careers.|$|E
60|$|They put a {{mattress}} under the Arkansan. Virginia {{did not leave}} him until he had fallen asleep, and a smile of peace was come upon his sunken face. Dismayed at the fearful sights about her, awed by the groans that rose on every side, she was choosing <b>her</b> <b>way</b> swiftly <b>down</b> the room to join her father and aunt in the carriage below.|$|R
60|$|The {{orders were}} obeyed, {{but it was}} evident that {{there was a lack of}} the usual briskness and willingness. However, before the ship had been many hours on <b>her</b> <b>way,</b> matters settled <b>down</b> and the work went on as usual.|$|R
50|$|In September 1920, Harron {{traveled}} from Los Angeles to New York by train to support Lillian Gish {{at the film}} premiere of <b>her</b> film <b>Way</b> <b>Down</b> East. He checked into the Hotel Seymour on September 1. He was also there for a preview of Coincidence and was sharing the hotel room with screenwriter and director Victor Heerman. Heerman also attended the preview and later said that the film was not well received.|$|R
25|$|On <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> {{the yellow}} brick road, Dorothy attends a banquet {{held by a}} Munchkin man named Boq. The next day, Dorothy frees the Scarecrow from the pole on which he is hanging, applies oil from a can to the rusted {{connections}} of the Tin Woodman, and meets the Cowardly Lion. The Scarecrow wants a brain, the Tin Woodman wants a heart, and the Cowardly Lion wants courage, so Dorothy encourages {{the three of them}} to journey with her and Toto to the Emerald City to ask for help from the Wizard. After several adventures, the travelers enter the gates of the Emerald City and meet the Guardian of the Gates, who asks them to wear green tinted spectacles to keep their eyes from being blinded by the city's brilliance. Each one is called to see the Wizard. The Wizard appears to Dorothy as a giant head on a marble throne, the Scarecrow as a lovely lady in silk gauze, the Tin Woodman as a terrible beast, and the Cowardly Lion as a ball of fire. The Wizard agrees to help them all if they kill the Wicked Witch of the West, who rules over Oz's Winkie Country. The Guardian warns them that no one has ever managed to defeat the witch.|$|E
500|$|A dark-haired {{woman is}} the sole {{survivor}} of a car crash on Mulholland Drive, a winding road high in the Hollywood Hills. Injured and in shock, she makes <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> into Los Angeles and sneaks into an apartment. Later that morning, an aspiring actress named Betty Elms arrives at the apartment, which is normally occupied by her Aunt Ruth. Betty is startled to find the woman, who has amnesia and assumes the name [...] "Rita" [...] after seeing a poster for the film Gilda starring Rita Hayworth. To help the woman remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds {{a large amount of}} money and an unusual blue key.|$|E
500|$|The section {{begins with}} Gaga wearing the tentacle dress, {{performing}} [...] "Partynauseous" [...] and [...] "Paparazzi" [...] with some ambient and quiet music. As she makes <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the runways, her dancers bring the [...] "Monster Paw Chair" [...] {{and puts it}} on one of the small stages. There Gaga sings [...] "Do What U Want" [...] and near the end she reaches for the piano to perform [...] "Dope" [...] and an acoustic version of [...] "Born This Way". A speech ensues, which is followed by [...] "Jewels n' Drugs", as Gaga disappears beneath the stage. A video interlude starts showing the singer dancing. Gaga rises from the stage, near the piano, wearing a black latex dress and green wig, to sing the chorus of [...] "Jewels n' Drugs".|$|E
50|$|Captain Peter Cameron {{left the}} Downs on 28 May 1818, bound for Bengal and Madras. On 14 September General Hewett {{arrived at the}} New Anchorage, Calcutta. As she made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> back <b>down</b> the coast, she reached Coninga on 30 December, and then Madras on 9 January 1819. Homeward bound, she reached Colombo on 28 February, Port Louis on 13 April, and St Helena on 30 June. She arrived at Long Reach on September.|$|R
50|$|Brenda (Julie Fernandez): Brenda {{naturally}} {{brings out}} the worst in Brent; she is not impressed by his patronising behaviour. She highlights the gap between Brent's vision {{of himself as a}} modern enlightened man and the reality of his ignorance and thoughtlessness. She uses a wheelchair, which results in her being stranded on a stairwell during a fire drill when David and Gareth decide they can't be bothered carrying <b>her</b> all the <b>way</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
50|$|By {{the start}} of the 1950s Martha too seems to have had her day; {{appreciation}} for her designs tapers off and her reputation falls. Those she has alienated on the way up are only too happy to watch <b>her</b> on the <b>way</b> <b>down.</b> Meanwhile Alison, having waited for her own chance, seizes the opportunity to present her own designs which are acclaimed as fresh, innovative and contemporary. Alison is in, Martha is out, and the cycle begins again.|$|R
500|$|Myst Online {{takes place}} in fictitious caverns below Earth's surface. Thousands of years ago, a race known as the D'ni practiced a craft known as The Art. By writing special books {{describing}} a location, the D'ni created a link to that world. The D'ni had their own number system and language distinct from the humans dwelling above them. According to the story, though the D'ni society crumbled (shortly after their first contact with a human who found <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> from the surface, and whose presence triggered a cultural collapse), archeologists much later discovered the caverns and teamed with a development studio (Cyan Worlds) to produce educational video games based on their findings; thus, {{the story in the}} Myst games is canonically findings from the caverns. New content and additions to the story were revealed through [...] "episodes".|$|E
500|$|By late May, UB-3 {{had made}} <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the Adriatic to the Austro–Hungarian port of Cattaro, the {{base from which}} most boats of the Pola Flotilla {{actually}} operated. For her first patrol, UB-3 was loaded with ammunition for Turkish forces at İzmir, Turkey. Because of her limited range, UB-3 was towed by the light cruiser SMS Novara of the Austro-Hungarian Navy through the Straits of Otranto and cast off near the island of Kérkira. UB-3s planned route was south of the Ionian Islands, around the Peloponnese, through the Cyclades, north around Khios and Karaburun, and into the Gulf of İzmir. If all went well, UB-3 would have arrived at İzmir on 28 or 29 May with about half her fuel left. The Germans received a garbled radio message from UB-3 {{when she was about}} [...] from İzmir, but were unable to completely understand it. No trace of UB-3 has ever been found. UB-3 {{was the first of the}} UB I boats to be lost during the war.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Tik Tok" [...] was {{directed}} by Syndrome. It was shot in Kesha's old neighborhood and the car featured in the video belongs to her. Kesha explained the experience saying, [...] "the video I'm excited about because I actually got to shoot it in my old neighborhood and the guy driving my gold car {{is a friend of}} mine". The video's party scene was shot in her friend's house, which they refer to as the [...] "drunk tank". The singer said [...] "the last party scene is in this house called the drunk tank, which is one of my friend's houses that we all go party at. So I like it cause its super-honest and genuine." [...] The video begins with Kesha waking in a bathtub in a home as she stumbles out and begins to look for a toothbrush in the restroom. She makes <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> a staircase looking at the pictures lining the wall. Kesha makes her way to the kitchen and walks in on a family who are having breakfast, startling them. She shrugs and then leaves the home as the family gets up and follows her. When she arrives at the sidewalk, she picks up a gold bicycle lying against a fallen fence and rides off. Kesha meets a group of children and trades the bicycle for their boombox. The video cuts to another scene where she rejects a guy and is picked up by a man portrayed by Simon Rex who drives her in a gold 1978 Trans Am. They are pulled over by the police, who handcuff Kesha. The scene then pans to her singing while standing in the T-top as she dangles the handcuffs hanging from her left arm. The next scene shows Kesha in an empty room filled with glitter. She then attends a party with Rex for the final scene. The video comes to an end with Kesha lying in a different bathtub from the one she woke up in. The official music video has received over 360 million views on YouTube as of July 2017.|$|E

A large party of Steam Packet Company directors had travelled to Ardrossan {{on board the}} Tynwald and joined the Ben-my-Chree at Greenock. Slipping her moorings, the Ben-my-Chree made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the Clyde to a point a few miles above the Cumbrae Lighthouse, gathering full speed as she went.

Trigger ran at [...] or more for 17 hours as six escorts dogged her trail and rained down numerous depth charges. Six exploded extremely close. When the submarine surfaced, her forward torpedo room was flooded to her deck plates, and the hull air induction and most compartments were in about the same condition. The bow planes, trim pump, sound gear, and both radars were all dead. Her radio antenna was grounded, and the submarine could not transmit. The crew spent the next four days making repairs [...] "by use of spares, baling wire, and considerable ingenuity." ...|$|E

She had thought to walk home along shady paths and cool off, but now she must run faster than ever, for she must know if Farmer Brown's boy had found her house.|$|R
60|$|The {{first hour}} of her search {{strengthened}} the sincere sense of gratitude {{with which she}} remembered the bookseller's kindness. To keep her attention steadily fixed on the one subject that interested her employer, and {{to resist the temptation}} to read those miscellaneous items of news which especially interest women, put her patience and resolution to a merciless test. Happily for herself, her neighbors on either side were no idlers. To see them so absorbed over their work that they never once looked at her, after the first moment when she took her place between them, was to find exactly the example of which she stood most in need. As the hours wore on, she pursued <b>her</b> weary <b>way,</b> <b>down</b> one column and up another, resigned at least (if not quite reconciled yet) to her task. Her labors ended, for the day, with such encouragement as she might derive from the conviction of having, thus far, honestly pursued a useless search.|$|R

She tears a strip of silk from her slip and ties it round the scratch. She goes back to the house and this time gets some tablets. She takes a few on <b>her</b> <b>way</b> back <b>down</b> the garden. When she reaches the viaduct she decides to head further down near the Rock and takes some more on the way.
