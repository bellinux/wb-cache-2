40|$|Nowadays, {{the breast}} cancer, over ahead of stomach one, holds the highest cancer {{incidence}} rate among Japanese women. Detection {{of breast cancer}} is done by palpation diagnosis, which require doctor to have highly experi-enced technique. In this study, we develop a palpation simulator which forms a woman’s actual breast model holding active controlled variable stiffness property. A pneumatic parallel manipulator is employed as mechan-ical part of our simulator. In order to display a concrete stiffness feeling to human (doctor), control strategy is proposed where the contact point is detected using an idea of <b>graphical</b> <b>intersection</b> test. A reference stiffness is realized by constructing a compliance control system. By regulating the reference stiffness value according to the contact point, a palpation motion is executed. The validity of the proposed palpation system are confirmed through some experiments and analysis...|$|E
40|$|The Capacity Spectrum Method (CSM), a performance-based seismic {{analysis}} technique, can be {{used for}} a variety of purposes such as rapid evaluation of a large inventory of buildings, design verification for new construction of individual buildings, evaluation of an existing structure to identify damage states, and correlation of damage states of buildings to various amplitudes of ground motion. The procedure compares the capacity of the structure (in the form of a pushover curve) with the demands on the structure (in the form of response spectra). The <b>graphical</b> <b>intersection</b> of the two curves approximates the response of the structure. In order to account for non-linear inelastic behavior of the structural system, effective viscous damping values are applied to linear-elastic response spectra similar to inelastic response spectra. The paper summarizes the development of the CSM from the 1970 s to the present and includes discussions on modifications presented by other researchers, as well as recommendations by the author...|$|E
40|$|The {{individual}} processes {{involved in}} interstitial fluid volume and protein regulation (microvascular filtration, lymphatic return, and interstitial storage) are relatively simple, yet their interaction is exceedingly complex. There is a notable lack of a first-order, algebraic formula that relates interstitial fluid pressure and protein to critical parameters commonly used to characterize the movement of interstitial fluid and protein. Therefore, {{the purpose of the}} present study is to develop a simple, transparent, and general algebraic approach that predicts interstitial fluid pressure (Pi) and protein concentrations (Ci) that takes into consideration all three processes. Eight standard equations characterizing fluid and protein flux were solved simultaneously to yield algebraic equations for Pi and Ci as functions of parameters characterizing microvascular, interstitial, and lymphatic function. Equilibrium values of Pi and Ci arise as balance points from the <b>graphical</b> <b>intersection</b> of transmicrovascular and lymph flows (analogous to Guyton's classical cardiac output-venous return curves). This approach goes beyond describing interstitial fluid balance in terms of conservation of mass by introducing the concept of inflow and outflow resistances. Algebraic solutions demonstrate that Pi and Ci result from a ratio of the microvascular filtration coefficient (1 /inflow resistance) and effective lymphatic resistance (outflow resistance), and Pi is unaffected by interstitial compliance. These simple algebraic solutions predict Pi and Ci that are consistent with reported measurements. The present work therefore presents a simple, transparent, and general balance point characterization of interstitial fluid balance resulting from the interaction of microvascular, interstitial, and lymphatic function...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the reproductive biology of Oreochromis niloticus broodstock of known age structure and spawning history {{with the aim of}} synchronising and controlling their spawning for mass fry production. Hatchery reared stock was subjected to a constant photoperiod of 12 L: 12 D and maintained at 27 ± 1 °C. All stock was fed on commercial trout pellets. The feeding frequency and protein content of the diet varied depending on fish size. Oocyte development was classified into 6 stages including that of atresia based on histology. In order to quantify ovarian maturity, three stereological methods were compared. The ovarian volume fractions of different oocyte stages estimated by the mass, <b>graphical</b> and <b>intersection</b> methods showed homogeneous results. The intersection method required less time (2. 6 mins/sample) whereas the others needed 11 - 12 mins/sample. In addition, the numerical density technique employing the intersection method was used and yielded similar oocyte estimates to those derived from the Gilson's fluid method. Onset of sexual differentiation was influenced by the stocking densities. At 10 and 20 fry/l, 30 and 45...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePresence of multi-oriented characters, {{connected}} {{characters with}} <b>graphical</b> lines, <b>intersection</b> of text and symbols with graphical lines/curves etc. are {{very common in}} graphical documents. As a result word spotting in graphical documents is still a challenging task {{that we try to}} solve (partially) in this paper. The proposed approach proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, recognition of isolated components is done using rotation invariant features and an SVM classifier. The characters having good recognition score and match in the query string are first selected for initial spotting. Because of structural complexity of graphical documents as well as of touching components, we may miss some of the query characters during initial spotting in some documents. In that case, based on the position, size and orientation of the recognized characters in the input document image, regions where missing characters may be located (candidate regions) are defined. In the second stage, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is used to find those missing characters in the candidate regions for possible spotting. Finally, using the position, size, orientation as well as intercharacter gap information of the recognized components, spotting is validated. Experimental results demonstrate that the method is efficient to locate a query word in multi-oriented and/or touching graphical documents...|$|R
