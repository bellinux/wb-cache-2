5|$|The story {{opens with}} a lengthy {{explanation}} of ratiocination. Dupin demonstrates his prowess by deducing his companion's thoughts as if through apparent supernatural power. The story then turns to the baffling double murder of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter at their home in the Rue Morgue, a fictional street in Paris. According to newspaper accounts, the mother {{was found in a}} yard behind the house, with multiple broken bones and her throat so deeply cut that her head fell off when the body was moved. The daughter was found strangled to death and stuffed upside down into a chimney. The murders occurred in a fourth-floor room that was locked from the inside; on the floor were found a bloody straight razor, several bloody tufts of <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> and two bags of gold coins. Several witnesses reported hearing two voices {{at the time of the}} murder, one male and French, but disagreed on the language spoken by the other. The speech was unclear, and every witness admits that he does not know the language he claims to have heard.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{begins to}} insult Lois about her {{advancing}} age, including her minor strands of <b>gray</b> <b>hair.</b> This makes her extremely self-conscious, and soon Lois {{becomes aware of}} her lust for a younger man. After introducing her new boyfriend, Anthony, to the family, Meg goes on to make out {{with him on the}} family couch, with Lois watching over nearby. Jealous of her daughter's new-found love, she begins hitting on Anthony. Later that day, Lois sends Meg to pick up her grandfather, leaving her all alone with Anthony. The two then begin making out on the couch, but Meg returns to the house only a few moments later and discovers them. Angry at her mother for ruining her chance at having a normal boyfriend, Meg threatens Lois to lay off of him, pulling out one of her own teeth in frustration. Lois quickly agrees, but is still angry with Peter for continually insulting her. She confronts him about this, and he admits that he was actually embarrassed about his own advancing age, as well as his lack of fitness, and was only insulting Lois in order to distract her from the fact that she could be with a much better-looking man. He apologizes for his behavior, and Lois forgives him.|$|E

Davidson concludes that, in these examples, [...] "here we have the fierce destructive side of death, with a strong emphasis on its physical horrors, so perhaps we should not assume that the gruesome figure of Hel is wholly Snorri's literary invention." ...|$|E
500|$|Hawks's directorial {{style and}} the use of natural, {{conversational}} dialogue in his films are cited as major influences on many noted filmmakers, including Robert Altman, John Carpenter, and Quentin Tarantino. His work is also admired by many notable directors including Peter Bogdanovich, Martin Scorsese, François Truffaut, Michael Mann and Jacques Rivette. Jean-Luc Godard called him [...] "the greatest American artist." [...] Critic Leonard Maltin labeled Hawks [...] "the greatest American director who is not a household name." [...] Andrew Sarris in his influential book of film criticism The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929–1968 included Hawks in the [...] "pantheon" [...] of the 14 greatest film directors who had worked in the United States. Brian De Palma dedicated his version of Scarface to Hawks and Ben Hecht. Hawks was nicknamed [...] "The Gray Fox" [...] by members of the Hollywood community, thanks to his prematurely <b>gray</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
500|$|Warwick Davis played Filius Flitwick in {{the first}} two films as an old dwarf-like man with <b>gray</b> <b>hair.</b> In {{pre-production}} for the third film, the producers told Davis there was no role for Flitwick, but {{that they would like to}} have him play somebody else, at least for a cameo. Davis played a much younger-looking man with black hair and a moustache who directed the choir at the Hogwarts Welcome Feast, and was credited as portraying [...] "Wizard". During pre-production for the fourth film, director Mike Newell told Davis he wanted to keep his look from the last film but make this the new look for Flitwick. Davis now considers the character he has played some relative of Flitwick, though he is still credited as [...] "Filius Flitwick". In the sixth film, Harry specifically calls him Professor Flitwick, as does McGonagall in the seventh, calling him Filius.|$|E

500|$|On July 16, 1999, tragedy {{struck the}} Kennedy family again when [...] John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s [...] Piper Saratoga light {{aircraft}} {{crashed into the}} Atlantic Ocean {{off the coast of}} Martha's Vineyard. The accident killed Kennedy, his wife, and sister-in-law. As patriarch, Ted consoled his extended family along with President Clinton at the public memorial service. He paraphrased William Butler Yeats by saying of his nephew: [...] "We dared to think, in that other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would live to comb <b>gray</b> <b>hair,</b> with his beloved Carolyn by his side. But like his father, he had every gift but length of years." [...] Ted now served as a role model for Maria Shriver, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Joseph Patrick Kennedy II, and other family members. The Boston Globe wrote of the changed role: [...] "It underscored the evolution that surprised so many people who knew the Kennedys: Teddy, the baby of the family, who had grown into a man who could sometimes be dissolute and reckless, had become the steady, indispensable patriarch, the one the family turned to in good times and bad." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{horse race}} that Smith {{witnessed}} live was the 1885 Kentucky Derby in which Joe Cotton was the favorite and won at 4:5 odds, {{but he did}} not bet on the outcome. Smith decided that the best gambling prospects at the time were in Chicago and made his way to William [...] "Silver Bill" [...] Riley's poolroom in late 1885. Riley was a Civil War veteran from Brooklyn with prematurely <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> that owned one of the first clubs in Chicago dedicated to betting on horse racing. It was Riley that saddled Smith with the nickname [...] "Pittsburgh Phil" [...] on their first meeting to differentiate George Smith's bets {{from the rest of the}} [...] "room full of Smiths." [...] Riley usually named his customers based on their appearances, but by McGill's reckoning he chose the name [...] "Pittsburgh Phil" [...] because Smith was from Pittsburgh and Phil was short for Philadelphia. Smith quickly gained a reputation as being one of the most successful [...] "plungers", or men that bet large sums of money on races, in Chicago. Within a few years, he relocated to New York City and focused most of his betting operations out of New York tracks.|$|E
500|$|The South Park creators and animators {{said they}} were still {{developing}} the characters {{and trying to figure}} out the future direction of the show with [...] "Weight Gain 4000", which was more slow-paced than the series would eventually become. The 30-page script was shorter than in later episodes, which would average between 45 to 50 pages. The child protagonists also spoke slower. While recording their voice performances, the actors read the lines slowly and the dialogue was then sped up to create the characters' distinctive voices. At that time, Parker and Stone had not mastered the pace at which they needed to speak. The crowd shots in [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] took a particularly long time to animate due to the large number of people featured, and the animators were especially proud of the use of depth and motion in the perspective of the crosshairs in Mr. Garrison's rifle scope as he tried to assassinate Kathie Lee Gifford. Mr. Garrison's hatred for Gifford was foreshadowed in [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", where the sentence [...] "I'm not positive, but I think Cathy [...] Lee Gifford is much older than she claims to be", can be seen on his classroom's chalkboard. During a flashback scene in [...] "Weight Gain 4000", an eight-year-old Mr. Garrison is shown to already be bald on top with <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> on the side of his ears. This led to an inconsistency in the first season episode [...] "Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut", in which he has a full head of hair during a flashback.|$|E

He was called the [...] "Silver Fox" [...] due to his prematurely <b>gray</b> <b>hair</b> which he kept in a neatly trimmed crew cut. In 1952, Stephens arrived at Edwards Air Force Base, California to serve as Chief of Fighter Operations. From 1963 to 1968, he served as test director of the YF-12 and SR-71 test force. He was the first military pilot to fly the YF-12A interceptor and the SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
