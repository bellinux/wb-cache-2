5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the Wootton Hall is its pair of Italian black and Beschia marble blackamoor torchères, originally given to the First Duke of Marlborough as a present from General Charles Churchill. In exceptionally good condition, they stand {{either side of the}} <b>door</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Saloon. These were discovered in the silt of the River Tiber and are depictions of slaves who once served in a Roman household. Several flags stand above them, including the White Ensign. The ceiling is intricately made, featuring flowers in the plaster, each one different, the work of Colen Campbell in the early 18th century. The black and white check marble floor is also a distinguishing {{feature of the}} room, but through most of its history this floor would have been left plain as horses and carriages would enter the hall inside. In the mid 19th century Frederick, the 4th Earl, had laid down brown and blue tiles, replaced by the marble floor which was added by his son Robert in around 1910. The floor gives significant depth to the hall and provides fine acoustics, so much that Diana would once practice her tap dancing in the hall as a teenager.|$|E
25|$|In The Hobbit, {{the writing}} on the map that Gandalf had {{received}} from Thráin II mentioned Durin's Day. It predicted that on Durin's Day the last light of the Sun as night fell would reveal the secret <b>door</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Lonely Mountain.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an episode}} of Bear Behaving Badly which is a parody of the Harry Potter series, in which Nev the Bear is transported through a magic <b>door</b> <b>into</b> <b>The</b> School of Magic And Magic Stuff. The major {{characters}} of the series are then parodies of characters from the Harry Potter franchise; Nev is Nevvy Potter, Crazy Keith is Keithione, Dorris is Ronnis, Aunt Barbra is Bagrid, Postie is Poochie, and Mr Prank is Valdiprank.|$|E

25|$|These Orlit {{structures}} were {{split into two}} sections. The entrance door led into the smaller roofed section which {{was used as a}} shelter and store with a sliding <b>door</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> open section which housed the post instrument and chart on top of a wooden mounting. Two types of Orlit posts existed, the Orlit ‘A’ was at ground level and the Orlit ‘B’ was raised 6ft on four legs with a ladder for access.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Faber and Faber {{published}} {{his first major}} volume, called Death of a Naturalist. This collection was met with much critical acclaim and won several awards, including the Gregory Award for Young Writers and the Geoffrey Faber Prize. Also in 1966, Heaney was appointed as a lecturer in Modern English Literature at Queen's University Belfast. That year his first son, Michael, was born. A second son, Christopher, was born in 1968. That same year, with Michael Longley, Heaney {{took part in a}} reading tour called Room to Rhyme, which increased awareness of the poet's work. In 1969, his second major volume, <b>Door</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Dark, was published.|$|E
25|$|Privates Horrigan, John Williams, Joseph Williams {{and other}} {{patients}} {{tried to hold}} the hospital entrance with rifles and fixed bayonets. Joseph Williams defended a small window, and 14 dead Zulus were later found beneath that window. As it became clear {{the front of the}} building was being taken over by Zulus, John Williams began to hack a way of escape through the wall dividing the central room and a corner room {{in the back of the}} hospital. As he made a passable breach, the <b>door</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> central room came under furious attack from the Zulus, and he only had time to drag two bedridden patients out before the door gave way.|$|E

25|$|The teacher's {{house had}} three levels {{and apart from}} ornate {{external}} stone carving was similar in size and features to the workmen's cottages. The basement contained a storage cellar, pantry and space for a WC. As with the houses and school building it is not certain that any WC's were actually installed. The ground floor contained two living rooms, one with a sink, range and access to a private yard. An entrance hall opened to the stair hall. At the mezzanine landing of the stair was a <b>door</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> school corridor. On the first floor there were two bedrooms, each with a fireplace, and a smaller bedroom in the clock tower. Flues from the four fireplaces were carried to a single central chimney stack supported by an arch (hidden in the roof space) across the stair hall. This was unusual and expensive form of construction, but visually impressive.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of the Tent Room is drawn from the original use of striped fabric draped {{on the walls and}} hung in swaths from the ceiling in order to temporarily transform what was normally the tennis court into a dining hall. The room today has a wall covering of vertically sriped red and gold fabric with a padded backing, which rises to meet the same fabric hung in a swag fashion outwards from a single coffer in the centre of the ceiling and trimmed {{around the perimeter of the}} room with a scallop edged valence of simple passementerie and tassels. This gives the space an overall resemblance to the interior of a large tent. The west wall of the room is broken by series of windows, each paired with a double <b>door</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Long Gallery on the opposite wall, and between them a continuous frame and panel wainscotting. All this woodwork, including the door frames and other trim, is painted in a gloss white to contrast with the textured and patterned wall fabric.|$|E
25|$|St Paul's Anglican Cathedral, {{built in}} 1894 {{and the oldest}} church {{building}} in the city still in use, is a modest parish church {{on the periphery of}} the central business district whose parish dates from 1883. It has been the designated cathedral church of the Anglican Diocese of Qu'Appelle, comprising most of Southern Saskatchewan, since 1944 when it supplanted the original pro-cathedral of St Peter's in the eponymous town of Qu'Appelle. It was then assumed that St. Paul's would remain pro-cathedral temporarily and that plans would be fulfilled to build a substantial cathedral at the corner of College Avenue and Broad Street: the site remains obvious, with hedges planted about the planned building, its liturgical west end at the corner of the intersection. However, by 1974 the diocese reached the conclusion that this outcome was improbable, and St. Paul's Pro-Cathedral was designated Cathedral. Indeed, its organ console being on the liturgical and geographical south end of the choir, just inside the <b>door</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> chapel and the pipes on the north side, the choir was moved to the north transept with a new Casavant Frères organ, its two-manual console there and the pipes overhead. (The location of the organ console and the choir have changed a third time, now being in the north transept.) Its future cathedral status, however, is somewhat in doubt as the Anglican Church of Canada considers rationalising its increasingly top-heavy episcopal structure and, with decreasing numbers of active church people it being over equipped with that, with parish churches steadily decreasing in number.|$|E

Two white men, C. P. [...] "Poly" [...] Wilkerson and Henry Andrews, were killed; Wilkerson had kicked in the front door, and Andrews was behind him. At least four whites were wounded, one possibly fatally. The remaining children in the Carrier house were spirited out the back <b>door</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> woods. They crossed dirt roads one at a time, then hid under brush until they had all gathered away from Rosewood.|$|E

500|$|Throughout No. 36001's trials, the {{firebrick}} lining {{provided a}} constant problem by continually collapsing into the fire. The firebricks were then replaced with cast iron substitutes that melted in the intense {{heat of the}} firebox, which were in turn replaced by thicker [...] firebricks. Some of the firemen allotted to the Leader complained about cramped conditions in the centre cab of the locomotive, a situation made worse by flames entering the cab from the firebox at high outputs. It was an enclosed space that was constantly hot and the single fireman's entrance door {{on the side of}} the locomotive was left open during travel to promote ventilation. The <b>door</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fireman's cab also attracted criticism, as it would have been blocked in the event of the locomotive overturning on that side, preventing the fireman's escape, so that members of the railway trade union ASLEF threatened to stop their crews from operating the Leader.|$|E

The [...] "great and powerful Oz" [...] is actually Herman Smith, a failed politician from Atlantic City, New Jersey, who was transported to Oz when a balloon he was flying to promote his campaign to become the city dogcatcher was lost in a storm. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion are distraught that they will never receive their respective brain, heart, and courage, but Dorothy makes them realize that they already have had these things all along. Just as it seems as if she {{will never be able to}} get home, Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, appears and implores her to find her way home by searching within and using the magic of the silver slippers by clicking the heels together three times. After thanking Glinda and saying goodbye to her friends, she takes clicks her heels together three times. She is then back near home with Toto in her arms and walks into the apartment.|$|E
500|$|Not all Capitol hauntings {{are related}} to people who worked there. The [...] "Demon Cat" [...] is alleged to prowl the halls of Congress, and make {{appearances}} just before a national tragedy or change in Presidential administration. It was first seen {{in the early part}} of the 19th century, and a night watchman shot at it in 1862. It has also been seen by other night watchmen and members of the Capitol Police. It appeared before the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, the October 1929 stock market crash, and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The cat has not only been seen in the halls, but has repeatedly appeared in Washington's Tomb. The Tomb (two levels below the crypt beneath the Capitol Rotunda) was an original feature of the Capitol, planned as a resting place for George Washington and members of his family. The Washington family politely declined the offer. The Tomb stands empty, although from 1865 to 2009 (when it was moved to the United States Capitol Visitor Center) the Lincoln catafalque was stored there. The specters of at least two soldiers are also said to haunt the Capitol. A few eyewitnesses have claimed that whenever an individual lies in state in the Capitol Rotunda, a World War I doughboy momentarily appears, salutes, then disappears. A second apparition, which eyewitnesses say is the ghost of an American Revolutionary War soldier, has also appeared at the Washington Tomb. According to several stories, the soldier appears, moves around the Lincoln catafalque, and then passes out the <b>door</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hallway before disappearing.|$|E
