5|$|On 10 September 2007, Licciardello rang a {{talkback}} {{radio station}} {{pretending to be}} someone else, and complained about the stunt, claiming that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>stupid</b> and anyone involved at the ABC, including Kerry O'Brien, should be jailed for ten years. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode, and Licciardello said {{he wished he had}} made the call on the evening of the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down.|$|E
25|$|The terrorists {{from the}} second floor, from {{apartment}} number one, had a clear view {{from the window and}} we moved out, walked along the lawn without running or zigzagging but in strong and confident legs. Maybe <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>stupid</b> ? But we had done so....we left the apartment through the lawn.|$|E
500|$|Michael Schumacher, who was {{involved}} in the first lap incident, believed that the race should have been stopped. However, he praised the work of the marshals who had assisted to recover the cars involved. He also believed that Zonta had [...] "over-estimated his ability" [...] and said he would have a [...] "quiet word" [...] with the latter. Zonta believed that the incident was not his fault and that Michael Schumacher braked harder than him, but apologised for his retirement from the race. Fisichella also agreed that the race should have been stopped, saying, [...] "Three of the protagonists are out and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>stupid</b> not to red flag." [...] Benetton Technical Director Pat Symonds was highly critical of the driver's actions as he believed Benetton lost valuable points towards the Constructors' Championship. [...] "The driving antics of some of our competitors at the first corner were appalling and ruined the race not only for many of the drivers but also for many of the spectators" [...] he said.|$|E

6000|$|... "That is my opinion, too, Mike. We {{have had}} a good many rides with despatches, but between times <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>stupid</b> work, hanging about the general's {{quarters}} waiting for orders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I am glad I know {{something}} about <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>stupid</b> to <b>be</b> in a place, and know nothing of its history. You are rising in my estimation fast, Dr. Burke." ...|$|R
500|$|Chris Power of BBC Music {{compared}} Homework [...] "less-is-more" [...] {{approach to}} compression's use as [...] "a sonic tribute" [...] to the FM radio stations that [...] "fed Daft Punk's youthful obsessions." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "while a few tracks are more daft than deft," [...] more recent groundbreakers like The Avalanches could never exist without [...] "Da Funk". Ian Mathers of Stylus Magazine noted that [...] "there's {{a core of}} unimpeachably classic work on Homework, hidden among the merely good, and when you've got such a classic debut hidden in {{the outlines of the}} epic slouch of their debut, it's hard not to get frustrated." [...] Rolling Stone awarded the album three stars out of five, commenting that [...] "the duo's essential, career-defining insight is that the problem with disco the first time around was not that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>stupid</b> but that it was not stupid enough." [...] Rolling Stone ranked Homework at the top on their list of [...] "The 30 Greatest EDM Albums of All Time" [...] while affirming that Daft Punk's debut [...] "is pure synapse-tweaking brilliance." [...] According to Scott Woods of The Village Voice, [...] "Daft Punk [...] the lid off the [...] sewer" [...] with the release of Homework. Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork awarded it 7.6 out of 10. He stated that [...] "Homework provides sixteen whole tracks of modern-day boom box bass n' drum and unlike your science project, it doesn't require a lot of intricate calculations to figure out how it works." [...] In his view, [...] "It sounds like an Atari 2600 on a killing spree." [...] By contrast, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice cited [...] "Da Funk" [...] as a [...] "choice cut", indicating [...] "a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money". Darren Gawle from Drop-D Magazine also gave a negative review, stating that [...] "Homework is the work of a couple of DJs who sound amateurish at best." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schuldiner {{fired his}} manager Eric Greif after Spiritual Healing but settled and re-hired {{him before the}} {{recording}} of Human. Although {{there were at least}} two lawsuits between Greif and Schuldiner, Schuldiner was characteristically mellow in an interview with Thrash 'n Burn about what the writer referred to as his [...] "gruesome collaboration" [...] with Greif: [...] "We just {{came to the conclusion that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>stupid</b> just fighting all the time, taking each other to court and all that stupid shit." [...] "Fate has an interesting way of working these things out... Yes, we had a falling out, but we're working together again and it takes a lot of worries off my mind knowing Eric is the man for us", Schuldiner told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{some of the}} Beatles {{defended the}} use of the Butcher photograph. Lennon said that it was [...] "as {{relevant}} as Vietnam" [...] and McCartney said that their critics were [...] "soft". However, this opinion was not shared by all band members. George Harrison said in The Beatles Anthology that he thought the whole idea [...] "was gross, and I also thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>stupid.</b> Sometimes we all did stupid things thinking it was cool and hip when it was naïve and dumb; {{and that was one of}} them." [...] In 2007 George Martin, the Beatles' producer, recalled that the cover had been the cause of his first strong disagreement with the band. He added: [...] "I thought it was disgusting and in poor taste … It suggested that they were madmen. Which they were, but not in that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want him}} to have his notion, whether <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>stupid</b> or otherwise, before I see him. If you do not mind, papa, going to {{him as soon as}} possible, I shall be obliged to you." ...|$|R

For Kafui Attoh America's transit is "idiotic" in two ways: {{in the sense that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>stupid</b> to have not invested more in it, and in the way it isolates those unable to use cars, excluding them from urban public [...] ...|$|R

60|$|Therefore, I {{think that}} a young writer's upward course should be slow and beset with many obstacles, even hardships. Not that I believe in hardships as having {{inherent}} virtues; I think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>stupid</b> to regard them in that way; but they oftener bring out the virtues inherent in the sufferer from them than what I may call the 'softships'; and at least they stop him, and give him time to think.|$|R
6000|$|When a {{man says}} that {{democracy}} is false because most people <b>are</b> <b>stupid,</b> there <b>are</b> several courses which the philosopher may pursue. The most obvious is to hit him smartly and with precision on the exact tip of the nose. But if you have scruples (moral or physical) about this course, you may proceed to employ Reason, {{which in this case}} has all the savage solidity of a blow with the fist. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>stupid</b> to say that [...] "most people" [...] <b>are</b> <b>stupid.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> like saying [...] "most people are tall," [...] when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> obvious that [...] "tall" [...] can only mean taller than most people. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> absurd to denounce the majority of mankind as below the average of mankind.|$|R

6000|$|... "Why do you stop? You {{had almost}} feared that Versailles had been wasted upon me.

2500|$|Despite his stupidity, Baldrick {{delivers}} a profound speech while {{in preparation for}} the [...] "final push", tension is high, and Baldrick demands, [...] "Why can't we just stop sir?

[...] Neither Captain Blackadder nor Lieutenant George are {{able to come up with}} a good answer beyond an attempted accusation of defeatism from George.|$|R

5000|$|The play had {{its premiere}} in Korsh Theatre in Moscow on October 28, 1888. The Bear {{from the start}} was a success. In Chekhov's {{lifetime}} it brought in regular royalties, and <b>it</b> has constantly <b>been</b> revived on both professional and amateur stages worldwide since. Chekhov, who often referred to his own writing in self-deprecating ways, remarked on his success: [...] "I've managed to write a stupid vaudeville which, owing {{to the fact that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>stupid,</b> <b>is</b> enjoying surprising success." ...|$|R

60|$|Not {{long after}} breakfast, the earl {{went out on}} his horse, and met Owen at some gate or back entrance. In his opinion the old house <b>was</b> <b>stupid,</b> and the women in <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>stupid</b> companions in the morning. His heart for the moment was engaged on the thought of making his animal take the most {{impracticable}} leaps which he could find, {{and it did not}} occur to him at first to give his mother's message to his companion. As for lunch, they would get a biscuit and glass of cherry-brandy at Wat M'Carthy's, of Drumban; and as for his mother having anything to say, that of course went for nothing.|$|R
6000|$|Dick's {{mother and}} cousins laughed heartily, but he said, seriously, [...] "You are quite right, Uncle.

But I didn't feel gay any more. I says to myself I've botched my chances by that; I surely have, if he meets up with Hal Clayton.|$|E
6000|$|But the {{ordinance}} of departure {{with the ladies}} was one of which the sprite had no idea; Honor {{held out her hand}} for her; Aunt Sandbrook called her; her father put her down; she shook her curls, and said she should not leave father; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>stupid</b> up in the drawing-room, and she hated ladies, which confession set every one laughing, so as quite to annihilate the effect of Mr. Sandbrook's 'Yes, go, my dear.' ...|$|E
