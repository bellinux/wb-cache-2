40|$|Clearance leakage {{losses of}} axial {{compressor}} rotors and stators {{have a major}} impact on the overall compressor performance. The clearance heights in the last <b>stages</b> (<b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages)</b> of a gas turbine compressor are very large in comparison to the low <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> due to mechanical constraints and small blade heights. The reduction of clearance leakage losses in a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stage</b> still holds an important potential for the overall performance improvement at design point conditions.

40|$|Aims and Objectives. In this article, we {{aimed to}} explore the {{literature}} to ascertain what research evidence exists {{in relation to the}} identification of pressure injuries in people with dark skin tones. Background. Pressure injuries development has been widely researched and documented; however, much of this work does not address ethnicity or race and assumes Caucasian-ness. Thus, the perceptions of people with dark skin tones and the influence of skin pigmentation on identification and management of pressure injuries is under examined. Design. Literature review. Methods. A comprehensive electronic database search was undertaken of PubMed, Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane and British Nursing Index (BNI) between 1990 -July 2016. Alongside the electronic data, journals, books, papers from conferences, relevant national and international organisations and reference lists were also used to help source key studies. Results. A search of the literature revealed 11 relevant articles. The foci of studies included the following: risk of sustaining a pressure injuries based on skin tones, identification of pressure injuries amongst people with dark skin tones, pressure injuries and place of care and socio-economic impact on pressure injuries development. Overall, findings indicate that people with darker skin tones are more likely to develop <b>higher</b> <b>stage</b> <b>pressure</b> injuries. Reasons for this are not fully elucidated; however, it may be associated with current skin assessment protocols being less effective for people who have darker skin tones resulting in early damage arising from pressure not being recognised. Conclusion. From the literature reviewed, {{it can be seen that}} there is a lack of guidance and evidence, and people with darker skin tones are more likely in comparison with people presenting as Caucasian to develop <b>higher</b> <b>stage</b> <b>pressure</b> injuries.

40|$|The tip {{clearance}} flow within industrial axial compressor rows {{has a significant}} impact on compressor performance. This is especially the case in the later <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> which have a significantly shorter blade length and relatively larger {{tip clearance}} than the early <b>stages.</b> <b>Pressure</b> driven fluid leaks through the tip clearance producing losses and because of the short blading this is the largest source of loss in the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages.</b> Most tip clearance flow work and understanding focuses on the early stages which have smaller relative tip clearances and are similar to aero engines. This work strives to understand the physics behind these large tip clearance flows and how they can be managed to reduce losses increasing the efficiency of the machine. It would be desirable to use computational techniques to solve all flow feature problems within turbomachinery reducing time and cost. However these techniques have limited accuracy and rely on the expertise of the user to obtain the best result possible. For this reason experimental result are used to calibrate and understand the differences between the computational and real machines. 2. Why? The tip clearance is required because of the relative motion of the blade to the casing {{and they need to be}} large enough to cope with thermal expansions of the blades and casing at the most extreme operating conditions. Throughout the compressor the density of the working fluid is increased from stage to stage thus the volumetric flow rate decreases for the same mass flow rate. This means that the annulus cross sectional area has to be reduced to keep a reasonable axial velocity. An industrial axial machine has one shaft thus all of the blade rows in the compressor and turbine rotate at the same rotational velocity. Therefore in order to keep the tangential blade speed up to produce blade loading the radius has to be kept large. This means that the tip clearances in the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> are relatively large compared to the blade radius and can typically be six percent of the annulus height. Improving the flow through the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> will increase the efficiency and make the compressor more robust increasing the operating range postponing stall or surge...|$|R

Three casing treatment configurations were developed and incorporated in the shroud over the inducer of the impeller. The predicted performance of baseline compressor (without casing treatment) was in good agreement with published experimental data. The compressor with different inducer casing treatment geometries showed varying levels of stall margin improvement, up to a maximum of 18 %. While the peak efficiency of the compressor with casing treatment dropped by 0. 8 %– 1 % compared to the baseline compressor, the choke mass flow rate was improved by 9. 5 %, thus enhancing the total stable operating range.

Single-, two- and three-stage turbines are considered {{with the number of}} design variables increasing from 6 to 11 then to 15, in accordance with the number of stages. Due to its global nature and flexibility in handling different types of information, the response surface methodology (RSM) is applied in the present study. A major goal of the present Optimization effort is to balance the desire of maximizing aerodynamic performance and minimizing weight. To ascertain required predictive capability of the RSM, a two-level domain refinement approach has been adopted. The accuracy of the predicted optimal design points based on this strategy is shown to he satisfactory. Our investigation indicates that the efficiency rises quickly from single stage to 2 stages but that the increase is much less pronounced with 3 stages. A 1 -stage turbine performs poorly under the engine balance boundary condition. A portion of fluid kinetic energy is lost at the turbine discharge of the 1 -stage design due to <b>high</b> <b>stage</b> <b>pressure</b> ratio and high-energy content, mostly hydrogen, of the working fluid.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the use of {{aspiration}} on compressor blade design. The pressure ratio can be significantly increased by controlling the development of the blade and endwall boundary layers. This concept is validated through an aspirated fan stage experiment performed in the MIT Blowdown Compressor Facility. The fan stage was designed to produce a pressure ratio of 1. 6 at a throughflow adiabatic efficiency of 89 % at a rotor tip speed of 750 ft/s. Aspiration equal to 0. 5 % of the inlet flow was applied to the blade surface of both the rotor and stator. Aspiration was also used on the endwall boundary layers. Detailed flowfield measurements are made behind the rotor and stator, and the ensemble-averaged data is compared with a 3 -D, viscous analysis tool. The time-accurate flow measurements show a large blade to blade variation due to unsteady vortex shedding, which is not captured by conventional 3 -D, viscous analysis tools. An incompressible, vortex shedding model calibrated to the experimental data shows that the vortex shedding induces radial flows that redistribute flow properties in the spanwise direction. 'Correction' of the experimental data using the model gives a better comparison with the 3 -D, viscous analysis solution. In order to understand the possible benefits of aspiration, a meanline parameter study is performed over a range of rotor inlet Mach numbers, flow coefficients, and work coefficients. Viscous and shock losses are estimated for both conventional and aspirated stages. The results suggest that aspiration can have the largest impact on compressor performance at <b>high</b> <b>stage</b> <b>pressure</b> ratios. by Brian Joseph Schuler. Thesis (Ph. D.)

5000|$|Increasing {{pressure}} ratio, as Figure 1 above shows, {{increasing the}} pressure ratio increases {{the efficiency of}} the Brayton cycle. This is analogous to the increase of efficiency seen in the Otto cycle when the compression ratio is increased. However, practical limits occur when it comes to increasing the pressure ratio. First of all, increasing the pressure ratio increases the compressor discharge temperature. This can cause the temperature of the gasses leaving the combustor to exceed the metallurgical limits of the turbine. Also, the diameter of the compressor blades becomes progressively smaller in <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages</b> of the compressor. Because the gap between the blades and the engine casing increases in size {{as a percentage of the}} compressor blade height as the blades get smaller in diameter, a greater percentage of the compressed air can leak back past the blades in <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>stages.</b> This causes a drop in compressor efficiency, and is most likely to occur in smaller gas turbines (since blades are inherently smaller to begin with). Finally, as can be seen in Figure 1, the efficiency levels off as pressure ratio increases. Hence, little gain is expected by increasing the pressure ratio further if it is already at a high level.|$|R
