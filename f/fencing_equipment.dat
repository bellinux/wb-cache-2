50|$|A set of {{electric}} <b>fencing</b> <b>equipment</b> {{is required to}} participate in electric fencing. Electric equipment in fencing varies depending on the weapon with which it is used in accordance. The main component of a set {{of electric}} equipment is the body cord. The body cord serves as the connection between a fencer and a reel of wire that is part of a system for electrically detecting that the weapon has touched the opponent. There are two types: one for épée, and one for foil and sabre.|$|E
5000|$|The {{advent of}} the flick, among other factors, has caused the gap between {{classical}} and modern fencing to widen. In classical fencing, the touch scored with the flick is seen as cheating, because the fencer has changed {{the shape of his}} blade. Also, even most professionals cannot land their flick at every attempt. It takes much practice. If executed properly, a flick can displace the point by bending the blade to such a degree so that the tip of the blade is at angle of almost ninety degrees from the forte of the blade. This significant change allows for an otherwise impossible touch. For these reasons, the flick is the subject of much controversy. As of 2005, timing of <b>fencing</b> <b>equipment</b> has been changed to lengthen the time necessary that the weapon's point is pressed against the target for a valid touch to register. This was done to reduce the use of the flick and encourage the use of more traditional thrusts. This change is widely controversial, as it changes more of the game than just the ability to flick (such as giving fencers the ability to [...] "lock-out" [...] a riposte). Still, though, more skilled fencers have been able to continue using flicks in their tactics, although much less than before.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of livestock, mainly cattle, there are various pros and cons to castrating or leaving the animal intact. Leaving a bull calf (an intact male {{under the age of}} six months), allows the animal to gain more weight, and have a higher feed {{efficiency}} than compared to a steer (or castrated male calf). Leaving a bull calf intact however, can also have disadvantages. If left intact, bull calves can exhibit aggressive behaviour causing damages to <b>fences,</b> <b>equipment,</b> and handlers leaving an occupational risk for employees. Castrating a bull calf before the age of six months leads to a better performing animal not showing signs of aggression when penned with other males, while intact bulls will tend to fight with male siblings. Castration of bulls is recommended to occur before entering the feed lot as a precaution against infections and the calves are small enough to be handled easily with minimal stress towards the animal.|$|R
50|$|Fencing {{dates back}} to 1950 where the Windhoek Fencing Club was very active and took part even in South African Tournaments. But then for nearly 50 years Fencing was not practiced in Namibia. In 2006 Fencing was revived through the help of Usmanov and his Foundation. Due to his help by {{providing}} basic <b>fencing</b> <b>equipment</b> fencing in Namibia became alive again. 2007 the F.I.E. and the Namibian National Olympic Committee recognized the Namibian Fencing Federation. Because of Usmanovs support and contribution, Namibian fencers could even attend Training lessons and Workshops at Mr. Usmanovs African Training Center. It is located at Dr. Gennady Tyshlers Fencing School, Johannesburg, South Africa. This resulted in a growing interest for fencing and the Namibian Fencing Federation is by now a respected and well-recognized Federation. December 2008 the acting President of the Federation represented Namibia at the World Conference held at Paris,France. Because of the fast growing, beginning January 2009 a second fencing Club,called Highlanders, was opened in Windhoek. By June a Club was established at Katima Mulilo and Gobabis. The number of fencers increased to 40. During 2009 regular competitions were held to provide a national ranking system. November 2009 saw its first Namibian National Championship. The Year 2010 started with the first international Competition since 1956 at Cape Town. 4 Fencers took part a bronze medal was won in Junior Ladies Epee.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{estimated}} {{the effects of}} local pool-fencing ordinances and other factors on the rate of childhood drowning in Los Angeles County, California. METHODS: Stage 1 was a retrospective dynamic cohort study of all drownings among children younger than 10 years that occurred in residential swimming pools in Los Angeles County between 1990 and 1995. Stage 2 was a matched case-control study that compared pools in which childhood drownings occurred (cases) with randomly selected pools in which drownings did not occur (controls). RESULTS: The drowning rate was relatively high among toddlers (aged 1 - 4 years), boys, and African Americans and in areas with a high density of residential swimming pools. Pool-fencing ordinances were not associated with a reduced overall rate of childhood drowning. CONCLUSIONS: Local ordinances enacted in Los Angeles County before 1996 {{do not appear to}} have been effective in reducing the rate of childhood drowning in residential pools. Possible reasons for this ineffectiveness are insufficient building codes for isolating pools from homes, inadequate enforcement of the ordinances, and inadequate operation or maintenance of <b>fencing</b> <b>equipment</b> by pool owners...|$|E

40|$|Since 1958, when {{details of}} {{electrified}} permanent fencing tried by Massey College became known, {{hundreds of miles}} of electric subdivision fence have been erected. The key to its popularity was the great saving in costs of materials, transport and labour. It was also easier to erect, so it became possible for farm labour to construct electric fences instead of waiting for contract fencers. This reduced the amount of cash to be raised still further. Six manufacturers are selling electric <b>fence</b> <b>equipment,</b> and all have well-illustrated leaflets or booklets giving details of erection. In addition, many farmers, encouraged by Massey College, have kept costs very low by using standard bobbin insulators (Type 436) or short pieces of polythene water-pipe as insulators. The success of electric fencing depends on: (a) Careful insulation of electrified wires. (b) A continuous earth-wire running the length of the fence and connected to the earth terminal of the electric fence unit. (c) Removal of stray wires and excessive green vegetation from the fenceline. In practice thistles, grass, clover, secondary growth and tussocks gradually reach the live wires and reduce the efficiency of the fence, particularly in wet or misty weather. Sometimes insulators slip, break or become coated with dirt, so that again electric leakage becomes serious. Further, the 'wind-charger’ units available for inaccessible places sometimes fail to keep the battery fully charged. Consequently a number of electric fences have become ineffective. On the other hand a 'mains' operated unit has been used, and the fence has been checked regularly, electric subdivision fences have been very effective. In fact once the stock learn to respect an electric fence over a period of months, they do not worry it if it happens to be off for some days. Nevertheless, ineffective electric fences are so prevalent that many people hesitate to regard them as permanent, and suggest that they should be reinforced or replaced by standard fences when finance becomes available. This makes it clear that there are definite requirements to be met and limits to its use as permanent fencing...|$|R

Results from applying directional audio cues to free-ranging cows using hardware and software developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) will be discussed in light of how many animals in a herd potentially need to be instrumented in order to successfully gather the entire group. Conclusions • Free-ranging cows can be gathered autonomously using only audio cues administered from DVF™ devices. • Incorporating paddock information such as the location of trails, drinking water and corrals and replacing manual sequencing with algorithms that can administer sounds directionality through software will improve the efficiency of autonomous gathering. Objective • Is it possible to autonomously gather free-ranging cattle using preprogrammed audio cues to which the animals have been previously habituated...|$|R

40|$|Wood has a {{long history}} of use in {{familiar}} products, and even now wood is the staple material for buildings and furniture. Recently, new applications of wood have been decks, garden furniture, house <b>fences,</b> play <b>equipment,</b> boardwalks, and signboards. Wood products are also widely used in public construction works on river and roads such as bridges, sound-insulating fence, and guard-rail. The increase in the outdoor uses of wood products arises from their warmth and amenity properties, good design characteristics and natural harmony with the surrounding scenery. The environmental friendliness of wood is due to its renewability as a natural resource, to the low energy consumption in processing, and because it is easy to recycle or dispose. As proven by Horyuji Temple in Japan, which is the oldest wooden structure in the world, wood is almost an everlasting material. However, exterior wood, wood for outdoor uses is always exposed to weathering such as light or rainfall, and to biological deterioration by decay fungi or termites. For high-performance utilization of exterior wood products, not only structural reliability, but also durability and weathering resistance are highly required. We are conducting the research projects on the high-performance utilization of wood for outdoor uses, which are the characterization of the wood surfaces exposed to sunshine and rainfall, the non-destructive detection of decay and insect attacks in wood, the development of maintenance system to provide the long-life to wood, and so on.

40|$|One of the {{critical}} decisions facing livestock producers in Illinois is how to best utilize the forage resources on their farm. In a typical cow-calf operation, forages supply over 80 percent of the annual feed requirement. Over 90 percent of the diet of breeding ewes are forage. The manner in which this valuable resource is utilized often determines the profitability of a livestock operation. Unfortunately, on many farms pasture and haylands have received {{the least amount of}} management attention. In recent years producer awareness of pasture management has been increasing. A number of factors have brought this about. Mainly, economic conditions have forth producers to look at their bottom line and this has reflected the low returns from mismanagement of forages and pastures. Also, worldwide lowering of feed grain prices and new emphasis on soil erosion and water quality have led many farmers to a renewed interest in forage and grassland agriculture. Lastly, advancements in the technology of pasture management and improvement have made more intensive utilization of the forage resource more economically viable. Advances in <b>equipment,</b> especially <b>fencing</b> and water <b>equipment</b> have also helped bring about the increased interest in better grassland management.

Depredation was defined as damage to privately-owned crops, forage, and <b>fences</b> and irrigation <b>equipment</b> by these animals. The focus on the three ungulate species was prompted by concerns that elk, which had recolonized the INEEL since 1984, were responsible for {{an inordinate amount of}} unprecedented damage to agricultural operations.

We conducted surveys requesting information on wildlife species and type of damage covered by compensation programs, annual cost of programs, and the monitoring and assessment of program success to the wildlife agencies of all states and Canadian provinces. We also requested information on programs providing producers with damage-abatement materials instead of or in addition to financial compensation. All states and provinces responded to our survey. Nineteen states and 7 provinces had compensation programs, and 34 states and 7 provinces provided damage-abatement materials. Most programs were funded by the state, but private and federal organizations also funded some programs. Deer (Odocoileus spp.) were the most common species in compensation programs (in 14 states and provinces) followed by bear (Ursus spp.; in 12), elk (Cervus elaphus; in l 0), moose (Alces alces; in 7), waterfowl (in 6), pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana; in 6), wolves (Canis spp.; in 5), mountain lions (Puma concolor; in 4), and coyotes (Canis latrans; in 3).
