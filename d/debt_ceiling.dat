5|$|In 1944, BOT {{superintendent}} Philip E. Pheifer {{put forth}} a proposal for Second Avenue Subway services, which would branch extensively off to B Division. The subway was originally to be opened by 1951, but by 1945, plans for the Second Avenue Subway were again revised. Another plan was put forth in 1947 by Colonel Sidney H. Bingham, a city planner and former Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) engineer. O'Dwyer and Gross believed that construction of a Second Avenue subway line would be vital to both increasing capacity on existing lines and allowing new branch lines to be built. Bingham's proposal involved more branch lines and track connections than did Phiefer's, and similar to the 1960s and 1990s phased proposals, was {{to be built in}} sections. However, by the next year, New York City was short $145 million that was needed for a $800 million program for rehabilitation and proposed capital improvements.

5|$|Spending {{and loan}} {{guarantees}} from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department {{authorized by the}} Bush and Obama administrations totaled about $11.5trillion, but only $3trillion was spent {{by the end of}} November 2009. Obama and the Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010 budget deficit would be $1.5trillion or 10.6% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4trillion or 9.9% of GDP. For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit will shrink to $1.34trillion, and the 10-year deficit will increase to $8.53trillion or 90% of GDP. The most recent increase in the U.S. <b>debt</b> <b>ceiling</b> to $17.2trillion took effect in February 2014. On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings. By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to analyse}} the {{constitutional}} and legal limits {{which have been}} established with regards to budgetary stability and financial sustainability and their possible application to the Spanish autonomous communities.

40|$|As {{a direct}} e¤ect of the …nancial crisis in 2008, public debt began to {{accumulate}} rapidly, eventually {{leading to the}} European sovereign debt crisis. However, the dramatic increase in government debt is not only happening in European countries. All major G 7 countries are experiencing similar developments. What {{are the implications of}} this kind of massive de…cit and debt policy for the long term stability of these economies? Are there limits in debt-ratios that qualitatively change policy options? While theory can easily illustrate these limits, where are these limits in real economies? This paper examines the relationship between sovereign debt dynamics and capital formation, and accounts for the e¤ects of the 2008 …nancial crisis on debt sustainability for the four largest advanced economies. We contribute to the literature on …scal sustainability by framing the problem in an OLG model with government debt, physical capital, endogenous interest rates, and exogenous growth. For the calibration exercise we extract data from the OECD for Germany as a stabilization anchor in Europe, the U. S., the U. K., and Japan for almost two decades before the 2008 crisis. Except for intertemporal preferences all parameters are drawn or directly derived from the OECD database, or endogenously determined within the model. The results of the calibration exercise are alarming for all four countries under consideration. We identify <b>debt</b> <b>ceilings</b> that indicate a sustainable and unsustainable regime. For 2011, all four economies are either close to-, or have already passed the ceiling. The results call for a dramatic re-adjustment in budget policies for a consolidation period and long-term …scal rules that make it possible to sustain su ¢ cient capital intensity so that these economies can maintain their high income levels.
