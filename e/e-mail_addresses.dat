5|$|The duo enlisted a music {{marketing}} startup company—TopspinMedia—to {{design their}} site, delivery {{options for the}} digitalmusic, and promotional webwidgets. Like {{the entirety of the}} recording process, the marketing was self-financed and controlled by the artists, with Topspin taking a portion of the money made from digital sales. This allowed the artists to control creative aspects of producing music as well as the overhead costs associated with marketing an album. The company used viralmarketing techniques to collect potential customers' e-mailaddresses and encourage them to post the album streaming on their blogs. By early November, the collected <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> amounted to 37percent of the album sales. Topspin has also created a Flickr pool encouraging users to upload screenshots of the widget posted to web sites. No advertisements were taken out for the album.|$|E
25|$|On 11 June, reports {{emerged that}} LulzSec hacked into and stole user {{information}} from the pornography website www.pron.com. They obtained and published around 26,000 <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> and passwords. Among the information stolen were records of two users who subscribed using email addresses associated with the Malaysian government, three users who subscribed using United States military email addresses and 55 users who LulzSec claimed were administrators of other adult-oriented websites. Following the breach, Facebook locked the accounts of all users who had used the published <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses,</b> and also blocked new Facebook accounts opened using the leaked <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses,</b> fearing that users of the site would get hacked after LulzSec encouraged people to try and see if these people used identical user name and password combinations on Facebook as well.|$|E

50|$|Typically Robot CAs {{are set up}} to {{validate}} that the public key belonging to an <b>e-mail</b> <b>address</b> does actually belong to the <b>e-mail</b> <b>address.</b> This is achieved by the Robot CA signing each uid on the public key and sending the signed copy to the <b>e-mail</b> <b>address,</b> encrypted with the public key. If the public key belongs to whoever reads the <b>e-mail</b> <b>address,</b> they receive the signed copy, can decrypt it and then publish {{it to the public}} key servers.

25|$|An often-used {{analogy to}} explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as the phone book for the Internet by {{translating}} human-friendly computer hostnames into IP addresses. For example, the domain name www.example.com translates to the addresses 93.184.216.119 (IPv4) and 2606:2800:220:6d:26bf:1447:1097:aa7 (IPv6). Unlike a phone book, DNS can be quickly updated, allowing a service's location on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue {{to use the same}} host name. Users take advantage of this when they use meaningful Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> without having to know how the computer actually locates the services.|$|E
25|$|Sanford Wallace and Cyber Promotions {{were the}} target of a string of lawsuits, many of which were settled out of court, up through a 1998 Earthlink {{settlement}} that put Cyber Promotions out of business. Attorney Laurence Canter was disbarred by the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1997 for sending prodigious amounts of spam advertising his immigration law practice. In 2005, Jason Smathers, a former America Online employee, pleaded guilty to charges of violating the CAN-SPAM Act.

25|$|The 2008 US presidential {{campaign}} {{had a huge}} presence on social networking sites. Barack Obama, a virtually unknown Democratic candidate, utilized 15 different social media websites to form relationships with the millions of American citizens who utilize those networks. His social networking profile pages were constantly being updated and interacting with followers. By {{the end of his}} campaign, Obama had 5 million social media network supporters (2.5 million on Facebook and 115,000 on Twitter). The use of social networking sites in his marketing campaign gave Barack Obama's campaign access to <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses,</b> as posted on social network profile pages.

The intelligence information the diplomats were ordered to gather included biometric information (which apparently included DNA, fingerprints, and iris scans), passwords, and personal encryption keys used in private and commercial networks for official communications. It also included Internet and intranet usernames, <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses,</b> web site URLs useful for identification, credit card numbers, frequent flyer account numbers, and work schedules. The targeted human intelligence was requested in {{a process known as}} the National Humint Collection Directive, and was aimed at foreign diplomats of US allies as well.|$|E
25|$|In survey sampling, {{many of the}} {{individuals}} identified {{as part of the}} sample may be unwilling to participate, not have the time to participate (opportunity cost), or survey administrators may {{not have been able to}} contact them. In this case, there is a risk of differences, between respondents and nonrespondents, leading to biased estimates of population parameters. This is often addressed by improving survey design, offering incentives, and conducting follow-up studies which make a repeated attempt to contact the unresponsive and to characterize their similarities and differences with the rest of the frame. The effects can also be mitigated by weighting the data when population benchmarks are available or by imputing data based on answers to other questions. Nonresponse is particularly a problem in internet sampling. Reasons for this problem include improperly designed surveys, over-surveying (or survey fatigue), and the fact that potential participants hold multiple <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses,</b> which they don't use anymore or don't check regularly.|$|E
25|$|Privacy {{concerns}} with social networking services {{have been raised}} growing concerns among users {{on the dangers of}} giving out too much personal information and the threat of sexual predators. Users of these services also {{need to be aware of}} data theft or viruses. However, large services, such as Myspace and Netlog, often work with law enforcement to try to prevent such incidents. In addition, there is a perceived privacy threat in relation to placing too much personal information in the hands of large corporations or governmental bodies, allowing a profile to be produced on an individual's behavior on which decisions, detrimental to an individual, may be taken. Furthermore, there is an issue over the control of data and information that was altered or removed by the user may in fact be retained and passed to third parties. This danger was highlighted when the controversial social networking site Quechup harvested <b>e-mail</b> <b>addresses</b> from users' e-mail accounts for use in a spamming operation.|$|E
40|$|Online reprint request (ORR) is the {{standard}} protocol to obtain the reprints (e-print/hard copy) using the internet (author&#x 2032;s <b>e-mail</b> <b>address)</b> when the required literature is not available. The problem of higher cost of surface mail for the author and the reader, {{as well as the}} time taken to receive postal reprints, is overcome by ORR. This technique has its limitation in message failure, expiration of mail (e-mail decay), or journal not providing author&#x 2032;s <b>e-mail</b> <b>address.</b> This article analyzes the available practical solution to overcome these barriers. This process facilitates the exchange of scientific information. In e-mail decay, reprint request can be sent in the following order: a) search and send to author&#x 2032;s latest <b>e-mail</b> <b>address,</b> b) co-author&#x 2032;s latest or affiliated institution&#x 2032;s <b>e-mail</b> <b>address,</b> c) postal reprint request providing the requestor&#x 2032;s <b>e-mail</b> <b>address.</b> This protocol can be practiced when library facilities or required literature is not available.
