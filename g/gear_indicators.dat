40|$|There the carrierless ZK {{planetary}} gears with coaxial arrangement of central wheeles and with approximate internal engagement of planet pinion {{have been studied}} in view to improvement of mass and dimensions of drive, to decrease of its cost, to rise of workability. The hew schemes of carrierless {{planetary gears}} have been developed, the geometrical theory of internal plane approximate engagement has been created, the dependences to analyse the wheel teeth for rigidity, strength have been obtained; the dependences of non-uniformity of distribution of load and stresses on the <b>gear</b> <b>indicators</b> have been studied.

40|$|The {{manner of}} gear {{shifting}} {{is one of}} the main factors affecting the fuel efficiency of motor vehicles. Potential savings resulted from optimized gear shifting led to introduction of <b>gear</b> shift <b>indicators</b> in passenger vehicles as an obligation from year 2012. The effects of <b>gear</b> shift <b>indicators</b> usage are still not studied enough. That was the motive for the authors to conduct the experiments to justify their usage, both from the economic and ecological standpoint. The presented results come from the tests conducted on FIAT 500 L vehicle to determine the fuel consumption using the new European driving cycle, but for three different gear shift patterns: (1) as defined in UNECE Regulation No. 83, (2) as indicated by vehicle’s <b>gear</b> shift <b>indicator,</b> and (3) based on the average vehicle speed values collected from <b>gear</b> shift <b>indicators</b> of 35 passenger vehicles of different makes, types, and characteristics. Maximum difference in fuel consumption recorded in tests done using three different gear shift patterns is 18. 7 %...|$|R
5000|$|The Shiver is also {{available}} as a partially faired option known as the Shiver 750 GT, which was launched in 2009. [...] The instrument panel features comprehensive gauges including a <b>gear</b> <b>indicator.</b> The 'Ride by Wire' electronic throttle has three available power settings, referred to as Sport, Touring and Rain.

5000|$|On 28 July 1959, an East Anglian Flying Services Vickers 614 Viking 1 (registration: G-AHPH) {{was written}} {{off in a}} landing accident. On {{approach}} the aircraft's right-hand main <b>gear</b> <b>indicator</b> showed that the gear was unsafe. An emergency landing was made on the grass parallel to the runway. The right gear collapsed and the aircraft swung to the right, damaging it beyond repair. None of the 39 occupants were injured.|$|R
5000|$|On December 28, 1978, United Airlines Flight 173, a Douglas DC-8-61 {{en route}} from Denver, Colorado, to Portland, Oregon, {{experienced}} a landing <b>gear</b> <b>indicator</b> light malfunction while preparing to land.

25|$|On June 5, 2007, a Canadian North De Havilland Canada Dash 8, {{en route}} from Gjoa Haven to Cambridge Bay made an {{emergency}} landing at Yellowknife Airport after the landing <b>gear</b> <b>indicator</b> showed the nose gear as failing to lock on extension while on approach to Cambridge Bay Airport. The pilot {{made the decision to}} re-route to Yellowknife, as the airport was better equipped for emergency landings. The aircraft landed safely in Yellowknife on its main gear and there were no injuries.|$|R
25|$|Ergonomic and {{cosmetic}} {{changes for the}} 2008 model include a higher windscreen, and interlocking gauge faces with a digital speedometer, {{as well as a}} new <b>gear</b> <b>indicator</b> and adjustable shift light. The fairing fasteners were hidden to uncomplicate custom paint work. The twin-spar aluminum frame was carried over from the previous version, and wheelbase, rake/trail, and seat height were the same, while overall length grew by two inches, and the taller windscreen added about ½inch. Weight was saved by omitting the centerstand.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flight was}} routine until 23:32, {{when the plane}} began its {{approach}} into Miami International Airport. After lowering the gear, Stockstill noticed that the landing <b>gear</b> <b>indicator,</b> a green light identifying that the nose gear is properly locked in the [...] "down" [...] position, had not illuminated. This was later discovered {{to be due to}} a burned-out light bulb. The landing gear could have been manually lowered nonetheless. The pilots cycled the landing gear, but still failed to get the confirmation light.|$|R

The car had an 18-gallon fuel tank, Anti-lock brakes, and a power radio antenna located in the rear passenger side quarter panel. Instrumentation included gas gauge, speedometer, and <b>gear</b> <b>indicator.</b> Optional instrumentation included a tachometer and temperature, oil pressure, and charging voltage gauges.|$|R
5000|$|The {{investigation}} commission {{produced the}} following conclusion: [...] "...the probable {{cause of this}} accident {{was the lack of}} crew coordination and the inadequate monitoring of the aircraft position in space during a critical phase of an instrument landing approach which resulted in an unplanned descent into the water. Contributing to this unplanned descent was an apparent unsafe landing gear condition induced by the design of the landing <b>gear</b> <b>indicator</b> lights, and the omission of the minimum crossing altitude at an approach fix depicted on the approach chart." ...|$|R

50|$|Eastern Air Lines Flight 401 was a Lockheed L-1011-1 Tristar jet {{that crashed}} into the Florida Everglades at 11:42 pm December 29, 1972, causing 101 fatalities.

The crash occurred while the entire flight crew was preoccupied with a burnt-out landing <b>gear</b> <b>indicator</b> light. They failed to notice that the autopilot had inadvertently been disconnected and, as a result, the aircraft gradually lost altitude and crashed. It was the first crash of a widebody aircraft and at the time, the second-deadliest single-aircraft disaster in the United States.|$|R

5000|$|On 28 July 1959, an East Anglian Flying Services Vickers 614 Viking 1 (registration G-AHPH) {{was written}} off at Southend Airport {{as a result}} of being damaged beyond repair in a landing {{accident}} {{at the end of a}} non-scheduled passenger flight. On approach to Southend, the aircraft's right-hand main <b>gear</b> <b>indicator</b> did not show [...] "green", thereby failing to confirm that the gear was down and locked. The pilot in command of the aircraft attempted an emergency landing on the grass parallel to the runway after noticing that the emergency gear extension system was inoperable. Following touch-down, the right main gear collapsed and the aircraft swung to the right, damaging it beyond repair. None of the 39 occupants (three crew and 36 passengers) were injured.|$|R
