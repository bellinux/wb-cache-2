50|$|Optics in Europe was {{represented}} by the <b>European</b> <b>Optical</b> Committee (EOC) until 1984, when the EOC joined the European Physical Society (EPS) to create an Optics Division. Two years later the national <b>optical</b> <b>societies</b> of several <b>European</b> countries founded the European Federation for Applied Optics - Europtica - which was officially registered in Paris in 1987. In December 1986 a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between EPS (the legal representative of the Optics Division), Europtica, and SPIE, in which the three parties agreed to organise jointly one major annual optics meeting in Europe. This MOU initiated the ECO series of meetings, which were managed by the French organisation Europtica Services International Communications. The experience with these conferences demonstrated the need for effective organisation of optical activities in Europe.|$|R

50|$|The first {{idea for}} an International Year of Light {{dates back to}} 2009 when John Dudley, IYL 2015 Steering Committee Chair, {{proposed}} the idea whilst representing the Quantum Electronics and Optics Division (QEOD) of the European Physical Society (EPS) {{at a meeting of}} the International Council of Quantum Electronics (ICQE) in Baltimore, USA. An item that was discussed at this meeting was how to follow up activities that were planned to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the laser (LaserFest) in 2010 with something even more ambitious. The photonics community felt that there was a real opportunity to reach out beyond the scientific sector to raise much broader awareness of the problem-solving potential of light-based science in so many areas of life, and to make a global effort to influence education and policy in both developed and developing countries. The proposal was endorsed by ICQE and thus began the adventure towards IYL 2015.International Years are part of the United Nations (UN) declared observances that promote awareness of issues relevant to its aims and international programmes.  The first step to successfully achieve the proclamation of the International Year was to work through UNESCO to prepare and submit a resolution to the UN General Assembly.  But before this, EPS had to construct the proposal in detail and build a consortium amongst the major optics and physics societies. During 2010 and 2011, the main motivations and goals for IYL 2015 were drafted, and it was decided that 2015 would be the target year based on several key scientific anniversaries. With the support of the EPS President Luisa Cifarelli, an important milestone occurred in September 2011 when the Italian Physical Society and EPS organized in Varenna, Italy, the Passion for Light launch meeting for IYL 2015, where representatives of UNESCO and the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (UNESCO-ICTP) were present, both to learn more about our plans and to show their support. This was the essential step that brought the guidance and experience of UNESCO’s International Basic Science Programme to the proposal.With the help of the Institute of Physics (especially Sir Peter Knight who was the president at the time), EPS led a delegation to the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) General Assembly in London, United Kingdom, during November 2011 to obtain endorsement, providing an important green light recognizing the international nature of the proposal. At this point there were many partners involved: in addition to EPS and its own European member societies, the IYL 2015 team included the African Physical Society, the American Physical Society, the Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies, the Chinese Optical and Physical Societies, the <b>European</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Society,</b> the International Commission for Optics (ICO), the IEEE Photonics Society, the Optical Society (OSA), the international society for optics and photonics (SPIE), as well as many other partners and societies from Africa, Australia, Canada, the Middle East, New Zealand, South America, and elsewhere.From March 2012 things moved quickly. With help from the Director of UNESCO’s International Basic Science Programme Dr. Maciej Nalecz, a consortium of supporting UNESCO member states was assembled. Much support was needed from a number of international scientific partners at this stage, and it is essential here to acknowledge Francis Allotey (Ghana) and Ana María Cetto (Mexico) for their leading roles. Other assistance  was provided by Zsolt Fulop (Hungary), John Harvey and Geoff Austin (New Zealand), Zohra Ben Lakhdar and Mourad Zghal (Tunisia), Joe Niemela (UNESCO-ICTP), Lluis Torner (Spain) and Sergei Bagaev and Victor Zadkov (Russia). A resolution supporting IYL 2015 was prepared and was adopted by the UNESCO Executive Board at its 190th session which took place at the UNESCO HQ in Paris, France, 3-18  October 2012. The resolution was placed before the Executive Board by Ghana, Mexico, the Russian Federation (Board Members), and New Zealand (UNESCO Member State).  UNESCO delegates from Ghana and Mexico introduced the proposal to the Executive Board.  The resolution was adopted by the Executive Board joined by co-signatories from a further 27 Board Members: Angola, Bangladesh, Brazil, Burkina Faso, China, Congo, Cuba, Djibouti, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Kenya, Indonesia, Italy, Malawi, Nigeria, Peru, the Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Thailand, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, the United States of America, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. Other Member States of UNESCO who declared support for the initiative were Hungary, Serbia, and South Africa. UNESCO's official support opened the gate to approach the UN General Assembly to officially endorse the International Year.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analytical}} {{model of a}} single natural guide star astronomical adaptive optics system, in closed loop mode. The model is used to simulate the long exposure system point spread function, using the spatial frequency (or Fourier) approach, and complement an initial open loop model. Applications range from system design, science case analysis and AO data reduction. All the classical phase errors have been included: deformable mirror fitting error, wavefront sensor spatial aliasing, wavefront sensor noise, and the correlated anisoplanatic and servo-lag error. The model includes the deformable mirror spatial transfer function, and the actuator array geometry can {{be different from the}} wavefront sensor lenslet array geometry. We also include the dispersion between the sensing and the correction wavelengths. Illustrative examples are given {{at the end of the}} paper.

40|$|The 11 th Topical Meeting of the <b>European</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Society,</b> on Materials for Nonlinear Optics, {{was held}} in Capri, Italy, 8 - 12 July 1997. The meeting was devoted to {{producing}} a general overview of different problems connected with the preparation, characterization and use of materials for nonlinear optical applications. It consisted of invited and contributed papers outlining the latest developments and two poster sessions. The main aim of the symposium organized in Capri was to give a forum on the advancement of the {{research in the field}} of optical nonlinear materials in Europe. Participation from both company and university research centres was sought after, and achieved, in order to boost the transfer of ideas and initiate research contacts. The importance of the field under debate was indicated by the level of attendance: about 120 participants, mostly from Europe but with representatives from the Americas, Japan and Australia, took part in the symposium.

40|$|Laser Speckle Contrast Analysis (LASCA) {{has been}} {{proven to be a}} highly useful tool for the full-field {{determination}} of the blood perfusion of a variety of tissues. Some of the major advantages of this technique are its relatively high spatial and temporal resolution as well as its good or excellent accordance to Doppler systems. However, traditionally it is only able to report a single characteristic speed regarding to the actual range of interest. This might be misleading if multiple characteristic speeds are present (e. g. tremor and perfusion in skin) or if several kinds of tissues are mixed (e. g. parenchyma and vessels in brain). Here we present two relatively simple extensions of LASCA for these problems. The application of multiple autocorrelation functions (combined with the usage of multiple exposure times) can help in the separation of multiple characteristic speeds. We also present a useful method for the separation of information those originate from a mixture of different tissues. The latter method can be also implemented to single-exposure systems. © 2015, <b>European</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Society</b> (EOS). All rights reserved...|$|E
