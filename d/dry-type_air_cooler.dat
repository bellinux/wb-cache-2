In this paper, we simulate the solidification of 60 t Q 235 huge rectangular ingot with ProCAST in different cooling conditions such as <b>air</b> <b>cooling,</b> forced <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> and water cooling. The results show that solidification time in forced <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> and water cooling shortened than that in <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> respectively by 0. 9 hours and 2. 2 hours; The primary fine-grain area is large in the forced <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> and water <b>cooling.</b> In forced <b>air</b> <b>cooling,</b> we can obtain the largest equiaxial crystal ratio and the minimum columnar crystal ratio; The shrinkage cavity position of the ingot in forced <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> and water cooling is closer to riser {{than it is in}} <b>air</b> <b>cooling,</b> but the volumes of shrinkage cavities respectively increased {{to a greater extent than}} in <b>air</b> <b>cooling...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In high {{temperature}} coal mine, the surface <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> heat exchange efficiency decreases greatly {{because of high}} humidity and dust. In order to improve the heat exchange efficiency, {{the surface of the}} <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> needs to be designed to reduce the dust adhesion, and improve the heat exchange efficiency. Based on the self-cleaning effect of lotus leaf, the surface of <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> is designed and fin and tube are processed into the constructure of lotus leaf surface. With Ansys, the <b>cooling</b> effect of <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> is simulated, and the experiment is done to test the heat exchange effect of the common <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> and bionic <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> in lab. By analysis, it can be concluded that the surface of bionic <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> has the function of self-cleaning, and the structure can increase the heat exchange efficiency, which is higher above 30 % than that of common <b>air</b> <b>cooler...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} a cold {{production}} process was proposed for inlet <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> in which cryogenic energy from {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) was sufficiently converted to cold energy. The effect of using the cold production process for inlet <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> on the off-design performance of a gas turbine combined cycle was analyzed under different ambient conditions. The cold output of the proposed process was increased by about 38. 1 % to 42. 5 % {{compared to that of}} the conventional cold production process that involves direct LNG evaporation. Furthermore for the inlet <b>air</b> <b>cooling,</b> the proposed method increased the relative power increment from 2. 2 % to 14. 4 % and the relative efficiency increment from 0. 7 % to 2. 2 %, mainly depending on the variations in the relative humidity, compared to cold production without <b>air</b> <b>cooling.</b> The relative power and relative efficiency of the proposed <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> were increased by 0. 6 % to 3. 1 % and 0. 3 % to 0. 5 %, respectively, above those of the traditional <b>air</b> <b>cooling...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the spatial variation of temperature, relative humidity and black globe humidity temperature (BGHT) index in growing-finishing swine facilities, with and without evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler.</b> The experiment was conducted in a 60 x 9 m facility containing 32 pens of 3. 20 x 4. 00 m each, divided into two sectors. The treatments were without evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> (control) and with evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler.</b> Temperature and relative humidity data were collected weekly in two periods (morning and afternoon) at 32 different sampling points, encompassing the center of each pen and the outer perimeter of the facility. Animal performance variables were: feed intake, feed conversion, weight out of the nursery, slaughter weight, weight gain and daily weight gain. According to the results, the analyzed variables showed spatial dependence, with lower temperature and higher relative humidity in the evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> environment. However, evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> system provided better environment thermal conditions inside the facilities, lowering BGHT values, which were lower in the adiabatic cooling sector.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} chiller energy {{consumption}} {{in a central}} air-conditioning system, a heat exchanger, acting as an <b>air</b> <b>cooler,</b> can be installed before an air handling unit to pre-cool the fresh <b>air</b> by recovering <b>cooling</b> capacity from exhaust air. However, studies on evaluating the performances of <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> under condensation condition are limited. Therefore, an experimental {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the plate type <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> performance under four operating modes (dry/wet mode, low/high air humidity). Under dry operating mode, the <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> serves as a traditional air cooler; while under wet operating mode, it works as an indirect evaporative cooler (IEC). The cooler dynamic performances during different operating mode transition were investigated. The steady performances under different parameter influence were also comparatively studied. The results show that wet operating improves the sensible and latent <b>cooling</b> capacities of <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> significantly. Condensation takes place under high humidity inlet air, results in decreasing of sensible efficiency but increasing of latent efficiency and total heat transfer rate. The coefficient of performance (COP) of IEC is higher than that of traditional <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> under the same testing configuration. The highest COP can reach 9. 0 and achieved under wet operating mode with condensation. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|Most {{aviation}} {{piston engines}} are air-cooled. <b>Air</b> <b>cooled</b> engines are lighter than their major alternative - water cooled engines, because the lower weight of <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> engines in aircraft design being {{a more important}} factor than the lower drag of water cooled engines. While water cooled engines were widely used {{from the early days}} of flight, <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> engines were the dominant choice in aircraft. Following the Second World War, turbojets and jet turbine powered aircraft have come to dominate flight regimes where water cooled piston engines offered a drag advantage. Thus today, piston engines are mostly used in slower general aviation aircraft where low weight is an advantage. Therefore, most aero engines produced today are of the <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> variety. Today, most of the engines currently (2005) manufactured by Lycoming and Continental and used by major manufacturers of light aircraft Cirrus, Cessna and so on.|$|R
