40|$|L'article parteix de la lectura dels dos primers capítols de l'obra de Sigmund Freud El malestar en la cultura, publicada el 1930, i n'examina la vigència. El que Freud <b>hi</b> ensenya <b>és</b> que, partint de la contingència de l'existència, tant de l'un com de l'altre (jo i el proïsme), no es troba fonament necessari per a cap ètica regulada exclusivament pel prin-cipi de plaer. La realitat no és adequada a l'ésser humà, i això perquè ella mateixa prové de les obres de defensa fetes per les generacions anteriors contra la pulsió. Aquesta és definida per Freud com el desacord fonamental de l'ésser que parla, que tendeix a expulsar-lo constantment fora de si mateix i de tota obra civilitzada. L'imperatiu ètic és aleshores el de, amb aquest {{impossible}} interior, fer-nos un estil de vida. La civilització, és a dir, el que podem tenir en comú amb els altres que porten a terme la mateixa lluita, prové de la necessitat de domesticar la pulsió amb el treball, la creació, l'establiment de lligams socials, sense que cap valor suprem, ni cap nom absolut no ens alliberi de l'opressió ni de la destrucció. The {{starting point}} {{of this article is}} a reading of the first two chapters of Sigmund Freud's Civilisation and Its Discontents, published in 1930, and an assessment of their validity. What Freud indicates in these chapters is that, starting from the contingency of existence, both of the one and of the other (I and my fellow), neither finds any fundamental necessity for an ethics regulated exclusively by the principle of pleasure. Reality is not suitable to the human being, because it derives directly from the defence work carried out by earlier generations against the drive. This is defined by Freud as the fundamental disagreement of the speaking being, who tends to expel it constantly outwith itself and outwith all civilised works. Thus, the imperative ethic is, with this impossible interior, that of creating a style of life for ourselves. Civilisation, that is, the things we may have in common with others who are carrying out the same struggle, comes from the need to domesticate this drive with work, creation, the establishment of social connections, without any supreme value or absolute Name guaranteeing us from oppression or destruction...|$|R
40|$|Cold water {{immersion}} {{is commonly used}} to alleviate the stress and damage that ensues following strenuous exercise. Alongside its purported performance and analgesic benefits recent literature highlights the positive impact it may have towards endurance adaptive responses, particularly on key markers of mitochondrial biogenesis. Despite these recent advances showing PGC- 1 α, the ‘master regulator’ of mitochondrial biogenesis, being augmented in its post-exercise response by cold {{water immersion}}, the precise controlling mechanisms remain to be determined. However, {{it has been suggested}} that local cooling effects on AMPK and p 38 MAPK related signalling and/or increased systemic β-adrenergic stimulation are involved. Study 1 (Chapter 4) examined whether post-exercise cold-water immersion induced augmentation of PGC- 1 α mRNA is mediated through local or systemic mechanisms. Participants completed acute cycling followed by seated-rest (CON) or single-leg cold-water immersion (CWI; 10 min, 8 °C) with muscle biopsies obtained pre-, post- and 3 h post-exercise from a single limb in the CON condition but from both limbs in CWI (thereby providing tissue from a CWI and non-immersed limb, NOT). Muscle temperature decreased following CWI (- 5 °C), with lesser changes observed in CON and NOT (- 3 °C; P< 0. 05). A significant interaction effect was present for AMPK phosphorylation (P= 0. 031). Exercise (CON) increased gene expression of PGC- 1 α 3 h post-exercise (~ 5 -fold; P< 0. 001). Post-exercise CWI augmented PGC- 1 α expression above CON in immersed (CWI; ~ 9 -fold; P= 0. 003) and NOT limbs (~ 12 -fold; P= 0. 001). Plasma Normetanephrine concentration was higher in CWI vs. CON post-immersion (860 vs. 665 pmol·L- 1; P= 0. 034). Data herein reports for the first time that local cooling of the immersed limb evokes transcriptional control of PGC 1 -α in the non-immersed limb, suggesting increased systemic β-adrenergic activation of AMPK may mediate, in part, post-exercise cold-induction of PGC- 1 α mRNA. Study 2 (Chapter 5) assessed the impact of combining a post-exercise cooling stimulus with prior low glycogen as both stressors are shown to separately enhance the post-exercise PGC- 1 α response. A single-leg depletion protocol and bi-lateral muscle biopsies with and without post-exercise CWI were utilised to give the following conditions: High glycogen control (HI CON), Low glycogen control (LO CON), High glycogen CWI (HI CWI) and Low glycogen CWI (LO CWI). HI limbs began the experimental day ~ 190 mmol·kg- 1 dry weight (dw) with low limbs at ~ 85 mmol·kg- 1 dw glycogen before undergoing the same relative exercise protocol as Chapter 4. PGC- 1 α mRNA was different between conditions (P = 0. 039) with HI glycogen limbs showing greater expression than contralateral LO glycogen limbs (P < 0. 05). PGC- 1 α mRNA increased to a greater extent in CWI HI vs. CON <b>HI</b> (<b>ES</b> 0. 67 Large). Data herein supports previous research that shows post-exercise CWI is able to augment PGC- 1 α above the exercise response alone, however this response was not evident in heavily depleted limbs (~ 85 mmol·kg- 1 dw), suggesting a critical threshold may exist for the expected enhancement of PGC- 1 α to occur when exercise is commenced in a low glycogen state. Chapter 6 sought to examine the contribution of CWI (Chapter 4, Experiment 1) and/or low muscle glycogen (Chapter 5, Experiment 2) in the activation of PGC- 1 α via either the canonical (Exon 1 a) or the alternative promoter (Exon 1 b) regions. Data was obtained using muscle biopsy samples collected from the previous chapters (Chapter 4 and 5). Exercise increased the expression of promoter specific PGC- 1 α, with greater fold changes seen in Exon 1 b. Experiment 1 (Chapter 4) showed PGC- 1 α Exon 1 b expression closely matched the pattern of expression seen for total-PGC- 1 α, with large, systemic cold-induced increases in the non-immersed (NOT, 2344 fold change from Pre, P = 0. 010) and immersed (CWI, 1860 fold change from Pre, P = 0. 07), compared with the control limb (CON, 579 fold change from Pre). Results from experiment 2 (Chapter 5) saw PGC- 1 α Exon 1 a and 1 b gene expression increase post-exercise, with the Exon 1 b response showing lower fold-changes at 3 h post-exercise compared to those from Experiment 1 (chapter 4), despite the same exercise protocol being utilised (~ 200 fold increases in experiment 2 vs. ~ 2000 fold increases in experiment 1). The data suggests that depletion exercise in the days prior to the experimental day may have raised basal RNA levels, which may have therefore contributed to dampened fold-changes seen post-exercise when relativized to pre-exercise values. The lack of a cold augmentation in promoter specific PGC- 1 α gene expression in experiment 2 suggests this response may be extremely acute, and may not occur when cooling is undertaken on the third day of exercise. This thesis provides a novel insight into the influence of local, systemic and upstream activating mechanisms regulating the post-exercise, post-cooling and exercising in low glycogen states upon PGC- 1 α. These findings provide mechanistic application for future study designs and practical application in the support for the use of CWI when the intended target is an upregulation of the gene PGC- 1 α...|$|R

El primer element que pateix la diversitat de {{perspectives}} i d'opinions és el nom d'allò que hom parla a la Franja, és a dir, del català que <b>hi</b> perviu i <b>es</b> manifesta en diferents varietats dialectals. En aquest article presentem un repàs de les distintes denominacions aplicades al català a la comunitat autònoma d'Aragó, recordant, en primer lloc, les que utilitzen els mateixos parlants; repassant, en segon lloc, les que apareixen en els diversos textos legislatius en els quals s'aborda l'estatut jurídic de les llengües pròpies d'Aragó; i analitzant, finalment, la conveniència del sintagma aragonès oriental, aparegut amb certa força arran de l'aprovació de la Llei de llengües de 2013. The arbitrariness of {{the administrative}} demarcation of the territory called La Franja ignores the language issue. This has helped to create a distorted image throughout Aragonese society of the language which is spoken in that area.

40|$|Endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) is the {{treatment}} of choice for common bile duct stones in elderly patients. For those in whom endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct fails {{the treatment}} options include stenting, dissolution therapy and lithotripsy. Surgery is often avoided because of the reported high morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. We have reviewed the outcome of patients referred for surgery after failed endoscopic clearance of common bile duct stones. Over a 3 -year period, 100 patients with common bile duct stones were referred specifically for endoscopic clearance of the common bile duct (median age 69 years, range 19 - 97 years). In seven patients duct clearance was possible without ES and in five patients ES was considered inappropriate. ES was attempted in 88 patients and was successful in 75 (85 %). Of the 13 patients <b>failing</b> <b>ES</b> or stone removal, surgery was performed in nine and four were stented. Of patients having successful ES (n = 75), ten were referred for surgery because of incomplete duct clearance. Surgery was performed to obtain duct clearance in 19 patients (eight male, 11 female, median age 77 years, range 47 - 90 years). Of the 19, eight had previously undergone a cholecystectomy (42 %) and 17 of the 19 had biliary tract drainage preoperatively (90 %). The procedures performed consisted of choledocholithotomy in all plus cholecystectomy (11), choledochoduodenostomy (7) and choledochojejunostomy (7). There were no deaths and only one major complication. The median total inpatient stay was 26 days (range 14 - 75 days) and the median postoperative stay was 12 days (range 7 - 50 days). We would conclude that open surgery can be performed safely and effectively in elderly patients with retained bile duct stones...|$|R
40|$|In 1985 the EU Agricultural Policy {{recognised}} {{the negative}} impact that intensification was having on biodiversity across the agrarian landscape. Environmental Stewardship (ES) is the current iteration of Agri-Environment Scheme (AES) {{with the aim of}} conserving farmland biodiversity. Despite the implementation of ES many farmland species still record declining populations, which has prompted criticism that <b>ES</b> is <b>failing</b> to fulfil its goals and is poor value for money. This study aims to evaluate the impact of an ES scheme on the composition and species richness of vascular plants at a farm in East Prawle, South Devon. In 2002 a survey of the East Prawle site was undertaken along field margins, which were divided into contiguous 30 m transects spanning the entire boundary of each field. In 2014 this study used the same methodology to repeat the surveys. Arable and grassland fields managed under combined Entry Level (ELS) and Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) were contrasted with similar control fields under conventional management. Ellenberg values were applied as bio-indicators of the sites fertility (N) status. Each aspect was analysed for temporal comparisons between 2002 and 2014. Over the 12 years a significant decline (P< 0. 05) in species richness occurred across both the Test farm, managed under ES and the conventionally managed Control farm. Nonetheless in both 2002 and 2014 species richness on the Test farm was found to be significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than at the Control. Evaluation of land use between 2002 and 2014 disclosed no significant change (P< 0. 05) in species richness on any land type at the Test farm but a significant decline (P< 0. 05) in species richness on arable land at the Control farm. This resulted in arable land on the Test farm being of significantly greater (P< 0. 05) species richness tha n on the Control. Of particular interest is the reversion of arable land to permanent pasture as specified under ES. This arable reversion is of significantly (P< 0. 05) greater species richness than arable reversion on the Control farm, which is part of rotation. Between 2002 and 2014 the Test farm experienced a significant reduction (P< 0. 05) in Ellenberg fertility value, believed to be due to the ES stipulation for decreased fertiliser applications. As a result three species (Plantago lanceolata, Vicia sativa, & Senecio jacobaea) with Ellenberg values of four, increased by over 20 percentage points. There are notable composition changes on both farms between 2002 and 2014 however this study shows that ES has not caused increased species richness, or benefited plants of conservation concern, or established the target species rich maritime grassland. The study recognises that ES is unlikely to produce species rich habitats within the 10 year duration of most ES agreements and emphasises the need for extended durations as well as frequent monitoring to establish trends at field, farm and landscape scale...|$|R
40|$|Choosing {{a school}} for the {{secondary}} students {{is not a simple}} task nowadays since there are many factors needed to be considered by parents. These might be an overhead to the parents to filter each school and try to sort it out based on their requirements. Therefore, a predictive model which is a quantitative research that implemented artificial intelligence (AI) strategy using Naïve Bayes (NB) technique been applied in order to predict the chosen secondary school in Gombak based on parents’ preferences. Through six different independent variables (IV) namely distance of home from school (DSH), sibling enrolment in the same school (SE), highest parent’s level of education (PLE), household income (<b>HI),</b> employment status (<b>ES)</b> and race, 64 prediction models were produced and tested. Among all these models, the highest accuracy detected was the combination of four IVs which are DSH, PLE, ES and race, that resulted more than 55 % of accuracy. This finding then implemented into a system which is Prediction of Secondary Public School System (PSPSS) to help parents making school selection easier since parents’ concerns are taken into consideration. NB provided a new way of solving a problem in determining the vital factors for making a school choice. Since this is the preliminary and exploratory study, the highlighted achievement is not the accuracy percentage of the prediction, but a new angle on the ability of how AI can solve the problem within the domain of this study. This finding can be further improved by using the same technique which is NB through modification of IV used and the number of data collected. Other AI techniques such as support vector machine (SVM), multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) also can be used to compare with the current NB as well as an enhancement to readily available findings. This study also may be broadened to other regions or states to help more parents making school selection easier...|$|R

Ecosystem {{services}} (ES) mapping is attracting growing interest from landscape and urban planning, but its operationalization in actual decision-making is still limited. A {{clear distinction between}} ES capacity, flow and demand can improve the usefulness of ES mapping as a decision-support tool by informing planners and policy-makers where ES are used unsustainably and where <b>ES</b> flow is <b>failing</b> to meet societal demand. This paper advances a framework for mapping and assessing the relationships between ES capacity, flow and demand {{with a focus on}} the identification of unsatisfied demand. The framework was tested in the Barcelona metropolitan region, Spain, considering two ES of critical relevance for the urban population: air purification and outdoor recreation. For both ES, spatial indicators of capacity, flow, demand and unsatisfied demand were developed using proxy- and process-based models. The results show a consistent spatial pattern of all these components along the urban-rural gradient for the two ES assessed. The flow of both ES mainly takes place in the periurban green areas whereas the highest capacity values are mostly found in the protected areas located {{on the outskirts of the}} metropolitan region. As expected, ES demand and particularly unsatisfied demand are mostly situated in the main urban core (i. e., Barcelona and adjacent cities). Our assessment also reveals that the current landscape planning instrument for the metropolitan region mostly protects areas with high capacity to provide ES, but might lead to declining ES flows in periurban areas due to future urban developments. We contend that the mapping of ES capacity, flow and demand can contribute to the successful integration of the ES approach in landscape and urban planning because it provides a comprehensive picture of the ES delivery process, considering both ecological and social underlying factors. However, we identify three main issues that should be better addressed in future research: (1) improvement of ES demand indicators using participatory methods; (2) integration of ecological thresholds into the analysis; and (3) use of a multi-scale approach that covers both the local and regional planning levels and cross-scale interactions between them...|$|R
