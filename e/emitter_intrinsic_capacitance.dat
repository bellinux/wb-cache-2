It is shown that spatial dispersion {{results in an}} <b>intrinsic</b> (material-dependent) transmission-line <b>capacitance.</b> Spatial dispersion is numerically unimportant in metal nanowires, but leads to a shift in propagation constant of a few percent for CNTs and semiconducting nanowires. Theoretically, spatial dis-persion is important for both nanowires and nanotubes, and is necessary to preserve the inductance–capacitance–velocity relation, where is kinetic inductance, is <b>intrinsic</b> <b>capacitance,</b> and is electron Fermi velocity. It is shown {{that in order to}} obtain the correct <b>intrinsic</b> <b>capacitance,</b> it is necessary to use a charge-conserving form of the relaxation-time approxi-mation to Boltzmann’s equation.

40|$|We {{present a}} circuit-compatible compact {{model of the}} <b>intrinsic</b> <b>capacitances</b> of {{graphene}} field-effect transistors (GFETs). Together with a compact drain current model, a large-signal model of GFETs is developed combining both models {{as a tool for}} simulating the electrical behavior of graphene-based integrated circuits, dealing with the DC, transient behavior, and frequency response of the circuit. The drain current model is based in a drift-diffusion mechanism for the carrier transport coupled with an appropriate field-effect approach. The <b>intrinsic</b> <b>capacitance</b> model consists of a 16 -capacitance matrix including self-capacitances and transcapacitances of a four-terminal GFET. To guarantee charge conservation, a Ward-Dutton linear charge partition scheme has been used. The large-signal model has been implemented in Verilog-A, being compatible with conventional circuit simulators and serving as a starting point toward the complete GFET device model that could incorporate additional non-idealities.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the capability of}} our previously published undoped Double-Gate (DG) MOSFET explicit and analytical compact model to also forecast {{the effect of the}} volume inversion (VI) on the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>capacitances.</b> For that purpose, we present simulation results for these capacitances. We show now that the model presents an accurate dependence on the silicon layer thickness, consistent with two-dimensional numerical simulations, for both thin and thick silicon films. As opposed to our previous work, here we test the capacitance model for three different film thicknesses and also show that the transition from VI regime to dual gate behaviour is well simulated. We demonstrate in this paper that even if the current drive and transconductance are enhanced in VI regime, our results show that <b>intrinsic</b> <b>capacitances</b> are higher as well, which may limit the high-speed (delay time) behaviour of DG MOSFETs under VI regime.

40|$|A nondissipative supercurrent {{state of}} a Josephson {{junction}} is metastable {{with respect to}} the formation of a finite-resistance state. This transition is driven by fluctuations, thermal at high temperatures and quantum at low temperatures. We evaluate the life time of such a state due to quantum fluctuations in the limit when the supercurrent is approaching the critical current. The decay probability is determined by the instanton action for the superconducting phase difference across the junction. At low temperatures, dynamics of the phase is massive and is determined by the effective capacitance, which is a sum of the geometric and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>capacitance</b> of the junction. We model {{the central part of the}} Josephson junction either by an arbitrary short mesoscopic conductor described by the set of its transmission coefficients, or by a diffusive wire of an arbitrary length. The <b>intrinsic</b> <b>capacitance</b> can generally be estimated as C_* ∼ G/E_g, where G is the normal-state conductance of the junction and E_g is the proximity minigap in its normal part.
