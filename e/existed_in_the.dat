5|$|As the Internet grew in {{popularity}} and its traffic {{was required to}} be routed into private networks, the TCP/IP protocols replaced existing local area network technologies. Additional technologies, such as DHCP, allowed TCP/IP-based computers to self-configure in the network.

The route of the highway has been altered since its designation, including rerouting due {{to the construction of}} Cooper Lake.|$|E

30|$|After the {{construction}} of the gender-specific thesaurus, two new features are constructed based on the frequency and universality of the use of words <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gender-specific thesaurus. The frequency refers to how many words <b>in</b> <b>the</b> user’s word set <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gender-specific thesaurus. Universality refers to how many distinct words <b>in</b> <b>the</b> user’s word set <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gender-specific thesaurus. A total of W words were obtained after segmenting user i’s dataset, wherein EWM is the number of all <b>the</b> words that <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> male-specific thesaurus, and Distinct_EWF is the number of distinct words that <b>exist</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> male-specific thesaurus. If we perform the same operation based on the female-specific thesaurus, we can gain EWF and Distinct_EWF.|$|R

5|$|Modern apskritys {{should not}} be {{confused}} with apskritys that <b>existed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> independent Lithuania during the interwar period. At that time Lithuania had a two-step administrative division: apskritys that were subdivided into valsčius. Lithuania now has a three-step division: counties, municipalities, and elderates (apskritys, savivaldybės, and seniūnijos). See subdivisions of Lithuania for details.|$|E

50|$|Unger {{explains}} that much criticism of liberalism {{is directed at}} liberal doctrine only as it <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> order of ideas, a level of discourse in which one can fruitfully apply the methods and procedures of formal logic. However, a full review of liberalism requires that it be examined not only as it <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> order of ideas, {{but also as a}} form of social life, one that <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> realm of consciousness. Studying liberalism as it <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> realm of consciousness is not an inquiry susceptible of formal logical analysis; rather, a different method must be employed, one suited to symbolic analysis. Unger describes the method needed as a method of appositeness or symbolic interpretation.|$|R

5|$|The first {{incarnation}} of M-68 <b>existed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upper Peninsula before being absorbed into M-35. The current designation {{was created in}} 1936. A segment of highway once used by US Highway23 (US23) was incorporated into the trunkline as a discontinuous section in the early 1940s until it was later connected in 1946.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of {{discovery}} in 2001, 47 Ursae Majoris was already known to host one extrasolar planet, designated 47 Ursae Majoris b. Further measurements of the radial velocity revealed another periodicity in the data unaccounted for by the first planet. This periodicity {{could be explained by}} assuming that a second planet, designated 47 Ursae Majoris c, <b>existed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system with an orbital period close to 7 years. Observations of the photosphere of 47 Ursae Majoris suggested that the periodicity could not be explained by stellar activity, making the planet interpretation more likely. The planet was announced in 2002.|$|E

Muslim families were still living in Greece during Otto's reign, since hostility was mainly against the Ottoman state and its depressive mechanisms and not against Muslim people.|$|E
5|$|Chariots <b>existed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Minoan civilization, as {{they were}} {{inventoried}} on storage lists from Knossos in Crete, dating to around 1450 BC.

The high point of chariot use in China was in the Spring and Autumn period (770476 BC), although they continued in use up until the 2nd century BC.|$|E

Some of the many farms such as Orish Mere Farm and Hursthead Farm which covered the area also retain their names in schools that were built in their place.|$|E
5|$|Different factions {{may have}} <b>existed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> royal court. The k'uhul ahaw and his {{household}} would have formed the central power-base, but other important groups were the priesthood, the warrior aristocracy, and other aristocratic courtiers. Where ruling councils existed, as at Chichen Itza and Copán, these may have formed an additional faction. Rivalry between different factions {{would have led}} to dynamic political institutions as compromises and disagreements were played out. In such a setting, public performance was vital. Such performances included ritual dances, presentation of war captives, offerings of tribute, human sacrifice, and religious ritual.|$|E

Repeat photography of the glaciers, such as the pictures taken of Grinnell Glacier between 1938 and 2009 as shown, help to provide visual confirmation of the extent of glacier retreat.|$|E
