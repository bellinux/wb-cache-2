5|$|Ciudad Juárez, {{defended by}} 700 troops, was {{surrounded}} on three sides, {{with the only}} possible exit route for the besieged federales being the northern path into El Paso and the US. Despite {{the fact that the}} revolutionaries had cut off the water supplies <b>into</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> the garrison was low on ammunition, its commander, Gen. Juan N. Navarro, refused to surrender, convinced that the inexperience of the rebels in laying sieges would allow him to hold out.|$|E
5|$|The group, {{with the}} legal {{authority}} and financial assistance of SirDoi, buy {{the help of the}} town of Ochiai {{in order to create a}} trap. They also enlist the help of Makino, a minor lord whose daughter-in-law was raped and son murdered by Naritsugu. With troops, Makino blocks the official highway, forcing Naritsugu to head <b>into</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> the trap. During the assassins' own journey to the town, they are attacked by ronin who have been paid off by Hanbei to kill the plotters. The group decides to head through the mountains but end up getting lost. In the process they encounter a hunter named Kiga Koyata who becomes their guide; Shinzaemon eventually recruits him as the thirteenth assassin.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} locations {{featured in the}} Kanon story, though the location names are seldom mentioned explicitly in Key's works. The events of the story occur during winter, and since it often snows periodically {{over the course of}} the entire story, the city is always presented covered in a layer of snow. The shopping district is featured throughout the story when the characters go <b>into</b> <b>town,</b> <b>and</b> especially whenever Ayu appears in the early story. The high school where Yuichi and the other main characters attend, including the school grounds, is shown predominantly in Shiori's and Mai's stories, and is otherwise a general setting where Yuichi interacts with other characters.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland Road {{continues}} east running near Ashley {{and into}} Saginaw County. In between Ashley {{and the county}} line, the highway crosses {{a branch of the}} Great Lakes Central Railroad. M-57 follows Brady Road and crosses M-52 just west of Chesaning. Further east, the trunkline crosses another line of the Great Lakes Central. The highway follows Broad Street <b>into</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> over the Shiawassee River. On the east banks, M-57 runs along Main Street south along the river to a junction with Peet Road where it then turns east along the latter road out of town. The highway passes through more farm fields and through Layton Corners {{on the way to a}} junction with M-13 on the Saginaw–Genesee county line. At Montrose, M-57 crosses the Flint River, and a line of the Huron and Eastern Railway. Now running along Vienna Road, the trunkline meets I-75/US23 west of Clio. As it enters town, it crosses a line of the Saginaw Bay Southern Railway. This segment of the highway passes through the northernmost suburbs of Flint, and this section is where the heaviest traffic levels along the whole highway are found. As part of its maintenance duties, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks these traffic levels using a metric known as average annual daily traffic (AADT). This figure is a calculation of the average traffic volume for a segment of roadway on any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT determined that an average of 22,280vehicles used the section of M-57 through Clio daily. East of this area, the highway once again passes through rural agricultural lands on the way to its eastern terminus at M-15, one mile (1.6km) north of Otisville. This terminal section of the trunkline had the lowest traffic levels in 2009 at 3,737vehicles AADT. No section of M-57 has been listed on the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Mariam {{lives in}} a kolba on the {{outskirts}} of Herat with her embittered mother. Jalil, her father, is a wealthy businessman who owns a cinema and lives in the town with three wives and nine children. Mariam is his illegitimate daughter, and she is prohibited to live with them, but Jalil visits her every Thursday. On her fifteenth birthday, Mariam wants her father to take her to see Pinocchio at his movie theater, against the pleas of her mother. When he does not show up, she hikes <b>into</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> goes to his house. He refuses to see her, and she ends up sleeping on the street. In the morning, Mariam returns home to find that her mother has committed suicide out of fear that her daughter had deserted her. Mariam is then taken to live in her father's house. Jalil arranges for her to be married to Rasheed, a shoemaker from Kabul who is thirty-years her senior. In Kabul, Mariam becomes pregnant seven successive times, but is never able to carry a child to term. This is a sad, disquieting reality for both Rasheed and Mariam. Ultimately Rasheed grows more and more despondent over his wife's inability to have a child and particularly a son. As their marriage wears on Rasheed gradually becomes more and more abusive.|$|E
5|$|The promotional {{phase of}} the {{gameplay}} mainly deals with the idol conversing with various other characters and doing events, {{some of which are}} necessary to progress the game. There are also times when the player is given choices that directly affect the idol. Over the course of a conversation, text progression pauses when the player is given multiple responses to choose from. Depending on which choice is made will effect how well or poorly the communication is received, which results in either bad, normal or good memories. A bad memory will decrease an idol's enthusiasm, which is displayed at certain points throughout gameplay by a horizontal bar in the top-left of the lower screen. An idol's enthusiasm ranges from blue to yellow and finally to red as enthusiasm increases. A normal memory will reward the player with a heart point, used later during auditions. A good memory will reward the player with two heart points and increased enthusiasm. If the player chooses to take the day off, an idol's enthusiasm will automatically increase. Days off also give the idol the chance to either stay at home, or go out <b>into</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> meet with other characters. The player can check on days off if there are any presents fans have sent the idols, which contain in-game items.|$|E

The following day, General James Wilkinson accepted possession of New Orleans for the United States. A similar ceremony was held in St. Louis on March 9, 1804, when a French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing the Spanish national flag. The following day, Captain Amos Stoddard of the First U.S. Artillery marched his troops <b>into</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> had the American flag run up the fort's flagpole.

Initially, Crawford and his cavalry attempted to flee from the eastern border of Alton, but were routed back <b>into</b> <b>town</b> <b>and</b> to the south (heading directly for Winchester) by Parliamentary horse.
