5|$|The G2's audio {{hardware}} and software is optimized to support 24-bit/192 kHz audio; during LG's press event, ringtones recorded by the Vienna Boys' Choir (which are also bundled with the device) were used to demonstrate the high quality audio from its <b>internal</b> <b>speaker.</b> The G2 also includes a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera with optical image stabilization, and an infrared emitter which allows it {{to serve as a}} universal remote with the accompanying QuickRemote app.|$|E
500|$|The Sinclair models {{featured}} audio line in and out, in {{the form}} of an [...] "ear" [...] and [...] "mic" [...] socket. An external tape recorder was needed to load the majority of software released, or the ZX Microdrive. Either socket could be connected to headphones or an amplifier as an audio output, although this would not disable the <b>internal</b> <b>speaker.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Wii Remote is {{the primary}} {{controller}} for the console. It uses a combination of built-in accelerometers and infrared detection to sense its position in 3D space when pointed at the LEDs in the Sensor Bar. This design allows users to control the game with physical gestures as well as button-presses. The controller connects to the console using Bluetooth with an approximate [...] range, and features rumble and an <b>internal</b> <b>speaker.</b> [...] An attachable wrist strap {{can be used to}} prevent the player from unintentionally dropping (or throwing) the Wii Remote. Nintendo has since offered a stronger strap and the Wii Remote Jacket to provide extra grip and protection.|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero III was bundled {{with newly}} {{developed}} wireless guitar controllers for the console releases, though previous controllers from other Guitar Hero games could be used. Lee Guinchard, RedOctane's {{vice president of}} hardware, stated that wireless controllers were the [...] "first, foremost consideration" [...] for the game. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version of the controller was modeled after a black Les Paul guitar, with faceplates that can be swapped out. The PlayStation 3 version requires a dongle to achieve wireless capabilities. The Wii version is also a Les Paul design, but features a special slot to insert the Wii Remote into. [...] This slot allows the game to offer several features exclusive to the console, such as by using the <b>internal</b> <b>speaker</b> and rumble on the Remote to provide feedback on missed notes and Star Power. The PlayStation 2 guitar {{is based on a}} Kramer Striker model, and also uses a dongle to achieve wireless functionality. All models features a detachable guitar neck that would make it easier to transport the controller. The PC and Mac versions of the game are bundled with the same USB-based Gibson X-plorer model that shipped with Guitar Hero II.|$|E
500|$|The package {{illustration}} for Fate of Atlantis {{was inspired}} by the Indiana Jones movie posters of Drew Struzan. It was drawn by Eaken within three days, following disagreements with the marketing department and an external art director over which concept to use. Clint Bajakian, Peter McConnell and Michael Land created the soundtrack for the game, arranging John Williams' main theme [...] "The Raiders March" [...] for a variety of compositions. The DOS version uses sequenced music played back by either an <b>internal</b> <b>speaker,</b> the FM synthesis of an AdLib or Sound Blaster sound card, or the sample-based synthesis of a Roland MT-32 sound module. During development of the game, William Messner-Loebs and Dan Barry wrote a Dark Horse Comics series based on Barwood's and Falstein's story, then titled Indiana Jones and the Keys to Atlantis. In an interview, Eaken mentioned hour-long meetings of the development team {{trying to come up with}} a better title than Fate of Atlantis, though the staff members could never think of one and always ended up with names such as [...] "Indiana Jones Does Atlantis". The final title was Barwood's idea, who first had to convince the company's management and the marketing team not to simply call the game [...] "Indy's Next Adventure".|$|E
50|$|In general, the Mega PC {{was seen}} as a better-built device than Sega's TeraDrive, as the unit was more robust and had more {{efficient}} air circulation. The Mega PC was IBM-compatible and had a Mega Drive ISA card, a Mega Drive Controller, Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor, Joystick and <b>Internal</b> <b>Speakers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|PX-5S (2013) - A stage ready {{variation}} of the PX-350, the PX-5S adds tone editing and controller capabilities and a new Ivory Touch keybed.

The PX-5S weighs under 25 lbs., holding {{the distinction of being}} the lightest stage piano ever manufactured.|$|R
25|$|Most DAPs are {{powered by}} {{rechargeable}} batteries, {{some of which}} are not user-replaceable. They have a 3.5mm stereo jack; music can be listened to with earbuds or headphones, or played via an external amplifier and speakers. Some devices also contain <b>internal</b> <b>speakers,</b> through which music can be listened to, although these built-in speakers are typically of very low quality.|$|R
2500|$|LeChuck's Revenge was {{the first}} title to use Michael Land's and Peter McConnell's iMUSE audio {{sequencing}} MIDI engine that enabled the compositions in the game to change interactively depending on the current environment or situation. Its capabilities are extensively explored in the game, with progressive music arrangements adapting to the story on screen {{for most of the}} game, and with logical transitions from one piece to another. For instance, the first town of Woodtick has its own theme, but every location or character the player visits within the town will produce seamless variations on the town theme, introducing new melodies, instruments, or changing the arrangement of the piece completely. [...] The DOS version uses a variation on the MIDI system, played back by either an <b>internal</b> <b>speaker,</b> the FM synthesis of an AdLib or Sound Blaster sound card, or any other soundbank of an external, MIDI-compatible source, such as that of a Roland MT-32 sound module popular at the time. It's important to note that all MIDI files used by the game were recordings of hand-played performances over a MIDI controller, adding to the lively feeling of the soundtrack.|$|E

50|$|The Pianet L has a stepped {{rectangular}} case profile with no lid. It has black {{tubular steel}} legs that mount to {{the underside of}} the case. It has a black painted aluminium fascia panel below the keys. This panel also performs the key levelling function. The keys are injection moulded plastic. It has a transistorised pre-amplifier and amplifier and a knee lever for volume control. It plays through two small <b>internal</b> <b>speakers</b> or through an external amplifier.Available as model L - mains voltage, and model LB - powered by 5 'D' batteries.|$|R
50|$|GPIO pins have no {{predefined}} purpose, and go unused by default. The idea is {{that sometimes}} a system integrator who is building a full system might need a handful of additional digital control lines—and having these available from a chip avoids having to arrange additional circuitry to provide them. For example, the Realtek ALC260 chips (audio codec) have 8 GPIO pins, which go unused by default. Some system integrators (Acer Inc. laptops) use the first GPIO (GPIO0) on the ALC260 {{to turn on the}} amplifier for the laptop's <b>internal</b> <b>speakers</b> and external headphone jack.|$|R
5|$|The iPad has two <b>internal</b> <b>speakers</b> {{reproducing}} {{left and}} right channel audio located on the bottom-right of the unit. In the original iPad, the speakers push sound through two small sealed channels leading to the three audio ports carved into the device, while the iPad 2 has its speakers behind a single grill. A volume switch {{is on the right}} side of the unit. A 3.5-mm TRRS connector audio-out jack on the top-left corner of the device provides stereo sound for headphones with or without microphones and/or volume controls. The iPad also contains a microphone that can be used for voice recording.|$|R

5000|$|Half-duplex speakerphones only allow {{sound to}} travel in one {{direction}} at a time, either: 1) into the speakerphone from the telephone line and out of its <b>internal</b> <b>speaker</b> to its user, or 2) from its user, into the microphone, and out through the telephone line. While the users of the speakerphone are speaking, the phone only transmits sound to the telephone line; its <b>internal</b> <b>speaker</b> is cut off and no sound arriving from the telephone line can be heard by the user. While the user of the speakerphone is quiet, the speakerphone only receives sound from the telephone line and its <b>internal</b> <b>speaker</b> broadcasts that sound to its user. There is a very definite, noticeable switching action each time the phone [...] "changes directions" [...] and a cough or other transient noise in the room may interrupt incoming sound from {{the far end of}} the telephone connection.|$|E
5000|$|... “Sound on/off” switch, {{or sound}} volume knob which {{adjusted}} the volume {{level of the}} <b>internal</b> piezoelectric <b>speaker</b> using a potentiometer. While the modder was at it, the speaker could {{be replaced by a}} louder one.|$|R
5000|$|Pietrzak {{performed}} the song {{at the stage}} of his own political Kabaret pod Egidą as an ending theme. When the censors forbade the Cabaret to do an encore of it, it became habitual that it was sung by the audience. It gained popularity in the following years, with people copying it on tape recorders, and - during the emergence of Solidarity in 1980, it was often played from the workers radio stations and <b>internal</b> <b>speakers.</b> In June 1981 Pietrzak {{performed the}} song at the 19th National Festival of Polish Song in Opole, winning first-prize awards for the [...] "hit song of the season" [...] and [...] "the audience choice." ...|$|R

5000|$|The next {{development}} was {{to produce a}} base frequency, and then modulating it with analog filters to create desired effects; this process of audio waveform synthesis using frequency modulation is usually referred to as FM synthesis. This technology {{was introduced in the}} early 1980s by Yamaha, which began manufacturing FM synth boards for Japanese computers such as the NEC PC-8801 and PC-9801 in the early 1980s. This allowed personal computer game audio to have greater complexity than the simplistic beeps from <b>internal</b> <b>speakers.</b> These FM synth boards produced a [...] "warm and pleasant sound" [...] that musicians such as Yuzo Koshiro and Takeshi Abo utilized to produce video game music that is still highly regarded within the chiptune community.|$|R
50|$|Surface {{devices have}} an <b>internal</b> {{microphone}} and <b>speakers</b> optimized for the Cortana intelligent personal assistant feature included on Windows 10 devices.|$|R
5000|$|Beyond arcade games, {{significant}} improvements to personal computer game music were made {{possible with the}} introduction of digital FM synth boards, which Yamaha released for Japanese computers such as the NEC PC-8801 and PC-9801 in the early 1980s, and by the mid-1980s, the PC-8801 and FM-7 had built-in FM sound. This allowed computer game music to have greater complexity than the simplistic beeps from <b>internal</b> <b>speakers.</b> These FM synth boards produced a [...] "warm and pleasant sound" [...] that musicians such as Yuzo Koshiro and Takeshi Abo utilized to produce music that is still highly regarded within the chiptune community. The widespread adoption of FM synthesis by consoles would later be one of the major advances of the 16-bit era, by which time 16-bit arcade machines were using multiple FM synthesis chips.|$|R
