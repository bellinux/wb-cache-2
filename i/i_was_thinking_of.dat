At the time of the original, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> a sequel. It got as far as a character design for that sequel, but it didn't happen for various reasons. But since fans have a say in such matters, your input is greatly appreciated.|$|E
500|$|While Juskalian {{was held}} in Nuremberg, the Americans began their {{bombardment}} of the city. He describes the moment in his own words: [...] "We were cheering, and our guards were getting irritated, but the bombs came down on us, too, and I was sure {{we were going to}} get it. About 30 of us were killed. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> my mother and how ironic it would be to be killed at the end of the war—and by your own aircraft." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{defeating}} Nikolay Davydenko at Wimbledon 2012, Murray pointed upwards {{with both}} hands and wagged them back and forth while looking to the sky. Murray declined to reveal the reason, and ever since, he has continued to celebrate his victories with this gesture. Murray marked his first Wimbledon title in 2013 with the same victory salute. Then in his book 'Seventy-Seven; My Path to Wimbledon Glory', released in November 2013, Murray said: “The real reason is that around that time I had a few friends and family who had various issues affecting them [...] [...] [...] I knew that they would be watching and I wanted to let them know <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> them.” ...|$|E
500|$|Simpson {{described}} {{the process of}} writing the album's twelve songs as being similar to keeping a diary, and before the album's US release she said that [...] "My inspiration came from what I have gone through in the past three years. Every single day <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> what I was going through and would write songs about it." [...] The lyrics primarily deal with love and heartbreak; in particular, much of the album's lyrical content was inspired by Simpson's breakup with her boyfriend at the time, Josh Henderson. She has {{described the}} album as being [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "very true to my emotions"—"I wasn't afraid to say that I was hurting and how I got over it." [...] Simpson worked closely with a number of experienced songwriters on the album. The album's producer, John Shanks—who won a Grammy in February 2005, in part for his work as producer on Autobiography—receives songwriting credit alongside Simpson on all but two songs. Kara DioGuardi also receives songwriting credit, together with Simpson and Shanks, on seven of the songs, including the three singles. (See the track listing.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Shorter brought six new {{compositions}} to the Christmas Eve session. According to Shorter (as {{quoted in}} Don Heckman's liner notes), {{in writing the}} material for this album he was [...] "thinking of misty landscapes with wild flowers and strange, dimly-seen shapes — {{the kind of place}} where folklore and legends are born. And then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> things like witch burnings too." [...] Fairy tales were also an inspiration: the bluesy [...] "Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum" [...] is titled after the trademark exclamation of the giant in Jack and the Beanstalk.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, Morris married Julia Sheehan, {{whom he had}} met in Wisconsin while researching Ed Gein {{and other}} serial killers. He would later recall an early {{conversation}} with Julia: [...] "I {{was talking to a}} mass murderer but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> you," [...] he said, and instantly regretted it, afraid that it might not have sounded as affectionate as he had wished. But Julia was actually flattered: [...] "I thought, really, {{that was one of the}} nicest things anyone ever said to me. It was hard to go out with other guys after that." ...|$|E

[...] The last time they met, leaving the funeral of Dr. Rowley Pope, Jack Fingleton asked Bardsley his thoughts: [...] "I was just thinking," [...] said the old cricketer, [...] "what a great bloke old Doc was. [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> him, and then I just {{happened}} to see So-And-So across there, and I thought, Poor old So-And-So. [...] By cripes, he's looking old.

2500|$|McCartney {{was living}} in Jane Asher's parents' house when he found the {{inspiration}} for the song: [...] "I was laying in bed in the Ashers' garret... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> it as a song for Ringo, which it eventually turned out to be, so I wrote it as not too rangey in the vocal, then started making a story, sort of an ancient mariner, telling the young kids where he'd lived. It was pretty much my song as I recall... I think John helped out. The lyrics got more and more obscure as it goes on, but the chorus, melody and verses are mine." [...] The song began as being about different coloured submarines, but evolved to include only a yellow one.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Swedish magazine Bon, Robyn announced that she had plans to release three new albums in 2010. She said, [...] "I got all these great songs so why not? [...] It's been 5 years since Robyn and I didn't want to wait with a release until they are all recorded, so I decided to start putting them out right away." [...] Robyn told Popjustice journalist Peter Robinson, [...] "It's {{been a long time}} since I actually made a record! And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> how to shorten that time down and Eric, my manager, came up with the idea of what if I just start releasing songs, then I can tour them, then I can make some more songs. We started working like that. I think once it starts it will make more sense– you can just keep releasing stuff without the long breaks." [...] Robyn collaborated with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song [...] "Time Machine". Martin was responsible for producing Robyn's US breakthrough hits [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", which both charted inside the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1996 and 1997. She said of the collaboration: [...] "It was nostalgic to go back into the studio together. For me, it’s perfect timing– I’ve come full circle. It’s a way for me to show that I’m not trying to distance myself from where I come from. It’s still all about the songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Still Water (The River Thames, for Example) (1999) is {{a single}} work {{composed}} of fifteen photographic offset lithographs, each 30 1/2 x 41 1/2". It is {{in the collection of}} the Museum of Modern Art [...] It was commissioned around 1998, and Horn has noted that it came about at the same time as the end of a long love relationship. Each of the 15 lithographs features a photograph of the surface of the River Thames that has been annotated with many small white numerals that correspond to a bar of footnotes that runs along the lower border of each image. In one footnote, Horn puts a fine point on the lens through which this project looks at the river, [...] "(41) The Thames has the highest rate of suicides of any urban river. Maybe it's not the highest but it's close. It doesn't really matter because even if it doesn't, it looks like it does." [...] Horn describes these annotations as footnoting [...] "whatever <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> at the time, what the river provoked in me, and what was in the river itself." [...] The result is a mixture of poetic fragments, reports culled from interviews and newspaper clippings about deaths (primarily planned suicides) by drowning in the Thames, references to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, questions about identity and consideration of the subject of water from many different perspectives. In most cases, the photographs were taken with such exactitude that the moving surface of the water is stopped in highly detailed topographies, so that the substance of water is shown in more sculptural views than can usually be observed by the naked eye.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2009, Chakraverti {{collaborated with}} filmmaker Anjan Dutt and Sarika {{to make a}} film called The Loving Doll, with the story taken from Sacred Evil again. It will be filmed in Hindi with bits of English. Sarika plays the central {{character}} of a middle-aged woman obsessed about losing her looks. The story revolves around a married couple beset with personal problems, triggered by a doll owned by the wife. Charaverti said: [...] "After the film Sacred Evil, I have been approached by several directors for another film but the inspiration was not there. This time around there was a synchronicity— Sarika phoned me to ask if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> another film. She has long wanted to play the woman in The Loving Doll [...] Then I happened to see Madly Bangalee, and liked Anjan’s work very much. I think he has the touch {{to be able to handle}} the subject of The Loving Doll. So I contacted him and he was very interested in the project. Though he works in a very different genre from mine, I think there is empathy between his work and mine." [...] Chakraverti also said that she may play the part of a healer in the film, [...] "It’s the director’s prerogative. We will do what is best for the film." [...] In April 2010, ETV Bangla created a serial called Dibaratrir Galpo, which was based on Beloved Witch. The plot of Dibaratrir Galpo, directed by Tathagata Banerjee, centres around a dispute between two aristocratic Bengali families, but the lead character (played by Sudipta Chakraborty) was shown as a follower of Wicca who learns to develop her psychic power and uses it to counter the machinations of her enemies. Chakraverti appeared on the commercials for the serial because she felt that her deglamorised presence helped audiences in the suburbs see elderly women, who are often branded as witches, in a positive light. [...] "I felt that the story of Dibaratrir Galpo would take to esoteric ideas very well. It has a women-oriented theme and it will show how the negative aspects of the esoteric can be countered." ...|$|E
