RESULTS: The photolysis kinetics of CA 4 P solution at different concentration under the same light was different. The photolysis kinetics of CA 4 P solution at the same concentration under different light was different. Under mercury lamp, photolysis rate was increased with pH increase; under <b>daylight</b> <b>lamp,</b> photolysis rate was decreased with pH increase. The photolysis rate constant of CA 4 P in water was smaller than that in methanol, respectively (k = 0. 002 7 h- 1 and k = 0. 005 8 h- 1). The effect of β-CD,HP-β-CD,Tween 80 on the photolysis rate constant of CA 4 P was different, the sequence was as follows :kblank (1 × 10 - 6 L·mol- 1 ·h- 1) > k HP-β-CD (7 × 10 - 7 L·mol - 1 ·h- 1) = kTween 80 (7 × 10 - 7 L·mol- 1 ·h- 1) > k β-CD (6 × 10 - 7 L·mol - 1 ·h- 1).

The influences such as light sources, initial pH value, initial concentration of reactants on photodegradation efficiency of DMP were discussed.

Several light sources including <b>daylight</b> <b>lamps,</b> metal halide lamps, UV disinfecting lamp and sunlight can all be as the light sources to achieve DMP degradation. DMP degradation efficiency keeps on a high level over the range of pH 3. 0 to 5. 0 and the optimum pH is 3. 0.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to clarify the effect of spectral power distribution of different fluorescent lamps and luminance levels on the human brightness perception in a building interior. The following psychological tests were conducted. The perception of room brightness over photopic luminance ranging from 100 cd/m^ 2 to 300 cd/m^ 2 was measured for 20 subjects using a pair of experimental chambers. The daylight, warm white, incandescent colour 3 band-type, white, 3 band-type and daylight 3 band-type fluorescent lamps were used as lighting sources. Each fluorescent lamps has different S/P ratio (scotopic lumince / photopic luminance). One experimental chamber was lit by daylight fluorescent lamps and the other chamber was lit by one of the other five fluorescent lamps. After the subjects judged the brighter room, they were requested to adjust luminace level in one chamber to get equal brightness with the other. Ratios of luminance by the compared lamp to that by the <b>daylight</b> <b>lamp</b> were calculated. The following results were obtained: the subjects judge of that the fluorescent lamp with high S/P ratio is brighter than the fluorescent lamp with low S/P ratio. The differences of brightness perception between daylight flourescent lamp and the other lamps decreases with a rise in luminance level. It became clear with regression analysis that not only photopic luminance but also scotopic luminace contributes to perceped brightness in according to luminace levels.

40|$|Comparison {{was made}} between the {{fluorescent}} lamp and the incandescent lamp basing on qualitative experiments, and the following conclusion was reached. (1) In incandescent lamps when the reflection factor {{of the color of}} reflector is smaller, intensity of illumination will be so much the lower. The same tendency is seen with fluorescent lamps, but the effect is generally smaller as compared with incandescent lamps. Furthermore, when the color of reflector belongs to the same color group as the dominant wave-length of the light-source, intensity of illumination will be stronger. In case it is of the complementary hue or of the same color group, illumination comes out weaker. (2) When various artificial light-sources are mutually compared by the quantities of filtered radiation, it is found that the light of daylight and white fluorescent lamp resembles most closely the daylight in cloudy weather. In incandescent lamps, the zone of long wave-length is in excess, while the blue and violet zones can hardly be seen. (3) Even among the persons with normal sense of color, a high percentage of misreading and hard-reading of Stilling's Charts occurs under the illumination by an incandescent lamp, whereas under that of a white fluorescent lamp, the percentage is extremely lower. (4) As the color rendition of various light·sources are examined from the viewpoint of the "difference of color", de luxe daylight fluorescent lamp is most superior. Next comes de luxe white fluorescent lamp, and it further worsens in the order of the daylight fluorescent lamp, white fluorescent lamp, fluorescent filament lamp, and <b>daylight</b> <b>lamp.</b> Ordinary electric lamps are markedly inferior.

(1) There is a stright line relation between speed of seeing and logarithm of intensity of illumination, and the relation appears nearly same with each light-sources. (2) Speed of seeing increases as the intensity of illumination increases, and the rate of increase is great in low intensity of illumination and small in high.
