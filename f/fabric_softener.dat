Exploratory and experimental approaches were utilised in gathering data for this project. Yarns were spun using a spinning wheel, and subsequently a portable weaving loom was used for weaving the fabric. Fabric softeners were applied on the woven fabric, and later fabrics were evaluated for hand and potential end uses. Major findings revealed that sisal fibres treated with NaOH were successfully spun into yarns using a traditional spinning wheel with the aid of a binding agent. Yarns spun from treated fibres were finer, weaker and highly absorbent. Flexural rigidity was the only significant fabric property that was decreased for fabric made from treated fibres compared to the control fabric. The application of fabric softeners had no significant effect on fabric hand. Subsequently, potential end uses of woven fabric were identified, which included apparel and accessories.

40|$|Silicones and {{household}} cleaning applications {{have been associated}} for more than 50 years, particularly in the laundry area, where the main use is foam control in consumer washing machines and <b>fabric</b> <b>softening.</b> But silicones are also used to provide extra benefits such as fabric dewatering, antiwrinkle characteristics, ease of ironing or improved water absorbency. Silicone additives have also been developed to reduce fabric mechanical losses over time or to improve perfume release. A wide range of foam control agents exists. These foam control agents prevent (antifoams), and knock down (defoamers) foam that occurs in both the manufacture of detergents and during their use by consumers at home, or by professionals. Antifoams are critical in many consumer applications. For example, in a washing machine, a steady control of foam is needed, rather than its complete elimination or prevention. Correct foam control is essential since consumers are very perceptive about foam levels. Moreover, incorrect foam levels can reduce the detergent’s cleaning efficiency. Silicone foam control agents are based on combinations of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and finely divided silica particles. This particular combination seems most effective...|$|R

It is estimated that about 75 % of the QACs consumed annually are released into wastewater treatment systems (Ismail et al. 2010). The rinse water from hospitals, laundries and poultry processing facilities, and roof runoff are likely the point sources (Ruan et al. 2014; Tezel et al. 2007), causing transient shock loads of QACs in wastewater treatment plants. Although extensive information on the occurrence and fate of QACs in the aquatic environment has indicated that biomass sorption via ion exchange, ion pairing and/or hydrophobic bonding largely accounts for the removal of QACs in wastewater treatment plants (a low-speed degradation resulting in the accumulation of QACs in waste activated sludge) (Li et al. 2014; Tezel and Pavlostathis 2015; Zhang et al. 2015), there is limited knowledge on the subsequent microbial behaviors on exposure to different kinds of QACs (e.g., monoalkonium and benzalkonium compounds). Recent evidence indicates that the immobilized QACs on uniform planes (e.g., membranes) could retard microbial growth through contact-killing (Chen et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2016). However, there is no detailed study on the change of cell viability and microbial metabolisms due to the acute response to QAC shock loads in MBRs treating domestic wastewater.|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecently, {{there have}} been many {{developments}} in compression sportswear and swimwear. The main purpose of compression sportswear is to keep athletes’ muscles warm to prevent muscle strain and fatigue. Now, some compression sportswear has been developed to include a joint protection function. In this study, a design method for joint torque generated by compression sportswear such as competitive swimwear and compression long running tights is proposed. Information on the joint torque generated by sportswear would be useful for compression sportswear design. The proposed method calculates stress-strain relationships of sportswear fabrics using the anisotropic hyperelastic model, and calculates the frictional displacement between the human body and sportswear using a 3 D-CG human model. In order to accurately calculate stress, anisotropic material modeling and a stress-softening model were applied to the mechanical characteristics of compression sportswear fabrics. The frictional displacement between the human body and swimwear during swimming was also considered for stress calculations. Typical sportswear fabrics exhibit anisotropic mechanical behavior depending on tensile direction. Also, the stiffness of the <b>fabrics</b> is <b>softened</b> by the maximum strain experienced in each warp and weft fiber.

30|$|Composite or {{laminated}} fabrics offer two advantages. First, they {{eliminate the}} labor involved in sequential upholstering of fabric layers, and second, they prevent exposure of underlying cushioning materials by ‘crack-opening’. When the multi-layered barrier fabric {{is exposed to}} flames, the heat is taken away by the outer coating or layer of the composite fabric, leaving the underlying substrate to which the coating or outer layer is laminated intact and preventing the involvement of underlying cushioning materials in the fire. For example, when a glass fiber fabric coated with polyvinyl chloride is exposed to flames, the polymer does not shrink away from the underlying glass fiber <b>fabric.</b> Instead, it <b>softens</b> and flows into the interstices of the glass fiber fabric. Laminated/coated fabrics eliminate the air space between the layers of barrier fabric and maintain the aesthetics of the exterior fabric while still providing better fire performance ([Schumann & Hartzell 1989]; [Decabromodiphenylether 2005]).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results of a study of {{problems}} associated with fabric sewing, such as seam pucker and sewing damage, in commercial garment manufacture. Part 1 continues previous work by the author on seam pucker in structurally jammed fabrics; in particular {{it has been shown that}} initial Young's modulus of a fabric is a measure of the ability of the fabric to accommodate compressive forces during sewing. This result provides an additional means of predicting the tendency of a fabric to exhibit seam pucker. The static mechanism of seam pucker proposed previously, based upon the relative magnitudes of bending stiffness of thread and fabric, has been revised by establishing that sewing machine dynamics and pucker are closely related. It has been shown that presser foot bouncing in particular induces pucker and that the sewing thread needs to be positively controlled during stitch formation. These results were verified by simple experimental methods, suggesting that modifications to the sewing machine are needed. Such modifications are beyond the scope of this work. Following the earlier static mechanism of seam pucker, it has been shown that seam pucker in fabrics is reduced significantly when the bending stiffness and extensibility of the sewing thread is reduced. In addition seam pucker can be eliminated by improving fabric stiffness locally along the seam area, by incorporating a stiffening material in the seam; this is based upon the technique of pucker elimination found in the author's previous work. In this study this technique is implemented with considerable success in other types of seams and commercially available stiffening materials have been selected. Part 2 investigates sewing damage to fabrics due to sewing needle penetration. Preliminary studies suggested the need for a reliable testing facility. This was made by instrumenting an industrial overlock sewing machine. The instrumentation was based on measuring the force which is exerted by the sewing needle when penetrating the fabric. The testing facility consists of the sewing machine with a strain gauged sewing needle and plate, and a shaft encoder for stitch marking, which with proper signal amplification and conditioning could be fed to a transient recorder and osciloscope for signal capturing and plotting. Investigations with fabrics revealed that the magnitude of the peak force of each stitch cycle can be related to the degree of sewing damage in the fabric. Based on these results the most important variables in sewing damage were <b>fabric</b> <b>softening</b> and its effective application during finishing, and sewing needle size. Studies of sewing damage under dynamic conditions have shown that sewing damage is a frictional problem between yarns in the fabric and between yarns and the metal of the sewing needle, foot, plate and feed dog. The size of the needle plate of the sewing machine seems to affect the degree of damage and fabric "flagging" during sewing damage has been experienced. Finally in the latter section of this study a prototype routine sewing damage tester has been developed and each stage of its development is described. This tester is based on an instrumented overlock sewing machine, which is interfaced with an IBM PC for computerised data capture and analysis in real time. ...|$|R

Detergents {{may be used}} in any form (liquid, powder, paste, bar, cake, shape, etc,) widely for household laundry products, domestic and industrial cleaners, cosmetic products, and industrial purposes. Surfactants are organic substances, used in detergents, intentionally added to achieve cleaning, rising and/or <b>fabric</b> <b>softening</b> due to its surface-active properties. They consist of one or more hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups of such nature and size that they are capable of forming micelles. Surfactants belong to a group of chemicals of high environment relevance due to their large production volumes. They are mainly discharged into the environment by the wastewater pathway, either after treatment in a wastewater treatment plant or directly where no treatment is available. Environmental compartments, which may be influenced by surfactants, are the fresh water environment (water body and sediments), the soil if surfactants loaded sewage sludge is added, and the marine environment. The wastewaters of detergent manufacturing contain high levels of inhibitory surfactants that pose appreciable impacts on the environment. In addition to industrial wastewaters, domestic wastewater also includes synthetic organic compounds like surfactants, personal-care products, additives that have severe effects on wildlife and human health due to their toxicological properties. Therefore there is a growing research need on the inhibitory effects and removal of such compounds. Linear alkyl benzene sulphonates (LAS) and sodium lauryl ether sulphate (SLES) {{play an important role in}} our everyday, since they have been announced as biodegradable and environmentally friendly surfactants compared to branched benzene sulphonates like Dodecyl Benzene Sulphonates. LAS are known as biodegradable due to the linear structure of the alkyl benzene group present in this molecular structure. However, it has also been reported that surfactants, specifically linear alkyl benzene sulphonates decrease the affinity of substrate to biomass and lower maximum growth rates are observed in the presence of surfactants. Sodium lauryl ether sulphate consists of straight carbon chains, usually 12 to 14, and, due to its more simple structure (i. e., no benzene ring), it can be more easily biodegradable than other surfactants such as LAS. Biodegradation is an important factor for reduction and removal of organic contaminants from the environment. The evaluation of biodegradability of anthropogenic organic substances is an essential parameter for environmental risk assessment and required according to appropriate legislation. In a risk assessment study it has been pointed out that the risk imposed on the aquatic by the anionic surfactants depends upon the applied treatment scheme prior to discharge of wastewater. [...] RESUMO O presente trabalho foi desenvolvido numa indústria de produtos de limpeza doméstica (LD) e higiene pessoal (HP), onde está implementada uma estação de tratamento de águas residuais industriais (ETARI). Durante o estudo foi monitorizada e avaliada a biodegradabilidade de algumas substâncias base dos detergentes (tensoactivos aniónicos), nomeadamente o LAS e o SLES, bem como o efluente da indústria nas diferentes fases de tratamento implementado na ETARI.
