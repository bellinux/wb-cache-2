40|$|This study {{examined}} antisocial and prosocial behavior of N = 439 adolescent athletes between 14 and 17 {{years of age}} (67 teams). Multilevel analyses showed that team membership explained 20 % and 13 % of <b>the</b> variance <b>in</b> antisocial and prosocial behavior <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> context, respectively. <b>The</b> team effects suggest that aggregating antisocial or prosocial adolescents within teams may partially explain differences in antisocial and prosocial behavior among athletes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> context. A trend was found towards a relation between higher levels of moral reasoning within teams and less antisocial behavior <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> context. Favorable moral atmosphere was positively associated with more prosocial behavior <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> context. Finally, supportive coach-athlete relationships were associated with both less antisocial and more prosocial behavior <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> context...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ed. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThis {{qualitative}} study used a grounded theory approach {{to analyze the}} early career experiences of graduates of sport management degree programs. Participants (n= 32) were drawn from a sample of graduates of bachelor's or master's degree programs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States within six years of graduation (2006 - 2011). Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2012 to explore the experiences of this population. Participants were asked to consider their experiences as students, practical industry experiences, and {{the process by which}} they obtained their first positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> industry. A thematic analysis revealed several factors that were identified as having a substantial impact. The factors identified were personal characteristics, academic experiences, experiences in <b>sport</b> management, internships <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> industry, and <b>the</b> influence of significant individuals. Expectations were a key element present with all identified factors. Graduates of sport management degree programs use a multi-directional and interactive approach to set expectations for their future careers in and out of <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> industry. A theory was proposed to show how factors influenced expectation setting which ultimately influenced career decisions. A flow diagram was created to explain decisional pathways that participants followed to obtain their first sports industry positions. Results indicated that participants could be divided into four categories: participants who obtained a position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> industry and remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field (n= 16), participants who obtained a full-time position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> industry and left the field (n= 3), those who obtained part-time position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> industry (n= 5), {{and those who did not}} obtain a position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> industry (n= 6). Two participants had obtained full-time positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> industry and reduced to part-time status. Participants who obtained full-time positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> industry generally remained in those positions. However, challenges existed for participants to obtain their first full-time positions. For participants who were unable to obtain positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> industry, cited barriers for entry were competition for positions and lack of sports industry network. Implications for <b>the</b> development of <b>sport</b> managers from a degree perspective and retention of sports organization employees are discussed...|$|R
