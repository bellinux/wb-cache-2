Other variables are controlled by controlling furnace operational parameters to preset schedules (e. g. melting current is ramped or held constant to control melt rate in an open loop fashion), through proper maintenance and calibration of equipment (e. g. to ensure proper cooling water and gas flow rates, or to accomplish an acceptable vacuum leak rate), through proper practice of procedures, and by maintaining electrode quality control. Electrode gap control is accomplished by controlling an electrode gap indicator such as drip-short frequency (or period) to a specified set-point.

Three innovative design thoughts are introduced here. First, the quasi-modal electrode is used as the <b>input</b> <b>electrode</b> of the piezoelectric transformer. It is shown that a full modal filtering effect is achieved. In other words, all unwanted vibration modes of the structure are suppressed, which eliminates all higher harmonics of the input voltage. The second one is {{an innovative}} rigid support design which can enhance the modal filtering effect, which {{can also be used}} to replace thin input wiring and lead to lower contact resistance. The third innovative design uses direct switching on the rectified voltage from the power line (110 / 220 V).

40|$|Vacuum arc {{remelting}} (VAR) is {{a melting}} {{process for the}} production of homogeneous ingots, achieved by applying a direct current to create electrical arcs between the <b>input</b> <b>electrode</b> and the resultant ingot. Arc behavior drives quality of the end product, but no methodology is currently used in VAR furnaces at large scale to track arcs in real time. An arc position sensing (APS) technology was recently developed as a methodology to predict arc locations using magnetic field values measured by sensors. This system couples finite element analysis of VAR furnace magnetostatics with direct magnetic field measurements to predict arc locations. However, the published APS approach did not consider the effect of various practical issues that could affect the magnetic field distribution and thus arc location predictions. In this paper, we studied how altering assumptions made in the finite element model affect arc location predictions. These include the vertical position of the sensor relative to the electrode-ingot gap, a varying electrode-ingot gap size, ingot shrinkage, and the use of multiple sensors rather than a single sensor. Among the parameters studied, only vertical distance between arc and sensor locations causes large sources of error, and should be considered further when applying an APS system. However, averaging the predicted locations from four evenly spaced sensors helps reduce this error to no more than 16 % for a sensor position varying from 0. 508 m below and above the electrode-ingot gap height...|$|E

Such an interest is mainly due to a growing need to develop new devices able to contactlessly record human vital parameters for clinical and healthcare purposes. At the same time, military and humanitarian activities have renewed the desire of having human presence identification systems based on biological parameters, both for security and rescue activities. The aim of this research is to provide a potential solution to those needs by investigating the deployment of a new electrostatically enhanced displacement current sensing technique for detection human bio-activity related signals. The investigation started with identification and analysis of the problems with currently available techniques, and the potential solutions provided by other research groups as described in the literature. Once the signals to be detected were identified, notably electrophysiological signals related to human’s heart and muscles activities, as well as other body-movement linked electric variations, an exhaustive analysis and characterization of such signals were performed. This was followed by system specifications, design and development of our new displacement current sensor started. This thesis describes a newly developed low-cost displacement current sensor for non-contact, non-invasive detection of electrophysiological and other bio-activity related signals, well suited for applications requiring remote and portable means for detection of human presence. The sensor consists of an <b>input</b> <b>electrode</b> forming the sensor head or antenna, an amplification stage employing a simple improvised trans-impedance amplifier, and a filtering stage. It operates by detecting the displacement current induced between the human body and the sensor’s antenna, by heart and muscle movement related signals of the subject, and further enhanced by the presence of an electrostatically charged dielectric layer at the front of the sensor’s electrode. Reported results, obtained in normal unshielded environment, demonstrate the sensor’s remarkable capability in recording heart related bio-activity signals at off-body distance up to 0. 4 m, and skeletal muscle movement related bio-activity signals within 10 m off-body distance with no obstacle in between, and 5 m off-body distance with a non-metallic concrete wall in between. These positive and encouraging performance figures stimulated our interest in further developing the sensor into a prototype for a human presence detection system that is able to provide a 2 D image reconstruction of the subject shape, by utilizing an array of 25 identical units of the same sensor.

This collection of work demonstrates design principles and examples in the following four areas: manufacturing, customizable computer aided design, fabrication with physical manipulation and multi-modal sensing techniques. Two types of manufacturing methods are used and characterized. The first approach customizes the sensing design in a digital environment, where users define the geometry, shape and sensing inputs in a computer and print out customized functional patterns. The second approach is sensor fabrication via physical manipulation, where the sensate surface is premanufactured and through an additive method (paneling linear sensor tape stripes), or a subtractive method (cutting a sensor sheet), and the shape and sensing targets are processed post-manufacturing. Lastly, I demonstrate three techniques for multimodal sensing - designing "target specific shapes" for different sensing targets, multiplexing single <b>input</b> <b>electrodes</b> with various analog circuits for near surface sensing (pressure, touch, folding, proximity sensing), and adding extra layers of chemical for the designed ad-hoc sensing target alteration. The outcome of this exploration combines emerging technologies to realize a new way of designing sensate surfaces for smart environments and objects and helps us rethink sensing as both a graphical design and a physical manipulation process. In the course of this thesis, I demonstrate these principals by designing, testing, and evaluating a variety of flexible sensate surfaces. by Nan-Wei Gong. Thesis: Ph.

30|$|Six healthy young {{subjects}} (one {{female and}} five males) aged between 24 and 32, {{participated in this}} pilot study (the first subject was excluded due to a different procedural method). The EEG recordings were done using four electrodes. The unipolar reference electrode was placed at the left earlobe, a ground electrode at Fpz, an electrooculography (EOG) electrode below the left eye, and a measurement electrode at Pz. These positions {{were in accordance with}} the 10 - 20 international standard of EEG electrode placement. A fifth <b>electrode</b> <b>input</b> was activated as a trigger channel. Each time a stimulus was presented to the user, a trigger was set as a simultaneous time-stamp to the EEG.|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} multichannel recordings from freely behaving {{animals and the}} need to develop a practical brain-machine interface has fuelled the development of miniature multichannel recording systems. Here we describe our prototype miniature 64 -channel acquisition system {{that could be used for}} multichannel recordings in freely behaving monkeys or other large animals. The system's features include an high impedance <b>input</b> for neurophysiology <b>electrodes,</b> an integrated battery fed circuitry with a 64 low-noise multiplexed amplifiers array that permits the parallel recording of all channels, a 10 -bit resolution ADC, an FPGA digital core for online processing and data transmission, a USB 2. 0 link and a custom software for data visualization and whole system control...|$|R
