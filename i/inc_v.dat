The trial lasted seven days, during which Universal, {{represented}} by the New York firm Townley & Updike, argued that the name Donkey Kong could be confused with King Kong and that {{the plot of the}} game was an infringement on that of the film. Kirby showed key differences between Donkey Kong and King Kong. He also alleged that Universal had no rights to the King Kong characters and that they had in fact successfully sued RKO Pictures in 1975 in Universal City Studios, <b>Inc.</b> <b>v.</b> RKO General, Inc., wherein they proved that the plot of King Kong was in the public domain and thus opened the way for Dino De Laurentiis's remake.|$|E

5|$|In Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, <b>Inc.</b> <b>v.</b> Dabit (2005), Sotomayor wrote a {{unanimous}} {{opinion that the}} Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 did not preempt class action claims in state courts by stockbrokers alleging misleading inducement {{to buy or sell}} stocks. The Supreme Court handed down an 8–0 decision stating that the Act did preempt such claims, thereby overruling Sotomayor's decision.|$|E
5|$|Bowman then {{appealed the}} {{decision}} to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Bowman argued that the Monsanto license agreement allowed the sale of second-generation soybeans to both grain elevators and subsequent buyers and that this caused the patent rights to be exhausted per the United States Supreme Court's ruling in Quanta Computer, <b>Inc.</b> <b>v.</b> LG Electronics, Inc. Monsanto argued that the license agreement specifically prohibited the use of second-generation seeds for planting. The Federal Circuit upheld the lower court's decision in favor of Monsanto.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Electronic Arts and Fox Entertainment {{released}} , {{which has}} been labelled a rip-off of the Crazy Taxi formula by game reviewers.

Sega sued Fox Entertainment, Electronic Arts, and developer Radical Games Ltd. over infringement of the 138 patent. The case, Sega of America, <b>Inc.</b> <b>v.</b> Fox Interactive, et al., was settled in private for an unknown amount. The 138 patent itself remains valid, and is considered to be one of the most important patents in video game development today.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Watergate, the Ford administration was engaged {{in a number of}} conflicts with Congress. Scalia repeatedly testified before congressional committees, defending Ford administration assertions of executive privilege regarding its refusal to turn over documents. Within the administration, Scalia advocated a presidential veto for a bill to amend the Freedom of Information Act, which would greatly increase the act's scope. Scalia's view prevailed, and Ford vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode it. In early 1976, Scalia argued his only case before the Supreme Court, Alfred Dunhill of London, <b>Inc.</b> <b>v.</b> Republic of Cuba. Scalia, on behalf of the US government, argued in support of Dunhill, and that position was successful.|$|E

Tourism Company of Puerto Rico (1986), affirmed the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's conclusion that Puerto Rico's Games of Chance Act of 1948, including the regulations thereunder, was not facially unconstitutional. The lax interpretation of Central Hudson adopted by Posadas was soon restricted under 44 Liquormart, <b>Inc.</b> <b>v.</b> Rhode Island (1996), when the Court invalidated a Rhode Island law prohibiting {{the publication of}} liquor prices.|$|E

The 2007 lawsuit CBS Operations <b>Inc</b> <b>v.</b> Reel Funds International Inc. ruled that the episodes in question were derivative works based on the copyrighted episodes even though the episodes themselves were not under copyright and granted CBS indirect copyright over the public domain episodes; the ruling enjoined Reel Funds International, a public domain distributor, from selling DVDs with those episodes within {{the jurisdiction of the}} United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas.|$|E

5|$|The third case, Puyallup Tribe, <b>Inc.</b> <b>v.</b> Department of Game of Washington (Puyallup III), {{was decided}} in 1977. Members of the Puyallup Tribe filed suit, arguing {{that under the}} {{doctrine}} of sovereign immunity, Washington state courts lacked jurisdiction to regulate fishing activities on tribal reservations. Writing {{for a majority of}} the Court, Justice John Paul Stevens held that, despite the tribe's sovereign immunity, the state could regulate the harvest of steelhead trout in the portion of the river that ran through the Puyallup Reservation as long as the state could base its decision and apportionment on conservation grounds.|$|E
5000|$|From its {{establishment}} in 1933, the New Jersey Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control regularly harassed LGBT bar patrons. It interpreted a regulation preventing licensees from serving [...] "any known criminals, gangsters, racketeers, swindlers, prostitutes, female impersonators or other persons of ill repute" [...] to revoke the liquor licenses of bars serving a predominantly homosexual customer base. In 1967, A state court invalidated this interpretation in One Eleven Liquors, <b>Inc.</b> <b>vs.</b> Division of Alcoholic Beverage Commission.|$|R

[...] All subsequent legal cases have {{ruled in favor of}} Universal Life Church as a legal and valid church establishment. The US military chaplain's hand book lists Universal Life Church as a recognized church.|$|R
