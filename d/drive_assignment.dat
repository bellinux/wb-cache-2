40|$|Different {{disciplines}} require {{different approaches}} to education. The teaching of formalized sciences (such are physics, chemistry, etc.) requires the study of consolidated and already verified results and is conveniently carried out through lecturing (e. g. lectures or books) while formalisms and techniques are learned together with disciplinary contents. Soft disciplines (such are fine arts, interior design, media production, journalism, etc.) require “learning by doing”: the study of facts and techniques that is weakly related {{to the ability to}} produce masterpieces or new ideas. Design is in an intermediate position: techniques can be learned (e. g. modelling, representation, materials, colours, etc.), but the ability to design “new meanings”, i. e. creativity, is left to personal sensitivity and to teaching by examples. Creativity can be stimulated, and methods can be provided: constraints. In our experience in teaching design (in particular communication and service design) at our university, we combine theoretical lessons with many design activities, together with constraint driven activities. Constraints stimulate the lateral thinking and make students aware of their mental frames that oppose limits to their creative capacities; constraint <b>driven</b> <b>assignments</b> force the students to focus on the technical aspects, distracting their attention from the creative content so reducing “conceptual censorship”.

Also, under Windows if one is referencing a file on another partition, one can do that only by specifying the partition's assigned drive letter (or mount point)which, however, might change with time and depending on the drives installed. This renders references invalid and dependent on actual <b>drive</b> letter <b>assignment,</b> which is not an issue if one has to reference files/directories only on the same partition, as in this case one can use directory-relative or root-relative references, without including the drive/partition letter.|$|R

However, by creating a shortcut to the batch file using the above PUSHD / POPD construct, and using the shortcut to run the batch file as administrator, the temporary drive letter will be created and removed in the elevated account context, and the batch file will function correctly.|$|R
50|$|A {{common problem}} that occurs with the <b>drive</b> letter <b>assignment</b> {{is that the}} letter {{assigned}} to a network drive can interfere with the letter of a local volume (like a newly installed CD/DVD drive or a USB stick).

Users with administrative privileges can assign drive letters manually to overcome this problem.Another condition that can cause problems on Windows XP is when there are network drives defined, but in an error condition (as they would be on a laptop operating outside the network). Even when the unconnected network drive is not the next available drive letter, Windows XP {{may be unable to}} map a drive and this error may also prevent the mounting of the USB device.|$|R

Establishing common SILs for components of a large scale SPL by considering all possible usage scenarios, is desirable for economies of scale, but it also poses challenges to the safety engineering process.

50|$|Because DOS {{applications}} {{use these}} drive letters directly (unlike the /dev directory in Unix-like systems), {{they can be}} disrupted by adding new hardware that needs a drive letter. An example is {{the addition of a}} new hard drive having a primary partition where a pre-existing hard drive contains logical drives in extended partitions; the new drive will be assigned a letter that was previously assigned to one of the extended partition logical drives. Moreover, even adding a new hard drive having only logical drives in an extended partition would still disrupt the letters of RAM disks and optical drives.This problem persisted through Microsoft's DOS-based 9x versions of Windows until they were replaced by versions based on the NT line, which preserves the letters of existing drives until the user changes them.Under DOS, this problem can be worked around by defining a SUBST drive and installing the DOS program into this logical <b>drive.</b> The <b>assignment</b> of this <b>drive</b> would then be changed in a batch job whenever the application starts.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a market equilibrium model of CEO assignment, pay, and incentives under risk aversion and moral hazard. Each {{of the three}} outcomes can be summarized by a single closed-form equation. In the presence of moral hazard, assignment is distorted from positive assortative matching on firm size as firms with higher risk or disutility choose less talented CEOs. Such firms also pay higher salaries in the cross-section, but economywide increases in risk or the disutility of being a CEO do not affect pay. The strength of incentives depends only on the disutility of effort and is independent of risk and risk aversion. If the CEO can affect firm risk, incentives rise and are increasing in risk and risk aversion. We calibrate the losses from various forms of poor corporate governance, such as failures in monitoring and inefficiencies in CEO assignment.

40|$|Purpose: Many {{instruments}} {{designed to}} predict prostate cancer risk {{use a combination}} of clinical T stage, biopsy Gleason score and serum prostate specific antigen (PSA). We designed a study to characterize time trends in these parameters and their impact on patient risk stratification. Materials and Methods: Data were abstracted from CaPSURE (Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urological Research Endeavor), a disease registry of 8, 685 men with prostate cancer. The 6, 260 men diagnosed since 1989 who had complete clinical information reported were categorized into low, intermediate or high risk groups based on established parameters for T stage, Gleason score and PSA. Results: Between 1989 to 1990 and 2001 to 2002 the proportion of patients presenting with high, intermediate and low risk disease changed from 40. 9 %, 28. 0 % and 31. 2 % to 14. 8 %, 37. 5 % and 47. 7 %, respectively (p < 0. 0001). The incidence of T 1 tumors increased from 16. 7 % to 48. 5 % and that of T 3 - 4 tumors decreased from 11. 8 % to 3. 5 %, respectively (p < 0. 0001). The incidence of Gleason 2 to 6 tumors decreased from 77. 1 % to 66. 4 %, while that of Gleason 7 tumors increased from 12. 9 % to 24. 8 %, respectively (p = 0. 0030).

40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that greater hierarchical distance between a subordinate and his boss {{makes it more}} difficult to share abstract and subjective information in decision making. A novel dataset put together from credit dossiers of large corporate loan applicants enables us to observe the information collected by loan officers, and how it is used by the ultimate loan approving officer. We find that greater hierarchical/geographical distance between the information collecting agent and the loan approving officer leads to less reliance on subjective information and more on objective information. By exploiting nonlinearities in the "assignment rules" that determine an applicant's hierarchical distance, and using information collecting agent fixed effects, we show that our result cannot be <b>driven</b> by endogenous <b>assignment</b> of applicants. We also find that higher frequency of interactions between the information collecting agent and loan approving officer, both over time and through geographical proximity, helps mitigate the effects of hierarchical distance on information use. Our results show that hierarchical distance influences information use, and highlights the importance of "human touch" in communication. The Author 2009.

In a discrete event <b>driven</b> simulation, the <b>assignment</b> of logical processes (LPs) to machines is a critical step that affects the computational and communication burden on the machines, which in turn affects the simulation execution time of the experiment. We study a network partitioning game wherein each node (LP) acts as a selfish player. We derive two local node-level cost frameworks which are feasible {{in the sense that}} the aggregate state information required to be exchanged between the machines is independent of the size of the simulated network model. For both cost frameworks, we prove the existence of stable Nash equilibria in pure strategies. Using iterative partition improvements, we propose game theoretic partitioning algorithms based on the two cost criteria and show that each descends in a global cost. To exploit the distributed nature of the system, the algorithm is distributed, with each node's decision based on its local information and on a few global quantities which can be communicated machine-to-machine.

[...] University of Washington, 2014 This {{dissertation}} {{intends to}} develop an effective and complete cross-layer scheduling and resource allocation algorithm for real-time video camera networks over the OFDMA-based 4 G mobile infrastructure. There are two main parts in our research: Visual Quality Driven (VQD) scheduling as well as resource allocation for real-time surveillance video uplink (UL) transmission, and Visual Quality <b>Driven</b> resource <b>assignment</b> for real-time video through an integrated downlink (DL) and UL system over the OFDMA-based networks. In the VQD scheduling for video uplink, we propose an effective real-time video uplink (UL) framework for mobile wireless camera networks over an OFDMA-based infrastructure. Mobile wireless camera stations (CS) unicast their videos in real time to base stations (BS) and then these live video streams are fed to subscribers to facilitate real time video monitoring. Based on the visual quality driven utility function, the target bit rate resulting in the highest possible visual quality is quickly set for each UL video by our algorithm. To optimize the system performance, a real time video packet scheduler and a spectral efficient resource allocation policy are derived. This scheduler is also capable of exploiting the inherent diversity gain due to channel variations. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly enhance utility, boost spectral efficiency, and stabilize the video quality. For the integrated system, a comprehensive UL and DL framework for wireless mobile camera networks is proposed. On the UL side, this system collects unicast real-time video streams from wireless mobile camera stations (CSs) and forwards them to the social web platforms having capability to deliver live videos, such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc. On the DL side, the aggregated video streams are multicast to multiple mobile stations (MSs) to facilitate efficient distribution of these videos in real-time. Since this utility function has also taken the popularity of video contents into consideration, the number of video layers to be uploaded can be quickly determined by our resource allocation algorithm. A previously published opportunistic layered multicasting (OLM) scheduling algorithm is also applied on the DL. Simulation results prove that this proposed novel architecture of ours can significantly enhance the spectral efficiency and the users' satisfaction in both the UL and DL directions...|$|R

Demand driven dispatch is an operational mode where aircraft assignments can be changed in response to variation in demand. A computer program simulated the functions of a revenue management system and an optimal aircraft assignment routine {{over the course of}} the passenger booking process. An isolated hub with service exclusively between the hub and 15 spoke cities was assumed. Two series of quantitative studies were done, one looking at the possible profit improvements at various demand levels with demand driven dispatch and the other examining the sensitivity of demand driven dispatch results to when the first and last optimal reassignment of hub aircraft was made in the booking process. In the first series, comparisons were made between results obtained from static aircraft assignments and fully dynamic demand <b>driven</b> dispatch <b>assignments.</b> Several scenarios were simulated. These involved various combinations of demand distribution, demand balance, and booking process assumptions. Booking process sensitivity studies were performed on a small subset of the scenario combinations. A discussion of practical issues which could affect implementation is also included. Results show that demand driven dispatch performance is fairly uniform regardless of the scenario with the best projected yearly profit increases for a major hub and spoke operator of $ 35 -$ 40 million over the current fixed assignment practice. This occurred at load factors similar to airline historical levels of 65 %. The profit increases at normal demand levels were achieved mostly through better aircraft utilization patterns (lower costs) and not revenue enhancement. At higher average load factors demand driven dispatch improvement was less significant but was always positive. Studies on when demand driven dispatch was applied during the booking process showed that major benefits could be gained by evaluating assignments even once as long as this assignment period preceded any significant level of high yield passenger booking requests.
