40|$|Ever since public {{authorities}} stopped recruiting staff, {{the movement has}} swelled: all over the developing world, more and more young unemployed graduates are thinking of working on the land, full or part-time. At least they will get fed, {{be able to see}} their way through {{to the end of the}} month, make their retirement safe and, sometimes, give the village a bit of a boost. Many of them are, it is true, reluctant farmers but some have gone out and got specialised training to make their elders land prosper; others are using their various graduate disciplines to diversify production. All in all, they are changing the face of farming, and turning it into a real profession. Not always with success, mind you. Agriculture is not always easy on experts. We examine some portraits of the prodigal or novice <b>graduate</b> <b>farmer.</b> In the beginning, there was the father. The father pastor of the Presbyterian church of Cameroon. In 1953 he took out the land rights on the family estate at Mbenguè Souk, a village 160 kilometres from the capital. It had rich, fertile soil. The railway line was a stone s throw away, and the station just two-and-a-half kilometres; quite an asset for shipping away the cocoa production of the Reverend Father Sendè, a farmer by trade. Father Sendè encouraged his sons to stay close to the land, despite their various university journeys. Pierre became a gynaecologist. Jean-Victor, a graduate in urban planning and an architect by training, had studied in France. His wife Georgette was a barrister in Cameroon. Yet in 1963, they picked up the baton from father Sendè, and grew cocoa and cassava. In 1977 the farm really started to develop. It was when the youngest son, David, came back home: rather than become a civil servant, the young agriculturalist, who had trained in France, settled down in the village and set about replacing his father s cocoa with oil palms. His brothers pooled their savings and bought four chain-saws and two tractors, second-hand. Jean-Emile, a nephew and mechanical engineer, built two oil presses. The initial investment was CFA 28, 600, 000 (about E 43, 664), and they had to find a way to cover their start-up costs and the quarterly cleaning of the machines. Gradually, by buying up neighbouring plots, the Sendè estate grew to cover 70 hectares of palm, five of orchards, another five for pineapples, together with two ponds producing fish for family consumption or distribution to villagers. The Sendè s also had other crops such as bananas, cucumbers, new cocoyams, taro and maize. Nowadays their pineapple juice is on sale in supermarkets throughout Cameroon. Most of their oil palm production has been leased to the parastatal Socapalm company, which processes it into palm oil. The success of the family has had a strong ripple effect on the community. Seasonal workers are employed for heavy work. Six full time agricultural workers work alongside David. The Sendè s really have contributed to the uplifting of the farming world of Mbenguè-Souk, notably through sharing ideas and resources through Common Interest Groups (known as GICs) which they started up. The Common Interest Group of Souk tree-keepers (known as GICARSOUK), for example, brings together all orchard owners in the village. It will soon be time for the farm to be handed on again. The Reverend s grandson is thirty now, so this story will go on and on The engineer and the plants Stephan Tongo was trained as an engineer in the national training college at Vierzon in France. In the early 1960 s, he took up a post in the national railway company of Cameroon, as the manager of rolling-stock maintenance. At home, in the villa garden, he started raising chickens, setting out a chicken run with fences among his mango and guava trees. He made his own incubators, feeding troughs and watering troughs. It all started as a hobby, but gradually it became a means of seeing his way to the end of the month and feeding his family. His talent as an engineer provided a good foundation for setting up a real farm. With help from his sons and his mother, by 1982 he had a battery farm of 1, 000 laying hens, and 500 meat chickens, and a growing clientele. Then one sad day a supplier gives him some bad feed, and it killed his chickens. At the same time, he was promoted to a job that took all his time, leaving him with none for looking after his poultry. So Stephan Tongo sold out, sold everything. A few years later, after retiring from the railway company, he started playing around, out of interest, with medicinal plants. He visited old healers and he joined in a research project to make the National Herbarium of Cameroon. Learning to treat stomach upsets and other illnesses, he launched a research centre called 'Besoka ba Miele', which means 'the secret of plants' in the Duala language. He carried on healing, started to grow medicinal plants, and continued to innovate: he invented a process for pasteurising his potions, and discovered that some of the plants can be administered to the sick in the form of infusions which he now makes himself. The greenhouse that he built on the corner of his house serves as a pharmacy where he directly picks the plants he uses to treat his patients. He has become involved in surveying the major herbs and barks which treat malaria and asthma. His ambition is as strong as ever: now he wants to expand his plant crops and have a huge reserve of medicinal plants, producing them on a large scale. From spectacles to tobacco and back again Serge Andriantsitohaina has always had a calling for the soil. He was born into a family of tobacco planters, and as a child he would dream of raising chickens and keeping a plantation of maize to feed them. He graduated as an optician in France, but back in Madagascar he saw the opportunities laid before him by an extension campaign on growing geraniums, and he grabbed them. He decided to run the family estate located an hour-and-a-half from the capital. He hired consultants, cleared the land, set up with a biochemist for distilling the flours, and engaged twenty families to look after the land, and to grow food crops (rice). At harvest he employed 80 workers. Having become well-known, he found himself elected as mayor of the commune, and started to see a path of considerable profits roll out before him. And then, suddenly, three years of investment and hard work were wiped out by a disease which killed off his geraniums. Three months ago, in mid- 1999, Serge turned back to the old loves of his family, and re-invested in tobacco. Not for him any export, since he sells his produce to the state monopoly Ofmata (Malagasy Tobacco Authority), nor any technical risks: Oftmata extension agents provide seeds, fertiliser and technical training. The support provided by Oftama, Serge recounts, is more and more pathetic. But, look on the bright side, the land is being worked, the rice crop is still there, and the small farmers have keep their work. As for himself, Serge is going to take up his optician s business again. His wife will stay in the country. And he won t be standing at the next communal elections. Many geraniums dead, one computer scientist down He started his career as a computer scientist at IBM in Montpellier, France. When David Rajaonson returned home to Madagascar, an unexpected niche opened up for him, in the form of low production of geraniums in neighbouring Réunion. How about growing geraniums? OK, why not? He could get his hands on 50 hectares of agricultural land outside the capital Antananarivo. He teaches himself agriculture, and off he goes. For 13 years his company, with its 60 agricultural workers, plants, gathers, distils and, in the end, exports essential oils from geraniums and other aromatic plants. And then one sad day an uncontrollable disease decimates his entire plantation. 'Being a farmer is the most difficult profession of all, David nods. A farmer has to deal with natural disasters, insects, shortages of fertiliser, not to mention the motivational problems of your personnel The international agencies will send no end of experts to study the problem but they contribute nothing new. All you see is a dribble of funding which doesn t get the results you expect. You know, the Malagasy farmer knows how to plant, and he knows his land. All he needs is the means. If you added up all the money spent over the decades on international expertise, you would have enough to pay for improved seed varieties, fertilisers, tractors, dams. ' David in the meantime is looking to return full-time to his profession as a computer scientist.

The study aims to compare changes in the technical efficiency of those FFS graduate and non-FFS <b>graduate</b> maize producing <b>farmers</b> in Ethiopia, Oromia. For this, panel data were collected in two rounds from 446 randomly selected households from three districts consisting of 218 FFS <b>graduate</b> <b>farmers</b> and 228 non-FFS <b>graduate</b> <b>farmers.</b> The analytical procedure has involved three stages: in the first stage, descriptive analyses were used to detect existence of the difference in the outcome indicators between the two farmer groups. In the second stage, we have applied a semi-parametric impact evaluation method of propensity score matching with several matching algorithms to estimate the program impact. In the third stage, we used Difference-in-Difference as robustness check in detecting causality between program intervention and the technical efficiency. The combined uses of these alternative estimation techniques indicate that the program has a negative impact on the technical efficiency of the FFS graduates. Numerous plausible explanations for this outcome are discussed, and recommendations for improvements are suggested accordingly...|$|R

The specific objectives were to: describe the socio-economic characteristics of the respondents, identify major cocoa farmers’ perceived benefit items; determine the level of benefit; compare cocoa FFS farmers performance in terms of benefits/costs with non-FFS cocoa farmers. A multi-stage sampling procedure was used in composing 77 FFS <b>graduate</b> <b>farmers</b> and 76 non-FFS farmers for the study. Data were analysed using various descriptive statistics (frequency counts, percentages, means and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (t-test). The findings of the study indicated that the FFS farmers benefited in terms if improved income, increased yield, reduction of farm costs and other aspects. The t-tests result comparing the FFS Farmers with non-FFS farmers on some benefits/cost items showed that the FFS farmers were better off. It was therefore concluded that FFS training was beneficial to the cocoa farmers and recommended that FFS be extended to other categories of farmers to promote its beneficial effects...|$|R

A multistage sampling procedure was used to collect data from 68 respondents. A well structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Simple descriptive statistics (frequency counts and percentages) and logit regression were used to analyze the data. The results of the study showed that there was no significant sharing of knowledge by the FFS farmers with other farmers as only 13 (19. 1 %) FFS farmers were involved in knowledge sharing. The logit regression result showed that all the socio-economic variables except household size and farm size were insignificant in influencing the FFS farmers’ knowledge sharing abilities. From the findings of the study, it was therefore recommended that FFS <b>graduate</b> <b>farmers</b> should be encouraged to sign knowledge sharing contract, to organize field day and the need for FFS facilitators to monitor the graduates to ensure that the contractual agreement is adhered to should be stressed. </p...|$|R

40|$|The Forest Geospatial Information & Survey Lab in {{cooperation}} with Aeroscan Precision (M) Sdn Bhd at Lebuh Silikon, Universiti Putra Malaysia, spent {{the last four years}} developing airborne hyperspectral remote sensing and GIS applications, many of which address agriculture, forestry and the environment. This paper wants to make clear from the outset. Despite the lack of significant commercial success for businesses trying to sell airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data and services to agriculture, the only currently available imaging technology being pioneered and developed in UPM, does work. There is no doubt of its benefits to the agriculture industry especially the oil palm plantation giants in saving money, time, increasing yield, enhancing best practices, protecting the environment, and more. Despite that, the company just not made a “real” business of it perhaps due to the market for airborne hyperspectral remote sensing products and services related to agriculture, is still not known to most state and federal departments and agencies on the other. The consumer, for now, is not really in the picture. The commercial side can be broken down into the growers, who produce the food, Farmers Coops that may include growers but also produce food products and food providers. While some states have huge agricultural bases, few have money to invest in airborne hyperspectral remote sensing, which leaves quite a lot of burden on the federal government. The UPM-Aeroscan Precision (M) Sdn Bhd experience launched in 2004, planned to serve the commercial agricultural market by bringing the benefits of airborne hyperspectral remote sensing, also provide a real-time “GIS-ready” made database, and timely crop yield information to the plantation sector and farmer. The vision was simple: the farmer would build his own real-time airborne remote sensing GIS-ready made database documenting fertilizer, watering and planting details in the software (something typically done in a notebook by future high-tech Malaysian <b>graduated</b> <b>farmers)</b> {{with the use of a}} crop model to predict the expected yield. The check was to compare that expected outcome to the reality of the airborne hyperspectral remotely sensing images. For that level of detail, the UPM-APSB’s AISA very high resolution airborne hyperspectral imagery (1 m), and in near real-time could only provide the solution for the Malaysian modern generation farmers in the hope that computer technology will reach them. In this paper, what UPM-APSB’s AISA airborne hyperspectral remote sensing can bring to agriculture is demonstrated. First off, it can be used to monitor yields, early in the season, and then later. Second, airborne hyperspectral remote sensing can delineate soil zones. A third area of benefit is in field delineation where the boundaries of crops, in support of regulatory procedures could be easily found. The final area is precision agriculture, about best practices, giving a crop just the water, fertilizer, herbicide, etc. it needs to grow to its potential, but no more. The authors feel strongly that precision agriculture could have a significant impact on the Malaysian future environment. If the UPM-APSB’s AISA near real-time data can map and provide just enough nitrogen, the impact on the environment is reduced and the plants should still provide their maximum yield. Applying this just enough vision should save the farmer’s money on herbicide, water, fertilizer and other such costs. </p...|$|R

40|$|Describes {{experience}} of: CIMMYT with Storytelling, Participatory varietal selectionContext: Up to 65 % of {{arable land}} in Africa {{is dedicated to}} maize production. It is a major commodity and source of food yet the constraint is drought, disease and weeds. The project {{is trying to make}} 100 varieties of maize in Africa that we are trying to make drought tolerant. Gender has become an important issue for helping the least privileged groups. Other differentiations such as level of education and wealth are important as well. Interface: Farmers are engaged through long-term participatory varietal selection. Learning: Learning occurs between researchers and farmers, including women, about appropriate varieties in the first 1 or 2 seasons. Once varieties are identified, you ask farmers to experiment with 1 ? 2 dozen to compare to the varieties they are used to (that is, commercial, local). They plant and manage (timely planting, right stand, population, fertilizer/input application). They are then asked at different stages, what variety they would choose and why. For instance, benefits relate to resistance to drought, aesthetics, germination. Channels: Stories about learning and knowledge are used to expand that knowledge to farmers/beneficiaries, by demonstrating learning and impact/results. Local media is used, both print media and radio. 80 % of farmers are exposed to the radio, a useful communication. Bulletins are used to target farmers. Journalists are invited to national meetings to get exposure to the issues (that is, Farm Radio). Capacity building is occurring at different levels. Trainers of trainers deal with local situations via direct training and on-farm trial/research. National programs help train <b>graduate</b> students. <b>Farmers</b> are getting exposed to what we are doing – use of new technologies and varieties, and practices.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to {{the debate on the}} way forward in sub-­‐Saharan Africa with respect to the agrarian question in emerging markets under economic liberalisation.
