500|$|From 1954, {{the horse}} was also brought out for a Whitsun celebration {{in which it was}} paraded from Charing to the village green at Wye. A special service was held in the Charing Church, in which the Morris Men danced in the chancel and through the aisle, while the vicar bridled the horse itself. The horse was also brought out for a July 1956 {{ceremony}} in which The Swan Inn, a pub at Wickhambreaux, was officially renamed as The Hooden Horse; present were the East Kent Morris Men, the Handbell Ringers, and the Ravensbourne Morris Men. This venture led to the groups establishing a new folk custom, [...] "hop hoodening", which was derived in part from an older <b>hop</b> <b>picking</b> ceremony found in the Weald area. Their new custom involved the different groups joining together on a tour around the villages of East Kent, beginning at Canterbury Cathedral and going through Ramsgate, Cliftonville, and Herne Bay before ending in a barn dance at Wickhambreaux.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the days}} of {{mechanised}} farming, <b>hop</b> <b>picking</b> was a labour-intensive process, requiring a vastly greater number of people than were available locally. Whole families (including children {{who could have been}} at school) from London, particularly the south-east and east of London, would leave their homes and spend their time working in the Wealden hop-fields of Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Hampshire. By the 1870s, the South Eastern Railway and the London Chatham and Dover Railway were running Hop Pickers' Specials to transport Londoners to the towns and villages {{at the start of the}} season. Similar trains were run to serve the pickers in Herefordshire and Worcestershire. An estimated 250,000 hop pickers from London were travelling to Kent by the early twentieth century [...] In Hampshire, some workers came from the Portsmouth, Southampton and Salisbury areas. Hopper huts were also provided in Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Workers in these two counties would come from the Black Country or South Wales. The miners from South Wales remained at home and carried on working at their pits. Accommodation in the early Victorian period would be in barns, stables, cattle sheds, pigsties, tents or the roof space of buildings. This led to problems with hygiene and therefore health. An outbreak of cholera killed 43 hop-pickers at East Farleigh in September 1849.|$|E
2500|$|Wages {{were to be}} paid {{based on}} the weight of <b>hops</b> <b>picked,</b> with pickers promised a pay rate of $1 per 100 pounds harvested. This rate was {{deceptive}} in that the <b>picked</b> <b>hops</b> were heavily cleaned before final weighing, with no pickers allowed to be present to verify {{the work of the}} cleaning crew. Workers generally received less than $1.50 per day for twelve hours of toil under a summer sun that could reach [...] Workers on other farms in the area typically netted twice as much.|$|R

The first inhabitants were poor and of Romany background. Many of them retained their caravans and they formed their own tight-knit community, one that continues to this day. These gypsy families would spend the winter in houses, with their caravans in the garden, and travel away in summer <b>hop</b> <b>picking</b> or fruit picking. The men would also race their horses on the local roads during their regular horse sales, to the great pleasure of the villagers and extreme frustration of the local police, who rarely managed to outwit the frantic riders.|$|E

Fanny's best friend, Minnie Warner, was the same age and lived at 143 Tanhouse Lane. The town of Alton was renowned for its plentiful supply of hops, which led to many breweries opening in the town and made <b>hop</b> <b>picking</b> {{an integral part of}} its economy until the late 20th century. To the northern end of Tanhouse Lane lies Flood Meadows and surrounding the River Wey, which sometimes flooded the area in times of heavy rain. A large hop garden was located next to the meadows.|$|E

50|$|The {{need for}} massed labor at harvest time meant hop-growing {{had a big}} social impact. Around the world, the labor-intensive {{harvesting}} work involved large numbers of migrant workers who would travel for the annual hop harvest.

Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage and {{a large part of}} George Orwell's A Clergyman's Daughter contain a vivid description of London families participating in this annual hops harvest. In England, many of those <b>picking</b> <b>hops</b> in Kent were from eastern areas of London. This provided a break from urban conditions that was spent in the countryside. People also came from Birmingham and other Midlands cities to <b>pick</b> <b>hops</b> in the Malvern area of Worcestershire. Some photographs have been preserved.|$|R

These programmes were the BBC's technically most complicated assignment, linking the Commonwealth outposts with Broadcasting House in London via elaborate world-wide link-ups. Another notable example of Gilliam's early technical ambition was 'Opping 'Oliday—a ‘sound picture’ of <b>hop</b> <b>picking</b> in Kent—which he produced in 1934 using the newly established mobile recording van. Val Gielgud, head of drama, transferred responsibility for features to Gilliam in May 1936, though features really came into their own during the Second World War.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike other economies {{which were}} family-oriented and gender-mixed, such as fishing and <b>hop</b> <b>picking,</b> or {{predominantly}} female, such as salmon canning and small-scale agriculture, forestry work was exclusively performed by men.

Mill work and longshoring, by contrast, were often more continuous forms of employment. However, due to the shortage of labour which lasted until the 1900s, Native workers were in the advantageous position of being able to work intermittently as best suited to their own independent economic interests.

5000|$|Bredhurst School {{was built}} in 1867 during the later part of the victorian era. In the log book of Bredhurst school the rural dean was {{reported}} to say [...] "I am glad to find that a very good school has been built which is of great advantage to the Parish and of material benefit to the rising generation.” The school was typically Victorian with high windows in the schoolroom to avoid distractions to pupils, a central stove to provide heating and the Schoolmistress' accommodation adjoining. The earliest log book shows that Mrs S.Belcher was Headmistress and was supported by two assistant mistresses and the Vicar {{who lived in the}} Rectory, an imposing edifice which stood where Fir Tree Grove is now situated. The curriculum differed greatly from today's and included drill for the boys, knitting and needlework for the girls, recitations and object lessons on subjects as diverse “The Tongue of a Bee” and “Dairying and Cattle Feeding.” These object lessons were sometimes given by the Managers of the School or the Vicar and were illustrated by lantern slides. Bredhurst has always been a Church school and as such the regular three-hour Scripture lessons were very important. The Vicar attends very frequently to teach the children Bible stories, Catechisms and Psalms. Many of the issues faced by the Victorian school remain the same today; financial restraints, heating, maintenance, behavioural problems, visits from the School (nit) Nurse, dentist etc., etc. In those days, however, there were more holidays in which to recover the equilibrium. There were holidays to accommodate <b>hop</b> <b>picking,</b> fruit picking, harvesting, Ascension Day, Whitsun, Empire Day, Independence Day, school treats/picnics, Sunday school outings, choir outings, Bank holidays, all ‘Royal' events and even ‘whim' holidays granted at the Managers discretion!
