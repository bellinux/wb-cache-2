The aircraft briefly appeared again on radar screens from 22:25:50 AT (01:25:50 UTC) to 22:26:04 AT (01:26:04 UTC). The last altitude recorded was 9,700 feet. According to the cockpit voice recorder, shortly after the first emergency declaration, the captain left his seat to fight the fire that was spreading {{to the rear of}} the cockpit; the Swissair volume of checklists was later found fused together in the wreckage, indicating that the captain may have attempted to use them to fan back the flames. The captain did not return to his seat; whether he was killed by the fire, asphyxiated by the smoke, or killed in the crash is not known. Flight <b>data</b> <b>recording</b> shows that engine two was shut down due to an engine fire approximately one minute before impact, implying that the first officer was still alive and continued trying to fly the aircraft until the final moments of the flight. At 22:31:18 AT (01:31:18 UTC), the aircraft struck the ocean at an estimated speed of 345mph (555km/h, 154m/s, or 299 knots) and with a force of the order of 350g, causing the aircraft to disintegrate instantly. The crash location was approximately , +/-300meters.|$|E
5|$|The {{instrumentation}} included ten smoked paper analog seismometers {{that were}} configured {{to allow for}} 48 hours of continuous single-component <b>data</b> <b>recording.</b> Six digital recorders built by the Institut de Physique du Globe de Strasbourg were also used to record signals from three-component seismometers. Eight of the selected sites were equipped with a vertical component velocity transducer along with an FM telemetry link to transfer data back to a central station where a three-component unit was stationed. There the seismic signals were digitized, along with an internal time signal and an external DCF77 time signal, and stored on magnetic tape. The tapes were then played back and the P-wave and S-wave arrival times were used to automatically determine aftershock locations. Approximately two hundred aftershocks were recorded each day for the first several days of the expedition {{and at the end}} of the recording period in February the equipment was still picking up around 100 shocks per day. The team then set out to determine an accurate velocity model using data from the more accurate telemetry network. The soviet geophysicists detonated 100 kilograms of TNT in a hole drilled near the mainshock epicenter and the resulting shock waves were detected and used to help pinpoint a more accurate crustal velocity value of 5.3 to 5.4km/s.|$|E

40|$|A Web {{database}} typically {{responds to}} a query with a Web page, which encodes the query results into semi-structured data objects using HTML tags. We call such data objects Web <b>data</b> <b>records</b> or <b>data</b> <b>records.</b> Mining Web <b>data</b> <b>records</b> {{is very important}} for many applications, e. g., meta search, comparative shopping, etc. This paper proposes a new effective approach called AutoRM, which mines <b>data</b> <b>records</b> from single Web page automatically. AutoRM involves three major steps: (1) constructing the DOM tree of the given Web page; (2) mining all sets of adjacent similar C-Records (Candidate <b>data</b> <b>Records)</b> from the constructed DOM tree; (3) mining actual <b>data</b> <b>records</b> from C-Records. In many Web pages, similar <b>data</b> <b>records</b> are distributed in bigger and adjacent similar objects. Existing approaches typically identify such objects as <b>data</b> <b>records.</b> Conversely, AutoRM views such objects as C-Records, and mines actual <b>data</b> <b>records</b> from them. One key issue for mining similar <b>data</b> <b>records</b> is the boundary detection of each <b>data</b> <b>record.</b> Existing approaches typically make some brittle assumptions for handling this issue. By making more robust assumptions, AutoRM tends to detect <b>data</b> <b>record</b> boundaries more accurately. Experimental results show that AutoRM is highly effective, and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches...|$|R

25|$|HDD data {{transfer}} rate depends upon the rotational speed of the platters and the <b>data</b> <b>recording</b> density. Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, advancing density becomes the main method to improve sequential transfer rates. Higher speeds require a more powerful spindle motor, which creates more heat. While areal density advances by increasing both the number of tracks across the disk {{and the number of}} sectors per track, only the latter increases the {{data transfer}} rate for a given rpm. Since {{data transfer rate}} performance tracks only one of the two components of areal density, its performance improves at a lower rate.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the lander}} was 355 m above the ground, airbags were {{inflated}} {{in less than}} a second using three catalytically cooled solid rocket motors that served as gas generators. The airbags were made of 4 inter-connected multi-layer vectran bags that surrounded the tetrahedron lander. They were designed and tested to accommodate grazing angle impacts as high as 28m/s. However, as the airbags were designed for no more than about 15m/s vertical impacts, three solid retrorockets were mounted above the lander in the backshell. These were fired at 98m above the ground. The lander's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0m/s between 15 and 25m above the ground. After 2.3 seconds, while the rockets were still firing, the lander cut the bridle loose about 21.5m above the ground and fell to the ground. The rockets flew up and away with the backshell and parachute (they have since been sighted by orbital images). The lander impacted at 14m/s and limited the impact to only 18G of deceleration. The first bounce was 15.7m high and continued bouncing for at least 15 additional bounces (accelerometer <b>data</b> <b>recording</b> did not continue through all of the bounces).|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of radiocarbon dating {{has had a}} profound impact on archaeologyoften described as the [...] "radiocarbon revolution". [...] In the words of anthropologist R.E. Taylor, [...] " [...] data made a world prehistory possible by contributing a time scale that transcends local, regional and continental boundaries". It provides more accurate dating within sites than previous methods, which usually derived either from stratigraphy or from typologies (e.g. of stone tools or pottery); it also allows comparison and synchronization of events across great distances. The advent of radiocarbon dating may even have led to better field methods in archaeology, since better <b>data</b> <b>recording</b> leads to firmer association of objects with the samples to be tested. These improved field methods were sometimes motivated by attempts to prove that a [...] date was incorrect. Taylor also suggests that the availability of definite date information freed archaeologists from the need to focus so much of their energy on determining the dates of their finds, and led to an expansion of the questions archaeologists were willing to research. For example, from the 1970s questions about the evolution of human behaviour were much more frequently seen in archaeology.|$|E

It passed the south solar pole in June 1994 {{and crossed the}} ecliptic equator in February 1995. The solar X-ray and cosmic gamma-ray burst experiment (GRB) had 3 main objectives: study and monitor solar flares, detect and localize cosmic gamma-ray bursts, and in-situ detection of Jovian aurorae. Ulysses was the first satellite carrying a gamma burst detector which went outside the orbit of Mars. The hard X-ray detectors operated in the range 15–150 keV. The detectors consisted of 23-mm thick × 51-mm diameter CsI(Tl) crystals mounted via plastic light tubes to photomultipliers. The hard detector changed its operating mode depending on (1) measured count rate, (2) ground command, or (3) change in spacecraft telemetry mode. The trigger level was generally set for 8-sigma above background and the sensitivity is 10−6 erg/cm2 (1 nJ/m2). When a burst trigger is recorded, the instrument switches to record high resolution <b>data,</b> <b>recording</b> it to a 32-kbit memory for a slow telemetry read out. Burst data consist of either 16 s of 8-ms resolution count rates or 64 s of 32-ms count rates from {{the sum of the}} 2 detectors. There were also 16 channel energy spectra from the sum of the 2 detectors (taken either in 1, 2, 4, 16, or 32 second integrations).
