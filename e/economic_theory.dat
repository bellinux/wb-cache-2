5|$|Even in finite dimensions, the {{concepts}} of functional analysis have illuminated <b>economic</b> <b>theory,</b> particularly in clarifying the role of prices as normal vectors to a hyperplane supporting a convex set, representing production or consumption possibilities.

5|$|John von Neumann's work on {{functional}} analysis and topology in broke new ground {{in mathematics and}} <b>economic</b> <b>theory.</b> It also left advanced mathematical economics with fewer applications of differential calculus.

5|$|The {{balanced}} growth theory is an <b>economic</b> <b>theory</b> pioneered by the economist Ragnar Nurkse (1907–1959).

5|$|According to the <b>economic</b> <b>theory</b> behind {{congestion}} pricing, {{the objective}} of this policy is the use of the price mechanism to make users more aware of the costs that they impose upon one another when consuming during the peak demand, and that they should pay for the additional congestion they create, thus encouraging the redistribution of the demand in space or in time, or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good; for example, switching from private transport to public transport.|$|E

5|$|Beginning with William Stanley Jevons and Clément Juglar in the 1860s, economists {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} cycles of frequent, violent shifts in economic activity. A key milestone in this endeavor was {{the foundation of the}} U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research by Wesley Mitchell in 1920. This marked the beginning of a boom in atheoretical, statistical models of economic fluctuation (models based on cycles and trends instead of <b>economic</b> <b>theory)</b> that led to the discovery of apparently regular economic patterns like the Kuznets wave.|$|E

5|$|New classicals {{broke with}} Keynesian <b>economic</b> <b>theory</b> {{completely}} while monetarists had built on Keynesian ideas. Despite discarding Keynesian theory, new classical economists did share the Keynesian focus on explaining short-run fluctuations. New classicals replaced monetarists {{as the primary}} opponents to Keynesianism and changed the primary debate in macroeconomics from whether to look at short-run fluctuations to whether macroeconomic models should be grounded in microeconomic theories. Like monetarism, new classical economics was rooted at the University of Chicago, principally with Robert Lucas. Other leaders {{in the development of}} new classical economics include Edward Prescott at University of Minnesota and Robert Barro at University of Rochester.|$|E

5|$|Spatial {{economics}} {{deal with}} distance and area, {{and how these}} may affect a market through transportation costs and geographical limitations. The development of spatial economics is usually ascribed to German economist Johann Heinrich von Thünen; however, Cantillon addressed spatial economics nearly a century earlier. Cantillon integrated his advancements in spatial <b>economic</b> <b>theory</b> into his microeconomic analysis of the market, describing how transportation costs influence the location of factories, markets and population centres—that is, individuals strive to lower transportation costs. Conclusions on spatial economics were derived from three premises: cost of raw materials of equal quality will always be higher near the capital city, due to transportation costs; transportation costs vary on transportation type (for example, water transportation was considered cheaper than land-based transportation); and larger goods that {{are more difficult to}} transport will always be cheaper closer to their area of production. For example, Cantillon believed markets were designed as they were to decrease costs to both merchants and villagers in terms of time and transportation. Similarly, Cantillon posited that the locations of cities were the result in large part of the wealth of inhabiting property owners and their ability to afford transportation costs—wealthier property owners tended to live farther from their property, because they could afford the transportation costs. In Essai, spatial <b>economic</b> <b>theory</b> was used to derive why markets occupied the geographical area they did and why costs varied across different markets.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann's {{results have}} been viewed as a special case of linear programming, where von Neumann's model uses only nonnegative matrices. The study of von Neumann's model of an {{expanding}} economy continues to interest mathematical economists with interests in computational economics. This paper {{has been called the}} greatest paper in mathematical economics by several authors, who recognized its introduction of fixed-point theorems, linear inequalities, complementary slackness, and saddlepoint duality. In the proceedings of a conference on von Neumann's growth model, Paul Samuelson said that many mathematicians had developed methods useful to economists, but that von Neumann was unique in having made significant contributions to <b>economic</b> <b>theory</b> itself.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{sustainability}} {{has emerged}} as a focal area of cross-disciplinary inquiry and has tended to be problem-driven. These developments are supported by a number of <b>economic</b> <b>theories</b> that include the Neo- Malthusian theory, Kuznet’s Hypothesis and Hardin’s Tragedy of the Commons. Two frameworks: theoretical and conceptual were created by assessing correlations based on the above mentioned <b>economic</b> <b>theories.</b> Study frameworks were designed and validated as “economy tools’ for quantitative analysis of variables that are deemed important for sustainable management. These frameworks were applied to the palm oil industry and its sustainability challenges. Stakeholders’ perceptions and their management were incorporated in the overall palm oil economic analysis for sustainability management. This paper discusses the various existing <b>economic</b> <b>theories</b> and how each of it relates to sustainability, and the development of sustainable palm oil industry. Two frameworks were designed: the theoretical framework capturing the analysis of the existing <b>economic</b> <b>theories</b> and their relevance to sustainability and the palm oil industry. In the second framework, a conceptual design was developed as a tool depicting linkages to all important parameters that required evaluation, when measuring sustainability. Overall, despite these framework developments and their application, we conclude that sustainability and existing <b>economic</b> <b>theories</b> do not completely resolve the issue of sustainable production with regards to land management or sustainable land development in the agricultural sector...|$|R

5|$|Cantillon {{is one of}} the few economists {{cited by}} Adam Smith, who {{directly}} borrows Cantillon's sustenance theory of wages. Large sections of Smith's <b>economic</b> <b>theory</b> were possibly directly influenced by Cantillon, although in many respects Adam Smith advanced well beyond the scope of Cantillon. Some economic historians have argued that Adam Smith provided little of value from his own intellect, notably Schumpeter and Rothbard. In any case, through his influence on Adam Smith and the physiocrats, Cantillon was quite possibly the pre-classical economist who contributed most to the ideas of the classical school. Illustrative of this was Cantillon's influence on Say, which is noticeable in the methodology employed in the latter's Treatise on Political Economy.|$|E
