40|$|The applied {{model of}} mental imagery use {{proposed}} an interaction effect between <b>imagery</b> type <b>and</b> <b>imagery</b> ability (Martin et al., 1999). This study had two aims, (i) {{the examination of}} imagery ability as a moderating variable between <b>imagery</b> type <b>and</b> dispositional flow, and (ii) the testing of alternative mediation models. The sample consisted of 367 athletes from Scotland and Australia, who completed the Sport Imagery Questionnaire, Sport <b>Imagery</b> Ability Questionnaire, <b>and</b> Dispositional Flow Scale- 2. Hierarchical regression analysis showed direct effects of <b>imagery</b> use <b>and</b> <b>imagery</b> ability on flow, but no significant interaction. Mediation analysis revealed a significant indirect path, indicating a partially mediated relationship (p =. 002) between imagery use, <b>imagery</b> ability, <b>and</b> flow. Partial mediation was confirmed when the effect of cognitive <b>imagery</b> use <b>and</b> cognitive <b>imagery</b> ability was tested, and a full mediation model was found between motivational imagery use, motivational <b>imagery</b> ability <b>and</b> flow. The results are discussed in conjunction with potential future research directions on advancing theory and applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of graffiti art in Malaysia {{can be traced}} back to the late 1990 ’s. Since then, graffiti art has been embraced by local municipalities as well as the National Visual Art Gallery (NVAG) in their public programming and activities. Despite these positive developments, how the local graffiti artists infused local <b>imageries</b> <b>and</b> identities in their work had not been examined. The parallels between graffiti art practices and the development of modern art in Malaysia, made the emergence of forms and themes that reflect local identity in graffiti art not a surprise, as these were also the inherent issues explored by local artists in the domain of fine arts. This paper, hence, discusses the different approaches taken by Malaysia’s graffiti artists, how they incorporate and explored their visual ideas rooted in hip hop culture and the New York City Subway graffiti, with local <b>imageries</b> <b>and</b> identities. This paper will also discuss the history and background of Malaysia’s graffiti art as well as how Malaysian graffiti artists employed various local <b>imageries</b> <b>and</b> identity...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{observational}} {{studies examining}} <b>imagery,</b> self-efficacy, <b>and</b> adherence during injury rehabilitation have been cross-sectional {{and thus have}} not provided a clear representation of what occurs {{over the course of}} the rehabilitation period. The objectives of this research were (1) to examine the temporal patterns of <b>imagery,</b> self-efficacy, <b>and</b> rehabilitation adherence during an 8 -week rehabilitation program and (2) to identify the time-order relationships between <b>imagery,</b> self-efficacy, <b>and</b> adherence. The design of the study was prospective and observational. 90 injured people (n= 57 males; n= 33 females) aged 18 - 78 years attending an injury rehabilitation clinic participated. The main outcome measures were <b>imagery</b> (cognitive, motivational, <b>and</b> healing), self-efficacy (task and coping), and rehabilitation adherence (duration, quality, and frequency). Results indicated that task efficacy, <b>imagery</b> use, <b>and</b> adherence levels remained stable, while coping efficacy declined over time. During the course of rehabilitation, moderate to strong reciprocal relationships existed between self-efficacy and adherence to rehabilitation. Weak to moderate relationships were found between <b>imagery</b> use <b>and</b> rehabilitation adherence. The results of this study can be used to inform the development of interventions steeped in self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>imagery</b> aimed at improving rehabilitation adherence and treatment outcome...|$|R

5|$|Yeats is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} twentieth century key English language poets.

His use of symbols is usually something physical that is both itself and a suggestion of other, perhaps immaterial, timeless qualities.|$|E
5|$|After being named, Gamede quickly intensified, and the JTWC {{classified}} it with {{winds of}} 120km/h (75mph) early on February 22. As it turned west-southwestward, an eye feature became evident on satellite <b>imagery,</b> <b>and</b> the JTWC upgraded Gamede to tropical cyclone status, or the equivalence of a minimal hurricane. Subsequently, its intensification rate slowed somewhat, due to restricted outflow. At 0000UTC on February 23 the MFR upgraded the storm to Tropical Cyclone Gamede, and shortly thereafter it passed over St. Brandon island. Subsequently, outflow became better established, and the JTWC unofficially estimated the cyclone attained winds of 185km/h (115mph) late on February 23 about 250km (400mi) north-northeast of Mauritius island. Initially it was forecast to strengthen further, though slight weakening occurred when a nearby upper-level trough restricted outflow.|$|E

5|$|After {{entering}} the Gulf of California, an eye began to become apparent on visible satellite <b>imagery,</b> <b>and</b> {{it is estimated}} Isis attained hurricane status late on September 2. Continuing northward, it struck Topolobampo {{in the state of}} Sinaloa early on September 3 as a minimal hurricane. Isis weakened to a tropical storm a few hours after landfall, and subsequent to turning to the north-northwest the low-level circulation dissipated over Sierra Madre Occidental. The remnants entered southern Arizona on September 4 and tracked around an upper-level low. After entering Nevada on September 5, the remnants of Isis passed into Oregon before dissipating in Idaho on September 8.|$|E
5|$|Although {{thunderstorm}} {{activity was}} initially minimal around {{the center of}} circulation, convective band associated with the depression was becoming more organized. Late on September10, convection began to increase slightly near the center, though because Dvorak intensity T-numbers were between 2.0 and 2.5, the depression was not upgraded to a tropical storm. However, dry air briefly caused showers and thunderstorms to decrease later that day. Initially, it headed just north of due west around the southern periphery of a large subtropical ridge. However, by September11, the depression re-curved northwestward. Later that day, the depression began to regain deep convection. Geostationary satellite <b>imagery</b> <b>and</b> scatterometer data indicated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine at 0000UTC on September12.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Lincoln was a {{religious}} skeptic, or, {{in the words}} of a biographer, an iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious <b>imagery</b> <b>and</b> language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However, he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.|$|E
