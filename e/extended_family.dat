5|$|The <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> {{consists}} of grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. In some circumstances, the <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> comes to live either with or {{in place of}} a member of the nuclear family. An example includes elderly parents who move in with their children due to old age. This places large demands on the caregivers, particularly the female relatives who choose to perform these duties for their <b>extended</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E
5|$|When parents die of HIV/AIDS, <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> members usually {{become the}} children's primary caregivers: in Malawi, 44% of double orphans are adopted by {{grandparents}} or other close relatives. <b>Extended</b> <b>family</b> members often provide crucial support to HIV/AIDS orphans; however, some sources indicate that <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> members mistreat orphans whose parents {{have died from}} HIV/AIDS. For example, family members {{who are unable to}} support adopted children often arrange early marriages for female orphans, who may then become victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse.|$|E
5|$|Family is {{the primary}} social and {{political}} grouping in Torajan society. Each village is one <b>extended</b> <b>family,</b> the seat {{of which is the}} tongkonan, a traditional Torajan house. Each tongkonan has a name, which becomes the name of the village. The familial dons maintain village unity. Marriage between distant cousins (fourth cousins and beyond) is a common practice that strengthens kinship. Toraja society prohibits marriage between close cousins (up to and including the third cousin)—except for nobles, to prevent the dispersal of property. Kinship is actively reciprocal, meaning that the <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> helps each other farm, share buffalo rituals, and pay off debts.|$|E

In addition, a paternal first cousin once-removed is the African-American Jewish Rabbi Capers Funnye, son of her grandfather's sister.|$|E
5|$|Clarinet choir, which {{features}} {{a large number of}} clarinets playing together, usually involves a range of different members of the clarinet family (see <b>Extended</b> <b>family</b> of clarinets).

5|$|Historically, among certain Asian and Native American {{cultures}} {{the family}} structure {{consisted of a}} grandmother and her children, especially daughters, who raised their own children together and shared child care responsibilities. Uncles, brothers, and other male relatives sometimes helped out. Romantic relationships {{between men and women}} were formed and dissolved with little impact on the children who remained in the mother's <b>extended</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E

Humber comes from a large <b>extended</b> <b>family.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the attribution to book three was simply incorrect, and Atalante's Ehoie came within the family of Athamas in books one or two. Another possibility is that she was introduced in the context of her mother's family. Her identity in the Catalogue is unknown, but this hypothesis could allow for Atalanta to appear within the Inachid stemma, following the Danae-Ehoie within the <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> of Belus.|$|E

30|$|The {{transfer}} to permanent housing created many problems, for example: {{the breakup of}} the <b>extended</b> <b>families</b> into nuclear families, exposing the couples, for the first time, to being distinct social units, accompanied by a loss of socio-economic and psychological recourses. One of the consequences was that wives were left alone to deal with their husbands' violence, losing the support previously provided by their <b>extended</b> <b>families</b> (Azezehu-Admasu, 2011;Tavaje, 2011).|$|R
5|$|Nauru {{does not}} have any formal {{structure}} for political parties, and candidates typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party, the Democratic Party, Nauru First, and the Centre Party. However, alliances within the government are often formed on the basis of <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> ties rather than party affiliation.|$|E

Bonds has a younger brother, Bobby, Jr., who was also a professional baseball player.

30|$|Families of 2 D arrays can be {{constructed}} where each array has perfect autocorrelation, and the cross-correlation between any pair of family members is optimally low. We exploit equivalent Hadamard matrices to construct many families of p p[*]×[*]p arrays, where p is any 4 k- 1 prime. From these <b>families,</b> we assemble <b>extended</b> <b>families</b> of arrays with members that exhibit perfect autocorrelation and next-to-optimally low cross-correlation. Pseudo-Hadamard matrices are used to construct <b>extended</b> <b>families</b> using p[*]=[*] 4 k[*]+[*] 1 primes. An optimal family of 31 31 [*]×[*] 31 perfect arrays can provide copyright protection to uniquely stamp a robust, low-visibility watermark within every frame of each second of high-definition, 30 [*]fps video. The <b>extended</b> <b>families</b> permit the embedding of many more perfect watermarks that have next-to-minimal cross-correlations.|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{compare the}} {{psychological}} adjustment of grandmothers from nuclear and <b>extended</b> <b>families</b> within British Hindu communities, and {{to investigate the}} influence of cultural identity. Design. Interviews were carried out with Hindu grandmothers, mothers and granddaughters living in both nuclear and <b>extended</b> <b>families.</b> Setting. The sample was drawn from {{the total population of}} Asian Hindu girls aged between 13 and 17 years at four comprehensive schools in the London Borough of Redbridge. Participants. The final sample consisted of 36 and 34 sets of individuals in <b>extended</b> and nuclear <b>families,</b> respectively. Measures. Questionnaire measures were obtained of the following variables: cultural integrity, traditionalism, religious participation, ethnic identity, anxiety, depression, self-esteem. Results. Grandmothers were better adjusted in <b>extended</b> <b>families</b> than in nuclear families. This adjustment was in part mediated by the level of traditional belief within the family. Elders whose granddaughters had an exclusively Indian or Hindu ethnic identity were better adjusted than those whose granddaughters included a British ethnic identity. Conclusions. This study confirmed findings from earlier studies that grandmothers in <b>extended</b> <b>families</b> were significantly better adjusted in comparison to those from nuclear families. Ethnic identity of the adolescent, independent of its salience and commitment to the adolescent, had a significant relationship to the grandmother's mental health...|$|R

5|$|The {{giant otter}} {{is a highly}} social animal and lives in <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> groups. Group sizes are {{anywhere}} from two to 20 members, but likely average between three and eight. (Larger figures may reflect two or three family groups temporarily feeding together.) The groups are strongly cohesive: the otters sleep, play, travel, and feed together.|$|E
5|$|These include {{same-sex}} relationships, single-parent households, adopting individuals, and <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> systems living together. The {{nuclear family}} is also choosing to have fewer children {{than in the}} past. The percentage of married-couple households with children under 18 has declined to 23.5% of all households in 2000 from 25.6% in 1990, and from 45% in 1960.|$|E

5|$|As the {{historic}} capital of Imerina, Antananarivo is centrally {{located in the}} homeland of the Merina people, who comprise about 24 {{percent of the population}} and are the largest Malagasy ethnic group. The city's history as the island's major center for politics, culture and trade has ensured a cosmopolitan mix of ethnic groups from across the island and overseas. Most Antananarivo residents have strong ties to their tanindrazana (ancestral village), where the <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> and typically a family tomb or burial place is located; many older residents leave the city upon retirement to return to their rural area of origin.|$|E
