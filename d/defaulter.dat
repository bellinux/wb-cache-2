25|$|Purandar Singha (181819, 18331838) was {{the last}} king of Ahom kingdom in Assam. He was {{installed}} as king twice. First time, he was installed by Ruchinath Burhagohain in 1818 CE, after the latter deposed Chandrakanta Singha from the throne. His first reign ended in 1819 CE, during the second Burmese invasion of Assam, when his forces were defeated and the Burmese reinstalled Chandrakanta Singha on the throne. He along with Ruchinath Burhagohain continued their efforts to expel Burmese invaders, by seeking help from British and through armed struggle. After First Anglo-Burmese War, the British East India Company occupied Assam from Bumese invaders. Finding it difficult to administer an unfamiliar region and sensing discontent among the local inhabitants to foreign rule, the British authorities decided to restore Upper Assam to one prince of Ahom Dynasty. Purander Singha was found suitable for this post and therefore, in April 1833 CE, except Sadiya and Matak region, the entire Upper Assam was formally made over to him, {{on the condition of}} yearly tribute of 50,000 rupees. Later, in 1838 CE, finding him incompetent and <b>defaulter</b> in payments of revenue, the British formally annexed his kingdom, putting an end to 600 years reign of Ahom Dynasty.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{identify}} factors reducing compliance at diagnosis, treatment, {{and review}} stages among women referred with abnormal cervical smears {{to a hospital}} colposcopy clinic. DESIGN [...] Retrospective analysis of sociodemographic data from hospital notes of the attenders and <b>defaulters</b> during one year (1989 - 90) and prospective collection of information by structured interviews of a sample of <b>defaulters</b> and attenders during five months (May-September 1990). SETTING [...] One hospital colposcopy clinic. PATIENTS [...] 238 women defaulting on two consecutive occasions and 188 attending regularly (retrospective analysis) and a subset of 40 <b>defaulters</b> and 24 attenders (interview sample). MAIN MEASURES [...] Sociodemographic data and interview responses about attitudes, behaviour, choice, accessibility cultural understanding, communications, and emotional response. RESULTS [...] 22 (12 %) women defaulted at diagnosis, 24 (13 %) at treatment, 39 (21 %) at the first check up after treatment, and 84 (45 %) at the review stage; 19 (10 %) defaulted from the first check up after diagnostic examination revealed no need for treatment. Age and social class differed between the two groups. 181 (76 %) <b>defaulters</b> were under 30 compared with 91 (48 %) attenders; 14 (6 %) compared with 41 (23 %) were over 40 (p < 0. 001). The proportion of women in social classes 4 and 5 was 33 %(20 / 60) for <b>defaulters</b> and 21 %(25 / 120) for attenders (p < 0. 05) and unemployed was 66 %(158 / 238) and 36 %(68 / 188) respectively. 63 (28 %) <b>defaulters</b> were pregnant compared with 11 (6 %) attenders (p < 0. 001). More <b>defaulters</b> came from gynaecology or antenatal clinics. Most <b>defaulters</b> (93 %) had child care responsibilities and they knew and understood less about colposcopy. Their explicit reasons for defaulting included child care commitments and fear and their implicit reasons lack of understanding, inaccessibility of information, and staff attitudes. CONCLUSIONS [...] Compliance may be improved by promoting women's understanding of treatment and encouraging health professionals to develop a service {{more sensitive to the}} various needs of women in different socioeconomic groups...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: Approximately, 40 % of the {{patients}} registered in the National AIDS Control Program in India are not on antiretroviral therapy (ART), i. e., are in pre-ART care. However, there are scarce data regarding the retention of pre-ART patients under routine program conditions. The main objective {{of this study was}} to find out the reasons for default among patients in pre-ART care. Materials and Methods: Patients enrolled in the ART Centre, Banaras Hindu University (BHU) between January and December 2009 and in pre-ART care were included in the study. <b>Defaulters</b> were those pre-ART patients who missed their last appointment of CD 4 count by more than 1 month. <b>Defaulters</b> were traced telephonically in 2011 and those who returned and gave their consent for the study were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Results: Out of 620 patients in pre-ART care, 384 (68. 2 %) were <b>defaulters.</b> One hundred forty-four of the <b>defaulters</b> were traced and only 83 reached the ART center for interview. Among <b>defaulters</b> who did not reach the ART center, illiterate and unmarried were significantly more and mean duration from registration to default was also significantly less as compared to those who came back for the interview. Most <b>defaulters</b> gave more than one reason for defaulting that were as follows: Inconvenient clinic timings (98 %), need for multiple mode of transport (92 %), perceived improved health (65 %), distance of center from home (61 %), lack of social support (62 %), and financial difficulty (59 %). Interpretation and Conclusion: Active tracing of pre-ART patients through outreach and strengthening of the Link ART centers will improve the retention of patients in the program...|$|R
5000|$|In 2017, the Finance Minister of Bangladesh, Mr Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, {{released}} {{the identities of}} the top 100 loan <b>defaulters</b> of Bangladesh. According to government records, Western Marine Shipyards was one of the top loan <b>defaulters</b> of the country. In essence, they were guilty of borrowing vast sums of money from mostly state banks without ever repaying the principal amount. This policy of defaulting on bank loans sharply lowered the stock price of Western Marine Shipyard in the Dhaka Stock Exchange over time, and subsequently forced the Managing Director of the company, Mr Sakhawat Hossain, to desperately seek loans for his struggling company. The public announcement of this loan defaulting corruption scandal severely damaged the reputation of Western Marine Shipyards, since loan <b>defaulters</b> have been singled out by the Government of Bangladesh for seriously jeopardizing the Bangladeshi economy by forcing state-owned banks to incur heavy losses. Loan <b>defaulters</b> have been described as thieves and con-artists by anti-corruption agencies, because they are essentialy people and businesses who borrow money from banks with no intention of repaying the debt.|$|R
