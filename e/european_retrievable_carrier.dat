40|$|On {{retrieval}} from Low Earth Orbit (LEG), {{the solar}} arrays from the <b>European</b> <b>Retrievable</b> Carrier(EuReCa) and one solar array {{wing of the}} Hubble Space Telescope (HST) were inspected for micrometeoroid and space debris impact damage. 703 and 814 impact sites respectively were analysed in detail. Interpretation of particle parameters from this large data set can yield a useful measurement of the micrometeoroid and debris flux in LEG. Due to similar orbital parameters, this then provides a flux measurement complimentary to those measured by the Timeband Capture Cell Experiment (TiCCE) of the EuReCa spacecraft and detectors and exposed surfaces on the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF). To allow comparison of data from the space retrieved solar cells to previous data, solar cell material, glass and aluminium targets were impacted for inter-calibration using the University of Kent's Light Gas Gun (LGG). An average of 20 impact sites on each target material per shot were measured. It was decided to consider only non-perforations of the 150 micron thick CMX cover glass, common to both EuReCa and HST solar cells. Trends in crater morphology of the laboratory impacts are discussed and compared to those from space impacts. The effects of impact angle and crater scaling with particle size are investigated and a conversion from appropriate solar cell crater parameters to the ballistic limit in aluminium is presented...|$|R

The carrier concept was derived from NASA's highly successful and flight proven Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF). The LDEF capabilities were enhanced to meet new customer requirements. This reusable payload carrier is planned for launch and retrieval by the space shuttle on a regular basis. The RPC's compact design facilitates flexible manifesting of the shuttle cargo bay space, thereby, permitting timely launches and retrievals. The vehicle is designed so that either the entire carrier can be retrieved from orbit, or individual experiment pallets can be removed and replaced in orbit. This gives customers even greater control over their experiment recoveries. A fully operational RPC System consists of: (1) a carrier spacecraft; (2) a ground control station for communication with customer payloads and the carrier; (3) a ground processing facility to provide refurbishment, final checkout, and integration of customer payloads and the carrier; and (4) the personnel required to support both the development and operation phases of the program. Customer payloads will fly 6 to 18 month missions, or longer, as required. Spreading launch, operations, and retrieval costs over multiple experimental payloads results in minimized customer costs. The RPC Program's initial objective is to operate a simple carrier system which meets basic customer service needs...|$|R

50|$|The mission's primary {{objectives}} were {{the deployment of}} the European Space Agency's EURECA (<b>European</b> <b>Retrievable</b> <b>Carrier)</b> and the joint NASA/Italian Space Agency Tethered Satellite System (TSS). EURECA was deployed a day later than scheduled because of a problem with its data handling system. Seven {{and a half hours}} after deployment, the spacecraft's thrusters were fired to boost EURECA to its planned operating altitude of around 310 miles. However, thruster firing was cut to six minutes from 24 minutes because of unexpected attitude data from the spacecraft. The problem was resolved, and EURECA was successfully boosted to its operational orbit on the mission's sixth day. TSS deployment also was delayed one day because of the problems with EURECA. During deployment, the satellite reached a maximum distance of only 860 feet from the orbiter instead of the planned 12.5 miles because of a jammed tether line. After numerous attempts over several days to free the tether, TSS operations were curtailed, and the satellite was stowed for return to Earth. It would be reflown in 1996 on STS-75.|$|E
