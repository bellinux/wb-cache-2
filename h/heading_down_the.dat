5|$|Because the Columbia was at {{the same}} {{latitude}} as {{the headwaters of the}} Missouri River, there was some speculation that Gray and Vancouver had discovered the long-sought Northwest Passage. A 1798 British map showed a dotted line connecting the Columbia with the Missouri. When the American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark charted the vast, unmapped lands of the American West in their overland expedition (1803–05), they found no passage between the rivers. After crossing the Rocky Mountains, Lewis and Clark built dugout canoes and paddled down the Snake River, reaching the Columbia near the present-day Tri-Cities, Washington. They explored a few miles upriver, as far as Bateman Island, before <b>heading</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Columbia, concluding their journey at the river's mouth and establishing Fort Clatsop, a short-lived establishment that was occupied for less than three months.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} {{then moved}} to the penultimate round at the Swedish Grand Prix with Spencer holding a two-point lead over Roberts. Roberts led Spencer going into the last lap of the race. <b>Heading</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> back straight, Spencer placed his Honda right behind Roberts' Yamaha {{as they reached the}} second to the last corner, a ninety degree right-hander. As both riders applied their brakes, Spencer came out of Roberts' slipstream and managed to get inside of the Yamaha. As they exited the corner, both riders ran wide off the track and into the dirt. Spencer was able {{to get back on the}} track and back on the power first, crossing the finish line just ahead of Roberts for a crucial victory. Roberts considered Spencer's pass to be foolish and dangerous, and exchanged angry words with him on the podium. Roberts would have to win the final round at the San Marino Grand Prix with Spencer finishing no better than third place in order for Roberts to win his fourth world championship. In a fitting end to a great career, Roberts won his last-ever Grand Prix race, however Spencer was able to secure second place to claim the world championship. The two riders dominated the season with each claiming six victories in the 12 race series.|$|E

25|$|In the 2010 FIFA World Cup quarter-final {{match against}} Ghana, {{the score was}} 1–1 {{at the end of}} {{regulation}} time and the game went into extra time. Late in extra time, Ghana sent a free kick into the box; Suárez blocked Stephen Appiah's shot on the goal line. He then blocked Dominic Adiyiah's goalbound header with his hands to prevent a last minute Ghana goal, committing a professional foul to save what would have been the game winner and was sent off. Ghana's Asamoah Gyan missed the resulting penalty spot kick and Suárez, who had stopped to watch, celebrated the miss before <b>heading</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> tunnel. Ghana subsequently lost the match 4–2 in the penalty shoot-out, and Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals.|$|E
25|$|The safety car was {{withdrawn}} after three laps and racing resumed with Asmer leading the field {{back up to}} speed. Jarvis remained close by as he was hoping to making his move on the following lap at Lisboa corner. As Van Der Zande crossed the start/finish line to continue racing, he attempted {{to find his way}} past Kennard. Van Der Zande was unable to get past and ended up drifting into the wall at Lisboa turn while Kennard resumed without trouble. Ho then made a pit stop and retired shortly after. On the fifth lap, Jarvis made his overtaking manoevure on Asmer for the lead by slipstreaming onto the back of him <b>heading</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> main straight and passed the driver around the outside at Lisboa corner. At the same time, Senna managed to find his way past Hülkenberg and started to close the gap to Buurmann. Hülkenberg then tried to line up a passing move on Senna to reclaim the position but lost control of his car and glanced the barriers lining the track at Lisboa corner. Both he and Senna were forced into retirement. Localised yellow flags were waved which neutralised racing in that section of the circuit because of debris scattered across the tarmac surface.|$|E

500|$|Captain Rogers led a {{scouting}} expedition from Fort Edward on January 15, {{stopping at}} Fort William Henry to acquire provisions, snowshoes, and additional soldiers. The company left Fort William Henry on January 17 with 86 men, <b>heading</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> frozen Lake George. The next day twelve men turned back because of injuries. The remaining men continued north, reaching Lake Champlain {{at a point}} between Fort Carillon and Fort St. Frédéric on January 21. They spotted a sled moving on the lake toward Fort St. Frédéric, so Rogers sent Lieutenant John Stark and some men to intercept it. [...] However, more sleds were spotted, and Stark's men were seen before they could retreat back into the woods. The sleds turned back toward Carillon. The British gave chase, {{but most of the}} French escaped. Rogers succeeded in taking seven prisoners.|$|E
500|$|Church Siding was {{immediately}} west of Wotton. It {{was treated as}} a station during the Tramway's early years and listed as such in timetables, but was never redeveloped following the conversion to locomotive haulage and its [...] "platform" [...] remained an earth bank with no buildings. Trains <b>heading</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Quainton Road–Brill line would pause {{at the entrance to the}} siding, and any wagons intended for the siding would be detached and hauled down the siding by rope. It ceased to be listed in timetables in September 1894, although there is some evidence that passenger trains ceased to make scheduled stops at Church Siding before this date. Freight trains are recorded as stopping at Church Siding to load goods as late as 1899. Church Siding was the scene of the Tramway's only fatal accident, on 8 March 1883.|$|E

2500|$|Thirty years later, {{the video}} of Fisk trying to wave the ball fair {{remains one of the}} game's {{enduring}} images. Game 6 is often considered one of the best games played in Major League history. The crowd remembered that magical moment at precisely 12:34a.m. ET early on the morning of October 22, 1975, when Fisk drove a 1–0 fastball from Cincinnati right-hander Pat Darcy high into the air, <b>heading</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> left-field line. [...] "The ball only took about two and half seconds", recalled Fisk. [...] "It seemed like I was jumping and waving for more than two and a half seconds." [...] Two and a half seconds later, the ball caromed off the bright yellow pole, ending {{one of the most dramatic}} World Series games ever played and giving the Red Sox a 7–6 win over the Reds in 12 hard-fought innings.|$|E
2500|$|The 2008 racing {{calendar}} {{consisted of}} 18 rounds in 15 different countries (Qatar, Spain which hosted three rounds, Portugal, China, France, Italy, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, the US which hosted two rounds, Czech Republic, San Marino, Japan, Australia and Malaysia). Exclusive to the MotoGP class, {{there was also}} a US round at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca in Monterey, California, for the 800cc class only; this was because the paddock was not large enough to also include the other two classes. In 2008, a MotoGP event was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway {{for the first time on}} a newly prepared track. All three classes were scheduled to race but severe wind and rain prevented the 250cc class from racing.

2500|$|Baggott got {{the idea}} to write Farewell to Reality and become a science activist when {{watching}} the BBC program What is Reality. In his opinion, the program started out well, but became what he calls [...] "fairy tale physics" [...] when it included interviews with theoretical physicists who talked about such ideas as multiverse, superstring theory, and supersymmetry. These topics, according to Baggott, are fascinating to read about and are an entertaining way to make documentaries, sell books, or spend time at parties, but are [...] "abstracted, theoretical speculation without any kind of empirical foundation" [...] and [...] "not science". Farewell to Reality is Baggott's attempt to counteract the [...] "fuzzy science theory" [...] and advocate for evidence and facts. Baggott states, [...] "When you start asking 'Do {{we live in a}} hologram?'

This win put Uruguay through to the quarter-finals {{for the first time}} since 1970. In the quarter-final against Ghana, the score was 1–1 at the end of {{regulation}} and the match went into extra time. Late in extra time, Ghana sent a free-kick into the box, and Suárez blocked Stephen Appiah's shot on the goal line.

As the five red lights went out to signal the beginning of the event, Leimer fended off pressure from the fast-starting Coletti to maintain his pole position advantage in the opening sequence of corners. Coletti had forced Leimer to defend the lead at the fourth turn and drew alongside the latter through turns five and six but could not overtake him. Bird made a quick start and was able to move past Rossi and Quaife-Hobbs in the centre of the circuit for third position. Palmer also made a fast getaway and ran in fifth place after he passed Rossi <b>heading</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> main straight. De Jong became the race's first retirement after the first lap was over when he limped back to the pit lane. He was joined by Varhaug on lap five who had mechanical trouble.|$|E
2500|$|The race {{began at}} 15:35 local time. The {{conditions}} on the grid {{at the start of}} the race were dry but cloudy with an air temperature of [...] and an track temperature at [...] When the Grand Prix started from its standing start, Jarvis ran with little wing angle to give him an advantage in the highland part of the circuit and this enabled him to make a fast getaway and maintain his pole position advantage heading into the first corner. Asmer briefly got alongside Jarvis off the line but fell to fourth behind Oshima and Bird shortly after. Oshima attempted to move in front of Jarvis but the latter fended off the attacks and Oshima was forced to ease off the accelerator pedal. The first retirement of the race came on the first lap when Buurman tried to gain ground but was unable to get any further than San Francisco Bend with three wheels attached to his vehicle. On the next lap, Breen became the second driver to pull out of the Grand Prix. Upfront, Jarvis was steadily opening up an advantage over Oshima. Asmer moved back into third place by running in the slipstream of Bird's car <b>heading</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> main straight and retook the position under braking for Lisboa corner on the start on the same lap.|$|E
